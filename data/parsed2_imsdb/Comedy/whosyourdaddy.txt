written by maria veltre jack sekowski we fly high above heavenly clouds
beneath a brilliant blue sky
a teenaged boys voice greets us
on any given day your life can change in the blink of an eye
its a cliche i know
descending through the clouds we are caught for a moment in a dreamy gauze
we emerge to find ourselves gliding above a small town
to xenia ohio
but a lot of cliches get to be cliches because theyre true
your life can change in the blink of an eye
what i mean is one day youre a regular chump a wannabe something
youre not even totally sure what you wannabe
we pass over the town square
a fine spring day in middle america
red brick buildings with names like miller son drugs two sisters gifts nelson family market
you can almost smell the rosy cheeks and moral fiber
the next day the doorbell rings and some strangers holding your ticket to being somebody
still flying over the town we focus on a teenaged boy on a schwinn
we follow as he pedals his way to
a three story building
older brick sturdy
it happens every day
dreams come true
and not just for those dim witted chain smoking hillbillies you see on tv
you know the ones who win the super lotto and spend their fortune on a truck full of goobers and a new set of front teeth
it could happen to any guy any time
a janitor raises the american flag
it flaps proudly as the teenager chains his bike to a bike rack
he glances up at the flag which is reflected in his uber hip sunglasses
when he smiles in slow mo his teeth seem to sparkle
uh thats not me
im over here
we swish pan to another teenager locking his bike
meet our much less glamorous hero ted nelson
a decent looking kid
not hip enough to be cool
not square enough to be tormented
he joins the other kids heading into the school
youre disappointed i know
i admit i was hopeless back then
the do the shades ugh
but i always had good taste in women
christy malone fills her cheerleader uniform in all the right places
we watch her at her locker
also in slow mo
which makes even her most mundane task seem graceful
wow just look at her stack those books
thats christy malone
head cheerleader love of my life lust of my loins
christy glances off screen and squeals excitedly
another cheerleader enters the frame holding a newspaper called exposed
christy reads the headline
health teacher flunks her own lesson
its miss pratt smoking a doobie
christy calls to ted
look at this ted
imagine if we did this in the school paper
she shows him exposed
happy just to be this close to christy
but they are quickly interrupted by
hand them over
principal richard merkin mid s marches down the hallway seizing copies of exposed
from students hands
we can see that it is a homemade looking newspaper
and theres obviously much ado about it
christy winks at ted as she hides the newspaper in her locker
freeze frame on christy winking
look at that smile
thats no platonic wink
thats a wink that says i dont just want you ted
i need you
so of course i had to ask her to the prom
i mean she was practically begging for it
ted ambles toward christy
struggling for nonchalance
she limbers up by stretching her leg high against the wall
she whispers to another cheerleader
then christy turns to ted
flashing that perfect smile of hers
just the guy ive been looking for
ted wipes his sweaty palms on his jeans
ive been looking for you too
christy continues stretching
driving ted crazy with her contortionist moves
wouldnt it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing
sotto from your lips to gods ears
you go first
the proms coming up
and i was wondering
if you dont have
she looks up at him with gorgeous blue eyes
would you please please please take me to the prom
are you serious
of course i will
christy joyously jumps into teds arms
wrapping her legs around him in a passionate embrace
the entire room you are the most wonderful guy in the whole wide world and i love you madly teddy nelson
and just as shes about to plant one right on his lips
the shrill ringing of a tornado drill alarm snaps ted out of his reverie
a large glass window separates teds editor in chief office from the rest of the school newsroom
we realize now that ted has only been gazing through the window at christy watching her stretch those gorgeous limbs of hers
sorry about that
a cheap trick i know
but its my story and my fantasy
so cut me some slack
he follows the other students to
ted joins his schoolmates lining up on both sides of the hallway
far from any windows
they all know the drill
christys just across the hall from ted
he cant take his eyes off of her
charlie duke approaches ted
hes got a camera around his neck and so much confidence its a wonder he can balance his head on his shoulders
come on bro
spare yourself the humiliation the degradation
you and your pep talks
dont get me wrong
we can salivate over all the christy malones of our lives
wishing we could devour them like melt in your mouth filet mignon
but were strictly hamburger guys
ground chuck sixty eight percent lean is about the best we can hope for
my best friend
hes into beef analogies partly because hes a butchers son and partly because well hes just into beef analogies
what can i say
hes also a photographer
charlie kneels by the sidelines
shooting cheerleaders with his nikon and an obscenely long lens
a very gifted photographer
a cheerleaders ripe buttocks peeking out from beneath a short pleated skirt
as she kicks and jumps her little red panties wedge themselves firmly between her cheeks
the camera skillfully tracks her movements waiting until
the cheerleaders hand comes down
in slow mo her finger slips under her panties and tugs on the fabric pulling it over her cheeks
charlies motor drive whirls
the senior class voted him most likely to have a restraining order filed against him
but thats another story
ted and charlie lean against the wall
i genuinely think she wants me
i feel a vibe
that vibe is from your wrist pal
youve been over tenderizing your meat again
christy catches teds eye and smiles a perfect smile
did you see that
she smiles at everyone ted
shes like a newborn with gas
charlie secretly shows ted a nudie magazine
a gorgeous woman with perfect breasts graces the cover
a golden halo over her head
charlie flips it open
points to a picture
the only chick more untouchable than christy malone is miss april
feminine voice hi my names ginger
i love tofu burgers rainy nights and riding bareback
my biggest turn off is cell phones during sex
heres a tip set it on vibrate honey and dont be stingy with the lube
winking at ted dont knock it till you tried it
were you always this sick
one thing for sure christy malone aint lookin that good naked
ted takes a peek at ginger
then at christy
someday ill find out
you have a better chance of being hit by a mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip
ted grabs the magazine and flips through more pages
beautiful naked women
the stuff that fantasies are made of
ted looks determined
i defy your hamburger theory of life and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents
thats crazy talk
i defy any and all limits
charlie can see the look in teds eyes
hes about to do something bold and daring
something hell regret
dont do it ted
dont do it
walking away defiantly any time any day a man can completely reinvent himself
ted starts to walk across the corridor ignoring charlie
im warning you
this is an official warning
danger will robinson danger
a quietly attractive teenaged girl julie conroy watches ted
she seems concerned too
theres one more person you should meet
someone integral to my story
thats julie conroy
unlike the rest of these losers she didnt grow up in xenia ohio
i just met her that day
but already she had made a difference in my life
teachers mill around
snacking on donuts coffee
principal merkin bursts in spilling a stack of exposed
onto a table
oh miss pratt miss pratt
what were you thinking
how could you be so careless
reading exposing hypocrisy in the morons who teach us
thats the little bastards motto
the teachers turn to miss pratt
we recognize her from the cover of exposed
summoning courage principal merkin i realize we have to teach the children that recreational drugs are the devils work but that doesnt mean we dont dance with the prince of
darkness ourselves every now and again
ah well bravo
thats just what well tell the school board
suddenly an air vent pops open and crashes on top of a coffee machine
the whole room in shocked silence turns to look at
julie her head framed by the air duct
she holds a digital camera in her hand
her expression says oh shit
principal merkin narrows his eyes at the little bastard who has been making his life hell
julie sits in a chair in front of teds desk
she and ted size up one another
merks punishment was cruel
expulsion without appeal
or working for me on the school paper
the school paper would be torture for a gonzo reporter like julie and we both knew it
but what choice did she have
julie leans back on the chair rests her feet on teds files and blows a huge bubble
so william randolph
your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of rice crispie treats and chocolate snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale
thats just one example
my reporting has made a difference
let me guess retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof
the school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable
my award winning expose changed all that
the city added an extra weekday trash pick up
is it true
is ignorance bliss
look i loved exposed
and i hate it that you got busted
i know the school paper sucks in comparison but its really not that bad
teds eyes wander to christy who prances around the newsroom
dont even tell me youre hot for miss titty pom poms over there
christys a very talented journalist
i see a pulitzer in her future
i didnt know they gave them for best lip gloss retention during a blow job
ask her to the prom
get it over with
i have absolutely no intention do it
i triple dog dare you
ted nears christy
students stare as he passes
they elbow one another
so you see this is really about a triple dog dare
i dont even know what it means
i just know unless its a felony a triple dog dare pretty much has to be met with immediate action
ted seems unaware that all eyes are upon him
the cacophony of the corridor settles
he gets down on one knee in front of christy
christy looks down on ted
smiles that smile
which freezes as her eyes dart
realizing that everyone is staring at them with great anticipation
uh christy i was wondering
the corridor explodes with laughter
ted flushes with embarrassment
christy looks mortified
through gritted teeth ted have you lost your mind
you like me
i like you
i guess its pretty obvious to everyone
i dont like you
were just but that smile
oh ted duh
i smile at everyone since i got my braces off
so youll think about it
christy laughs derisively
you really dont get it do you
i am genetically programmed to desire a big buff manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring
its like a caveman thing
so thats a maybe
the answer is never ted never
except maybe in your dreams
leaving ted kneeling there
unless you count the hoards of students who are watching and laughing in my dreams
repeating chanting this is a dream
this is only a dream
gives him a hand
helps him up
this is an actual emergency
ted pukes in the sink
i tried to warn you william randolph
shes got stiletto heels hidden in those keds
but you triple dog dared me
it was for your own good in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way
one word my friend
ted lifts his head
looks in the mirror
theres gotta be more to life than meatloaf
not a hair above middle class
home sweet home nonetheless
dinner in progress
mom dad ted younger brother jimmy
a mutt named corky curled under the table
a storm brews
lightning in the distance
teds mom observes her son with unmistakable mom radar
she slides a slab of rotten timing
meat loaf onto his plate with an unpleasant thud
if i never eat another bite of meat loaf again itll be too soon
teds mom frowns
jimmy explains matter of factly
meatloaf has come to represent all that ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in
hes what youd call clinically bummed
why cant we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little london broil
i mean for gods sake we own a grocery store
teds parents look at one another shake their heads
his dad gently explains
we heard about christy son
jimmy tries to stifle a grin
what is this
does everybody know everything im about to say or do every freakin minute of the day
no cursing in this house young man
use the strong vocabulary god gave you
i dont have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town
we understand your disappointment teddy
christy is a pretty sexy provocative voluptuous
catches himself we
we understand your disappointment
its my private business
can the tantrum sweet pea
were the good guys remember
dont allow this disturbing behavior to furrow your collective brow
teds just experiencing some post adolescent turmoil coming to terms with the whole small town dynamic
i hate xenia
i hate my life
ted charges for the front door
and until that moment this was the worst day of my seventeen and a half years
and then it happened
three two one
ted bursts outside and plows straight into marty zukerman a short rotund man in his mid s
zukermans briefcase and papers are knocked to the ground
ted helps to retrieve them
in a hurry are we
i was in the middle of a melodramatic exit
it wouldnt really make a statement if i tiptoed out the door
what are you selling
people pay good money for that
im just a messenger
ted starts to back away
instinctively knowing the bad news must be for him
ive had all the bad news i can take for one day
its about your parents
what do you mean
im terrible at this
im a blurter
they exist no further
off teds confusion skinny dipping
it wasnt pretty
youve got the wrong guy
the closest my parents have been to the amazon is the brazilian pavilion at epcot
well kid im speaking of
your biological parents
ted sits on the couch bewildered
dad beside him
mom pours coffee in her best china
zukerman regards a wall of family photos as he takes a sip
the will reading is next tuesday
naturally all of teds expenses will be taken care of
teds parents look worried
mom reminds dad
we have a truckload of strawberries arriving on tuesday morning
explaining to zukerman we own a small family grocery store
quietly moping its spring break
i dont want to go to a will reading
thats part of growing up honey
having spring break ruined by will readings
you know what your mother means
all right i can give you two tickets prepaid but you must be there
theres no other way
allow me to accompany ted
i can assure you ill be the level headed sidekick to your angst ridden teen
i think ted should take someone older more responsible
what about charlie
you boys could make it a little adventure
charlie at a will reading
what did i do to deserve this
lightning strikes again
thunder rumbles a second later
the lights flicker
and its pitch black
candles light the dark room
rain pours hard outside
journalism mementos all over teds walls
theres even a faux pulitzer a christmas gift from his parents
teds dad sits on the edge of his bed
i remember spring break of my senior year
seems like a lifetime ago
grandpa was so strong back then
working from the crack of dawn
so proud of his peaches
remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out i knew more than you
youre way ahead of me again
it was the year of the rhizopus rot
grandpa almost lost the farm
you sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival
and in the end you saved the peaches and you didnt have to slaughter your sow
the lesson being
sometimes you have to do stuff you dont want to do
its all part of growing up
and it usually works out peachy in the end
im getting so good at this
dad chuckles but teds still moping
you guys are my parents
of course we are
they didnt want me when i was born
why should i care
if theyre dead
well why should i
they had a rough life
your father was a bouncer
your mother was well a two bit stripper
there was no place for a baby
they did do one great thing
they gave us our boy
be a sport
how bad could spring break in los angeles be
i guess we could go to disneyland or something
think of it as a rite of passage to manhood
like one of those national geographic specials with the topless chicks
whatever helps you cope
i guess its better than having tribal patterns carved in my face
there ya go
always remember focus on the peach
not the pit
teds dad hugs him briefly laughing
always one step ahead of your dear old dad
a lands screaming on the runway
ted and charlie exit the plane
they walk tentatively through the sleeve towards the entry gate
i wonder if this is what it feels like to be born
ted gives him a look
think about it
long tunnel bright lights its full of vaginal symbolism
poor freud turning in his grave
seriously its like were being reborn
we really could reinvent ourselves here just like you said
nobody knows about your massive humiliation
nobody knows about your mental retardation
nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation
nobody knows about your constant masturbation
and nobody knows youre a virgin
after a beat aw who are we kidding
charlies words echo loudly through the sleeve
people stare at ted as they pass
i think ill reinvent a new best friend
ted and charlie enter the terminal
friends and family wait for loved ones
a few chauffeurs hold signs with names
one stands out
in a short skirt
a matching low cut jacket
and a cap
and shes holding a sign that reads ted nelson
what are the odds of there being another ted nelson on our flight
they grin at one another
then approach the chauffeur
hi im ted nelson
with a sad look the chauffeur hugs him kissing one cheek then the other
im so terribly sorry for your loss
your father was a great man
charlie leans in and whispers
who the hell was your father
well dad said
ted and charlie sit on opposites ends of the plush interior
charlie eyes the control console with its slew of gadgets
they practically have to shout to hear one another
are you serious
maybe he got promoted
charlie continues playing with the console switches
rock music pulsates through the limo
shouting this is the life baby
we get ourselves some tail and were talking spring break
cut it out before you break something
for a guy about to try his first dom perignon you are extremely uptight
he flips another switch
the bar opens
revealing a bottle of dom perignon on ice
charlie grins broadly
we cant afford that
charlie grabs the bottle and starts to open it
dont you know anything about limo etiquette
everything in here is included for our pleasure
wait a second i thought we were hamburger guys
and like every hamburger guy knows when you get your one big chance at the good life you abuse every second of it until they figure out you dont belong
there and kick your sorry ass out
the cork flies through the air
bounces off the ceiling
and hits another switch
the sun roof glides open
champagne overflows from the bottle
all over charlies crotch
is that in the limo etiquette handbook too
charlie grabs a bar towel as ted looks toward the sun roof
beautifully blue southern california sky greets him
with an occasional palm tree swooshing by
teds head peeks out of the sun roof
he takes in the sights as the limo cruises sunset boulevard
people stare at him
a beautiful blonde smiles and waves
he waves back very timidly
charlie sticks his head out too
sun on their faces
wind in their hair
this is how the other half lives bro
enjoy it while you can
the limo passes through the ornate gate of what could only be a sprawling mansion
it comes to a sudden halt
the door swings open to reveal a group of beautiful young women
clad in very short black dresses and even some black bikinis
sad expressions on their faces
the mourners embrace ted
you are so very very welcome here
we feel your pain so deeply
to ted something tells me were not in xenia anymore toto
the beautiful young women guide ted towards the mansion
a particularly voluptuous beauty eyes him curiously
the handsome devoted best friend
were so close we feel each others pain
the voluptuous beauty notices charlies soaked crotch
see what you do to me baby
just then the spry helen mcdole s emerges from the mansion
she approaches ted and hugs him
oh my he would have been so proud
youre the spitting image of him
he never spits maam
he cant even get a good hocker going
ive tried to teach him
it comes from the diaphragm
sharply to charlie youre on the next plane home
emotional embrace im helen mcdole
your fathers executive secretary
ted takes a seat at the spacious conference table
helen sits on his right
charlie sits on his left
zukerman and two other impatient attorneys wait at the head of the table
finally zukerman checks his watch and rises
were running out of time
the kids here
we dont need him
perhaps we could be patient for just a moment or two longer
they all watch a wall clock
seconds pass slowly slowly
then suddenly zukerman rises
what did the doctor say to the nurse as they watched something black and white and red in a blender
a wry smile no more patients
very dramatically zukerman slides a copy of heaven magazine down the conference table
right to ted
are you familiar with heaven
i know it like the back of my hand
your fathered owned the entire heaven empire
you own it now
teds stunned speechless
the publishing division the real estate holdings the retail outlets the theme parks
as far as the eye can see
zukerman presses a remote control
a wall panel slides open to reveal a large monitor which springs to life
on the screen is a striking couple
teds biological parents
heather and tom deeds
heather stunningly sexy and overflowing from her gold sequined halter top
tom very handsome in a vegas showman sort of way
we wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you
but if youre watching this then it means we bit the dust
but dont worry
well be in heaven
the real heaven i mean
not that heaven is an actual place but more like a state of being
or not being
maybe we know now
if youre anything like yours truly then you probably figure we didnt want you when you were born so who cares if were dead
am i right
ted looks guilty
this is too weird
but we did want you
its just that you dont always get to keep what you want
we knew you needed a real mom and dad
we had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this
heather holds up the first issue of heaven
shes on the cover wearing nothing but a halo
she looks almost exactly the same today with a few extra nips and tucks
can you believe that was me
before we knew it we created the most popular mens magazine in the entire nation
the rest is history
so here we are
but we never want you to want for anything
that is we want you to have everything
heather leans forward and blows a kiss into the camera
her strongest assets spilling forward
we love you ted
we always did
we always will
charlies practically slobbering
he elbows ted
i cant believe thats your mother
were talking babe a licious chub fest right here in the s
at that moment the doors burst open
deeds uncle billy sails into the room
handsome in an unconventional way he exudes passion and eccentricity
im so terribly sorry
am i too late
youre just in time to congratulate your nephew
he inherited the empire
a broad smile every morsel of it
it would appear so
uncle billy hugs ted with great enthusiasm
welcome to the family ted
you are going to breathe some new life into this place
you are going to set the world on fire
you are going to
call me uncle billy
awkwardly uh sure
i have only one concern
swept up by uncle billys spirit
you do like girls dont you
of course i like girls
i mean a whole lot
as much as possible
to the rescue he likes them with the unbridled enthusiasm of a seventeen year old virgin whos been making mental beef jerky since he saw the bevy of tender young
skirt steaks at his new hacienda
uncle billy grins broadly
thats my boy
uncle billy leads ted and charlie through the cavernous room
sexy semi clad oil paintings of teds biological mother adorn the walls
the parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy
which is seldom
you said parties but you meant orgies right
to ted quietly stick with me
i know their codes
uncle billy winks at ted
the orgies exactly
take a deep breath
you can smell it
pure sexuality oozing from the walls
charlie takes a deep breath
uncle billy and ted share a conspiratorial smirk
the epitome of every boys dream arcade
everything from classic pinball machines to the most high tech virtual reality game that has yet to hit the market
charlie shakes his head in amazement
naked girls wild sex video games
no wonder its called heaven
this is a fun place
but we dont usually come here until after the orgies
playing along ah in other words this is the apres orgy salon
indeed it is
during the day visitors prefer to be outside au naturel
as it were
charlie continues to gawk
teds equally impressed but holding it together
uncle billy leads ted and charlie by the indoor pool which is decorated like a tropical pond complete with exotic vegetation lava rocks and a waterfall
they pass through a cave like entrance and find themselves
coming out by another spectacular waterfall
which separates the indoor and outdoor pools
numerous beautiful women swim chat play water polo
some topless some might as well be
the boys watch in awe as one woman rubs lotion on another womans back
have you met ted
the women wave ad libbing warm greetings
charlie leans towards ted confiding
this is like my every wet dream come true
i dont even care that youre here too bro
fake it if you have to
good advice ted
you have your fathers instincts
the words sound so strange
he never even met the guy
just remember youre not the man you were a day ago
and these girls lets just say theyd be eager to please you
its hard to believe this is real
i wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight
this isnt some s porno film you dip shit
there are no wild sex orgies
maybe not yet
never say never
a beautiful woman sensuously rubs tanning lotion over her own breasts
the boys stare riveted
i really love your peaches wanna shake your tree
uncle billy grins
maybe she needs help ted
you should be a gentleman
voice cracking i
i think shes doing fine on her own
having a moment oh baby yes yes yes
fuck me like you mean it
ted elbows charlie out of his fantasy
you kiss your mother with that mouth
id kiss your mother with this mouth
i mean if she wasnt you know
he means dead
so far away
mom waits nervously for the phone to ring
is that you
dad hurries out of the bathroom hiking up his pajamas
mom speaks loudly as if teds in siberia
how are you baby
are you all right
a palatial suite
very louis xiv
ted throws a sheet over a nude sculpture of his biological mother
while holding a cordless phone in the crook of his neck
im all right mom
im not in siberia you know
did you have a nice flight
are they taking good care of you
yeah im doing fine
i have so much to tell you
i dont even know where to begin
save it honey
we want to hear every detail when you get back but we dont want you to run up mr
zukermans phone bill
its okay mom
mom hands dad the phone
ted its your dad
i have a question for you
i dont know how to put it tactfully
you know im lousy with words
just say it dad
i know they were simple people but did this trip help your college fund at all
dad lets just say i can buy anything i want in the whole bookstore
including the bookstore
not getting it well good
every little bit helps
suddenly charlie bursts into the room with a pair of binoculars
check this out
i better go dad
well see you soon
have fun in
trying to be hip the land of fruits and nuts
charlie flips off the light switch and whispers
to charlie what is it now
check it out
charlie shoves the binoculars at ted and guides him toward the window which overlooks the outdoor pool
dont tell me
another vision of incomparable beauty
were talking goddess
a devastatingly perfect woman ginger miss april emerges from the pool wearing nothing but a g string
her skin shimmers from the reflection of the pool lights
rivulets of water stream down her body
she reaches for a towel and pats her body dry
an incredible aura seems to surround her
separating her from the other spectacular beauties weve seen already
ted lowers the binoculars
i get it now
you and me
our plane crashed
in the grand canyon
a big fiery explosion
we never made it to l
they needed dental records to identify us
and this place
then there must be a whole room made completely of chocolate
and some really fast cars
ted and charlie move like thieves in the night
dont be such a pansy
all of this is yours
its a lot to digest
imagine how youd feel
id feel like staying up all night
or at least till i got the lay of the land so to speak
ted and charlie enter
flip the light switch
it was his parents very opulent bedroom
complete with more risque paintings of teds biological mother
i feel like im entering a forbidden tomb
where they get all the really good porno channels on cable
charlie pulls open a dresser drawer filled with teds mothers lingerie
charlie caresses a pair of red silk panties and inhales their powdery fragrance
oh how inappropriate is that
take a whiff of heaven
how would you like it if i did that to your mothers panties
id call you a sick twisted fuck
but this is different
she wasnt your mother mother give me those
ted grabs the panties just as charlie pulls away ripping them in half
just then the door opens to reveal a very proper english butler
i do apologize sir
i heard a noise
ted and charlie awkwardly hide the panty halves behind their backs
we were just i completely understand sir
ill leave you to your business
the butler leaves
ted glares at charlie
a couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what hes seen
sarcastic yeah hes probably been serving cocktails so to speak at the orgies
the garage is crowded with two dozen sporty classics
ted runs his hands over the hood of a red ferrari m maranello
he pulls the door open and slides into the leather seat
wanna take me for a ride
ted turns around and spots ginger the goddess from the pool making her way towards him
i i dont have the keys
theyre in the ignition silly
ted glances down
there they are
she hops in next to him
he doesnt know what to do
you do know how to drive
i dont have much experience with a
want a lesson
he needs a lot of lessons
press your left foot on the clutch
and turn the key
the ferrari growls to life
ginger places her hand over teds
now release the brake
and slide the stick into first gear
ginger moves her slender fingers on his knees
showing him how its done
now very carefully apply some pressure to the gas pedal with your right foot as you release the clutch with your left
she squeezes his thigh and winks
the ferrari jerks out of the garage and promptly stalls
could ted be more embarrassed
the first time can be awkward
you just have to get on and try again
i dont even know if i should be doing this
its a very expensive car
its your car
these are all your cars
some of them have to be automatics
your father liked shifting
he said it brought him closer to the engine
like a woman purring with ecstasy
ted feels his temperature rising
he changes the subject
im ted by the way
i think i forgot to say that
the one with the horses
i almost didnt recognize you without
that stallion between
that sounded so much better in my head
ted tries to hide behind his less than cool shades
wanna go shopping
i should tell my friend
he found the chocolate room
big grin hi ho silver
he puts the car in gear
the tires scream as they take off
gears grind as he shifts
not exactly purring with ecstasy
the ferrari negotiates its way along rodeo drive
ted seems to have gotten the hang of it
one snaps a photo
ted pulls up to
and then over
well he almost has the hang of it
ted emerges from a dressing room
slowly starting to lose his boy from xenia taint
he glances at the price tag dangling from his sleeve
his eyes widen
ginger strokes his arm
whispers seductively in his ear
your father always said money matters only to the man who doesnt have it
trying to learn
ted tries on some snazzy sunglasses
ted still checks the price tag
ginger looks into his eyes
as if she can see his soul
who exactly are you
uncomfortable what do you mean
im ted nelson
and who is ted nelson
teds not sure how to respond
he smiles awkwardly
is he a small town boy destined to live an ordinary life with an ordinary wife and a tiny house with a boring old white picket fence
the hamburger life
now he can defy it
or do you have a taste for the good life ted
its in your blood
i always knew there was more
i felt it
then remember you are the heir to a billion dollar empire
you have a staff of literally thousands
multiply everything you ever imagined by a million and you still cant even wrap your head around everything that is yours
all ted slides on the shades
he grins at the sales clerk
ill take the whole case
ted charlie helen and uncle billy walk past graphic designers in cubicles as helen leads a tour of the heaven magazine offices
as they pass each cubicle heads pop up to check them out
polaroids of naked women cover every square inch of wall space
ted and charlie gawk
who can blame them
every one of these women thinks she should be the next angel of the month
its your job ted to decide which of them is right
let me get this straight
if it isnt straight by now son you probably should see a doctor
these are real live women
winking at ted we dont generally feature blow up dolls in our magazine
but hey if you think theres a market for it
god i love being dead
ted focuses on one particular picture
he removes the push pin that holds it to the wall
i like her
we can see the concerned look on helens face
does this kid have any taste at all
relieved nice choice
theres only one problem
she shows uncle billy
you think she upgraded
they went in through the belly button
uncle billy nods
he explains gently
we dont allow tipn ted
tattoos implants piercings nose jobs
our angels must be pure unadultered completely natural
ted looks at the walls again
he has a knack for this
he hands a picture to helen
she turns to uncle billy and smiles
emotional you have your fathers eye
he just cant get used to that
who was this guy
ted looks at the impressive collection of suits
runs his hands along the fabrics
picks a particularly stylish jacket and tries it on
it fits poorly
too big in the chest and shoulders
ted looks at himself in the full length mirror
hes not half the man his father was
suddenly theres a knock on the door
ted quickly takes off his fathers jacket and puts on his own
he lets uncle billy in
loud party sounds momentarily pour into the room
there you are ted baby
everything all right
teds struggling with a silk tie
uncle billy helps him
you ready for your big coming out party
everybodys dying to meet you
just a couple of finishing touches
my parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression
puzzled they said that
realizing oh your parents
i like that
ted wipes his palms on his slacks
truth is im a little nervous
why on earth should you be nervous
all those people out there
its a lot of pressure
you laugh in the face of pressure
you are a multi media magnate
the tycoon of tits
the baron of bottoms
uncle billys calming him
you are the emperor of every little girl who dreamed of growing up to see her naughty bits spread eagle airbrushed to glossy perfection with staples through her ass
uncle billy rubs his shoulders
as if pep talking him for a big fight
youre the sultan of semen
the monarch of masturbation
the merchant prince of lust
are the king of coitus
the king of coitus
the supreme sovereign of sexuality
thats the thing
he whispers ive never even actually
interrupting why look whos here
uncle billy swings the door open to reveal
kiki and kelly
tall beautiful leggy identical twins
they smile warmly at ted each offering an arm
ted holds his head high
like the sovereign of sexuality
with the twins on either side of him ted struts down the stairs and into a sea of people
all so eager to meet him
ted acts as if hes been doing this all his life
sotto the potentate of poon has arrived
and instantly hes surrounded
people shake his hands
women kiss his cheeks
athletes movie stars models
charlie watches beaming proudly
charlie thinks hes travolta
dressed for disco
twirling a super model
ted dances among a dozen beauties
they steal kisses and hugs here and there
a thousand cinderellas all after one prince charming
teds having the time of his life
charlie dances up to him
shouting in his ear
aint life amazing
a week ago you couldnt get to second base
now you own second base
they high five one another
an exotic beauty grabs ted and starts dirty dancing
rubbing herself against him
so he improvises
people cheer him on
he thrusts his pelvis
feigns various sex acts
hilarious goofy but it works
the partys over
ted relaxes in the jacuzzi sipping champagne
thrilled elated blasted
uncle billy sits across from him
two masseuses tenderize their shoulders
but as the scene continues the women take an even greater interest in each other
stealing a kiss here
a touch there
ted attention is distracted as he chats with uncle billy
i told you you could do it
i was like a different person tonight
you were the new and improved you
i would have been laughed right out of xenia
no one will be laughing at you now ted
you can take that to the bank
its really going to be strange going home in a couple of days
you are home
but go ahead finish school do what you feel you need to do
in the meantime ill be your point person here on the magazine
youd do that for me
ive been very lazy for a long long time
you seem like youre anything but lazy uncle billy
confiding i never finished school myself
never had to
my brother built this empire from nothing but his wifes perky tits and a whole lot of gumption
he gave me a cushy job on a silver platter
i never struggled for a second
my parents always say hard work builds character
its not like i didnt have ideas i had plenty of ideas
but i never even shared them with your father
never had the guts
what kind of ideas
for one thing
i think its despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of classic beauty
you think we should be more open minded
the world is a big beautiful place
we can open new markets in africa and asia
imagine the dali lhama reading our magazine
in other words our scope is too narrow
at our press conference tomorrow i think we should announce our plans to explore the world
not just a few leggy ds with blond hair upstairs and down
the masseuses help uncle billy out of the jacuzzi
they say their goodnights and ted closes his eyes
when he opens them ginger stands at the edge of the tub
want some company
ted can barely nod
she unzips the back of her dress and lets it fall to her feet
the silhouette of her nude body is startlingly gorgeous in the moonlight
ted watches as she descends step by step into the frothy water
teds paralyzed with desire and fear
ginger descends deeper
a wash of foam caresses her breasts
until shes completely submerged
ted looks startled
the jaws theme echoes through his ears
he starts to rise
when suddenly he feels something
his swimming trunks land next to him
he starts to rise out of the jacuzzi when suddenly hes sucked under
his hand grabs the edge of the jacuzzi
but his fingers give out
and he slides under
only to rise out of the water with ginger
attached to his lips
kissing him passionately
ted and ginger in bed
morning rays satin sheets what a night
he stares at ginger in awe remembering what happened
ted slides out of bed
catches his reflection in the mirror
takes a good look at himself
posing cool whos your daddy
lights cameras reporters bedlam
uncle billy helen and ted sit at a makeshift dais
my brilliant extraordinary nephew ted nelson has brought enough fresh blood to this company to make all of transylvania happy for the next fifty or sixty years
ill give him the mike now and youll see what i mean
this apple didnt fall far from the tree
ted prepares to speak
a little nervous from the spotlights but hell hes a man now
uncle billy gives him a reassuring look
whispering dont forget to tell them all your qualifications
im ted nelson
i guess you already know that part
proud of himself for two years ive been the editor of the high school paper in xenia ohio
ive won some awards made a difference
ive always had journalism in my soul
now i know why
he glances at uncle billy who urges him to tell more
they tell me ive got my fathers taste in women and cars
winking the faster the better
chuckles from the crowd
uncle billy gives him a thumbs up sign
and im really looking forward to the challenge of bringing heaven magazine into the st century
in the middle of waxing her bikini line christy jumps up and down excitedly
he asked me to the prom
were practically engaged
julie watches tv
he reinvented himself into a dick
principal merkin watches tv
you dont even have your high school diploma yet mr
im still the boss of you
teds parents and little jimmy stare in amazement at their old fashioned console rca
a geeky high school picture of ted appears on screen as a reporter babbles
the big question now remains will success spoil ted nelson the straight a journalism student from xenia ohio whose life was transformed overnight when he found out he was rich
powerful and certainly the most eligible bachelor in the entire nation
shocked our teddy inherited heaven
he said he was set for book money
jimmy turns to his parents
forget about roller blades for my birthday
id prefer a dna test
can you prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that i am not for example a guccione
the door bell chimes
mom and dad look at each other
this cant be good
dad opens the front door to reveal a delivery man holding a flashy new bike
delivery for jimmy nelson
jimmy squeezes past dad and jumps on the bike as mom appears in the doorway
my goodness who sent this
its from heaven maam
riding around i love you ted
we cant accept it
its much too expensive
of course dumpling
its very nice of ted but
at that moment another delivery man and his helper unload a large crate from another truck
they approach dad and mom
delivery for robert nelson
what is it
appears to be tools sir
teds gone completely overboard
dad approaches the crate as the delivery man opens it to reveal a large scarlet and gray case of tools
dad opens one of the drawers
runs his fingers over the shiny instruments
tears in his eyes
sweetheart what is it
i always wanted craftsman tools
he even got me the limited edition buckeye colors
we cant accept this extravagance
another delivery truck arrives
then the local news vans
neighbors rush out of their houses
the phone rings
mom dashes inside
mom grabs the phone
is that you
ted wears a cordless headset phone as if he was born with it
as he talks he flexes his muscles in front of a full length mirror
what is all this
when are you coming home
just a few tokens of my affection
ill be back soon dont worry
everything is lovely ted but much too expensive
i could buy all that and the factories they came from
mom looks up as another delivery man wheels a washing machine and dryer into the house
where do you want them lady
moms eyes light up
oh good lord
are those neptunes
only the best for my mother
softening you promise youll finish school
ill make you very proud
a beautiful spring morning
cars pull into the school parking lot
students mingle in small groups
making their way into the building
a group of guys look up
suddenly a helicopter swooshes through the air circling the school as if to get everyones attention then landing on a grassy knoll
the helicopter is painted heavenly blue with a pattern of white billowy clouds
the door slides open and out hops ted
in slow mo
looking seriously cool from the tips of his silver toed boots to his stylish persol shades
until he takes a second step and stumbles slightly catching himself from falling face first into the grass
charlie is right behind him
looking great too but vaguely mafioso in his efforts to be hip
he turns to the beautiful blonde pilot and plants a big wet kiss for everyone to see
ted and charlie strut towards the school as principal merkin bursts through the front doors shouting
you cannot land a helicopter in my school yard
get that blasted thing out of here
ted raises his hand
the chopper rises as if on cue
without a word ted and charlie pass the ruffled principal merkin and strut toward the entrance
classmates surround ted
everyone wanting to be teds new best friend
julie walks up to charlie
what gives don corleone
smug we reinvented ourselves
new hushpuppies dont make a new man
youve obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar italian loafers
that explains the emptiness that haunts me
jealousy is so unattractive
ted makes eye contact with julie
winking like hes don juan
she just stares at him blankly
second only to unfettered arrogance and the inability to see the irony therein
charlies baffled by that one
wanna see my hickey from miss december
principal merkin paces dramatically
i like you ted
you know that
i liked you before you were filthy rich
thanks principal merkin
ill be blunt
i know you can take it
ill brace myself
ted you are the best editor this school paper ever had
you dont need to be pandering flesh
its beneath you
you think i ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks
i dont want your silly billion dollar empire
thats a good start yes
a very good start
are you kidding
this magazine is my dream
its every red blooded heterosexual males dream
i never figured you for a pimp
have you ever even looked at heaven
what kind of sick question is that
ill be watching you young man
your money and power mean nothing here
i guess you wont be wanting that rolex i sent you then
principal merkin opens his desk drawer sheepishly
caresses the watch
it kills him to return it
no i wont
for reminding me
flurry of activity
ted on his cell phone
julie types furiously
taking her job very seriously
christy malone props one leg against the wall
demonstrating those contortionist warm up moves that drove ted mad with desire
great jacket teddy bear
hanging up phone yeah
makes your shoulders look so big and broad
a few billion bucks and suddenly hes cro magnon man of the year
its so nice to have friends like you christy
wishing she never said the f word
ted takes julies arm and guides her to a private spot in the corner
what is it william randolph
your balls need scratching
your article sucked
in what sense
in the sense that there is no hidden agenda behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs
it was so well hidden you didnt even know it was there
come on julie
dont screw up
you have some real talent
just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesnt mean youre even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago
im trying to help
im still better than you
nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account
thats not entirely true
julie snaps her fingers as if trying to remember
youre probably not a virgin anymore
but as far as being a hack that much is status quo
she really knows how to push his buttons
what do you want from me
im trying to be fair
but i cant keep you on staff if you turn every pta meeting into an agent orange cover up
then ill write about you
local boy inherits more money than god
call me crazy but i smell human interest
loving this really
you wanna write about me
a world class chef and his sous chef serve the nelsons a filet mignon dinner
mom dad jimmy ted and julie sit at the table
set with the finest china
the most elegant linens
a fresh floral arrangement
the best of everything
everyone waits for mom as she takes her first bite
ive never tasted anything so tender
the rest of them dig in
beats the heck out of meatloaf
off moms look although your meatloaf is second to none love muffin
jimmys eyes widen as he chews
my trembling taste buds have just been assailed by the bittersweet knowledge of all theyve been missing these past nine years
the chef turns to julie
no offense wolfgang puck but dead flesh is dead flesh
this just happens to be better than most dead flesh on the planet
and finally the chef waits for ted
the chef wipes a bead of sweat from his brow
approval at last from the only opinion that mattered
why thank you sir
ted has bettered our lives to the point where i can no longer see myself as the old jimmy i was but a day or two past
you may all call me james
from this moment forward
finally some gratitude
were grateful ted
its not that
those craftsman tools
theyre a dream come true
your dad and i were raised with a certain work ethic thats all
julie listens closely admiring teds parents
we cant start living like were the rockerfellers or something
the rockerfellers are paupers compared to my favorite brother ted
you dont have to work another day in your lives
but how would we pay our bills
we just barely have enough for your college tuition son
teds frustration mounts
dont you get it
in one day i earn more interest than the stores entire annual revenue
you can do anything you ever wanted to do
after a beat like what
like take that trip to buckingham palace
go deep sea fishing in the gulf of mexico
nows your chance
but those are our dreams son
we have to make them come true
consider me your fairy godfather except without the fairy part
no more mealy apples and bruised bananas ever for the rest of your lives
but who would run the store
forget the store
dad looks at mom
forget the store
ted we put a lot of love in our business
we wanted you and jimmy to have it someday
something real and honest
we love our lives just the way they are
disappointed disgusted ted looks to julie for support
tears fill her eyes
mom and dad moved her
ted shrugs and digs into his food
a heavenly blue jet with billowy white clouds soars through the sky
beyond first class the ultimate in posh
charlie sweet talks a sexy flight attendant
call me charlie
im a photographer for heaven magazine
and a very cunning linguist
the flight attendant pulls him toward the washroom quickly
julie interviews ted complete with tape recorder
i have to admit i always felt
different like a dwarf at a basketball game
or different like a lesbian in pumps
i dont get the distinction
could everybody else tell you were different or were you the only one who knew
i felt limited
i felt confined
i felt like i was suffocating
so more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist
another flight attendant approaches
i prefer my penis at room temperature
she said peanuts you cretin
you never know around here
julie raises her eyebrows
dont write that part
is this an gritty expose or a candy ass press release
write what you want
just try not to make it so obvious that youre crazy about me
amused life must be peachy on planet ted
funny you should say peachy
i did my homework
your grandfather was a peach farmer
my adoptive grandfather
who knows what my biological grandfather did
undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort
ted loves her spunk
and the chemistry between them
considering this is your first time on a private jet on which you are interviewing the worlds most eligible bachelor you are extremely cavalier
i bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on planet ted
youre impertinent rude sarcastic
and this is not my first time on a private jet so quit acting like im rebecca of sunnybrook farm
a little respect would be nice thats all
money cant buy respect ted
saying what you mean
meaning what you say
being an honorable person
thats how you earn respect
ted waits for his appearance on the tonight show
ginger smooths out the imaginary creases in teds armani jacket
great jacket teddy
it makes your shoulders look so big and broad
julie rolls her eyes
here we go again
uncle billy and helen look on approvingly
you do look smashing
sharp as a mashed potato sandwich
ted fake guffaws
charlie is quickly distracted by the relish tray
oh wow look
theyve even got baby gherkins
i have an idea
ill be right back
and she dashes out the door
ted leans towards julie who quietly observes everything
what do you think of her
youre so twitterpated you dont even see the miners hat and the pickax
youre implying shes what a gold digger
isnt it obvious
jealousy is so unattractive
second only to unbridled narcissistic conceit
whining why cant you be nice to me
youve got enough people kissing your ass
ginger returns with a rose
here you go cutie patootie
rich guys always wear flowers
julie gives ted a look
see what i mean
jay leno seems charmed
ted behaves as if he does this every day
the rose from ginger is pinned to his lapel
how are the hometown folks treating you back in xenia
theyve been exceptionally supportive
are they hitting you up for donations
asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee
im no stranger to the notion of philanthropy
andrew carnegie has long been one of my idols
what about the future
you planning to rock the boat at all
stir things up in heaven
teds so smooth
we know its still him under all that armani but it sure does make him look different
matter of fact jay my uncle and i are planning to rethink the magazine
to expand the traditional western notions of beauty
i see so youd be open to little ladies from pasadena who want to show you their knickers
matter of fact jay im planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown the girls of xenia
just to show my appreciation
julie looks thoroughly disgusted
the girls of xenia
now youre talking
what did andrew carnegie ever do
open a couple of libraries
a cocker spaniel poochie sits under a breakfast table holding a newspaper in his snout
wheres my poochie
where is she
merkin dressed in a bathrobe and curlers prepares breakfast
their beautiful college aged daughter judy eats cereal at the table while flipping through a glamour magazine
principal merkin enters
ready for work
wife and daughter dont even look up
is my poochie in here
principal merkin pretends to look for the dog in the cupboard
this is obviously a daily ritual
is she in here
where on earth could she be
he looks under the table
theres my poochie
theres my girl
the dog leaps into his arms
principal merkin grabs the paper as poochie starts to lick his face
poochie loves daddy doesnt she
breakfast is getting cold
thank you dear
no dogs at the table
i know dear
principal merkin places the dog on the ground takes a seat and bites into a breakfast sausage
he opens the paper and is confronted by a full page ad
girls of xenia go straight to heaven
how when where to apply
who chokes on his sausage
clutches his throat
signaling to his wife and daughter
judy looks up grossed out
merkin attempts the heimlich maneuver
principal merkin turns red blue purple
finally the piece of sausage flies out of his mouth past judy
poochie catches it in mid flight
weakly thatta girl
principal merkin drives to work humming along to liza minellis new york new york
the song comes to an end and a radio spot begins
how many times have people told you jeepers you look swell naked
well nows your chance to go straight to heaven
principal merkin tries to change the station
but the ad seems to be on every station
come on down for the girls of xenia pictorial
lets show the nation our cows arent the only ones with great udders
students hover at the bulletin board reading a poster advertising the heaven auditions
principal merkin pushes through the crowd and tears the poster off the board
hundreds of xenia citizens have gathered for this meeting
principal merkin stands in front of the five members of the city council who sit at a u shaped table
he holds up heaven magazine
preaching with an evangelical passion
this my friends this is not heaven
this flesh rag is a one way ticket to hell
we must voice our outrage
to remain passive in the eye of the devil is like inviting him to a pot luck in your own backyard and asking him to bring the three bean salad
his supporters murmur agreement
for the sake of this community and its impressionable young minds i propose this publication be banned from our city
his posse of supporters applaud
his opponents groan
ted slouches nearby
a lawyer next to him
the mayor bangs the gavel and the commotion settles
thank you for that long winded but impassioned speech mr
i hope you can cut to the chase ted
principal merkin takes his seat
playing the big shot lawyer
julie sits in the crowd taking notes
with all due respect to merk he doesnt have to read my magazine
but he has no right to stop others
to principal merkin ever hear of the first amendment
rising an outburst we cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community
if that were true this would be one seriously constipated town
most guys in xenia have been looking at naked girls in heaven since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it under the mattress
a bit of an uproar from the crowd
women eye their husbands suspiciously
julie makes a point
isnt it true principal merkin that you only care now because heaven is suddenly too close to home
indeed it is miss conroy
i make no bones about it
heaven has gone too far
needleman another angry man from principal merkins posse jumps on the bandwagon
principal merkin is right
we cant let heaven violate our own daughters wives sisters mothers girlfriends aunts
helen motions to ted
he quickly locates a page in the report she prepared for him
he handles this like a pro
i wouldnt want to name names mr
needleman or cause any undue embarrassment
but many members of this community have been loyal heaven readers for the better part of the last two decades
not to mention certain charter subscribers who have developed a voracious appetite for our video library as well
i dont suppose courtney leaves the convent rings a bell to anyone
needleman dissolves into his seat
half the men in the audience seem to evaporate
nelson you are beelzebubs henchman
you are single handedly destroying the integrity of our community and i will not have it
ill gather signatures
ill petition the courts
sheepishly you do what you have to do dick
but if theres a man among us who doesnt like to steal a look at some pretty titty once in a while let him cast the first stone
the room is suddenly silent
principal merkin gives the mayor a hard look
merkins face contorts in slow mo as he proclaims
holding a stack of flyers charlie chats with judy merkins college aged daughter
youre like a centerfold waiting to happen
and let me assure you i have some serious pull with the publisher
judy smiles fetchingly
stashing charlies heaven flyer in her backpack
her father suddenly appears
what the hell are you doing
im an adult
i can do whatever i want
my roof my rules young lady
he grabs her arm while knocking the stack of flyers out of charlies hands
as principal merkin drags her away judy smiles back at charlie
send us a picture sugar
well get back to you
the stack of flyers floats over the railing and onto the ground floor just as a group of lovely young women enters the building lobby
they excitedly reach for the flyers
a line of beautiful women all shapes and sizes snakes around the block and into a doorway
the women are dressed to impress in very skimpy clothing
ted pulls up in his convertible ferrari
the women shout greetings as ted heads for the door
we follow ted as he dashes up the stairs along the line of women towards an office
greeting the women hello there
charlie looks frazzled
youre late bro
ginger got a little you know enthusiastic
youll never believe whos in there
it better not be my aunt trudy
a young woman sits with her back to the door
sorry to keep you waiting
the woman turns towards ted revealing herself to be christy malone
ted is momentarily stunned
hi teddy bear
you want to be in heaven
i turned eighteen over spring break
ted doesnt know what to say
charlies equally stunned
hell it seems has frozen over
i feel like ive just been hit by a mack truck
with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip
highly modified since the last time we saw it
a large flat screen hangs on the wall
a high tech computer system for video conferences dominates the room
ted speaks with uncle billy and helen
so far so good
some of them have real angel potential
so im doing ok
were impressed but not surprised ted
you have your fathers impeccable judgment
dad passes the partially open door
my father mustve been amazing
he was in a league of his own
suddenly ted feels his dads presence behind him
sorry i its okay
you need me
holding a list your mom said youve been ignoring your chores
ted takes the list
gives it a cursory glance
nods to his dad as if dismissing him
no problem consider it done
to uncle billy i had this idea of shooting on location
outdoors you know
maybe at some famous xenia landmarks
you think that would be a problem
well send you the release forms ted
our staffers will help in any way they can
youre the titan of tushies the general of jism
dont you forget it ted baby
completely ignoring his dad
who backs out of the room
mom drives up to the house
she stares aghast
there are tall beautiful angels everywhere
one cuts the grass
another pulls weeds
two others on the roof cleaning gutters
still others wash the car
with jimmy handling the water hose
drenching the women more than the car
shrieks and giggles all around
teds dad guiltily enjoys the view but quickly rushes to his wife
she gets out of her car and steadies herself on his arm
ted stands on an ottoman as a tailor fits him for a prom tuxedo
he towers over his parents who try to talk to him
we feel for them
theyve lost control of their kid
you have to understand
this was a big shock for all of us
one minute youre our little boy of whom we could not be more proud
the next minute youre the owner of this whole pornographic empire
but that doesnt make you the boss of everything son
dont you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family
ted looks down at them literally
i paid off the mortgage
i ordered that winnebago you always wanted
now youre ashamed of me
you ordered a winnebago
mom gives dad a look
stick to the script
dont be swayed by presents
were not ashamed of you teddy
we dont approve of the magazine or the models or the so called flesh parties you attend
but we can get past all that
we miss you
we miss our son
we miss our family
i promised id finish high school and thats what im doing
what more do you want from me
dad glances at mom hesitant
she nods giving him the courage to continue
we think you should give up the magazine
let someone else run it
whatever it takes
we want you to go to college find a career you love marry a nice girl from a nice family and live happily ever after
that is your dream not mine
my dream is so far beyond anything you people could even imagine
watch your tone mister
why dont you just admit what this is really all about
im not your real kid and you cant control me anymore
mom and dad look stricken
ted doesnt know when to stop
no wonder i was so bored
no wonder i hated this one horse cow town
i come from talented people who took chances and dared to imagine a life without limits
i was never meant to be raised by
ted storms away unintentionally crashing into a treasured family photo on the end table
the frame shatters into smithereens
breaking mom and dads hearts
stunned silence hangs heavy in the room
couples slow dance to a marilyn manson clone singing a rock version of precious and few
principal merkin watches on the sidelines
ted caresses gingers bare back as they dance together
his head nestled against her breasts
not a care in the world
he spots charlie on the dance floor
making out with one of his dates the identical taylor triplets while the other two patiently wait their turn
i was thinking
maybe we could go away together
whatever you want
we notice christy malone dancing with her football captain date
the perfect male specimen
christy gives ted a disappointed longing gaze
but hes oblivious
i bet st
tropez in july would be paradise
for a honeymoon
suddenly a flash blinds them
its julie conroy doing her job
following her subject
snapping you could have warned us
warning youve got lipstick on your teeth
julie flashes the camera again
capturing gingers panicked expression
we notice that julie looks alluring in a deep purple strapless gown
not so glamorous as ginger but far more appealing and natural
you clean up nice
put your eyeballs back in your head william randolph
im on assignment
a girl has to fit in
ginger seems testy and jealous
her true colors emerging
teddy i thought we were having a moment here
of course we were
suddenly the music dies
everyone turns to the stage where principal merkin stands proudly
holding a power cord
i apologize for interrupting the festivities but i have some good news
ive been reviewing the rules and regulations set forth by the superintendent of schools
and it seems quite clear
reading from manual minors may not be accompanied to school functions by adults unless they are their parents or legal guardians
a spotlight suddenly finds ted and charlies beautiful dates
so long ladies
the crowd boos hisses
its like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire
rules are rules
come on its our only senior prom
deaf ears mr
i answer to a higher power
charlie steps in like a hostage negotiator
heres the deal merk
forget the rules and regulations malarkey and well give you seven minutes in heaven with the taylor triplets
ted realizes his high school reputation is at stake
he steps up on stage
approaches principal merkin
takes out his wallet
whats your price merk
how much will it cost to make you go bye bye
the crowd cheers
youre crossing the line mr
a statue in front of city hall dedicated to principal dick merkin
im warning you
a new pediatric wing at the hospital
a presidential campaign
principal merkin trembles from the sheer temptation of it
yet he could never succumb in front of so many witnesses
he has to maintain his dignity
youre out of here
from nowhere a flock of beefy security guards emerge to remove ted co
good bye mr
have a pleasant evening
the marilyn manson clone is rapidly whisked away and replaced by six geezers in powder blue tuxedoes
as security guards carry them away
restrained what do you want me to do
this is humiliating
were being ejected from a prom
hang in there ill think of something
as they reach the doors
i dont know
i guess we should leave if were not wanted
i hear you bro
were angus men in a ground round town
this is what i get for playing den mother in romper room
take me to the airport charlie
why dont you just hitch a ride on the horse you rode in on
ginger storms away in an angry huff
calling after her dont forget your broom
ted experiences a moment of loss
i thought i loved her
chicks are like buses
if you miss one dont sweat it
theres another coming round the corner
one of the taylor triplets bats her lashes at ted
whispering to ted take your pick
ted grins broadly
he turns and shouts to his classmates
everybody listen up
this prom sucks
lets party at my place
responses are mixed
some cheer some are undecided
until the new band starts playing tie a yellow ribbon round the old oak tree
and everyone rushes for the exit following ted
a muzak version of tie a yellow ribbon round the old oak tree continues
a pizza delivery guy watches the numbers rise to the penthouse
suddenly the doors open to reveal
all four penthouse suites have been rented by ted
its party central
quickly growing out of control
kids dance play drinking games spin the bottle and generally trash the place
the pizza delivery guy wheels a dolly with a huge stack of pizzas into the party only to be attacked by the prom goers like starving beasts
grabbing the pizzas
devouring them hungrily
ted charlie the taylor triplets and several buddies lounge around drunkenly watching the home shopping channel on teds big screen tv
a tacky ceramic gnome rotates on the screen
ted swigs dom perignon straight from the bottle
he shouts orders into his cell phone
hell yes all hundred and seventeen of em
no leave one
somebodys grandmother might want one
and while youre at it ill take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads
i love those springy head puppies
ted looks up as the elevator doors open
principal merkin has arrived
ted confronts him
you kicked us off your turf merk
dont rain on our parade
nelson you disappoint me
first you break our school board rules
then you break the law
what law merk
letting down our hair on prom night
our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking
you called the cops on us
alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind
suddenly the whole xenia police force appears in full riot gear
the partys over
everyone runs for the stairs
ted gives principal merkin a spiteful look and joins the mass exodus
drunken teenagers pour out of the building
dashing for their cars and limos
teds among them
suddenly hes cut off by a harley that stops right in front of him
still in her purple strapless prom dress
with a black motorcycle jacket over it
need a lift
ted jumps on wrapping his arms around her waist
julie takes off
julie maneuvers the nighttime streets of xenia taking off down a country road
where are we going
to the best hiding place in the world
now we understand
julies family comes from major bucks
the yard is massive
and resting in a sprawling oak tree is the best hiding place in the world
a cozy oasis
a whole series of flashlights hang upside down like lanterns
giving the tree house a warm glow
i cant believe your dad built this for you
he had it built
its two different things
he cared enough to want you to have it
he phoned it in
i doubt it
now it makes sense the whole neo bohemian down with hypocrisy fight the power crap
youre a poor little rich girl
the ozone must be fully depleted on planet ted
you think my dad would have been like that if i knew him
you think he would have bought me a stadium instead of teaching me how to play ball
your dad taught you everything
i mean my father
a father is nothing but sperm ted
it takes a real man to be a dad
its all so complicated
its incredibly simple
i feel like im being drawn and quartered
like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction
eventually youll let go
and then what
then youll see whos really holding on to you
even when you infuriate me i still want to kiss you
but you never do
if we were a team we could do anything
i mean anything
julies eyes narrow
she should have known
cut to the chase william randolph
your audience is way ahead of you
in a word merk
thats two words
and im out of the exposed business remember
i need to graduate
besides merks a boy scout
theres gotta be something
we have to dig deeper
you forget i dislike you at least as much as him
he shut down your paper
youre stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and pta brunches
hes right but
a good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade
im honing my craft
then you wont mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week
dressed in a old fashioned barber costume complete with a handle bar mustache principal merkin sings as part of a barber shop quartet
the senior citizens clap enthusiastically
ted and julie peek through a crack in the doorway
disappointment on their faces
principal merkin pours soup into the bowl of a shabbily dressed homeless man
julie shoots ted an i told you so look
principal merkin supervises a crew of kindergarten children cleaning up the roadside litter
julie and ted watch from
see what i mean
hes squeaky clean
he makes gandhi look like a war monger
ted steels himself
somehow theyll get him
in the golden light of sunset molly a stunning xenia girl stands on the stairs that curve up around a huge water tower that overlooks the city
her loose spring dress billows in the wind
held on by only one button
exposing in quick glimpses that she isnt wearing a bra
an assistant holds a portable strobe attached to a reflector
charlie shoots with his nikon
motor drive whirling
i have a great idea
lets lose the last button
we hear a round of oohs from below
ted glances down where
hundreds of binoculars cameras and camcorders are poised on the scene
men of all ages are milling around gawking focusing their long lenses
women are conspicuously absent
except for the gaggle of hardcore feminists with their placards denouncing heaven
one feminist approaches the mayor
the city tower belongs to the city not to some pornographer
the library also belongs to the city
and guess what
its going to have a new ted nelson wing with three thousand childrens books
the feminist tries to respond but a helicopter swoops overhead drowning out her words
the helicopter rises to the level of the photo shoot where the door slides open
and just when we think it must have been hired by some hard core fans who wanted a closer look we find principal merkin frowning as he barks through a
you should be ashamed young lady
your body is a sacred temple
molly flashes him
principal merkin averts his eyes
missing the sight of mollys dress being blown off her body by the choppers prop wash
the spectators below applaud
they watch in amazement as her dress floats down to them
young lady i will pray for gods mercy upon your soul
dont bother merk
im already going to heaven
to charlie get them together
eyes lighting up brilliant
molly give me all youve got
molly gets the idea
she poses provocatively towards principal merkin who suddenly realizes hes in a compromising position
stop that stop that this instant
but molly pulls off her panties and flings them at him
uncle billy chortles his image glowing on a large flat screen monitor that hangs on the wall
ted leans back in his chair
i never saw anybody turn so many shades of red
i cant wait to see the pictures
it was incredible
the light the crowd everything
uncle billy grins proudly at ted
have i told you lately how proud i am of you
im doing all right
youre taking this bull of an empire by the horns but youre still keeping your small town values
youre not letting all this stuff spoil you
ted knows its not true
he looks guilty
i owe it all to you
without your help id be lost
i wish i knew you years ago when my brother was alive
i wish he never gave you up
yeah well like my grandpa used to say
you cant change your christmas past but you sure can exchange your christmas presents
uncle billy forces a laugh
why dont you come to town this weekend
we could play some golf chase some skirts
ted smiles at the appealing offer
id love to but i really need to crack the books
final exams are coming up and ive been slacking
i should work too
our first issue together is almost ready to print
thanks uncle billy
thanks for everything
youre a great kid
dont you forget it
with that hes gone
the room is completely silent
and ted is completely alone
until the doorbell chimes
ted opens the door
its jimmy with his shiny new bike
james what are you doing here
you can call me jimmy again
sheryl petersen said james sounds too pretentious
sheryl petersen is what nine years old what does she know
she knew exactly where you were staying which you neglected to tell me your own brother
its really late
do your parents know where you are
mom and dad think im tucked safely in bed and thats all they need to know
will this discussion be continuing in the hallway or somewhere slightly more inviting
jimmy seems impressed by the opulence
he takes off his bike helmet looks around
this is bigger than our whole house
most places are jimmy
they say money cant buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile
so what brings you here at his hour
my new bike
i came to ask permission to take custody of your room
better view more spacious new carpet
its a no brainer
its not up to me
mom and dad said its yours
they seem to think youre coming home
you can have it then
im not going back there
jimmy whips out a piece of paper from his pocket
if you could just sign right there
you want it in writing
just a formality
jimmy squirrels away the paper excitedly
starts to zip up his wind breaker
i mean you dont want to order room service or anything
we could play games and watch movies and stuff
are you kidding
mom and dad discover im gone and ill be doing hard time
are they okay
aside from the fact that moms eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isnt broken things
couldnt be better
i miss them too
you cant come back
that is you can but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine
youre a peach
funny you should say that
my grandfather was a peach farmer
for the first time that really smarts
he was my grandfather too
i meant biologically
thats a crappy thing to say
im cool with everything
youve long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town
youve always had an itch for the good life
im happy for you
this couldnt happen to a nicer guy
but just for the record my mom is a kick ass schoolteacher and my dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the himalayas
you seem to have forgotten they opened nelsons family market so they could build something permanent a legacy for us
i didnt forget
you ever look down on them again and call them grocers like its a dirty word and youll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight
talk about tough love
loud and clear
suddenly the phone rings
ted sheepishly explains
thats probably my office
where the hell are you
hes on the move
i got an anonymous tip and an address in cincinnati
lets do it
ted hangs up the phone
but his shiny new bike is left behind
not much of a place
a middle aged torch singer croons my romance
ted and julie find their way to corner table
keeping an eye out for principal merkin
i dont know
this place seems pretty tame
you expected whips chains merk being cattle prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood
at least its not another h meeting or a big brother barbecue
amen to that
their heads are very close together
a conspiratorial tete a tete
look at us
its one oclock in the morning on a school night
were in a smoky nightclub hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart
im trembling with excitement
that has more to do with your proximity to me
playing along my desire betrays me like goosebumps on my flesh
i have a bit of a goosebump fetish
not many people know that
i figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy
shoes if you want to know the truth
shoes are my thing
or humping them
my fantasy is a totally naked woman wearing nothing but a timex and suede clogs
thats refreshingly deviant
what about you
im very aural
tell me more
sounds voices music humming
all of it can turn me on or off like a switch
feigning a deep voice i see
i had a portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me
jealous a portuguese boyfriend
sounds very cosmo
you live and learn
i realized the most important thing to me above all is trust
turned out to be a scoundrel eh
i saw that one coming
you lose trust in someone and its over done gone forever
at that moment the torch singer begins crooning people
do you trust me julie
not a chance
trust is something you earn over time
you dont just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire
ted leans even closer
looking into her eyes
using his voice
being as aurally seductive as he can
i want you to trust me
julie ill tell you something that is the gods honest truth
ive seen a lot of really beautiful girls
i mean a lot
but none of them make me feel like you do
thats hard to believe
but absolutely true
ted moves closer
julie doesnt move away
the singer seems to be performing just for them
a feeling deep in your soul says you were half now youre whole
just as ted and julie are about to kiss julies eyes widen
she grabs teds hand
simultaneously they turn towards the its the mother lode
thats not just any middle aged torch singer
thats principal merkin
dressed in drag as barbra streisand
and doing a mighty fine job of it
ted pulls out his camera and fires away
blinded by the stage lights principal merkin sings and vogues glamorously
he has no idea his secret is out
ted and julie rush down the street in the rain giggling totally euphoric
they stop to catch their breath
their clothes are drenched but they couldnt care less
in no time theyve got their arms wrapped around one another kissing and laughing
we just found the ultimate centerfold for the girls of xenia
suddenly julie sobers pulls away
i have to be honest with you ted
i really despise the girls of xenia
i know their small town mentality can be maddening
i mean your pictorial
it bothers me profoundly
aw julie its my job
its like being a doctor
julie eyes him skeptically
youre telling me you dont get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts
youve seen one naked breast youve seem them all
which explains the continued success of heaven for how many decades
i like that
you think youre working with chimps here
the thing is i made a commitment
i said id do it and i have to keep my word
keeping your word is something i can actually respect ted
ted closes the back of his camera
takes a deep breath
and forces a confident smile
he then peers into the
where christy malone limbers up
stretching her leg against the wall
wearing her sexy cheerleader uniform
i thought id be nervous but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed teddy bear
i mean yeah i do
i have to admit i am so totally turned on
we should do it
take the pictures
christy does her warm up contortionist poses for ted
clothes still on
as reflectors bounce strobes into the shower area
years of being a merciless tease paying off right here and now
christy knows how to make love to the camera
i remember the first time you walked into mrs
temples class in nd grade
blue gingham dress
which you pulled hard
that was code for i like you
wanna unzip me
ted slowly unzips christys top catching a glimpse of her long sensuous back
she resumes posing
flashing a bare shoulder
a coy look
she doesnt need direction
shes a natural
remember dress up day
you and charlie lifting skirts during recess
i miss those days when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence
now im taking off my clothes
all by myself
christy slips off her cheerleader top
lowers her skirt
flings it aside
shes wearing only panties the size of a band aid
ted is mute
staring at her perfect body
you have changed since second grade
i mean what do you think
you expect me to think at a time like this
there isnt a drop of blood in my brain
oh teddy bear youre funny
ted steps out of the shower
out of christys sight he squirms in his jeans
trying to hide his enthusiasm
music suddenly seems to come from nowhere
nine inch nails
i want to fuck you like an animal
sotto god help me
ted steps back into the shower
christy rubs an ice cube on her left nipple
i heard they do this on photo shoots
wanna to do the other one
she tosses him the ice cube
it lands on the floor
youre doing just fine christy
then im ready when you are
ted looks through the lens
we can see him trembling
music blasts as teds camera burns through film
theyre both getting into it
water pulsating over her body
christy begins lathering her breasts
i was always too shy to admit how much i liked you
come on i was hamburger
you were porterhouse
maybe on the outside
but inside deep down ive always been dripping with special sauces
she smiles sexily are you hungry
is he hungry
hes been working up this appetite for ten years
he can barely contain himself
god you are so hot
then you better get in the water before you get burned
ted calls her bluff
he sets aside his camera
walks right into the water
through the steam
she wraps a leg around him sucking face wanting more
you and me finally
this will be so fantastic teddy bear
suddenly ted stops
remembering what julie said about trust
im sorry christy
ive been crazy about you forever and this is definitely a page right out of my palm pilot but i just cant go through with it
he turns away but christy presses her bare body against his back
wrapping her hands around his waist
caressing his chest his stomach
sure you can
youre only human
its not like youre made of steel
she lowers her hand or are you
ted and christy locked in a steamy embrace
rolling on the floor
hands arms lips tongues all in motion
as the shower drenches them
suddenly they roll into a pair of legs
both look up
the steam clears to reveal julie
hurt but not surprised
whats up doc
she doesnt wait for an explanation
christy covers herself
ted chases after julie
wait julie wait
julie dashes out of the girls locker room passing a janitor
ted follows dripping water
im sorry mr
she pushed right past me
calling after julie at least let me explain
julie darts into the girls restroom
ted stops at the door
then realizes there is no one else around
he heads inside
julies too proud to let him see her cry
but we can tell shes upset
go away ted
ted corners her near a row of sinks
please believe me
it was just a kiss for old times sake
ive had a stupid crush on her since i was seven but i never got closer to her than four feet and then there she was right in front of
me completely naked
julie looks at him pensively
she unzips the back of her summery dress
and lets it fall to the floor
shes completely naked and absolutely gorgeous
hes been around dozens of naked women by now but this one he cant just gawk at
this one he really cares about
being naked is no big deal
it has nothing to do with emotion nothing to do with love
you can be around all the naked girls you want and you wont be even one step closer to anything meaningful in your life
she puts on her dress gracefully
as if nothing happened
you dont know me even one ounce better than you did before
you and your stupid magazine
i liked you better when you were sweet and kind and human like the rest of us
at that moment teds cell phone rings
julie walks away leaving ted completely alone
he answers lifelessly
weve got a huge problem with the magazine ted baby
our readers hate it
we need to talk
ted walks down the hallway
three jocks look through the new issue of heaven
they taunt ted
you got a great sense of humor
i love the three hundred pound eskimo chick
you like eskimo pie teddy
i like the african chick with the big lip
you could stash a lot of weed in there
maybe even a six pack
teds mortified depressed
charlie appears next to him with heaven in hand
holy stinkers what were you thinking
we wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty
we wanted to showcase women throughout the world
next time make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold
principal merkin approaches
also holding heaven in his hand
ted i realize i owe you an apology
youre destroying heaven much faster from the inside than i ever could from the outside
good job son
ted could not feel worse
ted uncle billy and helen
meeting with the heads of our advertisers are wigging out
half of them are threatening to pull their ads for next month
the other half already did
it was nothing more than beginners folly
tell everyone to lighten up
its a little more serious than that bill
the stockholders have requested a meeting
they want our guarantee that this will never happen again
the words pain her some of them are even calling for teds resignation
look the girls of xenia are gorgeous youll see
next month well be back to normal
another disaster like this could sink us
weve got thousands of subscribers requesting refunds
the kid came up with something that sounded good on paper
who knew our readers wouldnt dig it
the kid came up with something
we tried to warn you
sometimes young people need to make their own mistakes
thats how they learn
ted can see that uncle billys playing this out differently than he imagined
giving ted all the credit
firmly to uncle billy it wont happen again
it will never happen again
ted sits at his fathers desk
going through paperwork
in the b
he hears the playful sounds of women
which distract him
ted approaches the window and watches a group of girls splashing and playing in the pool
he looks sad
helen enters behind him
he turns to her
i always thought i wanted fame and fortune and beautiful women
but sometimes your dreams come true and they cause you nothing but grief
i just want to chuck everything and sell the stupid magazine
its not worth the pain
helen takes teds hand comfortingly
come let me show you something
helen and ted sit on old trunk
helen holds a scrapbook in her arms
explaining to ted
your parents never wanted to interfere with your life ted
they knew your mom and dad loved you very much
they knew they did the right thing
but that doesnt mean they didnt watch you and miss you from afar
you mean they knew who i was
they kept this scrapbook of your life
it meant the world to them
we see baby pictures of ted taken through the glass of a nursery
a newspaper photo of ted playing a donkey in a nativity play
and clippings from teds high school newspaper
i wondered about them for so many years
i wondered if i looked like them acted like them
i wondered why they gave me up
giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did
when they founded heaven they wished they could take you back but it was too late
all they could do was build the empire knowing that someday it would all be yours
your parents would be crushed to think you werent happy with it
theyre not my parents helen
my parents are back in xenia and i hurt them very much
and the girl i love she hates heaven
if i keep it shell never respect me
but how can you respect yourself if you dont
teds parents and jimmy walk through the front door
theyre stunned to find a huge x enlarged family portrait hanging over the mantle
its the same picture ted broke in his childish tantrum
mom and dad are moved
even more so when they see ted
waiting for them on the couch
everything i am is because of you
can you ever forgive me
hugging him oh teddy
we missed you so much
you were always our number one son
rolling his eyes mom dad
this display of unconditional love is appalling
we are a family
a family need i remind you that he ridiculed and left for dead
shut your pie hole jimmy
i will not have my boys arguing
so when im seventeen can i turn everyones life upside down behave like a total piece of canine excrement and then wipe the slate clean with a half baked apology
and a kodak moment
which is precisely why i got the rights to my new room in writing
to his parents i need your help
im really in deep shit
dont say shit honey
use the strong vocabulary god gave you
besides theres no problem too deep or too shitty for us to solve
dad reaches for a can of peaches from the shelf
son its a simple fix
the only difference between my store and that magazine of yours is a bunch of zeros
now have i ever told you the story about the can of peaches
a heaven stockholders meeting in progress
uncle billy stands at the podium
heaven has gone to hell
behind him are charts wall graphs
we quickly realize he is a complete and utter turn coat
i loved my brother
i stood by his wishes to let his son run the company
a son he never knew
a son that he and his wife gave away at birth
a son who was raised in a world quite different from our own
nevertheless i was there for the lad
i guided him as best i could
but hes only seventeen with a mind of his own and judgment that is well frankly not a chip off the old block
there is only one clear solution
gesturing to himself and i think we all know what that is ted bursts into the meeting with his dad
holding up a can of peaches
suddenly hundreds of eyes are upon him
ted dashes to the podium with passion in his soul and fire in his belly
what are you doing
back off benedict
uncle billy steps into the shadows as ted looks out at the crowd
but he takes a deep breath and finds the courage to explain
the only man i called dad owns a little grocery store in xenia ohio
he learned a lot of cool stuff from my grandpa who was a peach farmer in his day
grandpa knew the right thing to say in every situation and it usually involved peaches
my dads a lot like him
and he taught me you have to focus on the peachy side of life not the pits
dads eyes are filled with tears
hes never been so proud
there was a time when canned peaches were the hottest greatest thing ever invented
it was like a little taste of summer anytime you wanted
grocery stores couldnt keep them in stock they were so popular
and even though other canned fruits like pears plums and pineapples have come along people still need to know they can get their canned peaches on the same shelf whenever
they want them
its comforting you know
it fulfills their expectations
the stockholders are listening
uncle billy grins nervously
unable to believe ted is pulling this off
youre probably wondering if theres a point to all this and i guess its just that i goofed last month
i not only moved the canned peaches i restocked the shelves with kiwi guava and mandarin oranges in heavy syrup
i challenged peoples expectations
and you cant do that to your customers
so i ask you for one more chance to fix things and give our readers back their canned peaches
the stockholders applaud enthusiastically giving ted a standing ovation
ted turns to uncle billy
thanks for teaching me an important lesson
what makes a family is love not blood
all is fair in heaven ted baby
and guess whos the new king of the unemployment line
aw come on kid
throw me a bone
im your uncle for gosh sakes
ted looks at pictures
listens to his staff
he seems confident
mature beyond his years
the magazine goes to press
in voice over we hear julie reading the article about ted that she wrote for the school paper
its easy to fall prey to petty jealousy when considering the young life of ted nelson
but how would any of us behave if one day all our dreams came true
would we handle it half as well
would we find ourselves making the same mistakes for which we criticize him
someone hands ted a copy of julies article
he reads the last portion of it aloud
one can only hope that ted nelson will find bigger and better dreams upon which to set his sights as the years pass
and that he will remember always where he came from
julie opens her front door
he hands her a copy of heaven
intrigued she turns to the page
we see a special dedication to julie my partner in crime with all the love in the world
julies eyes fill with tears
she flips ahead to the girls of xenia pictorial only to find principal merkin
singing his heart out in drag as barbra streisand
its a series of shots from the cincinnati nightclub
other shots suggestively include him with molly in the foreground as if they posed together
not bad for a hack
he has a future in yellow journalism
he kicked major ass and you know it
principal merkin drives
the radio plays in the b
as one song ends we hear the dj say
this ones for you dick merkin of tecumseh high
from all your students
with hugs and kisses
the voice of barbra streisand fills the car
people people who need people are the luckiest people in the world
principal merkin pales
he turns off the radio
but somehow he can still hear the song
as he pulls into the school parking lot students wave enthusiastically
he waves back tentatively
principal merkin swings open his car door to be greeted by the sound of barbra singing her heart out through the parking lot
every students car stereo blasts the song
chanting bar bra bar bra bar bra
principal merkin turns crimson
graduation caps fall all around
people hugging laughing overjoyed
ted searches for julie but shes nowhere in sight
a big graduation party in progress
but ted sits in the corner looking sad dejected
julie didnt show up
he blew it
jimmy and charlie approach with cheering on their minds
why so melancholy
you were born naked wet and hungry
now youre hip handsome and rich
you are the coxswain on the ship of life
eat drink and screw mary
proudly i taught him that
from my wise albeit youthful vantage point the world is your oyster
you scored big
you got everything you ever wanted
except the girl
the only one that really mattered
and who might that be
ted turns to find julie
his faces brightens with hope
i was afraid you left
i was afraid id never see you again
im not going anywhere ted
youre the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams
i decided to let helen run the magazine
i need to go to college learn a few things you know
julie seems pleased
and i thought maybe id take up boating
ive always wanted to be a coxswain
i like that
the thing is ill need a first mate
i know where you can find any number of naked girls whod love to hop on board
all kidding aside he speaks from the heart
julie you were right
all the naked girls in the world mean nothing
its the one you want to cover up with your coat that you really love
five years from now
i graduated from college
did great summa cum laude and all
and im about to launch a brand new magazine called exposed
an homage to miss julie conroy of xenia ohio
i know where you can find an excellent editor in chief
let your fingers do the walking
suddenly the music changes
theyre playing our song
extending his hand dare i ask for this dance
taking his hand you better
ted and julie begin dancing and kissing in the b
charlie and jimmy feign tears
im a sucker for a happy ending
hugging jimmy hold me
and we start to rise again above the nelson house into the clouds above xenia
so as you can guess everybody pretty much lived happily ever after
my parents didnt give up the grocery store
we descend through clouds and quickly find were
mom and dad take pictures and smooch in front of the palace
but they did manage to sneak away for a second honeymoon
we zoom close on heaven magazine where pages flip open in the wind revealing
merks appearance in heaven turned out to be a good thing
he was spotted by a talent scout
principal merkin dressed as barbra singing dont rain on my parade
and went on a european summer tour fulfilling his lifelong dream
naturally he brought poochie the only girl he ever really loved
poochie the cocker spaniel watches
wagging her tail
after graduation charlie moved to utah
charlie wrestling in a haystack with the identical taylor where he married all three of the identical taylor triplets
lets just say theyve been very busy
peeking out of the haystack we spot at least a dozen charlie jrs
and even uncle billy landed on his feet
uncle billy wears a phone headset
he seems to be swimming in a sea of time life style operators
with a two year subscription to heaven you get a free underwater calculator
and now if youll excuse me i think ill get back to being the coxswain on the ship of life
ted and julie sail off into what else but a glorious sunset
