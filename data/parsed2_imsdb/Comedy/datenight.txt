written by josh klausner june a modest city bedroom
suitcases and half unpacked boxes sit on one side of the room
sc orles moving in
in his bathrobe phil foster a good looking guy in his mid s hums to himself as he looks through stacks of wedding pictures organized all over the bed
just as he finishes up a pile and starts another beautiful clara foster in a bathrobe too jumps across his lap
you were the one who told me not to mess up the precious picture piles
he gives him a long slow kiss
that was nice
it was nice
hey from now on when you change the toilet paper could you just make sure it is out
she moves in and the honeymoons over
oh believe me were just getting started phil
reaches into picture pile look at this one of your mom with me
i mean that woman cant contain her love
on the wedding picture ruth claras mother stands stiffly next to phil with an expression like shes ankle deep in a manure bin
she just takes a while to warm up
you guys are gonna be best buddies
you picked a favorite of us yet
phil finds the picture handing it to clara
thats exactly the one i picked
clara leans the photo on the night stand next to the bed
its a portrait of them from their wedding
they look joyous excited
a young couple with the world in front of them
man i wish i was them
phil kisses the back of claras neck but her smile fades as she stares at the picture
when i was growing up my mom and dad had a picture just like this
now they cant even acknowledge each other
phil sympathetically gives her a squeeze
lets always remember to have some time thats just for the two of us
no matter what else comes up in our lives if its work or friends or when we have kids were having kids
with an s
but i promise you its never gonna happen to us
yeah well see if youll be saying that when im long in the tooth
youll be even hotter long toothed
right now to be honest clara theyre a little stumpy
as phil climbs on top and kisses her he reaches over and turns off the light
suddenly we hear the piles of pictures slide off the bed and hit the ground
tell me it wasnt the pictures
wasnt the pictures
you know how long that took
well fix the picture piles clara
weve got all the time in the world
from now on everythings gonna be just about us
suddenly a young voice breaks through the darkness
the talking heads once in a lifetime kicks next to the framed wedding picture of phil and clara an alarm clock on a side table reads am
its seven years later as phil and clara stir
id groan in bed
clara has the comforter wrapped all her while phil lies uncovered next to her in his boxers and a t shirt
without saying a word they rise out of each side of their beds and sleepily march in opposite directions across their suburban bedroom clara down the hall and phil to
im coming ollie
as the talking heads song continues clara makes ollies bed while ollie plays with legos on the floor
phil showered and dressed in a suit walks quickly past the doorway carrying a briefcase his eyes glued to a stack of papers in his hand
phil doubles back still looking at the papers
i need to switch
ive got an open house
phil obviously doesnt want to be bothered right now but contains it
as clara walks quickly past him phil claps his hands together
ok so i say today we go for the slacker look cool yet approachable
yeah well mom says that
ollie points to a preppie outfit laid out on a chair
thats cool too
the talking heads song continues as clara walks quickly through the bedroom
she lets out a yelp as her shin smashes into phils dresser drawer hes left them open
she kicks them closed and limps to the bathroom then stops in the doorway
water covers the floor
grabbing a towel she tosses it down and shimmies to the mirror
as she picks up her toothbrush she notices its wet as well
she re rolls the toothpaste from the bottom up and starts brushing when she sees the sink a jackson pollock of razor hairs and bits of toothpaste
disgusted clara reaches for the kleenex box only to discover its empty
she tosses the box in the trash and shimmies on the towel to get some toilet paper
seeing the roll she sighs as she takes it out of the holder turns it around and puts it back so it rolls out
as the credits end the talking heads song fad phil pen in hand is focused again on his papers as ollie now in the preppie outfit watches him and waits
at the table
phil finally notices
your dads a boob today
whats it gonna be
ollie peers down the hallway to see if theres any sign of his tom
some captain crunch
phil gets an idea and writes zickly
phil grabs the captain crunch cereal box out cupboard and starts toward the table when clara dressed in a suit comes into the room and spots it
ah ah ah
whats that ollie
you had a bowl yesterday
but dad already said yeah sure
clara glances at phil
i said it yeah sure
you know its only one bowl a week
one bowl a day a week
clara eyebrows raised eyes the captain crunch already in phils hand
phil shakes the carton at ollie
this is not for you today
worth a try
did you get his lunch together
you just get his breakfast and ill do it
as phil takes out some special k and pours milk for ollie and a glass for himself he finishes the carton
peeking back over his shoulder he sees claras dialing with the phone to her ear as she readies ollies lunch
he stealthily pours the tiniest bit of milk back quickly returning the carton to the fridge
im getting a late start but ill be there as soon as i can
sorry i dropped the ball
its this quarterly report to mr
you know how he freaks me out with all of his mixed animal metaphors that i dont focusing on ollies lunch ollie do you want a banana
did you hear me
not looking at him uh huh
he freaks you out with his mixed animal metaphors that you dont understand
so i should probably get going
with the highway construction it takes forever to get downtown these days
have a good day
phil kisses her on the cheek and clara absently wipes it off
he looks at her strangely
noticing clara quickly kisses phil on the cheek
your mouthy was still ail milky
sorry for the milky mouth
he heads out
with a sigh clara spots phils left his i dirty glass on the counter
she cleans it in the sink then gets the carton out of the fridge to put some milk in her own coffee
a dribble comes out
shaking her head she tosses the carton in the trash
as phil exits the front door and heads to the carport next to the house his overly cheery neighbor chaz picks a newspaper off his lawn
were up bright and early arent we
yes we are
under his breath ike you say to me every morning
reaching the carport phil scoots between his car and claras
he tries to open his drivers door but clara car is parked too close and the door only opens a few inches
he tries to sql z in but ends up getting stuck halfway
dislodging himself phil sidesteps between the cars and peers around the other side of claras
tons of room
shaking his head phil crosses to his cars passenger side
open house banners piled in the garage block the front passenger door
frustrated phil hops in the rear and grunts as he climbs diagonally over to the drivers seat
the eisenhower highway is a parking lot as road construction blocks out of lanes
in the middle of it phil checks his watch frustrated
peering out his window he looks at a billboard of a smiling older man in slick suit and construction hat
the sign reads mayor highway to the future
phil scowls then checks his watch
clara and jane another sharply dressed realtor in her s walk down the street putting up open house arrow signs on the sidewalk
his names juan and hes some kind of spanish i think
he knows all these exclusive underground places downtown
its so exciting
and in bed
i never knew i could still get my leg back that far
too much information jane
clara and jane speak loudly to each other as they each move quickly around different parts of the vacant home cleaning and inspecting
the divorce was the best thing that ever happened to me
you know that great nervous feeling in your stomach
where you dont know whats going to happen next
on her way down the hall clara spots a mark up ahead on the wall
she reaches into her large purse and pulls out a mini mister and a rag
with the aim of a sharpshooter she sprays ahead wiping the mark as she passes
with larry i lost that
everything had just become routine you know
janes words hit clara close to home
passing on through the kitchen clara notices that the refrigerator makes a weird loud buzzing noise
but now all of a sudden im alive again
good for you jane
clara takes out her frustration on the ridge kicki the side and silencing it
good for you
clara and jane sit on the floor together prospectuses
theres this g eat restaurant downtown we went to the ot ar night that you guys would love
st amazing view of the city
you guys should check it out on your next date night
focusing on stapling yeah well maybe
we dont really have those that much anymore
t have date nights shrugs you know were pretty tired all the time between work and ollie
and some of the shows on tv these days are really great
they staple in silence for a second
jane and clara look at each other
i know thats really lame
so its phil
no its not phil
its the both of us
i dont know
so why dont you change it
all you have to do is stir things up and have one great sexy exciting night again
tonights no good
seriously think about it
whats really gonna be more important tonight than that
clara takes this in
checking his watch phil shakes his head as he rushes through the large bullpen of the chicago mercantile exchange
in the pits all around him buyers and sellers scream out their orders
in a dark wood office with stuffed ar i l heads lining the walls a young smartly dressed man in his s george quietly goes through a binder with mr
rivers at the older mans desk
as phil bursts in they both look over
im sorry im late
the construction on the highways is insane these days
dont worry about it phil
catch your breath
george gives mr
rivers an ornate pal sy handshake then heads out with the binder nodding at phil
phil nods back warily then takes out his binder ready to launch into his report
listen before we start
ive been thinking
this next quarter we need to venture into open tundra
start really ripping the meat
beat trying to decipher uh
take the fund in a more high risk direction
thats wha i aid
i can work up some higher risk options and come back tomorrow
the thing is phil tomorrow i want george to give me his thoughts on where we need to be hunting too
s nothing personal
so let me get this straight
youre telling me that tomorrow im going to have to interview for the job i already have
i wouldnt put it like that
i just need our pack leader to be more like
like a momma kangaroo
ya get me
not really at all
the blind baby kangaroo opens its mouth and knows its mommas teat is just always there ready to suckle
but at the same time momma kangaroos still a wild dangerous creature
still not totally getting you
ive had a wife and a family
three of them
its hard to stay the fastest cheetah when you need to mind the pack phil
george lives in the city doesnt have a family to worry about
he can rip the meat
i dont need to
i was ripping big bloody hunks of meat and eating them like tartare when george was still
in the jungle
what does that mean
i cant be demoted mr
i just cant
listen nothings set
its just i gotta say that lately your leadership on this has felt a little
thats all you needed to say mr
ill see you tomorrow
determined phil marches out of mr
clara talks on her cellphone as she picks up ollie from school
so its ok if we drop him off at
our reservations at
she passes another mother desperately searching for a kleenex for her boy with snot dripping from his nose
without breaking stride clara reaches into her purse and hands the grateful mother a tissue then takes out a mini bottle of purell and cleans her hands
i really appreciate it
clara turns to see ollies teacher the tight buttoned mrs
cardigan walking toward her in the parking lot
oh thats ollies teacher
ill see you later
clara hangs up her phone and greets mrs
cardigan with a warm smile
ive been meaning to tell you that you can just call me clara mrs
id prefer mrs
can we speak a moment
ollie go to the car
as ollie does clara turns back to mrs
is everything ok
well im afraid not
olivers been antagonizing the girls in the class a great deal lately
especially jenny diggs
why do you think thats happening
im going to leave that to you and your nd to figure out
but beyond that i overall attitude these days is just
his penmanship is sloppy
he lacks motivation and tries to just get by o assignments
you know this is a very competitive school mrs
in my opinion maybe you should consider whether this is really the right environment for him
beat stunned uh
cardigan starts away
clara climbs into the car watching mrs
under her breath wow
what a bitch
did you just call mrs
cardigan a bitch
remembering ollies in the no
yeah you did
i really didnt
clara quickly pulls out
phil squeezes out of his drivers seat with folders full of research
as he walks toward the house he spots the tons of room on the other side of claras car and shakes his head
still carrying his research phil peeks in on ollie who packs a suitcase
finally moving out
i gotta tell you its about time
im going to nanas tonight
on a school night
mom says you guys are going out
phil marches into the bedroom
cl he stops in the doorway as he spots her
made up in an evening dress in front of a full length mirror clara looks stunning as she finishes putting an earring on
clara tns and smiles
i thought i could take you out to celebrate you finally getting that report in
a romantic dinner downtown like the old days and teen
raises er eyebrows ollies going to stay at moms so we have the house all to ourselves
she turns back and continues getting ready
is there any chance we coul take a rain check
a rain check
unfortunately i really need to do a bit of work tonight
i thought all the cramming was for this report today
did something go wrong
nothing like that
i just decided i could play with it a little more
make it a little better
clara takes him in a moment
controlling herself clara starts putting her jewelry back in the case
listen im sorry
you dont need to apologize phil
listen if i had more warning then something else would have come up
you know it
thats the thing phil
we used to do things on the spur of the moment all the time
even after ollie was born
now we never do anything together
they stare at each other then phil breaks listen
any other night
maybe another time
let me just get out of this and call my mom then
as clara heads into the closet phil looks after her feeling terrible
about to leave he notices that around the room claras set up candles in anticipation of their romantic night
he looks down again at the papers in his hand and sucks in conflicted
as clara starts to take her dress off phil scoots past her humming to himself
she looks over to see him choosing a tie and jacket from his side
clara looks him still unsure
that dress really wasnt playing fair clara
with a smile clara watches phil tie his tie
well get a move on girl
she zips her dress back up
ruth claras mother opens her front door and brightens
to clara and ollie hey sweeties
nana rented us a special treat tonight before bed ollie
the wizard of oz
wizard of oz
dont you think thats a little scary for a year old
not looking at him no phil i dont
not so sure about that
what do you think
putting her pressure on yeah clara
what do you think
phils flustered as he and clara head out the door towards phils car
im sorry phil
i just felt like shes doing us a favor tonight
oust as they climb into the car clara stops
you know i should pee before we go
as clara runs back to ruths house phil plops down in the drivers seat
ill just wait in the car as you go back e inside to pee
as the sun sets phil and clara sit in bumper to bumper traffic
it extends for miles toward the center of the city
phil turns on the air conditioner and adjusts the vents
you gotta almost feel sorry for mayor diggs
tries to widen all the highways to get reelected but all everyones going to remember when its time to vote is all this mess
thats why i turned on the air
clara shuts the passenger side vents which causes air to gust out of phils vents into his face
he glances at clara oblivious then reaches over and turns down the air
you know mrs
cardigan told me today that ollies been antagonizing his daughter
how does a five year old antagonize
im sure she wouldnt have mentioned it if it wasnt the mayors daughter
she also went on that ollies penmanships sloppy and hes not motivated enough
trying to make a joke of got all my best traits huh
he looks over to see that clara looks out of the wif n not responding a response in itself
he sucks in
i think hes fine
she actually had the gall to suggest we should think about sending him somewhere else
maybe shes right if the school has that kind of attitude
claras about to object bit stops herself and takes a breath playing affection
ely with the back of phils hair
you know what
all we ever end up talking about is ollie or work
lets just focus on us tonight
im all for tha beat
they sit in silence in the traffic
so what are you thinking about
well i heard this unbelievable story from jane today
she has this old classmate who went into labor with her second child the other day
shes totally healthy and everythings normal with the pregnancy
so she goes into labor and walks into the emergency room and the second the nurses and attendants see her come in they go into a panic and start yelling
advanced maternal age
youve got to be joking me
kid you not
clara looks out the window
the funny thing is shes my age actually
suddenly phils smile fades as he realizes the possible ulterior motive
clara picks up on his change and figures out what hes thinking
a bit flustered she opens her vents again
phil looks over at her
i thought you were cold
i was but then you turned it down and i got hot
but i turned it down because
you see when you open and close your vents it makes my
phil reaches over and turns up the air again
tapping his fingers on the wheel with a sigh he gets fed up suddenly veering the car to the shoulder and speeding toward the exit
what are you doing
im just gonna take a shortcut
phil please dont
you think theyre shortcuts but they always take longer
and were already clara please just trust me ok they zoom ahead for a moment in silence
frustrated clara shuts her vents once again sending a powerful gust of cold air onto phils face
biting his tongue he just leaves it blowing on him as they drive
phil and clara rush off the elevator and enter the signature restaurant on the t flcor of the john hancock center with dramatic s lng views over skyline of downtown
chicago and lake michigan
i promise you it wouldnt have been any faster
will you just tell them were here
im gonna go pee
as clara hurries off phil shaking his head makes his way through the crowds to the supermodel hostess
welcome to the signature room
the name is foster
oh im sorry
we just had give away your table
you gave away our table
were just ten minutes late
actually youre minutes late
but dont you guys have like some kind of grace period or something
have an eight minute grace period
you have an eight minute grace period
how did you come up with an eight minute grace period
i just work here so what if someones minutes late
were allowed to give a two minute grace on the grace
which adds up to ten minutes
were minutes late
thats just one minute later than the grace on the grace
im sorry sir but management specifically said no grace on the grace on the grace
after ten minutes we send a host around calling your name and if theres no answer we give the table away
so how longs the wait for another table
well lets see
phil looks on as the supermodel hostess runs her finger down a long list of write in names
as she turns to the next page
even the bathroom has sweeping views of chicago
as clara leaves a bathroom stall she notices a nervous young woman washing her face over and over
a knock and a slick looking man quickly peeks his head in the womens room
weve gotta leave now
the nervous woman quickly leaves the bathroom with the man
clara looks after them a second then washes her hands
clara finds phil at the bar downing handfuls of peanuts
how lc until they seat us
they gave away our reservation
did you tell them that we hit traffic
they wouldnt care clara
if they call your name at the bar and you dont answer they give your table away
so how about a nut
a young host not the hostess mills around the bar
clara sighs frustrated
i mean did you try something like telling her it was our anniversary or my birthday or slipping her some money oh i see
lying and graft were the answer
clara shakes her head then notices the young host searching for the party and starts focusing on him instead of phil as she thinks
im sure if you had been there instead of peeing again you would have done it better
youre not even listening to me are you
repeats still watching yeah i am
youre sure if i had been there instead of peeing again i would have done it better
clara just because you can repeat the words i say doesnt mean youre sorry
were right here
what are you doing
the young host approaches
gale party of three
the thirds running a little going to start without them
phil shoots clara a look but she ignores it
he falls into line after her as she follows the young host to th restaurant
hields his face as they pass the supermodel hos at the greeting station
the young host leads them secluded table right by the windows the best table handing them menus enjoy your dinner
the young host leaves
was that so hard to do phil
bad to be the gales eh
clara opens her menu as looks nervously around the restaurant
its white truffle season
im totally doing it
we cant do this clara
im taking you out
not the truffles
this is stealing
youre kidding right
were not the gales
you said yourself if you dont answer at the bar they give your table away
well what if they show up now
u get spanked im serious
i dont know
what if they do phil
clara picks up her menu and reads shaking her head
i dont know
you used to be the one who would think up stuff like this all the time
this hits phil
he takes in his wife reading the menu for a beat
you know what
youre absolutely right
clara lowers her menu and they look at each other for what feels like the first time tonight
im sorry mrs
its ok mr
and might i add you look very handsome tonight
youre not looking too shabby yours mrs
they turn surprised to see two burly men in suits at their table
the older of the two politely speaks to them
we need to have a word with you both
whats this about
k you know what this is about
you could please come with us
why cant we talk here
u beat smiles i think it would save everyone a lot of embarrassment
gestures with hand please
the younger burly man comes behind claras chair to pull it out
getting up phil shoots clara an i told you so look as he follows the older burly man through the restaurant toward the kitchen doors the younger burly man walking
behind them with clara
the burly man leads them through the kitchen
a waiter stops surprised
can i help you
older s i ly man nah
were fine a walking to the rear service elevator the older burly man pushes the down button
the elevator opens
wait a minute
where are we going
get in please
the younger burly man coming up behind them crowds them into the elevator
the elevator doors shut and the older burly man pushes the g floor then nods to his partner
they reach in their pockets
listen this is all getting out of hand ok
i admit we maybe did something a teeny bit wrong but suddenly they grab phil and clara putting handkerchiefs over their noses and mouths
phil and clara veil and struggle for a moment then pass out
an ammonia stick waves back and forth under phils nose and he startles awake disoriented to see hes tied to a chair in the middle of a gigantic meat locker
a video camera on a tripod aims at their faces and across the room the younger burly man sorts through items from claras purse and phils wallet scattered all over
what the hell is this
tied in the chair next to him clara jumps as the older burly man waves the stick under her nose
whats going on
i dont know
a voice speaks from a speakerphone on the table the chloroform may make you feel dizzy for a few moments but it will go away
phil takes in whats going on freaked
you can just have all our money ok
whatevers there its yours
were not looking to cause problems or put up any kind fight
well just walk away and not report anything ok
all we want is for you to let us go unharmed
we need to discuss your little stunt tonight first mr
or should we say
what is it harry
harry the younger burly man reads phil and claras ids which hes grabbed off of them
phil and clara foster
thats what this is abo else would it be about mr
this a joke right
some funny little bald guys gonna jump out and scare us and say gotcha
or somethi ok where is he
wheres that guy
you think this is a joke
phil looks at the faces of the two thugs
no ones joking
are you insane
you dont drug people and tie them up for that
this i i just i hope you know this is gonna go way beyond a shitty review in za im seriously pissed off
shadowy figure talks on a phone as he looks at a screen showing phil and clara in chairs
well im a little upset as well mr
it would help me to know why a couple like the two of you would try to pull something like this
phils now getting really annoyed
you must be kidding
like a million people dont do it every single night of the week
this is unbelievable
im just in shock here
harry and frank look at each other puzzled
i enjoy your humor mr
now why dont you start by telling me how you got into the rainbow to set it ud into the rainbow
what the hells that
and then you can tell me where the photos are that you arranged to bring tonight
clara figures out whats happened
wait a minute
i think theres been a really big mistake here
were not the gales
know youre not the gales
they know were not the gales
dont you get it
i think they think were actually the gales who made the reservation tonight
were not those gales
youve got the wrong people
then why were you two at the gales table mr
ok listen what happened is we lost our reservation and when the host came around yelling the gales name and no one answered my wife said that we were them
i swear on my life to you thats what happened
youre saying you just took someone elses reservation you didnt know
thats what you want me to believe
i know that seems really weird
listen i agree thats what i said to her
one problem with your story
when i came over to the table and you guys were all alone you were still calling each other gale
that was just
no you dont understand
well need to move things along frank
with a nod frank reaches into his pockets slowly taking out a gun and a handful of bullets
he loads the gun as phil and clara watch
wait a minute
whats going on
i dont t dont like this
clicking the loaded gun frank and harry both come toward phil and clara
if in ten seconds you dont tell us where the photos are you lose a knee mr
ten more seconds you lose another
then we go to your wife
you cant do this
were not lying
frank clicks the loaded gun at phils knee
dont do it
everyone looks over
but we cant just tell you where they are
we have to take you to them
in the middle of the deserted warehouse district clara and phil exit the meat packing plant behind frank who carries claras purse harry holding a gun as he follows them
as they head toward a towncar frank throws the keys back to harry
you drive with her in front
so whats your plan here
i dont have a plan phil
you dont have a plan
i was just trying to keep our knees for the time being
well if we end up in that car with them were as good as dead
well any time you want to help
whats that supposed to mean
i said quiet
they continue walking toward the iowncar phil thin ing hard
suddenly his expression changes and he star s weaving dizzily putting his hand to his forehead
he drops to the ground
what is it
not feeling so great
s wrong with him
i dont know
eat dinner and when i dont my blood sugar
youre not hypoglycemic
phil shoots clara a quick look of
you never get the terms right phil
this is bad guys
i just cant
go any further
harry and frank look at each other not sure what to do
should we call mr
dont say his name you idiot
i was just well just throw him in the back and have her show us
hey move over to pick up phil
clara thinks fast
in my purse theres a luna bar
if you give it to me i can find it for him
with a sigh frank hands clara her purse
she rummages inside
and quickly whips out her mini spray spritzing frank right in the eyes
with a shriek he falls back grabbing his face and dropping his gun
clara makes a dash and grabs it
as frank blindly lunges after her she knees him in the balls
he collapses on the ground whimpering in pain
she spins and points the gun at harry
drop the gun and the keys
no harry drops them raising his hands
phil gets up and grabs the gun and keys then awkwardly hits harry as hard as he can on the back of the neck with the butt of the gun
harry looks at him confused
i was trying to knock you out
why ought thats what you do when phil
befuddled phil meets clara at the car and they climb in and speed away
ok let me just start from the very beginning
phil excitedly chatters next to clara at a table in an interrogation room in the police station
across the table a young police officer takes their statement we got to the restaurant late because we hit all this traffic on the highway the shortcut
i just think we might have made it on time if we stayed on the highway
your shortcuts end up being long cuts most o the time
ok are you going to tell the policeman or and i gonna tell him
you can tell him
because you always interrupt me when i try to tell stories and every time you do it disrupts my flow
fine you tell it
i wont say another word
see now ive totally lost where i was
you got to the restaurant late yeah
even using my shortcut which by the way was a shortcut and they gave away our reservation
so we were at the bar and the host was calling out for these other people over and over which is what they do right before they cancel a reservation
i thought you said you werent going to interrupt me clara
i just want him to understand we werent really stealing someone elses across the table the young police officer eyebrows raised watches phil and clara volley back and forth
do you think he really cares clara
were just kidnapped chloroformed and almost shot
i dont think hes going turn around and book us for reservation theft
am i right
so all of a sudden clara yells out that were these other people
you just took someone elses reservation
even the guy on the speakerphone couldnt believe it
you two kinda bonded over that didnt you
we didnt bond over it
im just saying speakerphone guy obviously thought it was weird to do
guys you lost we were in the restaurant
ah you mean the speakerphone guy whos kidnapped and drugged us thinks its weird to do so its weird to do
youre new buddy
and we found out speakerphone guys name phil
the young policeman looks up interested
hold on a minute
the officer dials an extension on the phone
i eeird story
n here who claim o have escaped a kid ng this evening and the name stockt came up
he hangs up
lieutenant manning likes to be notified eres anything involving mr
so you already know about this guy
you know who he is
a knock at the door and a handsome man in his late s lieutenant manning enters the room with a smile
he reaches over and shakes their hands
how do you do
the officer offers him his note pad
nah as long as theyre here might as well get everything from the horses mouth right
as the officer heads out of the room lieutenant manning sidles down into his seat
can i get you guys anything to drink
maybe a shot or two of r whiskey
that sounds more like so why dont you tell me all about your incident with mr
you tell it clara
oh dont be like that phil
youve obviously been through something traumatic tonight
thankfully its over and youre both safe and sound
maybe you should cut each other a little bit more of a break
phil and clara look at each other each letting out air
you tell him
well we never a
t ally met stockton
he was in another room on a speakerphone where these guys who kidnapped us took us
but he was obviously the one pulling the strings
who is this stockton guy anyway
let me fill you in on all that later
now why would he have wanted to kidnap you two
honestly you wouldnt believe this but its because we sat down at the wrong table tonight for dinner
looks up interest really
the wrong table
we pretended to be someone else who didnt show up for their reservations
and it turned out that these people must have something this mr
do you know what
lieutenant looks up interested then writes again
thats all you know
phil and clara look at each other
im just confused about one thing
when you took this other reservation how did you know for sure that the real gales werent going to show up late
how were you so sure the gales weren going to show up if you dont know the at all
clara looks down at the table furrowing her brow
i lost my train of thought
well i can pick things up then
phil notices clara giving him a look
why are you looking at me like that
intensifying the look im not looking at you like anything
doesnt pick up on it
ok well i had the same question for her when we sat down which she thought was rubbing her forehead clara kicks phils leg hard under the table
clara stink eyes phil again trying to get the message across
and theres that look again
lieutenant manning reaches into his jacket pocket and checks the number on the cellphone
he hops up
can you excuse me a moment
utenant manning gets up and exits the room
clara does to the window in the door and watches him walk down the hall to his office as he talks on the phone
phil puts his leg on the table pulling up his pant leg to inspect
ok im not dense clara
that was not an accident and if those werent looks phil were in trou what are you talking about
hes in on this
hes got something to do with it
the police guy

manning talks in his off ice
i know you dont
it will be contained
hanging up the phone manning walks quickly back through the police station to the interview room
he stops in the doorway
confused he turns to an officer outside at the desk
whered they go
they said you were done with them
manning walks quickly back to his office
sitting behind his desk manning enters a password on his computer and starts typing out an all points bulletin
we are close up on the computer screen as the words come clara drives as phil scans the rearview mirror from the passenger seat
we cant just go to another police station phil
we dont know how big this is
it might not just be manning
well then were screwed
who do we go to
theyre not going to believe us over a police lieutenant
this is their car phil
we gotta lose it too
searching the street clara spots a open parking space
she whips the wheel around trying to parallel park into the space
youve got it clara
spin it back now
just let me do it she spins too late and too severely hitting the curb
i hate this
its all right
you just should have spun it when i told you to
flustered she pulls back out and tries again
would you stop it
youre stressing me out
angry clara whips the car back into the spot nailing the car behind them and setting off a loud car alarm with hearing the alarm a large man rushes out
of a restaurant nearby looking at them
you just hit my the large man stomps toward them
phil and clara get out of the car and run away on the large man marches over and inspects his bumpe yells after them
they catch their breath in the alley
so weve got no car
they know where we live
so where can we shit
claras eyes go wide as it hits her as well
phil takes out his cellphone and quickly dials listening as ruth picks up
suddenly gunshots ring out over the phone
is everything ok
no its not phil
feet up ruth eats fiddle waddle as she watches an action packed chase scene on tv
its csi night
ruth hangs up the phone shaking her head and takes another mouthful of fiddle fiddle
phil looks at the phone incredulous
just call her again and tell her whats happened
phil dials the number again
ruth picks up
ruth i need you to listen
we sure do phil
we sure do
ruth slams the phone down and pulls out the phone cord so she wont be bothered again
clara tries on her phone then hangs up frustrated
now shes not picking up at all
you think this is my fault dont you
t ft no
i just dont know why you two cant get along is all
you know your mom shows me no respect clara
and you just pretend like it isnt happening
so you think its j y fault
every single other boyfriend i ever dated got along with her just wait a minute
clara starts looking through her purse for her phone
holbrooke peterson does something hush hush with the fbi
i think he even lives down here
you mean the tongue guy
holbrooke was your prom date who you said had the really long tongue right
catching herself shrugs uh yeah
something like that
she finds her phone and dials

i didnt know you were on facebook
its a networking thing for work

holbrooke peterson a thoroughbred of a man in his mid s opens the door to his candlelit apartment with a smile to find phil and clara
you look exactly the same so do you
he gives her a big tight hug lifting her a little
you feel exactly the same too
phil double takes
did he hear him right
this is my husband phil
the man who actually landed clara
holbrooke gives phil the up and down with a winning smile and holds out his hand
philly cheese steak

well cmon in
if you dont mind take off your shoes
cutsdown on the cleaning
which cuts downon the use of all those chemicals andplastics blab blah blah

as they walk into the apartment in their socks they notice the whole place is filled with reclaimed and recycled furniture and lit with candles
or the candles
did we oh no
myself off the gr a few weeks ago
i actually have a negative carbon footprint now
making up for you know all you phil i stines in the suburbs
phils about to say something when a look from clara reminds him to bite his lip
holbrooke gestures to some cardboard furniture
so have a seat
holbrooke starts to sit down himself then makes a show of taking a large gun out of his shoulder holster and putting it on the table
you carry that around at home
im supposed to sleep with her under my pillow
wish i didnt have to but i just see it as
i carry the weight so citizens like yourselves dont have to
its so funny
i always knew youd end up doing something in public service
i dont know
thats lust how i phil looks to clara can you get a load of this guy but claras focused on holbrooke
yeah unfortunately terrence stockton is not a man you want to get on the wrong side of
phil watches as holbrooke licks the salt allllll the wav around his margarita glass with his extra long tongue
clara listens intently eating some jicama slices from a platter on the table in front of them
hes like a nicaraguan turtle keeps his head deep in his shell unless he absolutely has to stick it out
those photos must be really important to him
more jicama clara
and sure no margari la to calm your nerves
no thanks im holbrooke picks up the plate and margarita glass then crosses to his indoor composter adding the extra liquid and scraps
what does stockton do
officially he runs a bunch of these exclusive private clubs downtown where his high powered friends go to let their hair down
has one place called le passage another called the rainbow e rainbow
stockton asked how we there to set things up
ive had some of my guys looking into stockton for years but nothing ever sticks to him
hes very careful ties up his loose ends and covers his tracks
but with this
he might have accidentally left himself open
the th need to do now is keep you two safe
im going to call the office put you under some protection until we figure out the best game should we be worried about our s shakes his head wouldnt be
stocktons pattern to risk ing this any larger than it is
where is he
i s staying at my m aw how is ruth
always thought the world of her
and she of you
as it comes out of her mouth clara realizes and guiltily looks over at phil bristling
holbrooke goes to a pile of already used sheets of paper and picks one up along with a pen
ill just need your full names and your socials so i can get the paperwork started at the bureau
not yours clara
know that by heart
both phil and clara are taken aback
but im sure phil a buster knows em both right
phil looks on both sides of the paper holbrooke hands him
theres already writing all over this
does another tree really need to die for me to get your socials phil
phil bites his tongue yet again squeezing the writing into a side of the paper
so just one kid guys
whats keeping you
clocks ticking clara tickety tock tuck
yeah well thats a topic for another its just that by now you and i woulda had a whole brood
under his breath thats
phil scoots the paper back to holbrooke who squints and dramatically turns it sideways
illegible egible to emergency
holbrooke and clara burst into laughter
thinking he doesnt its because youre writings hard to read phil and everyone knows how when doctors write things down no
i get it
makes a big show of putting his gun back holster as he gets up
well have you stay at the bureau for the night
safer for you
thank you so much holbrooke
sighs relieved i feel like were in good hands for the e first time tonight
as holbrooke goes into the other room to call clara lets out a sigh of relief then notices phils mood
i dont know
maybe i should have had one of holbrookes eeegerag warn raaaarrrrghereeeeetas
clam olbrooke in the front seat and phil crt in t i back they pull up and park at the fbi bui aing m smells like french fries back here
car runs on cooking oil
i just go around to restaurants and recycle their old fry oil
phils really had enough with this guy
where does it end
clara shoots phil a look he back but holbrooke doesnt get his sarcasm
how i roll
now for some reason they wanted us to come in the back entrance
he makes a big show of putting his gun back in his shoulder strap before getting out of the car
through the window we see holbrooke phil and clara walking toward the back of the building
in the foreground a shadowy guy watches them then whispers into his walkie
holbrooke uses a keycard on his keychain with a flourish to enter the rear of the building then leads phil and clara through the doors
suddenly he stops and phil and clara freeze behind them
at the other end of the hallway an fbi unit in bulletproof gear trains their weapons on the three of them
agent in the center obviously the agent in charge yells to them
continue slowly down the hallway
are they armed peterson
uh what the hells going o i dont know
well tell them to stand down
tell your men to stand down holbrooke
the agents look at each other and chuckle
what do you want us to do holbrooke
reformat our hard drives
our badass i
the laughter builds
im not the i
i help out with computer questions out of kindness
but see if that happens anymore harold
point is agent peterson scored tonight
when i typed in those socials an apb shot up with a whole laundry list on these guys
crooked cop did it
its a lie
its your booking peterson
were just here to back you up
holbrooke looks nervously between the agents and phil and clara
he turns to them taking claras arm
ill just book you and then tomorrow we can straighten the whole
pulling arm away what
oh no youre not
oooohs from the agents
you just gonna take that peterson
didnt want to have to holbrooke reaches into his holster to whip out his gun
but bobbles it and it falls to the ground right at phils feet
looking down phil instinctively grabs it holding the gun to holbrookes head
nobody move or he gets it
the agents look at each other but dont seem overly concerned
holbrooke has a gun
why does he even a have a gun
im not that important
im really not
im not the it guy but im just one step above him
no reason to do something rash all right
you think its even loaded
im not screwing around
hes not screwing around
hes not screwing around
pulling a terrified holbrooke phil and clara back toward the rear exit of the building
they try the door but its locked
he wants your keycard
he and i the communication isnt great
getting the keychain from holbrooke phil uses the keycard then lets it fall to the floor as the door unlocks and they back outside
phil and clara back away keeping holbrooke between th and the agents
through the door agents slowly creep down the hallway after them guns trained
im a bad shield
phil feels a little pumped up with claras praise
just give me your car keys holbrooke
when were about to drive off well let you go
uh they were on the keychain
n the key chain you dre d with the keycard inside
the keys were on that
and so the hero falls
well never outrun them
searching around phil eyes the keycard panel outside the entrance
he aims the gun and fires missing badly
both he and holbrooke cover their ears
man is that loud
as the agents run toward the door clara quickly grabs the gun from phil and shoots nailing the lock
stunned looks at her how are you so good at that
the agents try the door but are locked in
agent tells his men to stand back and tries shooting the glass but its bulletproof
he gestures and all the agents rush around to the front
gotta get going
they both look around unsure
across the bridge a few blocks down that street theres an entrance to the green line subway
get on it and you can get anywhere in this city
phil and clara look at him confused
arent you supposed to be our hostage
i dont know
whats the difference
im never gonna get behind that desk now anyway
i dropped it in front of everybody
it wasnt so much of a drop
it was more of a
yeah a bobbles bad
listen if you just leave me here i can tell them you ran the other way
itll buy you time to get there
and maybe i can work on clearing all this up for you
phil and clara look at each other then start to run away
suddenly phil stops thinking
let me have the gun
as clara gives it to him phil quickly runs back and hands it to holbrooke here
tell them you got it back from us
holbrooke takes back his aun grateful
as phil runs back clara takes in the nice gesture of husband
a lit up raucous party boat in a canal starts to pass under a roadway bridge up ahead as phil and clara trying to stay in the shadows walk quickly
phil glances back over their shoulders the road is deserted
its just on the other side of that bridge
i think were going to make it
he notices clara looking at him
that was just nice of you back there
this is crazy but you know what im reminded of right now
im talking about right now
when we used to walk home late at night after going downtown to the clubs
we couldnt ever find a cab remember
wed grab those healthy dogs and cheese fries at the weiners circle and go to the adler planetarium to watch the sunrise
where i held your hand for the first time
i cant believe we used to stay up all night like that
its because we could sleep til noon
if i remember correctly we werent always sleeping
beat as they share the moment together walking
i just dont understand when we got so
i dont know
no i was thinking numb
when did we become one of those couples that we used to look at in restaurants back then and think were so sad
were not that bad phil
i just think we havent been that honest with each other recently
phil doesnt understa not big things
just little things keep adding up and putting this thing between us
like the fact i know you never want to talk about us having this other baby
its not that i dont want another kid clara
i used to be the whole pie with you
and now with ollie and your work im barely even a piece of the pie anymore
im like maybe a pecan on a piece of the pie
so part of mes not jumping at the chance of having the little pecan i have left of your attention going into some new babys mouth
but thats crazy phil
when youre home youre the one who seems like your hardly even there
its all about your work
believe me if you clara suddenly notices a police car lights off drive past them over the bridge
i think were ok
just play cool and keep walking
the patrol car continues across and down the street
i phil and clara breathe a sigh of relief
then suddenly a few blocks down brake lights
the patrol car turns around and turns on its lights zooming back toward them
now you can say shit
phil looks around theyre in the middle of the bridge with no place to run
then he notices the lit up party boat coming out the other side of the bridge beneath them
e s only a few feet
what u high
but looking main at the patrol car speeding toward them phil grabs clara and dashes for the side of the bridge
as shes yanked over the side clara clutches onto the railing
with phil hanging onto her other arm they dangle above the water and the boat
are you crazy
let go clara
a group of drunken partiers on the boat spotting them cheer below
some even take flash pictures
phil looks down if they dont let go soon theyre literally going to miss the boat
go or im going to tickle you
no youre not phil
we have a rule
im not he reaches up and tickles clara under her arm
stop it phil
its not funny
i mean stop it
clara cant hold on any longer
they land thump
onto the top deck of the boat both groaning as they roll back and forth while the drunken partiers cheer and flash photos
i think i broke my butt
whats our rule about tickling
i didnt do it for pleasure
what is our rule
its only funny if its funny for the both of us
and guess what
it wasnt funny for me phil
clara gets up and storms off clutching her arm
walking down the side of the boat she passes a man down on one knee in front of an excited woman who nods accepting his proposal
b i g mistake
they look at her stunned
phil limps along finally finding clara alone and calmed down looking out over the rear of the boat
he comes next to her
t s your elbow
s ok how s your butt
well for jumping off a bridge onto a moving boat not so bad
i cant even fucking believe this is happening to us
you know were kind of running ou ons
maybe we could just hide or something until this all blows over
what makes you think it ever wil iaybe we should just turn ourselves
imagine what its going to be like for ollie when everyone hears about this tomorrow
i bet our pictures are going to be all over the papers
phil nods gazing out
then suddenly an idea comes to him
what if we found the pictures
what do you mean
these pictures that everyones after
we could get them wed have some kind o bargaining chip to get out of this
but then wed have to find the gales
dont know anything about them
the pictures have something to do with that place
yeah but even so holbrooke said these clubs are so secret you have to know where they are and how to get in clara rummages through her purse and grabs
her phone dialing then notices phil looking out shaking his head
youre not listening to me again
you have to know where they are and h to get in thats great
clara wanna cracker
im calling because of what you said phil
i know who can help us
clara dials the number
hey jane its clara
where am i
beat looks around im
im on a party cruise around chicago
it is turning into quite a night
listen we need to go to this club called the rainbow later
do you know how we can get in
clara looks at phil excited and nods as she plugs her ear and listens
phil watches her until he notices the boat is turning
he looks around the side
a slew of police cars on the shore
he taps clara
clara turns and looks
you know what jane
ive actually gotta jump off right now
police swarm all over the tour boat checking every compartment
a drunken partier shows lieutenant manning snapshots of phil and clara landing groaning and arguing on the back of his digital camera
a policeman comes up to manning and shakes his head
manning pockets the camera and starts to walk away
thats mine man
the partier mumbles asshole as he stumbles manning si i
s and looks out over the wa
its windy and cold as phil and clara soaked squeak and slosh down the street
clara missing one heel dumps water out of her purse as she checks her cellphone
mines totally shot too
you got the info from her though right
yeah but we cant get in looking like this phil
i dont think we have a choice
not a big shopping hour
they walk past the chicago fitness center lights blazing
windows show machines filled with young hardbodies working out
now if we wanted to do a little cardio on the other hand
who knew that many people worked out at in the morning
clara thinks a moment then stops in her tracks and looks back up at the building
you wanna do a little cardio
clara smirks at him then phil thinking gets it
he shakes his head
ok now thats scary
you know youre starting to think like a real criminal
you know that dont you
clara waggles her eyebrows
we hear devos secret agent man over a trc ge
phil and clara walk up to the front counter where the gym greeter boredly watches tv
they say something and the greeter waves them through without looking up
as they hurry on the greeters tv goes to a promo teaser for the local late night news a snapshot of phil and clara from the boat with a caption
that reads bonnie and
in the mens locker room phil pulls at the combination locks searching for an open locker
unable to find one he picks up a bench to throw it at them when two jocks in workout clothes walk in and look at him strangely as he holds
phil moves the bench back and forth pretending its part of his exercise routine
in the womens locker room clara wrapped in a towel blows out her hair at the mirror
an attractive thin woman walks behind her toward the showers and they smile at each other in the mirror
as the thin woman disappears behind the shower glass clara makes a mad dash for the lockers
back in the mens locker room phil lingers as a man in a dark suit undresses getting ready to work out
as the man is about to lock his locker phil rushes up to him excitedly telling him something and pointing outside
the man confused exits and phil moves in quickly undressing
the attractive thin woman comes back to her locker and opens it
her face drops
inside hang cl a s dripping outside the gym phil looking slick in a colored shirt and black suit walks quickly around the corner then stops stunned
clara waiting for him with her hair blown out and in a tight fitting red flapper dress with a red heels looks amazing
from her expression she feels the same about phil
looking both ways phil and clara walk nervously down a dark derelict alley
its what she said
and if you die does jane get your commissic l on the open house
up ahead a two s y looking characters huddle near a bunch of garbage cans watching them a small fire nearby
nervously clara approaches
men shoot her a fierce look
do you know which is the way back to kansas
they eye her then inspect phil up and down
one of them lunges and phil jumps back
but hes moving aside some trash cans revealing a rainbow colored stairway going down
welcome to the rainbow
reaching the bottom of the stairway phil and clara amazed take in the rainbow
its a cavernous abandoned subway station thats been converted into a glamorous club
the place is packed with an elite looking crowd
everything in the room the carpet the tapestries the clothes of the waitstaff is emerald green
phil and clara nod at each other then separate disappearing into the mix
phil looks around amazed as he wanders between blackjack and baccarat tables where well to do older guests gamble large sums of money fast looking women cheering them on
if you wanner be pissed at anyone about it be pissed at stockton
hearing the name phil spots a balding man talking to other men at one of the tables
he lingers closer
you know rumor is hes behind the whole mess
raking it in on both ends
what do you mean
hush hush shell companies he owns
one of them hires all the construction inspectors
another hes got rents all the construction equipment
the more one slows things down with violations more the other takes to the bank
the balding man leans in and speaks more quietly causing phil to lean in even more
my guess is hes trying to screw up mayor diggs reelection
imagine what someone like him could do if he got someone less squeaky clean in the mansion
the balding man suddenly notices phil listening
phil pastes on an excited face
from the side
confused you with somebody else
phil quickly moves on
clara talks to a busy bartender at the bar as he scrambles to fill drink orders
really get s
thanks any way
with a sigh clara starts away from the bar when she ough the crowd frank and harry walk right toward her but they havent seen her yet
clara spots the kitchen doors nearby and rushes through
kitchen c vuous clara peeks out through the double door windows
frank and harry continue through the crowd unaware
clara quickly hugs a large bulletin board covered with pictures and time schedules as a waiter carries a large tray of food past her
as she moves off the wall some papers drop
clara pins them back on when something else on the bulletin board catches her eye
among all the snapshots of staff scattered on the bulletin board is a picture of a backyard party with a whole group of laughing young people and the middle of
the picture smiling at the camera
is the nervous woman from the signature room clara pulls the picture off the wall
she catches a waitress coming back through the double doors
does she work here
i guess she still does
hasnt been showing up lately though
do you know where i can find her
you could try back tomorrow see if she i need to find her tonight
did you try rays place
that sleazebag boyfriend of hers
hes got that place a few blocks from here where he used to throw those after work parties
do you remember where it is
phil scans the crowds back and forth
hearing his name phil nervously turns
rivers and george stand together in a corner
this is a surprise
what are you doing down here
well same thing as you guys i would guess
working those extra hours right
clara looking amazing in her red flapper dress weeds through the crowd
rivers and george take her in obviously impressed
phil we gotta go
i found out where clara you remember mr
clara suddenly notices phils boss
and im george
sorry but ive got to steal him
weve gotta be somewhere else right now
at in the morning
where are you guys headed
im sorry mr
we really can talk about it
phil and clara move off quickly through the crowd as mr
rivers watches the hand i e dressed up couple intrigued
phil foster with places to go he can talk about at in the morning
you know what makes kangaroos so damn dangerous george
they look so sweet and tame so you forget theyre wild animals
lethal when they want to be
george not fully understanding chuckles and holds out his hand for another handshake but mr
rivers still watching phil leaves him hanging
a tv monitor image of phil and clara making their way through the crowd to the exit
in the dark room frank and harry look expectantly to the well dressed man in a dark suit who absently twirls with two metal balls in his hand
see where they take you
phil and clara knock on the door of a the deserted looking row house
clara tries the door
that never really opens
she shoots phil a look
phil and clara inch insi as they start down the dark hallway to the living room phil hunches over hugging the wall
are you bent over like that
rut why dont you just walk normally and quietly
this is the wav i sneak
you sneak in your way and ill sneak in mine ok
i was just asking
clara walks quietly behind crouching phil
reaching the living room they spot two packed suitcases on the couch
suddenly the door slams behind them and ray holds a gun to phils head dora nervously next to him
who are you
you know thats like the th gun ive had to my head tonight
just lower that thing and cool it ok
off guard from phils reaction ray confused does
she was in the bathroom at the restaurant
who are you
who are we
well everybody thinks were the gales because we were lucky enough to take your reservation tonight
why would you take our reservation
phil shoots clara a look
both of you
stand ov there in the corner
dammit dora eres your goddamn brother
he was e
zed to b here an hour ago
i dont know ra hes not answering his phone
yeah well if these guys found u long do you think its gonna take other guys
in the corner clara raises her hand
ray eyes her strangely
i have to pee
you have to nee
thats my wife
flustered ray waves dora to take clara
dora talks to clara as she washes her face in the sink
you must just think im awful
i dont think anything about you
i just want this to be over
ray saw mr
stockton making all this money blackmailing people at the club
when he found out who was interested in me
he said it would be so easy
wed never have to work again
ray peeks nervously out of the window searching the street
listen it looks like things didnt turn out the way you planned but i think all stockton wants is his pictures back
as soon as he gets them i bet
think theyre stocktons pictures
you really have no idea what youve gotten into do you
the window shatters and ray and phil hit the deck
as ray starts blindly firing back phil crawls on his knees and elbows across the floor toward the bathroom
ray spots phil crawling away and gets up turning to him
get suddenly ray is shot in the arm through the window
he drops to the ground in pain yelling and clutching his arm
phil crabs along even faster
clara rushes to the bathroom door pulling phil inside and locking it
as clara focuses on phil dora thinks fast taking an elope out of her purse and putting it into claras bout them seeing
are you hit
on the core
as harry kicks the gun away from ray moaning on the floor frank comes to the bathroom door
he lightly raps on it then speaks softly
how about you guys let me in before someone gets really hurt
dora quickly opens the window and gestures for phil and clara to climb through
just as they squeeze outside
the door handles blown off and frank kicks the door in
he grabs dora rushing toward the window but phil and clara are gone
frank eyes dora then shoots her in the foot sending screaming to the ground in pain
you stay put
he hurries back through the house
phil and clara sprint to the street as a buick pulls up in front and a confused looking chubby guy steps hey
which is maple street
youre doras brother
who are you
the roads are all screwed with all this construction boom
they wince as a shot hits the rearview mirror of the car
all three spin to see frank aiming his gun and marching toward them harry right behind him
phil quickly pushes doras brother aside as he and clara hop into the buick and peel out
frank and harry sprint for their towncar down the block
phil screeches the car around the corner
phil whips the car around another bend
its not going to do any good if you taking another sharp turn clara
just leave the driving to me ok
i know what im smash
they hit something head on shattering the windshield
shaking glass off himself phil peers forward
theyre face to face nose to nose with another broken windshield
in the drivers seat of a souped up honda h fiber optic colored lights a young black dude a stares at them in shock
no no no
tell me you did not just do that
the black dude gets out of his car to inspect head in hands
you did not just do that
whew you gonna be payin for this
owe you one
phil throws the car into reverse but his tires just screech smoke the wheels spinning in place
looking out his window toward the front phil sees that the black dude comes toward him
oh no no no
youre gonna get outta this car and hand me over a license and some insurance
we gonna do this right
man i think i got whiplash and shit
phil looks back to see frank and harrys totnncar coming around the corner
thinking fast phil jumps out of his car and hops into the black dudes souped up honda
what do you think youre doing
the black dude chases after him trying the drivers door but phils locked it
phil yells to clara
frank and harrys car speeds towards them
it will smash into them in seconds
freaked clara hops to the drivers seat and switches to reverse and guns it
at the same moment phil steps on the gas
the black dude hanging onto the drivers door screams as hes thrown onto the hood
the conjoined cars shimmy shammy backward just in time to dodge the towncar
the black dude scrambles for his life through the windshield into the passengers seat next to phil
phil this is to black dude mumbling angrily clara puts her car in drive and steps on it
their cars lurch then burn asphalt as the wheels smoke and speed up in the other direction
they race past frank again who angrily whips the towncar around in pursuit
looking over his shoulder phil tries to steer their conjoined cars down the middle of the street but he and clara are out of sync and their attached cars veer
ildly back and forth
they hit the curb at an angle and jck down a whole row of mail boxes until phil spins h s v reel getting them back into the street
just let me out ok
you can have it
i you can have it
im not yelling
im just talking in an very animated voice
looking back over his shoulder again phil sees theyre approaching the lar ge intersection with michigan avenue
ok now when i say so spin your wheel
on his command clara spins her wheel sharply to t right
but its the wrong way and their cars jack across the road
an oncoming suv honks desperately
flustered clara whips her wheel in the other direction and their two cars tilt up on four wheels out of eight barely screeching past
landing again and taking in a deep breath phil shoots her a pissed off look
you just said spin the wheel phil
you didnt say which way
yes i did
no you didnt
you di god
can we take him home
i need him
both phil and the black dude sees that the towncars turned onto michigan avenue and is still right behind e them
i say our best chance is to reverse again then use both engines to floor as fast as we can all the way down michigan
why stay on michigan
why stay on michigan
because its a wider street
its also a busier street
i think it would be better to try to branch off
why do you have a problem with every route i take
flustered phil turns to the black dude next to him to commiserate unaware that his steering wheel drifts
she does this wherever we go
phil doesnt notice the lights growing brighter behind him
phil and the black dude look over their shoulders to see theyre heading straight for a phil spins the wheel sharply and they go sideways jumping the curb and soaring
into millennium park
in their car following them frank and harrys mouths drop
the conjoined cars sail across the grass and smash through a barrier landing on the mccormick ice rink
their cars pinwheel out of control across the ice
phil clara and the black dude are all wide eyed as the world is a spinning blur around them
finally they hit the other side
getting his bearings phil sees the towncar has entered the park after them
he searches where to go next then spots something
reverse it keep it straight put your foot to the floor
give it everything
clara reverses and phil puts the car in drive and floors it
the car goes faster
i really woulc n
t be doing that
what are you doing
clara glances over her shoulder
their heading strai toward a concrete stairway
just trust me
the conjoined cars hit the steps and their wheels smoke as the two engines power together all the way up the the towncar tries the follow them but its single
engine doesnt have enough power
swearing under his breath frank reverses back down the steps
phil and the black guy both look back over their shoulders as they speed by anish kapoors large metallic cloud gate
no sign of the towncar
the black guy holds up his hand for phil
that last move was wicked man
they try to give each other a fancy handshake but phil the whitest man ever muddles it up
they peek again over their shoulders
the towncars driven around and is now back on their tails
what the hell are you guys in trouble for
f i ght
you name it
phil and claras conjoined cars barrel across the gr ss of the great lawn in millennium park then spin onto columbus drive the towncar giving chase
phil peeks back over his shoulder then sighs looking at clara
can we just try to work together at this
im not blaming you
now whatever direction i give you take your normal version of it and tone it down like percent ok
clara breathes deeply and turns her wheel slightly lefts they zoom around the corner
that was awesome
now give me a medium right
she does and they veer sharply and perfectly onto another street
now were cooking with fire
now tiny le you act it
they make the slightest turn
spotting something ahead no
clara turns around to look
lights flash as a barrier comes down across the road a drawbridge ahead is slowly rising
phil looks behind the towncars got them closed in
the black dude peeks back as well then turns to phil
say we can pop you guys up and over
what are you talking about pop you guys up and over
you climb over then we both reverse it and leadfoot the motherfuckers
send you flying over the top
sucking in a breath phil hands control of the car back to the black dude
as the conjoined cars zoom toward the drawbridge phil crawls on the attached hoods from one windshield to the other sitting next to clara
phil dont even think of it
can do it
here we go now
but phil reaches over and switches the gear to reverse stepping on claras foot to gun it
the two cars smoke as their wheels spin in opposite directions then dislodge
phil and claras car flies reverse up one side of the diagonal drawbridge
and lands spinning in a flurry of sparks over on the other side causing air bags to deploy all around phil and clara
the black dude spins his steering wheel jack knifing his honda across the road and puts on his seat belt
frank and harrys eyes go wide as frank jams on his brakes but the towncar crashes right into the honda
ugh his broken window the black dude grins at frank and harry
hope you all got insurance
hitting a button he starts a fiber optic light show on his honda
as their car comes to a smoking spinning stop in the middle of the deserted road phil sandwiched in air bags catches his breath
we did it
we did it
a door slam
phil moves an air bag aside to see clara marching away down the street
phil rushes after clara trying to catch up
where are you going
i want to make sure that at least one our sons parents survives tonight
you almost just got us killed
i almost got us killed
forget about the people chasing and shooting at us all night long because of the reservation you stole
theres a difference between fleeing from people shooting at you and knowingly driving a car in reverse over an open drawbridge
you know all you complain about is that i dont take risks anymore
then the second i do you get mad at me for doing it
i cant win with you
you have i so bad dont you
oh you have no idea
every single day from the moment we wake up youre bossy a disapproving inconsiderate im inconsiderate
have you ever seen our bathroom in the morning after tsunami phils blown through
you use my toothbrush
whats the difference
afraid youre gonna get my cooties
i want my own toothbrush phil
and how many years have i asked you to do a simple thing like put the toilet paper in right
listen to yourself
you have problems with how i pqt in the toilet paper
because under makes no sense phil
under makes no sense
when its under it doesnt pull off right
it just keeps spinning and spinning and doesnt cascade properly
after ten years of asking you to have roll the right way you still cant do it
yeah how about the fact that i have not woken up with our comforter over me once in those nears
you steal the whole thing away from me every night and mummify yourself
phil i do not steal the comforter
it just happens when were points at her bulls bull shit
dont you point that at me
i see your hock leg lock maneuver
dont think i dont
you wrap that leg around and lock the comforter down then reeeeel it in so i cant pull it at all
i do not leg lock the comforter
oh yes you do
u think i dont know your little icks
where you leave like half a thimble of milk in the carton and put it back in the fridge so you dont have to be the one to finish it
and replace it
i do that
you know why do that clara
because you dont want to haul your ass to the market to buy it yourself
because im afraid to
god forbid i the wrong kind of grass fed bio homogenized whatever and meet your wrath
youre like the nutrition nazi
and ive got to be your little nutrition nazi goebbels because we have to be this united front with ollie
whats wrong if he eats two bowls of captain sugar instead of one
or if his handwriting isnt perfect
or if he goes to school for one day not dressed like finneas j
i feel so sorry for you
i must be hard having to be the cool fun parent while i get to be the one who makes sure our childs fed clothed and how would you even
you dont give me or anyone else a chance
youre so goddamn controlling
youve got to be wonder woman keeping everyone in line looking down on them from her fancy wonder woman plane and controlling everything with all her wonder superpowers
you paint yourself as this victim but you get off on being the superlady
you know w sometimes i dont pay attention to you phil
because you give me a headache
clara angrily rummages through her purse then lets out a frustrated sigh
no aspirin in the wonderpurse
how could it be
clara furious hurls her purse at phils head
he ducks and the contents spill all over the road
screw you phil
even if i survive tonight im screwed all around anyway
screwed with you
screwed with my job
what are you talking about screwed with your job
was supposed to spend all tonight guring out a new brilliant plan for the fund so george wouldnt take it over tomorrow
doesnt look like thats gonna happen
why didnt you tell me
i dont know clara
maybe because i didnt want you chiming in on how mr
rivers was right
he wants the new guy for all the reasons you complain about me
someone who doesnt play it safe
someone wholl take a risk
i cant believe thats what you think do
you know when you set up this whole magical night in that dress
i got this glimmer that it was going to be like it used to be with us
i dont know
i guess were just not those people anymore
i guess were not
shaking his head phil turns and walks away do the street
clara trying to hold it together h and starts to gather the items from her purse something catches his eye
she picks up the envelope that dora put in her bag
as phil walks along clara comes running up behind him
she steps in front of him trying to catch her breath
i think we said all needs to be said right now clara
panting clara holds out the manila envelope
she hands phil the manila envelope and bends down trying to stop her cramp
confused phil opens it and looks at the pictures inside
his brow furrows
what is it
clara looks over his shoulder shakes her head and turns the picture the other way around
phils eyes go wide
its the mayor
phil looks at clara taking it all in
i bet this didnt have anything to do with stockton at first
phil and clara walk quickly down the street as they piece things together
the mayor must have gone to stocktons club one night
he saw dora working there and obviously gave some sign that he was interested
so much for mr
squeaky clea her sleazy boyfriend ray finds out and convinces her to take him up on it so they could photograph it and blackmail him
they knew it was an election year and he would have to pay them whatever they asked
but somehow stockton found out about the photos too and wanted that power over the mayor himself
so he sent his guys to the restaurant to intercept the gales and get the photos
but ray and dora spotted them and bailed before the mayor even had a chance to show up
he snaps his fingers
if we could find some way to get in touch with the mayor directly without anyone else knowing there actually might be a way out of this for us
clara thinks for a moment
a light comes to her eyes
phil and clara walk into the lobby of the doorman building and start toward the elevator straight past the whoa whoa whoa
where do you youre going
oh were guests of apartment the doorman picks up the phone to call the apartmen and you are
looks at him in shock
are you crazy
its in the morning
we were lust out for dinner
im not really allowed to just let you up there
just look at us
the doorman looks at phil and clara a white well dressed suburban couple
the elevator door opens and they get inside
have a nice night
as the elevator doors close phil and clara look at each other then simultaneously slip paper bags with eye and mouth holes over their heads
cardigan in her frilly nightgown with her eyemask pulled up on her forehead walks through her dark living room toward the pounding on her front door
all as mrs
cardigan opens the door phil and clara in their masks bum rush her
screaming cardigan dodges running back to her desk
phil and clara give chase but cardigan grabs a large metal yardstick and starts whopping phil over and over on his paper bag head screaming the whole time
clara grabs her from behind bringing her down
rubs his paper bag head
having put cardigans eyenask back over her eyes clara bag off holds cardigan in a chair as phil comes back into the living room holding two spools of fuzzy yarn
i cant find any rope
just use that
ill start looking
phil gets to work wrapping the yarn over and over tying cardigans arms to the back of the chair while clara searches cardigans desk
you two werent very prepared
you should have been more prepared
thought ahead and brought the rope you
ok why dont you lay off the critiqu s not a critique
its a fact
oh is it a fact
ng word choice
wrong word choice
well let me throw a little word choice correction your way
five year old kids cant be antagonistic
phil looks over
clara makes the cut it out gesture across her throat
if youre done tying her up come over and help
phil crosses the room and starts going through notebooks on the desk
the names cardigan not rockefeller if you havent figured it out yet
you must be such a positive influence on our youth
youre one to talk
i listen lady just sit tight and well be out of here before you know it
phil picks up and flips quickly through a notebook when he spots something and doubles back starting to read
his brow furrows
clara deep in her own workbook suddenly brightens
she notices phils expression
hands the book to clara to read
she does and darkens
oliver told her hes being mean to je y briggs because
he says he wants to marry her
and thats what married people do
as this hits them phil and clara look at each other then at mrs
cardigan blindfolded in the living room
whats wrong over there
no crown jewels yet
lets make the call the phone rings in mayor reynolds bedroom
he hops up and peers at the clock am then at the caller id
he looks over at his wife who snores loudly with earplugs in then picks up the phone confused
is everything ok
on the phone in cardigans office phil is confused
stunned you and the mayor are on a first name basis
youre calling our mayor in the middle of the night
i had nothing to do with this charlie
appened to aboundaries matter
what happened to that bitch
how about you put a sock in it now
who is this
you dont know me mr
mayor but ive recently come into possession of something that you were supposed to get from the gales tonight
silence on the line
and whether you realize it or not we ended up doing you a favor
you see this man named mr
stockton i know if you know him i know who he is
well he tried to steal the photos from the gales
hes even got cops on his payroll helping him out
we think he was planning to sabotage your re election
so what do you want for them
what do we want
phil looks at clara
we just want our lives back
we want to go home mr
the mayor looks over nervously as his wife stirs
she goes back to snoring and he whispers into the phone again
mayor diggs breathes out and rubs his forehead
if you really can get me
what i was supposed to receive earlier without this getting out i promise you ill take care of your safety
but now the police think that trust me
get me the photos and he wont be bothering you again
clara sees phil furrow his brow confused
phils concentrating hard on something
well meet you at the adler planetarium in hour
e the mayor rubs his forehead
the mayor hangs up the phone and quietly leaves the bedroom
downing a glass of scotch the mayor sits at his desk and lets out a sigh of relief
he picks up his desk phone and dials
we dodged a bullet
they calac e
stockton sits at his desk staring at a blueish monitor screen
on stocktons monitor in front of him we see that frank and harry hold a wounded ray and dora in the meat locker
they thought you were stealing the photos from the gales to try to blackmail me yourself
did they now
theyre going to meet me in an hour with them
st keeps getting better
phil and clara sit silently on the steps of the beautiful old alder planetarium looking at dawn hitting the chicago skyline
man i love this city
when was the last time we watched the sunrise together
probably the last time we were here
it was the morning that ollie was born
youre the morning ollie was born
they look at each other remembering
man im starving
sorry you never got your truffles
clara reaches into her purse
who needs white truffles when youve got a lemon zest luna bar
clara breaks it in two and hands half to phil
they click the halves together toasting each other then silently chew looking out
phil shakes his head and starts giggling
ok what happened to us tonight
the hell are we doing here
clara starts laughing too
its not funny
no i know its not funny
its not funny at all
en why are you laughing
why are you laughing
theyre both cracking up
then phil notices a moment later that claras laughter has turned to wha e gonna be ok cla no
its not that
this is nice
tears up again you dont understand
i really dont want to be wonder woman phil
i dont at all
you dont see that this whole time im flying in a glass plane
in a glass mane
uh ok but i think wonder woman actua flies an invisible plane not a glass plane
this makes clara break into a bigger round of sobs
it isnt even there at all
i dont even have a plane
im running on fumes
youre not running on fumes clara
im not trying to be uptight or controlling
or a nutrition
im just trying the only way i know how to keep everything from fall apart
it wont fall apart
and i really can help whenever you feel like it is
you just never act like you need me to
thats because as it is you see us as a distraction from your work
you think i see you guys as a distraction
god no clara
you dont understand
i have this wife who does everything better than anyone ive ever known
and the greatest son
you want to know why i obsess so much about my stupid job
because i want to feel like
like i can do something good enough to deserve someone like you
i mean i look at you and i jest dont stack up
thats crazy phil
youre a god man
youre the best man i know
ill never be the guy who remembers always put toilet paper on the right way
i dont think i would really want to be with that guy phil
want us to be on the same team again
as clara sniffles phil takes this in for a beat
listen you know what i said before about not being the people we used to be
phil we were angry no clara
and i know im going to drive you crazy again and youre definitely going to drive me crazy
but i wouldnt want to do it with anybody else
he hugs her tight
we had a good fight tonight didnt we
yeah we did
you know the worst part about not talking about all this recently
we missed out on a lot of make up sex
and our make up sex woulda rocked
phil s when he spots something behind clara
mayor diggs looks both walks from his car in the parking lot toward the
here we go
tell me now
do you need to pee
they get up and start walking down the steps to meet him
phil and clara meet the mayor at the bottom of the steps
clara takes the manila envelope out of her purse handing it to him
this is what youre looking for
ive tten down our information inside
and thats it
were going home now
the mayor nods and phil and clara start walking past him toward the parking lot
mayor diggs stays behind nervously tapping the envelope in his hand
as phil and clara get halfway to the lot all the mayors car doors open and manning frank harry and mr
stockton climb out
frank and harry pop the trunk and grab sheets of clear plastic
phils eyes go wide
phil and clara start to run when a gunshot hits the ground in front of them
they turn when another shot rings out
the next one wont be a warning shot
they look over to see manning training a gun as he and stockton walk toward them harry and frank behind with the plastic
to harry and frank lets do it over there
y and frank quickly throw the plastic sheets down on the grass nearby
im going to wait in the c r dont mind
sure thing mr
as mayor diggs starts to walk back to the parking lot he opens the manila envelope
manning gestures for phil and clara to walk to the plastic sheets
please dont do over there
we have a child
said over there
i j ph i l just me then ok
i promise you shes not going to say anything
we have a child
last time im going to say it
resigned phil and clara sadly look at each other then walk to stand in front of the plastic on the ground
on your knees
phil scared holds out his hand to clara
she takes looking back at him and they kneel in front of the plastic side by side
stockton nods to lieutenant manning who checks his gun
stockton and lieutenant inning turn
mayor diggs sifts through pages of docj j tts that were in t h w wila envelope
eally were planning to give you the pictures mr
that is until you
sre so casual about is not needing to worry about the cop who was after us
that made me a little suspicious because i never told you which cop it was
then we got to talking and realized how dumb we were
e if you came on to some waitress at the rainbow you must have felt pretty darn comfortable there
which meant stockton was probably your buddy
where are the pictures
but we were still confused because if you guys are buddies how do you explain the falconwood corporation
stocktons face blanches
theyre obviously not going to tell us
just shoot them
ive heard that name
whats the falconwood corporation
runs the hiring of inspectors for the department of highways in chicago
you know the ones who have been finding all those violations
i said shoot them
i work for the mayor terrence
why do you keep interrupting terrence
maybe because according to the paperwork youve got there he owns falconwood
not only that youll see those other pages that he also owns a cc rpany called eurostruct which rents the city all of its construction equipment
frank and harry reach for their guns but manning turns his gun on them
the more violations falconwood finds the longer eurostruct rents the equipment
that turns into big bucks mr
im sure thats not a moral problem for you but hes kind of screwing you in an election year isnt he
some of us are pretty pissed off about the roads
mayor diggs flips through the documents taking it all you did this to me
i dont get it terrence
how much do you need
i have the lieutenant here watch your back on all of your gambling clubs oh do you mean the ones that you gamble at
where i cover your debts
i slipped your company no bid foreclosed buildings for a dollar each downtown
stockton a you think that pays for what i do for you
the girls i have to pay off
the jet charters
and lets not even get into your re election fund
lets not even go there
listen to them
stockton angrily pulls his own the gun out of his jacket pocket shoving it against the back of phils neck
how did you get this
tha be from me
stockton and others turn around to see holbrooke p if son brandi
g his gun and looking like the fbi he always t e to be leap a pack of cher agen is as they jt of the l i t riu
manning tried to object pulling out his bad yeah yeah
i know all about you buddy
with a smile phil and clara get up disconnecting the wires under their clothing
seeing them hand over the wires to holbrooke it hits mayor diggs what hes just revealed
makes you feel any better i wasnt gonna vote for you anyway
as holbrooke drops phil and clara off in front of their house his blackberry buzzes and he checks it
they just need me downtown in half an hour for a news conference with the deputy mayor
want it for the morning shows
dont think theyre going to be calling you the it guy any more
listen guys i feel weird about not even acknowledging you two
but you should be up there with me
you handed this whole case to me
smiles winks yeah well thats how we roll
they get out of the car and start up the driveway
as clara opens the front door phil slowly bends down picking up the morning paper
up bright and early aren phil looks over to see his overly cheery neighbor chaz in his jogging suit
he smiles appreciating chaz for the first time
we sure are
as he joins clara on the doorstep they take each other in
you have your presentation in a few hours
you know i think im gonna be ok
i had a good time tonight
it was fun
lets do this again sometime
for the first time the whole night they kiss
interlocking fingers they head inside closing their front door behind them
