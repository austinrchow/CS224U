written by thomas lennon robert ben garant previous revisions by jason fulardi scott alexander larry karaszewki march rd a fishing boat pushes over choppy water
four gun toting men on jet skis wearing black wet suits and goggles escort the boat
flying above it is a helicopter
a serbian man captains the wheel
serb scans the horizon with binoculars
he checks the gps system then his watch then speaks into his throat mic
all italics are serbian w subtitles fifteen minutes to delivery
the jet skier in the lead weighs in on a radio
the helicopter pilot weighs in
all clear from above
the camera descends as the boat passes and dives beneath the surface
the droning of engines becomes less pronounced
foam from the boat and skis bubbles
then from out of nowhere five navy seals wearing re breathers appear in neat formation like the blue angels
jet propelled backpacks push the seals through the water
the lead seal shane wolfe points upwards
all eyes follow his finger to the underbelly of the boat above
from his belt shane takes a steel wand with an adhesive disc attached aims it at the fleeing boat and fires
a cable shoots up thud
the disc sticks to the boats hull
shane pushes a button on the wand retracting the cable and drawing himself closer
dangling from the cruiser shane fixes a bomb to the hull
he releases himself from the boat and speeds away
a dense explosion sends ripples through the water and electricity crackling around the boat
a surge of electrical force blasts from the control panel
the two serbian men jolt backwards wham and hit the wall
all the needles inside all the dials go limp
the roar of the engines dies and the boat stops
shane slips inside the hull through the new hole
the chopper slows to a hover
the pilot looks below
the jet skiers protectively circle the injured boat in a synchronized swimming move and the jet ski drivers are simultaneously yanked below the surface a split second later theyre replaced
by our seals also in black wet suits and goggles the switch happens in less than a second way too fast for anyone to notice
the shaken serbs climb to their feet
they look around and see the seals on the jet skis in the masks they are indistinguishable from the gun totting men they switched paces with
all seems clear
serb pushes on the throttle
weve been hit
were taking on water
suddenly the boat lists and water pours in under the cabin door
they spring into action
grab the professor quick
serb rushes out shouting orders he alerts four armed guards and the jet ski drivers now our seals
something must be below us
the armed guards fire relentlessly into the water
serb rushes below deck
professor charles plummer bound to a chair and gagged tries to yelp as the room begins to flood with water
serb runs down steps to the lowermost hold
he tries to force the door open
when it finally opens he is forced back by a three foot wall of water
professor plummer panics as the water rises up to his mouth he struggles but cant get free
up to his nose over his head
then shane wolf rises out of the water hauling the professor up
he cuts the professors gag
shane removes his mouth piece
shane doesnt seem the slightest bit fazed by the circumstances
lieutenant shane wolfe united states navy
im gonna get you outta here
but you have to do exactly what i say when i say it
my way no highway option
do you copy
plummer nods terrified
wheres the briefcase
the professor gestures across the room where a metal briefcase is floating
shane calmly handcuffs it to his own waist
as the water rises to the roof
how did you know where i
shane sticks the mouth piece into plummers mouth giving him his oxygen
the armed guards stop shooting into the water
one of our seals calls out to them in perfect serbian the guards fire again
the seal speaks into his neck mic
give it a second theyre almost out of ammo
the seal calls out shoot more more
they do until theres nothing but empty clicks from their guns
choppers four meters at your oclock
just before the water envelopes him and plummer
into his mic ive got the prof and the case
first rounds on me back at virginia beach
shane takes a deep breath and pulls himself the professor and the briefcase under the water
shane and the professor rise to the surface as the boat falters behind them
shane pulls out a retractable crossbow
it clicks open and he shoots a cable into the belly of the helicopter above him
shane appears at the pilots door holding the professor
shane addresses the pilot in perfect serbian
you know how to swim
the pilot nods terrified
shane tosses the pilot out
shane swings into the hot seat and grabs the controls pulling the professor in behind him
the seals on the jet skis salute shane in the chopper then disappear gracefully back into the water
shane smiles clearly he loves this kind of day
he looks beside him the professor looks terrified
the professor takes out his mouth piece
oh my god
i cant believe you
that was the most incredible
shane sticks the mouth piece back in the professors mouth shutting him up
better keep that on til we get to the rendezvous point
through the mouth piece why
re the oxygen no
im just not big on chit chat
a pave hawk sh helicopter rotors whirling slowly waits
shanes chopper appears from behind a tree line and sets down atop the mountain by a stream
shane and charles sprint from the chopper towards the waiting hawk
charles stops shane
lieutenant thank you
he pats his briefcase you saved more than just my life today
can i call my wife to let her know im okay
not imperative to the mission
we have to keep moving
i have strict orders to get you out of here safely
im safe lieutenant
she thinks im dead
then dont you have a family
this gets him make it quick
charles picks up his briefcase
he holds the lock up to his mouth and whispers into it joe todd lulu peter tyler
the briefcase pops open
shane looks at him puzzled
its voice activated
designed it myself
i do security thats my specialty
gestures back those guys back there tried to get this case open for five days couldnt crack it
and you should see what happens to you if open it without the code
i have a picture of my kids in here you want to see it
charles takes a cell phone out of the case
shane looks in the case its empty except for the phone and a family photo
charles dials his cell phone
nothing batterys dead
shane considers then hands him his satellite phone
charles dials and talks
honey im alive
shane climbs in the hawk and approaches the cockpit
the pilot sits back to him
were almost ready
just gives us a the pilot slumps forward
shane turns professor run
shane drops knocked unconscious
all goes black
the helicopter is on fire
wolf lies facedown in the stream
he looks around barely conscious
everything is a blur in slow motion
he sees charles unconscious
a huey helicopter lands
a very tall man steps out and takes charles briefcase
there is huge explosion as the chopper ignites
everything is ablaze
shane reaches out grabs the picture of charles kids then goes unconscious
title card month later shane lies in a hospital bed despondent
his arm and face bandaged
shanes captain enters bill fawcett friendly unassuming
he looks like he hasnt slept in days
shane salutes him with his bandaged arm it hurts to salute but he does it anyway
as you were lieutenant
bill sits down beside the bed
he takes a long look at shane
he holds a report in his hand
weve been through a lot together shane
youre the best man i ever trained
and a good friend
i know sir
and i except full responsibility for the missions failure
why the hell did you let him use the satellite phone
he had to call his family
a lapse in judgement on my part that i regret sir
bill shakes his head disappointed
he pulls up a chair and sits opposite shane
plummer was the best security expert the department of defense ever had a genius
he was working on a program that scrambles launch codes
he called it g
guided high altitude scrambling transmitter
one pulse from the ghost satellite and a country cant launch its own nukes
thats what the serbians kidnapped him for but they couldnt get s inside the briefcase
the case was empty sir as i stated in my report
bill considers this
not a surprise really
not like the professor to hide things where someone might look for them
is still out there bill smiles which is why im going to give you another shot
shane sits up
he cant believe his good fortune
appreciate your confidence
invigorated he pulls off bandages disconnects an iv and starts to rise
ill need to put a team together
im gonna need the mini sub i need access to an ep aries spy plane
its not that kind of mission
shane listens intrigued
two days ago i got a call from the professors wife
she told me someone had broken into her home
searched the place top to bottom
the familys scared
whoever killed the professor must think g
is in that house
maybe it is maybe it isnt
either way i need someone to stay at that house and protect them
and while youre there find out if the program is in there
why would you want me for that sir
the professors wife requested you
shane is surprised
bill pulls a tiny tape recorder from his pocket presses play we hear professor plummers voice
honey im alive
listen a lot can happen between here and home if anything happens to me call lt
hes a good man
anyway i should go
ill call you in an hour
i love you
shane is shocked hearing the dead mans voice
you gotta problem with this mission
its just that
ive never been very good with kids sir
not even when i was a kid sir
shane packs his duffel bag
he opens a drawer theres five t shirts identical to the one he wears
he opens another drawer five khaki pants also identical to the one he wears
he opens the closet theres a massive fur collared coat
he rejects it
shane packs his duffel with military gear gps compass night vision goggles camouflage vest machete
they all go in
shane heads to the door then goes back to his chest of drawers
he reaches in and pulls out a small old medal the ribbon is faded and frayed
he looks at it for a moment then unzips his suit and pins it to the inside like its a lucky rabbits foot
a taxi door opens
shane looks like a bad ass ready for anything
he steps from the taxi onto an adorable troll doll on the sidewalk
julies unkempt suburban house with toys all over the lawn and a bless this mess welcome mat
shane double checks the address
the sprinklers go off
shane darts to the door and rings the bell its one of those long cheerful doorbells
we hear tiny feet approach then the door swings open shane looks down and sees lulu peering up at him
shane eyes lulu
lulu eyes shane then mom
theres some weird bald guy at the door
lulu shuts the door in shanes face
we hear heavier footsteps approaching
emale voice o
before she sees shane look if youre with the hare krishnas were not interested
the door opens revealing julie plummer
julie holds naked baby peter
she sees shane and stops a little startled by his size
salutes lieutenant shane wolfe reporting for duty
im so sorry
thank you for coming
she hugs him
hes not quite sure what to do hes a rock he doesnt flinch
come in and meet the rest of the gang
its warm and quiet
petite julie screams up the stairs
shane startles covers his ears
get your butts down here and say hello
and then three pairs of feet come down the stairs
lulu zoe and todd line up like the perfect family portrait
todds hair hangs in his face
he wears a sid vicious shirt and a long trench coat
youve already met lulu
this is peter zoe and todd
kids this is lieutenant wolfe
hes the man who is going to be staying with us for a while
all the kids except for todd hi
shane nods stern
on the stairs a romanian maid walks by carrying a baby
and this is helga and tyler
shane nods hello to them
kids go finish your homework
and ill be checking
zoe lulu and todd climb back up the stairs
julie leads shane into
julie sits shane stands at ease which doesnt look at ease at all
you have a pleasant family maam
charles wasnt around too much
his work took him all over the world
hed be gone six or seven months at a time
so i think for the younger ones its a little confusing
zoe and todd
well theyre dealing like your normal teenagers
maybe in todds case semi normal
plummer i have to tell you that i did everything i could
charles was in a dangerous business
i knew it when i married him
no ones to blame here
beat everyone thinks that charles told me or the kids where he hid it
and until g
is found were all in danger
nothing will happen to your family as long as im here
ive dealt with much
suddenly from behind shanes head a duck appears and nibbles his ear
shane spins in full fight stance
he sees the duck
he was charles
the duck quacks angrily
confused shane returns to at ease keeping one eye on the duck
plummer call me julie
plummer ill go secure the perimeter
im glad youre here
but shane is already gone
shane secures the area
he paces off the yard
he mounts surveillance cameras in the eaves
he attaches contact alarms in the doors and windows
shane climbs a telephone pole opens the circuit box and taps the phones
shane now wearing an ear transmitter crawls through the shrubs hiding electric eyes
nighttime the family eats dinner
we slowly pull out
through the kitchen window
and reveal shane with night vision goggles on scoping the property
the phone rings inside
through the window julie casually answers it
shane touches his ear transmitter and listens as he walks into the house
julie its bill fawcett
i have some potentially good news
what is it
a safety deposit box under charles name was just found in switzerland
i think it could contain ghost
this could all be over
theres a catch
swiss law says only his family can access it
im going to need you on a plane tomorrow morning
shane listening to the conversation enters ill be there
julie and shane share a look
julie with her suitcase shane helga and the kids stand in the doorway
zoe listens to her i pod ignoring the hug julie gives her
dont worry about the kids helga will handle everything
worried but if there is an emergency all the emergency numbers are on the fridge
and on the phone
and on the back door
mom well be fine chill
a little choked up i know its just
i am a mom its my job to worry
i love you guys
im gonna miss you
ill be back in hours
and guys whatever lieutenant wolfe asks you to do
ll the children nod in agreement except zoe who pops her chewing gum bubble
lieutenant i dont want you to worry about anything except the safety of my children
helga will take care of everything else
theyll be safe with me
everything will be fine mrs
julie gets in the car and it drives away
shane turns back to the kids who loom in the doorway
tell me are you licensed to kill
she frowns too bad
helga trudges up the path and in
shane on a short ladder screws in a surveillance camera into the corner of a wall when he hears male voice o
prepare to be annihilated
the sound of machine gun firing
immediately shane leaps off the ladder and bounds down the stairs two at a time and into the
hane rushes in and finds lulu screaming and giggling in front of a video game
shane shakes his head
could you turn that dow and shane spies half of todds face peeking around a corner staring at him
hey todd disappears
shane spins looks around for the crying baby
cant find him
wheres the baby
without looking lulu points
a diapered peter stands in the half full aquarium pouring in cheerios
helga enters holding the wailing tyler
gary suddenly flies by whrrp
shane scowls at helga you run a very loose ship
you dont like it
youre the seal
you do something
i make bottle
elga stomps out
shane heads down the hall when in the corner of his eye he sees a figure scurry across the back lawn
shane turns off the light
he shuts off the window alarm and sneaks out silently
the yard is littered with toys
in the middle is a trampoline
he spots the figure climbing the trellis
shane runs jumps onto the trampoline
he flies in the air and latches onto the figure
they both tumble to the ground
shane yanks off the dark figures hood revealing scott a nervous teenager
hes dazed but alright wearing sharper image night vision goggles
zoe runs out the door setting off the piercing alarm
hes my boyfriend tool
so youre the one who broke in
zoe go back inside
come on scott
shane grabs scott by the scruff of the neck
not with this kid
to todd you gimme twenty
freaked scott fumbles for his wallet and gives shane a twenty dollar bill
i meant push ups
befuddled scott starts to do lame push ups
shane grabs the back of scotts shirt lifting him in the air spinning him away from the house like a marionette
scott runs off calling out from across the street
ill call you zoe
zoe storms inside
shane stands there fuming
the alarms still blaring
the window of the house next door opens a korean couple the chuns pop their heads out
theyre arguing with each other in korean
shane addresses them in perfect korean with subtitles
we had an intruder
a simple misunderstanding
perfect english no accent we speak english kojak
look about the decibel alarm and the kleig lights and stuff
we own a bakery so were up kind of early
would you mind
shane pulls a remote control from his pocket and clicks it
the alarm stops
thanks a bunch
oh and we found this in our pool filter
try to keep that zoo reigned in huh baby sitter
chun tosses him the troll doll and slam their window shut
shanes about to head inside he pulls a tiny camera phone from his pocket and snaps a shot of the chuns car in their driveway
hane marches zoe up the stairs
loud angry rock music blares from todds room
your mother thought you were in real danger
you should have told her the truth
who do you think you are my dad
zoe starts to turn then suddenly spins and tries kicking him in the crotch
but shane catches her foot and whirls her away
she has to hop on one foot to not fall over
he hops her down the hall to her room
let me go
its saturday night
i have plans
zoes back to her door shane flips her foot in the air
zoe falls backwards into the room
shane shuts her door
shane marches back down the hall bangs on todds door lights out
shane frowns continues down the hall
he passes the nursery peter and tylers room where helga is singing a lullaby as annoying has something barney might sing
when youre down and low lower than the floor
and you feel like you aint got a chance
dont make a move til youre in the groove and do the peter panda dance
just hop three times like a kangaroo she does a little dance that goes with the lullaby she hops forwards three times then crab walks sideways
sidestep twice just like the crabs do
three steps forward one step back
the children in bed laugh and laugh
then quick like a turtle lie on your back
riggle like a snake til you cant no more
he wriggles on the floor
then jumps up to their beds
shane shakes his head keeps walking this familys in for a rude awakening
the sun rises over the neighborhood warm orange light
everyone is asleep
in the bedrooms a series of shots tyler snores in his crib
peter in his bed
ulu is surrounded by stuffed animals
odd is out cold motionless
oe is wrapped in blankets
until a trumpet blares reveille
zoe jumps like shes been electrocuted
todd sits up disoriented not understanding whats happening
the whistle gets louder
suddenly his door flies open and shane strides in with a boom box
todd blinks groggily
w what are you doing
youre burning daylight
he squints at a clock and its six a
todd pulls the blanket over his head
shane flips the mattress over spilling todd to the floor
now move it
todd scrambles to his feet and out the door
all the little kids are crying
covering their ears
helga runs through in hair curlers half asleep and angry carrying the crying baby
she curses in romanian hey
not in front of the kids
he gives him a look of disbelief
whats it matter
nobody speaks romanian
usca mi as chilotii pe crucea lu mata
helga narrows her eyes shocked
she curses again in romanian
shanes jaw drops
the children are assembled lined up tallest to shortest
at the end on the floor is baby tyler sucking on a bottle
shane firmly starts his patton speech listen up ladies
your behavior is unacceptable
in order to maintain a state of safety we need to maintain a state of discipline and order
ive only got one rule everything is done my way
no highway option
do you copy
do you copy
i said do you
copying him what
i said do you
do not copy me
make up your mind
shane starts to speak then thinks better hes furious
everyone stares blankly a tense silence
its broken by the sound of a large air bubble from the aquarium
everyone cracks up
shane tries to maintain decorum
he reaches into his bag and unpacks a set of small high tech security bracelets with a red light and a covered button
he straps one to each kids wrist
now that i know i cant trust you
never take them off
the panic button is only for emergencies
touch that you better be dying or youre dead
i am not wearing that
just because my moms paranoid doesnt mean we have to take orders from you
he yells at her marine sergeant style let me explain how the chain of command works
i tell you what to do and you do it
end of chain
now im not gonna have time to learn your names
so you are pointing red red red leader red baby
wait wheres the older male
there were five
mysterious he walks like dracula with footsteps silent like death shane looks to zoe for translation
hes in his room
angry shane bounds up the stairs
hane marches to todds shut door
he tries the knob but its locked
shane bangs hard on it
open this door
shane turns away from the door and donkey kicks it
the wood cracks then crashes inward
the entire frame collapses
hane charges in it didnt have to go down like todd isnt there
down the hall a flush
the bathroom door opens and todd comes sauntering back
he sees shane the destroyed door and wall
all i need is a hammer and some plaster of paris
i can fix this
a piece of the ceiling falls hits shane on the head
can i get by
embarrassed shane steps aside then mutters heres your bracelet
if youd been wearing it this wouldnt have happened
shane snaps it onto todds wrist and head down the hall patrolling
zoe comes up the stairs to her room
she stops at todds door they glare at shane
he has to go
todd nods in agreement
hane does one handed push ups in the living room while the duck watches
with his other hand he loads the photo of the chuns license plate into his laptop computer
his head shifts he hears something suspicious the rumble of a car approaching
he rushes for the front door clicks his alarm remote and opens it just as whack the morning paper connects with his face hard
from off screen we hear a paperboy
shane rubs his nose
lulu screams at the top of her lungs
shane turns to see that peter is chasing her wearing a towel as a sheet
he pretends to be a ghost
stop it peter
lulu hides behind shane
peter booos again
hey hey good soldiers arent afraid of anything
this house is haunted
daddy even said so
he said theres a ghost
and then it hits shane
his eyes light up
and where is this ghost
i dont know
ive never seen it
shane walks slowly down the hall
as he walks he glides his hands along the wall feeling pushing scanning the ceiling
todd and zoe kneel on the stairs
they surreptitiously pour cooking oil all over the wood
then a creak
here he comes
zoe and todd run downstairs and hide behind the couch
shane strides to the top step and raps on the wall
he raps again listening for hollow spaces
shane lifts his left foot out to take a step down
when he hears an alert from his laptop
he goes back to the living room then turns his attention to his laptop
chuns photo appears next to a vehicle registration
shane scans it
todd and zoes faces fall
the footsteps again hes coming back but helga carrying a huge laundry basket appears takes a step onto the stairs bump
she flies down the greased stairs banging her head and ass on each step all the way down
helga hits the bottom with a mighty crash
she screams as laundry flutters down from above
they gulp terrified
bill and julie looking jet lagged sit across a desk from a swiss banker
he seems to be about years old
hes reading a huge stack of paperwork with a magnifying glass mouthing along in french
its taking him a long time
they wait patiently til their patience runs out
as we discussed this is an urgent matter
the banker puts up a finger to shush him
then looks back to the paperwork then licks his finger to turn the page
he licks his finger again but cant get the page to turn
he feebly gets up and shuffles across the room to a water cooler
he fills a paper cup with water and shuffles back to his desk
he dips his finger in the water to turn the page
cant you call somebody
do something to get us around all this paperwork
not in switzerland i cant
bill cant stand it anymore
he jumps to his feet
this is absurd
if we cant get some faster service were going to have to file a complaint
the banker looks at him blankly
another banker marcel enters
je ne comprende pas
to bill and julie im so sorry the chief does not speak english
but i can tell you you will have access to the box tout suite
as soon as your background checks clear
how long is that
helga suitcases in hand heads to the door shane tries to block her path
peters in the aquarium
the duck flies around quacking
red leader remain calm
i am calm
i quit that makes me calm
lets not be hasty
amid the chaos shane moves for the phone
helga takes the opening and runs for the door
he grabs her suitcase
as she tries to wrestle it away shane picks up the receiver
hello sees helga crawling away dont even think about it
the suitcase handle breaks off and helga dashes for the door
shane dives grabbing her foot
he drags her back
covering the phone so julie cant hear the struggle no no everythings fine
youre gonna be gone how much longer
heres a pause the camera dolly zooms as he says it five business days
elgas shoe comes off helga falls forwards and shane falls back against the counter
that is not a problem
just doing my
he picks up his hand that landed on a diaper
helgas at the door
shane body checks it closed
helga struggles to get him off
helga chomps down on shanes hand
things are great
you do what you have to do
shane lets go
helga scampers out the door
take care mrs
shane hangs up the phone as helga makes a dash down the path to a waiting cab
shane chases helga to the cab
i command you to come back
that is a direct order
you cant leave a man behind
helga jumps in the cab
i dont know the peter panda song
as the cab pulls away in the rear window helga glares back then does an obscene romanian hand gesture
his jaw drops in disbelief
he drops his head defeated
then he slowly glances up
the korean couple is staring at him dumbfounded
dont worry if she loves you shell come back
rises takes a deep breath and strides inside
to find the kids are all gloomy
the baby cries
shane awkwardly picks the baby up
okay listen up
theres been a change of plans
your moms not coming back as soon as she thought
worried when is she coming back
in the meantime were just gonna have some more big fun
thats what weve been doing
but tomorrows a school day
i need a signed release for drivers ed
ive got brownies
shane reacts inundated
well take this hill one inch at a time
only then can we rise to the challenge
all for one and one for all
singing be all that you can be
but i appreciate your enthusiasm
tell me that was the duck
we zoom in on the babys leering face
hane quickly moves the baby away from his body
pure self preservation everyone bolts from the room
nobody will help
even peter runs holding his nose
shane enters holding out the baby at full arms length
he lowers tyler onto a changing pad takes a deep breath then pulls out pliers and a screwdriver
using the tools as chopsticks he cautiously unfastens the diaper
and then it flops open
sshane groans repelled
the things i do for my country
shane tries approaching he cant do it
aghast he looks around for a solution
then shane picks up the baby and dips the bottom half in the toilet then flushes over and over and over
shane patrols the hall making sure all the doors and windows are locked
lulu is in her pjs
a hand tugs on shanes shirt he looks down to see lulu
zoe thinks you look like the hulk
i think youre cute
unsure how to respond
lulu doesnt go away she just stares at him it starts making shane uncomfortable
do you know kung fu
did you ever punch someone so hard that their head came off
hane walks away from lulu
shane is again twirling the medal in his fingers
lulu follows at his heels like a puppy
whats that medal for
none of your business
ill trade you a spongebob button for it
shane walks room to room pulling down the shades on every window
is that so people cant hurt us
he bends down to her level and tries to sound sweet i think its time for you take a nappy poo in beddibye land little girl
lulu looks at him like hes an idiot
do i look like im five to you
lulu sulks off to bed and shuts off her light
all the lights are out all the kids asleep
shane breathes a sigh of relief and patrols
the kids are dressed for school
on the table in front of each place is a tan bag
the kids sit down at their designated spots confused by the mres meals ready to eat in front of them
what are you waiting for
todd lulu and zoe all tear open their bags
todd pulls out a bag of corn beef hash and a snickers bar
zoe pulls out a bag of fettuccine alfredo and some matches
lulu takes out a bag of turkey slices and a coffee packet
shane smiles proud of his accomplishment
the kids stare at breakfast dubious
dont worry i can get lots more of those
and ive survived off this stuff for months
like im really gonna eat all those carbs
shane turns to address them okay ladies
your mama is not here to take care of you now
so heres how its gonna be
were gonna pull together all for one one for all
if i say in you stay in if i say out you go out
peter stands in his chair dancing
ba ba do the hokie pokey
i did not say at ease
peters eyes fill with tears
hes only two he doesnt have any idea what youre talking about
i dont have any idea what youre talking about
lulu asks shane can you kill a man with your bare hands
you play too many video games
i can cross my eyes
lulu crosses her eyes at shane then at tyler who screams at the top of his lungs
shane turns to lulu
tyler hates it when i do that
peter starts bawling too
he runs away crying
the table cloth is yanked to the floor
and the phone rings
shane answers trying to hear over the screaming
yes i know its monday
thank you sir
he hangs up
zoe smiles at him innocently
who was that
your vice principal
he said if youre late again you and todd are expelled
he wants to see you in his office
with your legal guardian
the garage door opens dramatically unveiling shane
hes wearing tyler in a snuggle
across his chest hes got a bandoleer of baby bottles and juice boxes
shane cant hide his contempt as he sees julies white minivan
a bumper sticker declares worlds greatest mom
shane puts tyler in a car seat
its interlocking buckle connects four ways
shane fumbles with it for a while
it just doesnt add up
were gonna be late
not on my watch
shane ties the buckles in a fancy knot
the car speeds out of the drive backwards at sixty m
it does a skidding and heads down the street
a big suburban school busses and parents are parked at the curb students of all ages are hurrying inside
the minivan skids completely sideways into a tiny parking spot a death defying perfect parallel park
close up on a stopwatch
it hits zero and at that moment the schools bell rings
holding the stopwatch is the vice principal murney s
hes huge and mean
i always said these kids didnt need a baby sitter they needed a parole officer
looks like mrs
plummer finally listened
he glares at shane and the kids shane sits with tyler in a snuggle holding peter on a harness as he plays on the floor
the kids are seated around him mortified
to shane whats your name son
im in charge of watching these kids for
a few days
murney is unimpressed
aby sitter huh
well whatever work you can get
p in charge of discipline conduct and truancy

principal claire eyeballs him
staring him up and down as he casually holds the three kids

she notices navy seal tattoo on his upper arm
claire sees this and suddenly reacts impressed

shane stares not sure whether to believe
on the spot claire looks nervously around
she lifts her pants leg
revealing a tiny anchor tattoo on her ankle
thats the way i live my life and the way i run my school
cant be too careful
permission to stick around and keep eyes on the kids
just try not to frighten the children
no one will even notice im here
shane dead serious tyler in snuggle is riding the see saw in the schools playground
peter rides on the other side with a group of kids to balance shane
shane types on his laptop claire nelson
a picture of claire in a naval uniform pops up as well as her stats
clean as a whistle
shane closes the computer picks up a pair of binoculars
as shane goes from window to window of the school zoe is glaring at him through the window from her seat in a class
todd sitting in the back row of a class yanks his hood over his head
lulu waves from nd grade delighted
along line of first graders wait for the seesaw
shane stands with his baby snuggle
peter is running in circles around him on his harness like a tether ball
he checks his tracking device
five hundred students eat at long tables
zoe with a group of hip friends turns her back to him embarrassed
todd in line to get lunch does the same
lulu sees shane and waves
shane puts down his binoculars
he turns to the person in front of him with stern intensity
give up now
save us both a world of pain
now last time open the hanger black hawk coming in
reveal shane is talking to tyler in his safety seat trying to get him to eat
beside shane peter is destroying a sandwich with animal crackers
open in t minus three two one
tyler gurgles ignoring him
principal claire sits next to shane with her lunch tray
what would you say is the secret with kids mr
show no weakness
ill drink to that
she toasts with milk

when you agreed to serve your country i bet you didnt know youd be serving creamed bananas to one year olds huh
shane gives her a look
principal claire smiles
hey i out rank you you know
not here you dont
youre on dry land lieutenant
she looks at his chair well not so dry where youre sitting i guess
shane sees that tyler is pouring his juice box all over shanes pants
he yanks tyler away from him
tyler starts to cry but shane stops him from crying by making a funny face
dont take this personally but youre pretty good at this
seriously im impressed
a whole day and all three plummers stayed out of trouble
suddenly theres a huge crash around the corner and the sound of students in an uproar
shane hands tyler off to the principal and leaps over the table
students are in a ring cheering as four students in wrestling jackets hold todd
one reaches down and gives todd a wedgy then another wrestler punches him
todd slips out of their hold and decks the wrestler
vp murney is watching but not stopping it
zoe in the crowd cheers todd on kick his butt todd
shane and claire push through the students
as soon as they see the principal the crowd freezes
who started this
then vice principal murney steps forward
todd started a fight with five students at once
shane turns to todd and punches fists with him impressed
the kids mixed up
look at him
if i catch anyone on the team fighting again next weeks tournament is off
i dont care who starts it
murney smirks and gives her a ill handle it wink

personally i think thats a little harsh
boysll be boys
low to todd scept for plummer here
todd lunges at him
shane effortlessly grabs todd and judo flips him todd lands on his feet sticking the landing
no one is more ssurprised than todd and shane
nice moves man
the bell rings the crowd breaks up
murney approaches shane
pretty slick frogman im a black belt myself
swhy they asked me to coach the wrestling team
murney makes a loud kung fu cry and throws a punch stopping an inch from shanes head
shane doesnt flinch
see total control
maybe you could stop by practice wed show the boys how a couple of pros do it what do you say
come on promise ill go easy on you
im on duty
i forgot you had to baby sit
maybe some other time then
shane puts an arm over todds shoulder
todd shakes him off and heads to class
murney snickers to claire looks like pretty boy theres all bark and no bite
dont even think it murney
hed kill you so fast i wouldnt even have time to get my camera
shane looks exhausted
peter is asleep in his shoulder tyler is crying as he keeps watch
the principal strolls up
another day another dollar twenty minus taxes
arent you gonna change him
id love to for one wholl eat and not cry
thats not what i mean lt
then shane smells what she means tylers diaper is full
shane recoils in disgust holding tyler out like a grenade
oh change him
panicked he pushes tyler towards the principal
not my job
instructions are right on the box
bathrooms down the hall
just then an alarm in his jacket goes off
he looks at his tracker its flashing red red
shane hands off peter and tyler to the principal
shane runs down the hall following his tracking device
it leads him to a door
he bursts though it doing a shoulder roll
nd graders are sitting on the floor
lulu is in front of the class with the panic button in her hand
the board reads show and tell
shane lands in fight stance the class applauds
next to lulu is a very upstaged little boy with a frog
lulu sticks her tongue out at him
my nanny can kick your nannys butt
shane is furious but the final bell rings
at that moment his tracker alarm sounds again
he looks close up on the tracker screen two dots labeled red and red are heading away from the school fast
shane runs with lulu through the mob of kids
he hands her to the principal
shane dives into the minivan
the dots on the tracker are headed north
he speeds away after them
the blinking dots on his tracker are side by side racing down the road ahead of shane
they make a sharp right
shane makes a right almost tipping the minivan
he blasts through a red light
he turns a corner a plywood wall surrounds the site
he leaps out of the minivan
he looks at the tracker zoe and todd are dead ahead through the fence
two big construction workers are standing on the other side of the plywood wall shane kicks out one entire section and charges through
what hell do you think youre doing
he turns around to see several construction workers all brandishing tools
tell me where the kids are and ill let you all live
buddy youre about to get a beat down
three workers rush him
shane easily takes them out
the remaining workers give shane a scared look then run
he catches his breath then checks his tracker
todd and zoes beeps are coming from a manhole
shane pries off the manhole cover
he looks down
in the manhole its dark and dank
shane lowers himself down
shane lands shoulder deep in disgusting sludge
he winces then checks the tracker the dots are close feet away
shane trudges through the river of muck
the dots beep louder
hes almost there
he splashes around a corner then gasps he sees the blinking lights below the surface
he takes a deep breath and dives under
he comes up for air with zoe and todds homing beacons
a note is tied to them ha
principal claire sits with the kids in the living room
from outside they hear the front door open and the sound of ominous squishy footsteps
then the door swings open revealing shane looking like a swamp creature
everyone gasps then covers their noses
a cute young cop enters behind shane
zoe fixes her hair
the cop looks at them
year old male weird hair
year old female
into his radio cancel that a
the cop turns to shane with a smirk
in the future use our nonemergency number
thats the one to call if nobodys fleein or bleedin
the cop leaves zoe checks him out as he goes
shane are you okay
eerily calm just fine thank you
covering her nose
the smell is bad
i should probably get going then
if you need anymore help
she practically gags as she passes him
shane looks around at scott and zoe he doesnt say anything but with his hand he makes a my eyes on you gesture
shane is in the shower
he pours an entire bottle of shampoo over himself
shane burns his clothes in the barbecue
tyler is in a high chair peter rocks in a cradle swing
shane enters in just a towel
he sees on the fridge helgas shopping list all junk food
he looks at it cringing in disgust before he notices sitting around the table are lulus entire brownie troop a dozen little girls in uniforms theyre staring at him
the brownies applaud and whistle
shane covers up and leaps into the family room pulling lulu after him
who are those people
its my troop its monday
monday wednesday and saturday are troop nights
get rid of them
everybodys parents go out on troop nights
they wont be home til ten
moms our den mother
lulu starts to sniffle close to tears
tonight were supposed to sell cookies
selling cookies isnt imperative to my mission
we have to
if we dont sell enough cookies we cant go the jamboree and if we cant go to the jamboree
whispers come on shane
you gotta help me out
they already think im a loser
and its not like i have any other friends cause mom never lets me out of her sight
lulus about to burst into tears
shane back in uniform paces in front of the brownie troop
they are assembled at attention indian style
heres how its gonna be
tonight im gonna be your den commander
that means if you want to live to see tomorrow do as i say
do we the brownies stare art him in stunned silence
im scared of you
now wait here
the brownies are in the living room unpacking boxes of cookies getting ready to go
zoes on the phone
yeah hes a total psycho
i think mom found him from one of those tough love boot camps or something
shane blows passed her revving a cordless power drill
various shots as shane uses the drill to seal every window and door
hes not just locking them hes shanes finishing up the last window
this is totally cruel and unusual
you cant do this we could run out of air
shane lifts her window so its open a half inch then drills it into place
shane ushers the troop out the door then loads peter and tyler into two snuggles one attached to his front the other to his back
shane closes the front door and attaches a club lock to it
shane loads the brownies and toddlers into the minivan
as the minivan pulls out of the driveway the camera cranes up to
inside zoe picks up the phone hits speed dial
hes got us on lock down its like oz or something
no not munchkin oz hbo oz
she listens hm
i dunno if thats a good idea scott
shane pulls the minivan into the crowded parking lot the brownies are all singing bottles of beer on the wall at the top of their lungs
shane double snuggled helps the brownies set up a card table to display their cookies
i gotta get supplies
i can see you through the window but if anything happens
flashing her bracelet i know
shane watches the brownies on the stores closed circuit monitor as he pushes a cart into the store
he looks around at the bright colorful boxes of childrens cereals rainbow fruit roll ups snack packs
nothing looks familiar nothing even looks like food
he sees a huge pack value case of spam
tyler looks at him what are you nuts
the brownies are trying to sell the cookies but theyre very shy
shoppers blow passed them without even noticing them
one of the brownies spots something
slow motion in a shot out of reservoir dogs we see who she means a group of bad ass chubby cub scouts
theyre headed straight towards the cookie table menacingly
to another scout hey skeever whats stinky and floats til you flush em
the scouts cackle
the ugly scout yanks a box of cookies away from lulu
he rips it open dumping the cookies on the ground and grinding uthem with his foot
this is troop territory
how are we supposed to sell raffle tickets when this place reeks of your skanky cookies
beat it before i get my face punching badge on you
the brownies take off running clutching their boxes
one of the scouts grabs lulu she tugs and tugs but cant get away
finally the cub scout takes her scarf
he laughs and lets her go
the cub scouts high five
shane heads to the brownies table but lulu and the brownies are gone
in their place are the chubby scouts
where are my troops
i havent seen anybody you skeever
you wanna buy a raffle ticket
were trying to win
around his neck shanes monitor starts beeping
shane takes off running in the direction of the signal
shane runs up to the minivan
the brownies are huddled behind it trembling
no one answers well
those boys over there broke our cookies
shane eyes the cub scouts
dead serious well then im afraid i have to eliminate them
if i dont come back avenge my death
he heads toward the scouts
the brownies scream
he bends down and points at lulus panic button
he firmly tells lulu whos close to tears this is not a toy
im here to protect you
get in the car were going home
you cant take us home yet youre supposed to take us to dinner
an extreme cu of the chuck e
he wears braces and head gear which causes him to lisp
welcome to chuck e
screaming children everywhere
on stage the chuck e
cheese automaton band jams
i wish i were in chechnya
brownies are running around playing video games and skee ball
shanes watching peter in the plastic ball pool while he holds tyler in the snuggle
the manager approaches shane
anything elsh i can do for you
in a big glass he shows him this much ice
this much cyanide
the manager laughs but the headgear seems to hurt his face when he smiles
how bout a re fill on that pischer of mischer pibb
gesturing pischer of mischer pibb
frustrated the manager picks up a pitcher and exits
lulu approaches she grabs shane by the sleeve and drags him over to the stand up mortal kombat game
im watching your brother
i pressed two player
i thought you liked combat
unless youre scared
shane doesnt like the sound of that
he steps up to the machine
he cracks his knuckles stretches
then he takes a joy stick
he checks over his shoulder peters happily splashing about in the plastic balls
on the screen they each select a fighter
lulu picks a small female character
shane picks a man who looks like shane
they begin lulu screams out with her fighter in unison prepare to be annihilated
she leaps over shane in a somersault and throws a dozen throwing stars
then kicks him in the head repeatedly
thats not fair
nobody can jump thirty feet
the hulk can
that wasnt a documentary
the second round starts brownies have gathered around to watch
lulus fighter does a series of kicks
shane cant even get one punch in she pins him to the ground kneels on his head then kicks him in the face
shane is taking it really seriously
hes really mad
this isnt fair
my joysticks broken
you wanna switch
they switch sides
round three starts
lulus fighter picks up shanes in the air spins her then cracks her in half over his knee
and then a kick in the face
re the snuggle you dont have a baby on your chest
lulus having fun now shes just avoiding shanes fighter dancing jumping while he pounds the buttons swinging and missing
shanes really fuming
youre not even trying
come on take a shot
oops too slow
swing and a miss
she keeps dancing
its really annoying
shanes working the joy stick hard slamming buttons but he cant hit her
he is kod
she does a very obnoxious victory dance
in your face
i am the greatest hand to hand combat champion in the entire world
shane screams and rips the joystick off the machine
shane looks around to see if the staff noticed
he and the brownies sneak away leaving the sizzling machine its joystick dangling by its wires
zoes on the phone the zhouse is quiet
mom stop worrying
im a mom its my job to worry
seriously everythings cool
the guys just a control freak
its only a few more days
i hate leaving you but you know i have to do this
i love you
dont worry were okay
tonight im just doing homework in my cell
as zoe hangs up we widen out the house is packed with teenagers theyre keeping quiet until the phone is in its cradle then the teenage dj starts the music
zoe looks around at the mess
she turns to scott who doesnt seem concerned at all
dude this is outta hand
who are all these people
jus ma peeps
and the folks who read my
zoe rolls her eyes then notices a weird sweaty kid whos throwing mustard covered baloney slices at the ceiling where they stick with a satisfying squish
dude not cool
various shots the plummer house its a huge party the place is jammed kids everywhere
teenagers come and go through the kitchens doggy door
shane tyler in snuggle loads brownies into the minivan counting them
barking at them like marines move move move
shane drives the brownies are singing bottles
suddenly a look of horror comes across shanes face
he spins the minivan in a and floors it
shane tyler in snuggle bursts in the brownies follow
we see what he forgot peter still happily playing in the pool of plastic balls
the manager is watching him
i figured youd come back for him they almost always do
inexcusable to leave a man behind like that
relax we once found a kid in the ball pool when we opened in the morning shane wades into the ball pool and pulls peter out which is fine except
that hes missing his diaper
not okay freestyling in the ball pool not okay
he holds his breath and goes down for the diaper
he disappears under the balls for a long time
the manager and the brownies share a concerned look
hes still down there
should we send someone in after him
he surfaces gasping
hes holding the diaper out away from him
he charges across the room with the diaper
go go go
and he bursts out the other doors at a full run
shane is exhausted as he pulls up in the minivan
he gets out and groans in disbelief
its insanity hip hop blasts gyrating teenagers everywhere chugging drinks making out peeing in the bushes jocks throwing footballs
reeling shane takes lulu peter and tyler up the path
he protectively guides them past the craziness until a football suddenly whizzes by
outraged shane snatches it mid air then crushes the ball
hane gives a blood curdling stare
the jocks flinch scared then run
shane unlocks the club lock off the door
inside is worse a total wreck
zoes dancing with scott
shane drags the needle across a record at the d
everyone recoils from the horrible sound
no one leaves until this house is spotless
i want to be able to eat off the floor
hell i wanna be able to eat in the kitchen
nervous glances then everybody suddenly runs for the back
shane is confused trying to understand
then he intuitively dashes past them
hes scoping the surroundings
the doggy door
scott is halfway through the doggy door when shane grabs his ankles and yanks him back in
shane holds scott upsidedown by his ankles
oh no you dont
now were gonna do this my way no highway option
just then a mustard soaked baloney slice drops from the ceiling sticking to the top of shanes head
shanes eyes narrow he takes it off trying to maintain his dignity
start swabbing ladies
he hands scott the mop
scott gulps and starts mopping
miserable teens scrub
in a bathroom scott and zoe in playtex gloves furiously clean
scott scrubs the toilet with pinesol as the duck swims in the top of the toilet
this is officially the worst party ever
it was your idea
i dont even know most of these losers
shane inspects the house as kids clean
shane wipes a finger down the sofa
he lifts the sofa and rubs his finger under it
he holds it up to a kid
the kid quickly starts cleaning again
a girl reorganizes a stack of cds
shane goes over them straightening then he notices something
he pulls out a cd it is a home burned disk labeled with a sharpie
it reads ghost
oh my god
two dark clad figures watch through binoculars
they see shane find the cd and walk out of sight
shane quickly tucks the cd into his pocket
a long line of exhausted party goers files out
scotts the last one to leave
shane works his way through the house
its spotless counter tops glisten furniture polished
it looks like better homes and gardens
he heads upstairs
zoe blows past him into the bathroom where she throws up
shane sits down outside the bathroom door
thanks a lot rambo
my friends will never come here again
those people arent your friends
they show no respect for you or your house
because you have no respect for yourself
i do too respect myself
ueasy she pukes again
shane hands her a handkerchief
you got barf on your tank top
announces company downstairs
he walks down the hall zpounding on doors
youre not my dad
lulu and todd step into the hall
zoe gets up shaky and furious and screams in shanes face
we hate you you hate us
youre like a robot
why dont you just leave us alone
lulus crying todd picks her up
shane stands helpless
after a beat
youre right red
im not the man for this job
in all my years i have never been treated with such disrespect
not even from the enemy
dont worry as soon as your mom comes back im gone
suddenly the power goes out
sighs tired its scott
talking doesnt do any good
go to your rooms
suddenly two ninjas all in black burst in through the window
shane spins in fight stance
to the kids go
terrified zoe and todd scoop up the kids and rush down the hall
the ninjas pull a retractable kendo staffs
wielding them with great skill
it takes all of shanes skill to fend them off the three fight close quarters and fast
until shane pulls down attics spring loaded folding ladder and clocks a ninja with it
he goes down but shane is shocked from behind by the other ninja
the ninjas attack fiercely theyre good
their kendo staffs hiss with a powerful electric current
the ninjas knock shane backwards down the stairs
ghost hand it over
they leap down after him pounding him with their staffs knocking him into
there are toys everywhere like a tornado hit a toys r us
shane fends the ninjas off
he spots a baseball bat and grabs it facing them fiercely
they step back
okay who wants some
shane swings the bat down on a ninjas head its a whiffle bat it makes a silly thunk
shane and the ninja share a surprised look then the ninjas charge
shane fends them off with his whiffle bat
with his foot he picks up a fisher price corn popper and uses them both to fend off blows
it rattles and pops as he fights with both toys until a ninja breaks them with one blow
shane sees a farmer john talking game
he jumps up onto a shelf and grabs it
he pulls the string and swings the plastic disk like a deadly bolo
the rooster goes
whack he hits a ninja in the head
he swings the farmer john like a bull whip until a ninja knocks the shelf over
shane crashes down toys fly several furbies hit the floor
they echo the fight ow
shane sees the ninjas are wearing only ninja socks no shoes
he grabs a barrel of legos and flings them all over the floor
the ninjas move towards him the legos and jacks dig into their feet
the ninjas fight as they hobble around avoiding legos shane runs to the changing table then violently squeezes desitin at a ninja blinding him
shane hangs in the doorway and swings at them kicking a ninja in the chest
the ninja crashes through the window
he other ninja looks up fearful
suddenly he grabs a bottle of baby powder
he sprays it in shanes face
the room fills with a cloud of white
he squints blinded
the cloud dissipates
and shane sees hes now alone
he runs to the broken window
the ninjas are long gone
shane bangs the window sill disappointed to have lost them
composing himself shane approaches zoes door
he quietly knocks
you can open up
a long pause then the door creaks open
the kids run out and hug shane with all their strength bawling
todd and zoe enter terrified
shane isnt sure what to do
then he hugs peter and lulu
he really hugs them
please dont leave us shane
im not going anywhere
he hugs them even zoe is crying and hugging shane
im sorry for giving you a hard time
who were they
what did they want
theyre looking for a program that your father invented
so moms not paranoid
there really are people out to get us
he takes out the cd labeled ghost
theyre not after you
they want this
but nothings gonna happen to you as long as im here
and im not going anywhere
the kids shudder relieved
they hug him tighter
he looks zoe eye to eye
he dries her tears but i cant do this without your help okay
we need a little more cooperation here
the kids nod tell you what lets start over
from now on you listen to me and do what i say
to zoe and todd and i

zoe and todd nod
shane offers his hand to shake
they shake then they hug him too
shane and the kids sit around shanes computer
shane slips the ghost cd in the disc drive pushes play cmon cmon cmon
the sound comes on its music
and then picture demi moore and patrick swayze at a pottery wheel
shane is furious a long pause
zoe laughs she cant help it its been a long night
then the other kids join in
soon even shane is laughing too the telephone rings they all jump startled
zoe answers it all smiles she tries to play it cool and not frighten her mother hey mom were fine absolutely nothing happened you should worry about
shane takes the phone
two men tried to get into the house tonight
oh my god

theyre gone everyones fine
they were looking for ghost but they didnt find it

well yes and no
we found something in the box
but were not sure what it is
bill thinks its part of the ghost
it looks like some kind of key
we just dont know what its for
she holds up the strange metal two pronged key
the good news is ill be home in two days as soon as the customs paperwork clears
very genuine so soon
we were just starting to have fun
dont worry well be just fine
early morning students run in to school
the minivan pulls up and shane emerges with the five kids
i gotta warn you guys from now on im gonna be sticking even closer
the teacher shows the children how to dye easter eggs
angle on lulu making a mess of an egg
angle on shane squashed at a little desk
he dips an egg in some purple dye
an obstacle course with cones
zoe nervously drives a small sedan a crazed teacher next to her
he is gesticulating screaming reacting each time she hits the gas then brakes hits the gas then brakes
shane stands off to the side shaking his head
peter and tyler are tight in their snuggles
the teacher hangs a series of cute turkey hand drawings above the blackboard the kind where your fingers make the feathers
she hangs one of a huge hand and smiles at shane who sits in the back sunglasses on
shane nods yeah i know its good
will shane wolfe please report to vice principal murney in the gym
lulus classmates all chant in unison ooooooooh
youre in trouble
zoe sits in a folding chair mortified
she is holding a broken off side view mirror
murney stands principal claire next to him
they look concerned
so she wrecked a drivers ed
car shell pay for the damage
lady drivers what do you expect
no its not that its the boy
i mean todd
shane gives zoe a look
ordinarily i would wait for his mother to return
but im a bit concerned and im not sure what to do
has he been skipping class
he does always miss sixth period
murney calls into the hallway
shane stops in shock todds long hair is all shaved off he now has a bleach blonde buzz cut giving him a skinhead look
this is how he showed up to practice
and thats not all
i was doing a little re con in his locker
and i found this murney hands shane a book and shane flips through it
its a book of photographs of nazi uniforms
if hed had hustler or something boys will be boys but this is just sick
hes not a nazi
its certainly not normal
pulls shane aside
see if you can talk to the boy
find out whats going on
shane shakes his head todd is worse than he thought
todd and zoe stand to go and shane walks them out
the wrestling team is assembled stretching
they snicker and shake their heads at todd as he passes
shane walks the kids out and murney chases after him
hope you wont go light on him that whole familys no good if you ask me
ill talk to him
youre a good man shane
bet youre a hell of a fighter on the mats huh
shane ignores him and keeps walking
maybe sometime we oughta strap up well give these boys a treat
he fake punches one of his boys who flinches like murney has maybe hurt him a couple times
another time maybe
its a date then
ill show you a couple moves
i promise i wont hurt you
shane walks away
without warning murney lets out a kung fu scream and leaps at shane kicking him in the back shane trips forwards to his knees
murney tells his team see that
you never know when your adversary is going to strike
did you kick me in the back
is there a footprint on my jacket
shane dusts off his back and leaves
come on frogman
dont be a sissy
shane turns back
it looks like shane might fight but instead he takes a deep breath and leaves
murney shakes his head and snickers to his team
the minivan pulls up with shane and all the plummers piled in
shane parks todd runs towards the house
shane holds todd back by the arm
wait todd i want to talk to you
odd yanks his arm away and runs into the house
shane knocks on todds door
the window is wide open shane checks his window alarm theres a refrigerator magnet stuck to it keeping the contact so the alarm didnt go off
shane looks out the window far down the block he can see todd running around the corner
shane hops out the window
he sees zoe peering out her window
zoe youre in charge
if anyone gets within forty clicks of the perimeter signal me
keep all doors sealed do your homework preheat the oven and make sure lulu brushes her teeth
he starts to shut the window but the duck leaps up on the sill
you want in or out
the duck leaps out
shane screws the window shut
on the corner shane sees todd climbing on to a city bus
shane picks a girls bicycle up off the front lawn
its pink with a flowered basket
its small for him but he hops on and pedals furiously after the bus
shane on the girl bike pedals after the bus
a few homeboys watch him pass curiously
he nods back tough
the bus stops in a rundown neighborhood todd hops off the bus
shanes arrives a moment later dripping sweat
he stashes the bike behind a mailbox
at the entrance to the old warehouse todd meets up with three other teenage boys theyre dressed in brown hitler youth uniforms they head inside
shane follows them stealthily
shane follows the hitler youth into a large room set up with folding chairs
he hides in a dark corner
todd and the hitler youth enter and take seats
a creepy man in a scarf walks out and stands in front of them
shane watches as the man addresses the hitler youth
all my nazis are finally here
okay i want all of you at attention
the nazis stand at attention
shane is horrified
and on stage left he yells von trapps
i need my von trapps
as a group of blonde actors all dressed in lederhosen as the singing von trapp family enter and join the nazis
theres also a few nuns a captain von trapp and a maria
the creepy man is in fact a good natured slightly foppish director
starting from where we left off gimme rolf and liesl lets give you are sixteen a run up der flagpole
todd heads up to the stage the director arranges him and the actress playing liesl ish into position
an accompanist begins on piano todd sings remarkably well you wait little girl on an empty stage for fate to turn the light on your life little girl is an
empty page that men will want to write on
to write on
you are sixteen going on seventeen
shane bursts into laughter
his whole face lights up for the first time ever
todd and liesl dance
todd is good but nervous
he attempts a spinning kick but he slips and hits the stage clutching his ankle
he gets up and limps to the seats
the director walks onto the stage upset
he looks up to heaven baby jesus have i done some unspeakable evil that i deserve to be saddled with the worlds worst production of sound of music
he shouts at the cast we open in a week
the sets not finished
the cast is a bunch of clumsy goats every kick ball change would make bob fosse dig himself out of the earth so he could have a heart attack again
ill get it right
none of you will ever get it right
which is why i quit
he throws down his script
the cast is stunned
and with that he exits stage right
and on his own cue
he exits stage right in a huff
the entire cast looks to todd fuming
shane jumps up from his hiding place startling everybody
everyone steps back
todd is terrified
shane kneels down beside todd
he closes his eyes and begins rubbing his hands together like mr
you gonna fix him
my hands are freezing
shane grabs todds ankle hard and unceremoniously cracks it and yanks him to his feet
im not going to quit
i hate wresting
todd shuts up would you listen just once
look i dont know a hell of a lot about this kinda stuff but
a lot to learn but with hard work discipline you could make a go of this
but what about murney
that guys an idiot
todd smiles relieved
they sit on the edge of the stage
sound of music is a great show
my dad took me to see it when i was a kid
shane smiles wistfully
you dont seem like the musical type
julie andrews was hot
girlsll think im
weird or something
you know what girls think is weird
men in leotards pinning each other to the floor
ive never understood that
chicks dig guys who can dance
doesnt matter now anyway
shane looks at the cast they look pretty glum as they pack up their costumes
todd looks devastated only a moment after shane saw him happier than ever
shane straightens up grabbing todd by the shirt collar
everyone looks around theyre not sure what to do
off shanes glare they quickly assemble on stage
theres some mumbling
liesl chimes in
we dont have a director
shane shakes his head
i have directed rescue missions in afghanistan
ive directed numerous snatch and grabs in countries whos names you are not allowed to know
i have choreographed multi pronged amphibious landings and stealth air attacks
full of bravado do you think i have the stomach to whip this production into shape or not
todd looks up at shane
shanes patrolling the hallway
he hears zoe in her room breaking something angrily
he peeks in just as zoe throws her cell phone into the wall furious
i called him in his room another girl picked up the phone
i know its no big deal
i dont know why i let it get to me
i dont see what you see in this guy
its just nice to think someones thinking about you you know
he nods it wont happen again
what are you gonna do
youre not gonna hurt him are you
promise you wont touch him
i wont touch him
he turns out the light
shane tucks lulu into bed
tell me a story
shane looks at her surprised
he sits on the bed
then he starts okay
once there was a family of elves
one day the little elf family uh
went into the magic forest
to find a secret gnome
facility where gnomes where turning mushrooms into
the elves had to go in and take it out
they were ordered to
by the elf unit commander at elf station bravo
so they waited for cloud cover and they came in from the north
as shane finishes the story he illustrates setting up the scene with dolls on lulus floor
the elf team decided on an l ambush so three elves formed a base leg and laid down a heavy suppressive fire on the gnomes while the others maneuvered around
to the right flank and walked through finishing off anything left alive
i mean standing
d shanes really into the story
lulus fallen asleep
shanes eyes are brimming with tears as he finishes and not one elf got left behind that day
we got em all
even the teeniest little elf of all rodriquez
then from across the hall peter wails
todd pops his head in the door
you have to do the panda dance
or he wont stop
i cant remember that thing
ill write it down for you
the wails get louder and louder
shane sighs and whispers to peter reading from todds notes when youre down and low lower than the floor
and you aint got a chance
dont make a move til youre in the groove and do the panda dance
peter starts bawling
shane doesnt know whats wrong
todd calls from the doorway
you have to do the dance
like dad used to do
he made it up for him
he sings again mortified
he does the dance as he sings
shane hops forward three times
just hop three times like a kangaroo sidestep twice just like the crabs do
humiliated shane crab walks sideways
take three steps forward and one step back
chun gets his paper shane tyler in the snuggle hands out bag lunches as the kids load into the minivan
shane turns and catches mr
what are you looking at
todd sits in the back of the minivan listening to sound of music on his walkman lulu is next to him with her gameboy zoe and peter are half asleep
shane climbs into the passenger seat
zoe realizes hes staring at her through the mirror
today you drive
the kids sit bolt upright
they turn to zoe terrified
she gets out in shock and gets in the drivers seat
the other kids seat belts click loudly
but i cant even pass drivers ed
have you given a driving lesson before
ot in a car no
but its a lot like a bradley assault vehicle
especially when zoes driving
the kids share a dubious look
zoe backs jerkily out
zoe is super tense as they drive
shane is nervous but trying not to show it
lulu and todd are terrified
do you know what causes most accidents
the most important thing is that you keep an absolute focus on
zoes looking right at him not the road
dont look at me
he minivan brakes abruptly at a red light just as a semi screams through the intersection
shane is shaky
you wanna drive
i trust you
zoe is surprised
she pulls out jerkily
zoe pulls to the curb almost tapping a buss rear fender
shane unclenches his teeth
next lesson hours
and the other kids all bolt from the car terrified
lulu makes a big show of kissing the ground
ha ha ha
hey head into the school
shane spots something
another angle reveals scott zoes boyfriend with a few friends laughing being obnoxious
shane jumps out of the car
before scott knows whats happened shanes lifted him in the air by his backpack
i know ways to hurt a man without touching him
broken promises lead to broken legs
do we understand each other
scott nods trembling
shane lets him down and heads into school
shane peter in lap tyler in snuggle keeps an eye on the kids at their tables
kids boisterously run past
suddenly claire barks out
the kids instantly freeze
claire strides into view
shes wearing a cute dress and a little make up
a long severe stare now
chastened the kids gulp and orderly march away
shanes eyes alight impressed
im glad i never had you for a co
she coyly smiles ive noticed improvement in your troops lately too
noon and none of them have been called to my office
its a miracle
he sits beside him and offers him a milk
buy you a drink sailor
hey eat in silence
shane s not so good at small talk
shes waiting for him to say
you look nice today
this old thing
well you never know who youre going to run into
he smiles back
suddenly theres a commotion murney is marching todd towards them dragging him by the ear
principal claire sighs not again
in one move shane leaps over the table
principal claire watches him leap love it when he does that
murney shoves todd forward
ive had it
i just caught this boy dancing under the bleachers like some kind of bavarian fruitcake
murney gets up in shanes face
i want this freak outta my school and into treatment
somebody needs to give this punk a talking to
im right here
veryone is shocked that todd talked back
a hushed whisper goes through the cafeteria
murney turns around
you got something to say
yeah i do
i quit murney
a hushed oooh goes through the students
winners never quit boy
whatre you so scared of freak
the students snicker
todd looks intimidated
then i am not scared
i want to sing
no ones sure they heard him right
todd pulls out a stack of sound of music flyers and hands them out
todd is on the poster in his rolf costume
principal claire takes one she laughs now it all makes sense
im in sound of music
it opens friday
youre blowing off wrestling for a musical
to shane this is what happens when theres no man in the house
there is a man in my house me
murney turns lets get one thing clear
im not quitting cause i hate wresting
im quitting because youre a bad coach
the whole team wants to quit
im the only one with the guts to do it
urney looks over at the team
they look to the ground sheepishly todds telling the truth
murney looks around humiliated furious so youre a tough guy now
murney takes one step towards todd shane steps between them protecting him
stay out of this baby sitter
murney glares at him face to face
so calm its scary
you said you wanted to wrestle
lets do it
everyone is watching
murney did not expect to be called out
his voice cracks then he regains his calm after school
your ass is mine
he storms out
there is a stunned moment and then a mob of students and a lot of cute girls swarm todd taking flyers
shane gives todd a proud thumbs up
a quick series of shots of students whispering to other students passing notes a kid opens a note it reads murneys getting his ass kicked
the bleachers are packed
murney struts out onto the mat
the two fighters begin circling one another
the wrestlers scream for murney
todd cheers shane on
on youre about to enter murneys house of pain
ill be sure to lock up when im through
murney roars and charges shane
shane defensively uses murneys momentum to flip him halfway across the mat
murney lands on his back
the wrestlers mouths drop
murney shocked climbs to his feet and charges again shane side steps and sweeps murney sending him right into the wall hard
murney bounds to his feet rushes shane
shane dives over murney grabs onto murneys waist
shanes momentum pulls murney backwards bam
murneys shoulders hit the mat with shane smiling down on him
todd flops to the mat raises his hand and slaps it down pinned
shane throws an arm around todd and they head out
the wrestling team huddles around murney whos quietly twitching on the ground mumbling something
is he okay
dislocated nerve thats all
hell be fine in checking his watch two months
that was awesome
they walk out
the crowd cheers
shane smiles at her as he passes
she gives him a thumbs up
to todd lets go todd
i got my troops waiting
shane marches the brownies through a forest
he wears peter and tyler in front and rear snuggles
if youre ever lost in the woods the first thing you have to do is find a source of drinking water
and make sure its potable
if youre not sure boil it for thirty minutes
the girls are loving it fascinated
you have to eat right
well let me tell you youre not gonna find girl scout cookies out here
no brownies either
a lot of roots are edible
so is some tree bark
when i halod into rwanda i lived off the underground fern stem for three weeks
shane kicks over a rock
underneath are crawling bugs
they look nasty but theyre full of nutrients that may save your life
he scoops up some bugs and eats them
hes eating roly polies
the brownies are frozen in shock
mouth full of bugs wots of pwotien
upbeat music kicks in over the following montage shane leads the brownie troop through combat exercises
in unison the girls punch kick
punch punch kick
shanes got tylers cradle next to him in between punches in perfect tempo he reaches out and rocks it
the duck watches all this fascinated
the lot is empty
shane and zoe sit in the minivan shane holds a stopwatch
he signals her she burns rubber and races through a slalom of orange cones she hits every one the wheel hubs are clogged with cones
she skids to a stop just short of the severe tire damage spikes
shane changes tylers diaper with one hand
in his other hand hes reading the brownie handbook
its open to a page that reads knot tying
the cast is assembled on stage where shane has set up a scale model of the set on the floor
he illustrates the stage directions by moving around toy army men okay well put von trapps here here and
here at the top of the stairs
now the nazis are gonna come in this way and the von trapp is set
he laughs at his own joke
the kids dont get it
zoe leaps into the minivan through the windows
zoe peels out and weaves the cones
she only clips one it teeters but doesnt fall
shane gives her a signal she throws it in reverse and drives the course backwards
lulu in her brownie uniform ties a complicated knot we widen to see shes tying shanes hands behind his back as the brownie troop watches
and then begins wriggling free
they watch closely
shane and zoe are huddled under the minivans dashboard
shanes showing her the ignition wires
shane has the brownies assembled
hes attached sofa cushions to himself
the brownies attack mercilessly
shane changes tylers diaper rapid speed
hands a blur
todd and liesl work on the you are sixteen dance
your life little girl is an empty page that men will want to write on
odd tries the spinning kick but blows it landing hard
shane blows a whistle
why dont we just let the nazis win tonight huh
from the top think of yourself as a gazelle prancing over the plains
todd tries the kick
shane blows the whistle
at the end of peters crib shane performs the panda dance
singing and doing all the moves hes got it down adding a james brown flourish now and then
dont touch that dial sleep for a while heaaay
and say good night peter panda
he does a spin kick
then he tucks peter in
good night peter
going to sleep good night daddy
shane is so touched he almost bursts into tears
he kisses peter on the forehead
im not your daddy peter
but sweet dreams
the brownies sit at their cookie table beside the door
across the lot the chubby cub scouts at their own table see them
the scouts head towards the brownies
hey skeever whats in a girl scouts pants when she has diarrhea
he stops short the brownies have moved into a formation ready to strike lulu at the front its kind of scary
go away and we wont hurt you
the scouts share a look they laugh
the head scout steps forward and grabs lulus cookies
in one move she spins out of the way and pulls off his neckerchief
he grabs the neckerchief but like lightning she wraps it around his arm tying him
she shoves a cookie in his mouth
youre gonna have to pay for that
the scout struggles the other scouts are scared
let go mommy
she lets him go in a flip he lands on the ground hard
lulu lets out another kia
the girls move forward in unison striking a cool pose
shane shops wearing the double snuggle
as hes comparing prices he sees on the security monitor the brownies attacking the cub scouts
he smiles proud
thats my troop
the cub scouts have all been tied with their own bandanas to the cart corral
shane comes out of the store and catches lulu using his catchphrase
from now on you do things our way no highway option
the scouts nod terrified
shane gives her a stern look then laughs
the brownies joyously chant a march
i dont care what has been said brownies rock
full speed ahead
give me guff im in your face
brownies rule the human race
one two three four
shane works his way down the hall checking on the kids
lulus room lulu is asleep
todds room the door is open shane peers in
todd has a switchblade
he is practicing with it clicking it open tossing it hand to hand
off shanes look west side story auditions in two weeks
shane takes the switch blade and performs an amazing trick with it spinning sit like a pro
its all in the wrist
he heads down to zoes room and peaks in shes not in bed
he rushes in but shes out on
zoe sits on the railing she seems sad
im not gonna jump
i dont know what you did but hes really straightened up
flowers phone calls
ive never been in love like this before
how long you been together
thats longer than any relationship ive ever had
youre okay shane
im not used to anyone giving me the benefit of the doubt
my teachers dont trust me
my dad didnt care about us he was never here
interrupts her stern hey
your father cared about you very deeply
he told me you were the greatest things in his life
that whats bothering you
cause we can talk about it if you want
zoes eye well up then she cries
shane holds her
i miss him so much
shane is a little taken by surprise
then he decides to answer
he takes his sfathers medal out of his pocket
this was my dads
he was the only family i ever had
mom left when i was little cause dad was always gone
two years in
an indisclosable locale
another six in
another indisclosable locale
i didnt really have a home so i went to military school then one day my mom got the letter
no more dad
he looks at the medal
i always wanted to be just like him
im starting to realize i never really knew him
i dont know if im like him or not
thats horrible shane
the hardest part was living without any details
i always wondered if he thought about me
so how did you get through it
you could say i just shut down my emotions
i turned off all feelings and dedicated myself to becoming the perfect soldier
i never even got to say good bye
a tear runs down zoes face
she throws her arms around shane
the phone rings
shane answers it
ulies on the other end
the red tape is cleared up were on the first plane in the morning
zoe runs down the hall telling the family mommys coming home
mommys coming home
everyone wakes up happy sleepy
excited the kids are all abuzz talking excitedly
hes left alone
the house is dark
shane sits in a lawn chair scoping the area with night vision goggles on
gary sits in the next chair
shane sighs morosely
just another assignment
no reason for personal attachments
shane takes a sip out of a juice box
he pets the duck
hey gary your wings arent clipped
how come you dont fly away
i guess youve got it good
kids to play with
three squares a day
he duck stares unblinking
all quiet on the western front
i guess i better fix that playroom window
hane turns the light on
gary follows shane as he looks for tool
suddenly the duck starts quacking
garys foot is caught in a grate
what happened gary
shane gets down on his hands and knees and gently pries garys foot from the grate
shane is about to stand when something below catches his eye
shane pulls out a pen flashlight shines it down the grate
we see a crank wheel
what do you suppose this is
shane tugs at the grate until it pops off
shane grips the valve and tries turning it
he tries harder muscles rippling and then it gives
the wheel spins
he floor opens revealing a circular staircase leading below the garage
shane steps down it
theres a small room and a hall leading to a steel door
its solid and inscrutable
no hinges or cracks
the only break in its surface is a strange two pronged keyhole
shane looks on stunned
shanes at the steel door
he has high tech tools laid out in front of him
hes been trying unsuccessfully to crack the lock all night
the kids are watching his progress lulu hands him a tool
shane dials a phone
we pan up from the white us gov license plates to bill at the wheel
julie sits beside him
bills cell phone rings he answers it
i think i found bill reacts excited
do you have it
its in a steel vault
ive been trying all night cant crack it sir
remaining calm good
okay dont do anything further
well be there shortly dont do anything til i get there
shane smiles pleased and hangs up
then we slowly move up
away from shane
towards the neighbors house
e push into the house
through a window
revealing the korean neighbors standing in the dark
silently spying on shane
an ominous pause
one things for sure
after we turn this in to my co whoevers been bothering you guys wont be bothering you anymore
everyone reacts happily relieved
except for lulu
she looks stricken
whats wrong lulu
you should be happy
but shane does that mean youll have to go
he goes silent
tongue tied he has no answer
you guys better get ready
your mom should be home soon
bills sedan pulls up
julie and bill hop out
julie opens the door comes into the dark hall
bill is carrying her suitcases
i had a fight with zoe when i left so they probably trashed the place
she trails off
they listen they hear in the next room kids singing a beautiful a capella version of the hills are alive with the sound of music
she turns on the lights what she sees makes her drop her luggage in shock
the house is spotless
the rug is vacuumed
the fish tank is clear filled with healthy singing a capella with songs they have sung for a thousand years
dumb struck julie goes to the
the kitchen is sparkling clean no dishes in the sink
she sees attached to the fridge with magnets a flyer for sound of music featuring todd
julie almost faints
bill steadies her
she staggers to
shane and the kids are holding up a home made sign welcome home mom
todd pushes stop on a cd player the sound of music stops
zoe is in a conservative dress todd a button down and khakis barely recognizable
lulu has bows in her hair
peter is fresh faced smiling tyler is asleep a picture perfect family
welcome home mom
julie starts bawling
the kids rush forward and hug her
across the room shane sees bill enter
shane stiffens and salutes proudly
he smiles wryly then salutes back good job lieutenant
shane leads bill inside
bill holds the pronged key
im really proud of you shane
im giving you your choice of assignment anywhere you want
you just name it
thats kind of you sir
pause but ill have to think about it
bill stops surprised
shane continues a bit reluctant
sir all ive never known is the military
at nine years old my father put me in cadet school and from there i never looked back
dont get me wrong i wouldnt trade it for anything and i have no regrets
i should hope not
but being with these kids has made me feel like theres more to life than taking out your enemy
and i think i want to explore that some more
suddenly an angry voice
shane and bill spin startled
the chuns strides up give us the key
they checked out ands up
compliant shane puts his hands behind his head
he takes a submissive position
chun comes closer reaching for bills key
shane shoots bill a glance
shane spins and grabs both guns
he whacks the koreans forearms while slamming their heads together
hane takes control
he smiles relishing a second of glory when suddenly crack
a third gun butts him in the head
he turns startled and starts to fall
disoriented confused he looks up as he drops
he is losing consciousness
things are spinning
arguing with bill you promised us ghost months ago
im sorry mr
there were delays
shane peers in confusion then passes out
julie and the kids are on the floor tied up
peter and tyler are caged in the play pen
peter has a juice box
the korean man mr
chun secures the room closing the window shades
bill checks the knots binding the children
they whimper scared
he wont be baby sitting you anymore
he gags the kids
julie glares livid
i trusted you
charles trusted you
so did the department of defense
north korea pays better
chun keep an eye on them
you with me
bill gags julie
the kids are furious
bill and mrs
shane lies unconscious
bill and mrs
chun approach the steel door
bill inserts the two pronged key
and it clicks
the door hums then slides open
inside is a dark corridor
light is at the end
they anxiously tiptoe reaching
spare bright and white
the floor is covered with square tiles
at the far end is a large elevated safe
beside the safe is a red switch with two settings armed and disarmed
its set on armed
the air is filled with an ominous low pitched hum like a monstrous computer
bill eyes the safe
you bring your stethoscope
but ive got some c
she confidently strides toward the safe which sets off hidden flame throwers in the walls
a jet blast of flame shoots out
she leaps back just in time but the shoulder of her jacket is on fire
bill pats out the flames with his own jacket
chun is bokay just missing both eyebrows
charles never made things easy
chuns eyebrows are neatly completely singed off
chun guards the kids eyeballing them icily
lulu looks scared
but behind her back we reveal her hands untying her ropes
freed she hits her panic button
lulu grins hopefully shanes coming
chun pulls the tracker from his pocket
think im stupid
now stop bothering me
lulu frowns then leans back against zoe
with a rapid blur of finger work she unties zoe
then needing a distraction she signals tyler and crosses her eyes
tyler gasps horrified and screams his lungs out
chun spins startled and lulu quickly rolls across the room
she lands against todd quickly assuming a fake bound position as if she hadnt moved
chun whirls the kids look innocent
chun is confused for a second wasnt he tied to the other one
behind todd lulu frantically unties todds ropes its gonna be close
skeptical he steps closer
he leans down to look at todds ropes z now peter
peter squirts juice into mr
the kids use the distraction todd pops to his feet then leaps into his spin kick it connects with mr
all the kids bounce up
they untie julie then scoop up peter and tyler
chun growls and starts to stagger up
lulu lands in karate stance and calls out hi ya
the other kids take off mr
chun looks at lulu
chun laughs thats cute
ham without warning lulu sweeps mr
chuns leg he drops to his knees in pain then when hes at her level she kicks him right in the nuts
chun tries to grab her by the wrist but lulu evades with her cool snake like move
lulu runs slamming the door behind her
chun gets up and turns the doorknob but the door wont budge
zoe shoves a chair between the door and the opposite wall theyre trapped inside
chun punches the door making a small hole
he reaches out to knock the chair away but he cant quite reach
he puts his face up to the hole hes made
todds outside with a fire extinguisher he blasts mrs
chun falls back from the door his face coated in white
he yells out furious
that stuff doesnt hurt
he sticks his face out the hole
donnggg todd hits him square in the face with the fire extinguisher itself
the family comes scrambling out but as julie exits a hand suddenly grabs her
bill lurches into view clutching her
the kids are horrified
they start to run back but she urgently gestures keep going
go get help
the kids fret unsure then nod and run to the side garage
zoe and todd load the kids into the minivan
bill pulls julie inside
chun listens to mr
chun on the radio speaking in korean theyre headed for the car
relax ive got the keys theyre not going anywhere
sparks fly as zoe hot wires the minivan
she floors it
chun comes racing around the house as screeeech
the van suddenly floors out almost clipping him
chun falls as the van peels backwards down the driveway and s
it shifts into drive and roars away
chun hops into bills car and races after them
zoe floors it
what are we doing
lets look for a cop
the sedan guns its engine gaining on them
oe runs a yellow
she hits the curb and goes airborne
the kids scream as they sail through the intersection
the sedan keeps chasing
bill has julie at gunpoint leading her to the secret door
they step past shanes body lying on the concrete
how does it work
how does what work
dont play dumb
its getting old
i want to know how to get through the booby traps
whats the code
i dont know any code charles didnt tell me about the room
if i knew charles had hidden it so well i wouldnt have killed him so soon
dont make me kill you too
julie gasps chilled
then a crackling of static
chun exits the vault holding a military radio
bill my husband has question i have a clean shot at their tires
its risky they might wreck
julie goes frantic emotional
bill dont hurt the kids
surprised everyone looks down
they look over shane is standing in the doorway
i know the code
ill get you in
just please dont hurt anyone
ill eyes him
the men stare down bill deciding if he can trust him
then he clicks talk on the radio
change of plan
bring them back unharmed
bill uncuffs shane
the vehicles race chun just inches from the kids tail
he tries to pass them on the right
its like a chariot race chun zooming by half on the sidewalk to cut them off
todd scrambles into the back seat
he does something we cant see as zoe drives
whats taking you
dont wait for me
the sedan pulls up beside them
zoe makes a very lewd gesture at him
it throws mr
chun off for a beat
zoe floors it mr
chun is now face to face with todd who throws a dirty diaper into the his face
chun swerves and almost wrecks
lulu starts pelting mr
chun with debris milk cartons crayons orange peels
hey rubbish clobbers him
chun rolls up his window then pounds the gas
about to pass
zoe looks over
chun is pointing a gun
she suddenly pulls the emergency brake
the van spins into a squealing
chun screams disoriented and loses control
in the van peter laughs
the van spins madly
the sedan skids and plows into a store window
the kids cheer triumphant
shane scopes out the vault
the walls and ceilings are covered with high tech weaponry
chun holds julie
bill waits impatiently
shane is figuring his options
anybody got any perfume
a bewildered beat then julie pulls out a tube of binaca
shane squirts it revealing in the mist a myriad of crisscrossing laser beams
shane steps forward
he speaks aloud confidently
zoe todd lulu peter tyler
bill reacts puzzled
the key is the kids names
shane steps forward zap
the floor tile shocks him sending him flying backwards
shane gets up in pain
you think this is a game
that was the code
i saw plummer use it on his briefcase
code or no code go get it now
ill cocks his gun
sweat drips down shanes face
he mists the air to see the beams he steps forward over one beam and ducking under another he miscalculates a burst of flame blazes from the ceiling like a
giant blow torch shane leaps back landing on his hands and knees
to bill you cant make him do this he doesnt have a chance
he notices a groove carved in the floor not quite centered to the room
he feels the groove
something she said
thinking havent got a chance
shane feels the groove in the floor
he looks up at the ceiling bottom of the first floor
sings softly to himself when youre down and low lower than the floor
and you havent got a chance
dont make a move til youre in the groove and do the peter panda dance
shane laughs sharply
thats the code
he shares a look with julie
bill and julie share a look they have no idea what hes laughing about
calmness comes to shanes face
he takes a deep breath facing forwards just hop three times like a kangaroo he hops forwards three times fearlessly
no booby traps are set off
sidestep twice just like the crabs do
he steps sideway across two tiles
again nothing happens
it dawns on julie what hes doing
julie smiles relieved
shane he steps forwards then back three steps forward and one step back
when he steps back a spring loaded spike launches down from the ceiling imbedding itself where he was standing
shane is rattled his focus gone
until julie shouts shane snaps out of it and flops down on his back just in time flames shoot from both walls right at him
if hed been standing hed be toast
the minivan blasts through another yellow
look out zoe
there is a police car cruising the street ahead of them
zoe blows past it
inside is the cute cop
the squad cars lights flash on and he catches up with the minivan it takes a while theyre flying
use the gas not the brake
zoe slows down so the police car can pull up beside her
the cute cop shouts over at zoe
id say you could lose your license but you havent got one
people are trying to kill us
they have my mom and our bodyguard you have to follow me
just pull over
dont follow me
she swerves into the squad car almost running it off the road
zoe u turns and speeds back towards her house
the squad car turns around and chases her
the minivan speeds by
the squad car is on its tail
it is joined by more squad cars
following the chase at a safe distance is mr
chun in his now wrecked sedan
murney and claire are watching a soccer game
hes in a that baloney bandit struck again
i accept full responsibility
my intelligence proved to be faulty but if i had more resources
she shakes her head suddenly the minivan speeds by
then the police car chases by
then not that surprised i told you not to pass her in drivers ed
claire frowns concerned
shane is on the floor sliding forward nervously
wriggle like a snake til you cant no more
then better jump quick like there aint no floor
shane jumps up just as the floor under him drops away revealing a pool of liquid
shane has wedged himself in the corner
a bead of his sweat falls into the liquid and sizzles in a cloud of smoke
to himself to calm down almost done almost done
just hold your breath and jump to the left
he jumps to the left of the hole
he lands in front of the safe
hes relieved then nozzles spray yellow gas at him
he holds his breath just in time
still holding his breath and thats the peter panda dance
he flips the switch to disarmed
the safes red light turns green
immediately the flamethrowers and blowguns retract
the gas gets sucked into grates
the whole room goes silent
bill looks around
he nervously steps forward he waves his hand over the floor and jumps back
bill signals for mrs
chun to go first
she gestures back you go
its a stand off
finally bill takes a breath and walks across the room
the booby traps are disarmed
chun follows pulling julie along
thank you shane
you were always my best man
i knew youd figure it out
shane scowls disgusted
you know if youre willing to join up id be happy to cut you in on the proceeds
what do you say we make a good team
i was devoted to you sir
and you betrayed all of that
all that we stand for
ill take that as a no
bill turns to the safe
he starts to reach for the dial
then catches himself
somethings not right
i think you better open it
shane reaches for the safe before he reaches the dial wait
thats just what you want isnt it
bill thinks trying to read shanes poker face
bill gestures to mrs
you open it
chun doesnt budge
oh come on
i walked the floor first
chun reaches out and touches the dial
she turns it and zappppp
volts electrocutes her her hair on end shaking from the voltage
bill is off guard shane kicks his gun away
the gun skids into the acid and plunges sizzling
bill is incensed but shane gazes coldly
there will be no mercy
full of himself bill lunges
and hes strong
he shoves shane back then punches him in the gut
shane glares then returns an onslaught of blows
shanes fury is unleashed a volley of attacks hitting bills arms head legs
hes crazed unrelenting
but suddenly mrs
chun leaps onto his back
she screams and grabs his throat
shane struggles to lose her
suddenly he drops and flips her
she catapults stumbles backwards across the room and stops just inches from the acid
she teeters tottering unable to gain her balance
shane shakes his head then runs to grab her outstretched hand
she smiles saved
but hes unforgiving
shane cold cocks her knocking her out
bill is charging him
shane whirls delivering a roundhouse kick
bill gets slammed in the chest
bill tumbles the wind knocked out of him
he jumps to his feet delivering a series of hard punches which shane deflects they tangle like pros
its clear the both have the same training
they punch spin kick connecting only occasionally
bill wheels around and lands a kicks squarely in shanes chest
shane tumbles landing on his back in front of the safe
he steps over shane
leering mercilessly he jabs the spike against shanes throat
any last words
shane narrows his eyes then whispers sings
say good night peter panda
a bell rings and the safe door flies open
slamming bill in the head
bills collapses and drops
the minivan races toward the house
the police cars chase after sirens wailing
in the van everyone is screaming
youre going too fast
youre not gonna have enough time to stop hey im the one in drivers ed
i think i know what im doing
she squeals into the driveway then brakes
but its too late
the van skids smoke burning from the tires and hits a tree
the kid spill out and run
the lead police car screeches to a stop
police leap from the car
shane and julie stare at each other then look in the safe inside the cavernous metal box holds but one object a tiny computer chip
shane gently removes it
they look in silence
she smiles at shane grateful
thank you shane
its finally over
now we can go back to our peaceful
then a sudden amplified voice from behind them total commotion
the kids clamber from the van with their hands raised
cops surround them
even peter and tyler have their little hands over their heads
the garage door raises shane steps out
what are you doing to these kids
cops cover shane and julie julie and shane freeze
i said freeze
zoe youre in a lot of trouble
driving without a license
traffics violations cutting him off these kids are heroes
they just aided in exposing a high level espionage ring
i suggest you call the fbi
the cops are unsure what to do
you expect me to believe any of that
suddenly a crazed scream
chun stands inside the gate pointing a rocket launcher
hes disheveled and manic
the cops freeze helpless
shane weighs his not so many options
nobody is sure what to do
but then a woman suddenly flips over the fence vaults onto chun and knocks him out with a karate chop
claire lands on her feet triumphant
even chun is amazed as he turns his head shane spins and grabs the rocket launcher
he breaks into a big grin
she proudly smiles back at him
this chaos is unsolvable
beaten he reaches for his radio
i think ill call the fbi
agents swarm the area
bill and the chuns are being hauled away in cuffs
julie huddles with the kids
shane talks with an f
that was nice work
youre a one man battalion
just doing my job
the bureau is always looking for good men
do you have a card or something
the agent hands him a business card then walks off
shane examines it swelling with pride
the kids are looking around watching the fbi agents work
lulu is following one of the fbi agents around
do you have to wear that thing in your ear all the time
does it itch
zoe is looking at the safe
she sees fallen onto the floor from the safe a letter
her siblings and julie notice and gather around
zoe reads the letter if youre reading this then julie found the key
julie tyler peter zoe todd lulu i want to say i love you more than anything
i always have
a tear comes to her eye
the plummers hug each other
claire walks up to shane
what happens now
youll be stationed somewhere else right
i guess theres no more reason for you to stick around here
shane looks at her
he looks around at the family
he looks at claire
im kinda re conning the situation here
and to tell the truth
i dont see anything but reasons to stay
whats the next move
shane smiles slyly and pulls her close
i dont know
im on dry land
youre the superior office

summers almost here
what if you and me did a little amphibious recon mission
on say maui
sir yes sir
the plummers all approach interrupting
zoe gives them a look that makes shane and claire blush
lulu turns to shane sad
this is it
your work here is through
guess you have to go now
she puts out her hand to shake his
ah come here you
he surprises her with a bear hug he hugs the whole family at once squeezing them off the ground
he puts them down
before he goes he reaches down and gives zoe his medal
he squeezes her hand around it
he wouldve wanted me to give it to someone i care about
like he did
love you shane
this is too much
he wipes his face
your dad would be so proud
shane bawls he cant keep it in
he starts to head off lulu calls after him shane were never gonna see you again
what are you talking about
im gonna see you friday night
a long beat
julie looks up baffled
whats friday night
close on shane tonight is the night we trained for and failure is not an option
no detail is too small
we are the best
remember your lines hit your marks and stay in character
i expect perfection
he grins now lets break a leg
wider reveals the cast of the sound of music
shanes military march version of the musical
nuns sing how do you solve a problem like maria
the von trapp kids perform so long farewell
in the audience julie watches in astonishment
she is surrounded by her children
scott in a suit his hair combed claire dressed to the nines the little brownie troop even murney
lulu has a basket in her lap inside gary the duck and his new family the most adorable ducklings you ever saw
they all watch rapt
you are sixteen begins
shane watches with bated breath
in slow motion he leaps into the spin kick
its fantastic a michael jordan dunk
the audience goes nuts shane stands and shouts yesss
and an armed forces huu ah
the audience stares at him until he sits back down beaming with pride
finally climb every mountain
hearts swell as the family crosses the papier mache alps
a standing ovation
the performers take their curtain calls then giddily gesture shane to come out
he humbly steps into view and the house goes crazy
a cellophane bouquet of flowers gets thrust on him
shane smiles touched
