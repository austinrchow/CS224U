richards james flamberg story by john c
richards shooting script final a tense surgery in progress
meters flicker instruments flash in the bright overhead light
in the midst of it all stands dr
the master of his domain
ravell leans forward so a nurse can mop the sweat from his brow as he completes a last delicate procedure
his co workers sigh collectively with relief
surgeon close her up will you
ravell comes out of surgery clearly exhausted
without his surgical mask he is ruggedly handsome
two nurses follow attending him like a fighter fresh from the ring chloe raven haired and striking and jasmine an exotic mix of african american and asian
blake daniels the silver haired chief surgeon rushes up the corridor
on his heels is dr
lonnie is also conspicuously handsome but hell always be second to david
the look on blakes face stops david in his tracks
theres been a train crash near santa barbara
theyre flying an aortal trauma here now
how can i ask you this david
david rubs his eyes
thinks about it
i can do it blake
his bravery isnt lost on the two nurses although chloe exchanges a quick covert glance with lonnie
is he crazy jasmine
hes been on his feet for fourteen hours
chloe its been this way since leslie died
losing himself in his work poor thing
ill give you something to lose yourself in
excuse me miss
quaint midwestern eatery
knick knacks and photos abound
the booths and counter are packed with locals
a family dining section off in one corner
two guys sitting at the counter in team jackets
the older of the two holds up his empty coffee cup
but his waitress standing a couple seats down from him doesnt move
shes completely absorbed in watching the soap opera that plays on two battered fuzzy tv sets
betty sizemore has a wholesome attractiveness that competes with a bit too much makeup and a cheesy white waitress uniform
two other waitresses attend to customers behind her
the younger of the two guys is involved in the soap opera
but the older one still wants coffee
he gestures toward betty
betty leans forward grabs the coffee pot and moves in front of him
without taking her eyes from the tv she pours the java which somehow lands in his cup without spilling a drop
contd very impressive
that is very
turning to others did anybody see that
the local guys around him dont even bother to look up
of course theyve seen it before
contd thank you
could i bother you for a little more
before he can even finish betty is topping him off with milk
tears open an equal and half a pack if i remember correct
the older gentlemans mouth works a bit but nothing comes out
he is flabbergasted by her attention to detail
she looks at the younger man who is still following the show and gobbling down a huge bacon burger
betty contd you know youre never too young to start on a lean meat substitute
you wanna try some turkey bacon on that
you want a tip when im through
its your body
betty turns back to change pots
the older man watches her intently as the younger of the two mumbles to himself
to himself thats right so why dont you get up off it
to betty ive told him the same thing
thanks for the suggestion
betty flashes the men a winning smile and moves off one eye always on the tv as she approaches two local types
sheriff elden ballard a short tightly wound little man sitting at his own booth
ballard is spit and polish all the way creases in his shirt a glossy shine on his shoes
badge proudly displayed
he sits with
roy ostrey a gangly bookish local reporter
betty drops five ketchup packets and four mayonnaise packets on the table for him
youre looking good
thanks roy youre sweet
a big liar but sweet
i liked your editorial this morning
oh appreciate it
i was trying to ahh give a sense of history to
interrupting yeah it was great
really put the whole idea of church bake sales in perspective
you know elden some people actually read more than just the classifieds
why dont you go back to doing something youre good at
like that lonelyhearts column
chuckles to himself ill take a refill there betty
his cup is full before he can even finish the sentence
oh you know the usual
keeping the world safe
i meant your food
i thought you said the eggs werent
mind your own meal
you should get the order you want
and you should keep your nose out of another mans omelette
to betty its no big deal betty
theres yolks in there huh
its no prob
gotta keep you on track
betty grabs ballards plate without another word gives him a reassuring rub on the shoulders and moves off
he smiles appreciatively after her then turns on roy
why you always gotta embarrass me
i been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me
theyre just eggs elden how embarrassing can eggs be
plenty who eats eggs for lunch anyhow
mind your own business
you just said that shit so you could look at her a little longer anyway
still carrying ballards plate she returns to the counter
come on guys i told you its egg whites only for the sheriff
quietly i put him in that zone thing
well it better be a pretty good size zone if hes in it
betty and the cooks share a quick laugh
they move to change his order while betty glances up at the tv
lonnie catches up to blake in the corridor
blake i can handle that transplant
we need someone with the right kind of experience lonnie
even if hes falling asleep on his feet
lonnie its a complex procedure
why dont you observe
im not some snot nosed resident fresh out of medical school blake
no youre not
youre a good doctor lonnie but youre not david ravell
ive made my decision
now if youll excuse me
the camera moves in to hold on a closeup of lonnies face as he simmers in anger
plates of food are piling up on the shelf in front of the cooks
one of them turns the tv off by remote
we were watching that
the other girlsve got orders up
were not one a them goddamn nelson families yknow
betty snatches up several plates to help out
ballards food appears with a clatter of porcelain
yeah well we aint one a them neither
go on now
when you gonna get those things fixed anyhow
when you all quit watching em for a living
frustrated betty delivers several plates and drops them at tables where the people know her by name
she moves off toward four local guys in a booth jangling their empty cups
betty weaves her way over to them and pours refills
when a hand strays around to touch her ass she pushes it away with her foot and keeps right on pouring
absently betty takes a look around the restaurant
the other waitresses are gone and no one is behind the grill
alarmed she pushes through the double doors into the kitchen
three waitresses along with the dishwasher and two cooks are standing in a row waiting for her
alright i get it no more tv
no one moves then darlene leads them in a huge surprise
they produce a life size cardboard cut out of dr
david ravell who looks dashing in his green hospital scrubs
betty backs up in disbelief
betty contd oh my gosh this is so embarrassing
where did you ever find this
on the goddamn internet where else
nope got him at t
hunks with sweet little asses
seventy five dollars
seventy eight fifty
everyone looks at him
well i paid for the damn thing i oughta know
pose with him
betty laughs and puts her arm around the cardboard man
a flash photo is taken
a cupcake with a single candle is placed in her hands
uh oh youre getting up there
doesnt david like em young
im over the hill what can i say
darlene gives betty an envelope with cash showing
a little something for those nursing classes youve been wanting to take
but keep putting off thanks to a certain husband we wont mention
oh guys you didnt have to do that
so how you gonna celebrate
del takin you into wichita for a big fancy dinner
the others laugh they know better
so does betty
yeah dairy queen maybe
oh i should probably call him
thanks you guys
alright alright come on
im not running no bed breakfast we got customers
smiling betty grabs a wall phone as the others mingle about
the trailer office of a small time car dealership
as the phone rings the camera pans across pictures of del sizemore dressed as napoleon caesar and abe lincoln arms raised in a high energy sales pitch
the phone rings again
we see a framed certificate of achievement from general motors dated
after the third ring an answering machine clicks on
dels voice hello there
youve reached sizemore motors home of the best selection of used general motors cars in the big springs fair oaks area
we cant come to the phone right now cause were out making a sale so leave us a message better yet come on down and steal one a these beauties
right out from under us
coffees always on
hi del its me
i guess youre busy
dels very busy
hes on the rented sofa in the trailers lounge screwing his secretary joyce
but as he rocks the couch hes listening to bettys message
i know you want the oldsmobile back tonight so
i was wondering if i could take one of the new buicks
del pulls out and lurches across the room
he reaches for the desk phone but misses spilling down onto the carpet
he gathers himself and his pants up in disgust pawing around the desktop until he finds the phone
so call me when you whoa whoa whoa
hang on a second there baby
why do you need one of the new buicks
oh youre there
you sound out of breath
i ran back in to get the phone
the answering machine is on so their voices are booming
the phone cord is stretched across the trailer as he tries to get back to joyce
he motions for her to join him but she remains where she is fuming
i dont need one but its kind of a special night and whats so special about it
joyce looks at del incredulous
then pissed off
he signals to hold on
sue anns taking me out and i thought it might be fun to go in a nice car
joyce wriggles to a sitting position and begins to pull up her panties
del shoots her a look that says im not finished yet
they pantomime frantically back and forth until joyce throws him the finger and slams out the door
what was that
its ahh busy here
look you dont need a lesabre to go out with sue ann
take the blue corsica
ill see you when i get home
he throws the phone onto the cradle then bangs on a window to get joyces attention as she fires up a smoke
through the pane shit
joyce open the damn gate will you
as del zips up his pants joyce trudges across the lot to bring in the closed for lunch sign and open the gate
del silently studies the much nicer car lot next door for a moment
he takes in the banners the signs etc
del contd thats what we need some goddamn flags
betty enters the office
joyce is on the phone
she looks up irritated and says something under her breath to the caller
uhh no we havent picked a date yet
well once he dumps her we will
to betty hes out pricing banners
i dont expect him back
you know flags and shit
he said for a livelier look or something
betty nods and swaps her car keys for a set joyce gives her
joyce contd s too bad about the lesabres
theyre a really sweet ride
as joyce prattles on betty notices the buick lesabre keys on a rack behind her
she sidles around joyce deftly removes a set from the hook and drops them in her purse
she smiles and starts to wave goodbye as joyce puts her call on hold
joyce contd need something else
no i was just
how you doing
job satisfaction i guess
hows things at the tip top
you miss it
you must be joking
so del get that car he sold you up and running yet
oh yeah hes got things up and running alright
back to phone anyway im thinking easter cause i just fucking love pastels
she whispers then laughs loudly as betty leaves
the cardboard doctor is standing next to bettys olds
she thinks about leaving him but picks him up and tosses him into a blue corsica
he lands with his face against the passenger window
she stands for a moment by the corsica dangling the lesabre keys before her eyes
suddenly she jumps inside the chevrolet and slams the door
the blue corsica leaves the parking lot and pulls onto the street
the car makes an abrupt turn into a trailer park directly behind the car lot and glides to a halt behind a row of battered airstreams
betty gets outs of the chevy and looks back the handsome face of doctor david ravell is staring at her from the car
oh christ what am i gonna do with you
she goes back to pick him up then starts off
a row of cheap trailers on both sides of a crumbling driveway
betty appears with her cardboard man tucked under one arm and then disappears behind a pickup truck
she tosses the cardboard david over a concrete slab wall climbs over herself and walks straight to the lesabres
her key opens the last one maroon
she puts the doctor on the passenger seat gets in the car and inhales the new car smell
joyce can be seen inside the trailer still talking on the phone
she misses the whole scene as she works on her nails
we deserve this
betty has the car at m
on the rural kansas roads wheat fields for miles on both sides of her
the radio is blasting bonnie raitt and shes singing along
she sees her speed and punches the accelerator
she turns the radio up louder
when she approaches a sign saying you are leaving kansas betty suddenly becomes self conscious
she eases up on the gas
does a u turn and heads back toward fair oaks
she glances wistfully in her rear view mirror at the billboard that quickly fades into the distance
betty enters a modest residential neighborhood and pulls into a driveway
she parks in a detached garage and looks over at the cardboard david
theres no way hes going in the house
she puts him in the trunk and closes the garage door
she walks several houses down
on her way to the door we hear a dog barking children and general commotion from inside
sue ann rogers answers bettys knock
her hair is matted with sweat as she struggles with children ages and months
suddenly sue ann is hit by an errant rubber ball
sorry got my own little gulf war going on here
betty takes the baby as sue ann pulls a videotape from a shelf
its all one move they do this every day
did you watch it yet
ill tell you if that man was any better looking itd be a crime a some sort
hey i got a surprise for tonight
were going to the starlite in style
oh betty ill give you a hint
if you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a jaguar
honey im really sorry i was gonna call you about tonight
larrys got a lodge meeting
theres no way i can get a sitter this fast
what about your sister
i cant ask her again nathan stop it
jesse dont take that hit back
i feel terrible hon
after a beat
its all right
maybe next week we could
no well do it later
s only a birthday right
ill have another one next year
betty forces a smile kisses the baby and hands it back to sue ann who hands her the videotape
so what color is it
i stole it
he wasnt going to let us use it so i just took it
oh i wish we could just get in it and drive and drive and drive
yeah me too
i gotta go make dinner
betty throws her a look as sue ann closes the door
betty turns around frustrated
she starts yanking her apron off as she crosses the street
a low end ranch
a worn out sofa and loveseat form an l that dominates the living room
romance novels line a small bookcase
six canaries in cages chatter away in the kitchen
del sits at the dining room table agitated
he is presently attacking a pork chop baked beans and a loaf of wonderbread
all we hear is a fork clicking and birds chirping
betty stands at the breakfast counter barefoot still in her uniform and quietly eating a salad
sure you dont want any salad
no i do not want any goddamn
what was all that shit on the phone about the new buicks
i told you
sue ann was gonna take me out tonight but
shes not comfortable in a corsica
s got air and leather
i took the blue corsica del
all right then
actually im glad youre going out
i got something going on tonight
some serious clients with real potential
del belches smiles then clucks at the birds nearby
like the water purifiers
or the vitamins
del almost comes out of his chair pointing his finger at her
hey the fda screwed me on that when they changed the law and you know it
anyway least i try shit still got some dreams left
youre a goddamn waitress what do you got
i got you del
well then you aint got much
oh i know
so whore these clients
couple a guys in from outta town
they want to see the new lesabres
betty hides her reaction
del contd and i dont need sue anns fat ass around to fuck it up
just knock it off kay
anyhow theyre s theyre not even new
theyre new to us
truce for a moment
del plucks a copy of soap opera guide from bettys purse while absently taking a bite from bettys cupcake
he narrowly misses the candle
del contd jesus
you know these actors are mainly models which are mainly fags
theyve done studies
the restre assholes
but you know what bugs me most about these soaps
she silently mimics him as he says
del contd its people with no lives watching other peoples fake lives
yeah i guess theres nothing like watching those tenpins fall huh del
that is a skill
del lurches to his feet and crosses to the bird cages as the canaries chirp and sing excitedly at his approach
del contd daddys here babies
to betty be back later
she collects his dirty dishes puts them in the sink and starts to wash them
then she stops
what the hell am i doing
she drops the dishes with a clatter pours herself a glass of wine lights the candle on her deflowered cupcake and opens the one card on the table
a traditional greeting from her grandparents
red hearts and lace
a color photo of them enclosed
betty smiles at this
after moment she quietly sings a quick refrain of happy birthday to herself
standing wrapped only in a towel lonnie speaks into the phone
tell me something good sugar
the beautiful nurse chloe is curled up seductively on her sofa with her phone in one hand and a cigarette in the other
were all set
i told him my cars in the shop
he said hed be happy to give me a ride home
tell me something i dont know
betty hits fast forward
characters flit on and off the screen at top speed until david ravell appears
chloes magnificent legs are folded into the seat of davids sl
she struggles with her seatbelt so he helps her
she makes sure their hands touch
thanks for pulling over david
i cant go that fast without taking a breather
its nice to see what this little beauty can do though
i guess somehow all that speed helps me forget the past
im sure it does
touching the seats mmm leather
how far do they recline
david smiles a little uncomfortable
chloe contd listen david i know ive said it before but i want to tell you again how sorry i am about your wife
it must make you scared to get close to someone again
she puts her hand over his on the gear shift
finally he has to move her fingers to start the car
chloe contd lets not go
betty sits on an old couch in the den and watches eyes glued to the screen
suddenly she hears the sound of tires on gravel
headlights sweep across the window
she hits pause and crosses to look out
del gets out of a black lincoln town car followed by charlie and wesley the guys in the team jackets from the diner
charlie is years old
he wears a dress shirt slacks and docksiders
the suburban father look
hes in jeans t shirt and white reeboks
clean cut the kid who used to mow your parents lawn
betty quickly snaps out the light and closes the door until it is open only a crack
del swaggers into the house
the two men follow politely
you can have the best damn running backs in the world somebodys still gotta block for em
youre a hundred percent right
they rely on whats his names arm too much
del stops and looks around deflated by the mess
the den is only a short flight of steps from the living room and the kitchen
betty has a clean view of both from where she sits on the couch
she hears del come in but doesnt take her eyes off the tv screen
my apologies gentlemen
i asked my wife to straighten this shit up before she went out
del crosses to an old stereo and puts on an lp
he smiles as the music overtakes the room
charlie and wesley stand nearby appreciating the quaintness of the surroundings
now what can i get you gentlemen to drink
del crosses to the cupboard
charlie and wesley stand leisurely in the living room
bourbon little water thank you
you got it
wesley looks at a wedding portrait of del and betty
you got a fine one right here
to del your wifes a very lovely woman
have i seen her before
if you ate at the tip top you did
oh yes with the coffee
yep betty pours a pretty mean cup
del reaches into the fridge and produces a miller for wesley then mixes two drinks and walks into the dining room and charlie and wesley follow to the table and
i like this
i like doing business in the home
noticing the card and cupcake whos birthday
whatd you get her
oh umm a car
so to a successful transaction
they raise their glasses and drink
del tosses back his drink in one gulp
chloe is on top of david kissing him on the mouth as he resists
he finally has to push her away forcibly and we hear a tearing sound
chloes blouse has been ripped
im sorry chloe
she starts to cry
david reaches out to comfort her
david contd its not that i dont find you attractive
im just not ready
david looks up to find her lips on his
in spite of himself he gives in to the warmth of her kiss and responds hungrily
betty is mesmerized
the men have retired into the dining room sitting or standing around a worn wooded table
charlie and wesley are just finishing their drinks
all right gentlemen lets get down to it
i need to know if youre for real
if were for real
you dont exactly look like drug dealers
isnt that the point
yeah well i dont have time to screw around
i got buyers in dallas houston and vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up
we appreciate that
but you just poured me a drink id like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes
you got five
its a nice place you got here
sweet little town fair oaks
you like it here
laughs are you kidding me
whats to like
seems like a nice place
it is if you like idiots
what do you mean
its a small town man
i never should have left omaha
people here think
they act small
theyre a bunch of dumb fucks
you better believe it
could you give us an example
im asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck
i dont follow
youre not a dumb fuck are you del
i didnt think so
so give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing
not being stupid youre equipped to recognize it
are we gonna do business here or not
relax we brought the cash
im just curious
cant you give me an example
annoyed all right
okay new burger king opens up
these assholes get excited and start lining up
like its some five star restaurant
the place is mobbed
five stars huh
is that stupid wesley
no thats ignorant
they just dont know any better
thats what i thought
to del you better give me another example
this is bullshit can we get down to business here please
off a look from charlie wesley produces a pistol and gently nudges the barrel into dels ear
the umm injunsre stupid
you did not just say injuns del
the indians injuns whatever
theyre always drunk and doing stupid things
driving their cars into trees
puking on the sidewalk
around here that would be kiowa kickapoo or osage if im not mistaken
i dont know
well my idea of stupid is very different from yours
so heres how this is gonna work
would you take your socks off please
you heard the man
del slowly takes his shoes and socks off
hes sweating trembling
im gonna talk to you and when im finished you can answer
but i dont like being interrupted
now roll them into a ball
del does it
oh jesus please
and put them in your mouth
at a sharp look from charlie del obediently stuffs the socks into his mouth and starts to cry
wesley produces a roll of duct tape and fastens dels hands to the back of his chair
betty is glued to the tv oblivious to the men
chloe and david are still talking in his car
she continues to cry
youre wonderful chloe you are
but i just know theres something special out there for me
now im gonna tell you what stupid is
stupid is taking something that doesnt belong to you
stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are by their very nature untrustworthy
that is so right
stupid is calling people in kansas city who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole and trying to sell it to them
now thats really stupid
so you see we have totally different ideas of whats stupid and whats not
del nods crying sweating
charlie contd good
now were getting somewhere
you agree that you were stupid
del nods again
wesley collects charlies glass and mixes him another drink
he gets a beer for himself and stands behind del
charlie sips his drink slowly savoring it
charlie contd you know a hundred and fifty years ago youd have been scalped for that remark about native americans
right here where your house is youd have been scalped
hell of a way to die
it wasnt always fatal wesley
we could scalp del right now and hed be plenty alive to tell us how it feels
dels eyes get huge
its pretty simple too
first you take a knife and just draw a mark right across the hairline
wesley produces a long knife and traces a line across the very top of dels forehead
trickles of blood wind their way down his brow
del is moaning and panting through his socks
charlie contd hold still del were just talking here
pointing to a spot then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut
its amazing how easily the scalp comes off
a mark huh
wesley takes a jab at dels forehead with his knife leaving a small cut
del starts twitching rocking back and forth as wesley grabs a fistful of his hair
wesley contd shut the fuck up
i bleed more than that when i shave
del stops moving
he breathes furiously through his nostrils
i want to know the particulars of your stupid act how you got what doesnt belong to you who helped you get it and of course where it is now
charlie pulls the socks out of dels mouth
del splutters gasping for air
its in the buick
i swear to god its all there
blake nods to him grimly
you wanted to see me blake
i wish i could say i had good news
off davids look david ill get right to the point
chloe jensen has filed charges of sexual
assault against you
you can continue to practice at l
county but im afraid i have to revoke your privileges here at loma vista until this is resolved
hold on davids shocked expression
music up as bettys not sure what del said but the panic in his voice got through
she hits pause and takes a look
del is facing her tiny rivulets of blood running into his terrified eyes
wesley stands at his shoulder still holding a handful of his hair still poised with the knife
i got it from a truck driver named duane cooley out of amarillo
he brings my cars down from detroit
but i havent touched it i swear to you
annoyed charlie stuffs the socks back in dels mouth
her gaze shifts from del to wesley drawn by wesleys demonic expression
consider yourself lucky
luckier than those injuns you have such contempt for
wesley stares at the top of dels head
betty stares at wesley
charlie walks into the kitchen for another drink
charlie contd ill tell you if anyone got a raw deal its the american indian
this country has a black mark on its soul for what was done to them
wesleys nostrils flare
betty leans forward
charlie contd im all for them owning casinos getting rich off the white mans greed
its a beautiful piece of irony isnt it wesley
and with a long scream wesley rips dels scalp from his head
it makes a sickening sound like fabric tearing
for a long moment there is only silence
an eerie silence
suddenly del screams into his socks and thrashes in his seat blood pouring down his head on all sides
somehow he manages to get to his feet the chair still taped to him and begins smashing into whatever is near
blood flies and curios shatter as del thunders through the room
a dying bull only messier
its quite a show
wesley steps back staring at the dripping scalp in his hand as if wondering how it got there
betty is transfixed horrified
charlie re enters
the two men look at each other over dels muffled screams as he plows headlong into wooden paneling a china cabinet and finally back toward them near the breakfast counter
del bashes blindly into it
charlie contd to wesley what the fuck is the matter with you
wesley is practically foaming at the mouth still rushing on what he did
charlie draws a silenced pistol and mercifully shoots del through the head
the big man stops suddenly blinks once or twice topples over
betty points her remote at the dining room and clicks it as if trying to make the image disappear
finally she gives up slowly turning away from the carnage and aims at the tv
a reason to love pauses on the face of david ravell and betty sits in absolute silence
charlie quickly begins to hide their tracks producing a plastic baggie and collecting the beer cans and his own glass
he also wipes down the fridge as wesley watches
are you out of your mind
you scalped him
you told me how to do it
that was to get him to talk
get rid of that thing will you
wesley crosses to the garbage can steps on the lever
he looks at the scalp one more time before dropping it in
this is great just great
now we dont know where the goddamn stuff is
he told us its in the buick
we dont know which buick do we
well whyd you shoot him
i had to shoot him
it was the only decent thing to do
they exit the house
contd this is very unprofessional wesley
betty is still in the family room staring at the tv
she pushes play again and david ravell begins to speak
sue ann comes out of her house balancing a homemade cake in front of her
the candles give off an unearthly glow as she picks her way up the sizemores gravel drive
betty is catatonic staring at the frozen image of david ravell on her tv
downstairs sue ann comes in
happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
happy birthday dear a terrified scream as the cake lands unceremoniously on the entryway
as she hits play youre wonderful chloe you are
but i just know theres something special out there for me
roy enters the foyer and looks around carrying a pad and pen in hand
he hears voices from the kitchen sees flashbulbs going off
he sneaks down the hall when a voice stops him
hang on there roy
nobody comes in
elden called me
he wants to ahh make a statement for the paper
the deputy nods him through and roy moves off toward the sewing room where he has spotted betty
betty is packing an overnight bag on her bed when roy enters and quietly closes the door behind him
she is working with a purpose almost like a different person from the woman we first met
still bright and cheerful but with a willful glint in her eye
are you okay
im great good content
stopping what happened to your arm roy
oh nothing its fine
i just need to keep it wrapped for a few
make sure its elevated
you want me to make you a sling
its no problem
betty starts whipping a t shirt into place but stops abruptly
she turns curiously to roy
betty contd whatre you doing here roy
well i was worried about you and i wanted to make sure you were alright
and i guess i was sort of hoping i could ask you about what happened
sure i saw the whole thing
it was disgusting
did you get a look at who did it
was it anyone that you
it was chloe
sheriff ballard enters the house surveys the scene of the crime where one deputy wipes blood off his boot with a paper towel and erupts when he sees roy
hey you guys wanna try not stepping directly in the evidence please
to roy ostrey you and your goddamn police scanner
i leave for ten minutes and
betty im sorry about this
he motions to a female officer
ballard contd why dont you take her down to the station
well be along in a bit
she leads betty out the kitchen door
as ballard leads roy into the next room
okay lets go
i got nothing for the record yet
my arm careful
ahh whatd you do now
fall off your bike again
no its nothing i
my piranha just mauled me a little when i layed their food out
theyre meat eaters roy just drop the shit in there
they prefer a more formal presentation
i dont usually go so close to the surface but i was
you are so goddamn weird
oh and by the way get the hell outta here
no elden i need to
you need to get yourself gone from my crime scene
and leave betty alone shes
she knows who killed del
elden she said it was a woman
it wasnt a woman
yes it was
betty saw the whole thing
your killers name is chloe
im tellin you it wasnt no woman roy
ballard drags roy into the living room where he sees del
he has been turned upright and is being carefully examined
you think a woman did that
roy runs into the kitchen covering his mouth
ballard and his cronies delight in watching roy struggle with the dry heaves
roy runs to the kitchen sink almost loses it then wipes his mouth with a paper towel
kinda looks like a burnt out roman candle dont he
del mustve sold a lemon to the wrong indian and got paid back the old fashioned way
them kickapoos get pretty mean when they drink
roy sees dels scalp in the garbage can as he goes to drop his crumpled towel inside
so you think youre gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee
they no longer live in tepees mr
did you send anyone out there
you bet i did
i got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now
you just go write your little story roy
ill handle the police work
you better handle whats in this garbage can first
every car on the lot has its trunk open and spare tire on the ground behind it
charlie and wesley are at the last car
i still dont understand how you knew del was telling the truth
i saw his soul wesley
he was face to face with his god and no one lies in that situation
but your geronimo act rattled me and i abandoned my instincts
never abandon you instincts
you gave me a look
that one look you got
i thought you were done so i took him out
i wasnt done i was just sick of hearing him whine
and you didnt take him out you scalped him
christ i almost puked did i tell you that
well whyd you have to tell that indian story
what the hell does that mean
if id told a ty cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat
wesley is stung
charlie slams the last trunk in disgust
the rest remain where they are open
charlie contd its not here
you just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this
why not itll confuse em
gotta do something now that you fucked it up
i wanted to make a statement
let me tell you something
in our business you cant put food on the table if your phone doesnt ring
the guys who get the calls are good not flashy just good
they get in they get out
nobody knows a goddamn thing
boom boom boom
three in the head and you know theyre dead
thats a good motto
fine ill get you a bumpersticker but you better start believing it
its the only statement you need to make
betty is questioned in a holding room by a police officer and a doctor
ballard and roy watch through a window
and did your husband know these people
but he ignored them
and how did that make you feel betty
i felt all cold inside
ballard looks both ways to make sure he wont be overheard
i questioned joyce about all this
seems she was pretty familiar with ol del
on a regular basis if you get my drift
and half the other guys in this town
including you i believe
anyway so what
suppose betty found out about them
you said a woman couldnt have done it
a woman can write a check
so youre saying betty sizemore our betty sizemore who you were in swing choir with has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched
s just a theory
just cause im thinking it dont mean i like it
the doctor comes out of the holding room
ballard contd how is she
shes in a kind of shock
i see all the signs of a post traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms
could i have that in american
its a type of altered state
it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning
so she did witness it
oh youre sharp as a tack elden
he spins roy around and marches him toward the door one arm bent behind his back
oww the arm the arm
you just dont know when to quit roy
you were jealous of me when i got hall monitor in seventh grade and youre still jealous now
one question doctor please
outside the door you cant do this
im the press i have rights
thats right you have the right to remain silent
ballard pushes roy out the door
as he returns roy reappears behind him leaning in to listen
ballard doesnt see him
ballard contd sorry you had to see that
you were saying
i was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder but her memory of it is gone at least for the time being
i also think you ought to have her
stay with someone tonight
any idea who chloe or lonnie are
friends from the diner maybe
well you should find out
she keeps talking about them
ballard nods sure hes got a clue here
he looks in at betty again just as she begins repacking her travel bag
he frowns at this his suspicions fueled all the more
a police car pulls up to sue anns house
betty gets out carrying her overnight bag
sue ann appears embraces her and leads her inside
betty lies down in a bright red race car bed
sue ann tucks her in and turns out the light
let me know if you need anything okay
are you and larry happy
oh i dunno
enough i spose
then you should treasure that
you gotta hold on to whatever you got thats any good even if its only a little bit
all you been through
i ever tell you what a good friend you are
all the time
well you are
after a beat
something bad happened to del and me didnt it
you just get some sleep everythings gonna be fine
sue ann im sorry about all this but i just know theres something special out there for me
sue ann looks down at her friend troubled
she strokes bettys hair gently and kisses her
after she leaves betty lies awake staring at the ceiling
a mobile dangles overhead
the mickey mouse clock on the wall reads
beneath it betty is sitting up in bed wide awake
betty comes down the stairs without a sound
she finds a pen and paper near the phone and writes a note
insert dear del this is the hardest thing ive ever done and i cant even face you
but i need to be honest
we havent been happy for a long time
you always say people need their space and now youll have some
betty she takes off her wedding band and puts it on the table
betty raises the garage door tosses her overnight bag and birthday money envelope into the lesabre and gets in
she drives through fair oaks past the town limits
she keeps on driving until her car recedes into the moonlit prairie horizon
she comes to a sudden halt in front of the you are leaving kansas billboard
she stares hard at it through the windshield
suddenly she hits the gas and bolts off along the oklahoma blacktop
she never looks back
betty yawns looks at her watch and increases her speed
when she sees a sign for a motel ahead she pulls off the highway
she parks at a truck stop restaurant motel complex hops out and runs to the motel office window
betty enters her room immediately turns on the tv and plops down on the bed
and now we return to a reason to love
a crowded truck stop in the texas flatlands
three truck drivers in jeans flannel shirts and denim jackets walk across the parking lot
one is an old grizzled veteran with a salt and pepper stubble and a greasy cat cap on his head
next to him is duane a burly young driver in fancy cowboy boots
flanking duane is wesley
so you got asian women
southern accent sure i got asian
got black white any color you like video and magazine
got fat chicks and animals too if you want em
well it was a piece of luck running into you duane
i thought i was
gonna have to take wesley out and hose him down
all he talks about is those japanese gals
i like em small
when youre inside a little asian chick its like your dick is the axle that holds her body together
thats nicely put
you outta get yourself to thailand
they reach duanes truck an empty car carrier with michigan plates and climb up into the cab
two confederate flags criss cross over duanes cb unit
on the dashboard is a rebel flag pin a bumper sticker that says the south will rise again and a dozen country music tapes
duane gets in the sleeper cab where stacks of porno tapes and magazines reach the ceiling
wesley takes the drivers seat charlie the passenger seat
what part of dixie are you from duane
in case i didnt tell you its cash only gentlemen
we can live with that
im a yankee myself
duane passes two videos to wesley
heres ghengis kunt and the demilitarized zone
laughs theyre korean so theyre pretty hot
you know its interesting
the south lost the civil war but they still seem to get all the glory
jeb stuart stonewall jackson jefferson davis theyre all losers in my book
duane stops digging through the videotapes
the fuck you talking about
even robert e
lee was a loser
to wesley he goin crazy on us or what
did you know the most brutal inhumane prison of the entire war was in georgia
and where was that old man
they did horrible things to men there
chloe is curled up on her white leather sofa cowering as lonnie hovers over her accusingly
i think you better tell me whats going on here chloe
i just feel
funny about what we did
laughs you feel guilty
let me remind you of something sweetheart
youre in this up to those fabulous eyes of yours
the camera holds on her face for a melodramatic beat
chloes trapped and she knows it
pull back to reveal betty lying on the bed in her motel room out cold
the flag poles over the cb unit are bare
duane is in the sleeper cab his forearms bound to his thighs with duct tape
a telltale piece of confederate red fabric hangs out of his mouth
there is a purplish bruise on his forehead
hes quiet but glowering at his captors
so at a rest stop outside logansport you noticed that two guys were slipping something extra in one of your cars and you decided to see what it was
then you figured youd take this valuable commodity and go into business yourself even though it didnt belong to you
but you needed a crackerjack salesman to move it so you made the biggest mistake of your short life and chose del
sound right so far
charlie contd dels dead by the way
i sent him to the great beyond
actually i scalped him and then you killed him
duane narrows his eyes in disbelief
now the one thing i dont get is that we checked all the buicks on that lot
four lesabres and nothing in em
duane smiles mockingly
there werent four were there
charlie reaches up above the visor and pulls down a rumpled manifest
he leafs through it
charlie contd there were five damn it
i should have known
so what happened to the fifth car
duane shrugs his shoulders
you know youre going to die dont you duane
duane nods and you really dont know where that other lesabre is do you
duane shakes his head
charlie sighs resigned
charlie contd hes telling the truth
he doesnt know
should i kill him now
any last words general lee
duane nods emphatically
wesley pulls the confederate flags out of his mouth
suck my dick you yankee piece of shit
he spits in wesleys face
charlie has to restrain wesley
god i admire that
ya see that wesley
thats why they get all the glory
charlie climbs down from the big rig and heads across the parking lot
the town car is parked near the adjacent motel just a few spaces away from bettys lesabre
with a furious calm wesley wipes his face then takes out a can of lighter fluid sets it on the dash and looks at duane
whyd you spit on me
charlie pulls the town car alongside duanes rig and drums the steering wheel impatiently
it begins to rain
there are flashes of lightning in the distance
come on wesley three shots
a flash of orange flame ignites inside duanes cab
finally three dull thuds reverberate from inside
wesley climbs down clutching a videotape and gets in the car
charlie contd what the hell was that another statement
well no one ever spit in my face before
especially some cracker fuck
you have to rise above it
the professionals rise above that kind of thing
as they drive away flames are beginning to dance inside the cab
the flickering light of the tv screen is the only light
betty lies asleep on the bed
the news comes on and she starts to stir as
small town of fair oaks
has left people shaken
owner manager of sizemore motors
betty sits up
on the tv screen is a shot of del as julius caesar from one of his commercials
contd police are still investigating
she blinks at the screen confused as the next story comes on
betty reaches for the phone
ballard is doing paperwork
roy is asleep on a nearby bench
a deputy picks up a ringing phone and hands it to ballard
sheriff its betty sizemore on two
im in a motel
has something happened to del
did he do something stupid
she hangs up
headlights sweep across the curtains startling her
betty crosses the border from texas into new mexico
she grips the wheel intently driving for all shes worth
bettys blue corsica sits surrounded by yellow police tape
half a dozen cops mill around
to one side are several reporters and photographers roy included
a few residents mill around in the background
a stack of pictures of betty sit on a makeshift table
who witnessed ms
sizemore driving here
the assistant manager mr
but he couldnt identify the male passenger
only to say he was wearing green
what if the killers didnt see her
you published her picture youre gonna get her killed
no were bringing the community into the effort to find her
i spoke to betty sizemore yesterday
the reporters hush thats right
theres no doubt in my mind folks
shes on the run
whether or not shes mixed up in all this remains to be seen
thats bullshit sheriff
you think shes a suspect
id like to apologize for our local boy
hes been in love with betty since the fifth grade ysee
he means well but hes in over his head on this
close shot of a headline in the wichita eagle eye witness to brutal murder missing over a picture of betty
charlie is one of many customers reading a copy
wesley is plowing through a stack of pancakes
so how do we know that cars still in fair oaks
but a le sabrell be easy to find if its here town this size
he said he gave his wife some car as a gift remember
charlie turns the page for emphasis and studies bettys features
charlie contd this is bad wesley
very very bad
wesley happily adds three strips of bacon brought by a waitress who wears a button with the word missing over bettys face
charlie contd extremely bad
wesley finally looks up directly at the picture of betty
charlie contd did you hear what i said
wesley nods his mouth stuffed with food
charlie contd maybe you dont appreciate the gravity of this situation
its bad enough that we dont have what we came here for
its worse that we dont know where it is
and now this
points at the headline this was supposed to be my last job
i already put the deposit down on my boat
how can you eat at a time like this
i get nauseous just watching you
i can eat because i know we didnt kidnap that woman
i can eat because they arent looking for us
and i can eat cause im fucking hungry
off charlies look relax
shes gonna end up on a milk carton and thats about it
i hope youre right
i know i am
lets just do what we gotta do here and get the fuck gone
they sit for a moment in silence
wesley swallowing without chewing and charlie studying bettys photo
she got out of town awfully fast
and wasnt she quiet in that house
i think most women would have screamed dont you
i know they wouldve
we could be dealing with a cunning ruthless woman
sue ann opens her front door to find wesley standing before her
its a new wesley glasses conservative suit and a convincingly humble manner
im dwight campbell with neighborly life insurance
im looking for betty sizemore
i wish i could help you but i cant
wesley is hit by a flying action figure
he doesnt flinch
kids run by
arent they precious
maam she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband
does she have any relatives in the area
well her grandparents are down in oklahoma but thats it
and are you in touch with mrs
but im taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back
a reason to love
wesleys eyes light up
he cant help himself
did chloe testify
reassuring i dont think she will
shes a slut but i just dont think shes that mean
jasminell bring her around
do you have yesterdays show on tape by any chance
sue ann holds the door open smiling and wesley enters
charlie nurses a cup of coffee at the counter while talking to darlene
his federal marshalls badge rests on the counter
shehands him two photos of betty taken at her birthday celebration
in one shes holding the cardboard david ravell
the other a closeup shot
and how long did she work here
oh five years give or take
you two in high school together
arent you a sweetheart
no not quite
anyway shes been with us awhile
but she wanted more out of life right
she just wanted something outta life
and with del she wasnt getting nothing
thats her husband del
im sorry about what happened and all but thats the way i feel about all of this
holding up photos may i
if it helps bring her back be my guest
thank you for your cooperation
just one more thing
did she ever talk about getting rich
darlene tries to smile and returns to the kitchen
charlie studies the snapshots comparing them
wesley is in bed on top of joyce humping her slowly
and what kind of car does she drive
well she wanted a lesabre but del made her use that blue corsica
so is this what you boysd call pumping me for information
joyce giggles as wesley stops moving
did you say lesabre
look she didnt kill del over no car if thats what youre thinking
but she could have taken one right
with her knees joyce prods him into humping her again
maybe but i dont think she had the nerve
i know her
and im a pretty good judge of character
joyce reaches for a cigarette on the nightstand and takes a deep drag
wesley closes his eyes and turns away offended
yeah i can see that
betty drives along a lonely stretch of highway that slowly reveals a desert town in the distance
big ol place
lots of wood and red leather
betty rushes in as the clock on the wall reads
the town drunk merle is alone at the bar watching bass masters on a huge tv screen
in front of him is a remote control
a few others at tables
betty sidles up to the bar and sits down
she looks at merle at the clock at the remote
would you mind very much if i changed the channel at three oclock
he burps then finally looks at her with bleary eyes
its very important to me
a reason to love comes on at three around here
he ignores her
betty puts her wallet on the bar
betty contd ill give you money
merle slams his hand down on the bar scaring her
ellen draber s appears behind the bar looks at the clock and takes the remote from merle
she changes the channel to a reason to love as the opening titles end
betty cant believe it
merle smiles at her wickedly
merle contd please keep it down its time for a reason to love
thats real funny
why dont you have another drink
whats the matter here
i begged him to let me put that on
hes a prick
youre a prick
merle grunts in reply
ellen turns back to betty
so youre into reason too
finally someone civilized
im ellen what can i get you
hi im betty
ill take a miller if you got it
chloe paces in front of her white sofa a matching white telephone in her hand
she looks worried
whats that bitch up to now
we hear the beep tone of an answering machine
we need to talk
i dont think i can go through with this
she hangs up
the camera stays on her for a melodramatic beat of introspection as we go to commercial
do you have a phone
ellen swings a phone up onto the bar
if its long distance you can leave me a buck when youre done
i just wanted to let you know im okay
im at the canyon ranch bar in
looks at ellen phoenix
shut up merle
about halfway there i guess
sue ann is in her kitchen ignoring the pleas of all three children
youve gotta come home
weve been worried sick about you
are you alright
sue ann i thought you of all people would back me up on this you know what dels like
how did he take my note
betty honey listen to me
a man came by from mutual life insurance
he says youve got money comin to you from dels policy
dels life insurance policy are you with me
what are you talking about
a reason to love comes back on the tv
tell del im sorry
i left so quick but i need to do this
i gotta go
listen to me
betty hangs up
david is at a bar staring into his drink
lonnie is with him
how you holding up amigo
i just wish i knew why shes doing it
women are an unsolved mystery
if that little weasel ever walked in here i wouldnt serve him
id slap his face
id kick him in the nuts if i thought he had any
there are two empty beer bottles in front of betty
the theme music and closing credits of a reason to love are playing
betty pushes the phone back across the bar
where you headed betty
los angeles california
and you called your friend and shes telling you not to go
betty nods when i went to europe my friends told me i was crazy
laughs this is my first time out of kansas
i should call you dorothy
when i left here i went straight to italy
everybody told me not to go
but i wanted to go to rome ever since i saw audrey hepburn in roman holiday and goddamnit i went
did you love it
sure i loved it
it was great
ellen rinses a few glasses as she talks to betty
let me tell you something
i got groped by these tunisian guys who thought i was a slut for wearing shorts it was hotter than stink the whole time and i got some kind of
weird gum disease from the water
plus it ended my marriage thats horrible
no he was a toad
even more of a toad than merle
i just wear the ring to keep the flies away
rome was the best thing i ever did because i did it
and i swear to you it changed me
ive been to rome italy
i sat every morning at the cafe sistina and had my cappuccino and watched the pilgrims walk to mass and no one can ever take that away from me
betty leans across the bar conspiratorially
she looks at merle to make sure he wont hear her
i left my husband two days ago
im getting back with my ex fianc
he proposed to me right around here so i guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop
wait i thought you said youd never been outta kansas
i mean except for that
im trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist so thats pretty good
laughs i spose his names david ravell
truly shocked how did you know
whats his real name
george mccord the actor
no i mean david ravell
hes a surgeon
ellen looks at betty
yeah i know we just watched him together remember
up there on the tv
off bettys earnest look good god almighty
ive heard about people like you
ellen whistles wipes the bar down to buy a few seconds
merle looks over at betty then catches ellens eye
piss off merle
to betty so how you gonna find him betty
ill go to the hospital
what if you cant find him
what if you get out there and nothings the way you thought it was gonna be
you made out alright
yeah but at least i knew rome was gonna be there when i arrived
ellen walks to the end of the bar and starts rinsing glasses
after a beat betty gets up and moves down close to her
ellen this is the biggest thing ive ever done but ive gotta do it
you take care of yourself then betty and dont let anybody stop you
to tell you the truth i cant believe ive made it this far
it may not be europe but i just know theres something special out there for me
ellen looks into bettys eyes sees the innocence the hope and enthusiasm and has to look away
betty takes it as her cue to leave
she smiles puts two dollars on the bar near the phone and leaves
ellen stands perfectly still watching the door
what planet is she from
betty approaches the grand canyon driving slowly along the south rim searching for a specific spot
finally she pulls over abruptly
this is it
we can tell by the joy in her expression
betty walks to the rail and gazes out at the canyon
turning her head slowly as if expecting it she sees david ravell leaning on the rail about twenty feet away clutching a bouquet of roses
betty starts toward him
he starts toward her
a magic moment
shattered when a black sedan appears inching its way along
david vanishes and
an elderly man helps his wife out of the car and snaps her picture in front of the canyon
betty moves away
charlie and wesley drive across kansas farm country
so she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day
you think so
joyce says shes timid
joyce was screwing del
id say that about torches her credibility wouldnt you
yeah well if the wifes trying to sell it shell fuck up
shes an amateur just like del was
the car phone rings
into phone yes
is this neighborly life insurance
sorry youve got the wrong number
he hangs up
no i see betty as a midwestern stoic type
ice water in her veins
a clear thinker
probably a swede or a finn
what is a finn
you should read more
listen to me
i think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this and we gave it to her
she kept to herself for years living with a pompous asshole
then she sees her opportunity and boom
she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust
these heartlanders cant figure it out cause thats not their sweet little betty
weve been tracking her for what three days and i already understand her bettern most the people in that shitty little burg
charlie pulls out the close up photo and studies it
charlie contd betty betty betty
so what the fucks a finn
oh for chrissakes
it just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining then cut their mommas throat and go dancing the same night
like a worthy adversary wesley
like a very worthy adversary
roy approaches his fish tank cautiously
he leans down and looks at the piranha as a tv commercial ends and a reason to love comes on
he then returns to his computer struggling to find the right words and to type them with only one hand
he types a little stares at the screen then deletes an entire sentence one character at a time hammering on the delete key
he glances up at the television as the words chloe and lonnie are repeated
roy and sue ann go straight to ballards office where they find him at his desk eating lunch out of tupperware containers
he wears a napkin tucked into his shirt top
what the hell do you want
hey sue ann whats up
we think we know where betty is
do i have to hear this now
whats with the tupperware elden did meredith run outta baggies
no reason to get a plate dirty
i see youre sticking to the diet betty put you on
worry about your own goddamn lunch
excited to sue ann tell him what you told me
betty is a big big fan of the soap opera a reason to love
she tosses a copy of soap opera digest on the desk
ballard ignores it and keeps eating
why do i need to see this
did he ask you to
i saw chloe and lonnie on t
theyre television characters
bettys in love with dr
david ravell from the show
what if shes out in los angeles looking for him
the actor i mean
thats the dumbest thing ive ever heard
well she called sue ann yesterday from arizona
she said she was in arizona did she
you people are even more stupid than i thought
the womans on the run and shes gonna just phone in her location
come on elden shes not on the run
couldnt you at least call the los angeles police department
you gotta do that much
hey im the law
i dont gotta do nothing
the lincoln pulls into the dusty overgrown driveway and front yard of a derelict farm
the remains of pie and coffee on the table charlie and wesley kick back with jerrold blaine and his wife elizabeth both in their s
photos of betty at various ages lie scattered in front of them
charlie holds up a picture of a young betty in ballerina costume posing at the barre
he studies it intently
this is betty at twelve
betty was a lovely child
and she always had such spirit
but after her mother died
would you say she was ambitious
oh theres no tellin what that girl couldve accomplished and she never had it easy
never really had a childhood
caring for her father going to school
charlie admires a photo of betty around years old
he continues to rummage through a box of collectibles pocketing a small childs diary when it is convenient
wise beyond her years im sure and such poise too
quietly very very impressive
well then did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband
i dont like talking bad about the dead but now that hes gone i can tell you she put up with things in that marriage i wouldnt have
and yes she of all people was the one who defended him
and thats why what that sheriff said makes me so angry
what do you mean
if anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed it would have been me
taking her hand mrs
i can tell you right now without a doubt that your granddaughter is alive and did not kill del sizemore
youve got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone
thats not our betty
defensive why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody
because it aint natural young man
what are you talking about
killings totally natural
its dying that isnt natural
covering my partners still young mr
blaine and he loves his job
laughs hed like to kill all the criminals himself
now if betty was running from someone where do you think shed go
betty drives through boyle heights east l
holding a map and checking street signs
she is wearing a brand new nurses uniform
up ahead she sees the hillside complex of l
county usc hospital
hurriedly she pulls over and checks herself in the visor mirror
she is underwhelmed
i still look like a waitress
the chief nurse a large dynamic woman in her s faces betty across her desk
of course i dont know every doctor who works here
ravells the finest surgeon on the staff
you must know him
hes incredibly handsome gentle considerate
hes being sued for sexual assault right now but off chief nurses look its not true
he was set up
well i certainly would have heard about that
of course hes only here two days a week
hes also on staff over at loma vista
i dont think i know that hospital
its in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun has palm trees out front mountains in the background
youve just described all of southern california
the chief nurse looks at betty for a moment then stands abruptly signaling the end of the interview
contd well im sorry but i cant even consider you without references or a resume
and frankly i dont know how you could have forgotten them
on her way down the hall betty passes a patients room when the sound of a person moaning stops her
she cant help but go inside
a tv plays commercials
an older woman lies in bed alone and staring at the ceiling
betty looks around and notices several arrangements of flowers on a deserted nightstand
she brings them over to the older womans bedside positions them then gently strokes her head
you rest now
the womans eyes flutter
she is disoriented at first then calms as she adjusts to the comforting sight of betty
betty takes her hand
im nurse betty
the woman smiles serenely at this and begins to drift off
betty checks her monitors as the opening credits of a reason to love begin to play
she glances up at the doorway at the same moment and sees dr
david ravell standing at the entrance
he checks the chart on the door smiles warmly at betty and then moves off
in a flash betty is up and after him
the theme music is her private soundtrack as she checks out every man in surgical scrubs looking for david ravell
she sees him
in all his glory at the end of a corridor walking away from her
betty gives chase
she gains steadily on him her heart racing
as they near emergency the noise level picks up
he stops at the nurses station
betty closes the gap
she starts to run
he turns to face her
its not david ravell
betty contd sorry i thought you were someone else
do you know dr
the man shakes his head
betty keeps going looking around its incredible the size the activity the intensity
dozens of patients lie on gurneys awaiting treatment in a holding area
its still more intense at the entrance voices talking back and forth urgently police officers civilians doctors and nurses converging
five ambulances unload patients at the same time
at that moment a group of twenty japanese hospital administrators reaches the e
portion of their tour
a white mercedes tears up the ramp and screeches to a stop
a young man in gang colors is pushed out bleeding heavily
a doctor runs at the mercedes to head it off yelling indignantly
the car plows right into him and takes off
another ambulance crests the ramp lights flashing
the mercedes slams into it head on
nurses and doctors run into the parking lot
a gangbanger gets out of the mercedes dazed and wobbly
he pulls a pistol
everyone dives for cover
the mercedes driver is unconscious
the driver of the smashed up ambulance is slumped over the wheel
the rear doors fly open and a young hispanic woman rosa herrera leaps out
doctors and nurses work on patients and try to get to the injured doctor but the kid with the gun keeps them away
security guards draw their guns and scream at him to drop it
rosa contd to gunman in spanish hey you little shit
if i had a gun id shoot you right now
the loading area is jammed with panicked people
doctors and nurses creep out of the hospital on all fours trying to stay
no one is getting to rosa whose frantic eyes find betty
they look right at each other
rosa contd what are you standing there for
betty walks toward her calmly indifferent to the danger as rosa pulls the gurney out of the ambulance herself
a paramedic lies unconscious inside
rosa contd you gotta help him hes hurt bad
on the gurney is a young man with a chest wound nearly dead from blood loss
a doctor appears and quickly examines him while keeping one eye on the gunman
he looks up at betty
he doesnt have a chance
help us over here
the doctor takes off
rosa looks at betty crying
betty hesitates then checks his pulse he has none
she peels back the bandages over a huge chest wound
danny its gonna be all right
betty looks at rosa again looks around for help theres no one
she plunges her fingers into the wound
rosa contd panic what are you doing
he has no heartbeat
youre hurting him
im massaging his heart
i saw it done once
she keeps working on him
we hear a gunshot and the kid with the pistol falls to the pavement
the loading area immediately fills with doctors nurses and cops
all right were moving him inside
give me a hand
rosa is shocked into motion
together they wheel danny toward the entrance
a doctor and two nurses come out to take over
betty her white uniform now covered in blood steps aside
the doctor tries to calm rosa and keep her from entering the treatment area
is he gonna live
hes got a chance
thanks to what that nurse did
they exit together as an administrator and several japanese officials approach
the chief nurse hovers nearby
to chief nurse harriet
who is that remarkable nurse
thats betty sagamore
i hired her today
several low lifes are hanging out in the lobby
when betty comes in with a bag of groceries they look up ready to hassle her as she approaches the desk clerk
may i have my key please
she puts the bag on the counter revealing that the front of her white uniform is covered with blood
she smiles at the low lifes stopping them in their tracks
the town cars looking a little muddy around the rims
charlie and wesley look tired as they wait in a seedy motel
charlie sits near a window reading diary entries aloud
wesley kicks back on the bed fast forwarding through genghis kunt and talking back to the screen
thas it thas it
conquer that bitch
what timere they coming
its not an exact science wesley
he said theyll be here
my houston contact has always been very reliable
and then were gonna do her right here
youre always so coarse
do her right here
lets just see what happens okay
reading i wish that i could find a way to speak my thoughts on mothers day
there are no words that quite express my gratitude or happiness
a pleasant smile perhaps a kiss i would not fail to give her this
id make her glad the whole day through by sayin mother i love you
i wish i could say this to my mothers face but i cant anymore
wesley rolls his eyes and turns up the volume
finally a car pulls up outside and charlie snaps the book closed
he makes a quick attempt to arrange himself and motions to wesley who turns off the tape
a woman with greasy blonde hair and skinny legs shown off by a short skirt comes in with another man
charlie looks her over disgustedly as his face falls
charlie contd who are you
to the man what the
who the hell is this
shes exactly who you said you were looking for
wait wait a minute
we have a major miscommunication here
this not betty
this is not even close to betty
what the fuckre you talking about
my names betty
then im sorry
lets get out of here
we got another long drive ahead of us
the fuck where i do not know but i know its gonna be long
gathering his things betty would never dress like that
shes not some trailer park slut
and she doesnt have a sewer for a mouth
okay thank you goodbye
keep in touch
shes got class and poise
lots of poise
the man looks at charlie then at wesley who shrugs in reply as he steers them out the door
will you ease off on the poise shit youre spooking me here
the chief nurse sits behind her desk
betty faces her like a student in the principals office now dressed in her white waitress uniform
she hopes no one notices
what you did yesterday was reckless at best
you are not an employee of this hospital
if that boy dies i dont even want to think of the lawsuit thatll follow
are we communicating here
im prepared to offer you a job
you can help out in the pharmacy until your california certification and references arrive but you are not to touch anyone
is that totally clear
betty nods fine
the chief nurse gets up and betty follows suit
contd you can start tomorrow
and dont say a word about this to anyone
studying bettys uniform is that issue
oh and one more thing about what you did yesterday
danny herrera is in bed unconscious
rosa and her mother are keeping vigil when betty enters
rosa jumps to her feet
hey its supernurse
rosa hugs her and tells her mother in spanish who betty is
rosa contd my mother doesnt speak english
herrera smiles at betty and starts to cry
as she steps forward rosa stands aside
the short stocky woman envelops betty in a bearhug
no podremos olvidar lo que hizo ayer
translating we cant forget what you did yesterday how can my family ever repay you
tell her i was just yo s que es su empleo pero
she doesnt care if it was just your job
danny would be dead now but for you
herrera kisses bettys hands and smiles through her tears
then she motions to rosa to take her place as she goes to dannys bedside
betty picks up dannys chart and reads it
rosa contd you dont sound like youre from here
i just drove in from kansas
so whyd you come to l
i came for love
my fianc is here
mi hija no hace nada para amor
youre making me look bad
my mother says i wouldnt move across the street for love
its something i had to do
thats your guy
so you staying with him
the icu nurse enters and adjusts the bank of machines feeding medicating and monitoring danny
betty watches with interest
i dont really know where he is yet
im at a hotel around the corner
man that is love
ella debe quedar contigo
ahh mom says you should stay with me
okay yeah why not
betty looks at sra
you can go get your stuff right now
ill walk you down
no thats not i couldnt
listen when someone does the kind of thing you did you gotta do something in return
so you stay with me until you find your david and live happily ever after
rosa follows betty out the door
betty and rosa make their way up the stairs of a silverlake apartment house
at the sound of screeching tires they both look down as a black lincoln town car drives by
this neighborhood you get used to it
rosa continues to talk as they climb the many stairs that lead to her door
rosa contd i got this apartment with a guy
the one you were telling me about
no this one was worse
i had to have the place sprayed when he left
he was two guys before the last one not counting a little office thing in there which im trusting you with cause if it gets out im on the street
the place is neat
as well furnished as a legal assistants salary will allow
the living room is dominated by a large glass tank filled with tropical fish
betty checks out the space
i really like your aquarium
yeah well at least fish dont use your razor or pee on the seat
sounds like youve had a pretty tough go of it with men
oh i dunno
but just once i wish id run into a guy who noticed the koi before my tits
betty smiles a little embarrassed
rosa contd come on ill show you your room
the black lincoln town car is parked on a lonely stretch of prairie highway
wesley sits in the passenger seat with the door open
the radio is on
charlie is on his cell phone nearby
into phone no we dont know where she is
no well find her
he hangs up and looks out at the horizon where huge black storm clouds are gathering
then he walks slowly to the hood of the car staring at the ground in front of his feet
whatd they say
can we go back to detroit
charlie rests his hands gently on the hood as if considering buying the car
wesleys music bangs from the radio
they said find it
find her find it
finish the job you were paid to do
they paid us half
they still owe us half
disappointed there it is again
that lousy attitude that got us here in the first place
that make a statement do an end zone dance shake your ass and sue everybody in sight attitude thats dragging this whole country down the drain
they dont owe us shit wesley
when you charlie pounds on the hood of the car scaring wesley
charlie contd that woman could be in any one of four states
four big states where the deer and the antelope play wesley
were not in rhode island
i know that
wesley switches it off
charlie turns his back to the car and addresses the angry clouds on the horizon
charlie contd do i deserve this
in the twilight of my career do i deserve this
i dont think so
ive always tried to do whats right
i never took out anybody who didnt have it coming
im a professional
youre in texas
well i should be in florida now
if carl hadnt gone in to get those stones removed you wouldnt be here and id be on my way to the keys
on my boat relaxing with a glass of port
re ti red
the first raindrops begin to fall
charlie contd im very tired wesley
ive worked hard and the work should be over but its not
this job is just beginning
he turns around wesley is in the car but hes too scared to tell charlie whose eyes are blazing
charlie silently walks around to the drivers side and gets in
he and wesley stare at each other over a photo of betty which is between them on the dash
charlie starts the engine and snatches up the picture
charlie contd whatre you thinking girl
whats going on in that pretty little mind of yours
you can tell me
he paws at the picture imploringly
he mutters to himself
wesley shakes his head and stares out
betty sits in an office along with a clerk who taps away at a computer keyboard while she studies a printed list of names
i cant find loma vista hospital
i never heard of loma vista hospital
i dont believe this
youre the second person here whos told me that
thats like ford saying they never heard of gm
try another county
rosa is on the phone at her desk in a law office
how do you get to this town called tustin
its in orange county
take the hollywood freeway to the five
just look for the really crowded road and follow that
oh umm would you mind if i borrowed some clothes
sure look in my closet take any dress you want
were still on for tonight right
betty stands in a sexy pink dress trying to decide if she should put on a hospital gown and waits tensing each time she hears a voice from the hallway
finally the doorknob a mans hand and the bottom of a white sleeve appear
the door swings open and a silver haired bespectacled doctor in his mid s enters
the nametag on his white coat reads tasteful jazz plenty of red leather booths
betty winds her way through a packed crowd passing out small white cards
rosa spots her and goes over to meet her
you made it
hey that looks great on you
beat so howd it go today
you find him
rosa starts to lead her to the bar
betty contd you know the more i think about it this really isnt davids kind of place
what are you talking about
this bar is packed with professional people
everybody says if youre going to get married this is the spot to meet someone
luckily im currently off men so ive got the luxury of not giving a shit
i know what you mean i recently had some trouble with a man a different man
and davids still getting over leslie
off rosas look his wife
he has a wife
she died in a car accident last year
she was decapitated
god thats awful
it may not have been an accident
they never did find her head
youre making this up
well see she was having an affair with a russian diplomat who i believe was mixed up with the mafia
jesus i thought my love life was crazy
rosa and betty are sitting in a booth talking over drinks
the place is a little quieter now
rosa contd so well hit the library first and fan out from there
theyve got all the l
phone books plus medical directories
were not gonna let him hide from you any more okay
im making this my personal mission
david isnt hiding from me i left him standing at the altar six years ago and now im
fuck the details theyre always to blame
look too many of these guys duck out on us especially after they become doctors or lawyers
i see it at my company all day long
so im just gonna make sure you get your you know fairy tale ending or whatever
one of us should
rosa i cant believe youre doing all this for me
rosa glances over to see betty pass a business card to a waiter who checks on them
when he is safely gone rosa touches betty on the sleeve
hey how bout a card for me
what is that
takes one reads please call if you have any information on david ravell
this is my phone number
how many of these have you given out
how many men have i talked to
theyre all gonna be calling me
you said in l
i was talking about what you could wear
the town cars parked on a barren stretch of desert highway white smoke billowing from the hood
half a mile ahead charlie and wesley are walking in the sweltering heat
theyre in their shirtsleeves drenched in sweat as the sun beats down on them
see in a lesabre bettys probably getting twenty two maybe twenty five miles to the gallon where were topping out at fifteen
shes probably all cool and fresh and comfortable in that nice air conditioned car right now
wesley wipes the sweat from his eyes and trudges on in silence
charlie takes out a photo of betty and speaks to it
charlie contd you dont look comfortable here
thats cause you dont like being the center of attention do you
youre like me
what the hells the matter with you
wesley grabs the photo tears it in half and tosses it
then he starts walking
charlie is stunned for a moment but recovers quickly
he finds the pieces and stuffs them in his pocket then catches up to wesley
that was a really shitty thing to do
im sick of looking at her mother fucking face
they walk for a moment
dont talk like that
shes my last one wesley my final target
to photo dont you realize your special that you represent something
this is too much
what does she represent
what could some cornbread white bitch from kansas whos dragging our sorry asses up and down the louisiana purchase possibly mean to you
id just love to know
why is she doing this to me
i dont know but when we find her shes gonna die for it
the lincoln town car is raised up high on the hydraulic jack
wesley is at a pay phone out front
can you describe her to me
yeah that sounds like her
he hangs up and goes into the garage where he addresses the town car above him
wesley contd they found her in vegas
wesley contd perfect match on the description
lying across the front seat taping the reassembled photo of betty to the dash
charlies beginning to come apart
his hair is uncombed and his clothes are wrinkled
his eyes have a thousand yard stare
sounds like shes with the buyer del lined up
charlie pulls himself up on the door and looks down
howd they describe her
you know blonde thin whatever
not so fast
blonde thin yes
did they say she had style
a kind of grace or anything
wesley rolls his eyes then goes straight to the levers controlling the hydraulic jack
to mechanic how do i get this fucking thing down
i wouldnt if i were you
he got pretty upset when i tried it
mercedes lopez early s impeccably dressed enters her office loaded down with a bulging briefcase and a stack of files under her arms
the entire scene is in spanish
what do you think my father would do if i told him i didnt want to be a lawyer anymore
probably the same thing my mom would do if i got engaged
have a heart attack
so hows it going with your new roomie
whats her name
except im worn out
we spent all weekend looking for her
how can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself
so tell her to settle for the old one in orange county
shes gonna have to cause im out of ideas
maybe were suing him for malpractice
whats his name again
god that sounds so familiar
wheres he out of
im not sure now
she said he used to be over at loma vista
i never heard of it
laughs you mean like the guy on a reason to love
rosa enters tosses her purse on the table and goes straight to the vcr
written in magic marker on a video is a reason to love apr
the tape sue ann gave to betty
she pops it in and turns it on
the opening titles start
the characters appear
one is an impossibly handsome man over the title doctor david ravell
betty working at a desk in the pharmacy
the same clerk as before busies himself at another counter
rosa appears at the glass partition and raps urgently on it
guess who i saw today
doctor david ravell
where was he
off bettys puzzled look cut the shit will you
rosa slams the videotape down on the counter
either youre making a fool out of me because you get off on it or you got serious problems
which one is it
i have no idea what youre talking about
i heard you the first time
suddenly calm i spent my weekend looking for someone who does not exist
i should have been here at the hospital with my brother but i was with you
if you didnt want to do it you should have said so
is this about gas money
you have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera and we searched all over town for his character
not the actor whose name is george by the way
rosa stands over betty fuming
are you having a nervous breakdown
rosa screams and smacks her hand on the glass as betty watches
several people in a nearby lounge look up
rosa stares at them until they look away
betty contd whyd you help me in the first place
i helped you because im an idiot
ask my mother i love it when people take advantage of me
i trusted you
i betty tries to return to her work but rosa confronts her loudly
the nearby visitors and staff pretend to be busy
you need help betty
even if this is your idea of a joke you need serious walking away to herself necesitas un mdico
fuming in her humiliation
after a moment rosa reappears at the window
rosa contd im not going back on our arrangement
my word is good and my family owes you
but i think its best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can
roy and joyce approach the door to the trailer office
she takes out her key then stops
its been padlocked and barred with yellow police tape as is the whole lot
roy pulls hard on the lock then starts looking around
youre wastin your time roy
look joyce i need your key to the files not advice okay
this is a complex case
roy works on opening a side window
nothin complex about it
dels dead bettys gone
shes probably dead too
youd like that wouldnt you
youve hated betty since you were in pep squad together
ahh i hate this town
places like this just make you small
i should have never come back here after college
blah blah blah
hurry up will ya i got a date tonight
roy forces the glass open and starts to squirm through the window as joyce watches
joyce contd i dont know what you think youll find anyway
names a phone number something
listen ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from detroit was murdered but do you see him doing anything about it
if ballard wasnt such a stubborn ass i wouldnt have to be breaking in here
the color drains from joyces face
what did you say
the driver was killed
i think theres a connection starting to cry no about
are you talking about duane cooley
why you know him
crying know him
we were gonna get married
he was gonna leave his wife for me
joyce begins to sob at the side of the trailer as roy shimmies through the window frame
suddenly ballard is there weapon cocked and placed roughly into roys privates
joyce backs away
i know you dont use them but if you wanna keep em youll back out of there slowly
roy is in the rear of the car handcuffed to the screen dividing the front seat from the back
ballard is driving
come on elden think about it
the driver all them trunks standing open like that
somethings going on here
i know that
well do something then damnit
you watch your mouth when youre in a goddamn county vehicle
you dont think i see whats going on
del now this cooley fella both of em mixed up with joyce
s not no conspiracy not some episode off the x files
s just a crime of passion plain and simple
bettys on some kinda pre minstral rampage thats what is going on here
a moment of silence as they drive
did you have to make these things so tight
no i didnt have to
he grins at roy in the rearview mirror
mercedes lopez arrives at the office and stops at rosas desk
the entire scene is in spanish hey
is betty still trying to find that soap opera guy
man id love to find that actor just to see the look on her face watch her bubble burst in mid air
mercedes hands her two tickets to a benefit
heres your needle
hes supposed to make an appearance here tonight
bettys lying on her bed reading modern nurse
times classifieds are open on the bed
rosa looks in
dont worry im looking
just taking a tiny break
this is crazy
i come home you go to your room
you go in the kitchen i go to my room
betty nods in agreement
rosa contd so what do you say
can we be friends
rosa smiles and starts looking at the tickets in her hand
betty contd what are those for
oh its a charity dinner
the money goes to a good cause but i dont have anybody to go with
rosa exits for a moment then reappears in the doorway
you hungry at all
the car is covered in dust and mud from the road
its worse inside food wrappers empty bottles pieces of clothing filthy windows
theyve been living in it
wesleys driving now
charlies almost unrecognizable a six day beard uncombed greasy hair bloodshot eyes rumpled clothes and an exhausted faraway look
the photo of betty faces him taped to the glove box
he is reading from the diary which he clutches like the bible
they roar along a desert highway passing a sign that says grand canyon this exit
charlie looks up marking his place
we should go
we dont have time to look at a hole in the ground
we can make vegas in four hours
this ones got to be her
its a very moving experience trust me
one of the seven natural wonders of the world
be dark before we get there
you wanna see the grand canyon at night
what difference does it make
she wasnt in kansas city or houston or dallas
went to every goddamn place del mentioned and no betty
so what the hell makes you think shes in vegas
you think shes waiting for us with tassles on her titties
vegas is too crass for betty
i said no
charlie turns to a passage and reads aloud
when i grow up im going to become a nurse or a veterinarian
i always want to help people and value all life be it animal plant or mineral
to wesley does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you
do you hear yourself right now
like a fucking madman
wesley drives on stoically
the exit comes and goes
every american should see the grand canyon
are you an american
yes i am and were not going
charlie stares at him hate rising from just below the surface
he draws a nickel plated pistol and points it at wesleys head
wesley looks at it and keeps on driving
charlie knows this isnt the way to handle it
he lowers the pistol
if you dont take the next turn for the canyon im blowing my goddamn brains all over this car
he puts the pistol in his mouth and cocks it
wesley looks over not so sure this time
long shot of the black town car as the turn signal comes on and it eases onto a lonely dirt road
their headlights pick out a sign that says grand canyon fire trail
forestry personnel only
rosa and betty approach the hotel entrance
ahead of them a black lincoln town car pulls up
headlights glint on the chrome hitting betty in the eye
she freezes and rosa bumps into her
betty stares at the car unable to remember what it should mean
then a man in a tuxedo gets out
betty moves on
a sign on an easel reads save the children
betty and rosa present their tickets at the door to a ballroom
several times there is a stir near the entrance and a scattering of flashbulbs
rosa scans the crowd
looking for someone
you never know who youll see
rosa keeps looking
finally george mccord the actor who plays david ravell enters
he comes in with lyla branch late s and two other men
several women approach george some starry eyed for quick polite greetings
hes doing his job of being a soap star
rosa waits for an opening then puts her hands on bettys shoulders and points her at george
rosa contd look whos here
bettys jaw drops
rosa contd what are you waiting for
talk to him
you came fifteen hundred miles for this
rosa prods her then betty makes her way unsteadily toward george
when shes a few feet away he looks up
he cant help but notice her shes beautiful
shes also looking right into his eyes
the conversation stops as he does a double take in bettys direction
do i know you from
his friends watch as george studies her face
of course you do
hurt you dont remember me
i take it i should
we were engaged
oh good another one
georges friends look at each other
a few heads turn
i beg your pardon
but im the one whos sorry
letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life
to his friends we were thirteen days away from getting married and
i just got scared
its a mistake ive had to live with for six years
but its behind me now
to george and i hope you can put it behind you
ive missed you
george sighs with relief
his friends smile
the tension evaporates
they can handle a fanatical fan
thats very kind of you
the day i left you i just drove and drove
i drove all day and all that night and i didnt go anywhere
i just kept driving
i stopped at a little country church and the pastor let me in and i sat in the very first pew where we would have sat on our wedding day
betty looks at her
so does george
lyla contd i cant believe i remembered that although i suppose i should
i wrote it
to betty but that was seven years ago and youre quoting it verbatim
whats your name
what do you mean you wrote it
im lyla branch
im the producer
they shake hands
across the room rosa watches expectantly
lyla contd alright i admit it you had me there
youre better than most of them anyway
do you have a headshot
what happened next betty
are you sure you want to encourage this
no youre right lets have some fun
so what did happened next betty
well david moved out here and started his residency
then he met leslie no no no
we know all that
what happened with you
i married a car salesman
the friends laugh
rosa watches confused
so is betty
you were dumped for a car salesman george
why are you calling him george
yeah david tell us about this car salesman
george likes the challenge
this party isnt so boring after all
oh you mean fred
del was one hot salesman
he could talk anyone into anything
you knew del
honey i didnt want to tell you at the time but del and i go way back
we went to school together
in fact he saved my life
two more minutes in that icy water and i would have drowned
but del jumped in and grabbed me
we fell out of touch eventually but i still owe him one
he never told me anything about
funny thats just what i was thinking
i cant tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him
his friends snicker
betty is oblivious to everything but george
im so sorry
life makes us do awful things sometimes
shes ready to cry
which only inspires him all the more
i tried to tell myself it was for the best that there was a reason behind it
there was no plan
i was just young and stupid and scared
you never gave us a chance
i know that
i cant tell you how many times ive said that to myself in those exact words
betty wipes her tears away as they flow freely now
george doesnt like seeing her cry he tries to say something but his friends interrupt
come on i was just
youre not really crying are you
i was just playing along
now look what youve done george
why do they keep calling you george
i dont know
why do you keep calling me george
listen david its getting late
george hesitates lyla sees it
to betty right uhh
i feel terrible about this we have a prior engagement at another party
id be honored if youd come
yeah bring your friend along
im sure you got a lot of catching up to do
rosa watches stunned as betty waves to her as she leaves arm in arm with the man of her dreams
the town car is parked near one of the viewing stops at the rim
charlie stands in the darkness but wesley stays in the car
you dont know what youre missing asshole
charlie walks toward the canyon rim
suddenly betty appears in the headlights standing at the rail her back to charlie with a bouquet of flowers
just as he closes his eyes to rest the car phone rings
is this neighborly life insurance
recovering oh umm yes this is dwight campbell
its sue ann rogers betty sizemores friend
i heard from her
walking toward the rail
as he nears her they kiss
suddenly repeated blasts from the car horn
the image of betty shudders then blurs then fades away entirely
charlie rubs at his eyes tiredly then slowly trudges back toward the car
charlie returns and gets into the car
wesley stares at him
you have a good time
you make a little wish
silence from charlie
wesley contd well guess what
i found betty
where shes been anyway
where is she
im not telling
im not telling til you straighten up
you been acting like fucking jerry lewis on me and this shits gotta stop or you can forget about your betty
i mean it
a slow transformation comes over charlie
wesley im fine
just tell me where she is
george betty lyla and the two friends are waiting outside the hotel for their cars
i bought a car from del too
he sold me a lemon
i put a hundred and thirty thousand miles on mine
i had no idea our little lot was so popular
i never bought a car from del
but i loved him
in my own way
i guess we all did
to betty you know i didnt marry leslie because i loved her
i married her to forget you
im sorry i caused you that much pain
a black jeep x pulls up and eric augustino the actor who plays lonnie gets out
betty contd oh my god
whats lonnie doing here
youre late eric
why are you guys leaving
we did our twenty minutes
before eric can take another step betty slaps him across the face
flashbulbs go off as photographers capture the moment
how can you even show your face around here
do you think were not onto you
who the hell is this
she thinks youre someone else
george hustles betty to his car as photographers continue to shoot
i know exactly who you are
the lincoln town car rumbles into the dusty parking lot and parks
this doesnt look like the kind of place betty would go to
maybe she had to use the bathroom
she pees doesnt she
wesley tears the photo of betty from the glove box
be careful with that
charlie takes it back and gingerly secures the tape
merle is at the bar drunk the only customer on a slow night
ellen drops two coasters in front of charlie and wesley as they sit down
what can i get you
were federal marshals maam
ellen looks dubiously at their unshaven faces and rumpled clothes
were looking for this young lady
he slides the photo of betty across the bar
ellens gaze drops to the picture for a second and charlie sees what he was looking for a flicker of recognition
he allows himself a satisfied grin
wesley shows ellen his badge as merle checks out the photo
i havent seen her
sure you have
shut up merle
charlie continues to grin at ellen
maam if youve seen this woman betty
thats her name betty
charlie takes the photo and puts it back in his pocket
i never saw that woman before and neither has merle
he drinks too much
and dont try to tell me youre cops
was married to a cop for nine years and youre not cops
now get out of here
wesley steps behind merle takes a handful of his hair and slams his head into the popcorn machine on the bar
merle staggers away stunned
wesley removes the tin popcorn scoop from a nearby hook
ellen reaches for something under the bar but charlies faster
he pins her arm with one hand
you havent been very forthcoming with us
they watch wesley follow merle at a slow walk around the pool table clobbering him over the head about every five steps with the popcorn scoop
merle wobbles with every shot but wont go down
they begin a torturous second lap around the table punctuated by the clang of the scoop against merles head
whats your name dear
thats a nice name
after one more clanging shot merle staggers then falls
wesley walks over to charlie and ellen drawing his knife
thats a really nice name
george and betty are alone
lylas very nice
yes she is
she told me i was charming and relentless and would go far in this town
and she said that unlike the other charming relentless people she knew she liked me
shes a good person to know
so where did you study again

i think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago

he pulls up in front of rosas apartment and parks
betty contd i havent been this happy since i was twelve years old
what happened when you were twelve
for mothers day i used all my allowance that id been saving to take my mother to kansas city
we got our nails done and had lunch at skies a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city
it was the last outing we took together
she died the following year

you make it all sound so real
i just want everything to be perfect between us
listen we need to take a time out here
can we talk seriously for a minute
i know how much you want this
youre gifted and extremely determined but
its not up to me
its up to us
betty leans over and kisses george so deeply that hes too surprised to react
she pulls away abruptly and gets out
betty contd i love you david
and i want to see you tomorrow and the next day and the next day
still surprised and now a little intrigued he watches her go inside
betty comes in and pours a drink from the fridge
rosa appears in a nightshirt behind her framed in the doorway

you scared me
you still in love
does he know you think hes real
he is real
so whatd you talk about
oh my gosh everything
my trip out here what weve both been doing you know

to a party in the hollywood hills
was it a huge place
with a view of the whole world
id never been in a place like that before
i have lots of times
my mother used to clean them
i used to piss in their pools
rosa gets up and starts for her bedroom
rosa contd this isnt fair you know
do you always get what you want
no almost never
but youre in love with someone who doesnt exist
you come here you meet this guy who should laugh in your face and instead you leave with him
betty you are one of a kind
rosa goes into her bedroom and closes the door
betty smiles and nods sipping at her drink as she retires to her room
from his cell roy ostrey hears a door open then the sound of approaching footsteps
elden let me out of here
this is ridiculous i need medical attention
thats a nice name for what you need
come on i have to get this dressing off
and what about my fish
who is taking care of them
ballard doesnt say anything
hes very grim subdued
roy has never seen him like this
just shut up a second and listen
that bar in arizona
where you said betty was
what about it
any idea where it is
little place called williams why
i just got something off the wire
the woman who owns it was murdered last night
now im not saying i agree with you or nothing but
what else do you know
i know plenty
lyla is sitting in the inner court of her lloyd wright home with george at one knee
she makes me stretch
i got inside my character last night like i havent done in six years on reason
it was a totally rejuvenating experience
i know george i was there
im not denying that shes good
shes even taken a job as a nurse
david ravells getting boring lyla
we know that
can i have an evil twin
no george weve already done that with lonnie
the blind one last year remember
oh of course
who can forget the emmy
then let me bring betty to the set and see what happens
i dont know george

you and i can break the mold here
i said ill think about it

if we use her i want to direct those episodes
shes my discovery
actually she was my discovery
just like you
would you like ground pepper on that salad ms
the black lincoln town car hurdles along the freeway a revitalized charlie back at the wheel
surrounded by traffic the lights of the city in the distance the two men push on toward their new destination
the black lincoln town car now washed and gleaming is parked in front of a modest motel
charlie looks like a new man showered clear eyed and energized hes at the sink shaving as wesley watches from his seat on the edge of the bathtub
so you believed the bartender
i think i saw her soul
but let me tell you why i know she was lying
first off betty would never fall for a soap star
its beneath her
i dunno that lady sounded pretty sure
no no betty came here strictly for business cause its the biggest market for what shes selling
i should have known it all along
im kicking myself as i shave here
so first thing we
wait wait wait a minute
that doesnt make sense
you gimme this bullshit psychic friends theory you believe that dumbshit trucker you believe this woman
i never said that i believed
no you believed her we drove all the way to l
so that means you trusted her that much
so whys the rest of her story suddenly so kooky
cause i just dont buy it
call it instinct
call it years of professional know how
i call it nutty as my shit after i eat almond roca
you need to remember who youre talking to
i need to get my goddamn head examined
you cant rule something out on a whim
or because shes cute
ive been following your whims all across the u
and now im tired
its beneath her
shes a mother fucking housewife
nothings beneath her
wesley stands up for emphasis pointing a finger in charlies personal space
charlie reacts at this throwing his razor into the sink and turning on wesley
boy you need to get outta my face
you got a feeling then you do what you gotta do but dont you ever try to tell me my job
its a standoff
wesley blinks first
he stalks off and out of sight
in a moment he returns
ill go check some shit on my own then
and dont call me boy
he turns and slams into the door frame
he glares at charlie then exits
when the front door bangs shut allows himself to go back to his shaving
map in hand wesley stand near a guard and discreetly asks questions
what kinda cars jasmine drive
ahh mercedes i think
the sport utility
damn thats sweet
she really that good looking in person
wesley looks around covertly then produces a fifty
wesley contd hey can you sneak me on the lot
wesley smiles and wanders off headed toward a series of studio buildings in the distance
the guard watches him go
guard contd its sunday i can sneak anybody on the lot
charlie toys with matches from the canyon ranch bar
working off a list of names and phone numbers from his zaurus he makes calls from his room
betty sizemore shes got ten kilos
blonde hair a great figure
sort of a whole doris day thing going on
thats what i said doris day
you could see her working at the u
nobody like that
yeah detroit by way of kansas
alright let me know if you hear anything okay
he hangs up
deletes another one off the list and looks out the window
checks the now well worn photo of betty
hes starting to doubt himself
rosa stands in the doorway as betty wearing one of rosas hotter outfits puts on her makeup
are you sure i can borrow this
go ahead its your funeral
well what if this guys just playing with you
what if hes lying about who he is
you should have a little faith in people
does he ever talk about medicine
his patients the hospital
all the time
its always loma vista this loma vista that
the doorbell rings
rosa goes to the front door and looks through the peephole then opens the door
george mccord flowers in hand gives his best leading man smile
you must be rosa
ive heard so much about you
im george mccord
not as much as ive heard about you
shes a very nice girl and you better not hurt her
rosa so youve met david
and a funny thing betty he introduced himself to me as george
oh he does that
hugging him its this silly game he plays
half the people who know him call him george
i dont think your friend likes me
shes a little jealous i think
and confused when it comes to men
so where are we going
well first i thought patina and then the ivy but then i thought of somewhere a little more romantic
like my place
modern glass and steel structure in the hills
betty and george sit on the sofa with the lights low and soft music playing
god i havent felt like this since i was with stella adler in new york
he leans forward slowly to kiss her but betty pulls back
you never mentioned a stella to me
no i would have remembered that name
the only stella i ever knew was a parrot
was this before leslie
george takes her face in his hands and looks at her
ive never met anyone like you betty
i know thats why we were meant to be together
no i mean your dedication scares me
its easy to be dedicated when you care about something
yeah i felt that way too when i first started but now
the hours the repetition
its not all glamour and mall openings anymore
maybe i shouldve listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier i dont know
i just hope its not too late for me
listen to me me me me
its so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself
thats it no more about me tonight i promise
lets talk about you
what do you think about me
seriously betty im doing all the talking here
but i love listening to you so thats okay
but id like to hear what youre feeling
well i just feel that lifell be much sweeter for you now with me around
you know i almost believe that
youre like a warm breeze thats suddenly blown into my life
laughs i said that to leslie once at her funeral remember
you said it to her but it was meant for me wasnt it
maybe it was
she kisses him deeply then allows herself to fall back on the sofa pulling george down on top of her and kissing him passionately
wesley hands charlie a newspaper folded open to the entertainment section where there is a picture of betty slapping the actor eric augustino
george is in b
so im standing there minding my own business on hollywood blvd
checking out gladys knights star thing there i look up at this little souvenir shop dude chinese dude reading a paper
and who do i see
holding up paper thats lonnie
hes the shows main prick
and that is definitely betty
now that aint no coincidence
i found out where they shoot it and where the dressing rooms are
charlie studies the photo troubled by something
a doctor on the show
charlie thinks about it then reaches into his pocket and takes out the photo of betty with the cardboard david
as he compares the photos wesley peeks over his shoulder
wesley contd what in the
simmering what the hell is this
youve been holding out on me
all this fucking time
it just didnt fit her profile
fuck the profile
thats the same guy
she cant be here because of a
a soap opera
not a soap opera
thatd make her
no shit shaft
and you aint far behind
but shes no bettys smarter than that
she wouldnt be here for a
i do not know how the fuck you lasted an hour in this job
dragging our asses around with the answer to our prayers in your motherfucking jacket
a picture of that cunt right next to the
charlie cuts wesley short by grabbing his shirt and pulling him close
dont dont you talk about betty like that
i dont care who she ends up being you never use that word again
man you have got to get some therapy
i said got it
yeah i got it
struggling come on youre stretching out my vest
you made your point
drops him i was wrong
he carefully folds the paper pockets the photo and straightens his clothing
he straps on his holster and checks his weapon for emphasis
charlie contd now get yourself ready
wesley gathering his gear through the open door
charlie stands looking at himself in the mirror
touches at the gray in his hair
as an afterthought he tosses on a splash of cologne
george leads betty past several standing sets and into the operating room as crew members buzz around
betty walks with her eyes closed and holding georges hand
just a little further
george stops and puts both hands over bettys eyes
he looks about expectantly and then uncovers them with a flourish
george contd surprise
betty stares slowly trying to take in her new surroundings
it looks like loma vista but something is different
cameras lights etc
all the apparatus of a tv show are in plain sight
and very disorienting
oh my gosh
i didnt know i was going to meet your friends today
i dressed a little casual
he leads her to a taped mark on the floor as cast members appear including jasmine and blake daniels
listen you got the part and im directing
youve only got four lines today so i thought id just spring it on you
no blocking or anything just stand near the nurses station
were gonna do a quick walk through
he kisses her cheek and walks off toward the waiting lyla before she can respond
quiet on the set
traffic was terrible
no thats fine weve only got seventy pages to shoot
take your time
a stage manager hands betty a set of sides and an on set costumer tries to fit her
what are you doing
well get you into hair and make up after this just put this on
the other actors take their positions
lyla watches from behind the cameras as david readies himself
chloe enters the set with kleenex tucked into the neck of her costume
to betty hi
i hear youre great
what are you doing here
your linesll are in the script but you can ad lib
in fact i want you to ad lib thats the magic im after
i wanna give a whole new feel to the show
shes sliding toward a complete meltdown
george steps back behind the cameras
bettys still frozen to her spot overwhelmed
just do what youve been doing
watch the scene and on your cue take off from there
chloe and blake run through their lines lifelessly then stop when they get to bettys cue
their faces loom around her menacingly
the lights are impossibly bright
people begin to shuffle and stare at one another
lyla clears her throat as george bounds on stage still smiling
are you all right
to chloe i think you stepped on my first line
i was talking to her
to betty do you need anything
shes freezing up
george approaches her
betty i thought this would be the best way
you know throw you into it
what the hells going on
if you need a minute thats okay
but i thought youd want to
david i dont
can we talk privately for a second
stop calling me david
were on set for christs sake you dont have to call me david here
as he pulls away betty grabs his arm
why are you doing this to me
why am i doing this to you
isnt this what you wanted
is there a problem george
no problem there is no
to betty sotto what is the problem
just do that
you drove me nuts with this for three days now do it
george steps back behind the cameras as if nothings wrong
betty still hasnt moved
shes shaking with fear
the cast and crew members find it hard to look at her
all right everybody
thats ten minutes
let me try this
storming off this is bullshit
forget it george
it was a gamble it didnt work
let me try this goddamnit
george throws down his script and rushes up to betty who reaches out to him
he brushes her hands away
well i dont know what you had in mind but i hope youre happy
i put myself on the line for you my reputation and youre making me look like an idiot
what do you mean
what did i do to you
who put you up to this
did my ex wife ask you to
david please betty begins to cry
leave her alone george
shut the fuck up
youre a fucking grip go grip something
to betty and youre not an actress youre nothing but a soap opera groupie arent you
well why dont you get a fucking life and stop ruining mine
betty stands dead still as george continues to berate her
all sound slowly starts to drop out then comes back abruptly with a rush
suddenly a light snaps on for her and she stares at him
oh my gosh are you george mccord
what did you call me
youre my favorite actor on
she called you george george
did i win some contest
but im david
i mean im not david but she thinks i am
you heard her
looking around the group stop staring at me
im not crazy she is
why are you screaming at me
i mean what am i
why am i here
youre doing this now
after all the
are you sick
are you going to kill me now
forgive me if i caused you all any trouble
i just i dont know how i
to george im sorry
george watches betty walk off the set
the cast and crew try to pretend this scene didnt happen except for lyla who burns a hole into georges back
their eyes meet
george mccord wearing sunglasses and still angry strides into the lobby
charlie and wesley stand quickly and take out their badges as he approaches
what can i do for you gentlemen
how do you do mr
were trying to locate a deranged fan of yours
that would be the right word
wesley takes out the photo of betty
george contd that wont be necessary
shes staying with a rosa something
i know its an h sound
thanks so much
you must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot
more than you know
is there anything else
no that should be more than good
george turns to leave
actually there is one more thing
wesley is suddenly shy hesitant
wesley contd its just
i watch the show too and you being dr
ravell and all i thought you could maybe get jasmine to come out here
you thought wrong
george pulls away
wesley grabs his sleeve
its just for an autograph
its not for me
it never is
george wrenches free of wesleys grip and takes off
wesley is furious
he catches george in two strides spins him around and slaps him across the face
georges glasses go skittering across the floor
you need to learn some manners friend
reach out to your goddamn fan base a little more
charlie pulls wesley away
george is frozen to the spot humiliated a pink handprint emerging on his cheek
wesley contd and i saw your movie of the week
it sucked dick
betty walks aimlessly along a busy street
she moves without direction in a daze until a glint of bright light hits her causing her to turn
she is staring at a black lincoln sitting in a car lot sunlight dancing off its chrome
she shudders involuntarily at it
suddenly she hears a familiar voice
what the hell are you doing here
hes in a pastel version of his usual shirt slacks and tie
del contd well are you gonna answer me
whatd you come here for
i came for love
youre not on that soap opera thing again are you
cause you know what that is
its people with no lives watching other peoples fake lives
so if you know it why are you in trouble
i dont know
you sure dont
who do you think you are coming to hollywood anyway
you should remember where you came from
and who you really are
del looks up at the sun for a moment shading his eye from it
del contd i gotta run
got some serious clients to meet with real potential
goddamn its hot
he wipes the sweat from his brow
betty looks at his handkerchief and sees that its soaked in blood
then back at his face now obscured by blood pouring down from his head
she stares horrified and in that moment del becomes
a man staring back at her as he wipes the sweat from his brow
who are you talking to
are you crazy
betty backs away and melts into the flow of pedestrians
rosa comes home from work and tosses her purse and jacket on the chair
no betty in her room
did the pizza guy show up yet
she emerges from rosas bedroom with toiletries and moves to an open suitcase in her room
she barely acknowledges rosa
rosa contd are you all right
no answer what happened
he dumped you didnt he
i knew it when i met him
hes a loser like the rest of them
rosa now notices betty packing
rosa contd what are you doing
im going back to
i need to
i dont know
rosa tries to stop betty for a moment to talk
betty grabs a pile of rosas clothes and heads for her room
betty contd this is your sweater right
where are you going
i have to leave now
she tries to put bettys suitcase away
no im not gonna let you just run out of here
you need to talk about whats going on
you think im crazy rosa but you dont know the half of it
my husband was ahh
yes i had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen
i was right there
what are you saying
they stare at each other for a beat
rosa contd what
that you had something to do with it
i dont know
im just starting to remember it now
yeah but your running away isnt going to help you with all this
there was blood everywhere rosa
i saw it i think i watched the whole thing happen
oh my god
okay okay look ummm
lets just talk a little first and youll feel better i promise
the doorbell rings
rosa contd thats our pizza
you cant go yet
charlie watches betty undress from a nearby fire escape
he stares at the object of his desperate search with relief and some fascination
bettys movements are unhurried mindless
charlie stares mesmerized until she steps into the shower
wesley gently nudges open the trunk to bettys lesabre
the cardboard cut out of david ravell pops out at him
what the fuckre you doing here
he breaks it over his knee and throws it in the gutter then quickly removes the wing nut holding the spare tire
he removes the tire then raises the panel on the floor of the trunk as charlie joins him
wesley contd its all here
it hasnt been touched
the bottom of the trunk is lined with brown paper wrapped bricks of cocaine
charlie stares at it shaking his head
wesley contd you were right
del wasnt lying
well you were right about what that bartender said
wesley looks at him
he appreciates the compliment
but you were right first
you gotta follow your instincts
charlie takes a long look at wesley and smiles proudly
what do your instincts tell you to do now kid
take this shit back to detroit and get the rest of our money
we could do that
i could be on my way to florida and you could go to thailand and fuck your brains out
but thats not what were gonna do is it
if we dont finish this job how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror
this is it for me wesley shes the last one
my instinct says i gotta see this through with her and if theres one thing ive tried to teach you here its to follow my instincts
and my instincts say get the fuck out of dodge
no i said to follow my instincts
now we go up there and conclude our business
charlie walks off
wesley closes the trunk up and prepares to follow him
oh thats fucking democratic
at the sound of the buzzer rosa goes to the door
she looks through the peephole and sees charlie holding up a badge
im detective jefferson oh
did betty call you
rosa opens the door and he enters with wesley
shes got problems but shes no killer
i hope you guys can straighten this out
charlie and wesley exchange a puzzled look
well do what we can
where is she
to the men please go easy on her
shes had a really rough day
she recognizes the men instantly and freezes
charlies eyes wander over her
rosa contd these guys are here to help you betty
i dont think so
rosa i didnt kill del
wesley produces a pistol sitting rosa forcibly on the sofa and tapes her mouth and hands
charlie walks over to betty
we meet again
he moves closer to her
wesley steps in and quickly tapes her hands
charlie stops him
charlie contd not her mouth
to betty ive spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me
ive seen it painted on the horizon
to charlie whats wrong with you
a knock at the door ruins charlies moment
thats our pizza
wesley hustles rosa out of the room
get rid of them
betty nods scared and looks through the peephole
she stares with disbelief at roy ostrey
he knocks again
she opens the door a crack
boy am i glad to see you
what are you doing here
youre in serious danger
ahh look right nows not very
i woulda been here sooner but ballard put me in jail
he still thinks you had del scalped
i never said that
open the door betty
ballard shoves roy aside charlies getting edgy
sheriff i dont
cmon betty open up
i got some questions for you about
have you checked the trunk of that car youre driving betty
i think there might be
its not really a good time guys
dont give me that
ive come two thousand miles for this
charlie has been listening quietly on the other side of the door and finally snaps
two thousand miles
he flings the door open sticks a pistol in ballards face and yanks them both inside
charlie contd hah
you probably flew
ive crossed the river styx looking for her pal
i travelled the fucking country to be here
charlie slams the door and frisks them taking a gun and handcuffs from ballard
wesley returns with rosa
charlie contd to betty who are these idiots
this is roy ostrey hes a reporter
and this is sheriff ballard
we all went to fair oaks high together
oh this is wonderful
wesley takes over
he sits rosa down on the sofa then pushes betty down next to her and beckons to roy
he breaks roys nose with his pistol
roy crumples to the floor holding his face
betty starts to scream but charlie puts his hand over her mouth
wesley tapes roys hands together then beckons to ballard
wesley contd your turn
ballard drops to his knees in a prayer like position near the aquarium
i got two kids and a dog
wesley grabs his shirtfront and slams him to the floor then with a foot on his neck he loops ballards arms around one leg of the steel aquarium stand and
charlie does nothing but stare at betty his eyes locked with hers
wesley sees it
act professional remember
charlie pulls her to her feet
wesley contd what are you doing
charlie leads betty out of the room
wesley contd no way
this is not professional
then charlie takes out a knife and cuts the tape from bettys wrists touching her hair
he leaves her standing in the corner while he sits on the edge of the bed
i spose you did that so i could take my sweater off or something
no just stand there
lemme look at you a minute
charlie stares intently at her
charlie contd do you know who i am
i know what you are
do you know why im here
ive got a pretty good idea
youre here to kill me so kill me
you want me to be afraid but im not
i dont care who you are or why you two killed my husband
charlie studies her then sets his gun down on the bed
didnt have anything to do with what del was doing did you
i have no idea what he was mixed up in
it was always something
so you werent involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify
off her blank look were you mixed up in the drugs betty
im totally against drugs
damn life is strange
i had you figured for this cold blooded calculating bitch not that i didnt admire you for it
charlie slowly folds his knife and pockets it
well if youre not going to slit my throat whyd you come up here
to see you
wesley stands over ballard about to tape his mouth
rosa and roy are sitting in chairs opposite them their mouths and wrists already taped
you killed that bartender in arizona and the trucker in texas didnt you
how did you find betty
i just put it all together
i knew david lonnie and chloe were from that show
roy starts freaking out trying to talk through the tape
ballard contd betty thinks theyre real people
it sounded crazy but it was worth a shot
roy is apoplectic
what do you want
wesley tears his tape off
thats a lie
i figured it out
ive been trying to tell this dumbass fuck you roy ostrey
small time pissant barney fife shut up
shut the fuck up both of you before i kill you
im the one who watched the show
did chloe crack
she came apart like a house of cards
they dropped the charges
how bout jasmine
shes a lesbian
wesley immediately pulls his gun and points it at roys head
you lie motherfucker
i swear to god
rosa stamps her feet drawing wesleys attention
she tries to talk through the duct tape gestures for him to come to her
you scream you die
he yanks the tape off
i have a tape of todays show
betty is sitting on the bed
charlie leans against the wall facing her
he has trouble starting this
i never meet people like you
im a garbageman of the human conditon
i deal with trash mostly people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives
you could probably have any thing you wanted
somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself and you dont even realize it
betty looks curiously over at charlie
charlie contd im appreciably older than you but my health is good
i take care of myself and i got some money socked away
youd never have to work agin thats for sure
id treat you like a queen
umm i dont think that
let me get this out
clears his throat i like the symphony walks in the rain sunsets animals and children
i read passionately and i like to discuss things
im basically conservative but flexible
ive been involved in the death of thirty two people but i can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty two pieces of shit excuse my language
well thirty three but im not counting del on account of you
so what do you think
you probably feel im flattering myself to see us together
i dont feel that no
im not really who you think i am
no one is honey
here listen to this
if who i am and who i hope to be should meet one day i know they will be friends
now thats beautiful
betty is stunned
i wrote that when i was twelve
whered you get that
he pulls out the diary i know
i borrowed it from your grandparents because i
it doesnt matter
dont worry theyre fine
he gives the diary back look i used to feel that same way said practically those same words sitting at night in a foxhole in korea
ive chased you across the country betty and i come to find out were a lot more alike than youd think
i thought you were a garbageman of humanity or something
yes but id sort of like to put that behind me now
wesley is engrossed in watching a reason to love
behind him ballard quietly walks his feet up the wall until hes completely upside down
he rubs one foot against the other until one pantleg is above his cowboy boot
rosa and roy watch
he finally lifts the boot off
it falls soundlessly onto his chest
a small pistol is revealed holstered above his ankle
he works the holster open using the edge of the fishtank
roy and rosa cough loudly at the same time to cover the noise
wesley glares at them
ballard gets the pistol free
but it falls into the fishtank
the air goes out of roys sails
ballard has fucked up again
on screen chloe and jasmine kiss and embrace
wesley reacts as if he was slapped
wesley immediately runs the sequence back to view it again
ballard kicks the wall of the fishtank with his cowboy boot
roy and rosa cover the sound again with coughing
wesley pauses the t
and looks around
wesley contd whats your problem
ballard kicks at the tank again
but he cant break the glass
roy cant take it any more
he launches himself at the tank grabs it by the rim and pulls it down on top of himself
a torrent of water fish plants and gravel pours down upon him
wesley contd you stupid piece of fuck
he leaps at roy and starts kicking him savagely
rosa throws herself onto wesleys back knocking him to the floor
ballard paws through the muck scattering fish and gravel everywhere
he spots a glint of metal in the sand
wesley struggles out from under rosa
just as he gets free ballard fires hitting him twice into his chest
wesley stares in disbelief at the blood rushing out of him
then at ballard as if trying to link the two
he slumps to the floor and opens his mouth to scream
wesley contd charlie opens the bedroom door
charlie sees wesley turn to him as ballard fires again
wesleys face explodes
the flying lead drives charlie back to the bedroom
crawling through the muck roy notices a fish flopping helplessly on the carpet inches from his face
thosere japanese koi
howd you know that
you gotta get em in water right away
were in a shootout roy
shut up about the damn fish
you shut up
to rosa theyre beautiful but get them some water
he gently hands her the fish then picks up wesleys nearby gun
rosa nods shes amazed that he knew what it was
she looks at roy in a slightly different way before crawling away toward the kitchen
charlie fires back from the doorway
oh christ they shot my boy
enraged he empties his pistol at the living room
ballard and roy return fire and charlie ducks back in
charlie contd reloading how the hell did this happen
im in a goddamn shoot out
what the fuck happened out there
he opens the door and a bullet slams into the doorjamb near his head
he ducks back in
charlie sags against the wall looking toward betty
charlie contd thats my son
my son is dead
youre the reason were charlie fights back his grief
betty contd what do you want from me
charlie cant handle the moment
he breaks for the door and blasts away
this time hes nicked in the shoulder
he stumbles back losing his balance
his gun falls and slides right into bettys hand
equally surprised they stare at one another
charlie slumps over in his defeat as betty holds a shaky pistol on him
rosa crawls to a flower vase and dumps a second koi into the water inside
roy and ballard crouch behind the open archway using the hanging beads as protection
checks his gun we need ammo
go check his jacket ill cover you
im not going out there
lets wait for the real police
you gotta go were pinned down
so why cant we just sneak outside
lady you dont just run away from crime
besides bettys in there
checking you wanna see if he has more shells go ahead
i say we wait
no no no
you dont know shit about procedure
you dont send your best
ive got the working gun elden me
you wasted all your bullets so you crawl out there
ballard stares at him in disbelief then back at the closed bedroom door
ballard starts off on his belly
a long beat passes
police sirens wail in the distance
betty moves close to charlie to look at his shoulder
he watches her intently
if we went out that window right now wed have a chance
i better go check on them
you still havent answered me
this is really awkward
the sirens are coming closer
he waves her off
ahh its too late anyway
its too late
listen i could shoot my way out maybe take one of them with me
if youd gimme my gun back
id rather not
betty i dont wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison
ive got some professional pride
and i dont want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out
whatre you saying
when a roman general knew a battle was lost hed throw himself on his sword
charlie fumbles in his pocket then pulls out the photo of betty with the cardboard david ravell
charlie contd did
did you really come here because you love this guy
not the actor though the doctor
charlies sinks slowly to the floor
so all this
really was because of that soap opera
my son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor
a fake doctor
i wouldnt have put it quite that way but
wesley didnt even want to come up here
he warned me but i insisted
i have to ask you betty
are you crazy
i dont think i am
charlie remains sitting pensively for a long beat
i want you to listen to me betty
people dont lie when theyre about to die
you dont need that doctor
you dont need that actor
you dont need any man
its not the forties honey
you dont need anybody
youve got yourself
and thats more than most people can say
charlie reaches out slowly and takes the gun from betty
she doesnt fight him
he kisses her hand and steps into the bathroom and closes the door
a single gunblast sends a shiver through betty
tv newscast close shot of an anchorman
in a story that police say is bizarre even for hollywood a father son team of killers tracked a kansas soap opera fan halfway across the country only to find
themselves the victims in a final bloody confrontation
the anchorman continues as the camera pulls back to reveal lyla and george watching television in a plush living room

we have nothing to lose by making her an offer
what about me
dont you wanna know how i feel about it
im the one who
why would i give a shit how you feel
and i got news for you
i loved your icy water idea the other day
with the idea of killing david ravell off in a boating accident
thats not a bad idea
how many episodes before he comes back
lyla shakes her head no
george contd jesus dont do that
if it gets around that you fired me ill never land a pilot
then do as youre told
get her back
george and betty sit across from one another in a booth
betty listens patiently
her former co workers try to remain busy but cant help gawking
im sorry for what i did
it was inexcusable
im sorry for the things i said and for not respecting you and for all the stupid things that
darlene approaches puts a piece of paper on the table
when you have a minute
look i dont really like the whole idea of autographs and im kind of in the middle of
dont flatter yourself
its the check
she walks off
grabbing it up my treat
you were saying
something about how stupid youve been
i was an idiot plain and simple and i hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me
kinda like youd been saying it since you got on the plane

the kids are out of control but sue anns oblivious
she leaps from her chair
