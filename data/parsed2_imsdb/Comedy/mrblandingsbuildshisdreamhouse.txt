leaning on a railing looking down into the excavation are a group of sidewalk supervisors
the camera moves up to a head closeup of one of them
it is bill cole melvyn douglas a well dressed intelligent attractive looking young man
i suppose youre wondering what all this has to do with mr
blandings and his dream house
well ill tell you
jim blandings is part of the fabric of this town
born and raised right here hes as typical a new yorker as anyone youll ever meet
at least he was
confidentially and if you want to know the real story i guess im your boy
coles my name bill cole
im jims lawyer and quote best friend unquote
jims one of those bright young men from yale
advertising business lovely wife two fine kids makes almost fifteen thousand a year
want to know why
just look up there
a billboard against a white background is a large ham
in large letters across the ham is printed and below this in quotes when youve got the whim say wham
jim blandings wrote that slogan
seven magic words that shine like a beacon light for the american housewife
impressive almost reverently when youve got the whim say wham
jim blandings contribution to the american scene
as camera moves up it and toward a window for fourteen years jim and muriel had been living in their apartment over on east seventy fourth street
it was just another of those wonderful crisp september mornings and the blandings were still asleep
just like millions of other people in good old manhattan new york city the camera goes through the window and into jim cary grant and muriel myrna loy blandings are
asleep in twin beds
the room not large to begin with gives us the impression of being cluttered up and overcrowded because the beds oversized chest of drawers dressing table and chaise lounge take
up an inordinate amount of space
sound of an alarm clock going off
jim awakens yawns himself into hazy consciousness gropes about on the night table for the clock it isnt there
he slips out of bed and rubbing his eyes blindly moves toward the dresser
the circuitous path which he accomplishes with sleepy dexterity entails going around the chaise lounge just missing the ominously pointed edge of muriels dressing table deftly stepping over the low
dressing table chair and finally reaching the chest of drawers upon which is the clock
he turns off the alarm and yawningly starts back over the same path
we get the feeling that jim makes this sleepy excursion every waking morning of his life
back at his bed jim sits down and yawning loudly gropes with his feet for his slippers
before he can find them however he begins to doze off and slowly tilts back toward the pillow pulling the covers over him
in a moment he is sound asleep
muriels arm automatically stretches out and shakes jim into consciousness
as he painfully reawakens and starts to rise muriels arm disappears
we get the impression that this too is a regular part of the blandings daily routine
jim locates his slippers reaches around for his bathrobe cant find it stumbles his way over to the closet opens the door
this is a fairly good sized closet but it was never intended to be shared by two people particularly not jim and muriel blandings
assuming that they had started out on even terms it is now obviously muriel three to one
her dresses gowns slips seem to obscure his occasional pair of slacks suit or sports coat
her shoes neatly line the floor and the shelf above is loaded to the ceiling with her hat boxes in an orderly but somewhat precarious state of balance
groping blindly for a robe jim feels around and pulls one out
as he slips into the arms we see its much too small for him obviously muriels
in disgust he attempts to put it back
unable to find a hook he finally jams it in between two silk dresses which fall to the floor
as he bends down and gropes for the dresses he discovers his robe crumpled under them on the floor
he drags the robe out and dons it leaving the dresses where they fell
with a guilty look at muriel he closes the closet door and starts out of the bedroom and into the narrow hall
a narrow corridor extending the length of the apartment
off it are doors leading to the bathroom the childrens room and the foyer
jim shuffles down the hall
he stops at the closed bathroom door listens hears the shower knocks
jim continues down the hall stops at the closed door of the childrens room knocks
he opens the door and enters
a small room crowded and cluttered up with the accoutrements of adolescence
joan an eleven year old is asleep in one of the twin beds
jim automatically pulls the covers clear off joans bed
she awakens cocks an eye at him
as she sleepily stretches and prepares to rise jim exits into the hall
camera follows jim through the foyer into the living room on through the very small combination dining and breakfast nook and into the compact but tiny kitchen
gussie the colored cook greets him heartily
a feeble attempt at a smile mm
gussie takes a glass of hot water squeezes in a little lemon stirs and hands it to jim who gulps it down makes a slight face and pats his stomach
gussie hands jim a cup of black coffee and he starts back toward the bedroom
gingerly balancing the cup and saucer jim approaches the door to the childrens room
with split second timing he pauses as the door flies open and joan in her bathrobe towel in hand rushes out and past him down the hall
she disappears into the bathroom
jim carefully proceeds down the hall and as he reaches the bathroom deftly steps to the left as the door bursts open and betsy flies by on the way back
to her bedroom
all this is done with a timing and shifting of hips of which knute rockne might have been proud
jim continues down the hall enters the bedroom
muriel is still asleep as jim enters walks over nudges her
muriel awakens sniffs the fresh coffee smiles sits up takes the cup
thank you dear
they kiss briefly
muriel starts to sip the coffee as jim goes to his chest of drawers
it consists of several rows of small drawers above and large drawers below
jim ruffles through a couple of small drawers pulls out a suit of underwear continues noisily and with some annoyance to look through the other drawers
looking for something dear
briefly my socks
why dont you look in your sock drawer
with restraint thats where i found my underwear
brightly well try your underwear drawer
im in my underwear drawer
he reaches in and holds up one of muriels silk slips
sipping coffee well they must be somewhere
attempt at morning cheeriness socks just dont get up and walk away by themselves
strained patience muriel i thought the top two and a half drawers were to be mine
i wish youd tell gussie the closet
thats where they are
we put them in the closet
in the closet
well there didnt seem to be any room in the drawers
and theres so much of it in the closet
so gussie and i decided that from now on well keep them in a basket on the shelf
well thanks a lot
he strides angrily to the closet opens the door reaches up for the basket and pulls it off the shelf
as he does so all the hat boxes come tumbling down knocking the basket from his hand the socks spilling on the floor
about to explode he looks at muriel
jim i do wish youd make an effort to be a little less clumsy
barely containing himself ill try dear
jim looks at her barely containing himself and then puts the hats back in the boxes jams them back on the shelf where they toter precariously
with bated breath he gingerly closes the closet door
he picks up a pair of socks and walks cautiously toward the hall door
suddenly there is a rumble and crash from inside the closet
jim exchanges a look with muriel is about to say something changes his mind exits into the hall
muriel looks at the closet sighs takes another sip of coffee
jim opens the door of the bathroom
there is a scream
he quickly closes the door scowling with annoyance
a moment later the door opens and joan emerges wrapping her robe around her
sharply father just one morning i wish youd knock
to her back as she walks away morning dear
joan disappears into her room as jim enters the bathroom
very small with a stall shower
jim takes off his bathrobe yawns gets on the scale looks at the dial shakes his head
he takes a deep breath draws in his stomach looks down scowls shrugs gets off moves to the mirror
he examines the thinness of his hair the condition of his tongue etc
taking his toothbrush he looks down at the tube he is about to use frowns
what he sees the toothpaste tube
it has been squeezed in the middle one of blandings pet peeves
close shot jim meticulously smoothes out the tube rolls up the used portion from the bottom
then placing a small amount on his brush he caps the tube and starts vigorously to brush his teeth
as he does so he attempts with his free hand to put the tube back in the medicine cabinet which he opens
close shot the medicine cabinet loaded to the hilt with medical accumulation of fourteen years of family life
close shot jim
as he pushes the tube into the bulging top shelf a bottle of iodine falls out
jim makes a desperate one handed catch still brushing his teeth
as he pushes the iodine into the second shelf a small bottle of pills pops out
jim catches it pushes it back into the cabinet
a bottle of cough medicine falls out
he catches it tries to put it back finds it wont fit
he looks at the bottle sniffs it contemplates its value throws it in the wastebasket
he finishes washing his mouth admires his teeth disrobes and steps into the shower putting on his shower cap
he reacts scowls takes off the cap and turns it upside down a full cup of water falling out
he reaches out for a towel dries the inside of the cap carefully puts it back on his now wet hair
then he turns the water on and at the first warm spray jim blandings life takes a sharp turn for the better
he starts to sing a robust bathroom baritone version of home on the range
jim he stands in front of the washstand lathering his face
over scene we hear muriels voice from the shower
she is singing a lusty chorus of home on the range
jim picks up his razor and turns to the mirror
he reacts with annoyance as he discovers it is covered with steam
with weary resignation he takes a towel and starts to rub off the mirror
as he clears one section another clouds up
by the time he gets it all reasonably clear he finds that his lather needs freshening
he grimly relathers his face only to find that the mirror is again clouded up
as he turns with exasperation toward the shower we see muriel turn off the water reach for a towel start to dry herself
the mirror cleared off jim relathers starts to shave
during this muriel having dried herself and donned her robe comes into scene
reaching for toothbrush excuse
she takes her toothbrush and then opens the cabinet to get the paste
jim automatically following the mirror has to squeeze around in a desperately contorted position as he continues shaving
close shot muriel
she takes the tube from the cabinet and squeezing the tube in the middle applies the paste to her brush
jim and muriel placing the tube on the washstand muriel closes the cabinet
jim still shaving moves back to his original position as he follows the mirror
muriel nods steps back starts to brush her teeth
they both hum home on the range
her mouth full muriel taps jim on the shoulder
without stopping his shaving jim moves to one side as muriel rinses her mouth
she examines her face in the mirror
impatiently if you dont mind dear
as he steps back in front of the mirror muriel continues to look at her face in the glass over his shoulder
she decides she needs a little skin lotion
as she steps in front of him sorry
she again opens the cabinet
jim once more follows the mirror around nicks his face gives up stands glaring arms folded
muriel takes the lotion from the cabinet
take your time
i can spare the blood
looks up oh
i cut myself every morning
i kind of look forward to it
why dont you get an electric razor
trying to shave dont like them
no close shave
bill coles been using one for years
he doesnt have my beard
bills beard is just as tough and coarse and irritably im not interested in discussing the grain and texture of bill coles hair follicles before ive had my orange juice
you dont have to carry on so
i only said why dont you get an electric razor
because i prefer the cool clean sweep of the tempered steel as it glides smoothly stop writing advertising copy
hurry up dear youll be late for breakfast
jim sighs turns back to the mirror and with a few deft strokes finishes shaving
as he reaches for the water faucet he encounters the tube of toothpaste squeezed in the middle
reacting with annoyance he meticulously smoothes it out and rolls it up from the bottom
he opens the cabinet and gingerly places the tube on the top shelf
the iodine bottle pops out
he grimly catches it studies his problem has a solution
with his right hand he starts slowly to close the mirror door
just before it closes he slips the bottle into the cabinet with his left hand quickly slamming the mirror door trapping the bottle
he reacts masterfully at his triumph picks up his robe and starts for the door
as he reaches it there is the sound of the cabinet opening and a crash as the bottle obviously hits the washstand
as jim winces narrow and small
the four blandings are at breakfast jim and muriel each reading his section of the morning paper betsy pasting a clipping in her notebook joan engrossed in a magazine of
as we come in gussie taking off the orange juice is squeezing by jim who accordingly and automatically ducks his head as she passes
jim uncomfortably turns the newspaper to another page folds it reacts with pained but controlled exasperation
who did this
insert newspaper a section of which has been cut out
very matter of factly i did
she holds out her hand to joan who automatically and without looking up hands her the salt
i have repeatedly told you ducking as gussie comes back with coffee dont cut up the morning paper until ive had a chance to look at it
im sorry father
its necessary research
she hands the salt back to joan who automatically passes it to muriel
with some sarcasm i suppose this is another of miss stellwagons so called progressive projects
using salt and handing it to jim now dear there just isnt any point in sending your children to an expensive school if youre going to undermine the teachers authority
in your own dining room
im not undermining anything
i happen to be in the advertising business and keeping abreast of the times is important to me
and so is your childrens education
thats not the point
it certainly is
it certainly is not
without looking up from her magazine bicker bicker bicker
you eat your cornflakes
jim ducks as gussie passes back on her way to the kitchen
handing joan toast joan every time your father and i have a lively discussion we arent necessarily bickering
to betsy solicitously what is it dear another english composition
taking toast from joan miss stellwagon has assigned each of us to take a want ad and write a human interest theme about it
to jim passing toast to him i found one typical of the disintegration of our present society
taking toast not looking up from his paper i wasnt aware of the fact that our society was disintegrating
i didnt expect you to be father
miss stellwagon says that middle class people like us are all too prone to overlook the pressures and tensions which befall the less fortunate members of our community
jim puts down the paper turns to muriel
with great restraint muriel i know its asking a lot but just one morning i would like to sit down and have breakfast without social significance
picks up his paper
jim you really might take a little more interest in your childrens education
without looking up you cant squeeze blood from a turnip
jim reacts with painful resignation folds his arms puts down the paper turns slowly to betsy
picking up her scrapbook its just twenty four words
but in simple eloquence it mirrors a minor tragedy of our times
reading forced to sell
farm dwelling oak grove apple orchard trout stream hay fields four barns seclusion superb view original beams paved highway acreage
with emotion will sacrifice
simply thats all
you dont see it do you father
fellow wants to sell a house so he puts an ad in the paper
what did you expect him to do take it to the united nations
there must be more to it than that
to betsy isnt there dear
what some people dont see is the whole sordid picture
a poor honest farmer pushed to the wall by hardship soil erosion mortgages everybody gobbling gobbling gobbling until finally in desperation he is forced to sell and stoops to the
crass commercialism of newspaper advertising
muttering oh indeed
nose in her magazine miss stellwagon says advertising is a basically parasitic profession
with extreme control oh she does
miss stellwagon says that advertising makes people who cant afford it buy things they dont want with money they havent got
elaborate sarcasm perhaps your miss stellwagon is right
perhaps i ought to get out of this basically parasitic profession which at the moment is paying for her very fancy tuition those extra french lessons her progressive summer camp
and for that matter the very braces on your teeth
i wish you wouldnt discuss money in front of the children
why not they spend enough of it
bicker bicker bicker
as jim gives her a look and buries himself in his paper the downstairs buzzer rings
gussie enters squeezes by jim who automatically ducks goes to the phone in b
calls miss blandings theres a mr
funkhauser wants to see you
remembers oh mr
thats what he says
muriel looks nervously at jim who is preoccupied reading his paper
then she turns back to gussie
uh better ask him to come up
into phone says to come up
gussie hangs up squeezes by jim exits into the kitchen
tentatively oh uh darling mr
looking up who
you remember bunny funkhauser that clever young interior decorator we met at the collins cocktail party
distastefully whats he doing here
nervously well i imagine hes brought the uh estimates
rapidly to conceal a feeling of guilt darling you know how long weve said weve got to do something about this apartment and well he called last week and i
had him come over and hes got some simply wonderful ideas
quietly there couldnt be two bunny funkhausers could there
why no dear
then this is the same clever young man whos responsible for that zebra striped monstrosity in the collins living room
that couch is terribly functional
phil collins told me what he paid for all that function
angrily if you think im going to sound of doorbell ringing
changing subject children youll be late to school
run along and the children rise pick up their school paraphernalia
miss stellwagon says that functionalism in modern furniture never mind dear
she hustles betsy and joan toward the foyer as jim rises
gussie has just admitted mr
he is a tall slender effete looking young man
he is loaded down with sketches samples of wallpaper bolts of material
betsy and joan brush by him on their way out
with a sharp appraising look hi
as they rush out and the door closes jim and muriel enter scene
good morning mr
you remember mr
but of course
he sweeps by them into the living room taking over completely
youll have to pardon my bursting in at this dreary hour puts a sketch on a chair practically the middle of the night puts wallpaper against mantel but i did
so want to catch you in
ive been at it hammer and tongs all week and im just a mess drapes bolt of chintz over high backed chair but then muriel and i thought we ought
to talk it over with you before we take the plunge
funkhauser looks briefly for a high object over which to display his last bolt of chintz finds none settles for jims shoulder over which he drapes the cloth the folds
flowing down in front
as jim reacts smoothing out folds on the chintz after all its your home too and it should reflect you
you know mans castle all that sort of thing
jim looks down at the chintz
quickly jim just wait till you hear
hes got some wonderful ideas for the foyer
oh thats out
changed the whole thing
i just couldnt live with it
i said to myself bunny what are the blandings
how shall we do them
and the answer was perfectly obvious
very american very grass roots very blueberry pie that sort of thing
dark look at muriel mm
funkhauser fingers the material of a drape disdainfully removes his hand
now first lets dig into this living room of yours its really a dreary
quickly to jim we want this room to be very gay dear
something in bright reds yellows and greens
appalled red yellow and green
oh come mr
blandings lets not run away from color
not running away a lame joke just backing off a little
brightly now as i see our room its definitely colonial
you know cobblers bench breakfront pie cooler student lamp hooked rug
but everything in good taste
it must not jump out at you and scream look see how antique i am
of course these things take imagination
youve simply got to be able to visualize
politely removing chintz if youll forgive me mr
funkhauser what id like to visualize at this dreary hour is how much is this all going to cost
well really i hesitate to say
after all indicates by the time this wall is out we may find reacting this wall is what
source of light is from the east
obviously if our room is to have any function at all youre going to tear out the wall
dear its a wonderful notion
visualize three feet of leaded panes the rest can you give me a figure
costs arent what they used to be you know and just a figure
materials are impossible labor has just run wild just an overall figure
i shouldnt like to be tied down
but i suppose if you must have a figure id say mm lightly somewhere in the neighborhood of seven
that would be seven
jim looks at muriel considers
soberly we ll
that seems fair
gathering up materials after all were not running away from color picks up wallpaper and we are tearing out walls picks up sketches mr
funkhauser do you have a card
jim we havent even discussed the rest of the house
we will dear
leads the whole batch on funkhauser huffy well really i deftly steering him toward the door well talk it all out and then well get in touch with bunny
camera trucks with them to the door
well really i mean i was under the impression wed come to some decision today
im sure we will
so nice of you to come
puts funkhausers hat on his head good day
and funkhauser is gone
jim closes the door turns ominously
apprehensively now darling you you just dont go to a man like funkhauser and ask how much its going to cost before you even know what hes going to do
no that would be too logical
seven thousand dollars
i wouldnt put seventy five cents into this broken down rat trap
sentimentally its our home jim
betsy was practically born in this apartment
that does not make it a national shrine
vehemently seven thousand dollars and not one word about closets
you wouldnt even let him get to the bathroom
i havent got that kind of money
the way you talk jim blandings youd think i was some kind of congenital idiot
sometimes im beginning to wonder
furious you can just get out of here
thats not a bad idea
he angrily jerks open the hall closet door pulls his hat down from the shelf several hat boxes some ski boots and a tennis racket tumbling down on his head
jim jams his hat onto his head takes a deep breath and storms out slamming the door
muriel walks over to the closet is about to bend down and pick up a hatbox when all of her pent up emotions explode
she kicks the hat box into the closet slams the door starts to cry
exiting from the elevator jim enters a door marked on the wall are various framed copies of jims handiwork
most prominent are advertisements for a meat product called wham
a whale of a ham
there is ample evidence of the fact that jims most successful slogan is when youve got the whim say wham
jim enters goes to his desk sits down still emotionally upset
he glances at a photograph of muriel looks guiltily away then back
to photograph sorry
his secretary enters
good morning mr
you wanted to see the color copy from this months house and stream
she hands him a magazine
he looks at it perfunctorily is about to hand it back when his eye is caught by an ad on the back cover
insert the back cover a community and extolling life in the country sponsored by a group of realtors local chamber of commerce etc
over a pastoral scene of lovely little houses checkering a rolling landscape are the words in smaller type over this will that be all
looking up blankly hm
will that be all
without answering he turns back to the ad
the camera comes in for a head closeup as he studies the ad and on the sound track we hear forced to sell
farm dwelling oak grove apple orchard trout stream hay fields four barns original beams as he looks up thoughtfully it is a convertible the top down
jim is driving through manhattan
well thats the way it all started
the ad was enough to convince jim jim and muriel they are leaving manhattan entering the merritt parkway
muriel wearing an orchid corsage looks curiously at jim
his answering gesture says just wait and see
over this but muriel was a little tougher
i guess the corsage did it
jim muriel and mr
smith they are driving through a beautiful connecticut countryside
smith a local real estate dealer is of that shrewd yankee breed which specializes in the understatement underselling school of salesmanship
there they are two little fish from new york out in the deep deep waters of connecticut real estate
thats smith the real estate salesman
mighty shrewd cookie in a quiet sort of way
never thought hed get a bite this quick
smith looks speculatively at the blandings
now hes sizing up the catch
convertible orchids must be pretty well fixed
wonder if theyre lookers or buyers
jim takes a deep breath looks at muriel as if to say get that air
muriel smiles with approval
jim pats her hand affectionately
confidentially yes sir smith looks like youre finally going to unload the old hackett place
now first thing is get em a little anxious
jim slows down the car as they approach a rather picturesque looking old connecticut farmhouse
he and muriel react with approval look questioningly at smith
smith shakes his head no as though to say not nearly good enough for you
th a a ts right
jim muriel mr
smith they pass another house
jim and muriel appraise it with interest look at smith
uh uh not yet
smith firmly shakes his head no
jim muriel and mr
smith another house
take it easy smith give em a little more line
smith shakes his head no
jim muriel and mr
smith the car pulls to a stop
now were ready to gaff em
proudly well folks there she is the old hackett place
the blandings look off react with interest and approval
what they see burrowed into the upward slope of the land is the old hackett farmhouse
if the roof seems to sway a little and the massive stone chimney to tilt a bit and the overall condition of board and beam to be a trifle unsteady
charge it up to age which will be a hundred and seventy years come next april
however the overall effect is definitely one of picturesque rustic beauty
in the back are a series of barns and behind them the rolling hills known as bald mountain
fifty mighty pretty little acres
involuntarily its simply charming
jims look cautions against her over enthusiasm
that is for an old house
casually of course you understand mr
smith were just window shopping so to speak
nothing really definite in mind
perfectly all right
studies house with assumed indifference mm
not a bad looking place but its certainly a lot older than anything we had in mind
shes no spring chicken sagely but thats just what makes her such a buy
they look at him curiously
smiths attitude is matter of fact almost without enthusiasm
this isnt just old timber or a virgin stand oak grove other side of the trout stream or a couple of fruit orchards
youre buying a piece of american history
interested in spite of himself you dont say
first year she was built general gates stopped right here to water his horses
old general gates civil war
oh that general gates
hear that honey general gates
with concern wouldnt that make the house over a hundred years old
proudly hundred and seventy come next april
the blandings exchange a doubtful look which smith catches
now im not trying to sell you anything all im saying is that one of these days someone with a little vision and imaginations goin to come along and just
steal this place confidentially and i mean steal it
the blandings as one turn to the house with renewed interest
this is not lost on smith
blandings i know you can look at that house and just about picture what a couple of coats of paint and a little pointing up here and there can do
the camera moves to a head closeup of jim as he begins to visualize what he sees the old hackett place suddenly dissolves into the new blandings place jims version
it is a lovely country house
jim in jodhpurs tweed coat pipe and accompanied by two large irish setters is proudly surveying his property
he nonchalantly holds a sleek beautiful shotgun in the most precisely correct position
close shot jims face
his lips dont move but we hear his voice
wonder what he meant by steal
and i guess i dont have to tell you mrs
blandings what a womans touch could do to a place like this
well camera moves to a head closeup of muriel as she starts to visualize
what she sees the old hackett place dissolves into a dainty feminine cottage with criss cross curtains at the window and a lovely little white rail fence enclosing her garden
muriel in delightful gingham is in the garden admiring her latest triumph the largest rose ever grown in lansdale county
close shot muriels face
her face is soft
her lips dont move but we hear it is a nice old house
it just needs someone to love it thats all
yes sir youve certainly got to visualize
camera moves to a head closeup of smith as he too begins to visualize
what he sees the old hackett place
suddenly superimposed over it in large figures is
group shot smith looks at him and muriel who are looking at the house with unabashed affection
jims arm goes tenderly around muriels waist
smith looks back at the house
what he sees the old hackett place
is quickly replaced by
brightly shall we go up and take a look at her
a little too casual well i suppose as long as were here
same i guess it doesnt hurt to take a look
as smith precedes them up the path toward the house sotto it does have possibilities
do you think we can get it
sotto like taking candy from a baby
same now dont lose your head
just keep quiet and let me handle this
as they enter the house tell me smith what kind of a price is the owner asking for this old place
jim and muriel precede smith as they exit from the house
as jim and muriel carry on a sotto voce conversation smith looks off with some concern in the direction of the road
its wonderful jim
that master bedroom with those two closets
funkhauser could do wonders with this firmly funkhauser will have nothing to do with this house
smiths face suddenly brightens as a weatherbeaten old car appears turns up the driveway stops
calling hi george
to the blandings feigned surprise what do you know its eph hackett owner of the place
pleased well you dont say
eph hackett gets out of the car saunters over
hackett is a middle aged rural looking taciturn new englander eph this is mr
blandings from new york city
how do you do
you certainly have a lovely place here mr
briefly ye ap
hackett weve just been talking to smith here about uh taking the old place off your hands
hackett exchanges the briefest of looks with smith who almost imperceptibly shakes his head no
firmly aint for sale
as the blandings react with dismay smoothly why dont you folks just go out in back and take a look at the orchard
he gives them a wink which says just leave it to me
the blandings exchange a look turn and walk off
howm i doin george
nice timin eph
think we got something here
they the same people you showed it to in nineteen thirty eight
they were lookers this is the real thing
if they got five thousand dollars on em
dont let em get away
they already offered ten
mildly ydont say
whats my asking price
a mite stiff
ive got em measured
mellower theyre gonna take the place for turns looks back at house eleven thousand
make it eleven thousand five hundred fifty
odd kind of figure
might as well take the commission out of them instead of me
as smith raises a knowing eyebrow muriel and the two children are having breakfast
jim enters in high spirits
during this scene we repeat the business of passing etc
used in the previous breakfast scene
singing gaily to home on the range home home in connecticut with a closet to hang up your petticut
as he seats himself jim
going on as he places his napkin in his lap no hustle or fuss no fifth avenue bus uh jim
i was just wondering dear
ten thousand dollars is such an awful lot to offer jim looks suspiciously at her at the children then back at her
that is for two people who dont know anything at all about real estate or anything
jims look darkens i mean dont you think perhaps we should have asked someones professional advice
well bill knows about these things and muriel for once in my life im going to make one small decision on my own without the legalistic machinations of mr
it seems very peculiar that when your very best friend happens to be one of the very cleverest young lawyers in new york city muriel i dont want to hear
another word about bill cole
turns to children well did your mother tell you about the house
miss stellwagon says the current craze for modernizing old farmhouses is a form of totem worship
with great restraint did it ever occur to you two that there may be some remote intangible subjects upon which your miss irma stellwagon is not the final authority
why dont we buy a solaxion house
you know its just barely conceivable what kind of a house
its built on a mast like a tent and it revolves with the sun
with the sun
who lives next door buck rogers
its the only practical way to live
when a new model comes out you trade the old one in like a used car
plaintively muriel children you havent even seen this house yet
personally id like a crane mobile home
it comes all folded up and all you do is plug it in for electricity and water and now just a minute
to muriel what kind of children are these
to girls do you want to spend the rest of your lives in chromium tents and portable merry go rounds
this house was built before our country became a nation
it has dignity
its its gussie enters with a letter
handing it to jim special delivery mr
with suppressed excitement from smith
as he eagerly opens it and reads his face falls
reading i have conveyed your offer of ten thousand dollars to mr
hackett and am sorry to say he is not interested
however i feel
maybe we should have gone a few dollars higher
stoutly hes bluffing
simple as that
for ten thousand dollars we could get a rockford trailer and a zamboni power unit
its kitchen bathroom and air conditioning all rolled up into jim gives her a weary look turns to muriel
firmly muriel ill let him push me to ten thousand two hundred but not a penny more
insert jims cost chart rising diagonally and bisecting the chart is a line graduated in scale starting at and running up to around
resting on the line at exactly is a miniature of the old house
fluttering across the scene from left to right is a letter from smith on the stationery of the lansdale realty co
as we see the letter and hear the voice of smith miniature figures of smith and hackett appear at the lower side of the house
their shoulders start pushing the house up the graduated scale
over this dear mr
blandings while your offer of ten thousand two hundred is still not acceptable to ephemus hackett a letter on danton bascombs stationery flutters across the screen from right to left
a miniature figure of jim appears above the house desperately pushing it back
over this we hear dear mr
smith you may inform mr
hackett that the very highest i could possibly go as a succession of letters flutter across the screen first from left to right and then from right to left and
the house is jockeyed back and forth they are punctuated with the following lines dear friend blandings my dear friend smith dear blandings
throughout this smiths voice remains bland and unperturbed while jims has the desperate frenetic quality of a man being slowly pushed to the wall
the special effect concludes with the house finally and firmly at rest on the preordained
as the antagonists on both sides of the house relax smith reaches around in front of the house and shakes hands with jim
its a deal
about halfway through when the going gets tough jim beckons muriel to help in the losing fight
as they now embrace smith and hackett shake hands in mutual congratulation
door on it is printed a successful lawyers office the walls crowded with leather bound books
jim and muriel are seated facing the large desk behind which sits bill cole
bill finishes reading a series of papers the sum total of correspondence between jim and mr
he sets down the papers leans back thoughtfully
jim and muriel look at him with nervous but eager anticipation
not too sure what do you think bill
drily it certainly is
jim looks triumphantly at muriel
perhaps steal is an understatement swindle might be a little more appropriate
with pride well it wasnt much bill
i just saw a good thing and i take what do you mean
every time you get a little tight you weep on my shoulder about the advertising business and how it forces a sensitive soul like yourself to make a living by
bamboozling the american public
picks up smiths correspondence i would say that a small part of this victimized group has now redressed the balance
what are you talking about
youve been taken to the cleaners and you dont even know your pants are off
dear i told you
i said we should call bill never mind muriel
to bill challengingly all right just whats wrong with this deal
first time around you offered ten thousand dollars for fifty acres right
what of it
thats two hundred dollars an acre
i know that part of connecticut and one hundred dollars an acre is standard top gouge price to city slickers
when the natives sell to each other its around forty or less
forty dollars an acre
the mans entitled to a fair profit
not two hundred and eighty four percent
indicates papers and besides youre not getting fifty acres youre only getting thirty five more or less
where does it say that
picks up letter i refer to a rather obscure post script on the back of the second letter from friend smith
he hands the letter to muriel
reading incidentally mr
hackett has been a little over optimistic about the acreage
it will probably survey somewhere in the neighborhood of thirty five acres more or less but i feel sure
on the defensive all right so its thirty five
whats the difference
do you know how many tennis courts you can get on thirty five acres
youre not spending eleven thousand five hundred dollars for tennis courts
thats not the point
very businesslike thats precisely the point
were going to write this hackett a strong letter and tell him he can either kick in with those fifteen acres reduce the price or find another sucker
rising emotion well do no such thing
im not going to queer this deal over fifteen broken down acres
to bill we were just going window shopping and so far its cost us eleven thousand five hundred dollars and they even made us pay the commission
you dont understand business
you mean extortion
as jim turns on bill and is about to answer him explosively thoughtfully i wonder if we could get another two year lease on the apartment
heatedly now wait a minute
you cant measure everything on a slide rule
this house has certain intangibles
like what for instance
like antique value for instance
it just so happens that general gates stopped right there at that very house to water his horses
i dont care if general grant dropped in for a scotch and soda youre still getting rocked
that was a different war
i think bills absolutely right
struggling to contain himself quietly let me explain something
to both of you
for fifteen years ive been cooped up in a four room cracker box
just getting shaved in the morning entitles a man to the congressional medal for bravery
that doesnt make this a good buy
bill muriel and i have found what i am not ashamed to call our dream house
its like a fine painting
you buy it with your heart not your head
you dont ask how much was the canvas how much was the paint
you look at it and you say its beautiful
i want it and if it costs a few pennies more you pay it and gladly because you love it and you cant measure the things you love in dollars
muriel looks at jim impressed her face softening with compassion
emotionally spent well thats how i feel about this place
and when i sign those papers saturday i can look the world in the face and say its mine
my thirty five acres
coming over moved touched our house
our thirty five acres
they tenderly kiss
more or less
on jims reaction comprehensive shot showing village green of a small typical quaint new england town
old judge quarles is reading from the title deed the proceedings almost over
jim stands in front of the bench flanked by muriel and bill
smith and hackett are the only other people present
as the judge drones on jim and muriel exchange a smile
jim squeezes her hand intimately
thence along said stonewall fence forming the east boundary of said lansdale road n e
feet to the end of said stonewall fence thence along a wire fence n w
feet to a dead twenty inch chestnut tree thence westward to said stonewall fence to a total of thirty one and a half acres reacting what was that
how many acres
judge quarles looks up impatiently at the interruption
precisely thirty one and a half
to hackett i was under the impression your property was thirty five acres mr
more or less
bill looks significantly at jim
you see mr
blandings when you signed the purchase agreement it was subject to traced map attached
surveyed to an even thirty one and a half acres
jim turns to bill for affirmation
bill soberly nods his head yes
its nothing your honor just a few less tennis courts
jim gives bill a sour look as the judge continues with ministerial resonance
to have and to hold to him the said grantee his heirs and assigns to his and their own proper use and benefit forever
during this and as a shaft of sunlight hits them a beatific look comes across the faces of jim and muriel
for a moment it has become their wedding day
after a momentary pause very businesslike subject to a six thousand dollar mortgage held by ephemus whittaker hackett
as the blandings are startled back to grim reality long shot the blandings car
the blandings and bill cole driving along
they approach a fork in the road which leads to a very old covered new england bridge
on the bridge is a sign which reads mi
they pause turn go through the bridge
as they drive through the dark interior of the bridge there is an appropriate rattling and rumbling of the ancient timbers
there is another fork in the road
muriel points to the road to the right
jim shakes his head points to the road to the left
muriel points to the right
jim emphatically shakes his head puts the car in gear drives off on the road to the left
long shot the car
it goes up to the top of a hill stops starts up disappears
as the car approaches the camera discloses it is back at the same covered bridge
the car stops
jim reacts with annoyance mops his brow
drily congress ought to pass a law
when a man buys a house in lansdale county theres a prize he gets ten percent off if he can find it
jim backs up and over muriels protestation that they go right turns the car left
long shot the car
it drives up an empty road disappears
as the car approaches the camera reveals it is again back at the old covered bridge
the sign still reads shrunk mills mi
jim and muriel look at each other with disgust and resignation
what in the world are shrunk mills
they are probably mills that have shrunk
well you certainly arent much of a help
wearily look you really want to find that house of yours its no problem
they look at him curiously
just pretend youre one of general gates horses and youre thirsty
now where would you go for a drink of water
jim looks at him darkly drives through the bridge turns right as muriel looks slightly triumphant
jim muriel and bill stand a little distance from the house looking at it
a vast lilac spreads across it
the blandings are in quiet rapture and it is bill who speaks first
frank and open well i must admit its a very beautiful thing
misty the house and the lilac are just the same age bill if the lilac can live and be so old so can the house
it just needs someone to love it thats all
three shingles slide from the roof
as jim and muriel react its a good thing there are two of you one to love it and one to hold it up
as jim gives him a look whatd your engineer say when he checked over the foundation and that roof
who needs engineers
this isnt a train you know
i just saw it move
this house has been standing since the second year of the continental congress
you take one look at it and shingles start to fall off
as if on cue a few more shingles slide off the roof nearly hitting jim
solicitously look let me do you a favor
ive got a client crackerjack structural engineer joe apollonio he practically built the george washington bridge single handed
thanks a lot but were not building a bridge
hes the follow who advised the government not to raise the normandie they didnt listen to him cost them five million dollars
you have my word if i were raising the normandie i wouldnt make a move without apollonio
indicates door now would you like to come inside and look around
a skeptical look at the roof no thanks ill just stay out in the car and listen to life can be beautiful
as jim opens the door and disappears there is a crash followed by a series of other crashes
muriel looks in turns back to bill
i think youd better contact mr
near the front entrance
after a moment the door opens and the blandings and mr
jim limping is aided and abetted by a cane
apollonio is a stolid new york construction man replete with derby blue serge suit and cigar
a short rule sticks out of a back pocket
as they emerge the blandings are hopefully enthusiastic apollonio is thoughtfully noncommittal
it has charm hasnt it mr
through his cigar uh huh
of course any small changes would have to conform with the character of the countryside
through his cigar mm hmm
and yet still be functional
apollonio casually walks over to the corner of the house kicks an exposed beam
it crumbles apparently rotted by termites
two shingles fall off
the blandings watch him anxiously
gazing upward oblivious uh huh
as he thoughtfully rubs his chin jim followed by muriel limps his way over to him
well uh whats your professional opinion
apollonio looks at the blandings at the house then back at the blandings
he takes the cigar from his mouth
tear it down
appalled tear it down
if your chimney was shot and your sills was okay id say go ahead fix her up
if your sills was shot and your chimney was okay again id say go ahead fix her up
but your sills are shot and your chimney is shot
during this speech apollonio picks up a wooden frame squares it with a pocket square levels it on a fence and looks through it at the house
beckoning take a look at the way she sags
the blandings step over look through the frame
what they see
outlined against the frame the house slants sagging perceptibly
three shot as the blandings react with some dismay
so i say dont throw good money after bad tear it down
coolly thanks a lot
he tips his hat walks out of scene
bitterly bill cole and his experts
bitterly darling well get our own experts
the blandings have just finished surveying the house with mr
simpson another expert
and so they got their own experts
simpson said tear it down
the blandings look at each other
the blandings have just finished examining the house with mr
murphy another expert
on the other hand mr
murphy said i think youd better tear it down
the blandings smile feebly
the blandings and jones another expert
and then just to be a wee bit different mr
jones said firmly deep bass voiced tear it down
the blandings are now considerably shaken
it reads in neat conservative lettering and thats how our friend mr
simms came into it
jim muriel simms
the room is in quiet good taste a flagstone fireplace modern steel casement windows window seats etc
the walls are crammed with books and photographs of simms handiwork
there are a couple of gold medal citations of his work conspicuously spaced around the room
simms is a tweedy pipe smoking conservative new englander a distinguished looking local architect
he puffs thoughtfully on his pipe as he looks at a photograph of the old hackett place an exact duplicate of the shot we saw through the window frame
of course you could fix up that old house
you can fix up any structure thats still standing
the sills and floors couldnt be worse i grant you and i guess youd have to jack up that west corner at least three feet to make it level
need new chimney
complete new plumbing
sigh too bad you didnt buy it ten years ago
could have fixed it up in jig time then and it would have made some sense
nervously nibbling at his nails uh huh
fact is before youre through it would be less expensive to tear the old place down and build a new one same size
as the notion sinks in becomes attractive new house
to simms with pleasant incredulity you mean
for the same money
we could build a brand new house
it certainly wouldnt cost any more
he turns and looks thoughtfully at muriel who raises an interested eyebrow
then to simms tentatively just
what sort of thing do you have in mind
well i imagine the type of house youd want would be something in quiet good taste two story frame and brick veneer construction modern but of course fitting in with
the architectural traditions of the countryside
well i what do you think muriel
i think it sounds fine
perhaps youd like to see a basic floor plan reaches into file behind him something like this
simms places the basic floor plan on the desk before him the blandings moving around flanking him
they examine the plan with interest
what they see the plan
a simple master plan of a two story house the names of the various rooms indicated
as he talks we see simms hand holding a pencil point out the various rooms first floor
living room study dining room kitchen service porch maids room upstairs three family bedrooms with two adjoining baths
the blandings praise the plan with the uncompromising expertness of two people who have never seen such a plan before in their lives
its very nice im sure but uh well doesnt it seem just a little bit conventional
yes simms if we were going to build a house we want it well you know just a little bit different
hes heard all this before yes of course
now for instance takes simms pencil the drawing board
jims pencil traces as he talks
here in the study if we could just push out this wall a little and put in a built in bar we could excuse me dear her hand takes the
pencil from his starts to trace as she talks
jims fingers drum with the beginnings of impatience
they do seem rather small
and of course wed have to have a little dressing room and as she draws it in jims hand takes the pencil
muriels fingers drum nervously
and closets simms lots of closets
traces them in if theres one thing this family needs its closets
as his hand reaches for the pencil if i might make a suggestion but muriels hand reaches the pencil first
as she draws them in and bathrooms mr
each bedroom must have at least one bathroom
but that would be four bathrooms mrs
blandings his hand reaches for the pencil i think id better point out to you jims hand reaches the pencil before simms
now simms fingers and muriels drum in unison
just a minute
do you think tracing we might manage a little playroom in the basement nothing tremendous you know something like this as his hand reaches for the pencil cautiously well its
always possible but at the moment our fundamental problem but muriels hand has the pencil
as she traces and ive always wanted a little sewing room upstairs jims and simms fingers drum impatiently you know a little utility room where i can be alone and
sew or sulk or on a rainy afternoon
as his hand takes pencil pardon me dear
on that playroom simms not too small
you know plenty of room for ping pong darts nice big poker table
as his hand reaches for another pencil if you dont mind i but muriel has reached the pencil first
as she and jim sketch simultaneously and the scene begins to dissolve we hear and off the kitchen id like a little flower sink just to putter around in
and a terrace off the study with an owning and little outdoor fireplace
the drawing board the original plans are lost in a maze of the blandings extensions alterations and additions
three shot the three are somewhat exhausted silently looking at the plans
simms wearily runs his hand through his hair
delicately we ll
lets just see what we have here
in the first place the drawing board simms pencil indicates as he talks
im afraid youve got the upstairs about twice as big as the downstairs
its all those bathrooms
it is not its all those closets
by extending this breakfast room youve eliminated the possibility of any stairs going to the second floor
oh you can just shove those stairs in anywhere
patiently almost paternally and mrs
blandings on that sewing room the way you have it now the chimney stack would come up right through the middle of the room leaving you with something in the
shape of a square doughnut
tactfully which of course might be very warm in winter but otherwise of doubtful utility
you could always move the chimney somewhere else couldnt you
rising resigned to his fate but tactful look i think i know just about what you two have in mind
why dont i go ahead with some preliminary plans and hearty you do that simms but remember weve got to hold it down to ten thousand
candid that i can tell you right now is impossible
even with a considerable trimming of the things youve indicated i dont see how we can bring it in for less than twelve or twelve five
looks at muriel then well i guess were not going to quibble about a few pennies one way or the other
cant resist no youll find mr
blandings never quibbles about pennies
and uh have you any notions about how youd like the old place taken down
a rueful joke why dont we just blow on it
wry smile theres a good local house wrecker
ill have him contact you
jim expansively puts his arm around simms shoulders
you just shoot ahead with those plans and remember try to keep it down to ten ten five
doubtfully well well try
as the blandings walk to the door theres one good thing about getting that old relic down
those original beams and everything this time somebody pays us
as they go out the door old hackett house matted to show winter sky bare trees
in the f
bare ground with patches of snow
eph hackett is standing with one of the wreckers
in the b
we see the frame of the old house firmly intact the chimney still standing within it
there are mountains of shingles splintered boards and other rubbish piled about
the piles are reasonably neat and sorted
them beams is worth money
you payin him or he payin you
hes payin me
hesitating a thousand
he squawked but he paid
i guess maybe i got a little somethin comin too
as he starts out of scene okay boys let her go
tractors attached to chains and cables start to pull
miniature shot what is left of the house collapses
jim and muriel are standing there having watched the demolition
as the dust settles sigh well so far its cost us thirteen thousand three hundred and twenty nine dollars and forty five cents
but weve got the nicest vacant lot in the state of connecticut
they exchange a look of mixed emotions
insert simms new preliminary plans fresh and workmanlike a few small sections crossed out where cuts have been indicated
wearily something will have to give somewhere that i know
the camera angle widens to disclose jim muriel and simms are going over the preliminary plans
betsy and joan are present betsy reading the lansdale blade and joan reading a science book
i dont see how we can cut another inch
honey you heard simms
as the house stands now its over fifteen thousand dollars
well it just doesnt seem possible afterthought for a house with such small rooms
blandings ive already explained
its not only the size of the rooms so much as it is the number
you see our primary problem is one of cubage thats right dear cubage
oh sorry he got into it just a figure of speech
but what does it mean
a little irritably cubage
its just the number of cubic feet that lost lamely go into a cubic foot
go on simms
consulting plans now is it absolutely essential for each of your daughters to have her own room with two closets and a separate bath
a look at the girls clearing his throat yes
you see er my daughters are er approaching womanhood and er brief look at the girls i hadnt realized they were approaching it quite so fast
to jim perhaps what you need is not so much a house as a series of little bungalows
examining plans what about that silly flower sink
we could eliminate that
i beg your pardon
or that sewing room upstairs thats certainly a waste
if were going to eliminate anything well lose that ridiculous play room in the basement with that great big poker table
honey ive got to have some relaxation
weve got thirty one and a half acres
go out in the back and do a little gardening
sure and get poison ivy
with dogged patience if i may interrupt id like to suggest that none of these are really major eliminations
now if we could do with one less bathroom on the second floor im sorry
we couldnt possibly
blandings a simple bathroom eight by ten by eight with grade a fixtures will cost around thirteen hundred dollars
i refuse to endanger the health of my children in a house with less than four bathrooms
for thirteen hundred dollars they can live in a house with three bathrooms and rough it
look perhaps the most practical thing would be oh look were in the lansdale paper
reading historical society blasts vandalism
muriel simms explained to you
weve just got to cut cut reacts whats that
reading censure vote passed re destruction of famed hackett edifice
well isnt that just too bad
let me see that
he takes the paper scans it suddenly bursts into laughter
whats so funny
get a load of this
reads the semi monthly meeting of the lansdale historical society was turned into an uproar last night when its president mrs
bildad prutty how do you like that bildad prutty
reported the total demolition by its new york buyer of the historic old hackett house
laughs bildad prutty
muriel ive got to send this to the new yorker
drily read on father
scans paper mrs
prutty bildad that is reminded her audience that several years ago the society started to raise a fund to purchase and restore the old house to its original condition
looks up laughs scornfully read on father
back to paper the project fell through by being seven hundred dollars short of the sum of twenty six hundred dollars
jim slows down as the following registers
which ephemus hackett testified was the lowest reasonable price he could accept as the paper drops
weakly twenty six hundred dollars
and what did we pay father
eleven five with the commission
muriel isnt it time for those children to be in bed
now girls i dont want to tell you again
the front doorbell rings
as the camera follows muriel to the door we hear twenty six hundred dollars
comfortingly i wouldnt be too concerned about mrs
prutty and her committee
after all its your property and if you want to tear it down muriel opens the door admits an excited bill cole
surprised why bill
briefly hello muriel
he strides past her waving a telegram to jim well youve done it again
once just once why dont you come to me and find out if its all right if its legal before you go barging off and run yourself smack into another
whats eating you
ignoring him to simms and i must say simms i hold you equally responsible
im afraid i dont understand
to simms indicating jim did you let this idiot tear down that house
what if he did
what of it
to bill reconstruction was unsound and totally impractical
i quite agree
but youre dealing with a man who doesnt think before he acts who goes off half cocked
what is it
what did i do
ignoring him to simms youre an architect
you must have been aware of the legality involved
to simms you knew there was a mortgage on that house
i assumed as much
what are you talking about
ignoring him to simms and you know the requirements in regard to a mortgage where theres demolition intended
but since you were his lawyer i naturally assumed with a man like this you cant assume anything
loudly just one minute
i am entitled to know what i did
this is america
a mans guilty until hes proven innocent its the other way around father
you go to bed
bill ive had a very trying day
would you mind telling me in clear concise english just what crime ive committed and why
with weary resignation in clear concise english you tore down a house on which another man holds a mortgage without first getting his written permission
well i i did
and in such case the mortgagee can demand the full payment of said mortgage upon demand waves telegram and mr
ephemus hackett so demands
six thousand clams
and he wants them now
youve got ten days
for six thousand dollars we could have had a solaxion house and a crane mobile home
herding the kids toward the door girls say your good nights and off to bed without another word
reluctantly good night mr
protesting miss stellwagon says the problems of the parents should be the problems of the children
shooing them out you keep that in mind dear
itll help prepare you for motherhood
the children exit
an embarrassed pause
perhaps wed better let the plans go for the time being and weakly no simms ill work this out
you go ahead with your final plans and lets see some estimates
and well just forget about that extra bathroom
preparing to leave very well
youll hear from me as soon as possible
good nights are exchanged
muriel takes simms out of scene toward the door
camera holds on bill and jim
defeated six thousand dollars
bill looks at jim with compassion
whatll you do for collateral on your building loan
i dont know turn in my insurance policies or something
coming into scene now jim you cant do that
what if something should happen
you cant leave the children unprotected
somewhat irritably im not dead yet
and if i die theres plenty left to take care of them
not if you cash in your policies
as jim reacts with painful resignation im sure it wont be necessary
ill see the boys at the bank
maybe you can put up your insurance as collateral
if necessary ill sign a personal note
wearily thanks bill
paternally and jim do me a little favor
the next time youre going to do anything or say anything or buy anything think it over very carefully and when youre sure youre right forget the whole thing
good night muriel
he goes to muriel and kisses her on the cheek
jim sees it is annoyed
good night bill
camera follows muriel and bill to the door
muriel comes back into the room
what a wonderful friend
darkly whats with this kissing all of a sudden
just because a man is helpful in a business way it doesnt give him extra curricular privileges with my wife
thats a fine thing to say about a friend of fifteen years
testy well i dont like it
every time he goes out of this house he shakes my hand and he kisses you
sharply would you prefer it the other way around
irritably well i dont like it thats all
why is he always hanging around
why doesnt he ever get married or something
assumed innocence because he cant find another girl as sweet and pretty and wholesome as i am
well it it doesnt look right
there are limits to friendship and muriel comes over puts a sympathetic arm around him
darling lets not be silly about this
its not bill its the house youre upset about
sigh i suppose so
do you think its worth all this
of course darling
were not just building a house its a home
a home for ourselves and our children and maybe our childrens children
whimsically its getting awfully crowded with only three bathrooms
they look at each other smile and kiss intimately as we jim and muriel are watching simms who has just taken a typewritten sheet from his files
simms looks at the sheet turns to them a little apprehensively
well here are the estimates
before you look at them i think id better explain dont bother simms
takes the sheet im getting to be an old hand at this sort of jim is halfway into his chair as his eye catches the first bid
there is a sharp musical effect as jim bounces out of his seat
the camera goes in for a close shot of the column of estimates
as the camera irises down on each sum there is a dissonant musical effect
antonio doloroso builders
julius akimbo co
zach tophet payne
john retch son
three shot jim muriel and simms
muriel has read the column over jims shoulder
now obviously these bids are way out of line that is all except john retch and son at twenty one thousand
reacting twenty one thousand
and with some judicious cutting i think we can pare that down to eighteen
weve only asked for the barest necessities frankly with all the extras you two have never mind
hands estimates to simms if youll just send us a bill for your services ill see that its taken care of
takes muriels hand and starts for door now if youll excuse us
where are we going
i am going out to get my head examined
then if i dont jump off the brooklyn bridge im going to find the owner of our building and sign a twenty year lease
as they are about to exit they pause as their eyes are caught by a drawing on an adjacent drawing board
what they see a beautiful pencil and charcoal drawing of their completed prospective house
under it in neat letters is printed jim muriel and simms
they look at the drawing then at each other
jims face softens
muriel looks at him appealingly
quietly whats the name of that contractor
insert jims cost chart
the house rests on the diagonal line at the figure of
as the miniscule jim and muriel watch with apprehension the small figures of smith and hackett are joined by simms john w
retch and several sub contractors who put their collective shoulders to the house and push it past the blandings and up to
a sign on a sawhorse it reads over scene is the thunderous dissonance of the various sounds that go into preliminary construction
a steam shovel in action a bulldozer the sawing of wood and intermittently the loud earth shaking crash of a well diggers rig
as the camera pulls back we see the machines and workmen at their various tasks
the scene has all the rustic peace of the invasion of hollandia
the angle changes and we see jim muriel and bill drive up the improvised driveway very close to the scene of activity
jim and muriel look at their property with unconcealed pride
bill is interested but would like it better if there were less noise
shouting over noise well things are certainly humming
same whats that
same i said humming
as they get out of the car there is an unusually loud crash from the well diggers rig
loud whats going on over there
same thats mr
hes digging our well
what happened to the trout stream with that pure clear cold mountain water
same i decided against it there is a sudden cessation of the steam shovel and complete silence
jim unaware of it continues to shout
the trout stream reacts quietly didnt seem practical
it wasnt exactly a decision dear
to bill we discovered the trout stream dries up in august and the rest of the year its polluted
defensively groping well anyway id rather have artesian water
calcium vitamins artesian indicating whats wrong with that steam shovel
they look off
what they see
a cluster of workmen have gathered around mr
zucca the driver of the steam shovel who is swearing in voluble but undistinguishable italian
jim muriel and bill
better take a look
he starts off for the steam shovel nimbly jumping over a drainage trench
muriel starts to follow pauses unable to negotiate the trench
jim turns in time to see bill pick muriel up and carry her across the trench
as he sets her down sarcastic to jim thank you dear
jim frowns annoyed
they approach the group around the shovel
whats the matter mr
how do you lika that
broka my bucket
two times this week i broka my bucket
what did you do strike a boulder
darkly atsa no boulder atsa ledge
weakly what does that mean
meansa we gotta blast
what do you mean dynamite
a little annoyed what do you mean what do you mean
zucca just explained
hes going to use dynamite and blast until he gets rid of the rock
atsa no rock atsa ledge
blandings means is what precisely is a ledge
lika bigga stone only a bigger
like a boulder
no like ledge
jim looks at muriel and bill
like a ledge
but you dont gotta worry
only cost twenty four cents a cubic foot plussa dynamite ana fuse
but how far will you have to blast
might be a lilla baby ledge mighta run the whole toppa the mountain
appalled at twenty four cents a foot
do you realize what that means
simply meansa we gotta blast
zucca walks off
with quiet resignation well anyway our house will never sink
drily if it does we can always get mr
he raised the normandie
there is a crash from the well digging rig
come to peaceful connecticut another crash trade city soot for sylvan charm
irritably how long does that go on
i dont know
to bill three weeks now at four dollars and fifty cents a foot
asserting his authority i think id better have a little talk with mr
he starts off
muriel and bill curious follow
tesander a stolid new england well digger the soul of industry and candor attacks the earth
jim followed by muriel and bill walks into scene stands by watching him
after a moment oh mr
tesander the motor is making too much noise
tesander looks up shuts off his motor
hows it coming
considers a moment then its comin
with a nod he turns on his motor resumes work
jim exchanges a look with muriel and bill
no no i mean but hes drowned out by the motor
tesander patiently stops his motor looks up
what i meant was how far down are you
tesander looks at his equipment considers
oh bout a hundred and ninety feet
well isnt that pretty deep
thinks it over hes not one for snap judgments then yep
hes about to turn on his motor but jim detains him
do you think maybe youd better try another spot
up to you
i mean well have you hit anything yet at all
thinks it over hit some limestone yesterday
is that good
jim looks at bill who shakes his head with mock commiseration
and right now it looks like were coming into some shale
jim looks at muriel for comfort which isnt forthcoming
course it might turn out to be sandstone
tesander shakes his head no
tesander shakes his head no
might be good
might be bad
one thing you know you got plenty of shale sandstone and limestone
he turns a little helplessly to muriel and bill
on a hot day theres nothing like a nice cool limestone shower
tesander just for the record of course what ever happened to water
oh its there all right
he smiles nods tips his hat to muriel just got to be patient
he turns on his motor goes back to work
jim muriel and bill start to move off
if you ask me this projects getting a little out of hand
defensively nothings getting out of hand at all
ive made a chart of the whole operation and indicates tesander with a few minor deviations i know exactly what every pennys going to cost
coolly and just what does that mean
drily meansa we gotta blast
there is a loud dynamite blast o
as a shower of dirt and rocks cascade down and they run for cover insert jims cost chart jim stands casually above the house holding the line with one hand
the group pushing from below now consists of smith hackett simms retch tesander zucca and assorted sub contractors and workmen
as the house moves up a thousand dollars jim firmly pushes it back
it now rests at
jim and mary
you see mary the average fellow who builds a house doesnt know where he stands from day to day but i do things a little differently
with a few minor deviations i know exactly where every penny is going there is a knock on the door
it opens and bill cole appears briefcase under his arm
come in come in
entering just going over the knapp contracts with old man dascomb and i uh indicates mary can i talk
a little concerned sure
obliquely while i was in there with dascomb the conversation kind of got around to you and uh impatiently what is it
well he didnt say in so many words that ever since you started with that house you havent turned in a decent piece of copy but but you kind of
got the feeling
that if i told you youd know that he knew that you knew that he knew
that you knew
whats he worrying about
the deadlines three months off
ive always the phone rings
just a minute
hands phone to jim mrs
blandings calling from lensdale
tesander struck water
say thats wonderful
to bill weve finally got our well
he extends his hand
jim absently shakes it then listens at phone huh
face falls what do you mean weve got two wells
listens then grimly ill be right out
hangs up rises come on bill wed better get out to lansdale
soberly as he slips into his coat mary have you ever seriously considered building a house
well no offense mr
blandings but my boy friend says that anybody who builds a house today is crazy
you stick with that boy hes got a great future
as he and bill start for the door muriel jim bill simms and retch stand at the edge looking down at the excavation which is partially filled with bubbling water
you mean you hit a spring a bubbling spring right here in our cellar
itll have to be diverted before retch here can lay his cement
dubiously may take a while
pumps are over in jersey
tesander walks into scene looks down at the water
tsk tsk tsk
mild sarcasm water mr
at six feet
indicates and over there just thirty two yards away you had to go down two hundred and twenty seven feet to hit the same water
how do you account for that mr
tesander considers a moment rubs his chin then we ll way it seems to me mr
blandings over here the waters down around six feet and over there its uh down around two hundred and twenty seven feet
jim exchanges a weary look with muriel
special effect it consists of a montage of the following the water being pumped out of the excavation
the cement mixer pouring cement into wheelbarrows
the pouring of the cement floor walls and foundations
planks shingles and plumbing equipment begin to arrive and are strewn about the property
the exterior framing of the house begins to go up
the sheathing is put on
the roof is constructed
jims cost chart
with each successive operation a new workman is added to the already considerable group of people who are pushing the house inexorably upward this against the frantic efforts of a
slowly weakening jim blandings
the exterior sheathing is completed and in the roughest of terms the project begins to resemble a house
among the workmens cars we notice the blandings convertible
a dozen hammers saws trowels etc
are heard in other parts of the house busily rasping and banging away
jim and muriel and bill appear in the doorway before entering the rough unfinished interior of what will eventually be the living room
whats this another closet
this happens to be our dining room
not the dining room dear the living room
indicates theres the fireplace
then wheres the dining room
maybe its that little room off the hallway
thats the breakfast nook
its not the breakfast nook its the powder room
do me a favor dont ever invite me here for a meal
two workmen pass by carrying a few long pieces of lumber
the workmen dont see the blandings
i dont figure this blandings at all
if you gotta build on the windiest hill in connecticut why do you have to pick the windiest side of the hill
to workman you know these new york millionaires theyre eccentric
the workmen pass from view
i think id like to go outside
gesture to door after you rockefeller
as they enter the foyer a carpenter appears
to jim just the man i want to see
would you step over here a second
indicating ill browse around upstairs
as bill starts up the stairs jim and muriel follow the carpenter
pointing up on them second floor lintels between the lally columns do you want we should rabbet them or not
lost the second floor lallys
the second floor lintels between the lallys
oh the lintels between the lallys
from the blueprints you cant tell
you want they should be rabbeted
jim throws a brief look at muriel who is regarding him skeptically
no i guess not
okay youre the doctor
calls hey fellas you got any of them rabbeted lintels set rip em out
after the sheerest pause there comes a shriek of nails brutally withdrawn from timber a loud splintering of wood and then something of the appearance of entrails comes hurtling down
end over end landing with a dusty slap at jims feet
the carpenter exits
muriel gives jim an accusing look
sheepishly it sounded less
expensive to say no
there is another loud screech and more entrails come hurtling down narrowly missing them
muriel yells in the direction from which they came
from upstairs comes a long shrill whistle
instantly all sound of activity ceases and a voice is heard
okay fellas lets quit
to muriel now look what youve done
as muriel turns with apprehension eighteen workmen come trooping down the stairs
conciliatory look men mrs
blandings didnt mean anything
the workmen regard him curiously i mean theres no point in walking off a job just because
a woman makes a silly little remark
its saturday mister
we quit at twelve oclock
this aint a chain gang you know
as the workmen exit the blandings look at each other a little sheepishly start up the stairs
crane shot as the blandings go up the stairs
im just sick
from the outside this house looks like a grain elevator and on the inside everythings miles too small
as they reach the second floor landing we hear o
a steady but muffled pounding
they stop as they hear the thumping
that noise listen
again the thumping its coming from the closet
they rush to the closet open the heavy oak door
bill is inside leaning disgustedly against the wall
the door blew shut
i got locked in
i had this closet built especially for myself
the lock opens from the inside
maybe for houdini not for me
as bill starts to step out jim detains him
nothing to it
a child could work it
look ill show you
he steps inside with bill firmly closes the door
a moments pause
the door re opens
condescendingly you see it just takes a little good old yankee know how
you know dear its just possible the lock worked for you and not for bill
even you could do it
sarcastic thank you
come on ill show you
he ushers muriel inside and the door closes on the threesome
the camera remains on the closed door
go ahead dear just open it
the knob turns jiggles a little but the door remains closed
i dont seem to be able to here let me show you
you just take the knob and turn it clockwise
an efficient clockwise turn of the knob
an impatient doubletwist of the knob
a more forceful rattling of the knob plus a slight kick
a furious rattling pounding and kicking
the door remains closed
as jim turns sheepishly nothing like that good old yankee know how
jim turns back to the door pounds on it yelling hey
somebody let us out of here
muriel is at the shoulder high circular frame solid glass window
she looks out
jim and bill look out
what they see the last of the workmens cars driving away
drily leave a call for seven oclock
afterthought monday morning
jim gives him a look turns back to the window sizing up an escape starts muttering to himself
if i could just get over to that scaffolding
he tests the window frame finds it solid
still muttering seems a shame but i guess its the only way
jim picks up a piece of tar paper
what are you going to do
dont get panicky ill get you out of here
hands tar paper to bill here hold this over the window
as bill somewhat skeptically complies jim picks up a piece of two by four
stand back muriel
jim raises the plank takes a stance
to bill ready
jim swings the window shatters
almost simultaneously there is a click and the door to the closet swings open
as jim turns with a sense of accomplishment his face falls as he and the others see that the erratic door has opened
sweetly in case of emergency break glass
come on bill
as muriel and bill precede jim out of the closet and down the stairs jim pauses speculatively toying with the lock
always worked before
muriel and bill walking down the stairs
from upstairs comes a steady sullen pounding from the interior of the closet
without a word they stop look at each other turn and walk back upstairs
muriel and the children are having breakfast
jim enters in fairly high spirits once again improvising to home on the range
as he sits down home home in connecticut where you have to conform to local traditions customs politics and etiquette
picks up his morning mail starts to thumb through it dad do you suppose i could have a chemistry lab in the basement
preoccupied with mail sure why not
i think its awful
smelling up the house with those horrible chemicals
never mind betsy
to jim dear im going up to the place this afternoon to see about landscaping
bills driving me
preoccupied thats nice
looking up darkly what do you mean bills driving you
a little annoyed why do you always say what do you mean when you know perfectly well what i mean and what you mean
i mean that every time i turn my back bill coles driving you some place or something
hes only being helpful
annoyed tears open a letter i thought he was a lawyer
why isnt he out suing somebody
bicker bicker bicker
to joan another word and you dont get your laboratory
well thats something
jim suddenly explodes crumpling a letter he has just read
well just see about that
concerned what is it dear
ignoring her he reaches for the phone starts to dial
jim whats the matter
into phone sharply mr
william cole please
pause then with rising emotion hello bill
i want you to fight this thing
i know my rights as a citizen
they cant get away with it
what do you mean what am i talking about
the letter of course
from the owner of this building
they want us to move
its a thirty day notice
listens a moment but thats ridiculous
how can i move into a house that isnt even finished
no windows no plaster or paint or or plumbing
listens a moment then with rising emotion now you listen to me
i have no intention of moving in thirty days
this is not legal
im going to fight this thing
and i dont care if it takes every penny ive got
hangs up expectantly well
quietly were moving in thirty days
on muriels reaction two moving vans are approaching the bridge
behind them is the blandings convertible
in it are jim muriel and the children
behind it and attached is a trailer
after a pause over this we hear so came thirty days and they moved
close shot entrance to bridge
as the cavalcade passes through we see in the rear of the trailer jammed among the household effects gussie and a very uncomfortable mr
i mean we moved
the moving vans precede the convertible make the wrong turn
jim stops the convertible at the fork and honks as he impatiently gestures to the drivers to turn in the opposite direction
over this as jim would say it thats the wrong road
any fool knows that
jim starts his car up leading the way
the moving vans turn up the new gravel driveway
jim stops his car and they all look off at the house react with pleasant surprise
what they see long shot the house is rapidly nearing completion
a half dozen men are finishing the exterior painting planing down doors etc
in front a couple of men from the nursery are working on the landscaping
for the first time we as well as the blandings see the property as a clean bright and very attractive new house
well there she is bright and shining and just about complete the residence of mr
moving shot jim and muriel are visibly affected by the sight of their dream house
they exchange a warm intimate smile
not bad at that
the car pulls up stops
efficient scoutmaster all right
everybody piles out of the car
as jim and muriel walk toward the house away from us and bill muriel sentimentally reaches out takes jims hand
guess you cant blame them for feeling just a little bit proud
at the door jim stops indicates that hed like to carry muriel across the threshold
sentimentally look he wants to carry his wife across the threshold
romantic isnt it
joan and betsy
they look on with distinct adolescent disapproval
i guess i meant corny
over muriels playful protest jim starts to pick her up
watch that sacroiliac
fifteen years since youve done this sort of thing
jim manages to lift muriel
nice work tarzan
now lets see if you can make it into the hall
jim carries muriel over the threshold and into the foyer
go right in
dont pay any attention to the sign
the camera pans to a low shot of a sign on the floor of the foyer
it reads full shot foyer
in the b
is a painter varnishing the floor
he looks up in complete dismay as he sees his newly varnished floor being violated
after a couple of steps jim stops suddenly aware of the painter
the painter rises throws down his brush says something caustic
imitating painter dont mind me buddy i just got through varnishing that floor
jim reacts raises a tentative foot the sticky varnish practically holding it to the floor
jim says something
whose bright idea was this
the painter says something points at muriel
jim looks darkly and accusingly at muriel whose weak smile is an admission of guilt
she just wanted everything to be nice and shiny on the day they moved in
jim turns and shouts something to the painter
stop painting that floor and put some planks down in here or some thing
the painter shouts back
okay mister but take it easy
the republicans aint in yet you know
jim reacts turns and walks back out of the foyer desperately trying to match his clearly outlined incoming footsteps
each step is outlined by strands of thick sticky varnish
as jim appears still carrying muriel betsy and joan catch his attention indicate the front wall of the house which is complete except for the windows
a house without windows
well just see about that
abruptly handing muriel to bill he starts off
ahead of him and unnoticed are a layer of newspapers which have been spread out
look out for those papers
but jim has stepped on the papers
they stick to his feet
after a few steps he is aware of it tries to get rid of them
after a few hectic but futile attempts he disgustedly disappears around a corner of the house the newspapers flapping behind him
jim flaps his way up to a workman who is staring at a pile of window casements
around back trying to figure out what to do about them windows
whats the problem
you put windows up
they dont fit
angrily control going oh they dont dont they
he continues on toward the back of the house the newspapers flapping beneath him
simms and retch
more window frames are neatly stacked against the wall
simms and retch react as they see an angry jim blandings flap his way into scene his varnished shoes having picked up additional paper shavings shingles etc
retch hands jim a sheaf of papers
blandings youd better look these over
whats this about the windows
calmly im afraid theres a little slip up
these windows seem to belong to a mr
landings in fishkill new york
i talked to mr
landings this morning
well has he got mine
no he seems to have some windows that belong to a mr
blandsworth of peekskill
where are my windows
as near as we can figure out theyve either been sent to a mr
benton in evanston illinois or a mr
bamberger of phoenix arizona
bill wanders into scene looks over jims shoulder
what are we supposed to do live the rest of our lives in a house without windows
itll just be a matter of a few days
whats a zuz zuz water soft n r
how should i know
indicating youve got one
reading from bill furnishing and installing one zuz zuz water soft n r two hundred and eighty dollars
explosively i will not have any such piece of equipment in my house
im afraid i authorized that mr
blandings to save your boiler and water pipes
the plumbing man assures us the water from your well is the most corrosive in his entire experience in the trade
pursing his lips mm
irritably well if its necessary put it in
were moving in today you know and its in
a final show of authority sharply then get me the bill for it
indicating bill youve got it
all right then
and he stalks off his papers shavings etc
flapping behind him
the moving vans are driving away
a general flurry of activity gussie and several workmen carrying furniture upstairs unpacking barrels etc
muriel list and samples in hand is explaining her color scheme to mr
pedelford a polite cigar smoking noncommittal boss painter
in the b
casually leaning on the bannister is pedelfords taciturn and somewhat skeptical looking assistant
now i want the living room to be a soft green
pedelford nods not quite as bluish as a robins egg but yet not as yellow as daffodil buds
handing him a sample the best sample i could get is a little too yellow but dont let whoever mixes it go to the other extreme and get it too
it should just be sort of a grayish yellow green
making a note mm hmm
they turn to the dining room
now the dining room id like yellow
not just yellow a very gay yellow
something bright and sunshiny
sudden inspiration i tell you mr
pedelford if youll just send one of your workmen to the a p for a pound of their best butter and match it exactly you cant go wrong
making a note mm
this is the paper were going to use here in the foyer
hands sample to him its flowered but i dont want the ceiling to match any of the colors of the flowers
there are some little dots in the background and its these dots i want you to match
not the little greenish dots near the hollyhock leaf but the little bluish dot between the rosebud and the delphinium blossom
is that clear
pedelford looks carefully at the sample then making note mm hmm
the kitchens to be white
not a cold antiseptic hospital white a little warmer but not to suggest any other color but white
now for the powder room i want you to match this thread
hands him thread you can see its practically an apple red
somewhere between a healthy winesap and an unripened jonathan
making note mm
there is a crash from the kitchen
will you excuse me
muriel hastily exits toward the kitchen
pedelford turns to his assistant
got it charlie
deadpan indicating rooms with his thumb green yellow blue white red
joan is on a stepladder helping gussie put away some dishes
remains of two broken plates are on the floor below them
joan you know father was to take care of the heavy dishes
i havent seen him for an hour
betsy flies into the room waving a railroad timetable
wheres uncle bill
i just checked the timetable hes going to miss his train
if theyve run off somewhere it certainly isnt very suddenly stops listens from upstairs comes the sound of a steady methodical thumping of a hand on a solid oak door
she rushes for the door
muriel opens the closet door revealing jim and bill who have been locked in the closet for the last hour
each leans against the wall arms folded in an attitude of boredom and disgust
without a word jim and bill exit from the closet
the three start down the stairs
darkly i thought you were going to take care of it
i thought you were
from below youre going to miss your train uncle bill
it leaves lansdale in twenty five minutes
isnt there a later one
not till the commuters special tomorrow morning at six fifteen
you mean seven fifteen
no dad six fifteen
what about the seven fifteen im supposed to take to the office every morning
consulting timetable theres a little asterisk
the seven fifteen only runs saturdays sundays and holidays
taking timetable let me see that
scans table tightlipped muriel
oh dear dont tell me i read it wrong
for the rest of my life im going to have to get up at five oclock in the morning to catch the six fifteen to get to my office by
eight which doesnt even open until nine and which i never get to until ten
perhaps if you started earlier you could quit earlier
sharply so i could get home earlier to go to bed earlier to get up earlier
maybe you can have the railroad push the train up to four fifteen then you wont have to go to bed at all
uncle bill youre going to miss your train
jim you clean up this mess
ill drive bill to the station and pick up some cold cuts for dinner
betsy and joan pick up some boxes and walk into the dining room
youd better hurry
indicating upstairs closet kind of hate to leave that little place
just four walls and a couple of mothballs but to me itll always be home
preoccupied with timetable so long bill
bill and muriel exit
as jim drifts in still preoccupied with timetable its certainly going to be fun this summer when uncle bill comes up for his vacation
well get in a lot of doubles
looks up from timetable what are you talking about
bills going to europe
no hes not
i heard him and mother talking
hes going to move his vacation up and take a place in lansdale
vaguely annoyed uh huh
then covering up all right come on come on
evening is beginning to fall as muriel drives bill into town
ill scout around and find you a place in lansdale
quickly now youre not going to change your mind about coming up
dont worry ill be on the job
it wont be easy
i promise you a cooks tour of every lamp maker rug weaver and antique shop in lansdale county
philosophically when i married you two i suppose i took you for better or for worse
muriel smiles warmly and in a friendly gesture reaches over and pats his hand
good old uncle bill
drily good old uncle bill
as they exchange an understanding smile it is dark outside and getting quite chilly
the children are unpacking a last barrel
they have made a rather unsteady pile of books and boxes obviously muriels personal effects
jim is in the process of trying to start his first fire in the fireplace
the immediate result is a clouding of the room with smoke
as he backs away coughing he bumps into the pile which falls to the floor spilling open a box which contains among other things muriels diary and a lifetime accumulation
of sentimental trinkets
now look what youve done
betsy coughs her way to the fireplace turns the flue handle
the smoke immediately goes up the chimney and the room starts to clear
father the first principle of lighting a fire is to see if the flue is open
a three year old child knows that
next time we want a fire ill send out for a three year old child
indicates trinkets get that stuff cleaned up and go in and help gussie set the table
its getting late
the children start gathering up the debris
joan picks up some trinkets which have spilled from a cardboard box
look dad your fraternity pins
busy cleaning the fireplace pins
i only had one
there are two of them here
all right all right
just put them away
examining them funny this one says w
on the back
brightly william cole
it must be uncle bills
reaching for it let me see that
examining pin hmmmm
betsy has picked up a small leather bound book
mothers diary when she was in college
its slightly torrid
coming over lets see
sharply thats none of your business
scanning page id say mother and uncle bill were somewhat of an item
taking book from betsy people do not read other peoples diaries
its not a very nice thing to do
shooting them out now go in there and help gussie with the table
indicating debris what about
ill take care of that
now shoo shoo
the children exit
jim is about to put down the diary when his curiosity gets the better of him
making sure hes unobserved he sits down on a box opens the book starts to read
as his brows wrinkle with concern the wind is howling the trees swaying
the lights are on in the kitchen
camera moves up to the open kitchen window
the family in overcoats is huddled around the kitchen table finishing dinner
gussie in overcoat and muffler is clearing the dishes away
jim a sober look on his face rises takes a steaming kettle from the stove
where are you going
while i can still trust myself with a razor
at six oclock in the morning id probably cut my throat
jim abruptly exits
muriel looks after him with concern
jim in his pajamas and overcoat is shaving
after a few moments muriel in her nightgown and overcoat enters the scene
she takes her toothbrush and opens the cabinet jim automatically moving around back of it in their previously established pattern
as muriel puts the paste on her brush replaces the tube shuts the cabinet and starts to brush her teeth jim uncomfortably moves back to his original position
muriel do you have to do that now
theres no need to be so irritable just because you have to shave at night
im not irritable
well youre certainly something
you havent said a civil word all evening
sometimes a man doesnt feel like talking
solicitously what is it dear
something down at the office
have you got the new slogan for wham
its not due yet
well its something
youre certainly upset about something
i can always tell
im not upset
going back to shaving with studied unconcern its just that i dont happen to approve of falsehood and deception
particularly in my own wife
what are you talking about
same oh nothing
its just that i distinctly remember your telling me you gave back bills fraternity pin fifteen years ago
muriel looks at him puzzled
well did you or didnt you
did i or didnt i what
give it back to him
of course i did
if i said i did i did
suddenly sam spade then perhaps youd have the goodness to explain how this happened to fall out of your jewel box
he takes the pin out of his pocket and hands it to her
muriel takes the pin looks at it sentimentally
suddenly she looks at jim and bursts out laughing
whats so funny
youre standing there with your face full of soap and youre jealous
angrily if you were so crazy about the guy why didnt you marry him
beginning to be a little angry because i wasnt in love with him
vindictively thats not what you said in your diary
now really angry oh now youve been reading my diary
a little guilty well it happened to fall open and
happened to look at it
ill just bet
its all over the book so why dont you admit it
you were in love with bill cole
dont be absurd
of course i was in love with bill
in those days i was in love with a new man every week
then why did you marry me
im beginning to wonder
exploding maybe it was those big cow eyes of yours or that ridiculous hole in your chin
maybe i knew that some day youd bring me out to this thirty eight thousand dollar icebox with a dried up trout stream and no windows
or maybe i just happened to fall in love with you but for heavens sake dont ask me why
muriel stalks out of the bathroom
jim looks after her thoughtfully starts to dry his face
muriel stands with her back to him angrily winding the clock
jim noisily clears his throat
would it do any good to say im sorry
i dont know
jim gently turns her around facing him
well i am
i acted like a schoolboy and im sorry
muriel looks at jim
finally she smiles
she goes into his arms and they kiss intimately
as their lips part dreamily why dont you take the soap out of your ears
same why do i love you so much
jim again kisses her tenderly warmly
breathless darling its awfully late
jim kisses her again a little more ardently
same maybe you ought to go down and lock the doors
kissing her ear what for
the windows are all open anyway
as he starts to kiss her again jim you have to get up at six oclock
considers logic prevails brief sigh yes i guess so
reluctantly goodnight dear
each gets into his own bed still wearing the overcoats
insert jims cost chart the house now wavers at
as jim and muriel still try to stem the tide the group that is pushing the house ever upward includes all of the previous people connected with the house and
in addition plumbers painters landscape gardeners etc
over this and across the scene flutter more bills more extras
and so the days sped by and the bills and the extras and as the house approached forty thousand dollars jim approached his deadline for the new slogan
it was almost a photo finish
it is raining
the lights are on in the buildings
mary is attending to some detail work as the door opens and jim enters disturbed
mary looks at him questioningly
youd better send out for coffee and sandwiches
it looks like an all night session
concerned what did he say
wearily seating himself at desk tomorrow morning
sighs well i guess youll just have to dream something up good or bad
i rather got the impression it had better be good
raised eyebrow oh
he picks up a pencil nibbles on it thoughtfully
the silence in the room is broken only by the patter of raindrops on the window
it strikes a note in jims subconscious
he swivels around in his chair and stares soberly out the window
ruminatively almost to himself funny how you look forward to the little things
rain for instance
mary looks at him curiously
he turns to her
for a month now i guess ive been looking forward to the first rainy night at the house
looks at muriels picture big blazing fire
me in my new smoking jacket
with my pipe and slippers reading my paper
sighs oh well
as he starts to work
note the house is painted and almost completely furnished
a hard rain beats on the windows
there is a blazing fire in the fireplace
muriel in a warm bathrobe sits near it comfortably knitting
in fact the scene is exactly the one jim has just described except that the man with slippers pipe and smoking jacket reading the paper is bill cole
near the fire bills rain drenched jacket shirt and shoes are hanging up to dry
the cozy tranquillity is broken by a sharp ringing of the front doorbell
with relief thank heavens
rising stay put
you look too comfortable
the camera follows bill to the front door
he opens it
a man in raincoat and boots stands there in the pouring driving rain
the man enters as bill struggles to get the door shut against the wind
what a night
im jones from down the road
just came over to tell you your kids are all right mr
oh im not mr
coles the name bill cole
he sees jones doubtful look at the smoking jacket feels an explanation is necessary
friend of the family
just came in out of the rain
muriel walks into scene
jones takes in the bathrobe again looks skeptically at bill
williams just called
says your phones out of order
wanted me to tell you the waters rising and theyve got the bridge roped off
girlsll spend the night over at her place
i was beginning to get concerned
can i make you a cup of tea
better be gettin back fore i have to swim for it
to bill night mr
bl weak smile cole
friend of the family
just came in out of the rain
uncertainly well night
and thanks so much
the door is opened with a terrific swirl of wind and rain
jones exits as muriel and bill push the door against the wind finally getting it shut
how do i get back to lansdale
simply youll just have to spend the night right here
as they start back into the living room muriel really
with your husband in new york and your children away think of my reputation
smile dont worry snow white youll be as pure and unsullied in the morning as you were the night before
with resignation thats the story of my life
muriel pokes the dying fire looks up thoughtfully
poor jim he sounded so worried before
i certainly hope he comes up with something
dont worry about the man who gave the world when youve got the whim say wham
this well will never run dry
the camera comes in on a package of cigarettes
a finger impatiently rips open what is left of the package discloses that it is empty
the angle widens to reveal a tired disheveled jim
disgusted he fishes the most likely butt from a tray littered with them
with considerable difficulty he manages to light it only to burn his nose
impatiently stamping out the butt he rises stretches walks to the window pulls up the shade
early morning sunlight floods the room
he turns off a standing lamp looks thoughtfully out the window suddenly gets an idea
turning he snaps his fingers
mary who is asleep on the desk her head resting on her elbows raises her head opens a sleepy eye
selling a note of desperation in his voice compare the price compare the slice take our advice buy wham
mary critically shakes her head no closes her eye
jim wearily throws himself down on the couch absently toys with his already loosened tie
he pulls it up over his nose throwing the balance over the top of his head
suddenly he reacts snaps his fingers
mary opens a sleepy eye
if youd buy better ham
youd better buy wham
its boyle petroleum
if youd buy better oil youd better buy boyle
her eye closes
jim sinks back with defeat his hand dropping over the edge of the couch
it encounters a crumpled piece of paper earlier work
he smoothes the paper scans it kind of likes it
he gets up comes over snaps fingers
mary looks up
this little pig went to market as meek and as mild as a lamb
he smiled in his tracks when they slipped him the axe he knew hed turn out to be wham
a long silent look passes between them
knew hed turn out to be wham
he suddenly and angrily gathers all his papers slams them into the wastebasket
rising panic its gone
ive lost my touch
maybe i never had a touch
maybe whim say wham was an accident
i cant think any more
all ive got on my mind is a house with an eighteen thousand dollar mortgage and bills and extras and antiques and and dejected i dont know
i dont know
mary looks at him sympathetically doesnt quite know what to say
as the camera moves to a close shot of the emotionally distraught jim his eyes go to a large photograph on his desk of muriel and the children
he picks it up looks at it with affection
suddenly he gets an idea
rising with determination he puts on his coat and starts for the door
startled where are you going
home to get some sleep and id advise you to do the same
but but you havent suppose i havent
this isnt the only job in town
but but whatll i tell mr
sharply you just tell him to to with finality you just tell him
it is an especially beautiful sunshiny morning
a rural looking taxi deposits a weary jim who pays the driver
as the cab drives off jim looks speculatively at simms car which is parked there yawns stretches opens the door and enters
under this a slightly sour underscoring of home on the range
as jim comes into the foyer he sees muriel in nightgown and robe talking to mr
she holds the rolled up volume of blueprints that went into building the house
going to him solicitously darling you must be exhausted
how did it go
everything all right
unenthusiastic everythings fine
still in embrace looking up hello simms what brings you out with the morning dew
just dropped by to check the blueprints
some extras came in from retch this morning and therere a couple of things i thought we ought to go over together
arms still around muriel unconcerned really
what are they
well lets see
thumbing through sheets few little things here all right i guess
mortising five butts a dollar sixty eight
lets not quibble about that
a mans entitled to mortise a few butts now and then
next sheet extra nails and screws three dollars eighty nine cents
petty larceny but let him get away with it
now theres one here i frankly dont understand
ah here we are
reads changes in closet twelve hundred and forty seven dollars
did you authorize that
well we probably told him to reacting twelve hundred and what
forty seven dollars
changes in closet
hands bill to jim explosively who does he think we are
looks at bill very businesslike whats this notation refer to detail sheet number one thirty five
indicating blueprints far as i remember that would be something in the back of the house
lets just take a look
as he unrolls the blueprints jim looks suspiciously at muriel
she seems a little nervous
ah here we are
it isnt a closet at all
its off the back pantry
blandings little flower sink
blandings little flower sink
to muriel you didnt authorize any changes did you
they certainly werent changes
what have you done
speaking rapidly a little confused i havent done anything
and what i did was
just nothing at all
what have you done
well rattling off all i did was one day i saw four pieces of flagstone left over from the porch that were just going to be thrown away because nobody
wanted them and i asked mr
retch if he wouldnt just put them down on the floor of the flower sink and poke a little cement between the cracks and give me a nice stone floor
where it might be wet with flowers and things
that was absolutely all i did
during the above speech simms sinks into a chair puts his head in his hands and closes his eyes a fact that isnt lost on jim
thats all you did
just four little pieces of flagstone
to muriel wearily did you by any chance authorize a drain
verge of tears of course i didnt
all i said was i wanted a nice stone floor and mr
retch was just as nice as could be and said youre the doctor and thats all anybody ever said to anybody about anything
jim takes a deep breath turns to simms
sigh plunging in all right i think i can tell you what happened
first the carpenters had to rip up the flooring that was already laid
those planks run under the whole width of the pantry so retch had to knock the bottom out of the pantry wall to get at them
jim and muriel jim looks at muriel as though he were premeditating first degree murder
she averts his gaze
over this then he had to chop out the tops of the joists under the flower sink space to make room for a cradle
i guess he bought some iron straps and fastened them to a big pan to give him something to hold the cement
what with that added load on the weakened joists ill bet he had to put a lally column down there for support too
it was just four little pieces of flagstone and i only quiet
group shot during the following speech we see bill cole in jims pajamas and robe come down the stairs and enter the room
jim and muriel are not aware of his presence
well the main soil pipe runs under there on wall brackets so retch had to get his plumbing man back to take out a section so he could get that
i guess that meant he had to change the pitch of the soil pipe from one end of the house to the other
looks up morning mr
turning hello bill
jim turns away reacts suddenly turns back to bill taking in the pajamas and robe
a little shocked but unwilling to believe the implication of what he sees he looks to muriel for an explanation
lamely the bridge was roped off and bill had to stay last night
cheerily slept like a rock
jim looks at bill then back at muriel
clearing his throat and then of course there are hot and cold water pipes hooked to the joists right under that pantry
they go up to the wing bathroom on the second floor and ill bet my bottom dollar he had to relocate them
three shot jim muriel and bill
jim turns to listen but finds himself looking speculatively at muriel and bill
and i guess the electrician had to rip out about sixty feet of armored cable between the main panel and the junction box by the oil burner including the two
hundred twenty volt cable that goes to the stove
full shot gussie appears in the doorway in raincoat carrying umbrella
what a night
where have you been
couldnt get back across the bridge
werent here last night
they werent letting anybody across that bridge mr
to muriel i passed the girls over at the williams
theyll be along any minute
as jim reacts quickly thank you gussie
youd better get breakfast started
as gussie exits muriel turns to simms
where were we
we were at the two hundred twenty volt cable that goes to the stove
just a minute
looks at bill then at muriel you mean the children werent here last night either
how could they be dear
the bridge was closed
i just came across it
well it was closed last night
pointedly its open now
attempt at breeziness if youll all excuse me i i think ill just go up and slip into something a little more comfortable
simms aware of the tension wants to get out of there
rapidly well thats about the size of it through simms speech jim looks darkly at muriel
except that retch had to repair the pantry wall and that meant getting a plasterer back
and of course he couldnt have broken through that wall all right simms all right
well take care of it
preparing to exit ill admit its a little steep
but ill try to get retch to knock a hundred dollars off the bill
if i cant get that ill certainly try for seventy five
if he doesnt go for seventy five ill take a stab at fifty
you do that
at the door anyway im almost sure we can get twenty five
there is no answer
there is a deadly pause
carefully now dear youre upset youve got a lot of things on your mind with dangerous calm muriel theres only one thing on my mind this house and how fast
we can get rid of it
thats not what youre thinking
maybe its not
maybe im thinking i was once a happy man
the martyr i didnt have a closet i didnt have three bathrooms but i did have my sanity a few dollars in the bank two children who loved me and
a wife i could trust
thats a fine thing to say
i also had a job at danton and bascomb something i dont happen to have at the moment
thats right ive resigned
were starting all over again
and without this house
near tears you love this house
i hate it
in the b
tesander enters cap in hand stands there nervous and embarrassed
you dont mean that
every word of it
anybody who builds a house today is crazy
the minute you start they put you on the list
the all american sucker list
everywhere you turn theyve got a hand in your pocket
if you take out their hands they find more pockets
explosively its a conspiracy i tell you a conspiracy against every man and woman who want a home of their own
against every boy and girl who were ever in love
tesander clears his throat
sharply what do you want
a slight embarrassed pause
then shyly well mr
blandings theres a matter of twelve dollars and eighty six cents
with a wild gleam twelve dollars and eighty six cents
why be a piker mr
emptying pockets take everything ive got
spread it out among your pals
advancing toward the bewildered tesander wouldnt retch like a little something
maybe zucca could use my new dinner jacket
its open house mr
if this isnt enough ill come over to your place and do some odd chores
maybe i can mow your lawn or scratch your back
simply you dont understand mr
this twelve dollars and eighty six cents you dont owe me i owe you
there is a momentary pause
w what was that
taking out money found i overcharged you
almost three feet
he hands the money to jim who stares at it blankly
better count it
i think its all there
jim looks haplessly at muriel sheepish guilty
thank you very much mr
well i guess id better be gettin along
looking around sure got a pretty place here
at door pauses looks back ill tell mr
zucca about the dinner jacket
jim and muriel look at each other a little sheepishly
as tesander is about to exit bill dressed starts down the stairs
tesander could you give me a lift to town
be right with you
concerned what did you mean before about losing your job
will we really have to sell the house
miserable i dont know dear
i dont know
in case anyones interested im leaving for town
for jims benefit if you want to count the silverware ill wait
sheepishly bill be patient with me
maybe one of these days ill grow up
to muriel what happened to him
twelve dollars and eighty six cents
mind if i say something
jim and muriel look at him curiously
you know ive kind of been the voice of doom about this whole project
every step of the way i was firmly convinced you were getting fleeced bilked rooked flimflammed and generally taken to the cleaners
and maybe you were
maybe it cost you a whole lot more than you thought it would
maybe there were times when you wished youd never started the whole thing
but when i look around and see what you two have here i dont know
pause maybe there are some things you should buy with your heart and not with your head
maybe those are the things that really count
see you around
as bill turns and leaves the outer door is heard opening and the kids appear
there is an exchange of his as they pass
surprised hi dad
how come youre not at the office
a look at muriel im on a
kind of a vacation
you mean you got fired
well not exactly i well discuss it later
gussies head appears from the kitchen
brightly come and get it
what are we having gussie
orange juice scrambled eggs and you know what
making a face ham
not ham wham
cheerily if you aint eatin wham you aint eatin ham
gussies head disappears
close shot jim
what did she say
he reacts with the sudden exhilaration of balboa first seeing the pacific
he snaps his fingers
darling give gussie a ten dollar raise
his eyes light up as he begins to visualize
insert advertisement in magazine it is a picture of gussie smiling holding a platter with an enormous ham
under it the simple caption the camera angle widens to disclose mr
james blandings reclining in a hammock on the patio of his dream house
in the b
muriel is working at her garden joan and betsy assisting her
jim reacts with pride and satisfaction as he sets the magazine down takes a long drink of lemonade and picks up a book which he has been reading
as the camera comes in for an extreme close shot of jim we see the title of the book on the jacket cover
it reads jim looks up over the top of the book directly into the camera and winks
with simple sincerity drop in and see us sometime
