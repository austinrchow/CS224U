screenplay by robert ramsey and matthew stone a handful of people are gathered in an open field under a fierce mississippi sun
a couple of young inmates jake and leon lean on their shovels
they are waiting to bury two identical caskets with inmate numbers stenciled on the pinewood lids
a guard rests the butt of his rifle on the ground and takes a long healthy pull from his canteen
he offers it to the prison chaplain who is much obliged
superintendent bill burke a year old black man glances at his watch and loosens his tie
sure is hot
mary humphries an elderly white woman in a nurses uniform stands behind willie long an ancient inmate sleeping peacefully in a wheelchair
she readjusts an umbrella to shield the old black man from the blistering sun
burke dabs his forehead with a handkerchief
he gives the nod to the chaplain who steps forward and cracks his bible
the men remove their hats
in accordance with the regulations of the state of mississippi we gather here today to lay to rest the remains of inmates r
gibson number and c
ashes to ashes dust to dust
may god have mercy on their souls
go ahead fellas
the young inmates plunge their shovels into the dirt
one by one the mourners head back toward a prison van parked on a nearby dirt road
ill come back for you in a little while willie
she leaves willie alone with jake and leon
he rolls his chair up to the edge of the graves and gazes at the pinewood caskets
these two guys friends of yours old man
we spent some time together
why do i get the feeling when you say some time you mean some time
i was already here a good many years when they came in in
thats like thats like
sixty five years ago
they always said the farm couldnt hold em forever
looks like youre finally free boys
willie pulls a bottle of moonshine from his jacket and takes a swig in their honor
hey the dudes holdin
come on old timer hook the brothers up
willie passes the bottle to leon who takes a swig and winces from the unexpected kick
hell of a way to get out
heard they burned up in that fire yesterday
i seen the bodies before they sealed em up
them fellas sizzled up good
looked like some shit from the x files
taking a swig from the bottle damn that shits nasty
rays special recipe
he always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned
what were they bootleggers
willie holds up the bottle checking the clarity of the liquor
something like that
ray gibson holds up a similar bottle of liquor to a light over a door
music comes from within
he takes a swig and stashes the bottle in his belt
he adjusts his tie polishes his shoes on the back of his pants and raps on the door
the speakeasy is jumping jammed with people
up on stage a hot jazz band is playing backup for a seductive chanteuse
well heeled patrons enter through doors near the stage
in the back at the end of a long hallway a bouncer cracks open the door and ray squeezes inside
oh no ray
spankys not happy with you
is spanky here
then whats the problem
do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door
but this is where the action is and i have to be where the action is
look when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes didnt i come through for you
aint she stepping in style now
well alright then
what do you think about this new tie
i look good tonight
and i feel lucky too
ray heads inside
anyone asks it wasnt me who let you in
ray slides through the crowd pausing at the bar to nibble on the neck of a cocktail waitress
dont even try it
when do you get off
i get off at two but you aint never getting off
she carries a tray of drinks into the crowd
ray shakes his head in wonderment at her departing form
the barkeep steps up as ray pulls out his bottle
you cant drink that in here ray
i sure cant drink that watered down swill youre serving
give me a glass of ice
i cant give you a glass of ice
i cant give you anything until you pay your damn tab
disregarding the warning ray tilts the bottle back
shaking his head the barkeep moves on to a paying customer
rays eyes follow a bottle of french champagne as it is delivered to a nearby table
here sits the straight laced claude banks with his girlfriend daisy
shes enjoying the show
hes polishing the silverware
the waiter pours two glasses of champagne and leaves the bottle on ice
claude regards his glass skeptically
for the kind of money they charge here youd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes
heres to your new job down at the bank
i always knew youd make something of yourself
know what im going to buy with my first pay check
daisy thinks she does
she leans in eyes twinkling
season tickets to the yankees
right there on the first base line
off her disappointment whats wrong baby
i was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring claude
french champagne shoots out of claudes nose
thats what respectable folks do
get a job get married start having babies
thats what you want isnt it
sure it is
i just dont see any reason to rush into things
damn look at this shirt
ill be right back
claude leans in to kiss daisy on the lips
she offers her cheek
ray watches claude make a beeline for the mens room
claude steps into the bathroom and approaches the sink
a big hand falls on his shoulder and yanks him backwards into a stall
claude is shoved down on the toilet by two bag men in suits
suddenly its crowded in here
we understand you finally got yourself a job
guess that means you can pay mr
riley the fifty bucks you owe him
they rifle through claudes jacket and quickly find his wallet
now wait a second guys
ive got a bill to pay out there
twenty two dollars
not bad for a start
they toss back his empty wallet
come on fellas thats two weeks pay
im here with my girl
you gotta leave me something
how about your legs
those are good ill keep the legs
the stall door swings shut as the bag men depart
on his way into the mens room ray squeezes past the bag men on their way out
glancing around ray spots claudes feet under the stall door
he steps up to the sink washes his hands and takes a towel from the attendant
scanning the assortment of grooming products he selects a bottle of cologne and takes a sniff
displeased you have any of that french stuff
as the attendent bends down to retrieve a bottle of the good stuff ray palms a coin from the tip basket
here you go
ray offers the quarter a gesture of uncommon generosity
keep the change
why thank you sir
ray pats the cologne on his face
a toilet flushes and claude steps over to the sink
ray catches his eye in the mirror
dont i know you
i dont think so
sure i do
whats your name again
how could i forget that
youve got to remember me
we went to high school together
you went to monroe
beaming thats right
good old monroe
ray throws his arms around claude deftly snatching his wallet
claude extracts himself from rays embrace
well i went to jefferson so you must have a different claude banks in mind
claude straightens his jacket and heads for the door
ray stashes the stolen wallet in his jacket
on the stage the chanteuse has downshifted into a sultry number about back door lovers and broken dreams
ray steps out of the mens room and is instantly collared by bullethead a man who makes his living being large and threatening
watch the threads bullethead
if this is about my tab ive got it covered
pressed up against the wall ray reaches into his jacket and produces claudes wallet
bullethead snatches it inspects it and is not impressed
this aint about your tab ray
youve got bigger problems than that
he stuffs the wallet back into rays jacket and hustles ray out the back door past the bouncer who let him in
is that ray gibson
who the hell let him in here
claude returns to the table where daisy is sipping champagne
he takes the glass out of her hand
come on honey lets get out of here
but im having a good time
excuse me sir i believe you forgot this
the waiter presents claude with the bill
of course the bill
we couldnt leave without paying the bill
especially such an incredibly large bill
claude is shoved into the back of the van and the doors are slammed behind him
he bangs and shouts but its no use
save your energy claude
youre gonna need it
ray is stretched out against the back wall
claude is knocked to the floor as the van lurches into motion
here this belongs to you
tossing claude his wallet it was empty when i found it
good old monroe
ray swigs from his bottle and offers it to claude who isnt interested
what i want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when i caught up with you in the
i dont see where thats any of your business
did those two muscle heads shake you down
swear ive seen them down at the track with sure shot riley
thats it aint it
a gambling debt
busted claude snatches the bottle and carefully wipes off the neck before tilting it high
ray gets a good chuckle out of this straight cat in the bow tie
where they taking us anyway
probably to spankys headquarters down at the pier
good im looking forward to meeting this spanky
give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess
i cant wait to see that
you slay me man
the van pulls into a the loading bay of a warehouse at the end of a short pier on the harlem river
bullethead and a henchman pull ray and claude from the back of the van
they find themselves in a dark warehouse filled with crates of contraband
sotto what are they gonna do to us
dine and ditch right
claude nods over ten bucks
he nods again youre probably looking at a thumb
what do you mean like cut it off
for ten bucks
ray nods that include the tip
claude shoves his hands under his armpits at the sound of approaching footsteps echoing across the vast space
claude and ray peer into the darkness
from the darkness you picked the wrong night to fuck with me ray
i just lost three men and a truck full of canadian whiskey
you know what that kind of thing does to my business
it makes me want to lash out and hurt somebody
spanky johnson emerges into the light
he uses a small silver spoon to take an ample snort of cocaine into each nostril
he glances at claude
friend of yours ray
i never saw this man before tonight
hes a lowlife degenerate who lurks in bathrooms
im a professional man an upstanding citizen
i go to church on sunday
then what are you doing here
failure to pay
rattled look mr
johnson you seem like a reasonable man
i got a good job starts monday
ill pay you back with my first pay check
i dont want to tell you how to conduct your business but if you cut off my finger you wont get jack
working an adding machine i gotta be whole
his fingers dancing over imaginary keys i need my thumbs and all my fingers for praying and doing good
spanky holds up a hand silencing claude
the choirboy wants to keep his fingers
who am i to argue
what does drop him mean
claude protests loudly as bullethead and the henchman bind his hands and feet
spanky turns to ray
you gotta lotta balls showing your face around my club
if a mans gonna run numbers on my side of broadway you think hed have the common sense to keep a low profile
but not ray gibson
the goons hoist claude up on another pulley and dangle him head first over a hole in the floor
several feet down the harlem river laps against the wooden pylons
no not down there
that waters filthy
help me out here man
shrugging ray pinches his nose and puffs out his cheeks
the goons release the rope and claude plunges into the water
spanky turns back to ray
you dont have to drown that fella spanky
you already scared him half to death
he didnt know who he was fucking with
but you do
what does that say about you ray
what does that say about me
ive given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father
but he didnt last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so i guess im gonna have to school you myself
come on spank im just trying to get by here
you remember how it was when you were starting out
the henchman yanks on the rope
claude emerges from the hole gasping for breath
i was supposed to wear this suit on monday
the henchman releases the rope sending claude back into the water
ray reaches into his jacket
bullethead pulls a gun and presses it into rays temple
ray gives him a look and cautiously pulls out his bottle
whats that some of your bathtub brew
puerto rican rum
see for yourself
ray tosses him the bottle
spanky uncorks sniffs samples the goods
whered you get this
comes up the mississippi
i can get more
a lot more
i was thinking about going into business for myself but under the circumstances id be willing to take on a partner
once again the henchman yanks on the rope and claude comes up sucking air desperately
he releases the rope submerging claude for a third time
all i need is the front money and a truck
i could be back in two three days tops if i had somebody to share the driving
spanky considers the terms
can he afford to trust ray
can he afford not to
if you fuck me on this one ill spare no expense
alright ray youve got a deal
pick your man and get going
ray glances around
the pulley rope is still twitching in the water
ill take the little choirboy if you dont mind
if i was you id want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot
i just want somebody who wont put a bullet in my back once the truck is full
spanky sees rays point
he nods to the henchman who hoists claudes limp body out of the water and onto the cement
spanky plants a foot on claudes chest and applies pressure
a geyser of harlem river water shoots from claudes mouth as he sputters back to life
for your sake i hope you can drive
somebody give him some dry clothes
the camera moves up the side of the old ford truck to find claude sitting pensively in the passenger seat
ray palms the wheel
tell me about that hot sketch you were hypin last night
she was a choice bit of calico
you two been seeing each other a long time
gonna slap the handcuffs on her and stroll down the aisle one of these days
tight lipped claude shifts in his seat
sometimes i wish i could find me a sheba to settle down with
suppose im just a tomcat by nature
trying to fill the silence this little rum run is gonna seriously improve my relationship with spanky
hes a good man to have on your side
hes got the capital and the connections
thats what you got to have in that business
spankys place is pretty plush but one of these days im gonna open up my own establishment
rays boom boom room
you like that
rays boom boom room
thats in the groove dont you think
if claude does like it hes not letting on
come on daddy o
you havent said a word since we started
least you could do is make some friendly conversation
look man i dont want friendly conversation
i dont want to be your friend
ive seen your friends and i dont like them
i just want to do this thing and get back to new york in time to start my job
start your job
what kind of job
well if you must know bank teller at first federal of manhattan
im responsible for keeping track of hundreds occasionally thousands of dollars
thats some long green
damn straight it is
i got my own set of keys because im supposed to open up
so if i aint there a
monday morning theres gonna be hell to pay
beat of silence
ray laughs to himself
no tell me whats so funny
i dont know
sounds like ladies work to me
well maybe i should dig around in other peoples clothes for money
its obviously been highly successful for you
hey youd be surprised what you find in other peoples pockets
just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers
get you every time
i didnt start out to be a bank teller
i was gonna be a ballplayer
even had an offer to play short for the newark eagles
why didnt you take it
the negro league dont pay so good
and youre always on the road
that dont wash with daisy
you gave up baseball to be a bank teller
i cant latch on to that
at some point a mans got to get serious about his future
im sure you have no idea what im talking about
youre talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller
bank tellers just a start
i got plans
not opening some zoom boom room
this time next year ill be a loan officer
a loan officer
thats right a loan officer
so you mean if i needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running id have to hype some square like you
ray pulls out his pocket watch
a mechanical tune plays as he checks the time
how would i get a loan anyway
you need collateral
re watch like this
whod you steal it from
my daddy gave me this watch
whod he steal it from
my daddy is dead so watch your mouth
you can say what you want about me but dont be dragging my daddy into it
this watch means the world to me
keeps perfect time
looks like a fake to me
ray stuffs his daddys watch back in his pocket
ah go chase yourself
ill take my business elsewhere
and for future reference you are no longer welcome at rays boom boom room
there is no boom boom room
when there is you can forget about it
and i swear to god you ever talk about my daddy again im gonna kick your bank telling loan denying ass you got me
i think i liked you better when you kept your trap shut
the truck veers off the highway and jerks to a halt in front of the rundown establishment
a dozen white folks look up as ray and claude push through the door
man something smells good in here
hows everybody doing
nothing but sullen stares from all corners of the room
sotto maybe we oughta find another place
are you kidding
tell me you dont want a slice of that pie right over there
i must have left my appetite outside which is where i think we ought to be right now
claude tugs ray towards the door but ray wont be dissuaded
he boldly addresses a young man in an apron behind the counter
good evening billy
wed like some coffee and a couple of slices of that homemade pie youve got advertised
how you know my names billy
it says so right there on your shirt
glancing down that what that says
billys mama sets a piping hot pie on the back counter and steps up next to her son
she casts a disparaging glance at claudes suit
if you boys can read so good how come you missed that sign in the window
claude considers the sign shes pointing to
you mean this sign
the one that says no coloreds allowed
thats a good question
ray how come we missed the sign
look maam weve been driving all day
wed just like to purchase one of those pies and well be on our way
those are whites only pies
got any nigger pies
claude jabs him
any fool could see those are whites only not for blacks come on lets get the fuck outta here pies
thank you very much
claude starts tugging ray toward the door
sotto thanks for backing me up here uncle claude
sotto dont uncle claude me
you get a load of those crackers
couldnt be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of em
why you want to pick a fight with people like that for
whatd you say
diner patrons stare
i said youre soft
hey man dont ever call me that
i call it like i see it and what i see is definitely soft
claude narrows his eyes
you want some pie
yeah i want some pie
okay then im gonna walk over to that counter and get us some fucking pie
resolved claude stomps over to the counter
excuse me maam i bet a brick will turn that one right there into a colored pie
claude lays down a dollar bill
mama casually pulls a shotgun from under the counter
and i bet this right here will turn you into a colored pie
okay ray i think we can go now
ray gives the whole place a cool once over as claude pulls him out the door
mama turns to billy still studying the stitching on his shirt
dont be concentrating so hard baby
youre liable to seize yourself again
the truck rolls up to the waters edge
ray kills the engine and flashes the lights twice
in the passenger seat claude is fast asleep
after a few moments a fat man appears shining a flashlight into the cab
how you doing
were looking for slim
you found him
ray cocks an eyebrow
under cover of darkness a couple of men finish loading crates into the bed of the truck
ray and claude keep their eyes peeled for the law
down by the river they can see lights and hear music from a district of rowdy juke joints
slim steps up wiping his hands
thats it fellas
thirty six cases of puerto ricos finest
at five bucks a case thats
ray pulls out a wad and slaps it in slims sweaty palm
the fat man starts counting it out
man that music is hot
what goes on down there slim
thats natchez under the hill
blacks welcome there
greens the only color that matters under the hill
they got gambling girls
you oughta check it out
maybe we will
nice meeting you
slim slips into the shadows
nice meeting you
youve been here before havent you
what gave you that idea
oh i dont know maybe because our lives depend on it i just sort of thought you knew what you were doing
dont get all agitated on me
i bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes i heard em talking
let me get this straight
we drove all the way down to klan country cause you heard a couple of guys talking
what are you complaining about
it worked out
now come on lets head down there and see whats shaking
we deserve a little reward
there are people down there having fun
i want to be one of them
i want you to be one of them
on monday you can be a bank teller if you want but tonight youre a bootlegger with a truck full of puerto rican rum and a fistful of cash
a look of excitement crosses claudes face but he quickly shakes it off
thats gas money
exasperated ray stuffs a few bills into claudes pocket
theres your gas money
you stay here and watch the truck
and dont worry ive got the keys
left alone claude mutters and kicks at the dirt
he leans against the truck
ray emerges from the woods and heads down the hill toward the juke joint
claude hustles up next to him
im just gonna keep an eye on you make sure you dont do nothing stupid
a ramshackle den of iniquity on the banks of the mississippi
the band is laying down some serious delta blues creating an inviting atmosphere for sin and moral corruption
on a far side of the room ray is playing poker with some locals
he seems to be having a bad night
winston hancock a formidable black man sweeps in another big pot and puffs happily on his cigar
perched on a stool claude shoots a dark look at ray and motions for the door
ray waves him off and returns to his game
claude becomes aware of a soft young female hand on his shoulder
ive never seen you in here before
staring at the hand thats because ive never been here before
whats your name
against his better judgement claudes gaze follows the long slender arm up past a bare shoulder and settles on sylvias angelic face
he is struck dumb
cant you remember your own name
i know it begins with a c
c how about buying a girl a drink
to the bartender two bourbons
i really shouldnt
i gotta keep an eye on my friend
he looks like he can take care of himself
the drinks arrive
she places a shot glass in claudes reluctant hand
she winks provocatively and slowly pours the whiskey down her throat
instinctively claude tosses back his shot
thats my name
thats never happened before
you have any money claude
but i need it to get home
why would you want to go home
its so early
the bartender refills their glasses
winston considers his cards hardly looking up as a waitress lays down a cocktail napkin and sets a drink down on top of it
he glances at ray who casually considers his cards
ill take two
the dealer tosses ray a couple of cards
insert ray fans his cards to reveal a full house
after considering the other players at the table ray pushes whats left of his money into the center of the table
the three other players fold with disgust
winston squints long and hard at ray then pushes everything he has into the center of the table
ill see that
winston reaches into his jacket and throws down some more money on the pile
and while were at it lets sweeten the pot
looks like my sugar bowls empty mr
reaching for the pot thats just too damn bad aint it
now hang on slick
i aint through with you yet
ray checks his cards again
he looks at the pot its a lot of money
with this hand theres no way he can lose
he places his daddys pocket watch on top of the pile
winston checks the time piece
thatll cover it
ray lays down his hand
full boat ladies doing the paddling
ray sits back stunned
winston rakes in his winnings
the game is over for the night
the three other players head to the bar
dont take it too hard new york
have a round on me
winston tosses a silver dollar to ray who snatches it out of the air
winston drops his hat on his head and moves through the crowd and out the door
can i get you something
ray shakes his head
carefully she begins to clear the table
suddenly he grabs her wrist
winstons glass tips over
ray flips over the cocktail napkin to reveal an extra pile of cards
looks like he had a whole lot of nothing in his hand until you came along
wrenching free youre hurting my arm
ray dashes into the street glancing both ways
no sign of winston
winston produces rays pocket watch and pops it open
a smile crosses his face as the mechanical tune plays
a sheriffs sedan rounds a corner illuminating winston in its headlights
the car pulls up and sheriff warren pike steps out
distinguished by a casual cruelness hes a young white man who loves his uniform
if it isnt winston hancock
winston tries to move past pike but the sheriff blocks his path with a night stick
as winston backs off another squad car pulls up behind him
two deputies step from the car guns drawn
i thought we agreed that you were gonna leave town
i tried to leave sheriff pike
but your wife begged me to stay
pike slams winston with his club sending the black man to his knees
as winston struggles back to his feet a stiletto flashes and he lunges for the sheriff slashing his cheek
the deputies grab winston from behind holding him by both arms
the long knife clatters to ground
pike touches his face examining the blood on his fingers
you just committed suicide boy
ray walks slowly down the hallway to room
he is about to knock when he hears the sound of lovemaking from within
ray opens the door and peeks in
sylvias on top and in charge
claude is concentrating real hard
ray smiles to himself and closes the door
claude hitches up his suspenders as he comes down the stairs
he finds ray having a drink at the now empty bar
ive been looking for you
here i am
guess we better get going huh
still got that ten dollars
well not exactly
see i met this girl
real nice girl
god fearing girl
her names sylvia
that jelly you were talking to right here
shes in a tight spot
her mama needs this operation and they aint got the money for it
their church took up a collection but they were still short
so you made a generous contribution
what can i say
when the spirit moves me
that was mighty charitable of you claude
looks like we both got fucked tonight
what are you talking about
while you were upstairs doing gods work i was getting jack legged by a fool with four threes
you lost all our money in a card game
he even got my daddys watch
fuck that cheap ass watch off rays glare i mean how the hell are we gonna get home without any money
weve still got cases of rum
thats better than money
ray and claude head down the alley
you sure the trucks this way
looking over his shoulder i swear it was back that way
suddenly the bloodied figure of winston hancock lurches from the shadows and grabs claude by the lapels
claude is too scared to scream staggering backward
but the mans grip loosens and he slips to the ground
ray turns back to find claude trembling with fear and covered in blood
he just points down
ray eyes widen
he kneels down and turns winstons body over
i think hes hurt pretty bad
oh man ive never seen a dead body before
much to claudes horror ray starts rifling through winstons pockets
what do you think youre doing
the mans been dead for two seconds
dont you have any respect
it aint here
what aint there
my daddys watch
this is the dude i was telling you about suddenly the glare of two bright headlights from a pickup truck freeze ray and claude in a guilty tableau
five white men appear at the end of the alley
whats going on here
ray gingerly releases winstons lifeless body
whats wrong with that one
hes just drunk
yeah nobody puts em away like old whats his name
his names winston
come on ray better get winston back to the truck
claude and ray hoist winstons body to its feet
the man raises his lantern takes a closer look at winstons face
this fella looks dead
ray and claude check for themselves
would you look at that ray
winston up and died on us
hell with him then
if he cant share the driving he cant ride in the truck
he can ride with us
suddenly the men all have guns
and theyre pointed at ray and claude
so can you
in a holding cell ray tests the window bars
meanwhile claude sits on a cot brooding darkly
through the bars we see the rednecks laughing and passing around a bottle of bootleg rum with the deputy on duty
man this is gonna delay everything
spankys gonna be pissed
spankys gonna be pissed
what the hell kind of a name is spanky anyway
youre responsible for this situation
i blame you for everything
if it wasnt for you id be home having a hot meal right now
if it wasnt for me youd be washing up on the beach at coney island right now
mocking claude i need all my thumbs and fingers for praying and doing good
the jailhouse door opens and sheriff pike walks in
he pauses to give the prisoners the once over
theres a fresh bandage over the cut on his cheek
what do we have here
billy bob and the boys found them down down under the hill with winston hancock
he was dead
looks like murder
you dont say
looks like they was running rum
got thirty six cases of evidence out back
you want i should call in the federal prosecutor
lets not drag the feds into this
i can think of better uses for that rum than letting it collect dust in some government warehouse up in nashville
pike winks at his deputy then turns to regard the prisoners
besides why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder
excuse me sheriff
as we explained to your associate here theres been a mistake
we didnt kill anybody
now as for the bootlegging we happen to work for a very important man in new york
does the name spanky johnson mean anything to you
johnson is very well connected
if you were to let us go i guarantee he would show you his appreciation if you know what i mean
are you offering me a bribe
im just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice
you may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in new york city but down here we take murder seriously
look man how many times we gotta tell you people we didnt kill that guy
well if thats the case then you dont have anything to worry about do you
pike turns his back on the prisoners and checks the time on a gold pocket watch rays pocket watch
but from his cell ray cant hear the mechanical tune
time to get home to the missus
see yall in the morning
in the cell claude turns to ray
the mans gotta point
were innocent after all
i just gotta get a good nights sleep on this filthy mattress
keep our heads on straight stay cool whats the worst thing that could happen to us
the camera scorseses in on the judges face
the gavel comes down with a thundering crash
stunned ray and claude resist the bailiffs efforts to remove them from the courtroom
how long is life
we were just walking back to the truck
we didnt do nothing
whats life mean
theres no way i can do life
i got a job starts monday morning
they continue to protest loudly as they are dragged bodily through the door
blues music kicks in as a prison transport bus rolls down a dirt road cutting through the bleak mississippi delta
long chain charlie a white prison sergeant sits behind the wheel
a shot gun hangs within easy reach
the camera moves back past grim faced prisoners with their hands and feet shackled
we arrive at ray and claude sitting in grim silence as the bus lurches along
the bus veers off the country road and passes under a sign mississippi state penitentiary
dillards voice plays welcome to the farm
here you will be provided with ample opportunity to repay your debt to society through the rigors of hard labor
ray and claude stare out the window getting their first look at the harsh reality that awaits them
cotton fields stretch to the horizon in every direction
hoe gangs till the earth under the watchful gaze of trusty shooters
in between harvest and planting season we got fields need clearing roads need building and ditches need digging
you will eat only what you can grow
your crop dont come in youll go hungry
if you die dont worry bout us none
well find somebody to replace you
along the road convicts cast hard looks at the new men as the cart passes
a white sergeant on horseback shifts his rifle and casually spits tobacco juice in the dirt
a low slung single story bunkhouse surrounded by a dirt yard
two shooter shacks sit at diagonal corners of the yard
in each shack two trusties with rifles keep vigilant watch over the camp
fred dillard paces down the line of new men as hoppin bob an uncommonly ugly trusty unlocks their leg irons
this here is camp
camp is for incorrigibles so whatever youve done to get here believe me were not impressed
you new men are probably noticing that we have no fences here at camp
we dont need no fences we have the gun line
it runs from shack to shack clear around the yard
you are now inside the gun line
if you step outside the gun line without my permission you will be shot
if you trip and fall over the gun line you will be shot
if you spit if you pee if you stick your ass out and take a dump over the gun line you will be shot
dillard plucks a hat off one of the new prisoners and tosses it over the gun line
shots ring out from the nearest shack
the hat is torn to shreds
one of my trusties puts a bullet in you when youre trying to run im liable to give him a pardon for saving me the trouble of tracking you down
so you can bet their aim is true
dillard puts a cigarette in his mouth
hoppin bob is right there with the flame
my name is sgt
in the unlikely event that you need to address me you call me boss
you already met this handsome fella right here
hoppin bobs my ace boon coon
you run afoul of hoppin bob you run afoul of me
nodding to bob dillard saunters off
new men strip down
ray and claude share a look
self consciously the men begin to undress
double bunks line the walls with a footlocker for each inmate
as usual theres a poker game going on
okay ladies got some fresh meat for ya
all activity comes to a halt as the new men shuffle into the cage wearing their prison issue ring arounds
hoppin bob slams the metal doors shut behind them
we aint got no wallflowers at camp
everybody gotta dance eventually
but dont worry they wont try nothing tonight
that would take all of the fun outta the courtship
the incorrigibles hungrily eye the new men in total silence
claude sticks close to ray as they shuffle toward their assigned bunks
the camera settles on a much younger willie the inmates jump down from the mule cart and grab hoes and shovels
because he cant count hoppin bob keeps track of the men using a system all his own a pebble in his pocket for each man
dillard stands by with his shotgun
got three miles of ditch to clear today
lets keep it moving
the men of camp labor under the brutal mid day sun
jangle leg a handsome muscular man sings a verse to set the work tempo
up and down the line a mighty chorus responds
the camera finds ray and claude swinging pick axes sweating profusely
i dont believe this before abe jive
i didnt go to night school to sing in no mississippi boys choir
claude stops to catch his breath and take off his shirt
i wouldnt do that if i was you
its too damn hot
what do you know anyway
a shot rings out
claude hits the ground as a bullet kicks up some dust nearby
claude looks up to see dillard cracking pistachio nuts as hoppin bob puts another round in the chamber of his rifle
why aint his pick swinging
echoing why aint that pick swinging
its too hot boss
he says its too hot boss
too hot huh
well you tell that lazy jiggaboo the state of mississippi aint interested in his meteorological assessments
listen up jiggaboo
state of mississippi aint interested in your
off dillards look metropolitan assets
tell him the state of mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown
state of mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown
you got that
i got it
he dont sound like hes from round here
hes from new york city
that one too
thats up north aint it
theyll find we do things different down here
annoyed dillard jabs the butt of his rifle into rays solar plexus
ray sinks to his knees in the dirt
looks like we got a couple of live ones
how long these boys in for
judge gave em the long ride
they step outta line again well shorten up that sentence real fast
dillard swaggers off dogged at the heels by the ever faithful hoppin bob
resigned ray and claude return to their labor
the men rest in the ditch as biscuit a slight inmate with a red bandanna tied around his head dispenses water one ladle per man
drink it up
willie exchanges two cigarettes for a second ladle
poker face pulls a crumpled envelope from his shirt
his expression never changes hence the name
either of you new fellas know how to read
ive had this letter four months now
you cant read
none of these guys can read
last fella who could read made parole round christmas
i dont even know who this is from
here gimme that
ray unfolds the letter and scans it
its from your mamas neighbor mrs
she thought you oughta know that your second cousin bo died
the prisoners express their condolences
thats some bad news
i know you loved bo like a brother
and your other cousin sally on your daddys side she died
more sympathy from the men
twice in one letter
rough break poker face
apparently your sister died
no it says marleen here
relief all around
oh wait looks like jenny died too
bad luck man
then it goes on for a while about how the crop didnt come in on accounta the frost
flips over the page she finishes up with something about a tornado and how your mama and your daddy died in that
but dont worry none
shell take care of the dog
that is if it gets over the worms
the prisoners share dark looks
ray folds up the letter and hands it back to poker face
anybody else need anything read
no man were good
the men shake their heads and return letters and cards to their pockets
jangle leg nods and switches places with one of the convicts parking next to claude
how you doin
im all right
you ever done time before
ive been in and out of prison my entire life
im hard core
then you wont have no problem making the adjustment
you need anything help of any kind gimme a holler
names jangle leg
as they shake jangle leg inspects claudes hand thoroughly
soft and supple
like a ladys
eyes narrowing i try to moisturize regularly
over his shoulder hey jangle leg whatd i tell you about pitching woo on the job
claude snatches back his hand and gives jangle leg a hard look
back to work
as the men grab their tools and return to work claude leans over to ray
why do you think they call him jangle leg
somebody just told me he wins the three legged race every year
he does it all by himself
wincing with each movement and covered in grime from the days labors the new men bring up the back of the chow line
cookie the grub slinger slaps a large dollop of an unidentifiable substance onto rays tray
what is that
creamed chip beef on toast
except were outta beef so i had to improvise
cant i get one of those steaks you got grilling back there
those are for trusties unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs
another prisoner lays down some tobacco and gets a juicy steak
ray grabs a hunk of corn bread and makes his way to the back of the room
claude steps up holds out his tray for cookie
excuse me i dont like it when the food touches each other so if you could just keep everything separate
disappointed claude turns to discover that the only seat left is next to ray
scowling he limps toward it
jangle legs eyes follow claude as he approaches the table
biscuit smacks him
eyes front mister
claude sits down and promptly goes to work scraping his burnt toast with his knife
the irritating sound slowly brings the entire room to dead silence
all eyes fall on claude
scratch scratch scratch
stepping up problem with the toast
its fine now
cookie glowers and takes a seat
stop aggravating people
just eat your food
as the room returns to normal claude starts polishing his fork with his shirttail
irritated ray shoots him a look
this fork is filthy
the fork is the least of your worries claude
undeterred claude breathes on his fork and polishes it some more
disgusted ray pushes aside his plate
whats your name
what are you in for willie
thats a long story
when he was years old he killed a son of a bitch with a claw hammer
they never proved that
what a second youve been in here since you were thirteen
what about you radio
bitch killed his sister with an axe
she was my half sister
shit i aint the son of a bitch who poisoned my own parents
protective they deserved it
what about you biscuit
you nearly skinned your poor old landlady alive
at least he didnt kill santa claus with his bare hands
you killed santa claus
scolding on christmas eve
he wasnt the santa claus he was just wearing the suit and ringing a bell
what did you guys do
the whole table waits expectantly for their reply
i kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night
must have been or twenty not counting women and children
it was a real bloodbath
all that screaming
pack of lies
dont listen to him
we didnt kill nobody
we were railroaded
and we gonna prove that
he just blocked it out
hes the one who did all the stabbing
hes capable of some heinous shit
thumbing down the table how bout him down there
at the end of the table goldmouth a hulking specimen snarls menacingly flashing a glittering set of teeth
they say he was born out back behind the shithouse
thats what they say
you all been here a long time
doesnt anybody ever escape from this place
they run but they never get too far
couple years back cookie made it clear to greenville
greenville that the nearest town
nodding its a two day walk if you dont get lost
take a mighty cagey country boy to navigate the woods and bayous between here and there
those dogs they got can sniff a skid mark in your underpants from a half mile off
alright well lets say you make it to greenville
whats there anyway
grandma dodis pork rib joint
thats where they nabbed him
didnt even get to have my peach cobbler
the most important thing they got in greenville is a train that heads up north
just then goldmouth stands up casting a shadow over claude
hey girl you gonna eat your corn bread
claude looks up considering his options
i want you to have it
wait up there claude
you give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know youll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails
maybe i oughta eat your corn bread
my corn bread
oh no my friend
i love corn bread
ray picks up his corn bread and takes a huge bite out of it rolling his eyes with enthusiasm
i thought my mama made good corn bread but this is really something special
ray looks at the faces around the room smiles broadly
goldmouth is getting embarrassed
who knew id have to come all the way down to this here prison deep in the asshole of the great state of mississippi to find such a tasty piece
of corn bread
the prisoners begin to laugh
rays got them now
and who knew that in this great corn bread making institution id come face to face with the biggest ugliest stinkiest ugliest gold mouthed negro in the entire world
now get out of my face before i lose my appetite
a punch sends ray sprawling in the dust
goldmouth looms over him
the incorrigibles form a circle around the combatants
poker face the camp bookie is taking all bets
how you like your corn bread now new york
goldmouth and ray square off
goldmouth swings ray ducks and counters with a swift jab to the gut
goldmouth just flashes a shiny grin and clobbers ray with a fist the size of a thanksgiving turkey
ray sinks to the dust
radio drops down near him
come on new york you can do better than that
get up and show him how they do it in harlem
ray shakes his head and staggers back to his feet
he circles the big man and gets in a couple of good shots much to the crowds approval
goldmouth shakes his head and wipes the blood from his nose
now hes mad
he grabs ray by the shirt and delivers a crushing blow
ray reels backward into cookies arms
i appreciate you going to all this trouble over my corn bread
i dont get a lot of compliments in my line of work
cookie shoves ray back into the ring for more punishment
claude emerges from the mess hall munching on a piece of corn bread
he squeezes in between poker face and willie
your pals getting the tar whipped out of him on your account
how many times i got to tell you
he aint my pal
besides he looks like he knows what hes doing
just then claude winces as goldmouth delivers a jaw crushing uppercut that knocks ray on his back
claude bristles under the incriminating looks coming at him from all directions
claude crouches down as ray rolls over on his stomach and pushes himself up onto all fours
his eyes are swollen shut his face covered with blood
hey ray i think you made your point whatever that is
maybe nows a good time to throw in the towel
you know what im saying
ray manages a smile and staggers to his feet
slurring shit goldmouth
back in new york i know bitches who hit harder than you
goldmouth pulls back his fist and lets it fly
ray hurtles through the crowd collapsing in the dust
willie steps in
the mans taken enough of a beating
lets get him inside
cookie radio and poker face raise ray to his feet
goldmouth slings him over his shoulder and carries him toward the bunkhouse
dazed ray catches claudes eye
got him good huh claude
he wont be bothering us anytime soon
a quick elbow jab from goldmouth and ray is out for good
disgusted with himself claude tosses whats left of the corn bread to the mangy dog who makes short work of it
wagging a finger shame shame thats your name
on sundays the mess hall also serves as a chapel
from a makeshift pulpit the blind reverend clay and his daughter lead the congregation of convicts in a rousing chorus of down by the riverside
the gospel music filters into the yard where the prisoners mingle with kinfolk
dillard hums along with the gospel music as she places a couple of freshly baked pies on the window sill to cool
the camera finds claude and daisy walking hand in hand toward a simple shack just beyond the gun line
this is the tonk house and dillard is the gate keeper
request permission to go to the tonk boss
dillard considers daisy
i dont see no wedding ring banks
conjugal visits are for married prisoners only
you think you could make an exception just this once boss
she came all the way down from new york
i dont need the baptists on my back but i suppose i could issue a temporary marriage license for a nominal fee
daisy gets the picture
she reaches into her purse and hands dillard a couple of dollars
i now pronounce you man and wife
calling to the shooter shack claude banks going to the tonk
claude takes daisys hand and leads her over the gun line
ray watches claude and daisy step into the tonk house
then he returns to a game of horseshoes tossing a ringer
nearby biscuit gives jangle leg a haircut
biscuit when youre done with jangle leg you think you could squeeze me in
thought youd never ask
biscuit needs some gravy
im talking about a haircut
cost you a pair of nylons
hey ray goldmouth dont believe me
aint it so they got trains up in new york city that run under the streets
theyre called subways
a nickel will take you from one end of manhattan to the other
helluva ride too
radio looks up from a vacuum tube receiver hes busy repairing
hey ray you ever been to the cotton club

its pretty sweet
but it dont hold a candle to the boom boom room
thats where the real action is
whats the boom boom room
thats my joint
the swinginest nightclub in town
you got your own nightclub
well not yet
its still in the planning stages
so it dont exist
just because its in my mind goldmouth dont mean it aint real
everything worth anything starts with a dream
hoppin bob calls to ray from the gun line
got yourself a visitor
ray turns to find his mother a handsome woman in a floral dress coming toward him
the incorrigibles elbow each other and repeat the name rayford as mama gibson envelops her son in a fleshy embrace smothering him with kisses
what are you doing here mama
i heard some things so i went to see spanky johnson
he told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here
what happened to your face
dont worry about that
hey fellas this here is my mama
these are some of my friends
thats willie theres poker face radio cookie goldmouth biscuit jangle leg
the motley crew gathers around nodding politely
goldmouth flashes a golden grin
willie gallantly doffs his cap
shame on rayford here for failing to mention that he had such a beautiful mama
mama manages a half hearted smile clutching her bag
nice to meet you all
how was your train ride
quite comfortable thank you

scuse me you got any batteries on you

biscuit sides up fingering her dress
thats a lovely dress
make it yourself
vaguely unsettled yeah
ray and his mama sit in the shade
this is a big surprise mama
i sure didnt expect to see you down here
a long uncomfortable beat
mamas lip starts to tremble
rayford i wanted so much more for you than this
dont cry mama
this place aint so bad as it looks
sure we work hard but theres plenty fresh air and sunshine
and you know something else ive taken to going to church regular
they got services every sunday right there in the mess hall
dont you lie to me rayford
composing herself you still have your daddys watch
ray shakes his head well this is all i can give you
i wish it was more
she puts some money in his hand
i cant take that mama
dont argue with me
you need it more than i do
i know how a little money can help in a place like this
reluctantly ray stashes the money in his pocket
i cant believe this
i always said id never end up like this
i thought id make something of myself do something with my life
you know be successful
have a big house a family
now im gonna end up just like daddy
dont say that rayford
dont ever say that
he gave up hope
thats where you gotta be different
they gave me life mama
i gave you life
and they cant take it away from you
youll get outta here someday
i believe that
you gotta believe it too
reclining on a straw mattress claude watches intently as daisy gets dressed
the rickety door reverberates with a loud pounding
off times up banks
we got a crowd gathering out here
claude leaps from the bed and slams his fist against the door
woman came all the way from new york goddamnit
well come out when were good and ready
daisy quickly buttons up her dress
did you go see my cousin maynard like i asked you in my letter
of course i did
he said hed file an appeal right away
you didnt tell me he was so good looking
yeah that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains
i hope he dont mess things up
he seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me
his offices take up an entire floor of that big new building on th street and he was using all these words i never heard before
he even offered me a job
a job huh
well thats nice real nice
you wont have to work long
ill be back soon enough
after i start work at first federal bank of manhattan ill be keeping you in style
everything will get back to normal again
thats a promise
daisy smiles weakly and looks away
she doesnt have much faith in this promise
listen claude maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend too
thinks about it no no
hes the reason im in here daisy
for all i know hes got a record a mile long
i got a better shot of getting out of here on my own
you tell maynard to think about me concentrate on me
sure claude whatever you say
the prisoners jump down from the cart and grab hammers and pick axes as hoppin bob keeps count with pebbles
we lost yesterday on accounta the rain
that means we gotta make up for it today so put your backs to it
you heard the boss
ray and claude jump down after willie
squinting at the sun looks like a scorcher
i bet the son of a bitch goes over a hundred and ten
ill take that action
the long line levels a road to a work tune being sung by jangle leg
dillard checks the thermometer on the truck degrees and rising
mopping his brow he starts down the line
the sun arcs overhead a blazing inferno
heat rises off the road
the men sweat profusely
taking it off here boss
echoes up and down the line
biscuit has his work cut out for him lugging a water bucket from man to man offering the ladle
the mercury hits degrees
a new guy lets his hammer slip from his fingers collapses in the dirt
radio nods to poker face who hands him a pack of cigs
man down boss
dillard uses his foot to roll the stricken man over
hes still alive
you two put him on the truck
ray and claude drop their tools grab the man by his arms and legs and lug him up to the road
once out of earshot ray whispers to claude
cookie drew me a map to greenville
you know what im saying
yeah i know what your saying
and im saying if you made it that far theyd be watching every train that pulls out of that station
thats why we wont take the train
cookie showed me where theres a farm house
they got a boat there
what do you know about boats
i bet you cant even swim
they reach the truck
with effort they swing the man back and forth and launch him into the back of the truck
what i know about boats is they take you to freedom
come on man
i think we can do this
why are you always talking about we
there is no we
there is a me there is a you
but there is no we between us
ray and claude continue their conversation as they lather up for a shave
you want out of this place dont you
dont tell me youre starting to like it here
no i dont like it here
theres nothing but ass
balls and ass
believe you me im getting out of here
what does that mean
im not gonna forget it
what does that mean
if youve got a plan i think i have a right to know about it
i told you my plan
getting a map from a chubby chef named cookie
dragging our asses through the swamps in search of some worm eaten boat
that aint a plan thats a vacation for two in the hole
when youve got a map to new york city you get back to me
scowling ray finishes up his shave
moonlight streams through the barred windows of the cage
exhausted from the days work each man stretches out painfully in his bunk
sure was hot out there today
still too hot to sleep
every bone in my body feel like a big son of a bitch dog got hold of it
i cant wait til sunday
whats so great about sunday
mondays right after it
restless radio rolls over
hey ray whats the name of that nightclub of yours
you mean the boom boom room
the boom boom room
sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running
you should have come by last night radio
you woulda had yourself some fun
what are you talking about ray
im talking about old satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint
you mean louis armstrong
hes a good friend of mine
drops by the club whenever hes in town
hey do we have to listen to this bullshit
im trying to get some sleep around here
shut up claude
echoes around the room
irritated claude thumps his pillow and turns his back on the room
yeah things were hot last night but youll never guess whos playing tonight
a high horn note sounds
close up biscuit all dolled up and flashing a million dollar smile
she begins to sing
a tisket a tasket
biscuit is up on a makeshift platform in the bunkhouse lipsyncing to ella fitzgerald
but its not the depressing bunkhouse anymore it has transformed into rays boom boom room
pull out slowly as ray decked out in a sleek tuxedo steps in front of the camera
he speaks into the camera as he walks
thats right fellas
catch any cab heading uptown
all the drivers know rays boom boom room
ray looks to his left sees goldmouth in the old bunkhouse
where am i at man
in nightclub cmon goldmouth somebodys gotta watch the front door
the camera pans off ray to goldmouth in a tuxedo at the front door of the nightclub with two lovely ladies
he waves to himself sitting on his bunk
himself waves back smiling like a kid in a candy store
willie is behind the bar serving drinks to three gorgeous hey ray i could get used to this
close on cookie sitting a table eating a huge porterhouse
the camera dollies around to find ray eating with him
ray my man this steak is like butter
made just for you cookie
how about some steak sauce
ray motions to a busboy clearing a table
how about some worchestershire sauce
and clean that damn table
willie laughing goldmouth laughing poker face in the bunk laughing
hey ray i know you got some gambling
ray at a craps table holding a pair of dice
he looks at poker face on his bunk
cmon poker face whats a club without some dice
the camera pulls back as ray throws the dice
a perfect seven
the camera pans up to poker face in a tux clutching a fistful of cash
let it ride
across the room jangle leg in a tux sits at the piano
radio also in a tux beats on the drums
biscuit sings the song smiling lovingly at her man
everyone is having a great time in rays boom boom room until
at the front door hoppin bob appears with five trusties dressed in police outfits
the incorrigibles scatter
hey ray looks like trouble
a hard white light from hoppin bobs flashlight shines directly into the camera
close on ray in his bed back in the old bunkhouse
the music stops abruptly
he shields his eyes from the harsh light
hoppin bob is looming over him
its back to reality
you dont shut up youre gonna spend the rest of the night in the hole gibson
that goes for the rest of you girls too
i dont want to hear another peep about no boom boom fucking room
a loud burst of flatulence cuts through the darkness
hoppin bob turns his flashlight on cookie
scowling hoppin bob steps out of the cage and locks the door behind him
the men slowly settle back in
whispering pretty good story ray
didnt much care for the ending though
lights out at camp
claudes playing pepper with radio jangle leg and poker face
the incorrigibles quickly gather around as he calls off names passing cards and letters through the crowd
dillard hands the letter to ray who glances at it before passing it back to claude
reading maynard banks esquire
attorney at law
that doesnt concern you
im sure it dont
claude rips open the letter
a profound disappointment settles over him as he reads the news from cousin maynard
bitterly he crumples up the letter and tosses it down
dillard strolls down the line with his rifle over his shoulder
under his watchful gaze hoes rise and fall
after he passes claude moves a little closer to ray
whats up ray
sure is hot today
think itll rain later
what do you want claude
what do i want
what makes you think i want something
my daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet
your daddy must have been a helluva guy a deep man a wise man
sure wish i could have met him cut the bullshit
what do you want claude
clearing his throat you still got that map
well if youre still thinking about booking it i want in
i think we can make it
did i hear you say we
as i recall youre the one who said there is no we
guess we got some bad news in that letter huh
look my cousin maynard is a lawyer
he filed an appeal on my behalf on your behalf
what happened to we
the appeal was denied
then daisy went and fell for maynard
theyre engaged to be married can you believe that
well lets just think about that for a moment
hes a successful lawyer up in new york city and youre down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business
eeny meeny miney maynard
come on man
dont shut me out
im telling you you and me that map we can go places
you know what claude
this whole time weve been down here youve done nothing but think about yourself acting like this whole thing is my fault
that plan with your cousin did that include me
a long beat
at least youre honest for once
so now you want to be my friend
well let me tell you something claude my shit dont stink banks
you got a lot to learn about friendship
does that mean im in
i dont think so claude
youd just slow me down
wed have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware
theres no way around it youre soft
whatd you say
i said youre soft
dont call me that
you know i hate it when you call me that
ray gets in claudes face and silently mouths the word soft
claude throws down his hoe and sinks his fist deep into rays gut
damn that felt good
i should have done that the first time i met you
ray touches the blood coming from his nose
eyes blazing he tackles claude dragging him to the ground
the two men roll around trying to strangle each other
hoppin bob hustles down the hill and drags ray off of claude
but claude comes back for more
hoppin bob finds himself in the middle of the fray
thats when the cavalry arrives
two trusties use their rifles to crack ray and claude over the backs of their heads sending them both down for the count
hoppin bob empties his canteen over their faces
they sputter back to consciousness
now you girls set aside your differences and get back to work or ill see to it well spend a night in the hole
we heard this shit before
ray and claude stagger to their feet and pick up their tools
hoppin bob and the trusties head back up the hill
ray starts to chuckle
what the fuck are you laughing about
ray opens his palm to reveal two pebbles
claude regards ray with new found respect
one by one the prisoners of camp climb into the mule carts under the watchful eye of hoppin bob
as each man passes he removes a pebble from his pocket
the last one in is willie
hoppin bobs pocket is now empty
all in boss
move it out
movin it out boss
dillard spurs his horse escorting the mule carts back to camp
as the carts fade into the distance ray and claude pop up from a roadside ditch and take off for a grove of trees in the opposite direction
running for all theyre worth ray and claude crash through the bramble
claude trips over a root and sprawls face first in the bushes
ray turns around and helps him to his feet
claude is still laughing giddily
he throws his arms around ray
you did it man
you got us out
next stop new york city
new yorks a long ways off
lets just keep moving okay
as ray and claude disappear into the woods
radios pulling in some jazz music out of new orleans
prisoners hit their bunks as the floorwalker does the nightly head count
he stops at claude and rays empty bunks glancing around puzzled
dillard smokes a cigarette on the swing
his wife steps out with a fresh bourbon and ice
suddenly sirens start to wail and emergency floodlights blaze to life at camp
hounds scramble down from the back of a truck and gather around the dog boy
he holds out a handful of soiled laundry and a dozen snouts sniff it thoroughly
nearby dillard gathers a dozen men with rifles and flashlights into a posse
he puts a cigarette in his mouth
hoppin bob lights it for him
trees rise ominously around ray and claude as they push through dense underbrush
i know these trees all look the same but im getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here
you sure you know where were going
the map is very clear
let me take a look at that map
claude considers it from various angles
you call this a map
what was cookie smoking when he drew this
cookie didnt draw it
you drew this
i knew you wouldnt come if i didnt have a map
that gripes my soul man
were out here in the middle of nowhere
there is shit nibbling at my balls
dont tell me you dont know where were going
ray shrugs and presses on
dumbfounded claude considers the map again then tears it to shreds
the braying of hounds echoes through the trees
hey wait up
ray and claude race through the underbrush
dillard and his men follow the dogs through the woods hot on the scent
ray and claude race up to a chain link fence
on the other side an old ford is parked on a dirt road
hearing the posse closing in behind them ray and claude fling themselves onto the fence
the posse is gaining ground
dillard takes two men off to the left sending the rest of the men straight ahead
claude clears the fence first and scrambles for the old ford
rays shirt snags on a piece of wire as he drops down from the fence
stuck he dangles helplessly a few feet off the ground
claude yanks open the door and jumps behind the wheel
two white teenagers bolt up in the backseat where they were necking
after a beat group scream
the half dressed teenagers dive from the car and scramble off down the road
claude twists the key in the ignition and the engine roars to life
come on ray time to go
claude sees ray caught up on the fence then hears the sounds of the approaching posse
if he floored it right now he might make it
but he cant just leave ray hanging there
claude runs up and grabs rays legs pulling for all hes worth
the shirt rips free sending ray and claude tumbling to the ground
they leap to their feet and turn toward the car running smack into the barrel of dillards shotgun
an old black prisoner delivers a frosty mint julep to superintendent abernathy who rocks slowly in his chair
at his feet his year old daughter mae rose is playing jacks
her long blonde hair makes her look like a little angel
they caught those two men who escaped last night
mae rose is pointing down the drive where dillard and a couple of trusties march ray and claude toward the house
they aint men mae rose
and nigger convicts to boot
can you say nigger

bound by leg irons and handcuffs ray and claude are deposited at the bottom of the stairs
here they are superintendent
we tracked em all the way to the tallahachie

im glad you new york boys could see some of our lovely countryside while youre down here
what do you say mae rose
how should we teach these two a lesson
mae rose considers their faces
ray and claude look like theyve been to hell and back
a night in the hole
better make it a week
dillard nods and turns ray and claude around
as they march back down the drive abernathy takes sip of his mint julep and affectionately pats mae rose on the head
the incorrigibles of camp gather at the gun line watching silently as dillard and a couple of trusties march ray and claude toward the hole
the trusties shove them each into a small dank cell and slam the doors behind them
dillard secures both doors with an iron bar
see you in a week boys
sequence omitted from original script
ray slumps to the floor propping his feet against the wall
i just want to say thanks for coming back for me
claude considers his bleak surroundings
its a small uncomfortable space not even big enough to lie down
just a tin bucket for a toilet
dont mention it
off hell youd probably be half way to new york by now
im serious man
dont mention it
the sun beats down on the tin roofs
the prisoners are gathered around a table laying out money
as usual poker face is keeping tabs
ill take claude to die on wednesday for fifty cents
wednesday for two bits
and dont forget you already owe me a steak
ill take claude for friday
thats my birthday
with an ear to his receiver radio slaps his money on the table
weatherman says a heat waves coming

willie tosses his money on the table

its a mighty long shot willie
nobody ever made it a week in the hole
not in august anyway
but willie leaves the money where it is
who else has some guts around here
poker face makes notations as the betting resumes
work goes on as usual for the prisoners of camp
trusties keep their eyes peeled for slackers
the brick shacks bake in the noonday sun
biscuit moves down the line offering the ladle to the men as they struggle under a crushing heat wave
superintendent abernathy strides up and gives the nod to dillard who unlocks the doors
huddled in their respective cells ray and claude shrink from the bright sunlight
then slowly and painfully they rise to their feet
in the background the incorrigibles gather at the gun line as word spreads that the fellows are still alive
abernathy glances at the crowd with annoyance
i dont think these boys have learned their lesson
lets give em another week for good measure
sure you want to do that sir
dont you ever question me sgt
when i give an order you jump to it or ill kick you and that first cousin you call a wife outta that pretty little house so fast itll make
your pin head spin

dillard slams the doors on ray and claude and clamps shut the padlocks
abernathy smiles at the incorrigibles who regard him with undisguised hatred
a somber poker face offers willie a wad of bills
well they made it a week
looks like you win willie
let it ride
a slot at the bottom of the door opens
a tin plate of mush slides through and the slot closes
slumped in the corner claude reaches for the food but a rat beats him to it scampering out of the shadows and leaping onto the dish
a commotion and wild screams come from claudes cell
ray leaps to his feet shouting through the wall
claude continues to stomp the rat
cant take it no more ray
gotta get the fuck outta here
claude pounds against the door raising a holy racket
we continue to cut back and forth between cells as needed
keep it together claude

claude continues shouting and pounding

dillard strides toward the hole shotgun in hand
he pauses to listen to the argument cocking an eyebrow in befuddlement

now shut up the games about to start
off hey man is babe ruth in the lineup today

dillard shakes his head shoulders his gun and heads back toward his house
abernathy gives the nod to dillard who unlocks the doors
two trusties drag ray and claude out of their cells
the men crowd around the windows
whats going on
are they alive or dead
dont look too good
theyre not moving
slowly claude opens his eyes squinting in the harsh light of day
summoning his strength he staggers to his feet
rays eyes blink open
claude holds out a hand and helps him stand up
they share a look
they made it
scowling sergeant dillard make sure these two are out in the fields first thing in the morning
abernathy turns on his heels
dillard considers the two tough guys standing before him

a decade has passed
a line of new prisoners stands before dillard now years older
camp is for incorrigibles so whatever youve done to get here believe me we are not impressed
you new men are probably noticing that we have no fences here at camp
we dont need no fences we have the gun line
it runs from shack to shack clear around the yard dillard pauses in front of a big country boy who cant be more than years old
the kid is bouncing a rubber ball
what the hell you think youre doing
the kid dont answer
an old guy steps forward
excuse me boss

something wrong with his head just cant get right boss

we dont need no fences at camp boss
we dont need no fences we have the gun line
it runs from shack to shack clear around the yard
you are now inside the gun line
ray and some of the fellas are playing poker
dillards voice drifts in through the open window
mouthing along if you step outside the gun line without my permission you will be shot
if you trip and fall over the gun line you will be shot
if you spit if you pee if you stick your ass out and take a dump over the gun line you will be shot
he lays down his cards and rakes in the pot
jangle leg pitches to radio who swings and misses
behind the plate goldmouth tosses the ball back to jangle leg
on the sideline ray teaches three card monte to cant get right
claude paces nearby
i try to teach em the finer points of the game share my wisdom but i dont know why i bother
they dont listen they sure dont learn
another pitch another strike
what youre dealing with here is a complete lack of talent
im sick of watching camp win the championship
every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick
this year i want that pig
radio knocks a grounder up the middle
alright radio there you go

cant get right shuffles to the plate
goldmouth hands him the bat
jangle legs gonna throw the ball nice and easy
you just go ahead and take a swing
jangle leg tosses the ball
cant get right swings and connects with a mighty crack
the incorrigibles crane their necks as the ball disappears into the sky
they turn to look at cant get right
ray gives claude a significant look then tosses another ball out to jangle leg on the mound
lets try that again
this time give it a little juice
jangle leg nods winds up and delivers a whistling fast ball
cant get right clobbers it
once again the incorrigibles track the departing projectile
cant get right smiles for the first time
the men of camp paint a fence along the drive leading up to the big house
i heard camp got themselves a son of a bitch used to pitch for the mud hens
that boy got a year for jay walking

just then a u
army jeep swerves past the men and parks in front of the mansion
tom burnette helps mae rose out of the car
the prisoners stare furtively at her long legs and curly blonde tresses
looks like little mae rose has grown up
mmm mm that girls got gams

that there is fresh water
next to them cant get right stares openly mesmerized by her beauty
ray nudges him

up at the mansion abernathy and his wife come out onto the porch all smiles
how was the honeymoon
am i gonna be a grandaddy soon
dont pay attention to the superintendent tom
youre going to stay for supper arent you
im shipping out this afternoon
the prisoners steal glances as mae rose kisses her new husband goodbye
she gives them quite a show raising her leg behind her just like betty grable
then tom climbs into the jeep and pulls away
mae rose takes a long glance at the prisoners
the men all look away except cant get right who stands there smiling innocently
mae rose gives him a little wink then turns her back and bounces up the steps
a plump pig roots about in a small pen
a sign dangles from a post first prize
the incorrigibles of camp limber up for the big game with the inmates of camp across the field
think you can handle something that big cookie
i handled your mama didnt i
dont yall worry
i got plans for that bad boy
aint none of him going to waste
beyond the fence a late model sedan rolls up
stan blocker in a straw hat and a rumpled suit climbs out and stretches his legs
irritated he smacks a mosquito and exchanges a few words with dillard
get over here
claude hustles over removing his hat
this is stan blocker
scout for the nigger leagues
negro leagues actually
ever hear of us
we get the games on the radio sometimes
we played down in jackson yesterday
heard a rumor youve got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton
you probably mean cant get right
thats him over there
cant get right
thats the kids name
can i talk to him
you can try but you wont get too far
why you interested
crawfords are always looking for new talent
maybe you didnt notice but this is a prison
there are ways around that
blocker winks at dillard then glances at the incorrigibles practicing in the field
goldmouth cookie poker face biscuit they dont exactly inspire confidence
nice looking squad
see you after the game
blocker takes a seat on the bench
the inmates of camp are in the field
our boys from camp cheer for cookie digging in at the plate
ray taunts the opposition from the third base line
the pitcher winds up and releases a fast ball
cookie swings and connects for a base hit up the middle
abernathy and mrs
dillard share a box of cracker jack
of course the superintendents hoping for a boy but personally id prefer a girl
whatever it is will be a little gift from heaven
look at the way she glows
mae rose sits next to them
she is six months pregnant
she removes her sunglasses and coyly bites a fingernail when she spots cant get right in the on deck circle
cant get right smiles shyly
sensing trouble claude ushers cant get right toward the plate massaging his shoulders
youre my boy just keep what little mind you have focused on the game
if you hit that ball the way i know you can you might just be our ticket off this farm
cant get right digs in
claude returns to the sidelines and appeals to the gods
the pitcher winds up and releases a fast ball
cant get right connects with that familiar crack
blocker stands up and watches the ball clear the fence and just keep going
with his team cheering him on cant get right trots around the bases
but hes still looking at mae rose
cookie slowly turns the pig on a spit over an open fire
the incorrigibles are savoring a victory feast
as always trusty guards keep an eye on things
off to the side blocker is laughing with ray and claude
he takes a hit off rays bottle of shine
its not his first either
mark my words within five years theres gonna be a colored man playing in the majors
come on the world hasnt changed that much
maybe not yet
but it will
and ill be out of a job
damn thats some tasty hooch
its amazing what ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses
so blocker what do you think of our boy
i think that boy could be the next josh gibson
im gonna talk to the front office about him you can bet on that
damn its getting late
we got a game in memphis tomorrow
blocker starts for his car parked just beyond the gun line
what about us
dont forget to mention us
were like his handlers
he cant function without us
ill put in a good word for you
youve done a good job with that boy
thanks for your hospitality
ray and claudes eyes gleam with hope as blockers car rumbles off down the road
inside a woman screams in agony
then the healthy cries of a new born baby
superintendent abernathy paces anxiously in front of a white curtain surrounding mae roses bed
suddenly mrs abernathy staggers out from behind the curtain with a stricken look on her face
she tries to speak but words fail her
her legs go wobbly and she faints dead away
the doctor steps from behind the curtain drawing it behind him
he checks mrs
shell be fine
she just had a bit of a shock
is mae rose okay
shes doing just fine
and the baby
vague hes a big one
its a boy
well lets get a look at him
abernathy pushes past the doctor and yanks open the curtain
mae rose is propped up in bed looking exhausted
well where is he
wheres my new grandson
the nurse turns around cradling the baby in her arms
abernathy gently pulls back the soft blanket
his eyes widen with horror upon discovering that the newest member of the abernathy family is black
cant get right bounces his rubber ball off the wall catching it on the rebound
ray passes around his latest batch of buck as the men discuss cant get rights professional prospects
the thump thump of the ball on the wall outside plays over
you really think theyll let him out of here just to play baseball
boys got god given talent
god may have given it but claude banks spotted it and nurtured it
i expect those pittsburgh crawdads to remember that
glancing out the window heads up here comes trouble
abernathy drives his sedan up to the bunkhouse
all of his worldly possessions are strapped to the roof
it appears that the abernathys are leaving town
in the back seat mae rose cradles her baby
her mother sits next to her
dillard steps out into the yard to confer with the superintendent then turns to address the inmates
alright listen up
i want every man lined up out here in the yard on the double
lets move it
you heard what the man said
abernathy holds his newborn grandson up next to rays face
scowling he moves a little further down the line scrutinizing the features of each man
he pauses in front of claude holds up the baby
abernathy stops in front goldmouth
holds up the baby
the possibility makes him shudder
he moves on to cant get right
his eyes narrow
i know it was somebody from this camp
i can feel it in my bones
disgusted abernathy hands the baby back to mae rose
then he turns walks back to cant get right and places a revolver against his head
do you know who the father of that little chocolated baby is
cant get right nods slowly
well then who is it
up and down the line the men brace themselves for the worst
cant get right just grins
enraged abernathy cocks the revolver
thats when ray steps forward
the babys mine boss
stunned abernathy lowers the gun and approaches ray
then claude steps forward
hes lying boss
im the father of that baby
confused abernathy looks back and forth between the two men
then willie steps forward
actually it was me boss
i know i may look old
any fool could see that babys mine boss
i beg to differ
that cute little rascal belongs to me
im the father
im the father boss
im the father
im the father
and so it goes down the line until every last man of camp has stepped forward to claim kinship with the superintendent
even hard ass dillard cant help cracking a smile
disgusted confused and thoroughly fed up abernathy jams the revolver into his belt and climbs into the car
as he guns the engine mae rose gazes out the back window smiling one last time at the father of her baby
cant get right smiles back
its visiting sunday and rays boom boom room is in full swing
sylvias girls are everywhere
down at the gunline dillard takes his cut from inmates lined up for their turn in the tonk
a five piece prison band is playing the blues
nearby willie is dispensing rays moonshine from a bunkhouse window
he raises a jar in a toast
to superintendent abernathy
may he have many more grandchildren
the incorrigibles erupt in boisterous agreement
claude grabs cant get right and shakes him
what i want to know is where
wasting your breath claude
he aint the type to kiss and tell
just then rev
clay and his daughter emerge from the mess hall and start across the yard
its a good thing the old man is blind because he wouldnt want to see how far his flock has strayed
the reverend inhales deeply as one of sylvias girls passes nearby
theres a sweet fragrance in the air today
the magnolias are blooming early this year daddy
blissed out incorrigibles enjoy a last dance as the band downshifts into a slow sultry number
in the midst of the dancers claude clings to sylvia
nearby jangle leg dances intimately with a young woman
up on the porch ray refreshes biscuits drink
biscuit has been crying and it shows
the liquor probably isnt helping
dont take it so hard biscuit
she dont mean nothin to him
hell with him
it aint that
he pulls some folded sheets of paper from his pocket passes them to ray
these are free papers
devastated what am i gonna do out there ray
i cant go home to my mama like this
ill get the strap for sure
come on biscuit this is good news
your mamas gonna break down in tears when you show up on her doorstep
poker face leans in
sotto ill give you three to one she gives him the strap
ray gives poker face a shove then turns back to biscuit
its a different world now
not for me it aint
well you cant stay here biscuit
this aint no life for a man
any one of these fellas would give their right arm to be in your shoes
i sure know i would
ray hands back the papers and heads off to dance with a pretty young woman lingering nearby
left alone biscuit polishes off his moonshine and checks his reflection in the bunkhouse window
no life on the inside no life on the outside
he crumples the discharge papers and drops them
then he steps down from the porch and walks calmly past the dancing prisoners toward the gun line
ray lifts his head off his dates shoulder
something about the way biscuit is walking suggests that he isnt going to stop
but its too late
biscuit crosses the gun line and keeps walking his eyes focused on the horizon
man over the line
the band stops playing the dancers grow still
dillard turns around and squints
goddamnit biscuit get back here
but biscuit isnt paying attention
he breaks into a run
dillard nods to hoppin bob who raises his rifle and draws a bead
but he cant pull the trigger
he lowers his gun
shots ring out from the shooter shacks
biscuit reels from the impact of the bullets and looks down sadly at the blood spreading across his ring arounds
prisoners silently gather at the gunline
jangle leg pushes his way through the crowd and crosses the gunline without hesitation
dillard indicates for the shooters to hold their fire
they train their rifles on jangle leg as he strides toward his fallen companion
jangle leg gently lifts biscuits lifeless body into his big arms and somberly carries him back toward the camp
the camera rises high overhead as the prisoners make way for jangle leg to cross back over the gunline
a dark mood hangs over the men
jangle leg sits stoically as radio fiddles with his receiver
nearby poker face and ray play a listless game of gin rummy
claude is thumbing distractedly through a dog eared copy of baseball digest
hey fellas i got chicago
but nobody can muster much enthusiasm for this news
radio shrugs and drops down on his bunk
just then cant get right walks past heading for the door
hes dressed in civilian clothes his bindle slung over his shoulder
hey cant get right where you going
why you dressed like that
cant get right holds out a piece of paper which ray scrutinizes
its a pardon from the governor
let me see that
the incorrigibles gather around for a glimpse at cant get rights ticket to freedom
whered you get this
cant get right nods out the window
stan blocker is waiting by his car
claude storms across the yard and stops at the gun line
ray is a few steps behind
yo blocker whats going on here
kids getting out
i got him a pardon
yeah but what about me and ray
i didnt see our names on that pardon
you said you were gonna put in a good word for us
i did claude
i mentioned you
i mentioned you both
but the fact is pardons dont come cheap
the kid can hit
what can you do
this hits claude hard
let it go claude
im not gonna let it go
the man needs to explain himself
look i am truly sorry about this
id like to help you
but you cant
at least the kids getting out
isnt this what you wanted
claude looks around as the incorrigibles begin to gather
hes on the spot
dillard approaches with cant get right
claude looks into the big kids eyes
of course it is
steeling himself to the reality of the situation claude gives cant get right a hug
you show them crawfords how to play ball
make em throw strikes
cant get right nods
he steps up to the gun line and looks at both shooter shacks
youre a free man now
cant get right steps across the gun line
blocker opens the car door for him
but before he climbs in cant get right reaches into his pocket and pulls out his rubber ball
with a smile he tosses it to claude who snatches it out of the air
dont worry well take good care of him
blocker tips his hat and climbs behind the wheel
claude and ray watch blockers car drive off under a red mississippi sunset
slowly the inmates drift back toward the bunkhouse until ray an claude are left alone at the gun line
one of the new kids said theyre farming those acres just north of the swamp
he said he saw a crop duster flying around the place
im not in the mood right now ray
he said they keep it parked out behind the barn
cant be that hard to fly a plane
lots of people do it
theyre called pilots
im serious ray
im not in the mood for one of your stupid fucked up plans right now
i dont see you coming up with any plans
getting mad my plan is on his way to pittsburgh right now
that congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us but we cant seem to do nothing for ourselves
dont you feel a little disgusted right now
i aint getting in no airplane with you
im finally wrapping my mind around the concept
they threw us in this shithole for life
dont you get it ray
were gonna die here
might as well head up to the cemetery pick a plot and start digging
suddenly enraged ray hauls off and knocks claude down with a solid right
surprised claude touches his bloody lip
my daddy died in prison
he gave up hope and hung himself
what youre talking about is the same damn thing
that aint how im going
maybe youre fooling yourself ray
maybe youre just a chip off the old block
take that back or we aint friends no more claude banks
heres a news flash ray
we never were friends
weve just been stuck together for years
its been nothing but bad luck since the moment i ran into you
every time i look at you i get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if id never bumped into ray gibson
a hard look comes to rays eyes as claude rises to his feet
better watch yourself claude before you say something you regret
the only thing i regret is the day i met you
well if thats the way it is
thats the way it is
then i have nothing left to say to you
ray walks away leaving claude to nurse his split lip
you never said nothing of value anyway
in his pittsburgh crawfords uniform cant get right lays into a fast ball sending it soaring into the bleachers
people dance in the street in time square marking the end of wwii
hoppin bob drops a package on rays bunk
ray rips off the brown paper to reveal a book so you want to learn to fly

sure enough theres the single engine crop duster parked right where he said it would be
claude and another inmate repair a hole in the bunkhouse roof
they dive for cover as rays crop duster swoops low overhead and dips out of sight beyond the trees
a puff of smoke rises into the sky
soot stained ray is marched to the hole and shoved inside

she got married last month
real nice guy too
they moved down to new orleans
claude takes this in staring off into space
she always said that if you were on the outside
but im not on the outside
im in here
i know shes sorry she wont be seeing you anymore
anyway she wanted me to take care of you
take care of me
you know go to the tonk or whatever
im too old for you
besides im not much in the mood
want me to come back some other time
shaking his head nice girl like you dont belong in a place like this
but if you talk to sylvia tell her old claude said congratulations
claude stands at the gun line staring across at the dillard house
dillard places a couple of pies on the windowsill to cool
whites only pies
suddenly he makes a break for the dillard house
man over the line
ray turns to see claude dashing across no mans land
shots ring out from the shooter shack kicking up dirt around claudes feet as he serpentines across the field
breathless claude makes it to the kitchen window and digs his hand into the golden brown crust shoving a sloppy fistful of pie into his mouth
more shots ring out
bullets ping all around him
grabbing the pie he darts around the side of the building out of range
back against the wall he drops down on his haunches snarfing pie like a hungry wolf
a case of empty coke bottles sits in the middle of the yard glinting in the hot sun
his face smeared with boysenberry claude finishes taking off his boots and socks and steps barefoot onto the bottles
as a pair of fur lined bedroom slippers boss
well see what those slippers feel like after say hours
and if you step down off them bottles if one toe so much as touches the dirt one of these boys is gonna shoot you dead
we need a special man for this job
he takes a trustys rifle and moves among the inmates who have gathered around
he stops when he gets to ray
how about it ray
ray glances at claude then back at dillard
ill make you trusty right now
if that pie eatin son of a bitch falls off those bottles and you have to shoot him ill see to it you get a pardon
hell ill personally escort you out the gate
dillard offers the rifle to ray who doesnt have to think too long
you dont want to give me a gun boss
im liable to use it on you
rays been given the same treatment as claude
barefoot balanced on coke bottles the two men stand a few feet apart facing each other
a trusty with a rifle keeps an eye on them
after years of silence the tension reaches the breaking point
youre a sucker
id have taken that deal
are you talking to me
id have knocked you off those bottles put a bullet in your ass and be half way to new york right now
after all these years of blissful silence i almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be
i hope you dont think i owe you anything
because i dont owe you a damn thing
i didnt do if for you anyway
i just aint no boot licking trusty thats all
the trusty tightens his grip on his rifle
hed love the opportunity
i was sorry to hear about your mama passing
that was five years ago
i know but since were talking i thought id mention it
were not talking youre talking and doing too damn much of it if you ask me
they stand in stony silence
then ray starts to laugh
a long low belly laugh
you sure looked funny running for those pies bullets flying all around you
bullets werent the problem
that pie was too hot
burned my tongue
the two men start to laugh
nearly a decades worth of laughter comes welling up out of them and they nearly lose their balance which only makes them laugh harder
a trusty bangs the rap iron
young prisoners pour from the bunkhouse and line up for breakfast
claude and ray bring up the rear the elder statesmen of the bunch
by a long shot
fourteen acres today and only hours of daylight
eat up and move it out
get your sorry asses over here
claude and ray step out of line and approach dillard
every morning i wake up praying that ray gibson and claude banks have died in their sleep and every morning you disappoint me
i stand before you a defeated man
try as i might i cant seem to break you
i swear if they dropped a nuclear bomb on this camp you and the cockroaches would be the only things left
but starting today at least i wont have to endure your presence any longer
youve got fifteen minutes to clear out your footlockers
youre both being reassigned to the superintendents mansion
and i for one will not miss you
ray and claude share a look
then ray embraces dillard who stoically endures the breach of his personal space
i always wanted to do that
sighing there is so much love inside of this man
up on the porch claude brings a tray of minted iced tea to superintendent wilkins who sets aside his bible and washes down a couple of pills
before going back inside claude cant resist taunting ray busy trimming a hedge out in the hot sun
oh yard boy these pansies could use some attention over here
perhaps some fertilizer would restore their exuberance
claude and ray beat the bulrushes with switches rustling a couple of pheasants from their hiding spot
as the birds take wing wilkins aims his shot gun and fires twice in rapid succession
both birds fall from the sky in a flutter of feathers
sequence omitted from original script
sequence omitted from original script
claude fills wilkins water glass as the superintendent takes a bite of lamb chop and winces in pain
damn dentures slipping again
everything falls apart when you grow old eh claude
time sure marches on
you know im fixing on retiring at the end of the summer gonna try to enjoy what few years i have left
what do you think of this place
its one of those new retirement communities down on the gulf
claude glances at a glossy brochure
from outside ray peers suspiciously through the dining room window as he hacks at a rose bush
ocean views palm trees two heated swimming pools and a golf course sounds a damn sight better than that infirmary across the way where im gonna end up
claude returns the brochure
i apologize claude
that was rude of me
thats alright boss
takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings
you been on the farm for quite a spell havent you
over forty years now
me and ray gibson out there
wilkins glances over at the window
ray ducks out of view
thats a long time for any crime even murder
its a hell of a lot longer when youre innocent
half the men in this prison swear theyre innocent
dont you think thats kinda funny
you have to forgive me if i dont laugh
claude pushes back into the kitchen leaving wilkins to think this one over
ray and claude are getting ready for bed
you and wilkins sure are getting chummy
you two planning on going steady or something
hes just a lonely old man
he likes to talk
hey im a lonely old man
i like to talk too
so why dont we start by talking about what kind of a plan youre working on
im not working on a plan
you cant fool me claude
i know you got something brewing
claude punches his pillow and turns off the light
ray hacks a rose bush down to the nub
from the garage comes the sound of an engine turning over
wilkins lincoln continental convertible lurches down the drive with claude at the wheel
he screeches to a halt inches from rays legs and climbs from the car
what the hell are you doing
dont touch that car
claude pulls out a hanky and buffs rays finger print off the hood
wilkins drivers got the flu so he asked me to fill in for him
you havent driven in years you aint even got a license
mans taking his life in his hands putting you behind the wheel
where you taking him
were picking up the new superintendent at the bus station
ray scowls as claude straightens his chauffeur uniform and heads up the path to the mansion
claude pulls up in front of the station steps out of the car and holds the door for wilkins who checks his watch
you know i trust you claude
ill be right back
wilkins heads into the station leaving claude alone with the continental
all around him are the sights sounds and smells of the free world
a woman rushes into the arms of a man as he climbs off a bus
across the street is grandma dodis pork rib joint where cookie never made it to the peach cobbler
a young brother with a boom box walks by
in the street kids crowd around the back of an ice cream truck
then claude catches his reflection in the car window and frowns
when did he get this old
unnerved he moves around to the back of the car and pops open the trunk
sitting up damn it was getting hot in there
what the hell are you doing in that trunk
you didnt think i was gonna let you escape alone did you
i aint escaping
were picking up the new super just like i told you
then youre lucky i came along
doesnt take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this
now help me out of this trunk
you aint getting out of that trunk
come on man im starting to cramp up here
ray struggles out of the trunk we have the chance right here right now i say we go
go where ray
back to new york for starters
and what will we do when we get there
im sixty five years old ray
so are you
what are we gonna do out here
get married have kids settle down
that boat sailed without us man
this boats gonna sail without you too
i dont care if i last one day out here
at least its one day of freedom
now gimme those keys
forget about that
you run if you want to but youre not taking this car
claude man im serious
give me those keys
i aint spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride
dont make me take them away from you
hey theres wilkins
ray looks claude clocks him
ray slumps back into the trunk
claude stuffs rays legs back into the trunk and slams the lid
whos driving now bitch
he looks up just as wilkins and the new superintendent exit the bus station
warren pikes hair has gone grey and hes years older but theres no mistaking the former sheriff of natchez county
he still bears a nasty scar on his cheek from a wound inflicted long ago
claudes pov pike appears as a young man in his sheriffs uniform striding slowly toward him
claude blinks and looks again
pike has returned to his old self as he and wilkins step up
dropping his bags there you go boy
oblivious pike climbs into the back seat
wilkins nods to claude
come on claude time to go
claude snaps to it grabbing the bags
he considers opening the trunk but decides to carry them around to the front seat with him
backs to the camera ray and claude urinate presumably off the porch
you sure it was him
some faces you just dont forget
warren pikes is one of em
i dont like it i dont like it one bit
we shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity
wed be half way to new york by now
wed be in the hole by now
hey man youre peeing on my shoe
simultaneously they shake and zip
claude bends down and picks up a bowl of gumbo placing it on a tray next to an identical one
wilkins pours a frosty drink and offers it to pike
i prefer bourbon
im sorry i dont keep any liquor in the house
well fortunately i carry my own
pike pulls a flask from his jacket and tilts it high
claude enters from the kitchen with the two steaming bowls of gumbo
huntings been pretty good on the farm the last few years
its one of the perks of the job
if youre interested tomorrow i could show you some of my favorite spots
you dont have to twist my arm
digging in say now that gumbo has quite a kick
thank you claude
thatll be all for tonight
pike nods coldly
claude steps back into the kitchen
if you dont mind my saying you seem mighty familiar with your house boy
i believe in treating the convicts with respect if thats what you mean
well isnt that progressive
if somebody deserves respect mr
pike they receive it from me convict or no convict
pike curls his lip with disdain before taking a healthy spoonful of gumbo
claude and ray beat the bullrushes with switches
amid a flutter of wings three pheasants take to the air
wilkins fires first knocking one out the sky
pike pulls off two rounds playing clean up
ray and claude dump their game bags into the back of a pickup truck
nearby pike drains his flask while wilkins scrapes mud off his boots
the breeze picks up clouds fill the sky
well thats a pretty good haul
what do you say mr
ready to call it a day
pike pulls a gold watch from his pocket and releases the face plate
a familiar mechanical tune floats on the gathering breeze
ray turns around slowly
his eyes fall on the watch in pikes hand
his daddys watch
in pikes hand
yeah its getting late
i could sure use a bath
thats a real nice watch you got there sir
fancy old thing even plays a little tune
yeah its special
they dont make em like this anymore
mind if i ask where you got it
why my wife gave it to me on our anniversary some years back
claude looks at the watch then at ray
must have been some time ago
maybe forty years
eyes narrowing something like that yes
she give you that scar too
pike thrusts the barrel of his gun up under rays chin
i oughta shoot you for that comment boy
like you shot winston hancock
wilkins turns to see pike holding ray at gunpoint
whats going on here
im afraid im gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners
uppity nigger to you
ray grabs the barrel of the shotgun and slams it into pikes face
pike rolls over and freezes staring down the barrel of his own gun now in rays hands
confused wilkins points his gun at ray
cool it ray
youre gonna get us in a lot of trouble
hes right gibson
put down the gun and well work this out
im gonna work this mans brains out the back of his head
shoot him wilkins
dont shoot sir
i can deal with this
cautiously ray buddy you dont want to shoot this white man
see you do that theyll kill you for sure
and its not that i like you or anything but ive kinda gotten used to having you around
hes got my daddys watch claude
i always knew whoever took that watch killed winston hancock
and that was you mr
dont listen to him wilkins
do you realize what your saying gibson
that watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me
it meant the world to me
goddamn it wilkins would you please just shoot the nigger
he shoots me i swear ill take you with me
i just want to hear you say it
is there any truth to what hes saying pike
what difference does it make
natchez was better off without winston hancock
who cares if a couple of no account bootleggers went to jail for his killing
at least the state of mississippi got years of cheap labor out of the deal
forty years of cheap labor
gimme that gun
claude grabs for the gun
no im gonna kill him no believe me im gonna kill him
claude yanks the gun free and points it right in pikes face
wilkins trains his gun on claude
but the moment passes
claude lowers the gun
bewildered wilkins does the same
i cant do it
thats because youre soft
gimme the gun
whatd you say
i said youre soft
dont call me soft i hate it when you call me that
ray mouths the word soft
claude clenches his jaw points the gun and pulls the trigger
pike smirks and pulls a small gun from his boot
but as he raises it blam
pike is hurled backward by a shotgun blast
shocked ray and claude look at wilkins his gun still smoking in his hands
after a significant beat ray reaches down and gingerly retrieves his daddys gold pocket watch
i believe this is mine
a gurney carrying pikes body is lifted into the back of a van by two county coroners
nearby a distraught wilkins tells his story to a couple of sheriffs deputies
i was drawing a bead on a bird when mr
pike just stepped into my line of fire
where were the two convicts when the shot was fired
they were busy loading up the truck
we got him back here as quick as possible but
i just feel terrible about this
ray and claude watch through the window as wilkins talks to the deputies
why dont he just tell em the truth
he knows nobody wants to hear the truth
one of the deputies pats wilkins sympathetically on the back
then he and his partner put away their notebooks and head for their vehicle
wilkins heads up the steps and into the house
well i think they bought it
one of the deputies belongs to my church
visibly shaken wilkins takes a seat wiping the sweat from his brow with a handkerchief
i realize theres no way
theres nothing i can say to make up for forty years
ill have charlotte prepare those pardon papers right away
wilkins winces and swallows a couple of pills from his box
claude mind helping me to the bathroom
giving him a hand sure boss
im not your boss
jake looks at willie expectantly
so ray and claude got their pardons right
smacking him no they didnt get their pardons you dumb shit
if theyd got their pardons way back then we wouldnt be burying them today would we
chewing on it oh right
well why didnt they get those pardons
old man wilkins never came out of that bathroom
died right there on the crapper
just like elvis
of course nobody believed ray and claude
that musta messed em up pretty bad
what happened to em after that willie
well lets see
after that they got old
we all got old
ray and claude now in their nineties sit under a tree in the courtyard listening to a yankees game on a transistor radio
nurse humphries was checking my prostate this morning
i got an erection
an erection huh
havent had one of those in a while
tell me about it
scared me at first
then before i could figure out what to do with it it was gone
imagine my disappointment
on the radio the announcer voice rises in pitch as the yankees score
ray and claude share a satisfied look
sure would like to see the house that ruth built one more time
well ruth shoulda built it a little better
damn things falling to pieces
gonna hurt somebody
what do you expect
its almost as old as we are
they oughta tear that shit down and ship them yankees cross the river to jersey
remember what that place looked like on a sunny spring day
more beautiful than any church i was ever in
two orderlies push a dead body past on a squeaking gurney
looks like old jonesy finally got his walking papers
ray tips his flask in a simple salute
over to the morgue and up the hill to the cemetery
never thought id admit it claude but you were right
course i was right
youre the one who said that boneyards the only way were getting out of here
were gonna join all the rest of em soon enough
jangle leg biscuit goldmouth poker face cookie radio yes sir pick a plot and start digging
ray closes his eyes and settles in for a nap
claude turns to watch jonesy squeaking away
something about what ray just said has given him an idea
oprah blares on the television
old convicts linger about in various states of repose and decay
a young orderly pops to the music on his walkman as he pushes a cart through the ward
over at a table ray and claude play poker with willie a shaky old junkie and two young gang bangers
the currency on the table isnt poker chips its pills of various sizes and colors
ill raise you
what the fuck are those
keeps your cholesterol down
i look like i give a shit about my cholesterol
gang banger takes a quick hit of cocaine from a bullet
he notices ray staring at him
you want a bump g
i wouldnt be putting that shit up my nose
that came in in somebodys ass
its like youre sniffin ass
maybe thats your thing but it aint mine
ray pushes his bet to the center of the table
the shaky junkie folds
willie tosses in some pills and turns to gang banger
looks like its up to you stinky ass sniffer
glaring gang banger flips a big pill into the pot
well thats a little rich for my blood
he tosses down his cards
the shaky junkie attempts to light a cigarette
the match slips from his trembling fingers and falls into his lap
damn fool gonna set this place on fire one of these days
gang banger folds
its back to ray
i got three stool softeners left
to gang banger that oughta be right up your alley
the remaining players match the pot
gang banger reveals his cards
ray lays down his cards and victoriously sweeps his winnings into a paper cup
across the room nurse humphries enters with a tray of snacks
she too is showing the years
who wants jell o
the magic word
the poker players join a stampede of oldsters in a clatter of canes walkers and artificial limbs
ray and claude are left alone at the table
hey where you going
we got money on the table here
claude glances around to ensure that hes not overheard
you know ray ive been chewing on what you said this afternoon
i think i got a plan
ray gives claude a long look
are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here
is that so hard to believe
dont tell me i dont want to hear it
its probably all fucked up anyway
you dont want to hear it you dont want to hear it
theres no shame in that
its too late for plans
never thought id hear ray gibson say that
hell with you then
youd only slow me down anyway
ray turns away as claude walks off
a doddering inmate stands nearby slurping on jell o
his robe hangs open
hey man cover that shit up
disgusted ray discards his own jell o
he pulls out his daddys pocket watch and checks the time
the little mechanical tune nags at him
he snaps the lid shut and considers the watch resting in the palm of his hand
sequence omitted from original script
the building is dark
but then through a first floor window we see the unmistakable orange glow of a fire
an alarm blares as the place fills with smoke
wearing a robe and slippers nurse humphries runs among the prisoners helping them out the door
coughing and disheveled ray emerges onto the lawn pushing willie in the wheelchair
as other prisoners evacuate the building ray looks around for claude but he doesnt see him
nurse humphries takes a quick head count
is everyone here
hey wheres claude
i dont see claude
stay calm ray
well find him
has anyone seen claude
he must still be in there
grimly ray starts toward the burning infirmary
nurse humphries holds him back
wait for the firemen
itll be too late
you cant go in there ray
youll never make it
im going in for him
hed do the same for me
ray shakes her off and runs up the steps disappearing into the burning building
ray dodges flames as he presses into the inferno
nurse humphries willie and the rest of the inmates watch grimly as flames engulf the building
nobody could survive this blaze
from the highway comes the siren wail of approaching fire engines
but its too late
sparks erupt into the night sky as the roof collapses
fire trucks pull away from the smoldering ruins
a local reporter interviews witnesses
investigators comb through the wreckage making notes
county coroners pull a couple of gurneys from the back of their van
superintendent bill burke is led through the destruction by a fire inspector
they approach the coroners as they finish zipping up two body bags
how did it start
probably old wires
the place was a tinderbox just waiting to go
i guess we should have torn this old building down a long time ago
gibson made it this far before he was probably overcome by smoke
from the look of things banks never even made it out of bed
burke watches solemnly as the coroners wheel the bodies past him
jake and leon shake their heads and look at the two fresh graves
man you really bummed me out
thats a terrible story
looking at jake nigger you crying
i just got something in my eye
its alright for a man to cry once in awhile
just dont make a habit of it
hey willie what was claudes plan anyway
nothing to it really
claude figured they could steal a couple of bodies from the morgue
they got a couple of crackers working there dont know their asses from their elbows
then they was gonna set fire to the infirmary and make it look like those bodies was them that got stuck inside
claude figured during the commotion it wouldnt be too hard to slip onto one of the fire trucks and hang tight until it rolled right on out of here in
the young inmates share a look then glance into the graves then look back at willie
what makes you think it didnt work
i never said it didnt work
leon and jake do the arithmetic
you can almost hear the gears grinding under the strain
you trying to tell us thats not ray and claude in those boxes
willie starts to chuckle and sets his electric wheel chair on auto pilot leaving the young inmates to guess at the truth
what do you think about that
i think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago
come on lets get this over with
they pick up their shovels and go back to work burying the caskets
the camera moves past a fireman hosing down the truck past another group of soot stained firemen eating breakfast and pauses in front of two lockers
a couple of firemen emerge from the showers wrapped in towels and open their lockers
they share a look
to the room alright which of you hambones took our clothes
scalpers sell tickets
vendors hawk souvenirs
fans stream up from the subway and through the gates
somebody is singing the star spangled banner
in the middle of a capacity crowd a vendor fixes two hot dogs and passes them to a kid at the end of an aisle
the kid passes them to the man next to him and so on down the line
the camera follows the hot dogs from face to face some old some young some black some white its new york city after all and finally the hot dogs arrive
in a pair of old calloused black hands
ray passes one of the dogs to claude
i cant eat this
why the hell not
i saw that hot dog guy in the bathroom urinating
he didnt wash his hands
ray and claude glance around confused as the wave rolls through their section of the bleachers
what the fuck
claude inspects his hot dog
just put some mustard on it and eat it
you didnt get ketchup
gimme that damn thing
ray snatches back the hot dog
what am i gonna eat
ray is suddenly young again
have my ice cream
claude takes the ice cream
he too is suddenly young again
they look at each other and share a laugh
hell of a day for a ballgame huh claude
hell of a day ray
yankees are on fire
claude pops the top on his ice cream
suddenly they are both old again
no this aint gonna work either
its half chocolate half vanilla
the camera begins to pull back
if you dont eat that ice cream right now im gonna strangle you until you are completely dead
you and what army
next thing youre gonna be complaining about the seats
well if you must know they could be closer
damn i shoulda let spanky johnson drown you in the river when i had the chance
pipe downs etc
from the people around them
glancing around i know youre not talking to me
im sorry hes on medication
the camera pulls back as the arguing continues just like the old days
