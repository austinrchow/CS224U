written by joel coen ethan coen june th white letters on a black screen receive with simplicity everything that happens to you
the flakes drift lazily down toward us
our angle looks straight up
now an angle looking steeply down the snow falls not quite dead away to collect on a foreground chimneypot and on the little shtetl street that lies maplike below us
it is night and quiet and the street is deserted except for one man who walks away from us his valenki squeaking in the fresh snow
he carries bundled branches on one shoulder and has a hatchet tucked into his belt
we cut down to street level
the man walks toward us bearded and bundled against the cold
smiling he mutters in yiddish the dialogue subtitled
what a marvel
what a marvel
as its door opens and the man enters
the man crosses to the stove with his bundle of wood
the voice continues can you help me with the ice
the man dumps the wood into a box by the stove as his wife enters with an ice pick
i expected you hours ago
you cant imagine what just happened
i was coming back on the lublin road when the wheel came off the cart thank heavens it was the way back and id already sold the geese
fifteen groshen but thats not the story
i was struggling to set the cart upright when a droshky approaches from the direction of lvov
how lucky you think that someone is out this late
yes very remarkable
but thats the least of it
he stops to help me we talk of this we talk of that it turns out this is someone you know
his wife stares at him as he beams
he takes the stare as a sign that she cant place the name
you know reb groshkover
pesel bunims uncle
the chacham from lodz who studied under the zohar reb in krakow
still she stares
then quietly god has cursed us
traitle groshkover has been dead for three years
laughter erupts from the man but as his wife continues to stare at him he strangles on it
wind whistles under the eaves
the man says quietly why do you say such a thing
i saw the man
i talked to him
you talked to a dybbuk
traitle groshkover died of typhus in pesel bunims house
pesel told me she sat shiva for him
they stare at each through a silence broken only by the sound of the quickening wind
a rap at the door
neither immediately responds
finally to her husband who is it
for some soup to warm himself
the wind moans
he helped me dora
we are looking in from the outside as it unlatches and creaks in opened by the husband in the foreground who has arranged his face into a strained look of
in the background the wife stares hollow eyed
you are welcome here
reverse on reb groshkover a short merry looking fellow with a bifurcated beard and a silk hat and spectacles
he gives a little squeal of delight
you are too kind velvel
he steps into the house and sees the wife staring at him
and you must be dora
so much i have heard of you
yes your cheeks are pink and your legs are stout
what a wife you have
the husband chuckles nervously
a ray of sun a ray of sun
my husband said he offered you soup
yes but i couldnt possibly eat this late or id have nightmares
no no no soup for me
i knew it
reb groshkover laughs
you think im fat enough already
he settles chuckling into his chair but dora remains sober no
a dybbuk doesnt eat
reb groshkover stares at her shocked
the wife returns the stare
the husband looks from wife to reb groshkover apprehensive
a heavy silence
reb groshkover bursts into pealing laughter
what a wife you have
he wipes away tears of merriment the husband relaxes even begins to smile
i assure you reb groshkover its nothing personal she heard a story you had died three years ago at pesel bunims house
this is why she think you are a dybbuk i of course do not believe in such things
i am a rational man
reb groshkover is still chuckling
oh my yes
and even if there were spirits certainly
he thumps his chest
i am not one of them
pesel always worried
your corpse was left unattended for many minutes when pesels father broke shiva and left the room it must have been then that the evil one she breaks off to
spit at the mention of the evil one
reb groshkover is terribly amused my corpse
what a wife you have
she steps forward to the reb who looks enquiringly up at her
they were preparing the body
pesels father shaved one check
as his eyes roll down to look at her hand she draws it across his smooth right cheek
then he left the room
he came back and shaved the other
she reaches across to the other cheek reb groshkovers eyes following her hand you were already gone
and drags her hand across
a bristly sound
reb groshkover laughs
i shaved hastily this morning and missed a bit by you this makes me a dybbuk
he appeals to the husband its true i was sick with typhus when i stayed with peselle but i recovered as you can plainly see and now i hugh
the wife steps back
reb groshkover looks slowly down at his own chest in which the wife has just planted an ice pick
reb groshkover stares at the ice pick
the wife stares
the husband stares
suddenly reb groshkover bursts out laughing what a wife you have
the husband can manage only a shocked whisper woman what have you done
reb groshkover again looks down at his chest which again moves him to laughter
he shakes his head
why would she do such a thing
he looks up
i ask you velvel as a rational man which of us is possessed
what do you say now about spirits
he is unharmed
on the contrary
i dont feel at all well
and indeed blood has begun to soak through his vest
he chuckles with less energy
one does a mitzvah and this is the thanks one gets
how can such a thing be
perhaps i will have some soup
i am feeling weak
he rises to his feet but totters
or perhaps i should go
he smiles weakly at dora
one knows when one isnt wanted
he walks unsteadily to the door opens it with some effort and staggers out into the moaning wind and snow to be swallowed by the night
the wife and husband stare at the door banging in the wind
we are ruined
tomorrow they will discover the body
all is lost
she walks to the door
blessed is the lord
good riddance to evil and shuts it against the wind
a drumbeat thumps in the black
music blares the jefferson airplane
grace slicks voice enters when the truth is found to be lies and all the hope inside you dies dont you want somebody to love
an image fades in slowly but even up full it is dim some kind of round dull white shape with a small black pinhole center
this white half globe is a plug set in a flesh toned field
the flesh tone glows translucently backlit
we are drifting toward the white plug and as we do so the music grows louder still
a pull back a reverse on the preceding push in from the cheap white plastic earpiece of a transistor radio
the jefferson airplane continues over the cut but becomes extremely compressed
the pull back reveals that the earpiece is lodged in someones ear and trails a white cord
we drift down the cord to find the radio at its other end
as we do so we hear live in the room many voices speaking a foreign language in unison
a classroom apparently
the radio is on a desktop but hidden from in front by the book held open before it
the book is written in non roman characters
we are in hebrew school
the boy who is listening to the transistor radio danny gopnik sits at a hinge topped desk in a cinderblock classroom whose rows of desks are occupied by other boys
and girls of about twelve years of age
it is dusk and the room is flourescent lit
at the front of the room a gray haired man in a worn suit and tie addresses the class
danny straightens one leg so that he may dig into a pocket
with an eye on the teacher to make sure he isnt being watched he eases something out a twenty dollar bill
mah zeh anakim
efsheh mashooach ba avodah
at the cut to the light the jefferson airplane music jumps up full
the light resolves into a multi flared image of a blinking eye
reverse the inside of a human ear
fleshy whorls finely veined a cavity receding to dark
objective on the doctors office the doctor is peering through a lightscope into the ear of an early middle aged man larry gopnik
the jefferson airplane music continues
close on hebrew characters being scribbled onto the blackboard as the teacher talks
the teacher talking
a bored child staring off
his point of view a blacktopped parking lot with a few orange school busses beyond it a marshy field and distant suburban bungalows
close on another child staring at something through drooping eyelids
his point of view very close on the face of a classroom clock
we hear its electrical hum
its red sweep second hand crawls around the dial very very slowly
danny gopnik hisses fagle
the teacher drones on writing on the blackboard
dannys eyes flit from the teacher to the student sitting kitty corner in front of him a husky youth with shaggy hair
he hasnt heard the prompt
the teacher turns from the blackboard and danny leans back eyes front folding the twenty up small behind his book
ahnee rotzeh lalechet habait hakisai
misaviv tamid anachnoo tamid
the clock watching child eyelids sinking is beginning to drool out of one side of his mouth
the light again flaring the lens
reverse looking into a pupil
objective the doctor looking through his scope into larrys eye
a bored child is excavating a bugger from his nose
the teacher turns back to the chalkboard to circle something
hamrah oomoh he interrupts himself briefly to make a couple of phlegm hawking sounds
he resumes hamrah oomoh meshiach oomshel zal
the doctor palpates larrys midriff digging his fingers into the hairy baggy flesh
doctors voice uh huh
well do some routine x rays
a young girl holds a hank of her bangs in front of her face separating out individual hairs to examine them for split ends
ahnoo ahnoo mah
ahnee to yodayah
the teacher begins to pace the desk aisles looking back and forth among the students
the bugger seeker having succesfully withdrawn a bugger carefully drapes it over the sharp end of his pencil to what end we cannot know
danny apprehensively eyeing the teacher slides the twenty into the transistor radios cover sleeve
a huge white rubberized cone pointed directly at us
we hear a rush of static and the doctors voice filtered through a talk back doctors voice hold still
wider larry is in his shorts lying on his back on an examining table covered by a sheet of tissue paper
the x ray cone is pointed at the middle of his body
there is a brief sci fi like machine hum
it clicks off
the clock watching students head is making descending bobs toward his chest
nefsheh shelach hamilamid eh
the teachers circuit of the classroom has taken him around behind danny
dannys book lies face down on the desk covering the radio but the white cord snakes out from under it up to his ear
the teacher yanks at the cord
the cord pops out of its jack and the jefferson airplane blares tinnily from beneath the book of torah stories
the teacher lifts the book to expose the jangling radio
outraged the teacher projects above the music mah zeh
some of the students are singing along a couple beat rhythm on their desks
anachnoo lo cam zeh bbait sefer
three other students join in a chorus shechet
the nodding students head droops ever lower
other students join in the chant the nodding students chin finally reaches and settles on his chest and he gives a long snorfling inhale of sleep
larry now fully clothed is seated across from the doctor
the doctor is looking at his file
he absently taps a cigarette out of a pack and lights up
he nods as he smokes looking at the file
well i sorry
he holds the pack toward larry
well youre in good health
howre judith and the kids
the doctor takes a long suck
daniel must be what
about to be bar mitzvah
well mazel tov
they grow up fast dont they
the portrait old in an ornate gilt frame is of a middle aged rabbi with a small neat mustache and round spectacles
he wears a tallis hood style and a phylactery box is strapped to his forehead
a plaque set into the frame identifies the man as rabbi minda
wider shows that the portrait hangs in the hebrew school principals office a white cinderblock room
it is quiet
the only sound is a deep electrical hum
just visible behind the principals desk upon which is a low stack of books and a name plate identifying the occupant as mar turchik is the top of a mans
head an old man with a few whispy white hairs where his yarmulka is not
danny seated opposite pushes up from his slouch to better see across the desk
we boom up to show more of the principal
he is short
he wears a white shirt and hoist up pants that come to just below his armpits
he has thick eyeglasses
he fiddles with the transistor radio muttering hmm
he experiments with different dials on the radio
danny nervously watches
you put the the old man holds up one hand
in hebrew um
the old man looks down at the little earpiece pinched between two fingers
he examines it as a superstitious native might a coca cola bottle
the source of the electrical hum a wall clock whose red sweep second hand crawls around the dial very very slowly
the reb continues to squint at the earpiece
he encourages yeah you the principals tone is harder in ivrit
this time his cold look holds until he is sure that the admonishment has registered
he looks back down at the earpiece
we hear the door open
the principal ignores it
an old woman walks slowly in with a teacup chattering on a saucer
she has thick eyeglasses
she wears thick flesh colored support hose
she takes slow short steps toward the desk
the principal is studying the radio
the old woman continues to take slow short steps toward him
the tableau looks like a performance art piece
she reaches the desk and sets the teacup down
she summons a couple of phlegm hawking rasps and turns to go
she takes slow short steps toward the door
the principal raises the earpiece experimentally toward his ear
close on his hairy wrinkled ear as his trembling fingers bring in the earpiece
the i f ngers push and wobble and tamp the earpiece into place hesitate and then do some more pushing and wobbling and tamping
the principal keeps danny fixed with a stare as his hand hesitantly drops from his ear ready to reach back up should the earpiece loosen
satisfied that neither the student nor the earpiece are about to make any sudden moves he looks down at the radio
he turns a dial
faintly and tinnily from the earpiece we hear the compressed jangle of rock music
the rabbi stares blankly listening
danny slumps looking warily at the rabbi
the rabbi continues to stare down at the radio
the compressed rock music jangles on
the rabbi is expressionless mouth slightly open listening
tableau anxious student earplugged spiritual leader
muffled from the outer office the hawking of phlegm
we are behind a man who writes equations on a chalkboard shoulder at work and hand quickly waggling
periodically he glances back giving us a fleeting look at his face it is larry gopnik
you following this
this part is exciting
students follow along bored
larry continues to write
so if thats that then we can do this right
is that right
isnt that right
and thats schrodingers paradox right
is the cat dead or is the cat not dead
larry is entering the physics department office
the departments secretary wheels her castored chair away from her typing
messages professor gopnik
he takes the three phone messages
thank you natalie
a korean graduate student who was been waiting on a straightbacked chair rises
he is flipping through the messages
absently so uh what can i do for you
the messages while you were out dick dutton of columbia record club regarding please call
while you were out sy ableman regarding lets talk
while you were out clive park regarding unjust test results
he crumples the last one
gopnik i believe the results of physics mid term were unjust
uh huh how so
i received an unsatisfactory grade
in fact f the failing grade
you failed the mid term
yes but this is not just
i was unaware to be examined on the mathematics
well you cant do physics without mathematics really can you
if i receive failing grade i lose my scholarship and feel shame
i understand the physics
i understand the dead cat
you understand the dead cat
clive nods gravely
you cant really understand the physics without understanding the math
the math tells how it really works
thats the real thing the stories i give you in class are just illustrative theyre like fables say to help give you a picture
an imperfect model
i mean even i dont understand the dead cat
the math is how it really works
clive shakes his head dubious
im sorry but i
what do you propose
no no i or perhaps i can take the mid term again
now i know it covers mathematics
well the other students wouldnt like that would they
if one student gets to retake the test til he gets a grade he likes
clive impassively considers this
larry wraps a hand wearily over his eyes
no im afraid hush hush
no thats just not workable
im afraid well just have to bite the bullet on this thing clive and very troubling
he goes to the door shaking his head as larry looks on in surprise
larry stares at the open door
the secretary outside her back to us types on
looks stupidly around his own office shakes his head
he picks up the phone message from sy ableman lets talk and dials
as he dials his other hand wanders over the papers on the desktop
there is a plain white envelope on the desk
larry picks it up as the phone rings through
a ring is clipped short and a warm basso baritone rumbles through the line phone voice sy ableman
hello sy larry gopnik
how are you my friend
larry picks idly at the envelope
good howve you been sy
inside the envelope a thick sheaf of one hundred dollar bills
shall we talk larry
larry reacts to the money
into phone what
i uh call back
he slams down the phone
he rushes out the door through the secretarial area and into the hallway and looks up toward the elevators
he looks at the stuffed envelope he still holds
he goes back to the departmental office
the secretary sits typing
she glances at him and as she goes back to her typing sy ableman just called
said he got disconnected
a hand enters to knock
mans voice out in a minute
sarah the sixteen year old girl who has just knocked rolls her eyes
i gotta wash my hair
im going out tonight
out in a minute
she stomps down the hall
judith a woman of early middle age is at the stove
w is uncle arthur always in the bathroom
he has to drain his sebacious cyst
you know that
will you set the table
why cant he do it in the basement
or go out in the garage
we are raking the exterior of an orange school bus as it rattles along
hebrew characters on the side identify it to some anyway
we are locked down on danny as the bus rattles like an old crate squeaking grinding gears belching exhaust
danny and the children around him vibrate and pitch about but from their lack of reaction seem used to it
they raise their voices to be heard over the engine noise and the various stress noises in the chassis and a transistor radio somewhere that plays jefferson airplane
i had twenty bucks in it too
inside the case
mark sallerson twenty bucks
i bought a lid from mike fagle
couple weeks ago
i still owed him twenty
mark sallerson he already gave you the pot
yeah but a couple weeks ago my funding got cut off
fagle said hed pound the crap out of me if i didnt pay up
howard altar what funding got cut off

another boy with thick glasses is ronnie nudell
ronnie nudell what happened

a hand enters to knock
uncle arthurs voice out in a minute
are you still in there
uncle arthur i uh
just a minute
ive gotta wash my hair
im going out tonight to the hole
uncle arthur okay
larry pulls into the driveway and gets out of the car
the purr of a lawn mower
his point of view gar brandt the next door neighbor is mowing his lawn
he has a buzz cut and is wearing a white t shirt
another noise competes with the lawn mower rattling squeaking gear grinding
the orange school bus with hebrew lettering pulls up across the street
its door opens with a pneumatic hiss to discharge a passenger
larry sits in
his wife and two children are already seated
there is one empty place
larry projects arthur
a muffled voice yeah
out in a minute
we should wait
are you kidding
they start eating
brandt keeps mowing part of our lawn
does that matter
is it important
its just odd
any news on your tenure
i think theyll give me tenure
well i dont know
these things arent you know
no i dont know
which is why i ask
mom how long is uncle arthur staying with us
ask your father
larry is stepping onto a hose as he unwheels it from the drum of a traveling sprinkler laying out an are to cover the back yard
intermittent thwacks from next door gar brandt and his son who also has a buzz cut and a white t shirt throw a baseball back and forth
gar brandt throws hard
the ball pops in the boys mitt
larry walks over to the boundary defined by the fresh mowing
he sights down it
gar brandt looks over his shoulder at larry looking
gar brandt is expressionless
he goes back to throwing
larry sits at the kitchen table a briefcase open on the chair next to him
blue books examination booklets are spread on the table in front of him
he reads occasionally making marginal scribbles grading
from off faint and dulled by intervening walls rock music somewhere in the house danny is listening to the jefferson airplane
the clink of teaspoon against china as larry stirs his tea
he looks up at a noise judy enters
did you talk to sy
still absent without looking up sy
thats right he called but i you didnt talk to him
no i you know the problems you and i have been having
sympathetic but still absent mm
well sy and i have become very close
this brings larrys head up
he focuses on judy puzzled
she elaborates in
short i think its time to start talking about a divorce
larry stares at her
a long beat
at length trying to digest sy ableman
this is not about sy
you mentioned sy
dont twist my words
we a divorce what have i done
i havent done anything what have i done
larry dont be a child
you havent done anything
i havent done anything
we havent done anything
and i im probably about to get tenure
nevertheless there have been problems
as you know
and things have changed
and then sy ableman
sy has come into my life
and now come into your what does that mean
you you you you barely know him
weve known the ablemans for fifteen years
yes but you you said we hadnt done anything
judy suddenly is stony i havent done anything
this is not some flashy fling
this is not about woopsy doopsy
larry stares at her
from down the hall a knock on a door
a muffled voice out in a minute
look i didnt know any other way of breaking it to you
except to tell you
and treat you like an adult
is that so wrong
larry does not seem to be listening
his eyes roam the room as he thinks
where do i sleep
judy narrows her eyes
arthurs on the couch
sy feels that we should esther is barely cold
esther died three years ago
and it was a loveless marriage
sy wants a gett
this derails the conversation
larry stares trying to pick up the thread
a ritual divorce
he says its very important
without a gett im an aguna
what are you talking about
she turns to go shaking her head peeved you always act so surprised
as she leaves i have begged you to see the rabbi
larry has fallen asleep at the kitchen table face down in a pile of blue books
cold blue light sweeps across him and he looks up
a short balding middle aged man in flannel pyjamas and an old flannel dressing gown stands in front of the open refrigerator holding an open jar of orange juice
he tips the jar back to drink his free hand holding a balled up towel to the back of his neck larry stares at him
larry enters the departmental office
his eyes are red rimmed and dark bagged
he has beard stubble
the departments secretary wheels her castored chair away from her typing
messages professor gopnik
he takes the two phone messages
larry looks at the messages while you were out dick dutton of columbia record club regarding ad attempt
while you were out sy ableman regarding lets have a good talk
a knock brings his look up
yes thanks for coming clive
clive park enters the office
have a seat
larry uses a key to open the top left desk drawer
he takes out the envelope
we had i think a good talk the other day but you left something that i didnt leave it
well you dont even know what i was going to say
i didnt leave anything
im not missing anything
i know where everything is
larry looks at him trying to formulate a thought
then clive where did this come from
he waves the envelope
this is here isnt it
clive looks at it gravely
that is there
this is not nothing this is something
that is something
what is it
you know what it is
you know what it is
and you know i cant keep it clive
of course sir
ill have to pass it on to professor finkle along with my suspicions about where it came from
actions have consequences
actions always have consequences
he pounds the desk for emphasis
in this office actions have consequences
not just physics
and we both know about your actions
i know about my actions
i can interpret clive
i know what you meant me to understand
meer sir my sir
larry cocks his head
meer sir my sir
careful enunciation mere
he gravely shakes his head
a hand lays it onto a slowly spinning vinyl record
through scratches and pops a solo tenor starts a mournful hebrew chant
close on the sleeve rabbi youssele rosenblatt chants your haftorah portion rabbi youssele wears a caftan and a felt hat and has sad eyes
they peer out from the dark beard that covers most of the rest of his face like owls eyes peering out of the woods
wider on danny in his bedroom evening
he lifts the tone arm on the portable turntable
he chants the passage
he drops the tone arm at the same place rabbi youssele chants the passage again
danny listens eyes narrowed
he lifts the tone arm and chants the passage again
he replays the passage again before he can lift the tone arm to echo it his door bursts open
rabbi youssele continues to chant
you little brat fucker
you snuck twenty bucks out of my drawer
you little brat
im telling dad
you gonna tell him youve been sneaking it out of his wallet
all right you know what im gonna do
you little brat
if you dont give it back
we hear the thunk of the front door opening
danny stands calling dad
larry is entering with his briefcase
as he stows it in the foyer closet dannys voice continues off dad you gotta fix the aerial
judith emerges from the kitchen
hello larry have you thought about a lawyer
danny emerges from the hall
were not getting channel four at all
to judith can we discuss it later
i cant get f troop
larry the children know
do you think this is some secret
do you think this is something were going to keep quiet
dad uncle arthur is in the bathroom again
and i m going to the hole at eight
she hits danny on the back of the head
whats going on
she keeps doing that
larry sits in a reclining chair in the living room head back listening to sidor belarsky on the hi fi
on top of the music is a hissing sucking sound
there is also the sound of a pencil busily scratching paper
we cut to its source uncle arthur sits scribbling into a spiral notebook his free hand holding the end of a length of surgical tubing against the back of his
the tube leads to a water pik like appliance on an end table next to him the source of the sucking sound
after a long beat of listening to the music larry speaks into space arthur
uncle arthur does not look up from his scribbling
uncle arthur yes
larry continues to stare at the ceiling
whatre you doing
still without looking up uncle arthur working on the mentaculus
any luck um looking for an apartment
uncle arthur no
the doorbell chimes
larry enters glances through the front doors head height window and freezes one hand arrested on the way to the doorknob
his point of view framed by the window yellowly lit by the stoop light a human head
a middle aged man a few years older than larry
a fleshy face with droopy hangdog features a five oclock shadow and sad harold bloom eyes
larry opens the door
sy entering thrusts out a hand
his voice vibrates with a warm sad empathy good to see you larry
he is a heavy set man wearing a short sleeved shirt that his belly tents out in front of him
in his left hand he holds a bottle of wine
ill get judith
no actually larry im here to see you if i might
he shakes his head
such a thing
such a thing
shall we go in the
he is leading him into the kitchen but sy oblivious to surroundings plows on with the conversation arresting both men in the narrow space between kitchen sink and stove and
invading larrys space
you know larry how we handle ourselves in this situation its so impawtant
judith told me that she broke the news to you
she said you were very adult
the respect she has for you
but the children larry
he shakes his head
the most impawtant
well i guess
and judith says theyre handling it so well
a tribute to you
do you drink wine
because this is an incredible bottle
this is not mogen david
this is a wine larry
you know sy open it let it breathe
letting it breathe so impawtant
thanks sy but im not i insist
no reason for discumfit
ill be uncumftable if you dont take it
these are signs and tokens larry
im just im not ungrateful im i just dont know a lot about wine and given our respective you know he is startled when sy abruptly hugs him
he finishes the hug off with a couple of thumps on the back
we are dutch on a slit of a view through a cracked open frosted window the hebrew school parking lot
the last couple of busses filled with students are rolling out of the lot
it is late afternoon
a reverse shows danny in a stall standing on a closed toilet angling his head to peer out the bathroom window opened at the top
the bathroom outside the stall ronnie nudell leans against a sink waiting sucking a long draw from a joint
danny emerges from the stall
ronnie nudell offers the joint
ronnie nudell want some of this fucker
the bathroom door cracks open in the foreground
danny peeks out
his point of view the empty hallway ending in a t with another hallway
a janitor crosses pushing a broom down the far hallway
his echoing footsteps recede
danny and ronny emerge from the bathroom
the photo portrait on the wall of mar turchiks office lit by late day sun
we hear a scraping sound
wider ronnie nudell looks over dannys shoulder as danny hunched at mar turchiks desk fishes the end of a bent hanger into the keyhole on the top left drawer
after a beat the hanger turns
they open the drawer
in it squirt guns marbles set to rolling by the opening of the drawer a comic book a playboy magazine a slingshot a small bundle of firecrackers
hands rifle the gewgaws no radio
ronnie nudell fuck
we are behind the two boys who sit side by side on the last pew staring at the front of the empty sanctuary
its stained glass windows further weaken the late afternoon light
in deference to the location the boys wear yarmulkas
a long hold on their still backs
at length some movement in dannys back his head dips and we hear him sucking on the joint
he holds it exhales and passes it wordlessly to ronnie nudell
we are pulling danny as he walks along the street eyes red rimmed still wearing his yarmulka
it is dusk
after a few beats of walking the front door of a house just behind danny opens
a husky shaggy haired youth emerges on the run
the sound has alerted danny
seeing mike fagle he too begins to run
he reaches up and grabs his yarmulka and clutches it in one of his pumping fists
pursued and pursuer both run wordlessly panting feet pounding
mike fagle is closing
but danny is already cutting across the brandts front yard approaching his own
he plunges into the house and slams the door
mike fagle draws up panting gazing hungrily at the house
lights are on inside
the house is a warm yellow citadel in the dusk
after a beat we hear faint and dulled the jefferson airplane
mike fagle slinks away
a shockingly blue sky with picture perfect clouds hanging in it
after a beat the top of an aluminum extension ladder swings in from the bottom of the frame and comes toward us
we cut to a side angle as the ladder clunk against a roof
it starts vibrating to the rhythmic clung of someone climbing
larrys head enters
he climbs onto the roof
he takes a couple steps away from the edge and stands tentatively making sure of his balance
he looks around
his point of view towards the front
an unfamiliarly high perspective on the street and the neighboring houses almost maplike
wind rhythmically gently waves the trees
larry gingerly walks up to the aerial at the peak of the roof
we are hearing a rhythmic popping noise
larry reaches the peak and straddles it
he looks down at the back yard
foreshortened gar brandt and mitch are playing catch in their back yard
with each toss the ball pops alternately in fathers mitt and sons
precariously balanced larry reaches out for the aerial
he tentatively touches it
he grasps it
he twists the aerial
something strange as it rotates the aerial creaks a high whine as pure as the hum sounded from the rim of a wineglass
faintly under the wineglass sound and clouded by static a high ringing tenor sings in an unfamiliar modality
larry drops his hand
inertia keeps the aerial rotating slowly til it dies the sound drifting away into the sybillant shushing of trees
larry reaches out again to turn the aerial
the same crystal hum
and now layering in the theme from f troop
larrys look travels his point of view pans slowly off the steep angle of father and son playing catch travels across his own backyard and brings in the white fence
that encloses the patio of the neighbor on the other side
gar off good toss mitch
on the enclosed patio a woman reclines on a lawn chaise of nylon bands woven over an aluminum frame
she is on her back eyes closed against the sun
she is naked
mitch off ow
larry reacts to the naked woman startled at first he moves to hide behind the peak of the roof
but as he realizes that the sun keeps the womans eyes closed he relaxes continu ing to stare
she is attractive
not young not old larrys age
after a still beat one of her hands gropes blindly to the side
it finds an ashtray on the table next to her and takes from it a pluming cigarette
the woman takes a puff and replaces it
mitch off ow
blue sky and white puffy clouds
the sound of a pencil scratching against paper
a pencil scratches equations into a lamplit spiral notebook
sidor belarsky comes in at the cut
so does the spluttering suck sound of uncle arthurs evacuator
wider on uncle arthur in his pyjamas propped up on the narrow fold out sofa writing with one hand as he holds the evacuator hose to his neck with the
squeezed into the living room next to the fold out sofa is a camp cot of plaid patterned nylon stretched over an aluminum frame
on the camp cot is larry lying half in half out of a rumpled sleeping bag
he stares at the ceiling a damp washcloth pressed against his forehead
his face is flaming red
arthur speaks absently as he scribbles will you read this
tell me what you think
larry continues to stare at the ceiling
uncle arthur glances up from the notebook focuses on larry
you shouldve worn a hat
the lights are out
uncle arthur lightly snores
larry still stares at the ceiling
he shifts his weight
the aluminum frame of the cot squeaks
he shifts again
larry fishes his watch from the jumble of clothes on the floor
larry in his underwear spoons ground coffee into the percolator
uncle arthur snores softly on in the other room
from outside a dull thunk
larry pulls back a curtain
next door gar brandt is going down the walk wearing camouflage togs and camo billed cap a rifle bag slung over his shoulder
he is carrying an ice chest its contents clicking and sloshing
the boy mitch also wearing camo clothes and cap and also with a rifle bag has just closed the front door
he now lets the screen door swing shut behind him and follows his father down the walk to the car in the driveway
the twitter of early morning birds
gars voice though not projected stands out in the pre dawn quiet lets see some hustle mitch
its top sheet densely covered by equations has a heading the mentaculus compiled by arthur gopnik after a beat larrys hand enters to turn the page
the second page is also densely covered with equations
this brings larrys look up from the mentaculus
we are in larrys office
standing in the office doorway is arlen finkle
arlen finkle larry i feel that as head of the tenure committee i should tell you this though it should be no cause for concern
you should not be at all worried
larry waits for more
arlen seems to need a prompt
arlen finkle i feel i should mention it even though we wont give this any weight at all in considering whether to grant you tenure so i repeat no cause
give what any weight
arlen finkle we have received some letters uh
denigrating you and well urging that we not grant you tenure
arlen finkle theyre anonymous
and so of course we dismiss them completely
what do they say
arlen finkle they make allegations not even allegations assertions but im not really
while we give them no credence larry im not supposed to deal in any specifics about the committees deliberations
i think youre saying these wont play any part in your deliberations
arlen finkle none at all
um so what are they
arlen finkle moral turpitude
you could say
can i ask are they are they idiomatic
arlen finkle i uh
the reason i ask i have a korean student south korean disgruntled south korean and i meant to talk to you about this actually he arlen finkle no
no the letters are competently even eloquently written
a native english speaker
no question about that
arlen finkle but i reiterate this larry no cause for concern
i only speak because i would have felt odd concealing it
yes okay thank you arlen
arlen finkle best to judith
larry answers with a wan smile
he looks down at the mentaculus
somewhere inside the school a bell rings
its doors swing open and children emerge
our angle is down a line of school busses each with the the same stenciled hebrew lettering waiting to ferry the children home
we are tracking toward the busses to steepen the rake
as children sort themselves out and climb into their respective vehicles the track brings the nearest bus into the fore ground
it noisily idles with its signature squeaks and stress sounds its low coughing engine ominously rumbling
children start climbing on
inside the bus now moving
engine noise bangs in louder and air roars in through open windows
we are on the driver a sallow man in a short sleeved white shirt with earlocks and a yarmulke
he pitches about stoically wrestling with the wheel and gear shift as the vehicle bucks
the pitching children
somewhere jefferson airplane plays
i gotta get my radio back
ronnie nudell maybe the fucker lodged it up his fucking asshole
i gotta get it back
or mike fagles gonna pound the crap out of me
ronnie nudell way up his asshole
and ill still have to get my sister the money back or shes gonna break four of my records
twenty bucks four records
howard altar how do you buy all those records
where do you get your funds
standing in his yard
his eyes are darkly pouched
he is staring at something it seems in distress
we hear a fluttering sound
his point of view stakes are set out in the brandts yard
red ribbon connecting them outlines a projection from the side of the house
the loose ends of the ribbon flutter in the breeze
engine noise brings larrys look around
a car is arriving
it is the brandts car oddly burdened
as it pulls into their driveway we see that there is a four point stag strapped to the hood its head lolling over the grille
gar and mitch get out of the car in their hunting fatigues
blood is smeared on gars shirt
go scrub up mitch
uh good afternoon
this brings gars look around
apparently he is unused to talking with his neighbor
there is a short beat before his response
in the background of his angle is the dead buck staring off through sightless eyes
is that a uh
he is indicating the staked area
gar looks around at it looks back at larry
gonna be a den
uh huh thats great
brandt gar barks at mitch who has lingered to listen to the grown ups i said scrub up mitch
the child quickly goes
isnt this a school day
took him out of school today
so he could hunt with his dad
gar stares at him with button eyes
small talk is not his thing
larry clears his throat
brandt thats just about at the property line there
i dont think were supposed to get within what ten property lines the poplar
even if it is youre just about over it measure
we hear two pairs of pounding footsteps coming up the street
i dont have to measure you can tell its
lines the poplar
its all angles
gar brandt turns and goes
larry turns reacting to the pounding footsteps
one of the two pairs belongs to danny who arrives slowing to a walk panting a bookbag over his shoulder
a half block back the pursuing boy also stops running
husky shaggy haired he watches scowling as danny goes up the walk to his house
larry addresses dannys retreating back whats going on
as larry enters
judith ofj yeah
judith ofj did you go to sieglestein schlutz
no i not yet
the thud of a car door outside
sarah heads for the front door pulling on a jacket
larry is surprised
where are you going
im going to the hole
at five oclock
he looks out the front door window
four girls of sarahs age are coming up the walk from the car
all have dark hair and big noses
were stopping at laurie kippersteins house so i can wash my hair
larry pulls open the door just as the doorbell rings
from the four dark girls hi mr
you cant wash it here
from somewhere in the house jefferson airplane starts
as she brushes past larry uncle arthurs in the bathroom
out in a minute
are you ready
were meeting sy at embers
both of us
i told you
larry has his arms pinned at his sides by hugging sy ableman
how are you
once sy releases larry all seat themselves at sys booth judith next to sy larry facing
thank you for coming larry
its so impawtant that we be able to discuss these things
im happy to come to embers sy but im thinking really maybe its best to leave these discussions to the lawyers
legal matters let the lawyers discuss
dont mix apples and oranges
ive beamed you to see the lawyer
teeth grit i told you im going monday
monday is timely
this isnt please
embers isnt the forum for legalities you are so right
no judith and i thought merely we should discuss the practicalities the living arrangements a situation that will conduce to the comfit of all the parties
this is an issue where no one is at odds
larry isnt sure where this is leading living arrangements
i think we all agree the children not being contaminated by the tension the most impawtant
we shouldnt put the kids in the middle of this larry
the kids arent im saying we
im not pointing fingers
no one is playing the blame game larry
i didnt say anyone was
well lets not play he said she said either
aw right well lets just step back and defuse the situation larry glares at sy
sy smiles at him sadly
he reaches over and rests a hand on larrys hand
i find sometimes if i count to ten
really to keep things on an even keel especially now leading up to dannys bar mitzvah a childs bar mitzvah larry
sy and i think its best if you move out of the house
it makes eminent sense
things cant continue as they move out
where would i go
well for instance the jolly roger is quite livable
not expensive and the rooms are eminently livable
this would allow you to visit the kids
theres convenience in its fava
theres a pool wouldnt it make more sense for you to move in with sy
judith and sy gape at him shocked
after a long beat larry youre jesting
larry there is much to accomplish before that can happen
sy is sadly shaking his head
larry larry larry
i think really the jolly roger is the appropriate coss of action
it has a pool
it sits in a large fishbowl filled with clear fluid
the brain alive pulses
leads connect it to various pieces of gear outside the fishbowl
brain and appurtenances sit on a dais of sorts dressed out with bunting
oddly the picture is scored with cantorial singing
the brain seems to be giving orders to people who wear imperfectly form fitting s uniforms of the future
after receiving their instructions the minions of the brain kowtow before it and leave
they are succeeded by two leather helmeted thugs big and heavy though lacking muscle definition who escort a resisting handsome man before the brain
the handsome man hands tied behind his back gazes defiantly up at the brain which in some fashion addresses him
we hear blows and voices over the cantorial music stop it
im getting it
im gonna get it
wider shows that the brain is on television which danny has muted while he plays the cantor youssele rosenblatt record and drills his torah portion
he and sarah are in a stand off hands tensed to either deliver or ward off blows
whats going on
she closes the door behind her
what was that
hows the haftorah coming
can you maybe use the hi fi
we hear the doorbell off
larry indicates the portable record player
can i borrow this
im taking some stuff
to you know the jolly rodger
on tv the handsome man shouts defiance at the brain
from off sarah projects dad
a middle aged korean man well groomed
he wears a nicely cut suit and a jeweled tie pin
he bangs his two knuckles together illustrating
he faces larry in the driveway
larrys car is half loaded with open boxes that are haphazardly stuffed with clothing and effects
larry is leaning against the hood arms folded gazing at the man unimpressed
a long beat
finally he bestirs himself
with all respect mr
park i dont think its that
it would be a culture clash if it were the custom in your land to bribe people for grades
so youre saying it is the custom
this is defamation
grounds for lawsuit
you let me get this straight youre threatening to sue me for defaming your son
but it would gar brandt is this man bothering you
gar brandt stands on the strip of lawn separating the two neighbors
he is giving mr
park a hard stare
is he bothering me
thank you mr
gar brandt not entirely convinced withdraws glaring at the korean
larry turns back to mr
see if it were defamation there would have to be someone i was defaming him to or i
all right i
lets keep it simple
i could pretend the money never appeared
thats not defaming anyone
and passing grade
or youll sue me
park for taking money
he did leave the money
park this is defamation
larry stares at him
it doesnt make sense
either he left the money or he didnt mr
you cant have it both ways
park why not
we hear sidor belarsky music
sidor belarskys singing crosses the cut
the tone arm of dannys portable record player rides on a spinning lp
wider shows larry grading bluebooks at a small formica table crowded into a corner of his motel room
it is a depressingly generic budget motel room of the mid sixties with cheaply paneled walls thin carpet formica night tables plastic lamps and twin beds with stained nubby bedspreads
the phone rings
fine mimi how are you
no its not that bad
its not that bad
theres a pool
arthur emerges from an alcove in the dim depth of the room that has a dressing room mirror and apparently connects to the bathroom
he has a hand towel pressed to the back of his neck
oh sure that sounds great
oh great then ill bring the beach families are crowded onto the small beach of a freshwater lake children cavorting adults lounging much sun few umbrellas
red floats connected by red nylon rope define a swimming area beyond it people dive from an anchored raft
splashing and childrens laughter slap off the surface of the lake
above the lake
the beach noise has some distance
it also has a faintly bizarre canyon echo
there is a present sybillant shushing of breeze in the trees
it is dark here with intense hot spots where sun sifts through the leaf cover
we are close on danny who sits very still leaning back against a tree trunk
after a very long beat he slowly exhales a small amount of smoke feathering out with his breath
gimme that fucker
danny passes the joint to ronnie nudell who sits opposite
on a woodless rise above the lake
each of the separate picnic areas consist of a redwood table and benches placed next to a firepit
here in the sun both larry and mel nudell a man slightly older than larry glisten with sweat
mel in the background bounces a bag of charcoal briquettes to spill some into the firepit
larry sits at the table in the foreground with mimi nudell who alone seems unaffected by the heat or by anything else in the physical environment
her pale gravely composed giacometti face is shaded by a large brimmed hat
almost a year and a half since touche ross let him go
hes very good with numbers
i think his his social skills have held him back
such a sweet man though
arthur has a good heart
and he never complains unlike me
sometimes i dont give him enough credit
he tried to tell me about this thing hes working on this um
he says its a uh
a probability map
of the universe
he asked if i could help him publish it
um it was a little hard for me to evaluate
does he go out socially at all
hes been going to the singles mixers at hillel house
well i should talk im not doing any better
how is judith
im the odd man out
sometimes these things just arent meant to be
and it can take a while before you feel what was always there for better or worse
i never felt it
it was a bolt from the blue
what does that mean
everything that i thought was one way turns out to be another
then its an opportunity to learn how things really are
im sorry i dont mean to sound glib
its not always easy deciphering what god is trying to tell you
but its not something you have to figure out all by your self
were jews we have that well of tradition to draw on to help us understand
when were puzzled we have all the stories that have been handed down from people who had the same problems
have you talked to rabbi nachtner
arthur is climbing the hill from the lake dripping wet
he projects boy
the air out here is magnificent
mimi looking at larry responds to his dark silence why not see him
mel nudell has finished spreading and lighting the coals
he now comes and sits next to mimi draping an arm over her shoulder
she strokes his hand still looking at larry
whats the rabbi gonna tell me
if i knew id be the rabbi
he looks at her glumly
life is beautiful larry
you just need help remembering how to enjoy it
she rests her head against mels shoulder
where are the kids
uncle arthur approaches swim trunks plastered to his thighs hair dripping one hand pressing his towel to the back of his neck
if somebody could bottle this air theyd make a million bucks
a white title comes up the first rabbi day
larry sits waiting
a door opens and he rises
oh rabbi scott
rabbi scott ginzler is the junior rabbi a man in his twenties
rabbi scott hello larry
i thought i was going to see rabbi nachtner
rabbi scott he was called away on an etz monim ruth brynns mother is in the hospital and she isnt doing well
rabbi nachtner asked me to cover for him come on in
a few minutes later
larry sits tensely hunched forward facing rabbi scott
and she wants a gett
a long silence
the hum of ventilation
at length rabbi scott a what
she wants a rabbi scott oh a gett
uh huh sure
i feel like the carpets been yanked out from under me
i dont know which end is up
im not even sure how to react im too confused
rabbi scott what reasons did she give
for the rupture
she didnt give reasons
just that oh you know things havent been going well
rabbi scott and is that true
i dont know
shes usually right about these things
rabbi scott mm hm
i feel so
rabbi scott yes i can see
i was hoping that
rabbi scott that he would
well with the benefit of his life experience
no rabbi scott chuckles
rabbi scott no of course not
i am the junior rabbi
and its true the point of view of somebody whos older and perhaps had similar problems might be more valid
and you should see the senior rabbi as well by all means
or even minda if you can get in hes quite busy
but maybe can i share something with you
because i too have had the feeling of losing track of hashem which is the problem here
i too have forgotten how to see him in the world
and when that happens you think well if i cant see him he isnt there any more hes gone
but thats not the case
you just need to remember how to see him
am i right
he rises and goes to the window
i mean the parking lot here
not much to see
it is a different angle on the same parking lot we saw from the hebrew school window
but if you imagine yourself a visitor somebody who isnt familiar with these
autos and such
somebody still with a capacity for wonder
someone with a fresh
thats what it is larry
rabbi scott because with the right perspective you can see hashem you know reaching into the world
he is in the world not just in shul
it souunds to me like youre looking at the world looking at your wife through tired eyes
it sounds like shes become a sort of
well shes shes seeing sy ableman
rabbi scott oh
shes theyre planning thats why they want the gett
rabbi scott oh
it was his idea
rabbi scott well they do need a gett to remarry in the faith
but this is life
for you too
you cant cut yourself off from the mystical or youll be youll remain completely lost
you have to see these things as expressions of gods will
you dont have to like it of course
the boss isnt always right but hes always the boss
rabbi scott ha ha ha
thats right things arent so bad
look at the parking lot larry
rabbi scott gazes out marveling
just look at that parking lot
our low angle looks across the lawn toward the front of the house
someones pounding footsteps approach and his feet enter just off the lens and he quickly recedes cropping in as he races up to the house danny
a beat later pursuing feet enter slowing for danny is already mounting the front stoop
dannys pursuer does not go deep enough to crop in but we might gather from the size eleven sneakers and the cuffed jeans that it is hulking mike fagle
we hear the front door being flung open and slammed shut and in the background foyer danny appears panting heavily
he gives one glance back toward the front door and then looks at his mother and sister eating soup in the foreground
his sister has a towel wrapped turbanlike around her head
she holds it with one hand to keep it from tipping off when she tilts her head down for the soup
still panting we eating already
im going to the hole
danny enters the kitchen and sits at the setting across from his sister
he picks up his spoon
some movement in sarahs body danny recoils from a kick
cut it out
whats going on
the siblings slurp soup neither answering
after a couple slurps isnt dad eating
hes at the jolly roger
in a small windowless conference room lined by bookshelves filled with law reference books larry rises to greet don milgram entering
how are you larry jesus i am so sorry to be seeing you under these circumstances
i always thought you and judy were rock solid
this is so terrible larry
this is devastating
well the way i look at it its an opportunity for me to really sit down and figure things out and and look at the world afresh instead of just
you know settling for the routine tired old way of looking at things
don milgram stares at him
i dont know
well legally i have to warn you its never easy for the husband
unless of course theres some question of the wife having violated the marriage contract
oh no nothing like that
shes planning to marry sy ableman but they sy ableman
yes but they esther is barely cold
she passed three years ago
well okay still this changes the complexion larry
not in the sense that
there hasnt been hanky panky
to my knowledge
im fairly certain this is not an issue
and in fact they uh judith wants a gett
don stares blankly at larry
larry clears his throat
a ritual divorce
so that they can remarry in the faith uh huh sure not really a legal matter
how are the children taking it
oh theyre very
on the other thing the neighbors property line ive asked solomon schlutz to take a look
theres very little having to do with real estate thatll get by sol
how do you i guess im a little worried how do you i have money pressures and our fee structure
we bill by the hour
dave sieglestein and solomon schlutz bill at a hundred and ten the associ ates me for instance bill at a secretary sticks her head in
a call for mr
you can take it here
oh eight oh nine
larry punches a button on a row of four on the conference room telephone
are you all right
are you all is everything f troop is fuzzy
f troop is still fuzzy
wide on the motel room dimly lit by weak sun starting to seep in around the curtain
larry sleeps in one of the twin beds uncle arthur snores in the other
uncle arthurs breath snags and tangles on a snorfling inhale and it wakes him gagging
he blinks sits up swings his legs out gazes blearily around the room
he rises stiffly and heads for the bathroom
the sound of uncle arthur urinating
larry looks blearily around
larry stiffly rises
he takes the two steps across the room to the formica desk on which are spread papers for his class
as we hear the sucking sound of the neck evacuator in the bathroom larry sweeps papers together and mechanically stuffs his briefcase
larry is driving hollow eyed to work
after a long beat of staring the ka ching of a bicycle bell
larrys eyes widen and his head swivels tracking as he overtakes and passes the bicyclist
a young asian man wearing a white traffic mask
larry looks at him in the rear view
he starts frantically pumping down his window shouting clive
you gonna send your mother next
you little bastard
i wanna see you
i wanna crash
he has rear ended someone
a blaring horn a quick second crash wrenching steel and spattering glass
he has been rear ended in turn
the ka ching of the bicycle
clive park cycles past without looking
larry enters the outer office hugging his paper stuffed briefcase to his chest
the secretary is just crooking the phone into her shoulder
oh professor gopnik
its dick dutton again
he sits in and picks up the phone
gopnik this is dick dutton from the columbia record club

he irritably punches a button on the bottom row of four

danny this is completely unacceptable
i cant afford to okay dad but you gotta come home
is it f troop
moms real upset
we can hear weeping semi hysterical from somewhere in the house
sarahs voice dad
does this mean i cant go to the hole tonight
does what mean what happened
sy ableman died in a car crash
dannys voice hey dad
so are you coming back home
can you fix the aerial
the weeping off grows louder and more hysterical
its still you know
after a beat in black a white title the second rabbi the title fades
we are close on larry
he sits hunched forward hands clasped in front of him staring at the floor sadly shaking his head
after a long beat it seems like shes asking an awful lot
but then i dont know
somebody has to pay for sys funeral
rabbi nachtner sitting opposite nods
rabbi nachtner uh huh
his own estate is in probate
but why does it have to be me
or is it wrong to complain
judy says it is
but im so strapped for cash right now paying for the jolly roger and i wrecked the car and dannys bar mitzvah
rabbi nachtner something like this theres never a good time
i dont know where it all leaves me
obviously its not going to go back like it was
rabbi nachtner mm
would you even want that larry
no i well yeah
or i dont know i guess the honest answer is i dont know
what was my life before
not what i thought it was
what does it all mean
what is hashem trying to tell me making me pay for sy ablemans funeral
rabbi nachtner mm
and did i tell you i had a car accident the same time sy had his
the same instant for all i know
is hashem telling me that sy ableman is me or we are all one or something
rabbi nachtner how does god speak to us its a good question
you know lee sussman
i think i yeah
rabbi nachtner did he ever tell you about the goys teeth
i what goy
rabbi nachtner so lee is at work one day you know he has the orthodontic practice there at texa tonka
rabbi nachtner right next to the gold eagle cleaners
we cut to it dominates a small suburban strip mall
rabbi nachtner continues in voice over as we cut to a smoked glass door that identifies leon sussman dds
rabbi nachtner hes making a plaster mold its for corrective bridge work in the mouth of one of his patients
a close shot of a mans mouth biting down on two horse shoe shaped troughs an upper and a lower that overflow an oozing white goo
hes a delivery dispatcher for the star and tribune with chronic mandicular deterioration
the grinding guitar solo from jefferson airplanes bear melt scores the narrative
the patient opens his mouth as a hand enters to grab the upper tray
the reverse shows dr
sussman a balding middle aged man dressed in the the high collared white smock of an oral surgeon
he carries the mold over to a drying table
kraus is twisted over the side of the chair spitting into the water swirled spit sink
well the mold dries and lee is examining it one day before fabricating an appliance
another day dr
sussman is sitting at his desk examining the lower mold
he notices something unusual
he notices something unusual
sussman reaches up for the loupe attached to his eyeglasses
there seems to be something engraved on the inside of the patients lower incisors
he flips down the loupe
his eyes are hugely magnified as he stares
sure enough its writing
his point of view tiny incised hebrew letters smli nn he confirms with a nod
rabbi nachtner this in a goys mouth larry
the rabbis narrative continues
rabbi nachtner tet resh nun lamed nun shin tsayin
what is that tiranu linoshets
is that what it says
or is it a name
its not krauss name
sussman flips the loupe away and looks off haunted
he checks the mold just to be sure
oh its there all right
a dental mirror is dipped into the horse shoe shaped hardened paste of the mold
it pans tiny letters that stand out in relief right side around in the mirror yw
rin sussman leans back thinking
he calls the goy back on the pretense of needing additional measurements for the appliance
close on kraus grinning as he shakes sussmans hand in the reception area
sussman gestures to invite kraus back to the examination room
sussman chats affecting nonchalance
in the examination room leaning over kraus in the chair the dentist is indeed chatting with seeming casualness
notice any other problems with your teeth
anything peculiar et cetera
sussman takes a dental mirror
visited any other dentist recently
he looks in kraus mouth with the mirror ym nn sussman frowns
there it is
he leans back
sussman goes home
can sussman eat
sussman sits at the kitchen table untouched food in front of him
his wife chats volubly while sussman stares into space
can sussman sleep
sussman is in bed pyjamas buttoned to the neck staring at the ceiling
what does it mean
is it a message for him for sussman
and if so from whom
does sussman know
sussman doesnt know
back in the dental office sussman pulls boxes containing other molds off the shelf
sussman looks at the molds of his other patients goy and jew alike seeking other messages
he finds none
he looks in his own mouth
close on sussman in front of a mirror straining to see the reflection of a reflection of the dental mirror he holds in his own mouth
his wifes mouth
sussmans wife lies asleep on her back her mouth open snoring softly
sussman in pyjamas but with his glasses on and loupe in place lies over her in bed supporting himself with one arm thrown across her body
he leans awkwardly in carefully lowering a dental mirror into his wifes open mouth
it is a singular event
the jefferson airplane guitar solo is heating up
but sussman is an educated man
not the worlds greatest sage maybe no rabbi minda but he knows a thing or two from the zohar and the caballah
he knows every hebrew letter has its numeric equivalent
sussman still in his pyjamas is sitting at the kitchen table scribbling on a tablet of lined paper
close on the paper the hebrew letters have been transcribed into their numeric nachtner continues in voice over seven digits a phone number maybe
sussman reaches for the phone
he hesitates a moment then dials
in a grocery store
a man in short sleeves reaches for the phone
rabbi nachtner its a red owl grocery store in bloomington
do you know a goy named kraus
the store manager is shaking his head
where have i called
the red owl
thanks so much
the manager puzzled hangs up
sussman thinks am i supposed to go to the red owl to receive a further sign
in the parking lot of the red owl sussman wearing a short brimmed fedora emerges from his car
it is an unremarkable grocery store in a suburban mall
its a red owl
inside sussman in his fedora gazes around
what have you
a service alley behind the store dumpsters wind blown garbage sussman looking
on the wall behind the store a stain
there is an old rather nondescript stain of some liquid splatted against the back wall and long since dribbled away
could be a nun sofit
or maybe not
the parking lot again sussman gets back in his car
sussman goes home
what does it mean
he has to find out if hes ever to sleep again
sussman again in pyjamas buttoned to the neck lies in his bed staring at the ceiling
he goes to see the rabbi nachtner
he comes in and sits right where youre sitting now
sussman is indeed sitting across from rabbi nachtner just where weve seen larry sitting
what does it mean rabbi
is it a sign from hashem
i sussman should be doing something to help this goy
the teeth dont say
i should know without asking
or maybe im supposed to help people generally lead a more righteous life
is the answer in cabalah
or is there even a question
tell me rabbi what can such a sign mean
nachtner not the narrating nachtner but the nachtner in the scene nods and considers
staring at the rabbi
he waits a good beat
he prompts so what did you tell him
the rabbi seems surprised by the question
rabbi nachtner sussman
rabbi nachtner is it
well isnt that why youre telling me
rabbi nachtner mm
nachtner says look
we are back in the scene narrated by voice over of the rabbi silently advising the fretful sussman
the teeth we dont know
a sign from hashem dont know
helping others couldnt hurt
larrys voice over question plays over sussman asking the same thing larry of but is that what it meant
tet resh nun lamed nun shin isayin was it help me
or a number
or was it rabbi nachtner off we cant know everything
sussman stares blankly at the rabbi
larry of it sounds like you dont know mthing
smiling equably at larry
he reacts to the ejaculation with a shrug
why even tell me the story
rabbi nachtner first i should tell you then i shouldnt
larry exasporated changes tack what happened to sussman
in his office
working on different patients as the rabbi resumes his voice over
rabbi nachtner what would happen
he went back to work
for a while he checked every patients teeth for new messages didnt see any in time he found hed stopped checking
sussman at home chats with his wife over dinner
these questions that are bothering you larry maybe theyre like a toothache
we feel them for a while then they go away
sussman lies in bed sleeping smiling an arm thrown across his wife
i dont want it to just go away
i want an answer
rabbi nachtner the answer
we all want the answer
but hashem doesnt owe us the answer larry
hashem doesnt owe us anything
the obligation runs the other way
why does he make us feel the questions if hes not gonna give us any answers
rabbi nachtner smiles at larry for a beat
rabbi nachtner he hasnt told me
larry rubs his face frustrated
a last question occurs to him and what happened to the goy
rabbi nachtners forebearing smile fades into puzzlement
rabbi nachtner the goy
the modern synagogue grafted onto a patch of prairie
an echoing voice rings out sy ableman was a serious man
in close up he gazes around weighing the effect of the words just delivered
after a long beat during which he seeks to establish eye contact with as much of his audience as possible rabbi nachtner sy ableman was a man devoted to his
wider shows rabbi nachtner up on the bema
he and the congregation face each other across a casket down at floor level
to torah study
larry sits among the congregants his gaze fixed on a point off
to his beloved wife esther until three years ago she passed
larrys point of view judy is visible from behind
she sits a few rows ahead looking grimly up at the rabbi
and to his duty as he saw it
where does such a man go
a tzadik who knows maybe even a lamid vovnik a man beloved by all a man who despised the frivolous
could such a serious man
the words echo
again the rabbi gazes around as if awaiting answer
we speak of lolam ha ba the world to come
not what the gentiles think of as afterlife
lolam ha ba
what is lolam ha ba
where is lolam ha ba
well it is not a geoaraphic place certainly
murmured chuckles from the congregation
nor is it the eretz zavat chalav oodvash the land flowing with milk and honey for we are not promised a personal reward a gold star a first class vip
lounge where we get milk and cookies to eternity
lolam ha ba
is in the bosom of abraham
lolam ba ba is in the soul of this community which nurtured sy ableman and to which sy ableman now returns
thats right he returns
because he still inspires us ableman returns
because his memory instructs us ableman returns
because his thoughts illuminate our days and ways sy ableman returns
the frivolous man may vanish without a ripple but sy ableman
sy ableman was a serious man
a sob echoes through the sanctuary
larry looks at judith who stifles further sobs with a handkerchief
as you know the mourners kaddish does not mention the dead
it praises hashem it praises what abides
and sy ableman whose spirit will continue to assist us in tikkun olam is with us even now a serious man who would say as we now say yiskadal vyiskadash
the congregation begins to chant along but it and judiths weeping are cut off by the front door to the gopnik home
larry still in his suit from shul and wearing a yarmulka opens the door
he recoils in surprise edged with fear
reverse two uniformed policemen
larry is momentarily dumb
inside the house we can see a corner of a card table set up in the living room with food laid out on it
sarah sits with her back to us head wrapped by a towel turban
arthur on the far side of the table his balding head domed by a yarmul ka half leans out so that he may sneak looks toward the men at the
door without totally revealing himself
from somewhere down the hall come judiths muffled sobs
are you arthur gopnik
cop i do you go by the name arthur gopnik
is that arthur gopnik
arthur ducks away
from inside the living room danny off dad
whats going on
can you tell me whats going on
were sitting shiva here
a religious observance
the cop standing behind gazes in over his partners shoulder
my wifes um
its a long story
tell gopnik you know arthur gopnik hes breaking the law
were not arresting him now but next time we will
gambling is against the law in this state
thats just the way it is
go back to your
a minute later
the family except for judith whose weeping continues off sits around the card table
a long beat
at length dad we get channel now but not channel
arthur how could you do that to this family
on sys its a victimless crime
that doesnt make it right
and you he won a lot of money dad
the mentaculus really works
larrys gaze swings onto his son
you knew about it
they must have finked me out
they knew i could just keep on winning so a couple weeks ago they blackballed me and now theyve what did you do with the money you won
arthur sneaks a look at danny
larry looks back and forth between them
whats going on
i didnt want it
danny said he could use it unfair
what have you been whats unfair is these guys saying i cant play in their card game
why give him the money
you know what he spends it on
knowing nod i know about the records
you think he buys records from mike fagle
movement in dannys body sarah recoils from a kick
whats going on
at least im not saving up for a nose job
nobody in this house is getting a nose job
you got that
struck by a thought he leaps up and bolts from the room
you werent excused
were still talking
what a brat
what was this card game arthur
some goys run a private game
we hear the tv go on down the hall and the theme from f troop
i think theyre italians
danny whats going on
larry enters to look down at dannys back
beyond him f troop flickers on the tv
were sitting shiva
larry sitting across from don has his head buried in his arms on the desktop
shes retained barney silver at tuchman marsh
this is a uh this is an aggressive firm larry
these are not pleasant people
judith is free of course to retain whoever she
i take it you dont talk to her
larry raises his head squinting against the light
i think she emptied our bank account
i tried to ask her about it very civilly
yeah yeah you better open an account in your name only put your paychecks in there from here on out
til we know where we stand
thats not um dishonest
you uh i hate to say this but i think shes also been sneaking cash out of my wallet
well yes this is definitely um adversarial
the first thing we are you all right
larry is wincing as he rubs a forearm under his shirtsleeve
just a sunburn
ive been spending a lot of time on the roof
he trails off and his head drops back down onto his arms
don gives him an appraising look
have you seen the rabbi
muffled again talked to nachtner
you should talk to minda
they told me minda doesnt do pastoral work any more
congratulates the bar mitzvah boy every week so forth
larry nods miserably
thats too bad
a very wise man minda
larry raises his head
larry youre fine
its a bump in the road
was nachtner helpful at all
larry gives a helpless shrug
don rolls his eyes
what did he tell you about the goys teeth
a knock on the door
don projects yeah
the door cracks open
a pipe edges in followed by a peeking face solomon schlutz
sol come on in
solomon schlutz is a large man in shirtsleeves and suspenders
he has the smooth impassive face of a sphynx with a pipe clenched in its teeth
he glides into the room a sheaf of files tucked under one arm
sol has been looking into the property line issues
solomon schlutz seats himself at the conference table and starts sorting and arranging the files into three piles
it seems that you do have a real problem with the original survey
but sol seems to think theres some kind of nifty way for us to well i havent heard it myself ill let sol map it out
solomon schlutz continues to arrange the files his eye occasionally lingering on a specific page
when at length he is finished he carefully justifies the edges of the closest pile takes the pipe out of his mouth gives larry a smile that seems to take
some effort and then taps the pipe in a large glass ashtray
he looks up again at larry this time shocked
his stunned look on larry holds for a long beat
larry returns a bewildered look
solomon schlutz staring at larry as if he were some sort of monster emits one barking solomon schlutz gah
his stare holds
solomon schlutzs face now passes from the red end of the spectrum to the purple
solomon schlutz nnnnff
the pipe clatters out of his hand
the hand grabs at his own shirt front
now his head pitches back
his backflung weight and twisting body send his chair tipping over one hand still clutching at his chest while the other frantically waves
he disappears behind the conference table and lands with a floor shaking thump
his writhing and gurgling remain audible
don milgram has risen to look down at his fallen colleague now he flings open the conference room door and bellows into the office an ambulance
somebody call an ambulance
a a secretary looks in and screams
solomon schlutz garf
larry walks into the outer office clutching his briefcase eyes wide shell shocked
the secretary is at her typewriter but holding the phone one hand covering its mouthpiece
columbia record club
larry sits in heavily behind his desk
he opens the top left desk drawer
he withdraws the bulging white envelope and opens its flap
he runs a finger over the wad of bills
he looks up startled
arlen finkle stands in the doorway
as you know the tenure committee meets are you all right
larry sits frozen with the white envelope in his hands
arlen finkle im sorry
i know youve hit a rough patch
he puts the envelope in the desk drawer and closes it
arlen finkle uh huh
as you know the tenure committee meets next wednesday to make its final determinations
if arlen i am not an evil man
arlen looks at him shocked
arlen finkle larry
of course not
i am not arlen finkle we dont make moral judgments
i went to the aster art once
i saw swedish reverie
arlen finkle its okay larry we dont need to know
the tenure it wasnt even erotic
although it was in a way
arlen finkle its all right larry
larry calms somewhat
arlen finkle okay
we uh we decide on wednesday so if theres anything you want to submit in support of your tenure application we should have it by then
what do you arlen finkle well
anything else youve done outside of the institution
any work that we might not be aware of
i havent done anything
arlen finkle uh huh
i havent published
arlen finkle uh huh
are you still getting those letters
arlen finkle uh huh
those anonymous arlen finkle yes i know
arlen finkle okay
doing nothing is not bad
we are close over larrys shoulder as he scribbles symbols onto the chalkboard
and that means
from which we derive
his glances back toward the class show that he is wearier baggier eyed more haggard than ever
there is also something odd about his posture
he writes smaller and smaller so as to finish before hitting the right edge of the chalkboard
which lets us
wider as he finishes and straightens up revealing that he has been stooping to write across the very bottom of the board
the equation covers every inch of the classroom wide three paneled chalkboard
larry is an off balance figure at the right edge of frame
reverse on the class staring
larry claps chalk dust from his hands
the uncertainty principle
it proves we cant ever really know
whats going on
a bell sounds
the students start to shake off their stupor and rise
larry projects over the wallah so it shouldnt bother you
not being able to figure anything out
although you will be responsible for this on the mid term
the thinning crowd gradually reveals one person still seated sy ableman
he wears a prayer shawl and yarmulka
larry does not seem surprised to see him
did you follow that
sy ableman of coss
except that i know whats going on
how do you explain
well it might be that in you know in lolam ha bah sy ableman excuse me
not the issue
in this world larry
he nods at the chalkboard
ill concede that its subtle
but at the end of the day is it convincing
well yes its convincing
its a proof
sy ableman excuse me larry
is the art of the possible
larrys brow furrows
i dont think so
the art of the possible thats
i cant remember
sy ableman im a serious man larry
i know that
so if ive got it wrong what do i sy ableman holds up one hand to silence him
sy ableman so simple larry
i know i want to see minda
i want to see minda
they told me that oonh
without our having seen him rise or cross the room sy ableman has body slammed larry into the chalkboard
now he grabs larry by the hair and whips his head against the equation
as he slams larrys head again and again the chalkboard chatters and the fringes on sys tallis dance
sy ableman see minda
i fucked your wife larry
i seriously fucked her
thats whats going on
very close on his eyes as they open
his head is on a pillow
dull early light
a hissing sound
larry looks blearily over
on the vanity table just outside the motel bathroom door sits uncle arthurs cyst evacuator
its waggling hose snakes into the cracked bathroom door as the machine hisses
on a doorpost
a hand enters to knock
a long beat
the person knocking gives up and his footsteps start to go away just as the door opens to reveal an attractive woman the sunbathing neighbor now wearing plaid shorts and
a buttoned white blouse
her point of view larry frozen halfway down the stoop head turned back up toward the door
i knocked and then thought you werent here
samskys voice is soft and breathy mrs
samsky it just took me a second to get to the door
i was out back
larry stands nodding
he seems to need prompting
samsky does can i help you
wanna come in
no i one hand on the door she steps back
samsky its cooler
i just wanted to let you know
he is entering
after the outside glare the house does indeed seem cooler
larry looks around the living room dim but neat
wavering light sifts through closed vertical blinds which drift and click over floor vented air conditioning
samsky closes the door shutting out all sound from outside
ive noticed that mr
samsky isnt around and i mrs
samsky he travels
yeah i never seem to see him so i thought i should let you know since youre somewhat new here if you ever have whatever chores that youd um or
just help with something ive decided to help others you know in a neighborly way
she gazes at him with the least hint of a smile and waits for the speech to dribble away to silence
in the ensuing beat quiet except for the clicking of the blinds she is perfectly still
finally only her mouth moves mrs
samsky how thoughtful
larry shrugs off the compliment
oh its nothing
its just good to know your neighbors
and to help
although i dont care much for my neighbors on the other side i must say
samsky lets another smiling silence pass before responding
samsky goys arent they
very much so
maybe its not fair to judge i have to admit i mrs
samsky wont you sit down
samsky iced tea
i have some
she is already turning to the kitchen
he watches her and reacts to the backs of her thighs
the flesh retains the broad cross hatch of her lawn chair
she disappears into the kitchen but calls out mrs
samsky i dont see you around much either
actually i havent been home a lot recently i uh my wife and i are uh well shes got me staying at the jolly roger the little motel there on
samsky is reentering with two tall glasses of iced tea beaded with moisture
the click of the ice cubes joins the clicking of the blinds
samsky youre in the doghouse huh
she hands him a glass as she sits on the couch next to him not invasively close one bare leg folded onto the couch the other draped over it
yeah thats an understatement i guess i thank you i mrs
samsky do you take advantage of the new freedoms
larry stares at her
samsky gazes back
her look displays equanimity his not
what do you mean
her look holds for one more beat and then she swivels and opens the drawer of an end table
she turns back with a joint
samsky its something i do
she lights it
samsky mm hmm
she hands the joint over
youll find youll need the iced tea
larry handles the bitty cigarette with trepidation
some minutes later
they drift and click in the air blown from the floor vents
larry stares at them
after a long beat maybe rabbi scott was right
samsky whos rabbi scott
the junior rabbi
samsky the junior rabbi
another long beat
neither person feels compelled to speak as the blinds click
the joint makes another trip back and forth
what did he say
he spoke of
all my problems are just
he trails off listening
is that a siren
some people get a little paranoid when they
that is a siren
the samskys door opens and larry stumbles out
the police car has stopped in front of his own house next door lights still flashing
two cops are going up the walk with uncle arthur between them in handcuffs
larry stunned walks woodenly toward his house
neither the cops nor uncle arthur has heard
they have rung the doorbell and now disappear inside
larry projects louder and starts to sprint
samsky has emerged from her house behind
larry takes the stoop steps two at a time
his door stands open and the theme from f troop issues from within
just inside the two policeman stand with their backs to us and handcuffed uncle arthur in between
the three men face danny who addresses them projecting over the music from the tv
he sleeps on the couch
this is crazy
this brings the cops look around
uncle arthur also turns shamefaced to larry
does this man live here
i didnt know what to tell them
they asked for my address
its just mathematics
you cant arrest a man for mathematics
i didnt know whether to say i lived here or at the jolly roger
you know this man
i figured this would sound more
i dont know
samsky appears behind larry on the stoop
dad why is uncle arthur in handcuffs
its all a mistake
i mean not a mistake a a hello mrs
a miscarriage does this man live here
he sleeps on the couch
what did he do
i didnt do anything
it folds out
dad sleeps on a cot
you cant just sir we picked this man up at the north dakota
larry is brought up short
the north dakota
but i didnt do anything
dad whats the north dakota
the north dakota
we hold on larrys shocked reaction as we hear danny off whats sodomy dad
he wears a black armband
he sits thinking bouncing steepled fingers against his nose
what does arthur say
he says he didnt do anything
he just went in for a drink
does arthur drink
he says he was confused
the north dakota
youll need a criminal attorney
whos ron meshbesher
is he good
ron is very good
larrys gaze wanders
he becomes wistful
i dont understand
he goes to mixers at the hillel house
i would call ron meshbesher
is he expensive
ron is not cheap
don focuses on larry
cheerful change of subject dannys bar mitzvah is
itll be okay
try to relax larry
try to relax
larry is making strenuous love to mrs
samsky so good
she rolls on top of larry to straddle him and still humping she lights a mentholated cigarette
oh my god mrs
beyond her head larry can see the low cottage cheese ceiling of the bedroom
outside we can hear gar brandt mowing the lawn
suddenly we hear muffled laughter and the front door opening
he hisses who is it
footsteps are approaching along the hall
samsky doesnt react she looks calmly down at larry even as the bedroom door opens behind her and clive park walks in wearing a traffic mask
larry is mortified clive please
samsky blows smoke into larrys eyes
the screen goes black
close on larry as he opens his eyes
a shadow falls across his face
his point of view a wooden plank is just being slid into place over his head
the bang of hammer on nailhead
in the black sy ablemans voice nailing it down is so impawtant
we hear the chanting of kaddish and the sound of dirt hitting the top of the coffin
it drums a steady rhythm
grace slicks voice enters somebody to love
in a break in the vocals right before the chorus mrs
samskys voice its something we do
on the chorus downbeat a crescent moon pops into the black
gar brandt traverses the sky pushing his lawn mower
a cow flies the opposite way
sy able man walks across the sky dressed like a shtetl elder a bindlestick over one shoulder
larry bolts upright in bed
uncle arthur is snoring in the tatty motel rooms other bed
a title burns in he stands looking down in low shot
above him is cheap johnson armstrong dropped ceiling
i need help
ive already talked to the other rabbis
reverse shows an elderly eastern european woman seated behind a desk looking up at i wont take much of his time
i need help
i need minda
its not about dannys bar mitzvah
my boy danny
this coming shabbas
very joyous event
thats all fine
its its more about myself ive
ive had quite a bit of tsuris lately
you name it
this is not a frivolous request
this is a serious im a serious im uh ive tried to be a serious man
you know tried to do right be a member of the community raise the raise the danny sarah they both go to school hebrew school a good breakfast
well danny goes to hebrew school sarah doesnt have time she mostly
washes her hair
apparently there are several steps involved
but you dont have to tell minda that
just tell him i need help
i need help
he lapses into silence staring at the secretary
she stares inscrutably back
after a moment she rises goes to the door behind her opens it shuffles into the dimness of an inner office
larry cranes to see past her
her own body and the dimness interfere with a good view of the figure hunched behind the desk
the man is old and bent
his desktop is empty
murmured voices in hebrew
a clock ticks in the outer office
larry looks around waiting
mysterious judaica adorns the outer office
the old woman is shuffling back
she closes the door on the motionless rabbi and sits down heavily behind her own desk
the rabbi is busy
he didnt look busy
as she starts shuffling papers hes thinking
sidor belarsky comes in at the cut
we are booming down on larry asleep in bed
we hear weeping soft suppressed
he opens his eyes
after a groggy beat he reacts to the weeping
he looks over
arthur is a dim mound on the next bed
his weeping continues
for no reason larry continues to keep his voice to a whisper arthur
itll be okay
well get ron meshbesher
itll be okay shockingy loud the scream is hard to interpret
arthur flings off his bedclothes
he leaps from the bed and runs to the door
in boxer shorts and undershirt he flings the door open and runs out of the room
larry leaps from his bed also in his underwear
he goes to the door but pauses peering cautiously outside
satisfied that the courtyard is deserted he plunges into it
the courtyard parking lot is hardlit by ghastly mercury vapor lights
the pool surrounded by chain link fence has been drained
its white concrete interior is cracked and weedy
uncle arthur is hunched weeping in a corner of the pool enclosure
he opens the creaking gate and scurries over to arthur
youve got to pull yourself together
arthur is suddenly angry
his voice bounces off the concrete its all shit larry
its all shit
dont use that word
its all fucking shit
look at everything hashem has given you
and what do i get
i get fucking shit
what do i have
i live at the jolly roger
youve got a family
youve got a job
hashem hasnt given me bupkes
its not fair to blame hashem arthur
sometimes please calm down sometimes you have to help your self
dont blame me
hashem hasnt given me shit
now i cant even play cards
he starts weeping again
larry looks around
this isnt the right forum
not by the pool
larry and arthur are driving
we are looking at the two of them square through a windshield in which towering conifers stream by in reflection
it seems to be a glorious day
is this it
both men peer out
i think so
he indicates the road ahead
the old fashioned kind with wooden fingers pointing the different directions
one points toward canada
we tip off the sign as larrys car passes and recedes
there is a canoe strapped to its roof
beautiful wooded remote
the car is parked at waters edge having backed down a lane of two tracks worn through the undergrowth
larry and arthur are lowering the canoe into water
larry hugs him
they separate and larry pulls a white envelope from his pocket and gives it to arthur
thisll help you get back on your feet
arthur looks into the envelope
oh my god
where did you get this
when you this is a lot of money
it should get you started
this is a lot of money
are you sure you dont need it
arthur im fine
come on get in
when youre settled
arthur climbs into the canoe
let me know how to get in touch
he helps push the boat off
arthur is twisted around looking back
as he drifts off are you sure this is okay
arthur waves bravely back then turns to pick up the oars
a couple of strokes and he turns back again with a last thought
he calls larry
what i said last night
a lingering look from arthur and then he turns back to row
blood spurts from the back of uncle arthurs neck
he slumps forward dead
larry looks wildly around
he sees gar brandt and mitch in their camo fatigues hard to pick out in the foliage
they are looking off toward the canoe mitch just lowering his rifle
gar brandts look swings around into the lens
he points at us theres another jew son
mitch swings his rifle toward us
gasping awake in the motel room
he looks around
it is dawn
arthur sits on the edge of his bed in his underwear staring off into space slackjawed vacant eyed drained
larry gazes around the room waiting for things to fall into place
finally blearily were we
out at the pool last night
arthur still staring off responds in a flat empty voice yes
larry blinks sleep away
after a beat its shabbas
arthur heaves a deep sigh
ill go drain my cyst
a two urinal two stall mens room of old tile and yellowed fixtures
we are low
one of the stall doors is closed
under it we see the dress shoes and dress pants of two young men standing inside
we hear a long sucking inhale
ronnie nudells voice gimme that fucker
a loudly projected echoing male voice yaamod habrayshit
danny seated in the second pew next to his parents and sister and uncle arthur rises and shuffles along the row to the aisle
his eyes are wide and red rimmed
the prelapped voice was his call to the torah
all eyes in the congregation which fills the large sanctuary are on him
in great echoing silence he walks to the steps on the right side of the bema and climbs
the right side lectern is surrounded by a gaggle of old jewish men
they busy themselves with the preparation of the pair of scrolls on the lectern rolling them pausing rolling some more muttering prayers kissing the scrolls by means of their tsitsim
they pay danny no attention
danny takes his place centered behind the lectern
his chin comes up to the bottom of the reading platform
men continue to mutter prayers around him
a pair of hands appear on his shoulders from behind
danny looks down at the strange hands
they pull him back
a foot drags a small riser out from under the lectern
hands push danny up onto the riser
booming up on the torah scrolls still being busily rolled
beyond it a sea of faces
the yad a molded tin pointer is thrust into dannys hand
the non pointing end has a red silken tassel
danny looks at the bouncing tassel
he looks at the little pointing finger which is the business end of the yad
men mutter around him each a different prayer
they dip and doven
danny watches himself point the yad down at the scroll
the scroll is a dense swarm of hebrew letters
one voice separates from the murmurs around him
it chants insistently in a sotto voce nefesh echad sheichayim yitzeh gamor shel effashot
danny is still staring at the end of the yad against the parchment scroll
someones hand enters and moves the yad to a different place in the text
the voice repeats nefesh echad sheichayim yitzeh gamor shel effashot
danny looks up from the scrolls
in the congregation ronnie nudell sits hunched shouldered and squished between his parents
he returns dannys red rimmed slack jawed stare
the insistent voice nefesh echad shelchayim yitzeh gamor shel effashot
danny looks over
from the surrounding scrum the prompter nods at him
he looks somewhat like cantor youssele rosenblatt
nefesh echad shelchayim yitzeh gamor shel effashot
danny looks back down at the scroll
a hand enters to tap a pointing finger where the yad points
nefesh echad shelchayim yitzeh gamor shel effa danny suddenly erupts nefesh echad shelchayim yitzeh gamor shel effashot
danny continues to boom out the torah portion
he moves the yad along the line of letters
in the congregation larry and judith watch
we hear danny chanting fluently and larry squeezes the hand judith has laced through his arm
juith whispers im sorry that
things have been so hard for us
sy had so much respect for you larry
he pats her hand
he wrote letters to the tenure committee
the congregation is loudly singing vzos hatorah
a tallised man of late middle age hoists the open scroll from the lectern and raises it high turning his back on the congregation so that all may see it
danny has been ensconced in a highbacked chair upstage on the bema
his point of view of the man holding the torah is close and steeply raked
the man is sweating
the heavy scrolls vibrate slightly from his effort to keep them aloft
as the congregation continues to sing he mutters under his breath jesus christ
danny stands behind the left lectern facing rabbi nachtner who holds a small kiddush cup out to him
although rabbi nachtner seems to be addressing danny he is projecting loudly
taking your place as a member of our tribe
you will go and see rabbi minda after the service
you will cele brate in a reception downstairs in schanfield hall
and then you will be a member of bnai abraham and of the nation of israel
danny gopnik the sisterhood makes a gift to you of this kiddush cup so that you will remember this blessed day on the next shabbas and the next and on
every shabbas of a long and fruitful life and until that wonderful day when you stand under the chupa we say
danny still red eyed tries to focus
his point of view shows the kiddush cup large in the foreground extended toward him by the rabbi beaming above
his own hand rises into frame to grasp the kiddush cup
the congregation starts adon olam
the cut has snapped off the robust adon olam leaving sepulchral quiet
danny clutching his kiddush cup hesitantly enters the dim study
mindas elderly eastern european gatekeeper closes the door behind him
minda is an old man staring at him from behind a bare desktop
his look eyes magnified by thick glasses is impossible to read
danny creeps to the chair facing the desk
he gingerly sits on the squeaking leather upholstery self conscious under mindas stare
minda breathes regularly through his mouth
it is the only sound in the room
a long beat
the two sit face to face
minda smacks his lips a couple of times preparing to speak
when the truth is found
to be lies
he clears his throat
at length and all the hope
within you dies
he smacks his lips again
danny doesnt answer
it is unclear whether the question was directed at him
minda clears his throat with a loud and thorough hawking
the hawking abates
these are the membas of the airplane
he nods a couple of times
he reaches up and slowly opens his desk drawer
he takes something out
he lays it on the bare desk and pushes it partway across
it is dannys radio
be a good boy
larry is at his desk sorting through mail
arlen finkle off danny was magnificent
larry looks up arlen is leaning in his accustomed spot in the office doorway

larry stares at him
thank you arlen
over his back as he goes arlen finkle i didnt say anything
distant thunder at the cut
we are tracking behind mindas female caliban as she walks down the hall stooped and shuffling
she holds a stack of papers in one hand
mail in front of him
he opens an envelope from ronald meshbesher esq
in it are two pieces of paper
topmost is a letter headed retainer underneath is an invoice
arriving rain begins to patter at the window
the teacher mar king leads the class in drill
danny has a book tilted towards him on his desktop
it hides his radio
the door opens and the elderly woman shuffles to mar kings desk
she hands him a paper from off her stack of copies
mar king puts on reading glasses and inspects it
as he reads thunder crashes closer
he fingers the invoice
close on a printed detail payable and typed underneath upon receipt
wind is whipping rain hard against the window
mar king taps on the desktop for attention
mar king chaverim theres a tornado warning from the weather service
rabbi minda has decided to move us over to the basement of the shul
hubbub in the classrooom
were gonna form two lines
this is orderly
he is staring down at his desktop
he reaches up and scratches his nose as he stares at his desk
on the desk a ledger sheet with a list of students names
next to each name a grade
larry drums his fingers
he picks up a pencil
he goes down to park clive
next to it is an f
he waggles the pencil eraser end thumping the sheet
he erases the f
he enters a c
the pencil leaves frame
we hold for a beat on the new grade
the hand reenters
it puts a minus sign after the c
the hand withdraws
larry closes the file
just as he does so the phone jangles very harsh
larry looks at it frozen
he lets it ring a couple times
he reaches for it
he slowly picks it up
hi len shapiro
shapiro listen mazel tov on danny
yes thank you
shapiro listen could you come in to discuss these x ray results
larry sits frozen phone to his ear
shapiro larry could you come in and discuss these x ray results
remember the x rays we took
we cant discuss them on the phone
shapiro i think wed be more comfortable in person
can you come in
now is good
ive cleared some time now
the students mill about
it is overcast dark and extremely windy
someone is fumbling with keys at the shul
danny still has his radio with the earpiece in
everyones clothing flaps
ronnie nudell shouts above the wind ronnie nudell that fucking flag is gonna rip right off the flagpole
we are looking through a windshield lashed by rain at larry driving
his hands are clenched tight on the wheel
wipers pump to keep up with the rain
the cars behind have their lights on
it has gotten quite dark
passing streetlights rhythmically sweep larrys face their light stippled and bent by the rain on the windows
danny is looking across the lot in which orange school busses are parked
his head bobs in time to the music
his hair whips in the wind
a building roar very deep
we hear very compressed the beginning of somebody to love
danny sees a shaggy haired youth among the milling students
from behind danny over his shoulder we see a funnel cloud in the middle distance
a growing rumble
the tornado is approaching
at the first downbeat of its chorus the jefferson airplane song bumps up full
we cut to black and credits
