an english bobby passes a woman in th century costume in the fog
he tips his hat and moves on
a caped man steps out of the fog and strangles her
passengers are taking their seats
ted spots elaine and moves towards her
the terrorists look confused
joe salucci clutches his case and wipes his brow
mary takes a mans suit bag

dramatic stock footage of clouds parting and sun exploding through
ted moves up to elaine who is about to enter the cockpit
she turns and gasps

zoom to closeup of elaines face
rumack and elaine walk across the well groomed lawn
elaine carries a box of spaghetti to go
as they walk they pass patients in wheelchairs pushed by nurses
the further they walk the more wheelchairs appear until the lawn is jammed with two hundred wheelchairs bumping into each other patients falling out total wheelchair chaos
ted seemed to get worse after i told him about simon doctor
the human brain is a highly complex organ elaine perhaps the most complex next to the bladder
he stops at a patient in a wheelchair with his back to let me show you
rumack removes the top of the patients skull and takes out his brain as they continue on teds problem is in this area
points with a pencil this area this area here here here under here here
they walk out of frame as wheelchair demolition derby fills rumack and elaine walk into frame still talking
so you see our task isnt made any easier by teds refusal to admit that hes sick
what can i do doctor rumack
he stops next to a sign hospital garden
you can eat balanced meals exercise and take geritol
i mean for ted
you can be gentle with him elaine
hes been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden
is that a good sign doctor
rumack holds the hospital garden sign
it does the job
he is ripping up small trees shrubs etc
and throwing them onto a huge pile of mud that resembles the mountain that dreyfuss built in close encounters
ted ignores her as he works frantically
holding out box i brought you some spaghetti
ted still ignores her as he works feverishly
what are you doing ted
ive got it elaine
ive figured out whats wrong with the shuttle
ted scurries around
not now elaine
he ignores her
rumack walks up and puts an arm around her shoulder
elaine starts to sob
the brain is an amazingly complex organ elaine

elaine is taken aback
sparks fly fire spreads
mary moves down the aisle checking passengers
she passes father oflanagan who reads alterboy magazine an alterboy in bikini bathing suit on cover
she passes mrs
gooch who reads high times
she stops at a ten year old girl
i guess this is pretty exciting for you
yes it is
how long will the trip take
our actual flight time is over fourteen months but due to the time space variant at sub light speeds our onboard flight time will be just over eighteen hours
mary leaves and the girl turns to the woman beside her
gee mom how does that work
very tense how many times do i have to tell you im not your mother
ive never seen you before
the woman vibrates in multiple image and grabs her temple
why did she yell at me like that
a man who looks like robert young sits down beside the girl
hallucinating again rhonda
taking a paper bag away from her face i dont know what it is
maybe its the brand of glue youve been sniffing

ted breathes deeply on an oxygen unit
he stops but we still hear deep breathing
loosen to find father oflanagan smoking a joint
he smiles and leaves
joe salucci clutches his attache case and wipes his brow
mary leans over him
you should really put that case in the compartment above your head sir
nervously thats okay
touching his shoulder i can help you if you cant get it up
i said no
mary leaves giving him a worried look
jimmy holds his dog
i sure an glad they let scraps ride up here with us
i bet scraps is going to love mercury
do you think things will be a lot different on mercury dad
its going to be terrific
a whole new world new kids to play with
youre going to love it jimmy
no more headlines about the rape trial and the fraud charges
starts to twitch how many kids get a chance to live on another planet
no more kids yelling your old mans a thieving rapist
grabbing jimmy look a man can make an honest mistake
anyway she was asking for it
theyre all asking for it all the time
not johns irregularity again
ted throws water on his face wipes it off with a towel while staring into himself in the mirror
he sees the psychiatrist in the mirror
the psychiatrist also washes up
you must admit that youre sick ted
the psychiatrist looks for the echo
ted throws the paper towel into the toilet and flushes
the toilet sparks and smokes and keeps running
the running gets more intense as ted tries to stop it by hitting the handle
ted has to hold himself back as the suction builds in force
he is just able to escape and shut the door behind him
ted leans his back against the door and breathes heavily
we seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four sir
you better check it unger
getting up done
ted spots elaine coming
i dont know why you got on this flight
i dont know what youre trying to prove
elaine we have to go back
we cant go back
we had something very special but its all over
elaine i mean the mission has to be aborted
this ship should never have passed fsa inspection
this thing is held together by string and chewing gum
a cupboard door labeled emergency use only swings open behind elaine revealing shelves of gum and string
elaine shuts it without looking inside
ted get a grip on yourself
you should never have left the hospital
then you do think im insane
ive never used the word insane ted
facetiously what word would you use elaine
the word is sick
ted very very very sick
what would you say if i told you the toilet just blew up in my face
id use the word insane
theres something dangerously wrong with this ship elaine
i know its the wiring
that toilets just the tip of the iceberg
ted a toilets not going to kill anyone
unger jiggles the handle of the running toilet
suddenly it sucks in towels etc
unger is pulled down
he fights back grabbing onto towel rack that comes out of the wall
the texan with talmud is now trying to wrap himself in tfilin
ted walks down the aisle checking overhead panels
he spots a panel that is half open
a sign on the door reads danger vacuum
ted opens it and a hoover falls out on his head cutting him
he holds a hanky to the wound and passes by stellas seat
youve been hurt
im getting over it
if a relationship isnt working you cant force it
no i mean your head
ill take a look at it
im a nurse
ted sits down and stella starts patching him up
do you want to talk about it
i opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me
i mean your relationship
we were in love but im not sure i know what love is anymore
loves the same as it always was
its people who change
people change in relation to each other
love changes on its own
not if the people change together in relation to that love
but thats only when the love itself goes unchanged
then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when theres change in the two people who share that love
i just wish it was that simple
we really were in love
you know how it is when you laugh all the time
stella looks to her father who is reading mortuary world magazine
its hard to l a u g h when your fathers dying
well we laughed
we laughed all the time
they run towards each other
elaine grabs ted by the waist picks him up and swings him around in slow motion
we laughed when times were good
the grave is surrounded by mourners in black with umbrellas
we pan the weeping crowd until we get to ted and elaine
they are also dressed in black and drenched
he holds her high by the waist twirls her around as they laugh
even when times werent so good we still laughed
they are locked in each others arms in the middle of lovemaking and laughing heir heads off
but most of all we laughed when we felt closest to each other
thats our story
passengers are standing
they hiss and throw vegetables at ted
dunn checks a red flashing light on his panel
to oveur sir ive got an overload in disposal unit four
you better check on it mr
ill stay here and fly the ship
dunn gets up
you better take this
oveur throws him a plunger and gives him a thumbs up
they exchange that man must do what a man must do smile
mary enters with jimmy wilson carrying scraps
mind if jimmy here takes a look around captain
of course not
come on in jimmy
checking his navigational screen thats strange
simon leans over oveurs shoulder
scraps looks at oveur
jimmy looks at the array of dials etc
thats an asteroid field
there shouldnt be anything like that in this sector unless
scraps looks at simon
scraps looks at oveur
unless those sunspots are interfering with our scanner or
scraps looks at simon
scraps looks at oveur
or were off course but
scraps looks at simon
scraps looks at oveur
but we couldnt be off course
our coordinates are computer locked barring
scraps looks at simon
scraps looks at oveur
barring a computer failure
there was talk of sub par wiring in this ship
i hope thats just talk
scraps ears prick up
simon moves past jimmy stops at the door and downs a handful of anti fear pills before leaving
come on up jimmy
say thats some puppy
whats his name
can i hold him
handing over scraps sure
holding him up and looking at his underbelly hes a boy dog
do you like it when scraps sleeps on his back jimmy
ted and stella
stella is feeding her father and listening to ted

i know everyone in those places claims theyre sane but i was different i was sane
ted notices unger float by outside his window

he tries to take a drink and pours it on his forehead
elaine is fighting the fire with an extinguisher
she gets it out and looks at the burnt wires in the area labeled rok moral centre
zoom to closeup of elaine
she turns holy shit

stella shakes teds arm

stella hands him a pill which he pops automatically but misses his face with his drink
she leaves the bottle next to ted
zoom on bottle
stella starts feeding her father again
the ship jolts and his face goes into the tray
elaine fiddles with the computer
to rok request comprehensive electrical systems check
systems check positive
look elaine request life support systems check
life support check
elaine its obvious youve been ignoring me
youre a woman
i can relate to that
panicky and confused request self analysis of rok hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes
theres nothing wrong with me elaine
what about tonight just you and me
we can be alone
i can get rid of everyone else on the ship ive already proven that
elaine gasps and moves away from roks blinking eye
simon takes a long slug from a flask
loosen to find jimmy and scraps
do you want to talk about it commander
dunn is about to enter with the plunger as mary passes
the ship jolts and she falls into his arms
did you feel that
looking at his pants yes i did
felt like a large asteroid
yes it did
dunn can i ask you a personal question
what is it mary

dunn gives her a look and opens the washroom door
dunn is immediately pulled down to the raging toilet bowl
he grabs for the door screaming
mary hears the scream and gives a look as she leaves
testa is serving the walters coffee from a steaming pot

testa spots dunns tattered sleeve emerge from the washroom door groping for a handhold
she screams and dumps coffee in ediths face
she runs to help dunn grabs his sleeve
it comes off in her hands
she keeps pulling
his jacket comes off his pants underwear socks an entire clothesline of garments like bras towels etc
she hears a scream
elaine and oveur
elaine stands over his shoulder
i dont think we have any alternative captain
what do you think our alternatives are
we have to disconnect roks higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system
you can do it from up here captain
id rather sit down for this one elaine
no i mean you can do it from the cockpit
you better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit
elaine leaves and mary enters
captain the coffee machine is jammed and i dont like it

mary gives a why didnt i think of that look
captain oveur dunn and unger have been sucked out through disposal unit four
dunn and unger have been sucked out through disposal unit four

they all clasp hands and yell
it careens through asteroids
oveur is pulling curcuit board from rok panel
what are you doing captain
oveur eyes rok but keeps working
i wouldnt do that captain
smoke spews out
he hears a hiss and looks at a vent
he grabs his throat and collapses
an asteroid bounces off hull
blonde woman in viking helmet with spear stands and screams operatically
simon enters and spots oveur slumped in his seat
he pulls him up
points to his mouth pocket
points to his pocket vent
points to vent gas
points to radio that plays sox
simon rips open his coat grabs pills and takes them himself letting oveur drop
simon looks down at the navigational screen it resembles an old amusement parlor roadrace game
to self were off course heading right through that asteroid field and right at the

the ship takes another violent shot
the passengers are screaming
he stands in the aisle

elaine addresses the passengers
to passengers please ladies and gentlemen please calm down

they calm down
weve been thrown off course just a tad
whats that mean

the passengers appear interested and sensible nod their heads
the bumps you feel are car sized asteroids smashing into the hull
the hood of a car smashes through the cabin wall
the passengers still appear interested and sensible

passengers still appear interested and sensible
they all put on sunglasses

he wears a raincoat and shirt and tie
he is met by controller
they move across room
mccrosky get me a cup of coffee mister
mccrosky and a gallon of milk of magnesia and a ham on rye no cheese

then the dinosaurs came but were too big and died and everything got rotten and turned into oil and the arabs bought mercedes benzs and then there was the best
tv special on judy garland
then we lost the war with albania
mccrosky leaves jacobs babbling
mccrosky things sure havent changed
mccrosky stands in front of a huge painting of himself
both he and painting are in the same pose one hand loosens the tie he drinks coffee with the other a cigarette dangles from his lip
he is lost in thought
super images ted getting electro shock psychiatrist telling him hes sick ted building the close encounters mound ted is shaken out of his dream by elaine
listen to me ted

ted weve lost the crew and simons turned to jelly
simon is a jelly mold inside a uniform
on radio come in mayflower
this is mission control

jimmy pokes his head in
do you want to talk about it now commander
elaine stands over ted looking at the empty bottle of stress pills
stella approaches in nurses uniform splattered with blood
a cigarette dangles from her lip
she wipes her hands on a blood splattered towel
hes finally come to terms with his own psychosis
but he was right
hes not crazy
miss im a nurse with a dying f a t h e r i know what im talking about
now im going to need fresh sheets gauze q tips and all the vaseline you have on board
elaine leaves looking back at ted with empathy
to mary ill need all the boiling water you can get your hands on
mary leaves and a man passes holding a tattered arm
are you a nurse
handing him a urine bottle the washrooms down there on your right
the man leaves a quizzical look on his face
yelling after him and not too much
a black u
army sergeant imagine jim brown approaches stella
can i help
stella hands him an m
keep an eye on that side of the ship
the sergeant drops into a seat next to a window smashes out the glass with his rifle butt and is immediately sucked out
mary moves down the aisle with a cart collecting boiling water
to passengers ill need all your boiling water
passengers pull pots of boiling water from under their seats handbags coat pockets and pour them into the passing container
testa reassures bob and alice wilson
we should be out of this momentarily
theres nothing to worry about
that makes me feel so much better
testa leaves and father oflanagan approaches with last rites paraphernalia
trust me im a priest
were in shit up to our ears
who wants last rites
he is now completely entangled in the tfilin and struggles to free himself
elaine passes ted carrying sheets vaseline etc
she looks at him sitting there in a fog gives up and leaves
ted looks at the red flashing fasten your seatbelts sign
it takes him back
we see the hospital deep in b
across an expansive lawn
suddenly teds face pops into frame closeup
he looks both ways and bolts
he wears a straightjacket
suddenly the dogs scramble into frame in front of the sign slobbering
a half dozen viscious looking guards in reflector shades with shotguns whips nets cattle prods follow
southern accent damn
i want that patient shot on sight
ted stands at window
a neon bar sign flashes outside so close to the window that the only way to read it is to rent this room
maybe you gotta be crazy to end up behind the eight ball like this
anyway you find out pretty fast who your friends are when youre on the lamb
ted turns away from the window and passes the lamb in bed
to lamb im going out for cigarettes and a fifth of bourbon
dont wait up for me
ted grabs his straightjacket and leaves
nothin but headaches
a bo peep staff is flung against door as it closes behind him
an empty spotless wet street
one car parked under a street lamp
i travelled at night in the shadows
i didnt want to attract attention
i was afraid to step out of the doorways
you never know what to expect when youre on the run
ted steps into light
gloria steinam passes with cab calaway
a grand piano smashes to pavement next to ted
he ignores piano and gives gloria and cab a quizzical look
he steps in a puddle where a bar cocktails sign is reflected
the reflection shatters
a streetcleaning truck approaches spewing out garbage rather than water
teds ankles are sprayed with garbage
he bends down and picks up a wet matchbook harrys place standing looking at a bar
the glow of flashing neon sign reflects off his face
he pulls out a cigarette
a womans hand shoots into frame holding a lit zippo
ted draws deeply on the cigarette
there i was minding my own business when i looked up and saw a pair of legs that went forever
pan up and up and up
she is all legs no torso no head just legs about two stories high
but i had a date with harrys
it was little more than a hole in a wall on the south side of chicago
bashed in the side of a brick wall
a neon sign over the hole reads harrys goodtime bar
dark smokey bar
pan very tough faces standing along the bar
harrys was perfect for me
the kind of place you go if you dont want to be recognized
keep panning tough faces but now they all wear groucho glasses and noses
it was rough real rough
with four players all have broken thumbs in casts
the kind of place you could score anything from junk
one guy hands another guy a large rusted car fender for money
to phil donahues book
phil donahue signs a stack of books at a table
at harrys you could count on a fight breaking out almost every night
two professors argue at a table
and i say essence precedes existence
existence precedes essence
professor slugs professor sending him flying across the room
professor gets up and throws a judo chop which professor stops by holding a book up in both hands
the book splits in two like a piece of wood split by a karate chop
there was a small trio in one corner
two midgets play light jazz piano and bass
and a larger trio in the other corner
five pound musicians play some tune in another corner
he pulls out a cigarette
a bare foot with zippo held in toes comes into frame and lights it
the last thing i wanted was elaine to see me down on my luck
well it was just my luck
in she walked with a group from the space program
elaine and simon and two other couples who look like clean cut nasa types out of the right stuff walk in laughing and take a table
theyd come to harrys to slum it and try their hand at the video bull
the group prod elaine to try the bull
a cowboy hat flies across the room
she grabs it pulls it on and moves to the bull which is surrounded by others in cowboy hats
elaine hops in the saddle
a sinister character puts a quarter in and madly flips knobs
the saddle doesnt move all the action is on the screen but elaine throws one hand back and kicks her legs
elaine made that ride look easy
it was obvious why i was still nuts about her
she loved life
i didnt want her to notice me so i borrowed a pair of dark glasses
ted takes a pair of dark glasses off a passing blind man who walks perfectly until the glasses are gone then starts stumbling and crashes over a table
grabbed an alto sax and joined the group
ted takes an alto sax from a passerby who also stumbles and crashes over a table when he loses his sax
i stayed in the background not wanting to draw attention to myself
everyone looks around trying to see where the terrible grating sax sound is coming from
then what happened
elaines crowd talks her into joining us for a song
elaine hops up on the stage grabs a mike and starts to sing stormy weather
she sidles up to ted and goes into a medley of old songs
elaines singing is just as bad as teds sax
they have cleared the joint and play and sing alone
elaines group finally pull her out
she hasnt recognized ted
to ted i dont know who you are or how you lost your sight but ill never forget this night as long as i live
pull back leaving ted alone on the stage still playing
chairs are turned up on tables
one table has chairs turned up with the people still sitting in the chairs
getting a glass of water outside cockpit door
as the door opens we hear come in mayflower
simon shuts the door and bumps into ted who is getting a drink of water
simon takes a drink of booze
kurtz youre drunk
whos in command of this ship
that damn computer has taken over
im getting out
then elaine was right
dont talk to me about elaine
outta my way
grabbing simon pull yourself together
weve got to
simon slugs ted who falls into a corner and hits his head
zoom to closeup of ted unconscious
the ship takes another violent jolt
it roars through the asteroid field
simon sits on toilet seat and slides open a wall panel
father oflanagan slides open an adjacent wall panel and sits down
father what should i do
have you considered suicide my son
a panel on the other side of simon slides open
do you want to talk about it now commander
mccrosky holding radio mike come in mayflower
do you read me
mccrosky throws the mike down
taking mike let me try sir
come in mayflower
controller throws the mike even harder
taking mike let me try sir
controller smashes the mike through the monitor screen
let me try sir
controller smashes the monitor with an axe
controller smashes the monitor with an electric guitar
other controllers line up for their turns with various heavy implements
angle on mccrosky mccrosky to controller stinson have you contacted the families of the passengers and crew
mccrosky looks out window
mccrosky try and calm them down
and for god sake be diplomatic
stinson turns to two burly men in leather jerkins and black hoods
they hold a large caldron of molten lead next to window
give em the lead
they pour it out
it careens through the asteroid field towards the sun
ted lies unconscious
shes doing her rounds takes a medical chart from the back of a seat
to a male passenger im afraid that legs going to have to come off
a leg is passed to her from out of frame
she takes it while still looking at the chart
this isnt your chart
you just had a touch of air sickness
handing him back his leg youll be fine
a woman sitting next to the man who is holding his leg grabs stella
shakes her hand and im a nurse
everything will be okay
pass it on
the man with the leg passes it to the passenger in seat behind
everything will be okay
pass it on
the leg gets passed from seat to seat as passengers say everything will be okay
pass it on
lying unconscious in a corner
a puppy crawls into frame and starts licking his face
loosen to find jimmy standing over ted
ted comes to feels his jaw and pulls himself up
the ship jolts

a large ivory colored vibrator drops out of her purse hits the floor and flips on

the passengers with cups hang over him
he makes contact with a wire
to self contact

coffee gushes out like an oil well coming in
the passengers dance under the gusher of brown liquid mouths open and cheering
mccrosky how are we going to handle this bomb nut

jacobs stands next to kruger rubbing his forefingers together in the shame shame sign

hes got a point ted
there are columns under krugers and strikers names
striker has two check marks

low cost housing

if you blast here in the computer core and the fuselage doesnt give way here and the main communication lines to the cockpit hold here and this baby here doesnt
jam this little old unit up here and throw about two tons of hot steel through here like a hot knife through butter and the upper and lower
mccrosky whats your point sarg

joe you dont want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people
i dont want to live anymore
joe the insurance policy wont help your wife and kids

inching up on him thats right joe
now no ones going to hurt you and no one has to know whats wrong with you
ted is almost up to joe when yells thats the guy from the terminal who cant get it up
ted tackles him
the case flies into the air in slow motion
it turns slowly hanging for the longest time as we cut still in slow motion to horrified faces watching it
this slow motion sequence lasts for about seconds people put on make up do macrame read etc
while the case is still in the air
suddenly scraps leaps high into the air in slow motion and comes down with the case between his teeth
controllers huddle over one monitor
mccrosky get that bomb striker
get that bomb
come in control
we have the bomb
hes got the bomb
this is just like an election in iran
ted is back at the controls the cockpit is incredibly hot now
this heats getting unbearable
he looks down and sees two eggs frying on the dash
but it is a dry heat ted
controllers are grouped around the plans
mccrosky do we use the bomb to blow that computer or is there another way
i want to know what everyone thinks

gary coleman could host
the passengers stand in the aisle listening to mary
now i want everyone to move to the front of the cabin
passengers move calmly
we just want everyone as far away from the blast as possible
the passengers panic and stampede right over her
ted wears a gas mask and attaches the time bomb to the computer
what are you doing ted

gas spews out of a vent
ted makes sure his gas mask is tight
simon is dressed in space suit and moving down the aisle

simon steps into a hatch labeld escape capsule
im saying i cant take the singles scene again elaine
the hatch door slams shut
a passenger passes with a sandwich board that reads jesus was a single
jimmy appears and yells through the window on the hatch

the capsule ejects
the commissioner stands in front of the painting of astronauts on black velvet

simon was a fool to eject now
thats right premature ejection
what will happen to him ted
the sun will heat that thing to over degrees within seconds
hell roast like a pig on a spit
we see a roast on a spit through the window
the clock on the time bomb ticks down
looking at wristwatch are you afraid
not when im with you ted
i guess youd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this
gooch sucks on her cushion shes totally zonked on acid

looking at her hands are these my hands
to stella are you afraid
im a nurse
i cant afford to be afraid father
to scraps are you afraid scraps
he barks once subtitle translate now when theres a guy like ted striker up there jimmy
he barks one more time subtitles now how about a little scratch on the inner thigh
testa stands over ted with a clipboard
fifty six percent of the passengers are afraid
twenty nine percent are not afraid
eight percent are undecided and seven percent think israel should give back finland
you better strap yourself in testa
on radio mission control this is mayflower
go ahead striker
on radio weve got about seconds before that thing blows
were set to reprogram for mercury at zero point five worp
mccroksy on radio zero point five worp
when the bomb explodes were going to have a ten foot hole in the fuselage and i want to get there as fast as i can
i know what this snip can do mccrosky
mccroksy to controllers no ones ever travelled at that speed before
last spring we did europe in nine days
it careens towards the sun
bomb clock ticks down
mary instructs passengers
heads between the knees
looking down aisle between your own knees father
oflanagan looks around guiltily
mccrosky addresses his troops
mccrosky i dont find it easy to talk at a time like this but i want to say something about that guy up there
i can sum it all up in one word courage dedication spirit pride selflessness and g u t s guts
strikers got more guts in his little finger than most of us have in our large intestine
hes got guts up to his eyeballs guts coming out of his ears
controllers start playing cards doing needlepoint
mccrosky sure its a cliche but great shortstops are born not made and a clown is funny in the circus but when he gets on the highway hes murder
it bugged me too when mr
ed refused to talk when the neighbors came over but
the bomb ticks down and blows
the ship shakes violently
ted fights for control
the ship starts bumping as if its hit a rough road
on radio weve blown the computer
to elaine elaine
set course change
flips a switch set
pushes a button compute
compute sign flashes
ted pulls an acceleration lever
it slows to a halt
ted pulls the lever hard toward himself
the ship shudders
the ship slingshots in the opposite direction disappearing into the void leaving a trail of light
on radio point five worp
pan controllers looking intently into the night sky
pan to mrs
salucci intently gripping her vibrator its on
pan to jacobs reading variety headline paramount announces mccrosky zero point five worp thats half the speed of light
we really have no idea what can happen to the human body at that speed
two passengers contortionists with legs up over their shoulders and looking out over their rear ends play cards
the interior vibrates
a psychedelic blaze of multi colored light illuminates the interior
ted struggles with the controls
striker were monitoring you
youre right on course
at that speed you should hit mercury in about six minutes
so give yourself enough time to kill those worp engines
mccrosky on radio well be out of radio range in a few seconds
im going to put you in contact with mercury base alpha beta for your final descent
off mike stinson whos in command of alpha beta
its rex kramer now
mccrosky not rex kramer
no rex kramer
we see the alpha beta base in distance with an alpha beta neon sign flashing
four uniformed officers race to their posts around a corner and collide with four others racing around the corner from the other direction
rex kramer watches the floors flash by on the panel above the door
we hear a dog growling and fighting with something
i know this guy ted striker
i flew with him during the war
he was a crack pilot but he didnt have it in the crunch
until that day over chicago
he brought that busted up out of that storm like a paper glider coming outta the baby blue
but flying that shuttle is a whole different ballgame
the elevator doors open
kramer steps out into the communications room
pan down to floor of elevator to find a young officer carey torn to shreds and fighting off kramers golden retriever dog
the doors close
kramer approaches an whats the latest lieutenant
theyll hit our atmosphere in about three minutes if they hold together
theyve lost their computer and are coming in at zero point five worp on manual control sir
ted shifts a stick shift on the steering column
kramer looks at the big screen
a submarine periscope drops
kramer looks for the shuttle
hell never bring that thing in on manual but i guess strikers their only hope
its his ship now
hes the top dog
the big man
the numero uno honcho
the head cheese
kramer steps away from the scope
it drops down
a man in a barber chair is on the other end of the steel column and comes to rest on the floor
sir we have radio contact
testa talks to the passengers
psychedelic lights flash
yelling were travelling at one half the speed of light
there is nothing to worry about
however you might experience some temporary metabolic changes
her beard grows
a flurry of hands empties it in two seconds
he has turned into a hassidic rabbi
ted is fighting to maintain control
striker this is rex kramer on alpha beta
do you read me
ted and elaine give startled looks of recognition
thats right ted
weve locked you on track beam
youre going to have to kill those worp engines in exactly thirty seconds
everyone tensely looks out the window into the night sky
mccrosky theres nothing else we can do for those people out there now except pray
the entire room explodes in an up beat southern baptists rendition of hes got the whole world in his hands
ted pushes his worp lever forward but it comes off in his hand
ted the lever
on radio kramer the worp control handle just came off in my hand
try another handle
there are no more handles only switches
looking around madly just switches lights and knobs
looking at buttons and levers on his panel id give my right arm to get just one of these buttons or levers up there right now
on radio okay striker
youre going to have to pull that lever panel off
to elaine screw driver
she hands him a vodka and orange juice
ted throws it on his face
he reaches down and rips the panel off exposing all sorts of wires
now find a piece of metal and stick it in there
ted looks around for a piece of metal
elaine pulls a bobby pin from her hair
will this work ted
her long brown hair falls sexily
she sweeps it back with a toss of her head
ted is overwhelmed by her
on radio ive got something that might work
a bobby pin
kramer and aids exchange a look which questions teds sexuality
what the hell is a man doing with a
on radio itll have to do striker
ted sticks the bobby pin into the wires
the ship starts slowing up
kramer stands in front of the huge screen
a small ship appears in the distance coming right at us
on radio okay striker
we have you on visual
just keep her level
it careens towards the planet surface
it starts bouncing wildly
shes coming apart
the anchorman screams
the anchorman screams
in russian looking print
the desk clerk screams
keep her nose up
dont fight her
im trying but shes fighting me
a boxing glove springs from the dash punching ted in the face
ted thats alpha beta
we see the lights of a small colony on planet surface
the alpha beta neon sign is visible
kramer sits in a large swivel chair like captain kirks on the enterprise bridge
as he talks he nonchalantly swivels so his back is to the huge window
we see the mayflower approaching on the screen
on radio now striker there are a few things you have to keep in mind as you get close to the planets atmosphere
they watch in horror as the mayflower comes shooting at them
on radio first and foremost you have to make one very important decision
elaine looks out the window horrified
were not stopping
ted fights the controls
is this a landing youre sure you can make without endangering the lives of your passengers
they run for cover
the mayflower comes right at the screen and crashes through it
kramer still has his back to the screen and doesnt notice what has happened the room behind him has been totally demolished
on radio now once youve made that decision you have to be very clear about your responsibility to those people on that ship
the front window is broken
ted and elaine are covered in debris
elaines eyes grow wide with terror again
a group of scientists stand at a keyboard synthesizer
one plays the series of notes from close encounters
suddenly the mayflower appears over a hill
they all jump for cover as it crashes through the synthesizer
ted and elaine are covered in piano keys
their lives their futures their goals and aspirations are in your hands striker
the mayflower bounces across the surface
mary maneuvers down the aisle
passengers are screaming and being tossed around
to one passenger seat backs up
she looks up and sees feet dangling from the ceiling
a man has gone right through the ceiling up to his waist
looking up sir you really must take your seat
on radio were all with you on this one striker
now get ready to position landing gear cut engines and fire your retrorockets
the mayflower careens to a smoking crunching shattering stop
mary and testa start directing panic striken passengers to the exits
on radio timings of the essence on a lame duck approach striker
dont fight her
hold her steady
ted and elaine stand looking down on the wreckage
sirens wail emergency lights flash across ted and elaine
youll be all right
everyones going to be okay
ted holds elaine
dont fight her striker
stay with her striker
ted and elaine kiss
now hit your landing gear and cut those engines
on radio timings everything striker
fire your retro rockets
ted and elaine walk off into the distance
voice fading now give her full flap and keep that nose up
ted whats going to happen to us
ted stops and looks into the distant dark sky
a printed crawl begins ted and elaine walk towards crawl and are approached by two strange creatures bald with a shock of hair sprouting from the top of their heads
hello wed like you to have this flower
