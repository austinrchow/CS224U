by robert pulcini and shari springer berman the room is dark
a perfectly square mirror hangs crooked on a wall
suddenly out of the darkness the reflection of a mans face comes into focus
he stares straight ahead perhaps studying his own unrecognizable reflection
its quite clear this is a portrait of sickness the mans pallor is gray his eyes are confused
there is something most definitely wrong
tentatively the figure steps away from the mirror leaving the frame empty and dark
like a ghost the naked man harvey stands over his bed staring down at his sleeping wife joyce
in the eerie light hes almost translucent
joyce springs up alarmed
whats wrong harvey
what are you doing up
harvey just stands there for a moment saying nothing
what is it
delirious out of breath tell me the truth
am i some guy who writes about himself in a comic book
or am i just am i just a character in that book
joyce rubs her eyes
if i die will dat character keep goin
or will he just fade away
joyce just stares at him unsure how to answer
suddenly harvey collapses
joyce leaps from the bed nervous hysterical
she gets down on the floor and shakes him
harvey wake up
his eyes remain closed his expression far far away
a surreal kaleidoscope of black white and red
similar to the mirror scene above the colors slowly come into focus revealing the chiseled features of a familiar face
but this time we see that it is not a real face but rather a plastic mask of the d
comic hero superman
it glows eerily in the light of a porch lamp
a childs pupils glare through the eye holes
the camera pans from superman to the masked face of another caped crusader batman
batman turns toward his loyal sidekick robin who clutches a plastic trick or treat pumpkin
next we find the green lantern as he reaches up to ring the doorbell
the camera finally rests on the last boy an unkempt kid wearing no costume at all
looking irritated and removed from the rest of the group the kid shoves his hands in the pockets of his shearling coat
he spits and rolls his eyes as a lady answers the door
the brick home is as working class as it gets
the lady at the door is a s housewife
in unison trick or treat
well look at this
all the superheroes on the porch
aint that cute
the lady drops a candy apple in each boys container
still yelling we got superman here batman his sidekick robin ohh the green lantern even
she finally stops at the costumeless kid
he halfheartedly holds up a ratty stained pillowcase
and what about you young man
what about what
the other boys giggle
the kid flashes them a kick yer ass look
who are you supposed to be
the kid shrugs
im harvey pekar pronounced pee car
that doesnt sound like a super hero to me
mumbling pecker pecker
i aint no super hero lady
im just a kid from the neighborhood alright
the housewife stares at him confused
ahh forget this
frustrated the kid throws his pillowcase down
he trudges off as the others watch in confusion
why is everybody so stoopid
we follow the schlumpy kid aka harvey pekar as he sulks down the street
a grown up version of harvey pekar now mid thirties stomps along the same cleveland street
unfortunately years have made this rust belt neighborhood a bit rustier
the grown up harvey dons the same shearling coat sports the same disheveled hair and wears the same curmudgeonly expression
with comic book panels of the cartoon harvey in action
this is not your typical super hero stuff
instead it features our man engaging in such daredevil feats as riding the city bus
working as a file clerk at the veterans hospital
trying to wash dishes
waiting on line at the supermarket
buying used records from a garage sale table
eating junk food at a greasy spoon
harvey fixes a rip in his coat with elmers glue
note each cartoon harvey looks similar but unique
a variation on a theme
this is because his cartoons are drawn by different comic artists
intermittently bold cartoon credits flash across the screen followed by the explosive title the high energy music and upbeat titles in direct contrast to the sulking image of harvey continue
through the remainder of the credits
were now on harveys back as he continues his forlorn journey
we move forward past him to peer over the hill at the factories below
were throwing a lot at ya here so lemme step in an help ya catch up
this is the story about comic books an a guy who made a whole life outta them
you could even say comics saved his life
this guy here hes our man harvey pekar all grown up and goin nowhere
although hes a pretty scholarly cat he never got much of a formal education
for the most part hes lived in shit neighborhoods held shit jobs and is now knee deep into a second disastrous marriage
so if yer lookin for romance or escapism or some fantasy figure to save the day guess what
ya got the wrong movie
the real harvey pekar not the actor who trudged through the credits sits behind a microphone supplying the voice over above
he clutches a movie script in his hand
the frame is spare with a few well chosen items to indicate that hes in a recording session
although he is significantly older than the man who portrays him the real harvey is every bit as much of a sad sack
maybe even more
he is large and slightly threatening with knitted brows and wild eyes
yet there is something kind and vulnerable about him a teddy bear who could kick your ass
off camera we hear the voices of the male and female directors us bob and shari coaching the real harvey through his voice over
harveys irritable and contrary saying that the whole halloween incident never even happened
but i dont care man
im just doing this for the dough
we learn that harvey is a reluctant participant in a film being made about his life
suddenly his third wife joyce brabner an intelligent control freak obsessed with all things negative joins in the conversation
pushing back her huge glasses she reprimands harvey like he is an infant harvey you are talking too loud harvey you are being difficult
harvey just rolls his eyes
joyce gets offended
it is clear they have had this argument a million times
as joyce storms off
harvey explains that his wife is trying to take over the movie
he laments that she is his third wife and he has no luck with women
man chicks just dont dig me
thats why he marries anyone who will have him
and i marry them fast before they get to know the real me
harvey sits on a table in his t shirt and underwear
a doctor unwraps a tongue depressor
harveys voice is hoarse raspy and barely audible
it sounds like it hurts for him to talk
yet he cant stop ranting
doc you gotta help me
my old ladys dumping me cause i cant talk
she says im a social embarrassment
now that shes got her phd shes some hot shit academic star an im nuthin but a file clerk with nothin ta say an no voice ta say it
but me bein a file clerk was fine when i wrote the damn check for her tuition harvey stop talking please and open wide
he points the tongue depressor at harveys mouth but he just keeps on going
i just dont get it
we were doin okay for a while
then we took that stupid belated honeymoon
i started losin my voice on the plane
can you believe that
on the plane doc
bad timing i guess
now please say ah mr
without missing a beat ahhh ruined the trip
i got crazy started to worry my voice would never come back
i mean my wife didnt know me so long before we got hitched
what if she totally forgets what im like
man its torture shhh
the doctor shines a penlight into harveys mouth and looks around
he raises an eyebrow
harvey catches this
hypochondria overtakes him
the penlight in his mouth what
is it bad doc
the doctor removes the penlight
its not good
harvey jumps off the table
first i got marital problems and now yer tellin me i got throat cancer
harvey calm down
its not cancer
you have a nodule on your vocal chords
probably from screaming and yelling too much
and if you dont stop talking and give it a rest youre gonna lose your voice completely
relieved harvey calms down
he nods agreeing to be good
but fer how long
a few months
suddenly harveys voice cracks under his effort to raise it
he sheepishly grabs his throat
more of that and youll do permanent damage
now go home keep your mouth shut and hopefully we wont have to operate
harvey gets nervous again
the doctor throws him his clothing
a silent sequence
a dejected harvey walks home alone along an empty lot
day old dirty snow clings to the ground
he wanders through a down in the heels neighborhood passing run down stores and ramshackle apartments
harvey approaches toby a dumpy something going on something in ridiculous mismatched polyester clothing
he is odd awkward and talks with a monotone robotic voice
in short he is a super dork
you werent in work today
are you okay harvey
harvey barely looks up
he nods his head yes and keeps walking
yelling after him im heading downtown to the white castle
wanna come harvey
harvey leaves toby behind and turns the corner
two women argue loudly over a payphone
in spanish i already told you im waiting for a call
since when is this your private office
since you can kiss my ass
harvey stops in his tracks and stares at them jealous of their ability to speak
close up spanish woman s mouth to himself look at em yakkin
how do they do it
out of the corner of her eye woman notices harvey eavesdropping
yelling at harvey ay what are you looking at
startled harvey moves on
he passes a group of kids playing in the snow
they scream yell and laugh with abandon
shaking his head they all make it seem so easy
harvey is awakened from his reverie by a snowball
the kids laugh loudly
he wipes away the snow and walks on
a voice over interrupts the scene
heres our man walking home from the doctors
hes got the weight of the world on him
and fer what really
cause his throats a little screwy
man people in india are starvin to death every day
his problems are nothin
totally dejected harvey crosses over train tracks on his way home
still he cant help feelin paranoid like some supernatural force is conspiring against him to rob him of his voice
harvey sulks up the steps of his brick low rise apartment building
he passes an elderly neighbor coming down the walk with her shopping cart
harvey unlocks the door
maybe his old lady will go easy on him today when she sees how upset he is
harveys second wife lana a hippyish chic with long hair and a bad attitude pulls books off a shelf and selectively throws them onto the floor or packs them into
a milk crate
an overstuffed suitcase sits beside her
shes obviously leaving him
harvey enters the room
what is this
harveys voice breaks up
exactly what it looks like
loud whattya mean
you mean yer dumpin me
his voice really rips ah shit
that last yell did it
harvey grabs throat in pain torn between his throat discomfort and trying to stop his wife from leaving
look your plebeian lifestyle isnt working for me anymore
clevelands not working for me anymore
i gotta get out of here before i kill myself
but she gathers her bags and heads for the door
harvey trails her trying to reason
he opens his mouth but nothing comes out
mouthing just a wheeze please
just listen to what i got to say
she turns and stares at him
harvey tries to say something
but now nothing at all comes out of his mouth
only wheezes air
he tries again
no sound at all
finally lana gives up turns back towards the door and leaves
at his cubicle in the file room harvey fills a cart with files
hes physically at work but mentally in a daze
heres our man yeah alright heres me or the guy playin me anyway though he dont look nothin like me but whatever
so its a few months later an im workin my flunky file clerk gig at the v
my voice still aint back yet
things seem like they cant get any worse
a nurse pops her head in
harvey hands her a file
thank you harvey dear
he doesnt hear her still stewing about lana
he shoves the last files in the cart and pushes it away
to himself plebeian
where the hell did she get that shit
we see rows and rows of endless files
still in a daze harvey removes the files from the cart and puts them on the shelves
avoid the reeking herd
shun the polluted flock
live like that stoic bird the eagle of the rock
harvey turns around
boats a portly african american maintenance worker wearing a bow tie steps into harveys row
he has a tool box
harvey resumes shelving
you know what that means son
its from an elinor hoyt wylie poem
it means stay away from the crowds of common ordinary people an do yer own thing
nope it means dont compromise yourself for women
aint gonna do you no good
get away from em as soon as you can
well i aint got no woman now
so im living like the stoic bird man
the only way to live son
somehow this doesnt make harvey feel any better about his life
harvey carries an armful of files
boats still trails him lugging his tool box
boats points out a young african american file clerk wearing a pair of big headphones on his afro
he moves as if hes listening to music
look at that fool over there
whats he wearing
thats an a
radio hes listening to
they got em fixed up now like a pair of earmuffs
inappropriately angered mmph
isnt that somethin
people have gone crazy
theyll buy any kinda junk
probably listening to that loud rock stuff
junk junk its all junk
well i dont know
rock musics got some good qualities
i mean it aint jazz or nothin
boats looks at him like hes crazy
say when you gonna bring me in some good records
some nat king cole with strings
i dont got any of that mr
boats stops and yells down the hall at harvey
yeah you got it
youre keepin it at home though
you wont turn loose the good stuff
you just sell the junk
harvey shakes his head as mr
boats finishes his diatribe
boats turns into a room
singing mona lisa mona lisa
men have named you
harvey sits on outdoor furniture
a few props are featured in the frame indicating a garage sale like setting including a record player
directly in front of harvey are boxes of used records
harvey shows us his prodigious record collection
thousands of lps rare jazz blues fusion klezmer etc
are piled in floor to ceiling bookcases
he tells us about his love of jazz and how he started writing jazz reviews and music articles
he finds the first record that he reviewed and puts it on his turntable
as the music plays
harvey talks about how he started buying and selling records
this leads into how he first met robert crumb
harvey a little more hair but the exact same style and a bunch of his buddies sift through old records at a junk sale
in the early sixties i was with some buddies at a junk sale looking for some choice sides when i met this shy retiring cat from philadelphia named bob crumb
you know the guy fritz the cat mr
natural an all they made a movie about him too
one of harveys pals marty pulls a record out of a box
you dig jay mcshann
you gonna buy that or what
harvey jumps up from his search to check out the lp
i dont know marty
its got a lamination crack in it
checking out the price a quarter
maybe i can get him down
you are one cheap bastard harvey
yeah i know im tight man but i live on a government wage
a skinny guy with a big nose glasses and a ratty trench coat taps harvey on the shoulder
he is soft spoken a bit shy and very odd a young robert crumb
you collect jay mcshann man
how bout you
yeah but most of my records are back in philly
a greaser type guy in a leather jacket pahls joins them
harv meet my buddy bob crumb
he just moved to town
hes an artist at american greeting card company
you should see his comics harv
they are outta sight
im into comics myself
a disheveled mess that gives new meaning to the term bachelor pad
records and books are strewn everywhere
so crumb showed me this comic book novel he was working on the big yum yum book
id never seen anything like it
harvey marches back and forth holding crumbs illustrated comic novel
crumb sits on the floor nursing a beer and sorting through vintage comic books
harveys bursting with so much enthusiasm its almost aggressive
its terrific man
i really dig your work
crumb ignores harveys praise
holding up a vintage comic this peter wheat book is by walt kelly
its pretty rare
can i get good bread for it
harvey flops down in an overstuffed chair
stuffing flies out
he sips his beer
listen man lets get back to your book
what are you gonna do with it
looking up i hadnt thought about it
its just an exercise
harvey flips through the book
its more than an exercise
its breaking ground man
theres some wild shit in here
crumb is immune to harveys enthusiasm
youre spitting on me harvey
crumb lies on the couch sketching while harvey reads more of the yum yum book
a scratchy jazz record plays
crumb and i hung out a lot back then
we had records and comics in common
we see crumb is actually sketching harvey slumped in a chair reading a book
crumb makes harvey look like a smelly sweaty madman with ratty clothing
crumb holds the sketch of harvey up to show him
laughing check it out man
harvey glances up at his portrait completely unselfconscious
yeah ya dont know the half of it
harvey goes back to reading
crumb back to sketching
eventually people got hip to crumbs art work and he started hangin out with a bohemian crowd
after a while he got sick of greeting cards and moved away to san francisco where he got the whole underground comic scene off the ground
crumb slowly evaporates from the room leaving harvey totally alone
hed come back ta cleveland every few years an peopled treat him like a celebrity
the record spins and spins
crumb drawing of harvey now circa on a sketch pad we see a deranged tormented harvey sitting alone on a park bench
he pulls at his hair and looks as though he may murder the next person who walks by
as the pencil adds shading to harveys face we hear once he came to visit when i was really feelin bad
it was right around the time of my throat operation an right after my second wife left me
at first it was pretty weird
i mean here my life was falling apart an everything was going great for him
i was on my second divorce an he was a big hit with the chicks
i was a nothin file clerk and he was this famous cartoonist
harvey and r
crumb sit on a park bench together by a bus stop
a distraught harvey whines while crumb just sketches
harveys voice is still raspy
i dunno man
on the one hand most women gettin graduate degrees wouldnt give a guy like me the time a day
an she married me an everything so i gotta give her some kinda credit
but then she got so mean to me in the end
an it aint like i tried tkeep her captive or anything like that yknow
crumb may or may not be listening to harvey
its hard to tell
an then on top of it i lost my voice for three months
i still sound like shit but before i had nothin
man talk about hell
i started forgettin what i sound like yknow
so i started writin stuff down stories an things my points a view ideas
i even published a couple jazz record reviews
i guess that ended up bein a good thing
but dont think i buy into this growth crap
everybody talks about how bad experiences can cause ya tgrow an all that cliched stuff
ive had enough bad experiences and growth to last me plenty
a beat right now id be glad to trade some growth for happiness
for a moment they both just sit there saying nothing to each other each man in his own private universe
finally harvey looks over to crumb
so how long are ya stayin in cleveland
crumb never looks up from his picture
i dunno man
i gotta go visit this chick in new york
and im really busy with the comic book stuff
its good bread and all man but im getting fed up with the whole scene
what are ya talkin about
yer makin a good living doin yer art
how many guys get that lucky in their life huh
yeah i dunno
ya know man people are startin to know the name crumb
when you croak youre gonna leave something behind
yeah my ashes and some crappy doodles
its not like im blind lemon jefferson or big mama thornton
it sure beats workin a gig like mine being a nobody flunky and sellin records on the side for a buck
yeah well thats true
harvey nods in agreement mulling this over
hes not at all offended
a hand reaches into the frame and opens the drawer
by rote harvey fumbles with a large stack of expired patient files
he places each into the appropriate alphabetical deceased drawer
attempting to grab another batch harvey accidentally knocks the entire pile onto the floor
he crouches down to survey the mess a collage of expired lives laid out before his eyes
we move past dozens of anonymous names william anderson louis collins mark damico tyrone moore franklin ray etc
each file has a red deceased stamp
depressed harvey is transfixed by the files surrounding him on the floor
suddenly he stops and picks one up
angle on folder it is marked charlie marshall
he opens the folder and reads the stats
born in cleveland died in cleveland occupation clerk angle on harvey he swallows hard as he reads about charlies small invisible and now vanished life
he tosses the folder back onto the pile
harvey sits at a table with a pen in hand and a blank sheet of paper in front of him
nothing seems to come to him
he flips through a pile of comic books everything from d
comic super heroes to underground works such as crumbs mr
natural and zap comix
harvey throws them down in frustration
harvey pushes a cart through the cramped aisles of a crowded supermarket
he pulls a few cans of beef a roni off the shelf and heads off to pay
reaching the check out area he evaluates the situation
there are three lines to choose from
two of the counters have long waits
the third is much shorter but there is an old jewish lady next in line
the left side of the frame remains harvey at the supermarket deliberating over the check out lines
however the right side of the frame now contains a crumb appears over cartoon harveys head revealing his thoughts
it reads pickin the right check out line is an art
theres a lot of things you gotta consider
on the left side of the frame
harvey decides to get behind the old lady
meanwhile on the right hand side of the frame
cartoon harvey stands behind the old lady
a new bubble reads it may be the shortest line but i am takin a chance cause shes an old jewish lady
back to the left side of the frame
the cashier rings up the old ladys purchases a few kitchen glasses
yiddish accent listen goily dese glasses are six for
because i couldnt carry twelf
but i vanted twelf so today im buying six more
but you should only charge me
its ok you can esk de meneger
harvey rolls his eyes and stamps his foot impatiently
he knows hes in trouble now
i need a price check
instead of still comic panels with balloons the cartoon harvey now rants directly into the camera
man old jewish ladies will argue forever with a cashier about anything
get behind them in a line an yer gonna wait forever
the human harvey seems oblivious to his cartoon replica
he impatiently leans on his cart waiting and seething
i mean im a yid myself an the women in my family are like that
but i never got used to it
i may be cheap but i got limits
on the left hand side of the screen
the manager finally arrives
the old lady haggles with him too
let me splain von more time
meanwhile on the right hand side
the cartoon harvey turns to address the human harvey who actually looks him in the eyes
it now seems human harvey can actually hear his cartoon alter ego
youre whole lifes gettin eaten away by this kinda crap
what kind of existence is this
is this all a workin stiff like you can expect
ya gonna suffer in silence fer the rest a yer life
or ya gonna make a mark
suddenly motivated by an odd notion harvey abandons his grocery cart and runs out of the supermarket
bursting with ideas harvey wearing his undershirt and boxers starts story boarding his first comic with stick figures
a bleary eyed harvey still clad in an undershirt and boxers dozes off over a bowl of corn flakes
on the table next to some spilled milk are a stack of papers covered with scribbling
he clearly has been slaving over this work all night
at the top is a quickly scribbled title standing behind old jewish ladies in supermarket lines
these are ad hoc versions of a comic book
the pages are divided like a tick tack toe board
each square is filled with crude stick figure drawings and lots of writing
an alarm clock goes off
harveys eyes fly open
harvey yawns then notices the pile of papers
he peruses them proud of his work
he gets up and looks out the window
it is yet another grey day in cleveland
the neighborhood is run down
garbage is strewn everywhere
the following scene unfolds through the window two unsightly workers lug an old smelly mattress from a garage towards the garbage cans on the curb
their conversation is distant but entirely audible
so how smart is she
i guess shes about average
average is dumb
they drop the mattress in place
with the window framing these guys the scene freezes looking just like a comic book panel
harvey turns around from the scene and ponders it
he moves back towards his pile of stick figure drawings
harvey scribbles the words american splendor at the top of the page
the following scene is shot through the restaurant window
we see reflections of people walking by
a tense harvey starts at crumb as he eats a burger and reads harveys mock ups
harvey doesnt touch his burger deluxe and nervously talks in his laryngitis afflicted voice
see ever since i read your stuff man ive been thinking i could write comic book stories that were different from anything being done
munching on a fry uh huh
im thinkin the guys who do animal comics and super hero stuff are really limited cause they gotta try to appeal to kids
and underground comics like yours have been really subversive or opened things up politically
but there is still plenty more ta be done with em too yknow
pass me the ketchup
i mean with pictures and words it could be more of an art form
like those french movies are
or de sica over in italy yknow
so i tried writin some things about real life
stuff the everymans gotta deal with
crumb finally looks up from harveys work
these are about you
you turned yourself into a comic hero
but no idealized shit
no phony bullshit
the real thing yknow
ordinary life is pretty complex stuff
crumb reads more
harvey waits anxiously
finally crumb starts to chuckle
these are really good harv
ya think so
crumb shuffles through more
this is great stuff man
i dig it
can i take them home and illustrate them
harvey is practically bursting
harveys voice breaks like a kid in puberty
he clears his throat
and something miraculous happens
when harvey opens his mouth to speak his laryngitis is gone
youd do that for me man
thatd be great
i cant draw a straight line
hey whats up with your voice harv
all of a sudden it sounds fine
thrilled i dont know man
i guess you cured me
harvey bounds towards the snack room where a group of hospital workers and patients hang out
he bangs on the window to get their attention
when they look up harvey waves a comic book in the air
guys scrawled across the top in big red letters reads american splendor
a mans finger points to the words all stories by harvey pekar
art by r
the comic book sits atop a table in the dreary snack room
a crowd of hospital workers patients doctors maintenance workers etc
under ten total gather around a proud harvey who shows off his work
for the first time he seems almost happy
beaming see that
all stories by yours truly
a wwii vet patient with a portable iv cranes to get a glimpse
hot off the presses huh
we got a regular hemingway here
no way jack i dont go in for that macho crap
doctor chimes in
i didnt know you could draw pekar
i dont draw
i just write the stories
a buddy of mine and some of his friends do the art work
toby the supernerd from the bus stop grabs the comic book off the table and peruses it
harvey am i in here
you promised i would be in here
youre in there alright
boats harveys philosophical co worker pushes his way thorough the crowd
he snatches the comic out of tobys hand
let me see this
boats its not polite to grab things
next time son you done good
ya know i was up in toronto a few weeks back an i saw the red chinese ballet
boats talks the crowd starts to disperse
now that was beautiful
the way those people were dancing together
those chinese work hard
i tell ya they work hard where is everybody goin
boats hands the comic book back to harvey and turns on his heels
through the window he notices two vets in wheelchairs moving down the hall
where these sickly men rushin off to
they aint goin nowhere for now
maybe not for a long time
but damn if they aint in a rush to get there
harvey stands there his moment of glory passed
but its okay
he flips through his comic and smiles
a motley group of guys hang out on a street corner in front of the association of polish women
harvey heads towards them
hey look guys here comes captain america
harvey rolls his eyes
yelling out you gonna hang with the boys now that yer a comic book star
harvey turns red
hes embarrassed but part of him loves the attention
cut it out
man i aint nothin yet compared to bob crumb
ah listen to him
one lousy comic book and he wants to be crumb
the guys laugh
a silent guy crouches by the wall reading his cleveland browns trading cards
hey harvey if ya wanna make comics for adults ya oughtta put some dirty stuff in it
yeah you can write about martys sex life
harvey hangs with the guys but he doesnt engage
he seems to be observing them more than interacting with them
i heard ya went out with bonnie yesterday
wudja git offa her
alls i got wuz armaround
the guys all stare at him for a moment
then they crack up
a marty look alike is bombarded with questions about his date with bonnie
he complains that all he got was arm around
the real harvey holds the above comic book in his hand
the stage is set with a few items that indicate a comic book store
harvey talks about a couple of american splendor issues and how they impacted his life recognition as a writer etc
he gives his philosophy about the comic book etc
a montage of american splendor covers issue harvey sits alone in his cubicle
he doodles stick figures on a pad some ideas for a new comic
his postures miserable
he rubs his temples like hes in anguish
heres our man eight comics later a brand new decade same old bullshit
yeah sure he gets lots of recognition for his writin now
sure his comics are praised by all the important media types tellin people what to think
but so what
its not like he makes a livin at it like bob crumb
he cant go an quit his day job or nothin
several shots of harvey just thinking scratching his face with a pencil tapping his foot nervously
each shot is separated by a second or two of black an homage to harveys wordless panels
finally he goes back to writing
who am i kiddin
truth is id be lost without my work routine
alone in bed harvey wakes up in a cold sweat from a nightmare
he looks horrified short of breath
calming himself down i got a job
i got a job
harvey scratches his head
harvey writes i got a job in a balloon over the stick figures head
so to stave off desperation and feelings of uselessness i resigned myself to a menial existence
but hey maybe the guy whos had a happy life feels worse just before he dies than th guy who had a sad one
or maybe not
maybe i just needed a woman
toby comes in decked out in plaid and stripes
he has an empty messenger bag
do you want these gourmet jelly beans
i gave up sweets for lent
harvey turns around
he seems down depressed
sure ill take em
toby watches harvey eat a few
thats pretty good
i recommend the pina coladas
they are excellent and very authentic tasting
toby heads down a file row and proceeds to take a few off the shelves stuffing his bag
harvey gets up and comes after him
hey toby can you eat lentils during lent
i dont see why not
you cant eat meat on certain days but lentils should be acceptable anytime
ya think theres any connection between lentils and lent
i dont think so but ill ask sister mary fred at church on sunday
sister mary fred huh
is she cute
sounds kinda mannish but who am i to be picky
harvey youre funny
shes a nun
maybe she became a nun because she couldnt get a guy
harvey she became a nun because she had a higher calling
that is such a crock of shit
i dont know why you waste your time prayin anyway
well harvey i like the ritual
and im a very spiritual person
you know you should try believing in something bigger than yourself
it might cheer you up
toby turns on his heels and walks off
calling after him what
do i seem depressed toby
toby doesnt respond
harvey shrugs and digs deep into the jelly bean bag
he pulls out a fistful
jellybeans in every imaginable color
harvey fingers a few and then picks a blue one
a few items from the previous scene are present on the sound stage indicating that its a set of american splendor the movie
the actor harvey stands alone his hand filled with jelly beans
okay that was great
the bakery scene is next
actor harvey steps out of the frame revealing a craft service table behind him
at the table the real harvey and the real toby load up on donuts
the two discuss the food on the set
ironically the real toby is actually more extreme than the actor who plays him even more robotic and completely incapable of eye contact
the real toby discusses the finer points of nerdom and evaluates the actors nerd quotient
the real harvey explains to actor toby that nothing not even gourmet jelly beans would have cheered him up at that point in his life
he was too lonely and depressed
light pours through the curtained window
naked and disheveled harvey tosses and turns in bed
my loneliness was unbearable man
weekends were the worst
sometimes in my sleep id feel a body next to me like an amputee feels a phantom limb
extreme wide shot a city street overpass spans across the entire frame
the lone figure of harvey sulks there in the middle watching traffic pass below
sure my comics were bringin me notoriety but my personal life was in shambles
i thought a little attention would make me feel better
it only made me feel worse
it is a beautiful sunny day
the trees are in bloom
theres the first scent of spring in the air
kids play in the street
music pours out of passing cars
everyone seems to have a smile on his or her face except harvey
he walks on the shadowy side of the street
establishing shot of harvey trudging into the bakery
a couple of women order bread and cookies from two counter harvey surveys the donuts
yelling to harvey next
to the counter girl yeah
ill have two crullers a jelly donut with powdered sugar
and you got any day old bread
a woman with attractive irish looks brushes past harvey on her way to the door
this is alice quinn roughly harveys age but there is a tired weary look in her eyes
hey youre harvey pekar
half in a daze harvey stares at the chick
harvey studies her face
suddenly it clicks
we had a couple lit classes together
harvey pays and receives his items
they step back towards the door
what happened to you
you just disappeared after one semester
harvey scratches his armpit
i know man
i got good grades and all but there was this required math class
i cant do math an that required class hangin over my head made me crazy
eventually the pressure got to be too much
well youre doing okay anyway
i heard all about your jazz reviews and your comics
this perks harvey up
sure youre famous
meanwhile i got my degree but im just a plain old wife and mother
harvey stares at her wedding ring
his face drops
im not doing as great as ya think
my second wife divorced me and i work at a dead end job as a file clerk
sometimes i hang out with the guys on the corner but most of the time i just stay home by myself and read
youre luckier than you think
my husband and kids make it impossible for me to cuddle up with a good book
harvey and alice continue their conversation as they stroll towards her car
im reading this book by dreiser now thats one of my favorites
i hope it dont end like so many a those naturalist novels
with someone getting crushed ta earth by forces he cant control
i think youll be pleasantly surprised
its certainly not a hollywood happy ending but its pretty truthful
which is rare these days
this hits home with harvey
he cant believe hes made such a connection with this woman
alice stops in front of a beat up station wagon
this is me
i dont have one yet
can i give ya a lift somewhere
its a nice day
ill just walk
harvey looks down a little sad
well we should have you over sometime for dinner
sure id be glad tcome
but if you really wanna do me a favor introduce me to some a your single girlfriends
i bet theyre all smart like you
im no catch though so ill take anything you can get me
alice pecks harvey on the cheek
ill work on it
she gets into the car
nice seeing ya harvey
harvey watches as she drives off
when i got home i finished reading jennie gerhardt
it was real good way better than i expected
that alice wuz right
the room is moody dark and lonely
the shadowy figure of harvey sits on the floor devouring jennie gerhardt
sure lester the main character croaks in the end but at least hes old and dies a natural dignified death
the camera travels around the room to find harvey again now silhouetted in the door frame still clutching the book and obsessed by his thoughts
i was more alone that weekend than any
all i did was think about jennie gerhardt an alice quinn an all the decades of people i have known
the camera travels again to find harvey sitting on a chair in the corner of his room
his head is bowed
his shoulders slump over as if hes struggling with something weighty
the more i thought the more i felt like cryin life seemed so sweet an so sad an so hard tlet go of in the end
the camera travels a final time to find harvey sprawled across his couch
but hes not asleep hes still obsessing
the book lies on his chest like a lover
close up of harveys troubled face
beneath the pain we see hope and determination
but hey man
every days a brand new deal right
just keep on workin and sumpns bound ta turn up
an urban comic book shop on a dicey but bohemian street
a title over picture reads meanwhile in delaware
joyce brabner a depressive nudge with a perpetually peptic expression frantically searches the store for something
her partner a granola type named rand finishes unloading a stack on the shelf
what happened to the new american splendor
we sold em babe
all of them
accusatory damn it
i put one aside for myself next to the register
i didnt even get a chance to read it
whoa sorry joyce
i didnt know you were such a splendor fan
next time take it home
joyce leans against the counter
she pushes up her glasses and looks really upset
maybe ill call the publisher
but they take so damn long
why does everything in my life have to be such a complicated disaster
joyce starts slamming things around the store
finally rand grabs his stuff
okay im gonna hustle before the vibe in here gets any worse
joyce barely notices still brewing
the mess in this room rivals harveys
a few cats add to the clutter
joyce lies on her disheveled bed and writes a letter
greetings from the second smallest state in the union an endless plastics and nylon plantation controlled by giant chemical corporations
harvey takes his mail out of the box
he finds an oddly decorated envelope
to make matters more dismal there are no decent comic book stores in my town which is why my partner and i opened one ourselves
harvey finishes reading the letter sitting on the toilet
a cat runs around him
despite our steadily faltering business my partner managed to sell the last copy of american splendor out from under me
im a big fan and i hate to wait for a new order
is there any way i can get it from you direct
sincerely joyce brabner
harvey scratches his head
he mutters to himself
man shes got good lookin handwritin
we see harvey in his bed writing
dear joyce thanks for the letter
whattya do besides sellin comics
we see joyce standing in front of a group of prisoners
im a sometime activist and i teach writing to prisoners
i try to help them build an interior life and make art out of their monotonous suffocating routine
harvey scribbles a letter while riding on the bus
so you married or what
joyce empties her can of cat food in a plate and slides it towards her kitty
im divorced thank god
now we see harvey full screen in bed in his underwear talking on the phone
hes clipping his toe nails
look i think you an i got a lot in common
how am i gonna get you to come visit me in cleveland
you think thats a good idea
its a great idea
you should meet me cause im a great guy
despite the way my comics read i got a lot of redeeming characteristics
he clips off a big one
joyce sits on her equally disheveled bed dunking a tea bag
her hair is wet from a shower
i dont know
where would i stay
dont worry im not gonna put no moves on you or anything
im not worried about that
fumbling with a tea cup hold on i just spilled chamomile tea all over my bathrobe
so what are ya worried about then
joyce sighs and lies down
a variety of american splendors are across her bed
different interpretations of harvey stare up at her
sipping well the way all those different artists draw you i dont quite know what to expect
i mean sometimes you look like a younger brando but then the way crumb draws you like a hairy ape with all those stinky wavy lines radiating off your body
its kind of scary
those are motion lines
im an active guy
anyway just come out here an ill try to be anyone you want me ta be
joyce smiles for the first time
thats a dangerous offer
im a notorious reformer
a nervous joyce walks off the plane into the arrivals area
she scans the crowd of friends family lovers and limo drivers waiting to meet the disembarking passengers
where is harvey
what will he look like
as joyce surveys the unfamiliar faces she imagines different versions of an animated illustrated harvey among the people
she double takes as sees the r
crumb harvey hairy scary smelly and picking his nose
joyce rubs her eyes
next she sees the brando harvey gary dumm but unfortunately he disappears fast
disappointed joyce notices the realistic drew friedman harvey walking towards her
she smiles as he dissolves into hey
are you joyce
joyce turns around
the flesh and blood harvey pekar stands before her not quite as bad as the crumb version not quite as good as the dumm version but still acceptable
she sighs with relief
we finally meet in person
she politely offers her hand
harvey shakes it but he looks overwhelmed worried and pessimistic
look before we get started with any of this ya might as well know right off the bat
i had a vasectomy
joyce lets go of his hand
she stares at him in disbelief
the most awkward date in history
seated in an ultra yuppie restaurant filled with business lunchers harvey and joyce hide behind their menus
while everyone else looks slick and successful these two compete for the worlds worst posture
yer lookin around everywhere
i guess i never imagined you eating in a place like this
i never been here
i thought youd like it
but obviously ya dont do ya
what difference does it make
harvey shakes his head feeling more pessimistic
none i guess
beat they sure got a lot of meat on this menu
youre a vegetarian
i mean ever since i got a pet cat i couldnt eat animals anymore
joyce grabs a bread stick
i support and identify with groups like peta but unfortunately im a self diagnosed anemic
also i have all these food allergies to vegetables that give me serious intestinal distress
i guess i have a lot of borderline health disorders that limit me politically when it comes to eating
harvey just stares at her
yer a sick woman huh
but i expect to be
everyone in my familys got some kind of degenerative illness
a cheery waitress bounces over
sing song good afternoon
im your server cindy
what can i bring you two today
they slowly look up at her
joyce and harvey enter the apartment
the place is a mess as usual
look i was gonna clean up but why should i give you any false notions
the truth is i got a serious problem with cleanliness
i could wash a dish ten times and itd still dirty
they even kicked me outta the army cause i couldnt learn ta make a bed
joyce puts down her bag
ive seen worse
she slumps down on the sofa as if shes been here a million times
she rubs her head
harvey sits next to her
harvey go get me water and a few aspirin
harvey just bounces back up and obeys
what ya got a headache
no but i want to avoid one
harvey empties the aspirin bottle in his palm
for some reason hes feeling more comfortable
well lemme tell ya joyce it sure is nice ta have company
i mean despite all your problems you seem like a great person
an hey sorry if my dating skills are kinda rusty but ive just been through hell and back with women
i mean that last one turned out to be a real nasty bitch
harvey arrives back with the aspirin
he hands it to joyce
i had a nice time with you too
joyce swallows the pill
harvey sits down next to her
you had a nice time
dont make people repeat themselves
theyre inches away from each other
she pulls him close
harvey plants a kiss on her
they slowly separate
joyces eyes are closed
she likes him
he kisses her again
they start making out moaning a bit
but before it gets heavy harvey
joyce opens her eyes
she looks uneasy
which doors the bathroom
harvey stands by the bathroom door despondent
from inside we hear the sounds of moaning and flushing
what is it
joyce is doubled over on the toilet
shes looking green
i dont know
i think that yuppie food did me in
i feel terrible
lemme at least do something for you
joyce gets to her feet and puts her glasses back on
she picks up a can and sprays air freshener around the room
then she looks at the can and realizes its wd
can i make ya something
how about some chamomile tea
joyce puts the can down
what the hells a guy like you doing with that
i thought you drink soda pop for breakfast
i noticed you drank a lot of it when we started talkin on the phone
so i stocked up on herbal teas for your visit
joyce turns her head to the door
shes truly surprised by what harveys just said
and very moved
she smiles to herself
harvey stands there waiting
the girl at the food co op picked me out all kinds of herbal stuff
one of ems good for stomachaches
grandma bears tummy mint i think
are you still there
joyce slowly opens the door
she leans against the door frame like shes just been through a war
she takes off her glasses and cleans them off with her shirt
harvey we better skip this whole courtship thing and just get married
harvey and joyce are in bed lying in each others arms
they look quite contented
man am i glad i talked you into comin up here
any more time alone and i mighta lost it fer good
so you dont have any problems with movin to cleveland
i find most american cities depressing in the same way
an yer okay with the vasectomy thing
harvey approaches the building
instead of dragging his feet like usual he seems to be floating on a cloud
we havent seen harvey this happy since
well since never
he stops by a junker car and peeks in the window finding toby eating lunch alone
he has an entire white castle smorgasbord spread across the front seat
harvey knocks on the window
toby rolls it down
mouth full no you cant have any of my white castle hamburgers so please dont even ask
can i have a fry
harvey reaches for a handful of tobys fries
okay but just a couple harvey
im not going to eat dinner until very late and this has got to hold me over
harvey leans in always amused by toby
he steals another fry
munching whattya got a church function
no im driving to toledo to see a movie
would you like to come
i gotta fly to delaware tonight
im gettin married
the chick im marryin is from wilmington
plus i gotta help her move her stuff here
a beat why you drivin ta toledo to see a movie
its not playing at the mapletown
a beat i didnt know you had a girlfriend harvey
we met last week
harvey opens the car door and slides in with toby
toby what movie could possibly be worth drivin miles round trip for
its a new film called revenge of the nerds
its about a group of nerd college students who are being picked on all the time by the jocks so they decide to take revenge
i already saw it once
wow ya really dig this movie
i like it a lot harvey
what are these nerds like
how would you describe them
nerds are smart but they look and act differently than other people
like nerds might wear polyester button down shirts and flood pants where their ankles and their socks are showing
toby spills some catsup on his polyester button down shirt
he stands up to get a napkin revealing his flood pants
so what yer sayin is you identify with those nerds
rubbing out the catsup yes i consider myself a nerd
and this movie has uplifted me
theres this one scene where a nerd grabs the microphone during a pep rally and announces that he is a nerd and that he is proud of it and stands
up for the rights of other nerds
then he asks the kids at the pep rally who think they are nerds to come forward
so nearly everyone in the place does
thats the way the movie ends
so the nerds won huh
harvey grabs the rest of tobys fries and opens the door to leave
you got this movie an im gettin hitched
we both had a good month huh
finishing his last burger right
harvey how long are you going to be in delaware because id really like to see this movie with you
im only goin for a week but then ill have a wife so ill have to take her along
is it a girl flick
depends on the girl
what kind of girl is your new bride
is she a nerd
i dont know man
shes into herbal teas
toby watches harvey saunter off
he returns to his last hamburger
a brightly lit marquee reads revenge of the nerds
the doors to the theater open and a crowd pours onto the street
harvey joyce and toby are among them
toby proudly wears a genuine nerd button on his striped shirt
i agree with toby
i think its a story of hope and tolerance
its about time that the people who get picked on get to be the heroes
harvey scrunches his face in disbelief
its an entertaining flick an i can see why you like it toby but those people on the screen aint even supposed to be you
theyre college students whose parents live in big houses in the suburbs
theyre gonna get degrees get good jobs and stop being nerds
joyce hits harvey
harvey what did i say about loud talking
use your inside voice
whispering loudly look toby the guys in that movie are not year old file clerks who live with their grandmothers in an ethnic ghetto
thats enough harvey
they didnt get their computers like you did by trading in a bunch of box tops and
at the supermarket
joyce folds her arms in disapproval
toby starts to laugh
youre funny harvey
harvey looks at him disappointed
he shakes his head
go to the movies and daydream but revenge of the nerds aint reality
its just hollywood bullshit
toby and joyce continue to analyze the movie in the front seat as toby starts the ignition
slouched grumpy and alone on the back seat harveys still annoyed by the movie
okay maybe i was bein so harsh on toby onna count a my own problems
ysee i wasnt even married a month and my old lady was already showin signs a trouble
granted i tend ta get married fast cause ill take any woman thatll have me but this time i really met my match
a few items indicating film production are in the frame
at a table in the foreground bob the director discusses the character of joyce with the actress playing her
the actress just nods as the director goes on
we can see the real joyce sitting with the real harvey in the distance
okay i think the thing with joyce is that as manic as harvey can be she matches him with depression
in that way they complete each other
i mean shes obviously a very smart woman but she has a lot of trouble functioning in a world she cant control
and shes totally obsessed with all things negative yknow diseases dysfuctions etc
the real joyce and real harvey listen curiously sometimes pleased sometimes displeased as their personalities are dissected and boiled down to a few phrases
the real joyce puts in her two cents about the actress playing her
she rants about what its like to be portrayed in a movie and having a character arc imposed on her life
she moves into talking about her relationship with harvey and the first years of their marriage how impossible it was to live with him
the real harvey just rolls his eyes
joyce is on a cleaning rampage
she rummages through piles upon piles of records while harvey paces nervously
what about these s harvey
cant you sell them to one of those collectors
are ya kidding
no way man
i aint getting rid of my s
joyce throws down the records in frustration
harvey runs over to check if theyre scratched
angry forget it then
i give up
how can i make more storage space if you wont get rid of anything
ill get rid of stuff
just not my good stuff
everythings your good stuff
how am i supposed to live here if theres no room for me
aw come on baby
ill make room for ya
you just have to give me time
im not so good at these kind of things
thats because youre obsessive compulsive harvey
a door buzzer rings
harvey slams it to unlock the front
i dont wanna hear that psychobabble crap
i dont care if you wanna hear it or not
youre the poster child for the dsm iii
ill have you know that i come from a very dysfunctional family
i can spot personality disorders a mile away
a knock on the door interrupts their argument
joyce storms away to answer it
joyce opens it to face a smiling toby dressed as usual in a loud polyester fashion dont
he talks in his strange robotic voice and avoids all eye contact
is harvey home
joyce turns to harvey and points to toby
this scene shrinks into a square up in the corner
the next few scenes neurosis montage further divide up the full screen like a comic book
crumb leaps from behind an autograph table where hes signing comics to hop on the back of zaftig babe who offers him a piggy back ride
joyce turns to harvey
joyce picks up harvey from work
harvey enters the car waving goodbye to the ranting mr
she points to mr
paranoid personality disorder
the telephone rings
a disheveled tired looking joyce flips through a novel and lets the machine pick up
please leave a message
beep into phone hey joyce its me
youre not gonna believe this but some la producer called an he wants to do a play about my life
click joyce flips the page
to herself delusions of grandeur
end neurosis montage return to full screen harvey and joyce sit in a packed theater watching a play
joyce looks exhausted
a stage actor harvey and a stage actor joyce share a couch on the sparse stage
see i think comics can be an art form
with pictures an words a guy can do pretty much anything
thats true harvey
but i didnt come all the way from delaware to talk about comics
the stage actor joyce lunges over and plants a kiss on him
harvey digs it but joyce looks disgusted
we now see stage actor harvey clutching a tea cup as stage actor joyce kneels before a toilet bowl
off to the side of the stage a spot light illuminates a guitar player who adds music to the scene
harvey and joyce walk through the terminal
harvey brims with energy but joyce looks exhausted
if ya think readin comics about yer life seems strange try watchin a play about it
god only knows how ill feel when i see this movie
but truth be told the play wasnt half bad and we got a free trip outta it
things were goin pretty good for a change
variety called me the blue collar mark twain and doubleday was interested in publishing an anthology of american splendor
harvey nervously taps his foot as he waits for the bags
joyce leans against the carousel staring at a young mother with a baby in a bjorn
i hate checkin bags man
it always takes forever
he checks his watch
joyce remains quiet and distant
jesus look at the time
the bus is gonna leave soon and there wont be another one for an hour
that means i gotta shell out an extra thirty bucks for a cab
harvey spots a bag that he thinks is his
hey wait theres our a well dressed man grabs it figures
that lucky yuppies gonna get on the bus in time
suddenly joyce mumbles something to harvey
yknow harvey vasectomies are reversible
ignoring her damn yuppies get everything
raising her voice are you listening to me
i said vasectomies are reversible
whattya talkin about
i dont want kids
an i came clean about my vasectomy the first time i set eyes on ya right here in this airport
more heads turn
i know but things have changed
i think we can be a family
what kinda family could we possibly be
i aint no good with kids
i can barely take care of myself
ill take care of the kid and you
dead serious no way joyce
i cant do it i cant have no kids
joyce folds her arms
the audience of eavesdroppers looks disappointed as well
if the place was a disaster before believe it or not its gotten worse
joyce seems to have given up on her organizing
and everything else for that matter
harvey hysterically searches through the mess for a record album
joyce just lies listlessly on an open futon on the middle of the room it looks as if she hasnt been up in days
where the hell is that ornette coleman album joyce
i got a review due tomorrow
joyce rolls over
i didnt touch it harvey
would you let me sleep
but its one oclock
how late can a person sleep
joyce sits up
this time she means business
it happens to be saturday you selfish sonofabitch
and dont you go telling me what to do
im the one who moved into your city into your home into your vasectomy and into your screwed up life
the least you could do is allow me to live here my way
she rolls over and covers her head with the pillow
harvey just stands there staring at her
i tried everything but nothin could get this woman outta bed
harvey peruses the aisles
he pulls box upon box of herbal tea off the shelves
i mean she wouldnt get a job wouldnt go out wouldnt make friends nothin
harvey throws boxes of herbal teas at joyce as she sprawls listlessly on the futon
she just yawns and turns over on her side
joyce diagnosed herself as clinically depressed
i dont know what the hell she was goin through but it was sure takin its toll on me
a frustrated harvey tries once more to cheer her up
upbeat we can go out for dinner tonight
how bout catching a bite at tommys
mumbling im not hungry
harvey throws his hands in the air and walks off
i give up
as he passes the answering machine he notices its blinking
hey joyce we got a message here
why didnt you pick up
joyce doesnt respond
he presses the play button
angle on answering machine a loud beep then
hi this is a message for harvey pekar
my name is jonathan greene and im a producer for late night with david letterman
wed like to talk to you about coming on the show to plug your comics
please give me a call at
what the hell
joyce sits up
harveys finger hits the replay button
hi this is a message for harvey the impressive skyline glistens in the spring sun
joyce finally got off the futon
armed with shopping bags from bleecker bobs record shop the strand book store and forbidden planet comic book emporium harvey and joyce eat lunch on a park bench
harvey chomps on a knish and watches oddball new yorkers stroll by as joyce nibbles on her hot dog
cut back to reveal harvey schlepping an ice bucket down a hall in his underwear
a female business traveler passes and stares at him
he enters a room with a do not disturb sign
the pekars have already wreaked havoc on their luxury hotel room
it looks like a tornado touched down on the new york hilton
harvey tries on outfits for the big show
he pulls a wrinkled t shirt over his head and models it for joyce who is spread out on the bed surrounded by piles of clothing scissors and sewing supplies
she glances up at harveys getup and shakes her head no
who the hell cares
harvey tosses his shirt over to joyce who snatches it and starts cutting it with a scissor
hey whattya doin
she resumes her mysterious sewing project she seems to be making some kind of doll
backstage joyce watches late night with david letterman on a monitor as harvey awaits his turn to go on camera
he has changed out of his wrinkled t shirt into a slightly more formal look a denim shirt and a ratty seersucker striped jacket
a s david letterman wisecracks
neither joyce nor harvey look particularly impressed with the whole deal
people like this show
im gettin hungry back here
they oughtta leave ya donuts or somethin
a nervous stage manager wearing a headset peeks his head in
daves ready for you now mr
hey you got anything ta eat
my stomachs growling
checking his watch theres no time to eat now
harvey glances at the monitor just as letterman announces his next guest
our next guest works as a file clerk in a cleveland hospital
the stage manager grabs harvey by the arm
joyce stops them
wait a minute
wheres the doll
hes got it at the desk
will you relax about that already
guys guys were in a hurry here
the stage manager physically pushes harvey out of the green room
joyce turns back to face the monitor
letterman holds up a copy of a full size glossy american he also writes comic books which detail his day to day pains and pleasures and this is an anthology
of nine of those comics
its entitled american splendor
from off the streets of cleveland please say hello to harvey pekar
portraying him but rather the real harvey pekar only about years younger
this is actual stock footage from harveys joyce watches as harvey shakes lettermans hand and takes a seat
he smiles as the audience warmly greets him
it seems harveys grooving on this attention
but as soon as the audience quiets down harvey turns to his host and starts his offensive im ready for those cleveland jokes
taken off guard letterman laughs
alright settle down harvey
the audience laughs now lets explain to folks who may not be familiar with your work what it is you do here exactly
you have comic books about you in your daily life in cleveland
and are they embellished at all or is it pretty much factual
its all true david
and you also have a regular job in cleveland working at a hospital
aiding the sick yes
aiding the sick
well thats certainly noble work
unimpressed such brilliant repartee
now it seems to me harvey that you have a very successful career here
this is being published by a major publishing company doubleday
why do you maintain the day job
defensive to make a living
big laughs i dont make a living as a writer
ive been writing for many years david
maybe more years than youve been alive
now letterman cracks up
a letterman regular tony randall
comes in with some food
he stops by the monitor to watch a moment with joyce
yeah i know that my youthful appearance belies you know my actual age
but ive been around for a long time to joyce you know this guy
im beginning to wonder
the letterman regular takes a seat as he watches the monitor
he seems more intrigued than joyce
but i have a feeling though if you wanted to you could probably get by on what you make selling your work
because i know people are after you to write other things
youre publishing this anthology
this hits a sore spot
harvey goes from politely condescending to cantankerous in one second flat
what are you talking about
where the hell do you get that stuff
letterman cracks up
the audience laughs even harder
im no show biz phoney
im telling the truth
come on man
the audience cant believe this guys holding his own with letterman
to joyce at least hes keeping up with letterman
pandering is more like it
suddenly joyce walks over to the monitor and looks for the channel
she hits a button but it only changes the frame of the show
excuse me but what are you doing
im trying to get some news
you know theres a big story about to break about the us selling arms to iran and the contras
thats a monitor
just forget it
joyce gives up
she sinks back into her seat and pulls a book from her bag
the letterman regular stares at her like shes from mars
harvey i know youve got a job
ive got a job
were both very lucky
we both have jobs
then whats the matter
once again laughs and a big round of applause
letterman pulls out joyces mysterious doll and props it up on the table
weve gotta go
harvey i like you
im on your side
i enjoy the comic books
and here quickly tell us about the little doll here
my wife made it
she suddenly perks up
finally something good
to letterman regular watch this
it is an absolutely horrific but oddly evocative harvey rag doll
his face is inspired by crumbs drawings of harvey but even more extreme
his little t shirt reads american splendor
the audience is in stitches
theyre made out of your old clothing
and what do these go for
thirty four bucks
shocked thirty four dollars
thirty four dollars for this
what are ya cheap
you cheaper than me
would you pay thirty four dollars for that
no but im not asking it
my wife is
joyce stares at the monitor expressionless
the stage manager sticks his head in
hes a natural
the stage manager grabs the regular
a smiling harvey the actor now waltzes in straight from his command performance
joyce taps her finger on lettermans image on the monitor
harvey tries on a ripped t shirt for joyce who lies on the bed
it became clear pretty fast that i was invited on the show just for laughs
but what the hell did i care
letterman was an okay guy
let him take pot shots at me slong as i got paid an got to plug my comics
montage a series of actual harvey appearances on late night joyce whose different outfits reflect time passage watches each time from the green room
letterman show stock footage harvey in a ratty t shirt spars with letterman
harvey you are the embodiment of the american dream
the audience laughs
funny thing is somethin about me and letterman clicked for the viewers
he kept wantin me back
letterman introduces his favorite guest
it is my pleasure to welcome back our next guest the lovable harvey pekar
harvey walks out with a box of donuts
he starts giving letterman an earful right off the bat
here was this slick ambitious guy with millions winnin over the country by makin light of everything
and then there was me
a messy loser with no dough who takes everything too seriously
tell me harvey what do you do to get away from the pressure of being well a file clerk
laughter go ahead and laugh folks
but he has more contempt for you than i do
the burger joint has been transformed into a film set with lights cameras and lots of trendy mtv types
an it wasnt just me gettin all the attention
as a result of my appearances on letterman my buddy toby radloff landed a gig on mtv extolling the virtues of white castle burgers
two hot babes slave over toby as he gets his hair and make up done
harvey wanders onto the set
he finally spots toby in the corner
as he heads over to say hello harvey bumps into the mtv director a new wave fashion victim who looks like a lost member of a flock of seagulls
watch where youre going
muttering fuckin yuppie or whatever kinda freak you are
that day on the set with those mtv jerks i had an epiphany
it seemed that real salt of the earth people like toby an me were bein coopted by these huge corporations
we were gettin held up and ridiculed as losers in the system
what can i say it was the s man
toby dressed in dark sunglasses and a turtleneck stands in front of a white castle
he delivers his lines in his trademark robotic style
theres an mtv logo on the bottom of the screen
hamburgers are a safer addiction than drugs
say no to drugs
say yes to white castle
harvey and joyce eat breakfast together
harvey reads a katherine mansfield book as joyce reads a newspaper
looking up from the paper harvey ive been reading about these kids who grew up in war zones
palestinians israelis el salvadorians cambodians
these kids are amazing and theyre a yuppie in a jogging suit walks up to harvey interrupting joyce in mid sentence
hey youre that guy from the letterman show right
smiling yeah thats me
thats so excellent
you and stupid pet tricks are a riot
harveys not smiling anymore
this guys a jerk
then why dontcha buy one of my comics man
thats the only reason i go on that dumb show anyway
later harvey pekar
the yuppie rushes out
anyway i want to do a political comic book about these kids
theres a conference in jerusalem in a few weeks and i can start by doing interviews there
whoa whoa wait a second
i can barely drag you off the futon to go to the letterman show
cause i dont give a damn about the letterman show
i want to work on something important to me
something that matters
joyce hits a nerve
you know i only go on the show for the extra bread
people start to look over
maybe if you got yer lazy ass up and got a job i could work on something that matters too huh
joyce doesnt dignify harvey with an answer
she stares at him her eyes well with hurt
he sighs calming down
he looks around sheepishly
im sorry baby
i im sorry
he grabs her hand
harvey and joyce stroll across the lawn holding hands
they move towards a waiting cab
harvey carries his wifes bags
i guess it was good ta finally see joyce excited about somethin of her own
sure i was happy for her
but i was still upset for me
they stop by the cab
this is crazy
cant ya just do somethin here in cleveland
harvey youll survive a few weeks alone
i love you baby
harvey grudgingly puts her bags in the car
he watches as the cab pulls away
it was later that night when i first found the lump
wearing only his shorts harvey lies alone in the communal futon flipping through a book
he reaches into his underwear to scratch his nuts
suddenly he stops
he feels something odd
for a moment he just freezes
his eyes register panic
i was determined to put it outta my mind until joyce got back
easier said than done
an enraged harvey fights with his co worker miguel
what do i care
just gimme the chart already
what is your problem today
i just dont wanna keep comin back here for it okay
harvey that patients due tbe admitted a week from now
why do you always have to be picking fights with everybody
yelling how many times do we gotta go through the same bullshit
just gimme the fuckin chart
offended miguel storms off
well see what the doctor says about this
alone and slumped over his table harvey draws comic ideas with stick figures
nothings coming to him
he looks like hes in anguish
frustrated harvey crumbles the idea and throws it on the floor
he knocks over a chair
he tosses and turns in bed
no way hes sleeping
harvey is yelling into the telephone
it is a bad connection
loudly into phone whadya mean
another two weeks
ya gotta come home some time
without joyce a surly harvey waits in the wings for his introduction
he sneaks a peek as letterman finishes up the stupid pet tricks segment
we hear dogs barking and audience laughter
and there you have it folks
another enlightening episode of stupid pet tricks
i was startin ta lose it
between the lump the loneliness i felt like everything wuz closin in on me
and with joyce over there savin the world i never felt more like a sell out hack in my life
yknow ladies and gentlemen when thoreau wrote that most men lead lives of quiet depression he obviously had not met our first guest who happens to lead a life of
harvey clenches his fists
threatening okay asshole
youll pay for that one
harvey takes off his shirt
he pulls another t shirt out of the bag and changes
ladies and gentlemen please welcome back harvey pekar
harveys new t shirt reads on strike against nbc
he takes off for the stage fists clenched a soldier marching off to war
were positioned behind the monitor so we can only hear the show
the stage manager and two production assistants straighten up in the room
you wanna know what my politics are
im a strident leftist dave
i could have guessed half of that
you coulda guessed all of it man
so why dont we talk about your parent company g
lets talk about anti trust violations and nuclear reactors
joe put more sodas in the fridge there
and lets clean up the counters
that pekar guys a pig
as the p
s walk back and forth in front of the monitor we hear the letterman pekar banter grow louder
suddenly production assistant stops and checks out the monitor
check this out
toby and his grandmother watch harvey raise hell on letterman
again we cant see the screen
youre a cop out letterman
youre nothin but a shill for g
tobys grandmother passes him a plate of cookies
first of all harvey what you are saying is not true
second of all this is not the place to say it
if you want to talk about this go somewhere else because youre not talking about it here
dressed in a bathrobe mr
boats eats a lonely late night snack cake and milk at his kitchen table
a tv on the table has harvey and dave on
dont worry dave
i wont come back unless you beg me
youre not coming back at all
what do i care because weve given you many many chances to talk about things that would be of general interest to people so what
boats shakes his head
we see harvey alone slumped in the back seat of a town car heading back towards his hotel
city lights pass over his troubled face
we still hear the show as if its now in his head
and also to promote your little mickey mouse magazine
your little weekly reader
but youve blown every chance youve got
youre a dork harvey
dave youre fulla shit
youre fulla shit
the cover depicts a snarling letterman yelling you fucked up a great thing
at a smirking self satisfied harvey
joyce lies in bed reading the comic chuckling
harvey cuddles up against her
i guess you did it this time
he wasnt helpin my sales anyway
moving closer baby dont go away anymore
i just cant take bein alone
joyce puts the magazine down
if you met those kids over there and saw what they go through you wouldnt ask that of me
but if you go again im really gonna lose it
its not open for discussion harvey
i need this in my life right now
she cuddles up close to him
but i do appreciate the fact that you missed me so much
she starts to kiss him
he kisses her back
her hands wander down
suddenly she feels something strange
harvey what is that
harvey looks at her and gulps
harvey and joyce sit in the office holding hands like two terrified high school kids
a doctor stands before them
they just got bad news
i dont understand does tumor mean the same thing as cancer
the doctor gently nods
joyce covers her mouth
harvey holds onto his head
he looks positively dizzy
the doctor starts to talk yet the words dont seem to match his mouth
he looks dubbed
strange phrases just weave together echo and bounce off the wall making no sense at all
we know the growth is malignant
what we dont know is how far it may have spread
once we have the results of the biopsy we can make more informed decisions about treatment
blah blah blah
the whole office seems to spin
joyce and harvey sit on the stoop of their apartment house in a daze
the words keep echoing around them
harvey holds his head
how can i have cancer
i dont feel sick at all
thats a positive thing
my cousin norman died of lymphoma
he was twenty nine
he was a brilliant oncologist
youre not going to die harvey
harvey turns to joyce
whats going to happen to you baby
whos gonna take care of you if im not around
joyce stands up determined
harvey look at me and focus
we are going to get through this
i understand illness
i know how to handle these things
but thats you
im not strong enough
i dont know how ta be positive
i cant do it
yes you can
and ill tell you how
youll make a comic book out of the whole thing
youll document every little detail
and that way youll remove yourself from the experience until its over
despite joyces passionate pitch harvey shakes his head
i cant do that
im just not strong enough
i just wanna die
joyce folds her arm
ill do it without you
harvey and joyce lay there quietly both exhausted
joyce turns over so her back faces harvey
he puts his arm around her
a tear drips down her cheek
joyce is straightening up the apartment
the place actually looks halfway decent
joyce opens the door
a guy in his s named fred hells angels tough guy meets sensitive artist stands at the door
hes accompanied by a seven year old girl danielle
hey im fred
you called me about the comic book
right the artist
come on in
this is my daughter danielle
i had to bring her along
i hope you dont mind
joyce leans down and addresses the girl who holds a toy horse
whats that youre holding
its immediately obvious that joyce is great with kids
whats his name
shes a girl
oh i see
well im joyce
nice to meet both you and clarissa
they all walk towards the table which is covered with papers
im really sorry to hear about harvey
is he here
hes going to work until next week when he starts the chemo
thats why i wanna get this project started now
once hes stuck here i know hell take over
miserable and in a daze harvey walks up to his front door
he looks like a man whose days are numbered
when he reaches the door he searches his pockets for keys
harveys hand comes up empty
harvey tries the doorknob but its locked
he steps back on the lawn and looks around
could he have dropped them
he retraces a few steps
harvey yells up at the window
joyce open the door
i lost my keys again
harveys elderly neighbor struggles with her shopping cart through the door
harvey pushes past her to get in
harvey knocks again
now he punches the door
open the fucking door
suddenly the door opens
loud music pours out
but its not joyce its fred the artist
harvey just stares at him
fred opens the door to reveal joyce and danielle dancing together with the stereo blasting
theyre having a ball
at the kitchen table harvey looks over freds sketches
joyce and danielle are now building a house of cards on the living room floor
here are some ideas we batted around
joyce doesnt know what shes doing
theres too many words in these frames
when are ya comin back
uh she said something about next tuesday which is fine with me
only thing is i might have the kid again
my ex wifes supposed to take her but i dont have much faith in her showing up
she is in worse shape than me these days
harvey looks away at joyce and danielle playing
theyre oblivious to the world
next week my treatment begins
do me a favor
bring the kid with you
freds pencil completes a sketch of joyce pushing harvey in a wheelchair
the word cancer appears everywhere floating all around the image
the following montage chronicles harveys illness by cutting between comic art depicting key events and shots of harvey joyce and fred creating the book
the montage is set to the simultaneously dulcet and discordant tone of miles davis blue in green or something similar
close on harveys face as hes getting pushed down the hall in a wheelchair
a panel of harvey entering the m
we see harvey joyce and fred sitting around a table
joyce fights to keep harvey focused on the project
an enraged harvey throws things around the house
joyce on the bed crying a cat licking her back
a balding harvey depressed in the shower
he holds a clump of hair in his hand
harvey in the shower
the balloon above his head reveals his inner turmoil over losing his hair and his face swelling
harvey in agony
various positions of him in bed on all fours covered with a case of shingles
i feel like im on fire appears over his head
joyce and fred go over some more comic art
joyce carries the idea over to harvey wearing a baseball cap who cant get out of the couch
he looks it over and nods
danielle brings harvey a glass of water
harvey crawling up the steps
im so weak i cant make it he thinks
harvey and joyce in a hospital waiting room
hes slumped over she has her hand on him
a delirious harvey surrounded by nurses and joyce
shes torturing me she wont let me die i wanna die
a balding harvey lies on his bathroom floor
his cat walks all over him
i wanna die
just let me die
joyce attempts to wake harvey up
she curses at him
she slaps him
why are you doing this to me
a drawing of joyce doubled over crying
i cant take this anymore
a repeat of the opening scene
like a ghost a naked harvey stands over his bed staring down at a sleeping joyce
in the eerie light hes almost translucent
joyce springs up alarmed
whats wrong harvey
what are you doing up
harvey just stands there for a moment saying nothing
what is it
delirious out of breath tell me the truth
am i some guy who writes about himself in a comic book
or am i just just a character in that book
when i die will dat character keep goin
or will he just fade away
joyce just stares at him unsure how to answer
finally harvey collapses
joyce leaps from the bed nervous hysterical
she gets down on the floor and shakes him
harvey wake up
his eyes remain closed his expression far far away
the sound of joyces voice fades until it seems like a distant echo
then panels from harveys comics begin to float over his head his life literally passing before his eyes in comic book form
slowly the comic images and the unconscious harvey evaporate giving way to we are now in a large empty room similar to a blank comic book panel
a healthy fully dressed harvey appears in the corner of the frame
he is very far away barely recognizable
we slowly dolly towards him as he delivers a formal soliloquy to the camera my name is harvey pekar
its an unusual name harvey pekar
as harvey speaks one dimensional comic book images from his life pass over the screen once again
this time in front of him behind him everywhere
we dolly in towards him
was the year i got my first apartment and my first telephone book
imagine my surprise when i looked up my name and saw that in addition to me another harvey pekar was listed
images of harveys childhood float by followed by his young adult years
i was listed as harvey l
my middle name is lawrence
he was listed as harvey pekar no middle initial
therefore his was a purer listing
we see harvey age in the images hes hanging on the street corner with friends collecting records hanging with crumb
then in the seventies i noticed that a third harvey pekar was listed in the phone book
this filled me with curiosity
how could there be three people with such an unusual name in the world let alone in one city
now numerous images of harveys many years at the v
hospital float by harvey filing harvey arguing with his boss harvey and toby etc
then one day a person i worked with expressed her sympathy to me concerning what she thought was the death of my father
she pointed out an obituary notice in the newspaper for a man named harvey pekar
one of his sons was named harvey
these were the other harvey pekars
the comic images fade out
harvey is once again alone in the empty room
six months later harvey pekar jr
although id met neither man i was filled with sadness
what were they like i thought
it seemed that our lives had been linked in some indefinable way
we slowly move in on his face
as close as the camera can get
but the story does not end there
for two years later another harvey pekar appeared in the directory
what kind of people are these
where do they come from what do they do
whats in a name
we are close on harveys face as he lays passed out and delirious on the floor
over this we hear
who is harvey pekar
his face slowly fades to black
scrawled across the top in yellow and red it read our cancer year
the drawing depicts harvey doubled over on the front lawn groceries in the snow with joyce attempting to help him up
a hand flips the book open and signs the inside leaf
joyce and a healthy looking harvey sit at a table signing copies of their opus
about fifteen or so people mill about with copies
heres our man a year later
somehow i made it through the treatments an the doctors are optimistic
i guess joyce was right about doin the big comic book
we published the thing as a graphic novel our first collaboration and ended up with rave reviews
we even won the american book award
the place is still a mess but somehow it has a better vibe than it had before
this might be due to the presence of danielle
she sits crossed legged on the floor making jewelry out of beads
joyce guides her
harvey shuffles into the room
he watches for a moment as joyce and danielle play
angle on joyce there is an awkward expression almost resembling a smile on her face
he interrupts them
joyce looks up
harvey looks like hes trying to hide something
what is it harvey
that was the doctor
joyce stops what shes doing and gulps
she hangs on harveys every word
he said im all clear
tears well in harveys eyes
joyce breathes a sigh of relief and danielle jumps up and runs over to harvey
she hugs him
harvey sits in the bleachers watching joyce teach danielle to ice skate
harveys got a box of pizza next to him
he picks up a slice and chomps on it
the cheese drips out of his mouth onto his shirt
the weirdest thing that came outta my illness was danielle
with her real mother runnin around who knows where an seein how well her and joyce got on fred decided shed have a better life with us
i was scared at first but then i thought what the hell
shes a good kid
so we ended up takin her an raising her as our own
harvey and danielle lie on the futon together
harveys comics are strewn around the room everywhere
danielle flips through one
ya keep readin em backward
i like reading them backward
holding up a comic is that you
i keep tellin ya all of ems me man
you look like a monster
yeah well waitll ya see what youre gonna look like
yer part of the story too now
the story of my life
danielle makes a face
yeah i know im not as interesting as the little mermaid and all that magical crap
maybe i want to write my own comic
i dont know yet
but not about you
you have enough already
harvey walks towards the bus stop to send danielle to school
he holds her hand
ya know you should write about things in your own life
like school and
i dont know girl stuff
to harvey do you have to hold my hand
wounded what are you embarrassed a me
i know im embarrassing
i felt the same way about my father
danielle looks up at harvey like hes crazy
youre just squeezing it too hard
shaking her head joyce is right
you are obsessive compulsive
danielle drops his hand and rushes onto the bus with other kids
harvey waves and watches as it pulls away
he turns and walks by himself down the busy cleveland street a familiar image from the opening
hes still hunched over
hes still harvey
yeah so i guess comics brought me a lot
but dont think this is some sunny happy ending
every day is still a major struggle
joyce an i fight like crazy an she barely works
the kids got a
and is a real handful
my expenses have gone up so much that im writin freelance round the clock just to make my bills
my life is total chaos
now the real harvey walks down the same busy cleveland street towards his job
with a little luck ill get a window of good health between retirin an dyin
the golden years right
between my pension and the chunk of change i got for this movie i should be able to swing somethin
sure ill lose the war eventually but the goal is to win a few skirmishes along the way
the real harvey slumps at the desk now flipping through a comic book
the real toby comes into the file room carrying a cake with sparklers
hes followed by a group of harveys real coworkers and joyce and real danielle
harvey moves the comic off his desk so toby can put the cake down
the festive cake reads happy retirement harvey
real joyce cuts the cake and passes slices to the group
another worker pops a bottle of champagne
close on a glass of champagne getting filled
the glass sits next to the comic harvey was reading
harveys new edition of american splendor is subtitled our movie year
it features an illustration of harvey joyce and danielle surrounded by cameras lights and crew
