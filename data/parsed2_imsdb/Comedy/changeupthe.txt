written by jon lucas scott moore july then we hear a baby scream bloody murder
then a second baby joins in even more shrill than the first
finally we hear the worst two words a parent can ever hear your turn
dave lockwood bleary eyed father of three shuffles through his well appointed suburban home passing a grandfather clock reading
he stumbles over a toy giraffe it squeaks and dave sleepily mumbles sorry hank
his eyes half open dave changes the diaper of his very cute very insane nine month old daughter sarah who screams and pitches about her changing table
honey thats not maybe if you she snatches a tin of baby powder and swings it about like a mace knocking over the diaper caddy the wipes the lotion and
dispersing a cloud of white powder all over the nursery
blinded and sneezing dave manages to stay on point and change the diaper like van damme at the end of bloodsport
he finishes changing sarah places her back in her crib then picks up sarahs twin brother peter from his crib which is good because hes been slamming his head against
come on buddy weve talked about the head thing dave places peter on the changing table and opens his diaper
its only wet and dave pleasantly relieved reaches for a fresh diaper
only sarah has knocked the caddy all the way down the changing table
holding down peter with his left hand dave fully extends leaning waaay over reaching for the diaper caddy
its just out of reach
he somehow stretches further
its only when dave glances back that he realizes that his head is now perfectly lined up with his sons quivering anus
with mustardy projectile stool blasting dave in the eyes nose and open mouth
dave remains frozen excrement dripping down his face but like a true dad he does not let go of his squirming child
dave staggers down the hall his hair white with baby powder his face covered in poo and a twin in each arm screaming into each of his ears
he soldiers on stoic an unsung hero in his time
juggling the twins in his arms dave wipes his face off with paper towels and prepares two baby bottles nipples filters defrosted breastmilk while the babies take turns kicking him
in the balls and screaming
please sweetheart not my honey daddy needs those dave sits on his couch and positions the screaming squirming twins across his lap in an x pattern plunks the bottles into
their mouths and instantly the twins settle down and slurp away like perfect little angels
then he reaches for the remote control and turns on the tv
an old rerun of magnum p
dave watches exhausted and expressionless
on screen tom selleck resplendent in mustache corduroy short shorts and hawaiian shirt teaches a nubile co ed in a scandalous bikini how to snorkel in beautiful sun drenched waikiki
theyre laughing and having a blast
dave watches detached
then his face starts to change
is this the life you always dreamed of
dave shakes his head no despair in his eyes
on tv the co ed nods yes and hungrily kisses magnum
dave watches on with genuine existential longing
and soon a tear falls from his eye
and then another
take me with you magnum p
before long dave is crying like a schoolgirl
please take me with you
how are the kids
we are now dave in a conservative suit and clutching a massive coffee hurries down the hall with flemming steel iii s stiff humorless waspy partner of this white shoe
children are such a joy
to passing secretary good morning rebecca
any word on the amalgamated merger
all but signed
and just in time for your partner review no less
i hadnt noticed
i look forward to having your antic sense of humor in the partners suite lockwood
it can get a touch dry up there
thank you sir
re daves necktie knot but a double windsor
come on son this isnt the dog track
no sir absolutely not
dave quickly undoes his tie as flemming turns down a hallway
sabrina mcardle cute young paralegal falls into step with dave stymieing laughter
the dog track
last week he told me my shoes were dangerously italian
laughing handing him docs amalgamated signing statements
have a good one
she smiles and breezes back down the hallway
dave stops and watches her go lust in his eyes
then he hears tsk tsk tsk
he looks over at his mean old secretary gladys sitting at her desk
for shame mr
you are a married man
i have no idea what youre talking about gladys
reddening he snatches a huge pile of pink message slips and hurries towards his office
she follows him scolding with children
yes thank you i almost forgot about them for like two seconds
dave enters his modest office his phone is ringing
the only thing that harlot needs to put in her mouth is a sandwich
gladys im a grown man okay
he angrily punches speaker on his ringing phone as he reties his tie with a more traditional knot
a shrill horribly impersonated british accent fills daves office as well as all of the surrounding offices
as gladys and various co workers turn shocked dave quickly fumbles for the receiver and takes the call off speaker
jesus mitch im at work
dude how stoned are you
mitch planko shirtless dodgers hat backwards sitting on a futon in his sparse white apartment smoking a bong shaped like a shotgun
he drops the horrible accent im pretty stoned
come on its in the morning
dude guess what
i found a futon on the street
that is great news
i sort of had to fight a bum for it is that bad
is there a reason youre calling or
are you gonna bitch out on tonight
you are arent you
dave half listening sits at his desk and answers emails
dodgers giants dude
we havent missed one of these in like years
dont be a vajeen
dude im coming
you always do this
you never make time for your friends anymore and im sorry to be the one to tell you this but people are starting to talk
feelings are getting hurt
not mine because like a samurai i have trained myself to feel nothing except revenge and honor but other people nameless other more sensitive people are hurt and they think
you need to treasure your friendships a little bit more
exhaling massive bong rip how concerned should i be that my new futon smells like death
distracted typing look just what time are you picking me up tonight
if you bail i will rape you
dude i get it im coming in your eye
i will eye rape you
just then theres a knock on mitchs apartment door
mitch starts waving away the pot smoke
gotta go pick you up at six
stay with mitch as he quickly clicks off his iphone jams his bong under the futon opens the window and tries to blow the pot smoke out of his apartment
with quick little puffs
one sec dad
the smoke clears and mitch jogs to the door and opens it to reveal his father mitch sr
s friendly in a suit holding a pile of mail
your mailbox was spilling over
oh thanks i always forget
they hug and mitch takes the mail and without looking at it chucks it onto a huge pile of old mail in the corner
were you smoking marijuana in here
honestly its my new futon it smells like illegal drugs
weve talked about this mitch
smoke your grass on the balcony okay
its just hard for me to tell the other tenants they cant smoke in their units when my own son is blazing away in his you know
you got it dad
oh hey i saw your commercial on channel again last night
give gonorrhea the boot or samirs pet shack our low low prices are snake sational
samirs pet shack
its just a shame you cant see your face in that giant ape costume
actually the real shame is that samir paid me in fucking organic bird seed but whatever
he glares at several crates of bird seed by the door
well your mother wouldve liked it
she always loved animals
i was just in the neighborhood wanted to check in
how you doing cash wise
im a little tight actually pops
especially vis a vis you know the whole bird seed situation
can you make it a grand
mitchs dad smiles to hide his disappointment and hands his year old son a roll of hundred dollar bills
you thought any more about coming to work for me
im not really sure im a work guy you know what i mean
plus ive been getting a ton of auditions recently so
okay well my door is always open
smiles and awkwardly bumps his sons fist
batting cages next weekend
see you then
smiles sadly and exits
mitch burps and reaches for his bong having noticed none of his fathers distress
establishing shots of daves beautiful colonial home
huge oak trees shade the lush front lawn
new audi and bmw station wagons sit in the driveway
we hear water splashing
the twins sit in the bath motionless anticipatory
dave rises up from beside the tub arms upraised soap suds covering his face
the twins scream and splash ecstatic
dave tries not to laugh but hes having too much fun
behind dave his sweet daughter cara sits on the closed toilet lid in a ballet tutu reading her butterfly book
daddy daddy which is your favorite butterfly the southern monarch or the many spotted skipperling
dave glances at the book as he washes the twins
oh im a many spotted skipperling man all the way
the southern monarch is just a glorified moth
i tend to agree
then his handsome wife jamie s blows into the bathroom in a suit and starts removing her makeup
what a day
klein lost the twins immunization record the wireless went down and cara got bullied in ballet class again
nicolette peters keeps knocking me over during the battement glisse
oh im sorry sugar bug
dave looks genuinely concerned
cara just shrugs and keeps reading her butterfly book
jamie whispers to him we need to remind her to keep striving for verbal resolution
right of course
jamie finally notices daves foam covered face and softens
and how was your day monster man
before dave can answer the doorbell rings ding dong
they exchange the weary smile of parents who never see each other
of course hes early
all he does all day is eat hummus and masturbate
to reveal mitch in shades fedora and a dodgers jersey
jamie holding cara lets him in
he takes cara and playfully and incredibly recklessly flips her in the air
hows my favorite ballerina
are you coming to my recital on thursday
oh no honey the only style of dancing i support is exotic
he plunks her on the floor and blows into replete with granite counter tops built in appliances fresh flowers and bowls teeming with fruit
mitch beelines for the subzero fridge and opens it its stocked
his eyes alight
jesus christ you could feed africa with this fridge
as jamie starts prepping a salad across the kitchen mitch raids the fridge packing his cargo pants with kids snacks bagels yogurts juice boxes everything
these leftovers from mortons
oh no hon those are super old too late mitch is already eating the very old steak
as mitch chews he eyes jamie chopping vegetables
you look hot by the way jame
jamie laughs but clearly doesnt mind the flirtation
i never wouldve guessed twins
annnd thats probably enough
is dave still meeting your needs sexually
jamie just laughs shaking her head unbelievable
oh did i tell you i ran into miss hickam last week at starbucks
our old kindergarten teacher
she always liked dave better than me
honey everyone likes dave better than you
anyway i tried to get her number but she goes i dont date former students so i go great do you fuck former students
and then she calls me a potty mouth degenerate and runs out without her coffee
so i got a free venti macchiato which is cool bathed changed and in their pis
mitch turns to see dave in khakis and a buttondown entering the kitchen with the freshly bathed twins
mitch grins awww
come to uncle mitch
dave hands the twins to mitch and they coo impishly cute
oh my god they smell like heaven had sex with a dryer sheet
loudly to babies they just gurgle why cant they talk yet
are they retarded or something
the one on the left looks a little downsy
aside to dave a little bit though right
ignoring him dave fastens the twins into their bouncy seats
ill be back right after the game okay pumpkin
see you jame
always a pleasure mitch
mitch steals three pears and some tulips as he exits
on the bottle cap opener mounted on mitchs dashboard
mitch offers dave one of his own beers as they speed along in his fiero
dave is reluctant
yeah im good
youre going to make me drink alone
yeah well youre driving so
mitch shrugs and slides the spare beer into his chest pocket
oh dude great news
you found another futon
thats awesome because im made of emotional teflon and words cant hurt me anymore
no i auditioned for a major movie role yesterday
its called busted dreams
its about a renegade coroner who reads minds named jake action
its like a sexy mentalist
yeah i read for the part of steve action jakes troubled younger brother with a secret and i fucking killed it
i cried like five times during the audition and its a fucking action movie
plus im the spitting image of the dude who plays jake action so
i hope you get it man
yeah it could be my raging bull
plus id get to kill a lot of women which is cool
offering him a joint hotbox
no man i got a big day tomorrow i cant get wasted tonight
mitch and dave shit faced shake off their shots b r r r
the guys sit in this crowded sports bar watching the dodgers game on a huge tv
when clayton kershaw strikes out fred lewis to win the game the guys drunkenly slap five change up fuck hes good
hes no fernando
of course not
fernando is like the highlander
there can be only one
toasting his beer they sloppily drink when dave suddenly remembers oh
so finish your story
the girl calls you up
so she calls me up its like in the morning whats her name
whats her last name
mitch just looks at him
tatiana calls me at in the morning and wants to fuck stein what the fuck who cares
is she hot
she is right
oh my god i already have a boner
maybe we should do this later
i need these stories man
theyre all i have
mitch registers the desperation in his married friends eyes
okay well youre in luck because tatiana is stupid fucking hot
beautiful face legs a mile long perfect ass blonde hair and huuuge boobs
oh my god how big
oh my god she sounds like sabrina
this hot paralegal in my office
is she on your cancer list
whats a cancer list
dont all married dudes have a cancer list
like the first three chicks you would bang if your wife suddenly died of cancer
thats sick man
jamie is the mother of my children
but yes if i had a cancer list sabrina would be the first on it
whos number two
just finish your story man
im dying over here
so tatianas packing double es which means like plus pounds of breastmeat yeah its almost too much for one man to handle
thank god im the son of a butcher and have strong hands and wrists
anyway she walks in wearing this tight black dress and you know what she says to me
dave shakes his head on the edge of his bar stool
because all tatiana wants to do at in the morning is fucky fucky rubber ducky
dave drunkenly slaps him ten barely making hand contact
and look im not one to kiss and tell
downing another shot but this chick is insatiable
she wants it in every position missionary wheelbarrow reverse wheelbarrow assassin i dont even know what those are
no one does
it gets so intense that my nose starts bleeding
yeah so im bleeding all over this chick and shes fucking digging it
its like some weird dracula anne rice shit and im fading in and out of consciousness and then when its all over she turns to me and goes tuesday night
im coming back and were really going to fuck
dave just stares at him glassy eyed drunk emotional
that is maybe the single greatest story ive ever heard in my life
ah its not always like that
i dont know why
i dont know why ive always been in such a rush you know
do you mean
you remember me in high school i was always so focussed on getting into a good college then when i got to college i was so focussed on getting into
a good law school then in law school i was just trying to land a job at a good firm then jamie and i got married and we had cara right away i just feel like and i missed out on all the fun stuff you know
the sex the drugs the bad choices and now its too late
i blew it
i pissed away my s and now im staring down the barrel a seriously boring life
oh come on jamie is hot
no i know i really want to have sex with her
and your kids are adorable
theyre like fun little puppies that talk
the bill comes
dave pulls out a wad of cash throws it on the table and stumbles for the door
mitch lifts one of daves twenties off the table and follows him out
they stumble down the dark hollywood street together
dont get me wrong i love my kids i do i would take a bullet for them but
remember that heroin addict you dated
jesus how many heroin addicts have you dated
its a national scourge dude
having kids is like dating a heroin addict only instead of dating them they move into your house for years
theyre laughing one second and crying the next and then theyre trying to kill themselves in your bathroom for no reason
theyre mean and selfish and they burn through all your money and they steal your shit and they break everything and they stay up all night and they listen to
really shitty music and the dirty secret is no one actually likes kids
oh come on you dont mean that
everyone pretends to like kids because if you dont you look like a huge dick
its like drew barrymore or jazz
no one actually likes them but if you say that out loud everybody hates you
dude i love drew barrymore have you seen boys on the side
they weave across a large plaza stumbling for mitchs car
im just saying dont fuck up your life like i did okay
what are you talking about
youve got it all
youve got a huge house full of food and furniture shit your tv is bigger than my car
you have a great job you make a shit ton of money and people respect you man
my last job involved an ape costume do you know what that does to a man
dave waves him off not really hearing him
but mitch is sincere heartfelt plus youve got a hot extremely fuckable wife who cooks and cleans and takes care of all your needs
its like having a really hot mom who you can also have sex with
also youre never lonely you always have someone to talk to about your day plus you get to do all the fun gay couple stuff like go to wine country
you think single guys can go to wine country
they wont even let us in
youre living the dream dude
what more do you want
i want tatiana
i want sex with strange new women and maybe also with sabrina if shes single and i want to wake up at noon and smoke weed all afternoon and i
want to not think about the needs of four other people hours a day and i want to start reading a novel and actually finish it and i want to take a solid shit because im not constantly stressed out and i want to learn how to rollerblade and also i really want to pee
yeah me too
they look around the plaza and their eyes land on the huge fountain in the middle a greek goddess sits atop it
they stumble over to the fountain unzip their pants and leaning on each other begin peeing into it
mitch glances up at the greek goddess metis
she scowls down at them
this chick does not look happy
maybe she has three kids and a job she hates
dude enough already
im just saying
i envy your life
and thats whats so fucked because i envy yours
yeah you dont i do
no i do
i wish i had your life
i wish i had your life
theyre about to say jinx when a thunder clap crashes and the electrical grid starts shutting down neighborhood by neighborhood
soon the entire city is pitch black
dave and mitch freeze terrified hugging
then all the lights in the city flicker back to life
r rolling blackout
they continue peeing a little freaked out
you really have nice flow by the way
very thick and confident
yours is very steamy
my urologist says i run a little warm
eventually they both finish tuck in and zip up
you good to drive
now i am
as they stumble off towards mitchs fiero hold on the statue of metis the shape shifting greek goddess of wisdom
it almost looks like shes smiling
its a beautiful sunny los angeles morning
the silhouette of a body lies in daves bed snoring away
then we hear followed by what is unequivocally mitchs patter and his whose fucking baby is that
a hand emerges and fumbles on the night stand
and where the fuck is my bong
he groggily rises from the sheets only its not mitch
his body his face everything
yup you got it the single auy and the married guy have switched bodies
we will refer to them by their brain names thus while this hungover dude definitely looks like dave inside hes mitch so thats what well call him
the actors of course will remain in their bodies
mitch doesnt know any of this yet
why are there so many fucking pillows
he rolls over to see jamie sitting up in bed pulling her breasts out of her tank top getting ready to nurse the twins
mitch launches out of bed suddenly very awake
she starts breast feeding the babies confused
whats your problem
mitch shields his eyes with his hands shocked and disgusted
oh my god that is so gross
put your tits away
this isnt europe
what are you talking about
mitch finally notices hes in daves bedroom
wait why am i in
did i sleep here last night
panicked he thrusts his fist like have sex
are you insane
so why the hell did i wake up in your bed
are you still drunk
look just wheres dave
wheres fucking dave
dave is right here
he turns and sees himself in the mirror
he is dave
oh my god
oh my god
he slowly touches his new face
im a fucking tool
a body lies sprawled on mitchs futon out cold
insane pounding on the door shatters the silence
the body sits up groggy and confused it is of course dave in mitchs body
while he looks like mitch he moves talks and even shuffles to the door exactly like dave
fucking open the fucking door
dave stops noticing that hes in mitchs empty apartment
why am i in your sad apartment the door dude
open the door
fine jesus relax dave opens the door to see himself standing there
what the fuck is this
dave backpedals terrified as mitch blows inside furious
i knew it
who the hell are you
and why do you look like me
mitch angles dave over to the mirror on the otherwise barren wall and dave sees hes in mitchs body
stunned he slowly touches his new face
his new hair
his new body
oh my god
i know dude
im a fucking loser
dave spins completely awake now how the fuck did this happen
how should i know
has this ever happened to you before
what switching bodies with another human being
oh yeah this shit happens to me like twice a week
i dont want to be you
oh you dont want to be me
no no no i dont want to be you
whats that supposed to mean
look lets just
how could this have possibly happened
they pace about the apartment trying to think
dave grabs mitchs nipple and twists it hard
ow ow ow fuck
first of all youre a penis
second of all wait whatd you just say
i called you a penis and running out the door come on
dave speeds through morning traffic in his audi station wagon leaning on the horn
mitch sits shotgun confused
remember last night when we peed into that fountain
as we peed we wished we had each others lives
our wishes mustve
i thought wishes came true when you threw a coin into a fountain
well apparently urine works too
i wouldve wished for something way cooler
unable to find a parking spot mitch and dave double park on hollywood boulevard hop out and sprint for the plaza
what are we gonna do when we get to the fountain
were gonna hug each other and pee into the fountain and wish our lives back
that might sound really gay
both men race around the corner onto the plaza and stop cold a department of parks crew is cleaning up the site where it once sat
mitch and dave are blown away
they hurry up to the crew foreman
where is the fountain
its getting restored
where did you take it
i dont know chief im not the fountain spokesman im just the guy that fills the fucking hole
who could tell us where it is
maybe the district manager
district manager carla nelson sits behind her desk in her bland office her face the model of bureaucratic ennui
its not in the computer
opposite her dave and mitch pull their hair out insane
well of course its not
when will it be in the computer
you could try calling tomorrow
we cant wait until tomorrow carla
how can you lose a fountain
beat deadpan its not in the computer
mitch lunges for carla but dave grabs him and wrestles him out of the office
well call you tomorrow
dave and mitch exit the department of parks building and pace on the sunny sidewalk their hands on their heads stunned
this is so fucked
we should just go home and lock the mitchs phone rings in daves pocket
dave hesitates then answers it fruitlessly trying to sound like mitch this is fucking mitch
i dont talk like that dude okay
dave clicks off
who was that
marty green the producer of busted dreams
apparently the guy they cast for steve action odd last night and the back up actor got deported so alphabetically youre the next actor on the list
you got the part man
mitch covers his mouth like he just won american idol
oh my god
oh my god
dreams really do come true
wait no this sucks
im stuck in your fat dad body
i cant play steve action looking like this
remembering stunned oh my god and ive got my closing today
what is that like a big deal
whether or not i make partner is riding on this
so what the hell are we gonna do
then mitch looks at dave
we cant just be each other for a day mitch
you have no idea how to be a lawyer
dude im an actor a human chameleon i can do lawyer in my fucking sleep
its you im worried about you cant act for shit
first of all its busted dreams okay
its not the reader
second of all im a wasp ive spent my entire life acting happy and no one has ever questioned my performance okay
they look at each other cooling off a bit
are we actually considering doing this
i mean we have to
both men look highly anxious
dave glances at the time
all right well my meeting starts in minutes
you need to race home get dressed then go to my office and find my secretary gladys she sounds hot is she hot
get the merger docs from gladys and take them to the conference room
all the partners will be there so do not speak to anyone
because i can vamp no
and once the meeting starts you will continue to say nothing
when a partner asks you for the merger documents you will silently hand them over okay
dude i get it
play it big but maintain my reality
play it small
ive spent the last nine months banging out the terms of this deal all you have to do is hand over the documents
dude thats easy as fuck
okay for me go home put on some cool clothes and get to set all the info is on my phone
once youre there go to hair makeup and memorize your lines and try not to be a total douche to everyone okay
this is the film industry
everyone is really cool
they look at each other very doubtful that this will work
im trusting you dude
im trusting you too
they hug tight then release
oh hey you also need to pick up cara from ballet at okay
heads for the car im so fucking all over that shit
off of daves deeply unsettled look we mitch blows into daves stodgy law firm looking like a lawyer from a ralph lauren ad he sports a pink buttondown red suspenders
a blue crested blazer khakis no socks black and white wingtips and slicked back hair
he also affects a preposterous patrician accent like john kerry or any white guy on a black sitcom
his co workers look at him like hes fucking nuts
falling into step with him is gladys his mean old secretary
what in gods name are you wearing
holy dick are you gladys
youre a lynx
w what is a lynx
a white haired cougar
you really should dress sexier though
the whole angry prison nurse thing is a huge mistake
gladys gasps and jams some documents into his hands
here are your merger documents
good day to you
she storms off
mitch calls after her hey wheres my meeting at
she angrily points at a conference room as she stalks off
the conference room is full of executives from kinkabe technologies and amalgamated industries as well as several well heeled lawyers
they chat amiably until in his ridiculous outfit
the room goes silent but mitchs confidence remains sky high what up white people
republican party in the house am i right
come on lets get started
everyone looks a bit confused by this nobody telling them what to do but nonetheless they begin taking their seats
mitch goes around introducing himself
dave lockwood thanks for coming
dave lockwood i did all the work
dave lockwood san konichi wa
to the room anyone need anything
mimosa spicy tuna roll
all right guys take it away
mitch takes one of the last open seats at the head of the conference table
its clearly in his bosss seat
flemming steel iii hovers awkwardly
yes well thank you dave
clearing his throat we are gathered here today to codify the marriage of two bold industry leaders kinkabe technologies and amalgamated industries
mitch starts applauding
finally even flemming claps as well uncomfortable
b before we sign on the proverbial bottom line are there any outstanding questions or concerns that we might address
ask now or forever hold your peace
pleasant chuckles in the room
then the japanese american ceo of kinkabe technologies ken kinkabe s raises his hand
we just wanted to make sure that ratios havent changed given the recent market fluctuations
everyone turns to mitch
whos not listening
hes drawing pictures of boobs on a yellow legal pad
mitch looks up sees everyone looking at him
right my bad thinking thats his cue he slides flemming the documents
kinkabe had a question about the dpa ratios
deer in headlights
how are they
theyre fucking terrible
look everythings cool lets just sign this fucking thing and go party
were all rich who cares
kinkabe angrily jabs his finger at the incredibly short ceo of amalgamated industries ted norton s
i knew it
you were never serious about this merger
spare me ken you were just trying to inflate your share price
this merger is over
i will see you in court
not if we see you first you prick
the execs furiously race out of the conference room all of them reaching for their cell phones
war has been declared
the lawyers hurry after the clients fruitlessly trying to coax them back to the table
mitch frowns oo and tiptoes for the exit
until flemming steel iii grabs his arm furious
right now you need to give me one reason not to fire you
mitch stammers oh shit
this this is all part of my master plan
check it out if we drag this out
we make more money right
of course we do
and then we can bill the fuck out of them
some of them dont even speak ah the engrish so goo you know what im saying
thats your plan
its not a very good plan is it
son what youve just said to me is highly illegal
you could go to jail for a very long time just for suggesting it
were above the law
i must say ive never seen this side of you before lockwood
i always thought you were on the straight and narrow
fuck that ese
im straight up gangster all the way through
flemming eyes him determining his fate
mitch cant breathe
fine ill roll the dice with you but if word of this gets out i will throw you under the bus so darn fast you wont know what hit you
now go put on some proper clothes
you look like joe pesci
flemming steel iii hurries off
mitch exhales holy shit
dave nervously pulls up to a ranch house in the fiero reading the address off his iphone
several crew trucks are parked out front and pas with headsets loiter about
dave gets out wearing an ironed buttondown shirt tucked into khakis
he self consciously untucks half his shirt trying to look cooler as he approaches a nearby p
yo mitch planko is here
where the fuck is hair makeup
thats so real
dave stiffly walks off as the p
eyes him weirded out
dave now in leather pants the top four buttons of his shirt undone sits in the makeup chair getting his hair styled
he studies the script confused
then a p

dave alarmed follows the p
out and theyve taken over this valley ranch house cables lights and sound equipment run everywhere

its a lorno
i im not familiar with that genre
you ever hear of skinemax
they arrive in bedecked with cameras grip equipment and thousands of lit candles
unbuttons daves shirt even further and starts smearing his chest and face with crisco oil
just then the fat balding director valtan just valtan from some ethnically cleansed balkan state s blows in
make him shiny like fish
excuse me are you in charge here
i think theres been some sort of mona
and then mona aging actress with fake boobs teeters in wearing a flimsy nightgown and six inch heels

runs in with a huge machine gun with rocket launcher attachment and gives it to dave who takes it limply
guard try to stop you line line line knock him the fuck out you see mona asleep in bed you wake her up and start fuck time okay

and no you cant pay me to give you a real bj i dont do that shit anymore
daves mouth opens but nothing comes out
guides him out of the room
hes still in a trance
dave stands there frozen
behind the camera valtan gestures go
dave stumbles into the bedroom holding the huge machine gun like well like a corporate lawyer
a blow dried goon appears with a gun
dave looks around at the bright lights the camera the crew watching him and he freezes up
the goon tries again i said no entry
then dave sees a p
waving at him holding up a huge board with his lines written on them
shielding his eyes from the lights dave reads his lines monotone if you let me dont in
dont let me in
if you dont let me in paco i will fuck you dead
that doesnt sound right
if you dont let me taco is his name paco or taco
your penmanship is illegible fuck it we fix in post
just knock out guard wake up girl and make fuck time
dave very effeminately karate chops the goon in the neck once and the guy dramatically throws himself against the wall and drops unconscious
then dave crosses and pretends to suddenly see mona in the bed
his acting is atrocious
oh my goodness it is lola my long lost lover lola who
annnd mona wake up surprised
mona not much of a better actor than dave wakes up and screams deafeningly like some s horror queen
you perfect bastard
and now kiss her like savage
dave totally grossed out by her very reluctantly leans in for the kiss
just before their lips meet he pulls away
what the fuck man
she ready for first class trip to fuck town
look i cant im married
no no no steve action throw wife off cliff in last scene
no i mean me in real life
so am i
mona my wife
yeah how stupid is that shit man
now go fake fuck my wife before owners of house come back from ski vacation to find film crew in master bedroom
dave just stands there hopelessly out of place
standing in the back of an auditorium as on stage two dozen year old girls in tutus prance about rehearsing a ballet
the teacher mrs
kleinman fruitlessly tries to direct them
camera finds cara onstage twirling around until a bigger girl nicolette peters knocks her over
kleinman turns to see cara splayed out on the ground trying not to cry
oh cara do try to stay on your toes
lets start again
in the audience mitch straightens what was that
mitch drives cara home from ballet
she sits shotgun in her tutu looking small and sad
shouldnt i be sitting in my carseat
whatever youre fine hey whats up with that little blonde bitch who knocked you over
she looks a little surprised by her dads language
thats nicolette peters
she does that a lot actually
so why dont you fight back
um because you told me not to
you said i should strive for verbal resolution
fuck verbal resolution
put that whore on her back and shank her
do you know how to make a shiv
mitch lights a cigarette with the car lighter
listen to me kid the world is a cesspool of cruelty and violence
if someone comes at you with a knife you gotta put their entire fucking family in the morgue okay
thats called jailyard justice
because if you dont come back hard on a bitch your ass is gonna get sold for a pack of camel lights and a jello cup yunderstand
always solve your problems with violence
cara nods alarmed
o okay daddy
hes sitting at a booth in a bar highly traumatized
i dry humped a strangers leg for three hours today
sitting opposite him mitch downs a shot exhausted
cry me a river dude i dealt with ballet and your ass hat boss today
oh no what happened at work
off daves look i fixed it
off daves look okay but look it was not my fault
the japs started peppering me with questions and i had to improvise and then everyone got very emotional and well
it looks like were going to court
oh my god tell me youre kidding
yeah your boss was pretty miffed but then i told him this was all part of my master plan to make more money off our clients what
yeah turns out thats totally illegal but the old man was surprisingly cool about it
dave sits there speechless
mitch eats wings
hey your secretary is sort of hot in like a dame judi dench playing a nazi kind of way
is she on the fuck team
i just want to go home
as the sun sets
the windows are open and the wind is in their hair
theyre very much not talking to each other
dave and mitch head up daves front walk solemn
what are you gonna tell jamie
can i highly recommend against that
mitch and dave enter to find cara running down the stairs in her dora the explorer pajamas
dave smiles and opens his arms tired and overjoyed to see her
hey sugar bug
but she passes right by him and hugs mitch
dave stammers stung
mitch hugs her acting stiff like dave
well hello my precocious daughter
okay i dont sound like that just then jamie hurries past the twins in her arms and kisses mitch on the lips
both men startle a bit
this is so weird
you staying for dinner
then mitch nudges dave
right no thank you
im look jamie we really need to talk
okay but make it quick ive got to put the twins to bed
im not mitch
we switched bodies last night
jamie looks back and forth between them expressionless
you see what happened was we peed into a magic fountain then the city moved the fountain but as soon as they find it were going to switch back
sounds like a plan
are you kidding
is she kidding
jamie heads for the stairs when dave stops her
baby please dont okay mitch first of all dont call me baby its creepy
second of all
what the hell are you talking about
look i can prove its true
just i dont know just ask me anything that only i that only dave would know
whens our wedding anniversary
dave freezes oh shit
dude its march th even i know that
why do you know that
so that i can send you a thoughtful card what kind of monster are you
look just ask me anything else
i really dont have time to jamie please
whats my favorite color

dude do you not understand what were trying to accomplish here
im just saying look at all the accents in this room she loves mauve
baby jamie ask me anything else something more personal
fine what did we talk about two nights ago
i was crying
taking a stab in the dark yourrrrr mother maybe
thats great mitch
thanks a big bunch
come on honey
jamie steams upstairs pissed with cara in tow
dave runs his hands through his hair fuck
mitch looks appalled dude you are like the worst husband ever
i have a lot on my plate right now man
you have no idea
okay look calm down i can hold down the fort for one night
are you joking
you worked at my job for one day and you almost got arrested
what are you gonna do to my family
dude the kids are already going to bed
i think i can handle watching two and a half fucking men and falling asleep on the couch with the best of em
the only roadblock i foresee is what do i tell jamie
what do you tell jamie
when she wants to have sex tonight
but its tuesday
i dont understand
you dont have sex on tuesdays
then dave starts laughing
dave hasnt laughed this hard in a long time
he pats mitchs cheek
dave turns and exits the house still laughing
you know what give it a shot
you want me to bang your wife
sure have at it
let me know how it goes
dave parks mitchs fiero on this shady silver lake street glancing at the homeless guy stumbling by a bit scared
dave enters mitchs apartment and flips on the bright overhead light
the white walls are empty
a futon tv and four crates of bird seed are all that occupy the living room
jesus its like a swedish asylum
and then mitchs iphone rings
dave hesitates then answers mitch planko who the fuck is this
a sexy womans voice purrs hiii mitch its tatiana
dave straightens oh shit
how um how are you
ill be better in a few minutes after i fuck you raw
she hangs up
dave freezes wide eyed
oh my god
oh my god
he quickly dials a number
sitting on the plush couch with jamie eating takeout sushi and watching two and a half men on the huge plasma tv
the phone rings
mitch sees the caller id then answers it
hey dude i take back everything i said about two and a half men
this is some edgy shit tatiana is on her way over
what do you think i should do
i think you should fuck her thats what i think you should do
jamie looks over at mitch weirded out he gets up and crosses into the hallway for some privacy
dont blow this for me dude shes my tuesday night regular
but wouldnt i be
cheating on jamie
cheating is when any part of your penis touches any part of another woman who is not your wife and last i checked your wang is safely tucked away in
my incredibly lame triple pleated sport slacks
but my mind is over here doesnt that count
dude how many women have you fucked in your mind
right and thats not cheating right
your reasoning is oddly impeccable
i think youre on firm legal ground here amigo
i say jump that ass
i havent had sex with another woman since college
well it still works the same but this chick is a lot to handle so pace yourself okay
shes hornier than a priest at summer camp
oh my god so am i
theres a knock at the apartment door
dave jumps freaked
holy shit shes already here
what do i do
youll do fine
just wear a condom okay
dont give me aids just then wham the door flies open and a very sexy blonde enters the apartment wearing a long trenchcoat and five inch stiletto heels
she moves towards dave like a panther
freezing breathless tatiana
are you ready to ride
i i honestly dont know
she throws off her trenchcoat to reveal shes not wearing anything underneath
less awesome is the fact that shes nine months pregnant
massive breasts sit atop a huge distended veiny protruding stomach
why the fuck are you still wearing clothes
as she advances towards him dave climbs up the futon
when are you due
any minute now so lets get our fuck on before this becomes a threesome
oh god gross
wait whos the father
am i the father
but you are my daddy
she smiles coyly and slides on top of him
holy shit youre so heavy my tits are aching for you
actually thats probably just the colostrum coming in it can be very tatiana finally stops with the femme fatale routine
okay whats your deal tonight
i just is it my new haircut
i love the coat
is it i dont know the pregnancy
now that you mention it
maybe like a little
what the hell
you picked me up at a single mothers lamaze class
what did you expect
who would do something like that
tatiana angrily crosses the room and with considerable effort bends over and picks up her trenchcoat
look tatiana im sorry
youre incredibly beautiful its just turning fully naked what
im not sexy
oh my god i can see it kicking
you can in fact see the fetus moving around in her belly
you know what
fuck you mitch
dont ever call me again
she yanks on her coat and storms out
wearing pajama pants and no shirt mitch brushes his teeth and fixes his hair trying to look sexy
he sucks in his dad gut in the mirror
jesus dave its called a sit up
then he sees jamies dress land on the bedroom floor followed by her bra
mitch exhales holy shit im finally going to fuck jamie
this is my greatest hour
i hope she likes it weird
then in slow motion jamie enters the bathroom nude her hair gently blowing in the wind from an open window
she looks insanely hot
mitch takes her all in ravenous
oh my god i am going to ruin her and then she sits on the can
and starts taking a dump
mitchs face drops horrified
i have to cool it on the thai food
ive had the shits all day
mitch just stares at her dumbstruck as we hear the loose contents of her bowels empty into the toilet bowl
oh my god
seriously light a candle
she keeps shitting
it sounds like niagara falls
foregoing the candle mitch covers his nose with his forearm and stumbles out of the bathroom nauseous
mitch lies in bed staring wide eyed at the ceiling horrified
jamie slides in bed with him touches his arm what is your problem
look i am not attracted to you right now okay
no means no all right
no means no
tight on jamie rolling over confused and genuinely hurt
then we hear a baby scream bloody murder
then a second baby joins in even more shrill than the first
finally we hear the worst two words a parent can ever hear your turn
its your turn to feed the twins
i really dont feel like it
jamie turns on the light pissed
are you fucking kidding me
no its in the morning you go do it
youre the mother
get the fuck out bed right now and go feed your fucking children or i will fucking cut you
mitch is already scrambling out of the room terrified
yes jamie im sorry jamie
mitch just looks at the twins screaming in their respective cribs no idea what to do
he reaches for the phone
in mitchs apartment jacking off to some very small internet porn on mitchs iphone
then the porn disappears and dave lockwood calling appears on screen
oh come on
answering panting what
i always thought your wife was a nice lady but she is neither nice nor a lady
she talks like a dock worker and she shits like one too
plus i used to think your kids were adorable but actually theyre just really fucking annoying and crazy needy wait are you jacking off
so why are you panting
look i had to i never get this kind of privacy anymore
but isnt that sort of
dave looks down
is that weird
it sort of hooks to the side a bit
go lefty youll get better torque
hey how long have you been shaved down there
its kind of pro forma now dude
yeah only married dudes still rock dick fros anymore wait if tatiana was over earlier why do you still need to jack off
yeeeah tatiana might not be coming back
what did you do
shes nine months pregnant
oh my god youre so picky
i could see the baby kicking dude
so what shes having a girl
it wouldnt have been a little boy tickling your tip
jesus i cant believe you fucked up my tuesday night regular
relax mitch no
you married guys have no idea how hard it is to build a reliable stable
its a full time job
getting girls phone numbers calling them emailing them facebooking them twittering them buying them drinks and dinners and coffees and listening to endless stories about their stupid fucking friends and
begging them to touch your wiener on the second date and building an elaborate web of lies so they dont all find out about each other its exhausting
and then poof
in one night you just casually discard my lifes work
jesus okay im sorry
sorry doesnt lick my ballbag every tuesday night
look is there a reason youre calling me at in the morning
mitch glares back to the twins who are still wailing
yeah your mean wife is making me feed the kids
what do i do
have you changed their diapers already
beat lying yes
okay take them to the kitchen
mitch puts the phone in his mouth and picks up the screaming twins
carrying them like bags of wheat he jogs down as they scream their heads off
hes totally rattled mitch jogs into the kitchen and plop sets the twins on the counter then speaks into the phone again all right
in the kitchen
go to the fridge
mitch turns away from the twins and opens the fridge
he sees a bottle of wine and immediately drinks from the bottle
defrost two bags of breastmilk in the microwave for minutes then prepare two separate bottles
mitch grabs a container of cows milk sniffs it turns to give it to the babies to discover that sarah is gone and peter is licking an electrical socket
mitch yanks peter away just as sparks shoot from the socket
what was that
first attach the filter to the seal to the nipple
mitch hears clink clink and spins to see that sarah has crawled over to the knife block and removed a butcher knife and a meat cleaver and is waving them
about like rattles
oh jesus oh jesus
mitch approaches her wide eyed tentative when sarah giggles and spastically whips the cleaver at him
he barely sidesteps it and it impacts into a cupboard door f twang
this is so fucked up
i know right
and make sure you dont allow any air bubbles in
mitch grabs a pair of tongs and after a few attempts snatches the butcher knife from sarahs hands
then he scoops her up and deposits her into the sink with her brother
finally he slumps over trying to catch his breath
listen to me you need to go downtown first thing tomorrow morning and you need to find that fucking fountain
he starts pouring cows milk into the babies mouths
it splashes all over them but they manage to lap up some of it
honestly im really not sure how much more of this shit i can take
district manager carla nelson sits behind her desk in her bland putty office the next morning
she is still bored
your formal information request was approved
dave stops pacing deeply relieved
so wheres the fountain
we wont hear back for one to three weeks maybe more
how long can it possibly take you to find your own fountain
one to three weeks maybe one to three weeks maybe more
thanks carla you just ruined my life
have an awesome day
dave blows out of there choking on his fury
he looks around for mitch
bad news buddy
dave bounds up the stairs
jamie quietly cries as she gets the twins dressed for the day
dave charges in real bad news
jamie startles and quickly dries her eyes
daves in the shower
are you okay
dave enters concerned and instinctively starts helping her dress the babies
she watches him a bit confused
come on you can tell me
weve been friends forever
hes been acting so strange lately
last night he even told me he wasnt attracted to me
oh my god im going to fucking kill him
just tell me honestly
is dave having an affair
i swear hes not
youre just going through a very temporary rough patch okay
weve been in this rough patch for years this is news to him y you have
you dont want to hear about this
no i really do
tell me everything
jamie looks at him sees the urgency in his eyes
its not his fault really
i love him with all my heart you know i do but you remember daves family growing up
they were a mess
they had nothing
daves entire childhood was spent looking over the fence wanting a better life
so he scrimped and saved and worked four jobs at once and put himself through school and built a better life for himself
ive always loved that about him
no one ever gave him anything
the problem is now that hes got a good life he cant turn it off hes still looking over the fence wanting something even better a second house more kids
a faster car a bigger promotion whatever it is that he thinks will finally make him happy
dave reddens defensive this is hitting very close to home
well poor jamie
you have an ambitious hard working husband who provides for you and your family how can you even stand it
no i know i should be grateful
and i am
i guess all im saying is that dave is so focussed on what he doesnt have that he cant see what he does
and how long can you stay married to someone who is incapable of ever being happy
she looks at him searching
dave stammers realizing for the first time just how much trouble his marriage is in
then check it out i have freckles on my taint
how awesome is that
they turn to see mitch in the doorway buck naked and wet holding a hand mirror under his balls
then he sees dave
oh hey fag
whyre you here
one to three weeks maybe more
mitch shaves in the bathroom as dave paces anxious
what the fuck does that even mean
it means we might be in each others bodies for a while
i cant do this anymore
your life sucks
my life sucks
you drive a fiero jamie calls through the door um im going to work
all right angel
have a nice day
you guys okay in there
just two dudes chilling in the bathroom nothing weird about that
see you later
we hear jamies footsteps retreat
dave grows emotional listen to me i know i complain about my family sometimes but jamie and the kids are everything to me
my marriage is falling apart my job is on the line and i need you to step up and be the best possible version of me okay
dude honestly im working my nuts off over here
i dont know how to play you any better
then im just gonna have to teach you
lets start at the
dave holds up a suit from his closet
this is called a suit
you have to wear one every day along with holding up tie holding up socks black not white socks holding up dress shoes dress shoes not shower sandals holding up
boxers and underwear
oh come on
no more commando
you are a grown ass man
mitch mimics heiling hitler and starts getting dressed
mitch highly uncomfortable in his business suit scowls as dave shows him the kids schedules on the fridge
this is called a schedule
it tells you everything you need to do in a given day
youll notice that there are approximately hours worth of obligations on any given day
find a way
mitch slumps in the passenger seat grumpy
always be thinking of your next responsibility
it helps to break your day into four minute increments
and remember there is no margin for error
if you pick up the twins the drycleaning and the diaper cream but forget the organic quince paste from that little place on abbot kinney everyone still hates you
you have to be perfect
dave walks mitch through whole foods with a cart selecting various items from the list
this is called a grocery store
you buy food here
before heading to the market always call jamie first and ask her if she needs anything
in fact before you make anv decisions in your life no matter how small call your wife first
think of yourself as a retarded mule lost in the desert helpless dumb and in constant need of direction
never take initiative never strike out on your own never deviate from the plan you are always wrong
you are a retarded mule lost in the desert
they drive down the street the car packed with groceries
when youre with jamie you should always be doing one of three things asking her permission complimenting her or begging her forgiveness
it doesnt matter if she already said you could go to poker night or if she looks like fucking mothra in that dress or if you didnt do anything wrong
permission compliments apologies
thats all anyone wants to hear out of a husbands mouth
here lets practice whats your favorite joke
a rabbi a priest
dave punches mitch in the nuts
no one fucking cares
youre dave lockwood boring dad youre not jerry fucking seinfeld
shut the fuck up
mitch clutches his balls hurt and scared
dave and mitch wearing sombreros sit behind a tiny desk in this colorful pre school classroom preparing the healthy snacks they just purchased for cara and her rowdy classmates
these are called children or dependents
never disparage your own children everything they do is a miracle from god
when theyre bad its only because theyre tired or going through a phase
when other peoples kids are bad however its because of indulgent parenting or innate defects in the a cute little boy snatches three apple slices
one a piece please dylan
kids a natural born criminal
if he sees itll be from the inside a jail cell
dave walks mitch through the office
this is called an office or work
think about whatever you most want to do here and then do the exact opposite
you want to go home early
great stay all night
cool dont eat
think your boss is a total douche
terrific invite him to join your fantasy baseball league
a cute associate walks by and mitch overtly eye fucks her all the way past
dave nut punches him again
youre married now jackass
you cant look at other women you cant talk to other women you cant even be interesting around other women
do everything in your power to de sexualize yourself wear a fannypack drive a passat affix electronic devices to your belt whatever it takes
if youre forced to interact with a woman quickly find a way to mention that youre married
it doesnt even have to make sense
just be like nice weather today im totally fucking married
wait so i cant sleep with my wife and i cant sleep with other women
what is that
its called marriage
dave turns into his office nodding at his mean secretary
good morning gladys
she scowls at him confused whos this guy
then mitch passes and wiggles his tongue at her simulating cunnilingus
the old lady gasps appalled
they enter daves office
do you have any other questions
yeah whens your free time
cock punching him again have you been listening to one word ive said
there is no fucking free time
you dont have a life anymore
you dont have a personality or an identity or a point of view
you are a dad
your job is to allocate resources to shuttle children from a to b to deliver food at appropriate intervals to clean up to break down to construct to repair to
finance to sooth to make everyone else happy okay
and when your day is done you know what you get
youre not single anymore
no one gives you a cupcake every time you hold the door or speak in complete sentences its expected of you now so grow up
okay can i just say something without you punching my cock
dave inhales go i think you might be taking some of this adult shit a little seriously knock knock
both men turn to see sabrina in the doorway looking lovely in a short skirt suit holding documents
hell lo legs
sort of big news
solicitous creepy please come in
entering tentative no
anyway kinkabe and amalgamated have agreed to go into binding mediation in two days
are you kidding me
sabrina glances at dave confused no idea who he is
anyway ill have my briefs on your desk by tonight
stretching leg on desk and ill have my briefs on your chin by tomorrow morning and that is level sexual harassment
thanks sabrina that will be all
oh shit this is sabrina
sabrina looks at dave even more confused
have we met
shaking sabrinas hand oh
im sorry no
im mitch daves completely idiotic friend
nice to meet you
mitch notices their chemistry and immediately blurts out you guys should go out
youre single now mitch remember
and sabrina is stone fucking hot
look at that body
sabrina swimmer in college
you two should go out have a nice steak dinner go dancing at some weird korean nightclub and then fuck on the roof you know what i mean

sabrina and dave stammer sharing a terrorized look
um good i guess
i know for a fact that mitch is free so hell see you there
and honey wear something tight you know what i mean

im gonna go now
sabrina hurries out appalled
dave clutches his forehead oh my god im so fucking fired
no dude youre so fucking laid
you cant talk to women like that at work
or anywhere really
im sorry i just got you a date with the number one girl on your cancer list and this is the thanks i get
im not going on the date mitch
yes you are
yes you are because if you dont i will feedyour children non organic snacks and then introduce them to my extensive girl on horse pornography collection
how do you think jamie will react to that
dave just looks at mitch horrified
why are you doing this to me
because ive seen your life and if you dont loosen up soon you are literally going to die
so go out with this chick
bust a nut
remember why life is beautiful again okay
this actually gets to dave a bit
he frowns fine
also see if she likes to fuck on tuesday nights because you owe me a regular
his work day over mitch strides through the parking lot heading for his car cheerfully waving to various commuters mitch reaches his audi station wagon when dave
mitch turns to see his father mitch sr
what are you doing here
my attorneys in this building
he notices the human stick figures on daves rear windshield labelled for each member of his family
he smiles at them oh what a neat idea
yeah maybe if youre from kansas
your parents are very lucky to have so many grandchildren
quick sharp whats that supposed to mean
how are y
i mean you still have a really fucking cool son right
yes mitch is definitely cool
how are the twins
theyre fucking fine what the fuck does that mean mitch is definitely cool
no its my fault
i spoiled him rotten after his mother passed away but
he trails off clearly not wanting to talk about this
but what dude
spit it out
but now hes a total fuck up
mitch actually gasps
his dad smiles sadly
i mean hes a great guy hes the life of the party but he has no work ethic he has no backbone hell never build a family or a career
or anything of substance like you have
mitch stands there mouth agape just decimated
anyway im sorry to go on and on
hows your lovely wife
mitch starts tearing up and fumbling with the car door
your son is not a fuck up m mr
hes just a late bloomer
his dad looks utterly confused as mitch gets into the car
are you crying
im sorry im just very close to mitch and when people say mean things about him i hurt too he slams the door shut and jerks out of the parking
spot tears pouring down his face
his dad watches on bewildered
mitch angrily drives home trying to stop crying
and then survivors eye of the tiger comes on the radio
mitchs expression slowly turns to steely determination
as eye of the tiger continues playing we hear a baby scream bloody murder
then we hear a second baby join in
finally we hear the worst two words a parent can ever hear
mitch sits bolt upright in bed like rambo totally awake his jaw set and bounds out of bed
mitch aggressively changes the twins diapers
hes doing a terrible job but hes focussed working hard
mitch assembles two baby bottles as the twins sit in the sink screaming
he screams back at them
mitch sits erect on the couch like a navajo warrior feeding the twins his eyes afire
wearing fingerless driving gloves mitch races the twins to day care
he looks like the fucking transporter
mitch blows into the office looking sharp in a business suit
he points at other lawyers amped up not smiling
his old secretary gladys falls in step with him
i need the book corporate law for dummies every season of law order on dvd and blu ray and the biggest fucking coffee you can carry on my desk in
minutes or else youre fired
gladys writes this down on a pad of paper a bit turned on
also get yourself a new haircut and a pair of six inch stripper shoes
its time to take this shit to the next level
mitch studies a legal casebook while chugging coffee
law order plays on the tv in the background
then an alarm sounds on his desk and he races out of his office all business
mitch hurries into the pediatricians office talking on his blackberry phone a twin in each arm a cigarette dangling from his mouth
the receptionist frowns
mitch makes the universal jerking off motion with his hand
mitch races through the supermarket with a cart grabbing items off the shelves like supermarket sweeps
mitch jogs into the crowded auditorium and sits next to jamie
the ballet recital is already in progress
onstage two dozen adorable little ballerinas in pink tutus pile and jete about
jamie points out little cara in pigtails
fuck me shes cute
uh oh here comes the second battement glisse
jamie tenses up
mitch does too
as cara starts her spin nicolette peters goes to push her over and cara calmly grabs her arm flips her over her shoulder and drops her flat on her back
with a loud wham
as nicolette starts crying cara calmly continues dancing like nothing happened
the other girls on stage look pleased
mitch claps and whistles jamie hits him she but is clearly proud of her little girl
a dozen rows ahead of them nicolettes father a huge former linebacker leaps up outraged
mitch hops up equally fired up
the entire auditorium silences
nicolettes father turns
nicolettes father his face beet red starts climbing over people and seats insanely gunning for mitch
mitch bounds over the seats charging right back at him
on stage mrs
kleinmen and all the little ballerinas stand frozen mouths agape watching mitch and nicolettes father claw their way over seats trying to get to each other
nicolettes dad levels him out of frame as we jamie drives along a slight smile on her face
mitch sits shotgun battered and beaten holding an ice pack to his cheek
cara sits in her carseat in the back a bit stunned
well looks like you wont be doing ballet at the rec center anymore
i didnt really like it anyway
whered you learn to ninja flip a girl like that
so whatd we learn from this
always solve my problems with violence
thats right baby
they bump fists
jamie is stunned
no angel thats exactly the wrong lesson
you should never use violence except to defend yourself okay
mitch subtly shakes his head at cara dont listen to her
violence is cool
im not kidding
cara giggles in the backseat
jamie cant help but laugh too
soon theyre all laughing
its a nice moment
i love you daddy
i i love you too angel
jamie smiles over at mitch
tight on mitch as he feels the family love for the first time
he looks touched
even a little proud
then his cell phone rings
he answers it lockwood
i havent been on a first date in over a decade and im drowning in my own fear
ill be right over
of his old apartment to find dave in khakis and a pressed buttondown freaking out in the mirror how do i look
like a fucking tool
step aside mitch throws open the closet and yanks out a pair of jeans
these are called jeans
theyve been very popular with our nations young people for over years
put them on immediately
to a restaurant
mitch punches dave in the nuts he doubles over
shut up and do what i say
we only have hours to make you cool
mitch shows dave how to put gel into his hair
this is called gel or product
use too little and you look like a pedophile cub scout leader use too much and you look persian
neither is a winning hand
dave very nervously applies gel to his hair
dave stands with his pants around his ankles as mitch very delicately shaves his balls with a bic razor
okay normally i would never do this for another man but since were in a rush and technically this is my testicle bag im making a rare exception
always man scape before a first date
it shows a lady that youre clean considerate and american
dont speak it jiggles your sack
exotic sells the most pimped out used cars in la
mitch squeals off the lot in a red ferrari and cruises down the sunset strip music blasting
dave sits shotgun stunned
i cant believe you just charged a ferrari to my discover card
you need to learn to be spontaneous dave
chicks like spontaneous
to women walking by hey ladies
show us your tits
they flip him off
dave is still floored what are we gonna tell jamie
do me a favor dave
relax your butt hole
daves entire body visibly relaxes a bit
you didnt even know it was puckered right
now recline your seat a bit
now take some deep breaths
dave does calming now give me your sunglasses
dave gives him his sunglasses mitch chucks them out the window and hands him his cool ray bans
now just for like three minutes dont be a dad dont be a husband dont be a lawyer just be a dude rolling down sunset strip in a fucking ferrari
with his best friend listening to seal okay
dave looks out the window getting into it
feels good right
after a moment a tear escapes from under daves shades
its okay just let it out
its been so long since i felt cool
i know baby
they cruise for a bit longer then mitch pulls into a car wash
dave looks confused
why are we washing the car
its brand new
were not washing the car david
were getting you mentally physically and spiritually ready for your date
mitch and a very confused dave enter the car wash lobby
i dont have time to cover all the ways in which women have changed since you last dated
mitch stops at the register to pay
various car wash employees keep saying hi to dave weirding him out
como esta mitch
the bottom line is the internet has revolutionized everything
you mean like j date
fuck j date
the internet has changed chicks in three major ways first access and acceptance of pornography has commoditized women and pressured them into becoming sluttier at far younger ages which is
mitch finishes paying and continues through the car wash
second text messaging has de stigmatized the booty call
call a girl at in the morning for sex and its creepy
text her suck wang midnight
and its classy
i have no idea why but again an awesome development
third facebook and other social networking sites have falsely convinced people women included that they are funny interesting and unique
get used to listening waaay more than you used to
chicks are the new dudes they talk about themselves all the fucking time now
practice saying things like you are so different and no really what golden girl would you be
and i love lady gaga too
whats a lady gaga
i dont know its either a pop singer or an energy drink
they arrive at the car wash waiting area
people sit around waiting for their cars many of them young female and cute
okay lets talk to some honeys get your flow going again
so wait why are we at a car wash
the girls are alone bored and old enough to drive its a goldmine
i run game here four to seven times a week
now go on bust a move
come on i talk to women all the time i dont need to practice
and no offense as a married man i probably know how to talk to women better than you do
its not that hard
they just want to be respected and listened to like everybody else
okay daddy day care show me how its done then
dave sighs and crosses to a cute blonde texting nearby
as he draws closer however he starts to tense up
soon hes sweating
its been a long time
by the time he finally reaches the blonde his voice is ridiculously shrill hello there whats your name
she doesnt even look up from her blackberry
daves confidence instantly crumbles
i im sorry im not trying to hit on you
i mean im married so thats not even a thing
w w where are you from
mitch appears and yanks him away
dave looks traumatized was she reaching for her rape whistle
shake it off
being single is like the tour de france its all about quick recovery time
now go on get your groove back youre meeting sabrina in a half hour
of dave trying to chat up various young women at the carwash
your name is dora
like the explorah
you arent familiar with that show
trying to be sexy so what school district do you live in
yikes what do your parents think of all those piercings
and thats the difference between a stroller and a pram
my cars ready
the young woman races off towards her newly cleaned car
dave slumps shit
mitch nods looking at his watch
your times are improving
i forgot how hard it is to be single
as a general rule when youre talking to single women conversation topics to avoid include your wife your children your favorite playgrounds and the wiggles
dave nods hating himself
mitch heads for the ferrari
but this was good
you worked out all your bad game and now youre ready to dominate
mitch rockets down sunset boulevard
dave looks nauseous
i dont feel good about this
relax youre dressed cool your hair is crushing it your ballsack is taut and smooth and youre way better looking than youve ever been
just remember uncle mitchs golden rule of dating
i know always use an alias
no my golden rule of dating is always find the fun
think of it like this for the next two hours youre stuck with this chick
doesnt matter if shes cool or crazy or if she was born with a vagina on her forehead youre stuck so make the most of it
i dated this chick named topaz once who may or may not have killed her father
long story short she looked like miles of bad road and i wasnt interested but i used our time together to learn about incest and the failures of the american
appellate court system
i found it hugely informative and topaz got caught up in my enthusiasm and gave me a crying blowjob on the car ride home so everybody won
the point is find the fun for yourself and great things will follow
dave looks horrified as they roll up to richters a chic steakhouse
mitch hugs a still speechless dave
now go on
make daddy proud
richters is dark elegant romantic
dave sits at a candle lit table anxiously folding and unfolding sugar packets
then sabrina enters looking stunning in a snug red dress and gazes around the restaurant
daves heart skips a beat and he waves her over
she approaches smiling
he awkwardly goes to kiss her cheek while she goes for a handshake
its awkward cute
oh whoop okay
dave stares at her terrified
then he blurts out do you like googoo lady
what is that
i i dont know
i really dont
sabrina smiles politely and looks around for a waiter
dave winces hating himself to the very core of his being
how long have you known dave
m my whole life actually
annnd have you ever seen him act like he did yesterday
what like a total douchebag
dave cant believe it
he loosens up a bit
thats not fair
dave isnt himself right now
i hope he didnt say anything to offend you
i mean he totally did but its fine
i have brothers
dave pours both of them a glass of wine finding his rhythm
you like working with dave
i love it
hes the best
isnt he just
no go on
i actually used to sort of have a crush on him if you must know
i mean hes married so obviously
well im just like dave only way more handsome
dave smiles back his confidence growing as we as they meander through the courses of their meal
weve never seen dave so animated and alive and happy
dave and sabrina exit the restaurant
its a warm night
well i had a great time
oh are we done
what are we lame married people
lets go to a rave
still do that
my friend is spinning afterhours at foxtail if you want
is that with the bikes
sabrina laughs and takes his arm
youre so funny
a line of hipsters wait outside foxtail
holding daves hand sabrina cuts the line kisses the bouncer on the cheek and he lets them inside
dave nods awesome
dave and sabrina get down on the sweaty crowded dance floor
the house music is deafening and the lights are hypnotizing and everyone is having the time of their lives
dave his shirt half open moves sensually in sync with sabrina both of them possessed by the music
theyre inches apart and her dress and hair fly about in all the right ways
foxtail is closed but dave with sabrina on his lap sits in a booth drinking champagne with dj bassnectar and all of his ridiculously cool friends
dave tells a joke and everyone laughs including kiefer sutherland whos sitting next to him kiefer slaps dave five
dave sabrina bassnectar kiefer sutherland and a group of hipsters play poker in kiefers unbelievable downtown loft
music blasts beer bottles litter the table and everyone is having fun
sabrina wins a hand and does a victory dance
dave walks sabrina home along her quaint tree lined street
now that was a first date
for a guy with a poker table in his living room kiefer sutherland is surprisingly bad at poker
im not even sure he understood the rules
then they stop in front of her apartment
its so weird i feel like ive known you for longer than just one night
theres a lull for a kiss
so sabrina moves in and kisses him
its sweet but passionate
when its over dave can barely speak can
can um can i call you sometime
do people still say that
yes and youd better
good night sabrina
good night mitch
she gives him a thoughtful smile then disappears inside
dave waits a second then does a victorious karate chop yes
light floods into mitchs apartment
dave wakes up and looks at the clock
he rolls over and goes back to sleep a smile on his face
dave sits at an outdoor table reading a novel and taking his time with brunch
he sees a businessman wolfing down his food and running off to his car yelling into his cell phone stressed out of his mind
dave smiles and keeps reading
dave sits on the toilet reading his novel and taking a leisurely shit
we hear the clean ker plop of a solid poo hitting the toilet water and dave closes his eyes nice
dave in a dodgers jersey tees off on baseballs in a batting cage
it feels great
dave holding a cross bow and wearing a loincloth has fake sex with his co star on a jungle set their mid sections are conveniently obscured by a giant fern
dave is selling it and when valtan calls cut the whole crew applauds wildly impressed
dave waves them off bashful
looking hip in jeans flip flops and a mildly ironic tee shirt dave breezes into his office to find mitch in a pressed suit intently studying a legal casebook at
well well look whos all growns up
dave crashes on the couch happy
mitch looks annoyed really
open toed sandals at work
are you kidding me
look i cant hang right now okay
ive got the mediation in like ten minutes
dave stands right back up surprised and impressed
well i just wanted t tell you that if you can get a protracted buyout for anything over million dollars take it okay
million you got it
heading for the door also i wanted to thank you for setting me up with sabrina
i cant wait to see her what
you cant you have to wait at least a week
dave reaches for his cellphone as he heads out the door
which reminds me i wanted to call to see if she got the flowers
you sent her flowers after one date
are you retarded
do not get me into a relationship dude
dave is already gone
then you can come out now gladys
a second later gladys in a form fitting suit and a sexy new bob crawls out from under his desk
mitch zips up his pants
look honey i dont think this is gladys yanks him by the tie and gets in his face wild eyed i havent had sex in years
this isnt over tit i su e its over
f fine but can you please stop following me to the bathroom and calling my house late at night and sending me all those filthy emails
its you know deeply disturbing
you need to realize something boy whispering in his ear i fucking own you now
the old lady aggressively makes out with mitch
her tongue roams from his mouth and madly licks his face neck and forehead
eventually they separate
mitch looks stunned
i left you a little souvenir in your pocket
she winks and exits
mitch tentatively reaches into his pocket and pulls out a giant pair of tan granny panties
ive created a monster
a line of limousines roll up to daves building and dozens of stone faced executives from both companies file out
ken kinkabe and a slew of his execs sit on one side of the massive conference table
sitting across from them are ceo ted norton mitch flemming steel iii and a bevy of amalgamated execs
no one speaks
its a corporate staredown
then the mediator erin walsh s enters all business
thank you all for coming
my name is erin walsh and i will be mediating your claim today
mitch makes the im gonna slit your fucking throat gesture to ken kinkabe who recoils what the
the mediation has broken into two separate rooms
the amalgamated team sits in their shirtsleeves waiting in tense silence
papers litter the table
theyve been here a while
a large tray of sandwiches sits half eaten on the sideboard
mitch jams the last piece of a ham sandwich into his mouth swallows it and holds up his hands victorious
sandwiches and diet slices
pay up cocksucker
an exec gives him a dollar bill
mitch waves it in the air and hums the olympic theme song
flemming just glares at him like youre so fired
then the mediator enters
kinkabe agrees in principle to the terms of the sale and valuates your company at million dollars
this is their last and final offer
ill be outside
ceo ted norton looks at flemming intense
its a fair deal
i dont think well get much more out of them
the other execs all nod
then mitch burrrrps fuck that dude you can do better
i beg your pardon
shut your mouth lockwood
look this is just like when youre trying to fuck a jewish girl and she keeps saying no no i dont want to im really drunk and youre not circumcised
but then she keeps making out with you and not getting out of your fiero so you know she really does want it she just needs to be nudged a bit more so she can rationalize it to herself and to her god know what i mean
this is just like that
everyone in the room is speechless
mitch opens another soda
jesus i do not feel good
how is this
if this was really their final offer theyd leave
instead theyre sticking around which means they have more money to spend
ted looks at his execs
its not a terrible point
how much more do you think we can get out of them
fuck it homey go for
do not listen to him ted he is beyond reckless
if we make too large a counter offer we risk driving them away
enh cant hurt to ask
you wouldnt believe the nasty shit i get girls to do just by asking
honestly its revolting
ted looks genuinely torn
he dabs his sweaty brow
seriously does anyone have a pepto
because im gonna throw
finally ted opens the door and says to the mediator tell kinkabe we want an extra million and that is our final offer because were leaving
loudly to his execs fuel the jet
the mediator heads off as the execs start packing up their briefcases bluffing
mitch points at ted
way to show some sack
you had better be right son or else i am most definitely fired
hey me too
he extends his fist
ted ignores him and gathers his things
ted norton and all his execs hurry out of the building briefcases in hand looking ashen
they head for their long line of idling limos
ted hisses to flemming i cant believe we just walked away from million dollars
for the record i did not support mr
they turn to see the mediator jogging out of the building
kinkabe has agreed to the million
the deal is closed
a shocked cheer rises up from the execs
hugs and handshakes all around
ted pumps mitchs hand ecstatic
i owe you my life
helping ridiculously rich people become even more ridiculously rich is why i go to work every day
well you are bar none the best attorney ive ever worked with
fuck ive never really been good at anything before
mitch considers this a second then laughs proud
gimme me a hug you tiny capitalist
mitch hugs ted and lifts him off the ground spinning him
i love you so much
a perfect sunny day game at dodgers stadium
dave and sabrina take their seats behind home plate
these are your grandfathers seats
yeah my familys been coming to dodger games since they moved here from brooklyn in
dave looks at her his amazement only growing
whos your favorite dodger
blown away dave unzips his jacket to reveal a throwback number fernando valenzuela jersey
its too soon to say i love you right
thats against the rules
she laughs and kisses him
smiling dave looks out at the perfect ball field his arm around sabrina he looks profoundly
and then his iphone rings
he answers it mitch planko who the fuck is this
sitting at her desk talking on the phone and doing whippets off a can of reddi wip twenty empty cans litter her desk
this is carla nelson from the los angeles department of parks
oh my god hi
dave steps away to take the call
carla does another whippet
we found that fountain
its in our san pedro warehouse
dave glances back at sabrina
and winces conflicted and
and how long is it going to be there
it ships out tonight for repairs
and after that
doing another whippet no fucking clue dude
dave gets a call waiting beep
okay well thanks carla
clicking over to other line hello
hes walking down the hall of his law firm on the phone as all of his peers step from their offices applauding his victory slapping him on the back shaking
you hear about the fountain
we should probably switch back huh
mitch high fives a co worker
the funny thing is
i was just starting to enjoy your life a little bit
yeah and i was just starting to enjoy yours too
maybe we should keep going
im so glad you said that
im so glad i said that too
your life rocks
i just closed the amalgamated deal for million dollars and for the first time ever people actually respect me
its so weird
word is theyre going to make me partner tonight
i love your life dude
and i love yours
all the free time and the fun activities and im really growing as an actor and i think sabrina might actually have intercourse with me tonight
dude you sent her flowers shes gonna fuck you like a crack whore on rent day
so wait what are we talking about here
staying like this
is it though
mitch bumps fists with smiling co workers
dave watches sabrina cheer after a base hit
its so strange when the change up happened we were so focussed on switching back into our bodies that we didnt even consider that this might be exactly what we
yeah were fucking morons
all right well see ya dave
take it easy mitch
they both hang up surprised smiles on their faces
rain blankets los angeles that night
its an epic storm
the private back room of this upscale beverly hills eatery is filled with the esteemed partners of steel kuhbach mccloud as well as mitch jamie and little cara
everyones dressed to the nines and enjoying fabulously overpriced food and drink
then flemming stands and dings his wine glass
good evening one and all
the room quiets as a projection screen lowers behind him
we are gathered here tonight to celebrate the newest partner in our esteemed firm
for those of you who havent had the pleasure of working with this brilliant young man weve prepared this short mildly embarrassing presentation to introduce him
mitch looks at jamie who smiles conspiratorially
behind the table gladys turns on a projector
some dido song plays as on the screen we start to see photos from daves life
david andrew lockwood was born on february st in palmdale
shots of dave as a baby appear
jamie takes mitchs hand
dave was a sweet diligent hard working little boy
a shot of boyhood dave in a very dorky s little league outfit flashes onto the screen
in high school dave belonged to over clubs and teams and graduated first in his class
shots play of dave in s high school apparel arguing for the debate team wearing a goofy beret at french club etc
jamie smiles at mitch only he looks a little troubled this is not my life
after winning a full scholarship to princeton dave amazingly graduated in just three years
a shot of college age dave getting his diploma appears
and after graduating from yale law school with high honors dave clerked for justice souter on the united states supreme court
a shot of young dave talking with justice souter plays
around the table the partners murmur impressed
mitch grows increasingly uncomfortable shifting in his seat
shortly after dave returned west to marry his lifelong best friend jamie anne johnson
shots roll of dave and jamie on their wedding day laughing
jamie squeezes mitchs hand a happy mist in her eyes
mitch frowns this is not my wife
cara came along first followed by the twins peter and sarah
shots of dave wearing scrubs happily holding his various newborn babies in the hospital flash onto the screen
cara leans over to mitch and whispers look daddy its you and me
mitch forces a tight smile right
and somewhere along the way we were lucky enough to find him
shots roll of dave as a lawyer swearing in at the bar arguing in court and finally celebrating todays victory
the image fades as the lights in the room slowly rise
they were true of him then they are even more true of him now
it is my distinct honor to introduce our newest partner david lockwood
the room breaks into heartfelt applause
mitch squirms hating this
jamie leans over to him im so proud of you baby
you worked so hard for this
mitch winces knowing just how wrong she is
all around him the partners stand applauding
mitch stands a bit dizzy
i im sorry
he hurries off towards the bathroom
everyone looks confused
rain pours down outside
then dave and sabrina soaking wet in their dodgers gear run into the apartment
oh my god im soaking taking in barren apartment wait are you a single guy
dave laughs and throws her a towel from the bathroom
she starts drying her hair
i need a beer and some dry clothes
when dave passes her though she stops him and starts kissing him
maybe just a beer
mitch stands in the restaurants upscale mens room staring at himself in the mirror lost
what am i doing
this isnt my life
good evening mr
he spins to see gladys in the doorway vamping sexy
gladys not now approaching coy im not wearing any bloomers
i thought we talked about not using wham
she throws him against the bathroom wall and starts aggressively undressing him
whats bothering you mr
look gladys i love bathroom sex as much as the next guy but she spits in his face crazy eyed
wiping face a bit scared o okay
well i guess whats bothering me is
i didnt earn any of this you know
gladys rips open his shirt and starts licking his chest downward until she disappears out of frame
and i know what youre thinking mitch not earning things never used to bother you why does it bother you now
and the answer is maybe im growing up
we hear the sound of his pants unzipping
i mean sure i closed the deal today and that felt good but i didnt put in all the years of hard work that got dave to this point you
plus those arent my adorable kids thats not my beautiful wife youre not even my freaky deaky old lady secretary
i want to earn this stuff just then flemming steel iii blows in and stops cold go wide to see that gladys is in the reverse wheelbarrow position her palms
on the bathroom floor her feet against the bathroom wall with mitch between her legs his pants around his ankles
mitch sees his boss and freezes
mitch and gladys disengage and straighten themselves
sir its not my fault
have you forgotten everything you learned in law school
you cant screw a direct hire
how can we possibly make you a partner now
youre completely exposed
we hear a gasp from the doorway
everyone turns to see jamie shes heard the whole thing
mitch quickly zips his pants
i thought you might be having an affair
but not with gladys age ist
jamie you gotta believe me this woman is a predator
you know what
i cant do this anymore
i want you out of the house by the time the kids wake up
she runs off choking back tears
fastening his belt mitch sprints out of the restaurant desperate but jamie is already squealing away in her car
he stands in the rain overcome with self loathing
dave in dry clothes sits on his couch happily drinking a beer and watching sportscenter
he calls into the bedroom
you find anything that fits
then sabrina appears in the doorway wearing one of his old tee shirts and panties
and nothing else
this is all i could find
as she bends over to dim the lamp her tee shirt rides up exposing her perfectly tan arched back
hyperventilating to himself please dont come please dont and then he stops short
on sabrinas lower back is a cute tramp stamp tattoo of a butterfly
oh my god a many spotted skipperlinq
and everything comes rushing back
his entire life
he looks overcome with emotion
sabrina notices as she slides onto the couch with him
is everything okay baby
yeah no i just
dave rubs his temples overwhelmed
i cant do this
just then the door flies open and soaking wet hysterical her mascara running all over
dave is cheating on me
dave quickly covers his hard on with a pillow
no im not
im so not
how could you lie to me mitch
weve known each other for
then jamie sees scantily clad sabrina and stops
who is this chick
stammering pointing umm
this just got very complicated
im sorry im jamie the wife of one of mitchs friends
wait jamie lockwood
you know the prick
yeah we work together
he cheated on you
yes with his secretary gladys
of all the women in the office he picked her
slightly awkward beat
look jamie i didnt know about gladys i swear
but im sure she means absolutely nothing to dave
no more excuses
the next time you see my asshole husband tell him that i will never
take him back you got that
dave nods quickly terrified
it was nice to meet you
barely holding it together jamie wheels and exits slamming the door behind her
dave just stands there holy shit
mitch sadly packs childrens snacks and capri suns into a duffel bag in the darkened kitchen hating himself
mitch turns to see cara small and fragile in the doorway
what are you doing
oh angel its nothing
im just going away for a little while
confusing grown up stuff try me
im leaving because im a fuck up
do you know what a fuck up is
like uncle mitch
well i thought this time was different you know
i thought i actually did something right for once
but no im still the same old fuck up ive always been
only this time i really fucking fucked up because i fucked up my life and my best friends life
mitch zips up his bag full of regret and finds cara hugging his leg
i dont think youre a fuck up
he crouches down and looks at her getting choked up
thanks sweetie but your brain is the size of a radish
i am a fuck up
i always have been and i always will be
guys like me we know how to have fun but we dont know how to do the important stuff you know
be good okay kiddo
she nods confused
he kisses her head and exits emotional
the rain still pours down
jamie tears streaking her face drives home in stop and go traffic
then through her side window we see dave sprinting alongside her car waving
not seeing him she accelerates forward and dave disappears from view
until she stops and dave catches up again still not seeing him jamie accelerates onto where the stop and go traffic moves only slightly faster
jamie continues quietly crying to herself
then we see in the driving rain waving his hands and yelling
finally she glances over sees dave and startles mitch
jamie stunned pulls onto the shoulder and stops
a second later dave hops into the car soaking wet and panting
what is the matter with you
look i know i havent been a very good husband or father recently
what are you talking about
but im done looking over the fence for something better
ive seen whats on the other side and its great
but its not you
and the truth is there will always be another fence with shinier toys on the other side but the only way to be happy is to say fuck the fence
and just appreciate what you have you know
find the fun with what you got
im so sorry i stopped appreciating you pumpkin
i love you
and i love our weird little kids
and i cant believe i ever thought that wasnt enough
are you calling me pumpkin
and then he kisses her
she resists mitch
but he holds her firm
and soon shes kissing him back confused and overwhelmed and crying
its emotional and intense for him too
they finally separate but remain inches apart breathing hard
jamie stares into his eyes amazed dave
jamie squints trying to understand
dave shakes his head i dont know
mitch was the one
dave nods again
jamie looks relieved
then she stops
wait so who was that hot young thing back in the apartment
nothing happened i swear
but were going to need to talk about this
like a lot
like a therapy lot
absolutely therapy trust falls the landmark forum eat pray love ill do whatever the fuck you want jamie i just want you back
she smiles and kisses him again
and then again
i kind of like kissing mitch
yeah i noticed
im not sure how i feel about this
giggling kissing him again so
so what do we do now
dave suddenly remembers the fountain and looks at his watch
we gotta go
as the rain tapers off jamie rockets through la running red lights skidding through turns splashing through puddles
jamie and dave squeal up to their house to see mitch out front sadly trying to pack a barcalounger into his ferrari
squinting inside car is that jamie
get in the fucking car dipshit
mitch terrified sprints to the car and hops in
jamie races through la at mph
dave sits shotgun and mitch sits in the back wide eyed scared so um are you guys driving me to the desert to kill me
jamie knows about the change up
were all good
it suddenly makes a lot more sense why you spent so much time rubbing my breastfeeding cream onto my boobs every night
i was just
trying to be helpful
oh and what about that time you
you know what
i dont want to know
lets just hope we get to the warehouse before they ship off our fountain
off daves concerned look we the port of los angeles never sleeps
huge diesel cranes load and unload freighters as tractor trailers thunder to and fro
the street is lined with warehouses
then jamie skids around the corner tokyo drift style in her station wagon
there it is
jamie screeches up to a warehouse labelled l
department of parks she mitch and dave pile out of the car and run into where they sprint down the towering aisles past park signs swingsets jungle gyms and finally
four workmen pack the fountain of metis into a large wooden crate for transport
jamie mitch and dave run over to them
the workmen stop packing the fountain confused
we need that fountain
need this fountain
we have to pee in it
its a magic fountain
the workmen just look at them deadpan
then dave reaches into his wallet and starts pulling out cash with their pants down around their ankles
dave starts peeing
dave hisses at him come on open the floodgates
i cant pee with them watching
pan over to the workmen standing nearby looking at mitch and dave like theyre total freaks
well i cant keep going forever
mitch tilts his head back and quietly sings to himself the sun is shining all the time looks like another perfect day i love l
we love it
i love l
are you singing randy newman
then we hear a second stream of pee hit the fountain
oh thank god
okay quick we have to hug
glancing back at workmen do we though
yes we have to do everything exactly the same
as they scootch together and put their arms around each other mitch calls over to the workmen just so you know this isnt gay
our penises arent even touching
come on i wish i had my old life back on three
one two i wish i had my old life i wish i had my old life back
the lights in the warehouse flicker
dave and mitch finish peeing and slowly zip up exchanging a worried look
you think it worked
how the fuck should i know
waving to workmen thank you
have a pleasant evening
then we hear a baby scream bloody murder
then we hear a second baby join in even more shrill than the first
finally we hear the worst two words a parent can ever hear your turn
dave turns on the light rushes over to the mirror and touches his face overjoyed clearly back in the right body
oh thank god
pumpkin it worked
groggy half asleep great go feed the fucking babies
she rolls over and goes back to sleep
he grins and runs out
dave cheerfully sings as he changes sarahs diaper
you just vomited on my hand but i love yooooou
dave bounces down the hallway a twin in each arm screaming into each of his ears and taking turns kicking his balls
and hes grinning
in fact he couldnt look happier
mitch slowly wakes up in his empty apartment
he stares at the blank walls a little bummed
then he startles when sabrina rolls over looking ravishing
last night was weird
are you ever going to have sex with me
yes i am
jamie is cleaning up the toys in the living room when dave nuzzles up to her from behind seductive
the twins are down for their nap cara is watching the backyardigans
jamie raises her eyebrow oh
its tuesday morning
tuesdays wednesdays mornings late night im like dennys baby im open
she laughs and he scoops her up and heads upstairs
the sun sets over la
the music in the air and the cars lining the street tell us that dave is hosting a party
a congrats on getting a job mitch
banner hangs from the swingset
kids race about as adults drink eat and mingle
dave in jeans and a tee shirt works the barbecue and talks to mitch in a jacket and tie as he adjusts his crotch i still cant get used to
the whole underwear thing
