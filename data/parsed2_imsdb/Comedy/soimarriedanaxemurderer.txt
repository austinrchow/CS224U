screenplay by robbie fox over this we hear a recording of jack kerouacs poem san francisco which is accompanied by a be bop trio
kerouacs poetry coincides with the various shots of san francisco
we come to a sign for jack kerouac street
we pan over to the city lights bookstore and continue along to the alleyway where there is a large high contrast black and white sign depicting jack kerouac in his
famous im looking into the distance having a brilliant thought pose
charlie mackenzie in his late twenties wearing a flannel shirt and torn jeans walks into the frame right in front of the picture of jack kerouac and inadvertently strikes the
exact same pose
we pull back to reveal that charlie has a bag of garbage in his right hand which he deposits in the alleyway
we follow charlie into
we follow him through the store
by day he is the assistant manager by night he is a poet
a man in his fifties wearing a beret and a goatee is reading charles bukowskis playing the piano like a percussive instrument until your fingers begin to bleed a bit
charlie takes his place behind the cash register and resumes writing in his handsome leather bound poetry journal
sotto customer approaches
do you have the book on the road by jack kerouac
every day there is a steady stream of tourists who come in to get copies of on the road
charlie is use to this and without looking up he points to a huge well marked display of thousands of copies of on the road
another tourist couple approach
do you have a copy of on the road by jack kerouac
again not looking up charlie just points
charlie puts the closed sign on the door and proceeds to walk home
the sights and the sounds of the city are accentuated by the bebop as he sees life warts and all
as the streets become less populated he can now hear the sounds of his own footsteps and a couple bickering
the streets become even more deserted
the night is closing in on him
a cat darts out from an alleyway and startles him
he quickens his pace
rumblings make him cross the street to avoid the danger
headlights of a slow moving car approach from the distance
charlie frightened turns another corner onto he approaches a story victorian home in which he has an apartment on the second floor he notices a light on in his window
a crashing sound from within
taking papers out of a desk drawer
carefully opening the front door and then gingerly closing it
he reaches for a baseball bat in a nearby umbrella stand
sound of breaking glass from his apartment upstairs
with a photo of charlie and an angelic blonde
finishing off the last two steps nearing the front door of his apartment bat raised above his head ready to swing
clasp a jewelry box on the top of the dresser and stuff them into a dufflebag the jewelry is followed by cds
pushing open his apartment door in a mock swat maneuver then stealthily stalking toward the sound of the intruder in the bedroom
he stubs his toe on a spring loaded doorstop making a loud metal vittswinggggs sound
he freezes terrified
where the hands freeze
like a coiled jungle cat ready to pounce waits two beats
then springs samurai style into
that the hands belong to the angelic blonde in the broken picture
its charlies girlfriend sherri
what are you doing
im leaving you
oh thank god
i thought you were robbing our own home because frankly thats insane
i mean what could you possibly gain by robbing your own home
i dont mean to meddle but isnt it better to rob other peoples homes
start accumulating their wealth as opposed to just reaccumulating your own wealth
thats not funny charlie
im really leaving
she continues to pack
charlie tries to unpack her things
just because we had a fight last night
weve had a fight every night for two months
ever since i brought up the subject of marriage youve found fault with everything i do
why couldnt we have gotten married charlie
beat im too young to get married
begins putting her things back im only twenty nine and a half
we love living together
its been two years now
i need something more
see sherri this is frustrating for me okay
when we first started going out i thought we agreed that we werent the sort of people who got married
thats like saying were not the sort of people who are going to grow old
were not going to fall into that growing old trap
face it youve got a problem with commitment charlie
take a look at your other girlfriends
every time you get close to a commitment theres something wrong with them
hey i broke up with them for good reasons
what about sandy
sandy was an alcoholic
no no no
you thought she was an alcoholic
she just drank more than you drank
what about jill
she hated my family
you thought she hated your family
nobody hates your family
everybody loves your family
what about julie
she smelled like soup
what does that mean
she smelled exactly like campbells beef vegetable soup
she was dirty physically dirty
well charlie i wonder what youre gonna say were my problems
are you gonna tell your friends that i was a junkie that i wasnt supportive enough or that i smelled like relish
charlie i loved you
it could have worked out
she goes to the door think about it
charlie and his best friend tony spiletti are out for a night on the town
tony is second generation italian american with very mediterranean features
theyre listening to teenage fan club
they pass ghierardeli square
tony teenage fan club theyre scottish you know
i had that dream again
oh is that the one where you suspect that a fat man in a diaper on a lazy susan has interfered with your plans for the evening
no but i have had that one
no in this one im in love
and i say to myself ive finally found somebody that im truly comfortable with
you know when youre so comfortable that youll let them put makeup on you to see what you would look like if you were a girl
anyways you know what i do in the dream next
after a pause no
but charlie youre a normal suburban guy at heart from a normal suburban family
didnt you tell me you always wanted to get married and have a family
yes but im afraid okay
there are seven main rites of passage in a mans life
birth first day of school last day of school
im at marriage
im two rites of passage away from death
im sorry i wasnt listening
tony is doing three sixties scoping out beauties when suddenly his roving eyes lock on a police car directly behind them
he slouches down into his seat
its the cops
tony you are a cop
isnt it awful
i work with those guys
the police car passes
tony and charlie enter
there is a poet on stage
the club is full of art tarts and college bohemians
they are greeted by the clubs owner giuseppi an italian man in his fifties
salve zio mio
che catzo fai charlie
hi uncle giuseppi
tony come stai bello il tuo pappa e in galera per la terza volta
tonys uncle shows them to a table
ill have the waitress bring you cappuccino
what did your uncle say
he says my dads back in jail again
ah im sorry man
you know its funny i dont even feel related to my parents anymore
i feel like your mom and dad are more like my parents
i feel more scottish than italian
tony spiletti i dont think you could get more italian than that
unless of course your name was tony italian guy
charlie checks out the girls in the coffee bar
im so bummed
sherri was great wasnt she
im an asshole arent yes
youve got to help me get through this night
youve just got to get back on the horse
the waitress arrives with two cappuccinos in extremely large cups like they have in france
waitress im sorry there seems to be a mistake
i ordered the large cappuccino
two girls at a nearby table laugh
charlie and tony exchange this could be promising
to the girls do you think these cups could be larger
theyre practically bowls
the girls laugh again
i feel like im having campbells cuppuccino
join us in a cup of coffee
theres enough room
the girls come over
my names susan and this is june
we think youre funny
my names tony
this is my friend charlie
look tony im going home
see you later girls
tony grabs him and pulls him aside
you really dont understand do you
when a girl comes over to your table and says i think youre funny
it means youve pretty much been given the keys to the city
charlie this is big
perhaps youve confused me with someone who gives a shit
heres whats gonna happen tony
well end up going out with them tonight maybe even home with them
well go out for two months
soon shell move in well be happy shell want more of a commitment
ill be terrified and ill do something to ruin it
just like i did with sherri
tony is left with the two girls
he seemed so nice
talking choked up i just broke up with somebody as well
she left me high and dry
the girls try to comfort him
three quarters of the furnishings and items have disappeared with sherri
charlie sits dejectedly on the floor over his poetry journal
he is missing sherri
he looks out and is struck by an idea and begins to write
again he looks out finds his inspiration and continues to write a gentle tear rolls down his left cheek
he pauses then finishes off the stanza
after the last line he scratches out the entire poem
he closes the book and turns on the tv set to cnn to veg out
the show is whats cooking
with burt wolf
charlie is driving in his car
he drives slowly looking for an address
finds it slips in to a parking spot in front
adorning the front are a grand opening sign and miniature flags of the world
charlie goes inside
its a small hip shop selling specialty meats from around the world
charlie looks around
suddenly an attractive woman in her late twenties wearing a blood stained smock enters
it is harriet michaels
she has a cleaver in one hand and something bloody in the other
angry goddamn shoplifter
conscious of charlies presence holding up bloody meat but i got him
smiles youre next
backing out the door terrified ive come at a bad time
no no really
obviously youve got things you have to do
youve got to dismember the rest of his bloody torso
dig a makeshift shallow grave
cover the body with quick lime
really so much to do so little time and im only in the way here im just gonna go
referring to meat in hand oh this
oh no this is what he stole
this isnt a piece of him or anything
this is icelandic shank
i bet it goes well with a nice chianti
laughs can i help you
do you have haggis
yes we do
its over here in our scottish cuts section
this is a section under glass flying a scottish flag with haggis and various cuts of scottish meat
ive never been able to find haggis anywhere except at my parents house
harriet rounds the counter and wraps up the haggis
behind her is the large prussian venison sign
ringing up his order thatll be fifteen seventy nine
will there be anything else
i know its a long shot but you wouldnt by any chance happen to have any prussian venison
now where in the world would i get prussian venison
charlie is driving along listening to kerouac
we absorb the flavor of san francisco as he drives down lombard street
an old crappie apartment building in san francisco
charlies car pulls up
we hear saturday night by the bay city rollers
charlie approaches a door
calling up mom dad im here
were in here son
the apartment is a shrine to scotland
scottish paraphernalia miniature scotty dogs shortbread tins and on wall framed pictures depict famous scotsmen sean connery jackie stewart alexander graham bell james doohan scottie from star trek sheena easton
we see stuart may tony and little william charlies fourteen year old little brother all singing singing noticing charlie come give your old man a kiss or ill kick your
the group are eating dinner on tv trays
charlie walks over and turns off the record
charlie put on charlie pride would ya
oh i love charlie pride
begins singing in thick scottish accent may shut it
stuart mackenzie is in his late fifties a butcher with coke bottle glasses and thick head of black hair
his red haired wife may is in her fifties attractive with a soft but tough appearance
little william has a very large head and a skinny neck
like charlie he was born in america
charlie gives his mom a hug his father a kiss
on his stomach on the floor watching hey charlie
on the television stuarts team glasgow celtic has scored
lets have a look at the re play
william move your head
look at the size of that ooys heed
im not kidding
its like an orange on a tooth pick
stuart youre going to give the boy a complex
im not kidding
thats a huge noggin
it has its own weather system
its a virtual planetoid
shouting to william heed
we see the re play of the goal on tv
tony sits down and may brings over a plate of stew and three types of potatoes piled very high
is that enough potatoes charlie
enough to recreate devils tower in close encounters
sniffs the air do i smell haggis
aye you do
taking it ill put it in the frig
charlie notices tony reading some papers
he realizes its literature from the lyndon h
dad what are you doing to tony now
why do you abuse his mind like this
thats the latest report from lyndon h
larouche outlining how the queen and the rothschilds masterminded the soviet overthrow so that they could reclaim lands they had annexed during the holy roman empire
goading charlie you know a lot of this makes sense
i think youre suffering from the stockholm syndrome where the hostages start to relate to their captors
listen sonny jim its a known fact theres a society of the five wealthiest people in the world called the pentaverate who run everything and meet three times a year
at a secret country mansion in colorado known as the meadows
sarcastic and thats obviously why we havent heard about it in the newspapers
inappropriately angry loud thats right
they fuckin own the papers smartass
and everything else
why do you think scotlands not been able to get independence
because the queen the pentavirate and those english dome heads in west minster wont have it
who are the other members of this pentaverate
the queen the rothchilds the gettys the vatican and colonel sanders before he went tits up
oh i hated the colonel with his wee beady eyes
and that smug look on his face
dad how can you hate the colonel
because the colonel puts an addictive chemical in it that makes you crave it fortnightly
coo coo would anyone like a juice
charlie did i tell you we bought a juice tiger
a juice tiger
aye its a juicer
its part of my national enquirer garth brooks diet
would you like potato juice
thank you no
yeah uh sherri and i broke up
oh you didnt
sherri was the daughter your father was never able to give me
im just not ready for marriage
im twenty nine and my poems havent even been published yet
but its not just the poetry is it son
youre afraid if you get married youll lose your muse
look at me i was a strapping young butcher at the height of my creative powers
when it came to de boning a side of beef there was nobody that could touch me
then i married your mother
and people would still stand in awe as i filleted a shoulder of lamb
maybe its just as well not to get married look at the news
where did i put it
move that melon of yours into the bathroom and get the paper for your mother
william gets the national enquirer and brings it back
thats not news dad
i wouldnt wipe my ass with that paper
what are you talking about
its the fifth highest circulating paper in the united states ill have you know
oh here it is
the honeymoon murderer
she marries men under fake identities and then murders them
she killed some german martial arts expert and some plumber named ralph elliot
her whereabouts are unknown
theres another goal on the tv set
ah beautiful goal
we hold on the tv set
the tv set the two teams are shaking hands
and the final scores chyron shows celtic beating rangers three nothing
we see charlie and tony are leaving
stuart is blind drunk
singing rod stewarts song ah youre steaming
she meets charlie and tony at the door and kisses him good bye
she turns to kiss tony and holds on the kiss far too long
pulling away see you later mrs
oh youve turned into a sexy italian bastard
see you later mom
calling out see you later dad
youve stayed your hour
charlie and tony leave and enter
where they find william sitting on the stairs waiting for them
take me with you
charlies drives by and notices harriet whos unwinding the store awning in dutch national costume
the banner announces charlie slows down to look at her
she looks great in her little dutch costume
charlie is again writing at the counter
another person enters
you wouldnt happen to have
charlie again points to the kerouac section without looking up
shes on his mind
charlies car pulls up
the sign reads welsh week meats the store is very busy
there is a line at the meat counter seven people deep
charlie takes his place at the end of the line
we see a montage of a persons hands chopping a rack of lamb into lamb chops and carving meat with surgical efficiency
spotting charlie in the crowd oh hi haggis right
it was a big hit
finishing up with a customer i remember you told me you were scottish but do you really like haggis
i think its repellent in every way
in fact i think most scottish cuisine is based on a dare
to the next customer can i help you
to charlie sorry im really busy
look um my dads a butcher do you need a hand
well actually yes
charlie puts on a very stylish butcher smock and crosses behind the counter
can you get me four belgian porterhouses
do you know what a porterhouse looks like
im meat literate
time passes we see a montage of harriet and charlie serving customers
ending on a customers pov of charlie
yes do you have any fresh blubber
pause you want blubber right
we see charlies pov of an eskimo with a lower forty eighth accent
my parents are coming to town
you know how parents are
theyll drive you nuts
the eskimo exits there are no customers left
look im really grateful
can i offer you some meat as payment
please help yourself to some meat
im trying to be a vegetarian
trying to be a vegetarian
yeah the problem is i really love hot dogs
i think the meat industry invented hot dogs to stop people from becoming vegetarians
theres got to be something i can do to repay you
you could take me to a nice romantic dinner
charlie and harriet are eating hot dogs
as charlie puts the relish on he smells the relish
sniffing the relish this reminds me of my ex girlfriend
i hate talking about old relationships
then lets not and say we did
she laughs that was easy what a nice guy
youve probably never done a mean thing in your life
youd be surprised
id like to hear
to his confused look name me something bad youve done in your life
are you kidding me
did you ever steal anything
you ever hit someone
well ive been in fights
let me think
as charlie thinks not one bad thing charlie
tell me something bad youve done
and it better be bad
i mean evil
thinks like how many people have you brutally murdered
brutal is such a subjective word
i mean whats brutal to one person might be totally reasonable to another
next to them is a german couple speaking german looking through a coin operated binocular
he says something which causes her to cry
this just reminded her of that scene in brians song
actually he just proposed to her
those are tears of joy
she lifts her soda to toast them
the man and woman smile and nod
youre very smart
its a shame im going to have to destroy you
do bright women intimidate you
no not at all
really what do you look for in women you date
thinks well i know everyone always say sense of humor but id have to go with breast size
she laughs how about you
in a guy
income of course and then
he smiles at her
me likey how you thinkey
the lights turn on and then they enter a very bohemian apartment
there is artists paraphernalia strewn around
a small bar separates the living area from the kitchen
she smiles and walks off into the kitchen
ill make us some tea
he checks out her apartment
on the wall there is a huge poster of the boardwalk in atlantic city
hey you know what this apartment needs
a really large oversized poster of atlantic city
i used to live there
thats where i had my first supermarket job
on his way out he peeks into the bedroom where he finds a bed that is facing neither parallel nor perpendicular with the wall
it is just kind of there
coming into room i only have chamomile
i hope thats all right
he looks at her and then at the oddly placed bed
its north south
to his confused look for health reasons
i had this friend he was a martial arts expert
anyways he used to sleep north south
i dont know
its a martial arts thing and it just sort of became a habit with me
walking into living room you know scotland has its own martial arts
its called fucku
its mostly head butting and kicking people when theyre on the ground
harriet starts laughing
then so does charlie
they lean into each other
too close even and when it seems like theyre going to kiss charlie suddenly gets uncomfortable and looks at his watch
not for me
who for then
who for then what
well you looked at your watch and said it wasnt late for you
i wondered who it was late for
after a pause checking watch maybe it is late
she gets him his coat
he starts to leave
look the truth is yes i had a great time and id like to kiss you but if we do kiss then well kiss on the couch and if we
kiss on the couch then well kiss in the bedroom and once youre in the bedroom well the thing is i always rush it
and this time i feel like maybe i should wait
maybe we should let it build naturally and grow instead of just immediately spending the night together
i want to spend the night together
sold i have no problem with that
they are both fast asleep
she is curled up in his arms
suddenly she begins to speak
charlies eyes open
charlies smile fades
he sits up and looks at her
she is lying completely still on the bed her eyes closed and still sleep talking
now now ralph
waking her harriet
as her eyes open you were having a dream or
you kept saying the name ralph
i heard you say it
sleepily thats odd
just today i was thinking about her
shes a friend
starting to leave is she nice
charlie is sleeping alone in the bed and the sound of running water is heard off in the distance
his eyes slowly open he looks around remembers where he is
he puts on his shorts and walks towards the bathroom
through the steam we can just make out harriet in the shower washing her hair
charlie walks over
with this drought in california total strangers are urged to shower together
he opens the curtain
its not harriet
the woman rose calmly looks at him and closes the curtain
he backs out of the room
the door opens and a hurriedly dressed charlie emerges
before he gets to the door he once again encounters rose
shes completely dressed
even her hair is dry
im really sorry
i must have scared the
im harriets friend charlie and you must be
im harriets sister rose
and this is harriets note
he reaches for it but she reads it aloud to him
reading dear charlie i didnt want to wake you make yourself at home thanks for making me smile
thats a very nice note
ill make you some breakfast
gee id love to but im running late
what would you say to blueberry pancakes bacon fresh squeezed grape juice and kona coffee
charlie and rose sit at the table each eating a bowl of dry cereal
im sorry i didnt have any of those other things
hey that stuffll kill you while fruit loops are light and probably reasonably high in fiber
i like apple jacks too
so this is your apartment
rose starts sketching charlie
shes been here the past three months
ever since she came back from miami
i used to visit her occasionally
she didnt speak of me
shakes his head no she told me about a martial arts guy and there was some discussion about ralph
she spoke of them
she spoke of the martial arts guy and screamed about ralph
affectionately well you know harriet
actually i really dont
puzzled but you did have sex with her
taken aback hello
yet you still dont know her
contemplates this see thats the problem with sex
its not very revealing
my look at the time
he stands up
after a pause you should be careful charlie
you should know this is very unusual that i would do this so soon in this day and age particularly but
we just really hit it off
im gonna go now
i wont tell harriet that anything happened
nothing did happen
or she would be jealous
and when she gets jealous we both know what shes capable of
no we dont
you do like i said i just met her
youll be okay charlie
just be careful
charlie is baffled
as charlie walks by fred a lanky customer in his late teens is buying a book
how you doin
leaning in you got a lot of girlfriends right
you know any girls named ralph
isnt that a guys name
well not necessarily but
charlie catches the store manager penny on her way into her office
hey penny i wanted to ask you you know some girls named ralph right
i mean thats a girls name also isnt it
confused i dont think so charlie
walking away forget it
she walks into her office totally confused
tony and charlie are waiting in line
as they travel to the island
you know ive lived in this city all my life and ive never been to alcatraz
we open on the loud banging of a cell door
we find our tour group in the holding area
the park ranger is a beefy man in his late fifties and talks with emotionless military precision
hello everyone im a park ranger and i will be leading you on the tour
all the park rangers here at alcatraz were at one time guards myself included
my name is john johnson but everyone here calls me vicki
will you please follow me
they are led out
we see that alcatraz is a sinister place
cold and unforgiving
the park ranger leads them to the center of a cell block
youre glowing charlie
the mans in love
im trying to listen
this is the main cell block area
home to such famous criminals as al capone micky cohen joseph dutch critzer and robert stroud the famous bird man of alcatraz
follow me please
the park ranger leads them past the famous visiting rooms the mess hall all the way to the solitary confinement area
this is the cell for solitary confinement that over the years has come to be known as times square
tony and charlie are at the back of the tour group
so did you and harriet
grinning sssh i dont want to talk about it
with that look you dont have to talk about it
the grin alone could get you five to seven years
tony get your mind out of the gutter
all you need to know is that shes a sweet kind and loving person
now this is something none of the other tour guides will tell you
in this particular cell block machine gunn kelly had what we call in the prison system a bitch
and one day in a jealous rage kelly took a makeshift knife or shiv and cut out his bitchs eyes
look what can i tell you
im in deep smit
i just dont wanna talk about it because then i start analyzing and thats not good for me
i think thats good
just let it happen
thats whats gonna be different this time
something strange happens let it go
its not my business
she says ralph in her sleep
i dont know who ralph is
moreover i dont want to know
and as if blinding his bitch wasnt enough retribution for kelly the next day he and four other inmates took turns pissing into the bitchs ocular cavity
tony and charlie look at each other
theyre a little queasy
beat tony im happy
dont let me screw this one up
they are eating bay burrites
did you have a nice date last night
rose i dont really he disturbed me while i was naked in the shower this morning
yeah he stayed over
i didnt mind
charlie and i laughed about it over breakfast
he said you had great sex last night
a beat yeah
he seems really stuck on you
i hope for you that it lasts
rose hes a sweet kind and loving person
we like each other but i dont want to think any further
its taken me a long time to get back to dating and i want to take things real steady this time
well you can trust me not to tell him anything
he was quite happy not to talk about the past
i did a sketch of him
rose shows the sketch to harriet
looking at the picture thats good
think ive caught him
the eyes are good
charlie really liked it
its a good likeness
boy i really hope it works out
rose i dont wanna screw this one up
charlie enters the building holding a handful of poetry books
he passes a uniformed delivery guy coming out
the guy nods and charlie nods back
charlie gets three feet down the hallway
stops in his tracks and heads back to the front door
he opens it and yells to the delivery guy hey uh
turning around im gilbert
she opens the door enough to see that she is wearing only a blouse that goes below her hips
she looks fantastic
he hands her the poetry books
teasing him charlie theyre beautiful
ill put them right in water
he follows her inside and puts the books on the bureau
he goes over and kisses her
you look great
i was just getting dressed
picking up skirt off couch what do you think of this skirt
pulls her close id leave it off
so then you think i could go to a poetry concert like this
she drops the skirt and stands there
lets forget the poetry concert
its already been nine hours since i last made love to you
smiling walking away come on were meeting your best friend
i wanna look good
the second i go to the ladies room hes gonna tell you what he really thinks of me
he follows her to the bedroom door constantly trying to kiss her
come on charlie
we have to be there in fifteen minutes
following her into bedroom fifteen minutes
she closes the door on his face
through door maybe later
i thought of calling you
charlie turns on his heel
rose has appeared out of nowhere
after a pause to warn you charlie
after a pause there are just some things you should know about harriet
about her past
i dont wanna know
i mean look everyone has some skeletons in their past
i only care about the future
not the past
heres the thing
i may have to tell harriet
tell her what
that were lovers
were not lovers
i know and its a damn shame
harriet walks in the room fully dressed and fully dazzling
i hope im not interrupting
feeling weird no not at all
we were just talking about
rose and i met yesterday so
so i heard
harriet hugs rose and then stands right next to her
so dont you think we look alike
oh we do not
harriet was always prettier than me
and a heck of a lot more popular
she always had boyfriends
the only thing i ever got was good grades
slightly uncomfortable good grades are good
shes just being kind
show charlie one of your photographs rose
rose is a great artist
i dont want to
theyre not good
youre so modest
if i werent here to brag for you i just dont know
taking out a posterboard from cabinet show it to him rose
he turns it over and there is a picture there
a collage of unrelated images put together
and it is beautiful
but its very abstract
he likes it
what is it
what do you call it
a lot artists dont like to title their work
they feel it biases the viewer
it is titled
its called i dunno
charlie looks at it again then at rose then at harriet
its all a little bizarre but in a funny way he feels for rose
a hidden talented overshadowed by her sisters beauty
we should get going charlie
see you later
rose great to see you
we should all go out together some time
the three of us
that would be great
that would be
charlie and harriet walk out
charlie and harriet wait in line with bohemian types and poetry lovers from the suburbs and all walks of life
directly behind them are two old ladies
the marquee reads i think youre going to love alan ginsberg
oh i know all about him
tony is getting out of a cab accompanied by susan the girl from spilettis coffee house
he approaches charlie
sorry were late
tony throws his arms wide open and hugs one of the little old ladies on the other side of charlie
you must be harriet
ive heard a lot about you
to tony re harriet this is harriet
whispering to harriet i apologize
charlie described you as much older
smiling oh he did
thank you tony
this is my best friend
and this is susan
charlie you remember her from uncle giuseppis
yes i do
then she giggles
the girls start inside tony lags back with charlie
whispers to charlie i give susan one night
allen ginsberg is on stage
he is brilliant
tony charlie and harriet are all amused
susan is bored stiff
charlie is looking at tony
tony glances over at susan and gives charlie an oh well
then he looks at harriet and nods in approval of her
the four of them walk along the wharf
charlie is at one of those arcade games where you throw bean bags at the puppets and try and knock them down
charlie knocks two down
one more and you get your pick
to harriet you do it
im the worst
come on youll be great
the arcade man turns around to watch
harriet winds up and throws the bean bag directly into his neck
i told you charlie
no no youre okay youre just having control problems
they both start laughing
he puts his arm around her
in the b
the wounded arcade man is being led away by a co worker
they continued down the boardwalk stand in front of a house of horrors
it looks somewhat run down and harriet looks questioningly at charlie
i know this is really really cheesy but in a way this is one of the places in san francisco im most proud of
yeah lets go in
tony nods agreement
susan looks bored
they go inside the its as low rent as charlie described
the keeper of the threshold so described in a poorly written sign is an overweight man in his late twenties wearing jeans and a denim jacket and a little bit
of scary makeup
he looks like a roadie for the band kiss
he stands at a podium smoking and reading a paper
as charlie tony harriet and susan pass the threshold keeper he takes a casual drag of his cigarette lets out a little smoke and with zero commitment utters boo
harriet and charlie enter bills wax museum
the owner of the wax museum greets them
im bill welcome to my wax museum
they walk over to the exhibits
there are exhibits of abraham lincoln michael jackson and dolly parton
as they look more closely they notice that the faces are exactly the same as bills
charlie and harriet wrapped in each others arms walking through the rain
i feel so safe with you right now
youre never going to leave me are you
i feel like i could be here forever
pull back to see charlie in bed
he lies awake on his side his back up to harriets
she is sound asleep
suddenly sleeptalking ralph
charlie sighs then just shrugs and tries to fall asleep
what can he do
charlie and harriet wait outside his parents door
well this is it
itll be fine
they enter the door
we again move along the hallway
we pass the scottish wall of fame scottie from star trek sir walter scott sir harry lauder sheena easton al pacino billy connolly then the camera backtracks to pacino where
it holds momentarily
mom dad were here
may comes up wearing a fancy country and western outfit
ah charlie is this the wee harriet
ah shes beautiful

i hope you keep her
calling stuart come out here
when he comes up stuart is wearing only a shirt with his boxer shorts
ah its the wee harriet
stuart put your pants on

calling to william heed
william comes around the corner with his pants
dad whats al pacino doing on the scottish wall of fame
oh thats for tony
so charlie tells me youre a butcher
lets talk meat
dad no one wants to talk shop
especially butcher shop
stuart gets him in a half nelson
dad dad i have a back zit man it kills
charlie struggles to free himself
stuart turns to greet harriet
as he reaches out his hand
totally instinctively harriet grabs stuarts hand and twists it behind his back
charlie is startled as his date has just gotten stuart into a half nelson
releasing his hand im sorry
you just surprised me
i like this one charlie
shes quite a filly
im really embarrassed
dont be embarrassed about having a good strong butchers grip
do you link your own sausage
oh ignore him
come have a look at some photos of charlie when he was a ween
oh mom dont start with the pictures
ah charlie lighten up
youve got a pickle up your ass
whispering to harriet im gonna use the bathroom
you be okay alone with them
dont worry about it
they smile as he leaves the room
make sure theres paper charlie
charlie picks up the pace scared of what he might hear next
make sure you leave the seat down
shutting her up ma just show her the pictures
and light a match
to harriet he always leaves the seat up
hes gotta learn
he closes the door and shakes his head
what can he do
those are his parents
on the wall opposite the toilet is a well used dart board with pictures of the queen mother and colonel sanders
hooked to the magazine caddie is a small container of darts
may excitedly shows harriet family photo albums
this is charlie with his uncle ecky
hes a policeman in canada
and our cousins ruth and jack
hes just got a restraining order from his wife
shes a lovely girl
this is billy
hes a member of parliament
what a nice family you have
he doesnt seem in any hurry to leave either
he listens through the door to harriet enthusiastically looking through old photos
charlie glances down at a stack of national enquirers on the magazine rack
he flips through a few
he sees one of the absurd headlines alien ufo sex diet charlie shakes his head
through door charlie was the cutest baby
through door you okay in there charlie
you didnt fall in did you
through door jesus
charlie then looks down at another article in the enquirer and reads it is the article about mrs
x the axe murderer who kills her husbands on their honeymoons and then marries again under a different identity
may is quickly flipping through a photo album pointing out pictures of relatives as she goes i cant believe the resemblance between you and charlie mrs
with harriet speaking in the b
charlie continues reading now absorbed in the article about the victims through door you have the same smile
its so incredible
sitting in the front seat of charlies car smiling content a great meal a great night out with charlie and a nice evening with his parents
slowly pan across the front seat to charlie
a nervous anxious what the hell am i getting myself into look on his face
so that was some move you put on my dad there
did you study karate or
i dated a guy for a while who ran a studio
oh the martial arts expert
the north south guy
here in san francisco
he looks straight ahead trying to act unfazed
but hes very phased his expression is covered in it
was that before atlantic city or after
oh that was years ago
atlantic city was recent
i didnt care for atlantic city
a town full of gamblers and lounge singers
he keeps driving
charlie walks through the precinct towards tonys office holding the national enquirer in his hand
is tony back there
the sergeant nods and charlie heads back to the office
do you have the k form completed yet that street vendor incident on powell street
really bummed yes captain
tony do you mind my saying that you seem a little down
its about my work
about being a policeman
tony if theres anything wrong im here to listen
and thats whats irritating youre too nice
yes youre my captain for gods sakes
you should be constantly on my case like the captain on starsky and hutch
once a week you should routinely haul my ass into your office accuse me of being a maverick and complain to me that youre sick and tired of defending my
screwball antics to the commissioner
well as you may know tony
i dont report to a commissioner
i report to a committee some of whom are appointed some elected and the remainder co opted on a bi annual basis
a quorum police work should be all about running around following up crazy hunches that turn out to be right going out on a limb
well tony ive never seen it that way
for me police work is all about following procedure and remaining accountable to the general public
when i joined the police force i thought i was going to be serpico and unfortunately i ended up being toma
i would have settled for beretta
thats interesting tony
im perturbed that you should be so disillusioned
hey tony i gotta talk to you
oh hello charlie
look im in the way here
you guys probably have something you want to talk about and tony if youve still got stuff you want to sort out please you know where the suggestion box is
the captain exits
hey whats up
im having doubts about being a cop again
its not like how it is on cop shows
all i do is fill out papers and reports
let me get this straight your captain hasnt threatened to have you up on charges so fast you wont know what hit you
hes never once said to me that he was going to throw the book at me so hard itll knock my ass from here till tuesday
anyways whats up
charlie pulls out the national enquirer the one on mrs
x the honeymoon killer
have you heard of this case
she murders her husbands on their honeymoons and then changes her identity and marries again
i never heard of it
curious thats all
i read about it and
after a pause i think im dating mrs
after a pause two words charlie
they have doctors that deal specifically with this illness
everythings adding up tony
one of the victims was a martial arts expert
last night at dinner she put a martial arts move on my dad
there about twenty thousand people in san francisco who are martial arts experts
should i arrest all of them too
if they also say ralph in their sleep i think itd be a good start
showing him paper ralph elliot
a plumber from san francisco
missing since his honeymoon
youre just getting scared
like the dream you feel harriet could be the one so you start to suspect her of things cause deep down youre scared that if she is the one youll
marry and marriage to you is death
hey dont analyze my dreams okay
theyre my dreams
analyze your own dreams
a beat its not a marrying thing tony
its a murdering thing
showing him paper harriet lived in atlantic city right
well so did this guy right around the same time she left town
reading article larry leonard a crooner who made a name for himself for being able to sing in six different languages the song only you
putting paper down does she know the song only you
i dont know
it hasnt come up yet
charlie move past it
youre running your life by the national enquirer
its the fifth highest circulating newspaper in the united states
taking paper back mrs
look it up
charlie and tony are in the back with kathy a stocky black woman in uniform who works in the files department
theres no record of any deaths
all three of these guys were reported missing around the time of their honeymoon but so were the wives
no pictures of any of the brides
for all we know they just picked up and moved away
and ralph elliot too
charlie youre talking about three guys over a seven year span
thats hardly news
elopement in this state as of this day is still not illegal
re the article yeah well murder is
and this article says that these men were murdered by the same woman
mackenzie weve found that most national enquirer articles are actually based on our own police reports
they take the facts and fabricate a story around them
its true charlie
you gotta realize that
i mean personally i would lie to you but kathy
has this crazy notion of always telling the truth
patting his back you feel better now
it guess so
if i had a photo of harriet i could show it to the relatives or friends of mrs
xs victims to identify her
charlie listen to me
there is no mrs
charlie knocks on the door
thrilled youre back
but harriets not here yet
maybe i could wait
that would be fine
she then starts to slowly close the door
he props it open with his hand
i was hoping
letting him in im glad you asked
i didnt want to be so forward
i mean if youre waiting inside then you feel obligated to entertain me and keep up the conversation just to be polite and really your head might be totally elsewhere
and then theres the chance that you would really want to talk and its me whod be busy but in an attempt not to be rude i sit there and listen to some story that you dont really want to tell and i dont really have time to hear
i couldnt agree with you more
i think about a lot of things
look if you have work to do you go right ahead
ah heres an angle i mean to tell you the truth id love to see your work
what would you like me to do
no i dont want to see you work
i was talking about your work
that one that i saw was so wonderful and
harriets far more talented than i am
well im sure its so subjective anyway and
out of patience rose show me your photos
there are two kinds
beautiful travel pictures and very erotic black and white portraits of young men and women
all with a slight sadomasochistic quality
at the bottom of every photo is says seasons greetings
hey these are some interesting photos here
nice shots of sauselito and
some good bondage shots
a lot of people wouldnt think to mix the two subjects but theyre really a natural together
new thought hey you wouldnt happen to have any pictures of harriet by chance would you
re her cards well i dont think shed wanna do this sort of
no no not that
just in general some photos
any little snapshot would do
i doubt id have any
harriet hates being photographed
the sound of a key in the door as harriet enters the apartment
rose did i see charlies car out in front
were in here harriet
walking in what are you guys doing
covering up oh nothing
just looking through some of roses work
charlie wanted a photo of you
why of me charlie
well sentimental reasons
something to remind me of you when were not together
she takes him in her arms and gives him a knee buckling kiss
there can you remember that
okay its just i was gonna give one to my parents too and
getting nowhere another time would be fine
its hardly a matter of life and death
in the news tonight regarding a beverly hills jeweler morris cohan who died last week police are now suspecting that morriss partner lawrence sachs may have murdered him with an
reveal we are in
charlie is on a stair master as harriet walks in wearing a robe
the tv is on in the b
where you been
i have a surprise for you
i just wanna do a quick twenty minutes on the stair master before bed
harriet drops her robe and from over her shoulder we see that charlie prefers what he sees to working out
ill do forty tomorrow
getting into bed i got something much healthier for you than that
she pulls out a milkshake from behind her back
what is it
its a health shake
eggs malt cinnamon oranges
i mixed it up downstairs
continues on about poisons and poisoners
charlie glances at it
poisoning has become the second leading method of murder in recent years due to
charlie watches the tv looking a bit disturbed
harriet offers him the shake
oh look im full
youll like it charlie
no really thanks
putting it up to his lips you wont try it
i spent twenty minutes making it
he takes it
lifts it to his mouth
then puts it on the table
sniffing it ummm
maybe ill take some to the office tomorrow
running into bathroom im gonna brush my teeth
be right back
charlie goes into the bathroom
harriet comes into the bathroom and lays the empty glass down on the counter
im gonna take a quick shower
charlie notices the empty glass on the counter
harriet where did the shake go
what do you care
i drank it
getting into shower you could have at least tried it
you make me feel bad sometimes charlie
i dont know why
with her in the shower he sneaks back into the bedroom and checks the trash can
then he runs around the bed to the other trash can
he looks thoroughly confused as she enter the bedroom wearing a towel
she takes the towel off as she slips underneath the covers
he gets into bed next to her
she gives him a kiss
im a little sensitive
you didnt want to drink my milkshake
so what right
regarding the murder between the two partners we talked to toxicologist dr
show on the issue
charlie and harriet are watching the news show
doctor show is patched in via the anchormans close circuit tv
doctor is it possible that one could be poisoned with no trace at all
there are plants that grow very commonly in our own backyard that could easily be fermented into poison
take for instance the
getting nervous blocking out tv harriet why dont we shut the light off
and how easy it that to do
scarily enough quite simple
you merely take the
blocking out the tv again maybe we should turn the light back on
yeah thats better
charlie whats the matter
well its just
re the tv the tv
you cant even watch the news these days without getting depressed
i know charlie
and its not just that
look at the things people are doing
partners killing each other
i mean you hear a story like that and
who can you really trust these days
what do you mean
its like have you ever stood with someone at the edge of a cliff or the edge of a subway platform and you think just for a split second what
if i pushed him
well i dont really take the subway ever so
charlie turns over on his side she cuddles up behind him
im just making a point of how many times we trust people with our lives
i mean look at us
if you didnt trust me you would never be able to fall asleep
why do you say that
look at you youre sleeping
look how vulnerable you are
i mean i could do anything at that point
nervous what could you do
sweet and innocent anything
youre lying on your side asleep i could
stick a needle in your ear
grabbing his ear at the thought aahhh
im just making a point of what a good relationship we have
he looks very uneasy
she kisses him and shuts off the light
the moon gives the room an eerie glow
well good night
she doesnt close her eyes
hes scared to close his
smiling good night
they both look over at each other
she closes her eyes
he takes a deep breath and then closes his eyes
and covers his ear with his hand
charlie is on the crowded platform
next to him is an old lady with a lot of shopping bags
three kids on skateboards whiz by and accidentally knock bags out of her hands
cat toys and cans of cat food go everywhere
charlie bends down and starts to help her gather her stuff
thank you very much young man
ive gotta get all this stuff back to my children
when i say my children i mean my cats
you see my children moved out years ago so all ive got is my cats
i have over one hundred of them
thats a lot of cats
charlie looks up and sees harriet waving to him from the subway stairs
he waves back and motions
ill be there in a second and continues to help the old lady
she watches from the stairs
you see this red toy
thats for the captain hes finicky
and this blue one
thats for marco polo
two train headlights are seen off in the distance
do you have a name for all of your cats
charlie glances over at harriet who slowly makes her way down the platform towards him
let me see
theres winston churchill reda sovine thomas edison andrew carnegie
the train is getting closer and closer and so is harriet
he was scottish
harriet moves forward a step charlie moves back a step
wasnt he irish
as harriet seems to get closer charlie continues to back up picking up cat toys
charlie realizes he has no where else to turn
so he side steps down the platform never stopping his conversation with the lady
actually he was scottish
trust me i know these things
harriet is moving in on him
charlie steadily makes his way down the platform feigning accidentally kicking cat food down the platform
the old lady is unsure what is going on she tries to keep up with him
now that you say it he was scotch
charlie runs out of platform
harriet is very close to him
the train is closer so is harriet
charlie lets out a scream
charlie is standing at the edge of the platform harriet is a good six or seven feet away as the train passes by
charlie is safe
people are all staring at charlie curiously including harriet and the old lady
charlie is embarrassed
embarrassed nooooooo scotch is a drink
scots are a people
sorry that just always bugged me
no one knows what is going on
im sorry i didnt know it meant so much to you
we find charlie at the marriage counter
yes sir can i help you
id like to put in an announcement of my parents forty fifth wedding anniversary
per word and youve got a choice of standard or bold
bold and here ive written it out
charlie looks over to the deaths counter
he overhears two obituary assistants having a conversation
hi frank busy week
ive only got two
its dead around here
both assistants laugh
charlie is mildly bemused
well ive got this one guy a tourist
he had a heart attack on a cable car
looks like he left his heart in san francisco
hey thats a real person youre talking about
youre right im sorry
well theres this other guy elliot ralph
plumber disappeared four months ago
body found in a sewer
pause despite himself i guess he took his work too seriously and his life went down the drain
did they mention anything about his wife
crest fallen youre right i feel bad
im mean these are real people were talking about
no im serious
did he mention the wife
you made your point
i was wrong to make a joke about a persons life
i really want to know about his wife
crying and shouting o
im a bad bad person
frank take it easy
no hes right
pounding his head with his fists im for shit im one insensitive asshole
is there any mention of the wife
charlie stands outside the announcement office terrified
harriet is talking to a customer
beat i think youre a terrific woman
beat i just dont think we should see each other anymore
she moves around to charlie
she lifts his chin so that he is looking directly into her eyes
and tell me the truth
the truth is
she is so close to him and so very beautiful its distracting
the truth is
im afraid that you are
he cant youre going to laugh
i dont think so
the truth is that im afraid youre going to ki
im going to cleave you
what does that mean
not cleave me
and so i decided to take matters into my own hands and get it over with by
he feels awful purely preventive
its not anything youve done
i know that
so why are you leaving me
heartbroken harriet maybe im not meant to be in a relationship
a single tear runs down her cheek
she brushes it away quickly
i never wanted to hurt you
at least you left early on
shes crying so thats it then
ive got a lot of work to do
to customer now where were we
charlie lies on the bar head down
tony rushes in looks around and sees charlie
without lifting head two hours and four minutes
tony i need you and two hours and four minutes later you show up
i know it was irresponsible to stay at the drug bust until it was over but
slowly sitting up im gonna tell you but when i do just say nothing
dont judge me
just be my friend
i broke up with harriet
youre an asshole
whats your point
im sorry i just
tony shes a killer
but nothings proven
the only thing youre actually sure she did so far is shes treated you like a king
i dunno tony i just
besides everyone has something going on with them
i mean you cant find everything in one person
i mean shes bright shes funny shes independent
so maybe and its really just a maybe she kills her husbands
marriage is give and take man
you take the good with the bad
charlie lies in bed
hes writing in his journal
he stares out into space
inspired he writes
pauses a moment to reflect then writes
thinks of something else and writes
his hand reaches across and scratches it out
charlie is exiting a vintage record store
suddenly he finds himself face to face with sherri
shes accompanied by a handsome young man
howre you doing
he glances at her friend good huh
this is michael
michael this is charlie mackenzie
why dont you two talk
im going over there to buy some magazines
he walks over to a magazine stand
that good looking and he can read
im teaching him
i heard you have a new girlfriend
we broke up
there were problems
let me guess
smiles shes a murderer
for a moment charlie is too stunned to respond
why did you just say that
laughs what else is left
hes on the stair master stepping very lethargically
the telephone rings he goes to answer
through phone not that it matters anymore but i thought you should know someone just turned themselves in for the murder of ralph elliot
did she confess to the other murders
just the plumber so far but shell come along
after a pause a little old lady from pacific heights
said he overcharged her on a leaking sink
leaky sink huh
anyway crime to stop
ill catch you later
tony hangs up
charlie stops pedaling on the bike
now he really feels like shit
harriets not a killer
sherris not a cheater
he races out of the bedroom
moments later he appears puts on a pair of pants over his exercise shorts then races out the door again
charlie races along towards harriets house
he races up to the door and starts to bang and knock and ring
through door harriet its me charlie
go away charlie
ive gotta talk to you cause i miss you and i made a mistake
and if you give me another chance ill change
ill get help or therapy or
yeah thatll be great
even twice a week
ill check with my insurance to see if im covered but forget that
the chain opens on the door
you really hurt me
ill make it up to you can we at least talk
rose steps up behind charlie
as she now proceeds to be let in by harriet trust your first instincts charlie
you never do
its your big mistake
that and the haircut
once again baffled by rose charlie touches his hair shakes it off and looks harriet right in the eye
i dont want to lose you
you didnt lose me
you rejected me
im unrejecting you
how do i know you wont reject me again
i love you
after a long pause i love you
but you blew it charlie you blew it
she goes into the house
charlie stands there dejected
he knows hes blown it
harriet is doing a load of laundry consisting of bloodied work clothes
suddenly she can hear the sound of music very loudly
annoyed she goes out her front door to tell her neighbors off
just as shes about to knock on the door she realizes its not the source of the music
at that moment her neighbor who is a stewardess comes out in nightclothes
i dont mean to be a pain but im a stewardess and i have an early flight out in the morning
can you please keep your music down
i thought it was coming from here
but someone keeps shouting your name over and over
puzzled harriet rushes back to her own balcony
harriet rushes out and smiles as she sees the source of the noise
charlie serenades harriet in the street below accompanied by a trumpeter with a mute a double bass player a crowd has gathered in the street and spectators group on their
they break out into applause
charlie proudly takes the applause and bows to harriet
she throws him a flower
hes won her back
romantic with candles surrounding the tub
harriet and charlie are bathing together
wherever one of them moves the water extinguishes a candle and charlie lights it
this is keeping him pretty busy
ive been there for almost a year
i only planned on stay with her for a few weeks but she gets upset every time i say im moving
you were close as kids
i pretty much raised her
you know the scene
she remembers my dad was a photographer too
he hated it
trudging off to those weddings every saturday night
other peoples celebrations he called it
he said sometimes they didnt even offer him a glass of soda
he had a small studio and every year at christmas hed take a picture of me and rose and put it in the window on a little card that said
i could see his pain in my face
anyway me and my sister worked with our childhood issues in different ways
she became a photographer and i became phobic about having my picture taken
its quite a family
where are they now
there is a ring at the door
harriet its for you
charlie comes out of the bathroom in a robe
charlie i want you to meet a friend of mine
say hi to ralph
a plain looking lady in her thirties ralph is sitting by the window
delighted oh like ralph the lady carpenter in green acres
this is charlie
i love you
its nice to meet you
its more than nice
its great to meet you
its fantastic to meet you
i just i cant tell you how glad i am
well thank you ive heard a lot of nice things about you too and
he rushes over to hug her
oh ralphie i love you
swept up in his enthusiasm his towel falls off
harriet is shocked but amused
ill leave you guys alone

charlie realizes he is naked
his arms are still wrapped around ralph
im naked arent i
why yes you are
i should really get dressed now
he hurriedly puts his towel back on bolts to the bedroom door
just before he enters he pauses and turns to ralph
to ralph call me
to harriet a little confused friendly guy
and charlies mother may shoulders her way through the door carrying a happy anniversary cake with a big written on it
may and stuarts year anniversary party
uncle angus is at the piano playing happy anniversary as charlies parents all their friends and harriet all sit around the piano happy anniversary to you
the song ends
may and stuart blow out the candles
okay everyone come and get a piece of cake and some milk

stuart looks up and charlie gets him in a headlock and pins him to the ground

uncle angus breaks into stand by your man

charlie looks at another young couple who are touched by this sincere display of love
he looks over at harriet

charlie approaches harriet

im finally ready to trust you and to make a commitment

harriet flinches slightly at the word wife but charlie is too wrapped up in the moment to notice
stuart addresses the group
id like to thank charlie for throwing us this party
i hope some day you have the same great years that weve had
people clap and smile
harriet looks at charlie
he has tears in his eyes
at first it doesnt register
lets get married charlie
from across room harriet come here a minute
i want you and uncle angus to play a song together
harriet and charlie kiss one last time and she goes to the piano
charlie stays in the corner and tony comes over
hey sorry im so late
nothing at all
just two little things
as tony looks in that woman over there in the corner
shes harriets friend and her name is ralph
that woman over there
re harriet thats harriet and were getting married
what did i tell you
shes a great girl
and the last thing in the world shed be is a murderer
and then harriet begins singing at the piano
singing tony and charlie look at each other
then charlie looks at his bride with confidence
he walks over and joins her
she sings to him
its a moment
charlie and harriet pick out a diamond ring
charlie and harriet point to brochures of the different cities they could go to on their honeymoon
they decide on a picture of the dry creek lodge in oregon
they are getting their blood tests back
harriet looks at hers casually
charlie is nervous
reluctantly he opens the file and looks at it
he is pleased with the results and does a victory dance
charlie and harriet are being married
harriet is in a beautiful wedding gown
charlie is wearing a kilt
tony is the best man
he also wears a kilt
stuart also kilted may the whole family along with a hundred well wishers are in attendance
the scottish minister presides
rose is in a kilt
mackenzie if you will take this woman to be your wife through thick and thin for better or for worse please say i do
now harriet if you will take this man through good times and bad for ever and ever as your husband please say i do
harriet starts to speak but right before the words come out she stares into charlies eyes and stops
charlie looks nervous
so does the scottish minister
so does tony
so does everyone
after a long pause finally i do
kiss the beautiful bride
charlie and harriet kiss
we can see though charlie cant harriet has a strange unsure expression on her face
tony notices it though and cant figure it out
lets get pissed
the wedding march kicks in being played by a drunken scotsman on bagpipes
a scottish accordionist and a drummer play scotland the brave
some older scottish aunties are clapping and hooting loudly along with the tune
some young girl cousins in traditional scottish costume dance the sword dance along to scotland we pass the buffet which we see is catered by meats of the world
then we pass a very drunken stuart in a heated discussion with four other people
you know golden gate park was designed by a scotsman macclaren which is who macclaren park was named after
the others agree heartily
may and tony are dancing
may is dancing uncomfortably close
she keeps sliding her hand down to his ass which he then has to move back to his shoulder
then we come to william whos reluctantly at the childrens table
all his little cousins are queuing up for a chance to feel his head
we find charlie in a corner
one of the hooting scottish aunties is trying to get him to have another scotch
proffering the scotch charlie get this down your neck
auntie molly if i have another one ill end up underneath the table with my kilt over my head
tony joins them
i dont know
oh there she is
shes in the corner by herself looking weird and ominous
she has enough food in front or her for three people
she eats ravenously and incessantly
charlie goes over to her
a little hungry were you
at that moment a flash goes off
harriet looks up angrily
what are you
then she realizes its rose
she calms down and smiles
charlie looks at her a little peculiarly but harriet regains her composure
the flash just
the band kicks into a new dance
a young boy comes up to the bagpipe man with a shot of whiskey and whispers into his ear
the bagpipe man stops the song downs the whiskey and then breaks into rod stewarts if you think im sexy
from across the room we hear stuart singing
full volume singing stuart gives the bagpiper the thumbs up
the young people in the room start to jam and then one by one the other guests start getting into the swing of things
the bagpipe man continues playing
it is clear that he is far too drunk to play
he slowly keels over drunk
and as he falls over face first he lands on his bagpipes
the bagpipes let out an atonal deflating sound like the last dying throes of a tortured animal
the bagpipe wail extends into the next scene
wait til you see this place harriet
they drive along the beautiful coast
harriet is still eating
theyre listening to teenage fan club
this is teenage fan club
theyre from scotland
well have the whole lodge to ourselves practically

tony is at his desk

tony exits for a beat then pokes his head in the doorway
thats much better captain
nice again you think so
well thank you very much
tony hurries to his car
they stop at a gas station with a small mini mart
as charlie is filling the tank he notices harriet slipping the key out of the ignition before she walks to the mini mart for more food
you want anything
lamb chops creamed spinach stuffed tomatoes and a hershey bar
harriet arrives at the little ma and pa type mini mart and smiles to charlie
if they dont have all that ill just take the hershey bar
tony stands at the door buzzing the buzzer to no response
they are still driving along the coast
charlie is eating his hershey bar
harriets eyes are becoming a bit glazed now her movements a little static
she keeps looking behind them and out the window
what do you keep looking behind us for
joking is someone following you or
i think theyre gone
curious pausing what do you mean they were
the gas station guy
i thought he was chasing us for a while but i guess he stopped
the gas station guy
why would the gas station guy chase us
i dont know charlie
i guess for not paying
what do you mean not paying
you didnt pay him for the gas
i forgot to pay
i didnt want to be away from you for any longer
so you just left
and youre an accomplice
he stops mid bite on his hershey bar
im not sure i understand
look charlie dont you get it
were a team
going with it i can play that game
ill get the next gas station
like bonnie clyde
he and bonnie continue on the winding road and pass a sign that reads dry creek lodge miles tony knocks
he picks the lock and enters
rose is tied up and lying in a pool of blood
tony stops for a beat draws his gun and slowly walks over to her
just as he gets there a shutter clicks
practically hysterical what is it with the women in your family
i was just doing a murder series in honor of the wedding
hey this is real blood
yes harriet give it to me
shes a butcher
tony reacts she owns a butcher shop
i need a picture of harriet
no can do
you took a picture at the party
i saw it
it didnt come out
i need a photo
the picture didnt come out
he waits it was unflattering
in made her look ten pounds heavier
he waits shes my sister
shes been implicated in a crime
i need the photo to eliminate her as a suspect
and if shes not innocent
if shes you know quirky
if shes quirky well save charlies life
rose pulls out a photograph charlie and harriet
looking young and in love
a beautiful old colonial mansion nestled in the mountains and forests of the north west
romantic and from another day
charlie and harriet pull up in front of it
the valets open the door for them
its like a castle charlie
its so beautiful
welcome to the dry creek
you just beat the rainstorm
two hours later and the roadsd probably be closed
if you could help us with the luggage we have these two in the back seat and
as they deal with the luggage harriet starts to walk away from the hotel away from the car rain falling on her head
she walks straight at the camera so only we can see her expression
her expression is one of simply losing it
what are you doing honey
harriet turns around and smiles at charlie
he smiles back
charlie and harriet stand at the desk
harriet is not quite paying attention
her attention span has slipped to none
she looks around suspiciously at everything and everyone
we have you with us for four nights mr
dinner reservations are at eight thirty
also you might wanna prepare some candles by the bed
were expecting the rainstorm to get even worse
we might even lose the power tonight
did you hear that harriet
i cant think of anything more romantic than the two of us trapped in our room in the middle of a rain storm
noticing her you okay harriet
just a little head ache
to clerk excuse me is there a drug store in the hotel
i want to get some aspirin
right beyond those trees mam
anything you need
dont go anywhere
ill be right back
harriet walks off to the lobby store backwards looking at charlie
charlie watches her walk off
the desk clerk sits staring at charlie
you think shes really got a head ache
heres your key
youre in the oak room
charlie looks back at the drug store where harriet is shopping
she waves to him
charlie looks back at the desk clerk and grabs the key
coming out of a fax machine
walter the owner of the plumbing store dressed in overalls takes the fax out and then picks up the phone
thats ralph elliots wife alright
she had shorter hair in those days
master cho the new owner of the studio dressed in a gee looks at the same fax
into phone mrs
richter gain much weight since then but its definitely her
randy romano the owner talks into the phone holding up the faxed photo of charlie and harriet
thats his little lollipop alright
boy he loved her
ill tell you she was a lot of fun
a doll face to boot
tony is on the phone
kathy seen before at the police station stands with him
circuits are out from the storm
tony gets to the police station door and opens it
kathy follows him
to kathy keep trying the hotel

the police captain enters
points to his hair see that spiletti a gray hair
every day spiletti i find another one
and thats all due to you
get out there and catch me some bad guys
not now captain
nice again sorry
tony dashes out of the police station and into his car
a beautiful suite with a fireplace burning a big stack of wood with another stack next to it with an axe in it
music is playing softly on the stereo
and charlie and harriet have just finished making love underneath the covers illuminated just by the light of the fireplace
this is the best honeymoon i could ever imagine harriet
if we had to pack and go home right now id still think it was the greatest honeymoon ever
harriet doesnt respond
her head is turned from his
dont you agree harriet
he pulls the sheets away from her face to see that she is crying
wiping her tears what
what are you crying
what is it
i was just thinking
were married now
and i always wanted to try and have kids and
so do i
look theres nothing more id like to do than have kids or
its just i get scared that certain things will happen or
what are you talking about
youre gonna be a great mom
i know you will
its not that charlie
youre gonna laugh
of course im not gonna laugh
kids is a big thing
im sure i have the same fears
if we have kids charlie things happen
kids are healthy and fine and some arent and i dont know if i could live with myself if i gave birth to a child with webbed feet
charlie stops to think about this
no im not laughing
you think thats silly
thats a natural fear
ive thought about that fear
it really worries me charlie
quite confused well look they have doctors i assume that deal only with webbed feet
and god forbid and im talking strictly hypothetically should that happen well find one
kissing him happy now youre the greatest charlie
confused to say the least thanks
we should get ready for dinner
a small plane flies through the clouds
its just tony and dennis the pilot
dennis never really realizes this is more than a sightseeing tour and constantly points out scenic points along the way
out your left side you can see the sierra nevada which is the largest mountain range west of the rockies
i dont care
charlie is dressed very sharply in sport coat and tie
he yells into the bathroom where we can see part of harriet from behind
you almost ready
the first seating is in five minutes
from other room i just wanna look good for you charlie
im sure you look great
im sure you look
harriet turns the corner wearing a nice dress
her hair looks okay
shes wearing perfume
the only problem is she has two lines of mascara running down her cheeks
shes been crying
charlie looks curious
do i look okay charlie
charlie points to his own eye
you kind of look like tammy faye baker right now
she looks in the mirror
she goes back into the bathroom
the plane descends towards the runway
the rain comes down hard
as we prepare to land we can see off to our left lake shanony which is
dont worry about lake shanony
i dont give a shit about lake shanony
the plane touches down
rain pours fantastically on the gothic castle
wind blows hard
a toast to our new friends charlie and harriet
a beautiful dining room with a small dance floor
charlie sits at an intimate table for two with harriet
a small band plays in the b
as the band leader is making the toast
the five or six other couples in the restaurant also hold up their glass
were honored to be here for this very special day in
the concierge at this point interrupts to bring charlie a telephone
everyone stops and watches and waits
im sorry to interrupt sir
theres a phone call for you from town
charlie takes phone they say its quite urgent
the toast as well as the entire room stops almost like an e
hutton commercial waiting for charlies phone call to finish
tony speaks into the phone frantically
charlie you okay
couldnt be better
charlie listen to me
harriet is mrs
she killed ralph and the two other men
charlie looks up across the table at harriet who is completely caught up in the event of seeing how long she can keep her hand in the candle before it
she puts it in smiles then takes it out
she shakes her hand and repeats the process
talking softly look thats great it just so happens though that i met
louder than he had hoped ralph and much to my delight not only is she alive but shes female
i thought i told you
harriet looks at charlie very suspiciously
he looks back at her and tries to smile pretending that he is having a pleasant and completely irrelevant conversation
rose had a picture
it checked out
its her charlie
she is the murderer
charlie your food is getting cold
charlie waves one minute to harriet as she watches
so what do i do
i called the police
all the roads are closed but theyre on their way
in the mean time just
the line goes dead
pressing receiver hello
whats a matter charlie
to concierge the phone just went dead
i was on the phone and it went dead
thats quite common sir
im sure the linesll be out in the whole city til tomorrow
enjoy your meal sir
the concierge takes the phone away
charlie turns slowly to harriet genuinely scared
what happened charlie
just the lines are down
suddenly the band leader continues with his toast
over microphone so to these two young people we wish them a long and happy life together and would like to play their song
the platters only you
the band starts to play only you
harriet and charlie just stare at each other
the older couple at the next table mr
levenstein lean over to their table
how about the traditional bride groom dance
another couple walks by and pulls them literally out of the their seats and onto the dance floor
its a tradition
charlie finds himself in the middle of the dance floor dancing slowly with harriet
hes scared out of his mind
the music plays in the background
harriet smiles strangely at him
he tries to smile back checking all the exits planning an escape
then suddenly call it luckily mr
levenstein interrupts excuse me
could i cut in on your dance
charlie gives her hand away to mr
he takes mrs
levensteins hand and starts to dance towards the exit when suddenly the electricity goes out
the music is out
the in the dimmest of lights provided from the cloud covered moon outside charlie runs across the dance floor fighting for an exit to the outside
he arrives in someones arms on his way
i need your help
you have to help me
ive married a
the lights go back on and charlie is in harriets arms again
her face is near menacing now
she smiles a very disturbed grin
he doesnt know what to say
much too pleasant hello charlie
charlie and her are squared off
suddenly both of them are lifted into the air
they look down and see the waiters and busboys picking them up onto chairs throwing them up in the air again and again
the music plays along loudly
harriet watches charlie very closely as charlie looks scared
then the people start to carry them out of the room and down the hallway
lets take em to their room
yeah im sure theyve had enough of these crowds for one night
i didnt finish my dinner yet
act like youre having a good time
tony is talking to an attractive young girl behind the airport rent a car booth
im sorry sir
the roads are all closed
we cant rent any cars this evening
you have to rent me something
ive gotta get up there
my friends in danger
the other hotel guests threw them inside
the room is all made up the sheets are pulled down the firewood is cut the axe is in the wood
have a good night you two
come on in
stay for a nightcap
no you two wanna be alone
demanding stay for a nightcap
sir i really dont think i should shouting the bellboy is frightened and runs away
shouting down the hall after him harriet pulls charlie back into the room frightened that hes leaving
dont go charlie
tony runs out of the airport terminal where he sees a man in his forties whos just entered his four wheel drive jeep
flashing his badge excuse me sir im with the san francisco police department
im on official business and im afraid i have to commandeer your vehicle
what do you mean no
i happen to know for a fact that you dont have the power to commandeer my vehicle
this is true
pause please can i commandeer your vehicle
well where are you going

ill give you a lift
well i dont want a lift i really want to commandeer the vehicle
please just let me commandeer the vehicle

really i dont mind its on my way
pause youre not going to bend on the commandeering thing are you
well if we get stopped will you at least let me say that i commandeered the vehicle but i let you drive
im uncomfortable with that
charlie harriet are all alone
the voices trail off down the hallway until they disappear
charlie and harriet stare at each other
harriet blocks the door
charlie looks around the room
the letter opener
the fountain pen
at this point everything in the room looks like a potential weapon
harriet takes the axe
i heard you on the phone before charlie
theres something ive got to tell you
frightened harriet i
ive been married before
i already know
about my husbands
and i was meaning to have a word with you
we could get an annulment
suddenly the power goes off again
theyre both in the dark
charlie has restrained harriet throws her in a walk in closet and locks it
from behind the door we hear harriet wailing
charlie picks up the axe looks at it relieved at his lucky escape
he rushes to the door to escape
he opens it and standing there is rose
aaaaah rose i never thought id be so glad to see you
charlie puts down the axe
the lights flicker back on
going to the phone maybe the phones are working again by now
he listens for a dial tone
beside the phone he sees a note
he starts to read is dear harriet
i just cant handle the commitment
im leaving you
and behind him rose approaches with the axe raised
what the hell is this
i didnt write this
and at that moment he turns to find the axe being flung through the air at his head
he ducks just in time
what the fuck
she takes another swing and she hits the lamp off the desk and the room is in complete darkness
why did you marry harriet
i warned you not to marry her didnt i
i warned all of them
but none of them listened to me
they all went ahead and married her
shes the pretty one
what have you done with my sister harriet
if youve done something to my sister harriet i swear to god ill kill you
we stay in charlies hip pocket as he tries to get away from what he cant see
he stays very silent
from the closet where are you charlie
whats going on
then rose strikes a match
she lights a candle and comes toward him
he looks around
the window is open
and charlie is gone
tony and the commandeered man drive through the swampy winding road on the way up to the hotel
tony is drumming on the dash
could you stop doing that please
charlie tightropes along the ledge of the building
the storm continues
rose comes out on the ledge and starts to chase him
he rounds the bend
charlie looks into one room and sees mr
theres loud opera music playing in the room call the police
the levensteins prepare for bed
charlie races by their window
then rose races by
call the police
levenstein closes the curtains
he cant hear
charlie races along the slippery ledge almost falling at several points
rose then appears on the roof holding the axe still
mostly to herself slurring most words charlie did you like your note
i thought it was pretty accurate
i did all the husbands notes
i can forge anyones handwriting i can write in anyones style
see im an artist
harriet isnt an artist
sure she could get a husband but she could never have done this
and you know what im most proud of
whats that rose
harriet never knew
she thought they all just left her
i protected her
shes my sister
charlie turns and runs
rose chases him
tony breaks into the room with his gun drawn
from closet tony is that you
its me harriet
im in here
carefully tony opens the closet door
tony rose is trying to kill charlie
theyre out on the ledge
not believing get on the floor and put your hands behind your back
harriet willingly goes on the floor
youve got to save charlie
tony slaps cuffs on her and takes her to the window
tony is standing with his back to the window between it and harriet
she looks out of the window and screams
from harriets pov we see charlie on the ledge edging along
he stops in horror when he sees harriet glances back to the pursuing rose and rushes off
tony looks behind him out the window
nobody is there
i swear to you
it was charlie
now theres rose
rose looks into the room with the axe in her hand
no you dont
i beg you
it is rose
oh no not again
he glances at the window aaaaah
there is opera music playing
charlie rushes by past the window
there is a beat and he comes back staring inside in amazement
levenstein is in a viking outfit
levenstein is in full norse regalia
charlie gulps and rushes on hastily pursued by rose
rose pulls the axe back and swings and the momentum of the swing pulls her feet out from under her and on the slippery icy roof she falls and starts
just as shes about to go off the fifty foot high roof charlie climbs down the roof
he stands over her
shes about to slip
her hands are losing strength
her fingers are slipping
the rain is falling harder and harder
charlie walks over to the cage where shes hanging on for life
he leans down to help her up but just as he grabs on to her hand the drainpipe shes holding onto slips
she is now dangling from the roof the rain falling harder and harder
charlie now is nowhere near her
he then gets down on his knees on the roof and starts to climb down the side of the drainpipe to get her
rose looks up helplessly at him
not really asking for his help
not denying it
shes accepted her fate
policemen ambulances and spectators have gathered below in bunches as charlie climbs down the drainpipe he himself hanging on for dear life
he just reaches out far enough to grab her hand and just as he does her drainpipe tears and falls into the crowd below
charlie then with all his strength his where has this strength been my whole life strength pulls her up to the roof next to him
several policemen make their way onto the roof and come over to where charlie is detaining rose
the police take her handcuff her and cart her away
from the corner of the roof appears tony
i hate to bother you on your honeymoon charlie but
charlie looks beyond tony and sees harriet standing in the doorway
he goes over and puts his arm around harriet
im sorry i doubted you but i thought you were the killer but you were acting pretty strange
i thought you were going to leave me like the others
thank god they were just murdered
i thought they were always leaving me
below rose is put into a police car and taken off
the sirens disappear
so do the crowds
charlie is on stage looking very beatnik
hes reading his poetry but we cant hear it
he nods to someone off stage
harriet is in the audience also looking very beatnik with their three year old son stuart a miniature beatnik version of charlie
my dad was right
you dont lose your muse once youre married
nothing changed except i gained a great son stuart
sound up on charlies poetry
the crowd goes crazy
thank you very much
house music kicks on
its saturday night by the bay city rollers
charlie comes off stage and joins his wife and child at their table
he is very happy
