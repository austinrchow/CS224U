written by sean anders john morris a dozen or so shadowy people are seated in the darkened room
a slide projector dimly lights mr
fuller a crew cutted robert stack type in a suit as he addresses the group
the current slide is a still from a security video of a blurry figure it could be any of about a billion people
so lets keep a steely eye out for this bastard
then before we dismiss this is your monthly reminder of why were here
fuller advances to a slide of the american flag
close on one of the group a heavyset bald man in his mid thirties
he politely pays close attention to the presentation
the american people want to travel
slide family in front of a fake dinosaur they want to attend baseball contests slide fat guys spilling beers as they go for a foul ball and popular music concerts
slide john tesh close on another face in the group
a doughy man with three day scruff and a trendily long haircut
he looks bored rolling his eyes at the speech
they want to be happy
slide people line dancing but security comes first
slide army soldier with a massive machine gun guards a play ground without security there can be no happy
you are americas front line in the global war on terror
lets hit the trenches and lets be careful out there
slide tsa logo the lights come up and as the group files out we get a better look at their uniforms
the tsa agents move out into the
the agents take their places manning the screening equipment
we push in on the bald man as he takes up his post next to the walk through metal detector
this is kirk kettner
he is not a looker
his uniform only serves to highlight his least attractive features but his eyes and demeanor are pleasant and kind
the scruffy agent is stainer
he stands at the x ray monitor
as the bags begin to move through he does not pay any attention rather he hands kirk a flyer
insert the flyer reads wheel in the sky a tribute to journey at club vertigo every tuesday night
stainer is pictured wearing a massive afro in the band photo
i dont know stainer
dude you never come see us anymore
its been like four months
time to forget about marnie and get back on the whores
stainer does a sex dance that makes everyone uncomfortable
fuller shoots a stern look from his office
its not that
its my grandma
ill probably be at the hospital for the next few nights
i spaced that
hows she doing
shes hanging in there but it doesnt look good
dude im sorry
shes a great lady
a middle eastern man in a cowboy hat is next in line
fuller appears behind kirk taps his shoulder and subtly motions to the arab
kirk smiles at the potential terrorist
hey there habib
perfect english with a southern accent howdy kirk
lemme guess i been flagged for a random search
ill get you out of here quick
you off to boston again
pediatric convention in delaware
kirk opens habibs bag
kirk i know youre just doing your job but for petes sake yall know me
kirk gestures to his boss as he zips the bag back up
okay habib youre all set buddy
have a good trip
see you next time
fuller again appears behind kirk
to fuller now in a thick arab accent praise be to allah
you think thats funny
you wanna sit in first class or you wanna sit on my gloved and jellied finger
follow a pair of perfect female legs as the womans heels click along the sidewalk suitcase rolling behind
although we cant see the woman riding on these legs we can see several men stare as she passes by on her way into
more stares from more men and even a few women as we follow the legs to the check in line
the legs glide to the front and stop to wait for the next available ticket agent
from the slightly upward angle we see two young male ticket agents
one on each side of the legs
one is black and one white each are dealing with customers
they simultaneously notice our woman
they suspiciously eye one another and the race is on
each agent begins typing furiously to expedite their current customer in the hope of waiting on her next
angle on the white agent as he waits on a yuppie couple
okay how many bags are you checking
is this one too big to carry on
carry it on
grant you dont want to lug that thing all over the airport
the agent leans back and issues a bothered sigh
he looks to his right to check the progress of the black agent who is waiting on an old asian woman
did you pack your bags yourself
the asian woman obviously did not understand a word of the question but she smiles and nods along
has anyone unknown to you asked you to carry anything onto your flight
more smiles and blank nods
i think you mean no
you cant do that
she doesnt know what the hell im talking about
where exactly is gate f
just past f
have a day now folks
lets hustle it up
keep it moving
the asian woman is not going anywhere
the black agent leans into her face and barks once like a dog
her smile turns to fear as she backs away ending the race in a dead tie
reverse to show the woman they were competing for
she is a classy sophisticated blonde around thirty
drop dead beautiful
she is startled by the sudden call from both men
she laughs off her little scare and then randomly chooses the black agent
he shoots a smug victory grin over to his co worker who is being an overtly sore loser
hi im booked on flight to burbank
trying way too hard california
so do you travel quite a bit
the white agent moves to loiter around the black agents station just to get a better look at molly
you got the numbers on the making it up as he goes new um procedures for the um airport thing
regarding the ah planes
to molly whassup
kirk is at his post
stainer works the next x ray belt where a young rocker type is running a guitar case through
stainer stops the belt and moves it back to get a better look
les paul classic re issue
no its a sixty five
the rocker boy looks at his watch as stainer rolls the case through and pops it open
dude im late for my flight
sorry i have to search this case for you know explosives and such
this thing is sweet
stainer takes the guitar out and starts riffing on it as the bins and bags pile up before him
at kirks station molly the blonde bombshell is crossing through
every guy who can see her has been struck dumb but kirk banters with her like he would anyone else
no flirting or stammering just friendly and relaxed
oh hello again
second trip in two days
molly is putting her laptop back in her bag
its just a short hop to l
but theyve got me going back and forth three days in a row
this client is killing me
well hang in there kiddo and i guess ill see you tomorrow
its a date
mollys long legs carry her toward the gates as every man except kirk watches
fuller saunters up and nudges kirk
didja see that
boy would i ever like to
put my penis in her vagina
wink back at stainers station
as he puts the guitar back in its case he scratches it on the corner of the x ray machine
stainer and rocker boy lock in shocked gazes
what the hell
he grabs his guitar and inspects a wicked scratch
dude i am so sorry
sorry my ass
this thing is worth more than you make in a year you clumsy motherfucker
yeah i bet it was but
stainer points to a white sign mounted in an acrylic stand
tsa is not responsible for items lost or damaged in the security screening process
stainer flips the sign around to reveal a few more words hand written on the back
he reads them aloud
so fuck you
kirk enters to find his mother an attractive old woman sitting with a short plain woman about kirks age
oh hi sweetie
across the room kirks father is speaking to a man who looks a bit like kirk
the man is telling a funny story that cracks up mr
the two pretend to box for a moment
whos that guy dads with
marnie the plain woman stands and takes kirk aside
kirk youve been really great about your mom and i staying so close since we broke up but i know how much grammy meant to you
well is it okay with you that im here
its not okay good
then can i introduce you to my new boyfriend
she leads kirk over to the man who is speaking with his father
they are laughing again

kettner laugh no
im just jack assin with you pirate
great to meet you

ive been better
im sorry about your grandmother

well old people you know what are you gonna do
kirks brother eric and his fiance debbie enter from the hall
they are both in their late thirties and good looking for trailer trash
debbie is about seven months pregnant
grammy wants to see you
well i better get in there
eric and debbie walk with kirk down the hall
listen im pretty sure she wants to discuss the will
she wont tell us dick so were kind of hoping you can grease the wheels
okay but you know grammy didnt have all that much
once the hospital and
and the ah
yeah yeah the cremation and what not
well its not going to leave enough to get worked up over
weve got a wedding to pay for kirk and
debbie let me handle this
weve got a wedding to pay for numbnuts and you know mom and dad are going to branson next month
now you always been grammys favorite so were counting on you to get in there and sort out whats what
in a dimly lit hospital room a very old woman lies in a bed
she is hooked up to an i
and several monitors
kirk comes in and forces a smile
grammys voice is weak and shaky
there you are big slick
did you bring em
grammy you really shouldnt
just hand em over
im on deaths door and you know it
kirk sits and reluctantly hands her a pack of cigarettes
oh for christs sake
grammy lights up a smoke and savors a long drag
kirk tears up at how slightly his grandmother clings to life
i love you grammy
dont start that shit now
youre looking at one lucky old broad whos done a lot skydiving rollerderby colored fellas
i got no complaints
so when the check comes i dont want any blubbering or bullshit outta you
just enjoy your life like i did mine and raise a glass to your old grammy once in a while
kirk hugs her and he cries a bit
you know how much i love you kirk
molly is coming through kirks lane again
fuller steps in and stops her before she crosses through
maam could you please remove your jacket and shoes
fuller is leering at her stellar body
shes about to go through when he stops her again
why dont we go ahead and strip off that belt too while were at it
molly takes an exasperated breath as she removes her belt
she starts to move through but again fuller stops her with a raised palm
he then motions to her breasts and crotch
any piercings youd like me to know about
why dont you just come on through maam and well see if anything sets off the machine
molly steps through
the machine does not go off
she gathers her things and mouths a silent thank you to kirk as she walks on
fuller glares at kirk but before he can say anything randy a young agent calls out from the office
kirk walks over to take the call
you best hope the terrorists are taking personal calls on the job too mister
kirk takes the phone from randy
this is kirk kettner
kirks expression tells us that some sad news is coming in
kirk sits at a table with a cup of coffee
he opens his wallet and flips to a photo of a much younger grammy and an eight year old kirk in a casino
grammy is smoking a cigarette and dealing blackjack while kirk sits at the table
kirk tears up and puts his face in his hands
molly is passing
she sees kirk and stops
please tell me i didnt get you in trouble back there
its not that
i lost somebody today
molly sits down and puts her hand on his hand
oh my god
im so sorry
i lost my grandmother a few months ago and i
kirk tears up again and so does molly
your grandmother too
and you were close
oh you poor thing
kirk tries to keep it together
molly looks at the photo
she used to be a blackjack dealer at the horseshoe
when i was little she taught me and my friends how to play poker
turned us into a bunch of eight year old degenerate gamblers
they share a sad laugh
so your grandmother too huh
molly removes a small clear plastic booklet of photos from her bag and shows a picture of her grandmother
my grammy keenan was ninety four but independent right to the end
she was always trying to cook for everyone
you couldnt stop her
oh god i know
grammy used to change her own oil
right up until a few months ago
do you change your own oil
i wouldnt know where to begin
i know me neither
she could barley walk and id come over and find her lying under her cadillac all covered in grease
they share a laugh and kirk is cheering up a bit
an announcement comes over the pa
final boarding call for united flight to burbank
oh geeze thats me
im so sorry
go catch your flight
molly stands and offers her hand to kirk
molly squeezes kirks hand grabs her bags and trots off toward her gate
a businessman near kirks table reaches over and gives him a playful chuck on the shoulder
a nod and a cheek click nice one
molly arrives at the gate just in time to make her flight
kirk gathers his things and notices that molly left her pictures on the table
he looks through them
in the last pouch are some business cards that read molly mccall event planner
her cell number is on the card
molly is sitting in a window seat
the flight is mostly empty
the two other seats in her row are unoccupied until a creepy businessman moves from the row behind her to the seat next to molly
he casually smiles as though there is nothing odd about taking the center seat while the aisle seat and many full rows are open
molly looks at the vacant seats and then at him as if to say youve got to be kidding
how you doin
mollys phone rings and she fumbles to answer it
a female passenger sitting two rows back looks annoyed
whos calling please
from the coffee shop
you left your pictures with me
if you tell me which gate youre at i can run them right down to you
im already on the plane and were pushing back right now
okay well ill leave them at the lost and found and when you get
oh geeze some of those are my only prints
it would be such a huge favor if you could hold on to them for me
im coming back next week
but how will i
the female passenger hails the flight attendant
shes talking on her phone
the creepy businessman gives the woman the finger and then looks to molly for approval
he doesnt get it
i have your number in my phone
as soon as i get back ill call you and arrange to pick them up okay
thank you so much kirk
molly turns off her phone and holds it up for the flight attendant to see
im really sorry
you believe these pricks
so what do you do
kirk comes in and stops at the bar to order a beer
two men are waving to him from a table near the stage
kirk gets his bottle and snakes through the crowd toward his friends
on stage stainer in his afro wig plays guitar as his band finishes the last chorus of lovin touchin squeezin
were going to take a little breakski but well be back in a few minutes to do frontiers
the band turns to put down their instruments and the house music kicks in
kirk arrives where his friends are standing at a high bar table
devon looks like howdy doody at
jack is good looking and dressed semi hipster
devon gives kirk a hug
how you been holdin up
its been a rough week but you know all of the services and family stuff keep you pretty busy
i really miss her though
jack hugs kirk as well
she sounded like a hell of a lady
oh fuck yeah
kirks grandma was the shit
stainer arrives hugs kirk and gives him a kiss on the head
shes with god now buddy and you just know shes bustin his balls
kirk laughs and stainer raises his glass
the guys all raise their glasses and take a drink
this is just what grammy wanted and its cheering kirk up
kirks cell phone rings
he has to talk loud over the music
im sorry i can barely hear you
im at a club and
oh yeah its right down the street from there
okay sounds good
kirk hangs up
what was that all about
nothing just a passenger
she accidentally left something with me
shes going to stop in and pick it up i guess
shes coming here
she a cute gal
well alright dude
thats a leave behind
she digs you
no she doesnt
she does a leave behind and then just happens to be in the neighborhood
she practically has her hands in your pants
no seriously its nothing
shes way out of my league
dude you said marnie was out of your league and lets face it marnies kinda nasty
marnie is standing behind stainer
he doesnt miss a beat
dont you think marnie tomkins is kind of nasty
i dont know who that is
oh you dont know marnie tomkins
shes just this girl
i thought you knew her
anyway shes pretty nasty looking
but youre looking good
kirk im sorry about grammy
the guys slink away to give kirk and marnie some privacy
i realize she was never that crazy about me but i know how much you loved her and i hope youre okay
thanks ill be alright
listen are you going to branson with your folks next month
its not really my thing
whats wrong with branson
you too good for branson now
well your mom invited ron and i along
wed love to go but not if its going to be weird for you
kirk considers this
it will be weird
i mean the tickets are non refundable but its up to you
stainer overhears this and groans out loud
you should go
im sure youll have a great time
marnie hugs kirk
this makes him uncomfortable
kirk im sorry about what happened with us
youre going to make someone very happy someday but you have to get over me first okay
is it a deal
marnie hugs him again and then departs
shes going to branson with your fucking parents
and bringing her new fucking boyfriend
he seems like a good guy though
hes an entrepreneur
across the room they see marnie return to ron with a hug
kirk i know that guy
he owns a pizza hut
thats a business
its not even a real pizza hut
its one of those strip mall take out ones
they dont even have chicken wings
the guys a fuckin douche bag
hes got more going on than i do
thats all im saying
dude you can do a hell of a lot better than her
one door closes another door opens
fuck you devon that doesnt even make any sense
but take this broad thats coming here tonight i got a feeling about her
youre gonna get on that
i appreciate what you guys are trying to do but im telling you i have zero chance with this one and im completely okay with that
thats defeatist thinking
no it isnt
its just like saying ill never go to the moon and im okay with that too
youre saying you dont want to go to the moon
im saying that i never will go to the moon but im not going to get down about it because you know i never expected to
you dont know
technology and shit
you might go to the moon
kirk waves to someone at the door
the guys look up
the guys pov molly is stepping toward them dressed in a beautiful gown
they laugh the way you might laugh at a particularly brutal football tackle
yeah youre right
youll go to the moon before youll hit that
i told you
molly arrives at their table
there you are
molly hugs kirk
from across the bar marnie takes notice
here i am
im sorry im so overdressed
i just came from a work thing
are you doing okay with
oh you know
hey these are my best friends jack devon and stainer
the guys i
s drop like stones as they shake her hand
yeah just a nickname
doesnt really mean nothin
heres your pictures all safe and sound
kirk hands molly the pictures
thank you so much for taking care of them for me
i need to get some copies made
if i lost these
no trouble at all
hey have you eaten yet
i was going to go grab a bite
let me buy you dinner to pay you back
you dont have to pay me back
i want to
the place across the street has the best greasy burgers in town
a burger does sound good
then to the guys im going to just ah
molly waves goodbye and heads for the door
kirk starts to follow but stainer pulls him back for a quick huddle
its cool that shes buying you dinner but do not get your hopes up about this one
believe me i know
kirk catches up with molly
marnie watches them exit
a big guy has overheard this and leans over to stainer
good advice there friend
your boy aint got a prayer with that chick
you talking shit about my buddy
cause im giving out free fuckin ambulance rides
big guy assesses the crazy on stainers face and stands down
yeah i didnt think so
kirk and molly sit across from one another in a booth
the waiter arrives
start you off with something to drink maam
ill have a bass
and for your
oh im not her brother
oh im sorry
i just figured
you know what a bass sounds good
make that two
the waiter exits
you know what i do what about you
your card said event planner
howd you get into that
well it wasnt the original plan
i went to law school
ended up at a big firm but i hated it
then they asked me to plan the christmas party
it was a big hit and a few months later i was done with law
pernicious career move right
oh i dont know what that word means
what was it
close on mollys smile
she finds kirks unabashed admission very refreshing and endearing
like destructive or
no i dont think thats so perni
good new word
no not pernicious at all
not if you enjoy the work
i really do
we do a lot of charity events and i get to work with some of the most amazing human beings on some really fun projects
next month im doing a cancer benefit with billy joel
i love billy joel
the only downside is i have to do a lot of public speaking and ive always struggled with stage fright
oh man thats my number one fear
im terrified of getting up in front of people
id rather get a kentucky root canal
an older good looking man steps up to the table and stands facing her with his back to kirk
excuse me i was just sitting over at the bar and i was wondering has anyone told you today that you are absolutely stunning
are you seriously hitting on me right in front of my boyfriend
he turns to kirk and both men start to laugh
this is your boyfriend
oh yeah right
catches mollys unspoken instructions
im her boyfriend i guess so
the man gives kirk a wink and wanders back to the bar
did you get a load of that hair piece
what is it with men
i mean look at you
youre bald and youre fine with it
a little dignity is all im saying
the toupees and plugs and the teen dream sports cars
oh geeze im sorry
do you drive a sports car
i drive a taurus
its got am fm but i wouldnt call it a sports car per se
molly laughs and we hard cut through the following snippets of conversation as they eat chat and laugh
so heres this little old lady trying to go through security with six pounds of weed in her girdle
the food is being served
oh my god
i love that book
the waitress is picking up the empty plates
so a duck walks into a bar
molly is laughing while shes paying the bill
well ive got an early morning
i should go
thanks for coming along
this was really fun
and thanks again for helping me out
no thank you for dinner
i feel bad that you wont let me
oh stop it
listen i handle some of the charity events for the coyotes and ive got some tickets for the hockey game tomorrow night
kirk is a bit taken aback and confused
is she actually asking him out on a real date
i mean im free tomorrow night
she digs two tickets out of her purse and hands them over
i hate to see them go to waste
theres two so maybe bring stainer
kirks expression is as much relief as disappointment
kirk and stainer are on their way through security
a huge security guard runs a metal detector wand over stainer
whatcha runnin there a px
i dont know sir
the two hundred series are dog shit
you couldnt find a bazooka with that thing
you should look into the new eight fifties
can you keep it moving sir
kirk and stainer arrive at the third row to find two open seats right next to the penalty box
to kirks surprise in the next seat molly
kirk elbows stainer
hey its molly
you made it
thanks for coming
wouldnt miss it
thanks for the sweet seats
guys this is my best friend in the whole world patty
this is kirk and um stainer right
patty is over pounds with a pretty face and an edge that comes from a lifetime of taking crap from morons
nice to meet you
pattys my assistant and my go to gal
whatever you need she can make it happen on a moments notice
you need a cock shaped cake with a cotton candy bush delivered by four oclock
im your connection
oh and she likes to shock people so dont let her freak you out
how bout that
so were going to grab some beers
can we bring you ladies anything
patty cotton candy
stainer and kirk stand in the beer line
shes setting you up with the fat chick
that makes sense right
when molly was here i was like what
well patty seems cool
well yeah she has to be
what does that mean
the fat chick seems great
you never know bro that fat chick could wind up being the love of your life
kirk returns a look of annoyance
patty im saying
patty could be the love of your life
the game has started
kirk stainer molly and patty are cheering
the puck smacks the glass before them and another player skates up for it
as he mucks it from the edge he looks up and sees molly
hes distracted just long enough to get brutally checked face first into the glass
a penalty is called on the player who hit him
that player skates into the penalty box near molly
the name on his jersey reads reese
he speaks with a thick canadian accent
yer lookin good eh
that was a bogus call bobby
your skates barely left the ice
whats that aboot eh
nervously to reese yeah that ref is like a total blindo man
kirk mollys sister is blind
oh im sorry
i didnt mean
not offended oh i know
the radio announcers are calling the game
forty five seconds left on the power play and the sharks are knocking at the door
so after the game you wanna party
you know my policy on players bobby
and you might have noticed weve already got dates
the penalty ends and the ref opens the box but reese is not paying attention
come on molly
just give me a chance eh
im a great guy ask any of these assholes
the crowd is booing reese
reese youd better
you cant seriously be blowing me off for these two hosers
fuck you reese
you suck this year anyway
reese raises his squirt bottle over the glass and squirts stainer
stainer is immediately on his feet climbing the glass and trying to pummel the huge player
security is on him in a flash and dragging him kicking swearing out of the arena
reese wakes up and skates out of the box but its too late
the sharks score and the crowd revolts
a red haired redneck woman sitting two rows back calls out to molly and company
you idiots just cost us a goal
i hope youre happy
youd better check that tone reba
you do not want me comin up there
ill go see what i can do about stainer
no this is my fault ill take care of it
no its okay
i know the head of security
ill be right back
molly exits and patty sits back down next to kirk
god im really embarrassed
thats okay if reese did that to me id have gone over the glass too
but i would have landed a few before they got me
reese has been all over molly ever since she dumped her boyfriend
i tell you that girl has nothing but trouble when it comes to men
how is that even possible
tell me about it
im no lezbo but sometimes she makes me want to strap on if know what im saying
i think i do
its a curse looking like that
who has the balls to hit on her
just the most arrogant a holes like reese out there
yeah i suppose
listen molly brought me along tonight because you know she thought i might be interested
but just for honestys sake im not interested
i dont blame you
i know im no brad pitt
no im talking about your pal stainer
i know hes your friend but he seems like kind of a dumbshit
why would you think i was talking about you
i didnt mean to assume anything
oh my god
you dont have a clue do you
mollys really into you
oh yeah right
kirk laughs hard until he realizes that patty isnt laughing
pattys nod says im serious
a knockout like molly be interested in a spud like you
again no offense
but listen kirk your dream girl just showed up
try not to blow it
close on kirks terrified expression
the sound of a bowling ball demolishing ten pins
the place is crowded and classic rock is cranking
its an old alley with overhead projection score sheets
kirk stainer and devon sit and talk while jack throws a strike
atta boy jackers
it doesnt add up kirk
if mollys so into you why bring her friend and give you two tickets
she was hoping to set patty up with you
its okay she wasnt interested
so youre saying the hottest babe in the world wants you and the fat chick isnt into me
will you listen to yourself
what did molly have to say about all this
i dont know stainer somebody got thrown out of the game and i had to drive him home remember
pretty impressive catch kirky
theres no way
dont get him all worked up
her friend was fuckin with him
molly said herself that patty loves to mess with people
kirk you deserve a gal like her
and stainer why dont you try to be a little more supportive
why dont you try a little shut the fuck up devon
this week were not taking dating tips from the guy who met his wife in eighth grade
are we still bowling
stainer picks up a crappy beat up ball from the ball return
all im saying is shes just too hot
no judgement on kirky the guys just outgunned here
i cant argue with him
stainer goes to the line
the bowler a pro type with a custom ball and glove on the next lane is already standing about to roll
stainer starts to step up
yo house ball
i was up first
oh for fucks
what is it with you people
just wait your turn
all this noise and bullshit in this place and im such a distraction over here in your god damned peripheral vision
okay stains take it easy
the bowler stands glaring back
fuckin roll then
the bowler takes another minute to set
stainer lets out a long sigh
the bowler steps to the line and stainer rushes into his own delivery
both men throw gutters
the bowler comes at stainer but their friends separate them
youre lucky motherfucker
bring it brunswick
cool your jets buster
the bowlers friends drag him away
stainer takes a deep breath before he shifts right back into conversation mode
i love kirky but lets face it the guys a three
stainer thats just dirty pool
hes at least a four
youre outta your fuckin mind four
you go ahead and pump rainbows up his ass
im just being honest
stainer moves the score sheet and then writes a three on the glass
it projects onto the overhead scoreboard
i can live with three
hes a nice guy and hes funny
those are a half a point each
stainer continues the equation on the projector
but he drives a shit box so we gotta deduct a point for that
kirk said she likes his taurus
thats so fucked i wont even dignify it with a response
so were back to three
meanwhile this molly is a hard ten
a hard ten
generally if a broad is that hot you can deduct a few points for dumb or shallow but she went to law school and her sisters blind
thats a hard ten friends and that is rare
a seven point disparity thats a chasm
the most you can jump is two points
i cant even get a ten
oh not even you huh
im a five okay
then what am i
youre a seven and a half
fine youre a five then
okay so i get a two point bump for being in a band
that puts me at seven
on a good day most i can bag is a niner
what about your shitty car
im expected to have a shitty car
is there an artist exemption for being a jag off
fuckin a there is
patty was probably just messing around
its not a big deal
lets just bowl
what about rick ocasek
billy joel donald trump
those are the wild cards
money and fame
so if he were a millionaire
a mil aint what it once was jackie
devons practically a millionaire for christ sake
a mil might get you an eight but to bring down a ten now days two million minimum
stainer finishes the equation by writing kirk fucked
kirks phone rings
he checks the id and his eyes go wide
into the phone hey molly
um yeah sure
no that sounds good
yeah i know where that is
um okay yeah
see you then
kirk hangs up and gapes at his friends who wait in suspense
dazed pause she just asked me out for tomorrow night
kirk exchanges fives fists tips and hugs with devon and jack
stainer shakes his head still not buying it
kirk runs into the otherwise empty restroom
he stares into the mirror and his smile fades into panic
he splashes water on his face
he reaches for a paper towel but the dispenser is empty
to himself its okay
get it together
guys do this all the time
you can do this
you can make it happen
from inside a stall you better not be jerking off in the sink man
kirks taurus pulls into a space
he climbs out and slams the door
as it closes he reaches but too late
he looks through the window
the keys are hanging in the ignition
willy the russian driver is chipper and bubbly as he sings along with im like a bird on the radio
kirk is knocked around by willys crazy driving
in the mirror willy notices kirks dazed expression
thick accent kirk
you look like someone made a second number in your breakfast cereal
you are doing okay yes
you know what willy
i honestly dont know how im doing
he does not know
i should be doing awesome but i dont know
know what i mean
how are you
willy is having another kick ass of a day
willy takes a hard left and some suitcases fall on kirk
kirk is picking up a coffee
as he walks on he takes a sip
the lid comes off and hot coffee spills on his shirt
way to go big slick
stainer is now next to kirk who glares back at him as they walk across the food court
a short plain girl behind the orange julius counter gives them an apprehensive wave
lets go this way
stainer returns an uncomfortable smile but then redirects their path away from her
just some chick i boned once when i was drunk
you look like shit bro
i had trouble sleeping last night
this molly thing
i dont want to want this you know
it just seems too good to be true
i just dont get it
i know what you mean
there has to be some explanation
i cant think of one
not one that makes any sense
well lets spitball it a little
youve got dick for money so shes no gold digger
did you ever see double indemnity
please dont say she wants me to kill someone
maybe shes on a scavenger hunt
you know like find a wagon wheel a wiffle ball bat and a fat bald tsa agent that kind of thing
kirk is no longer responding
oh shit dude
think about it
youre a tsa agent shes a terrorist
kirk walks away
kirk still in his tsa uniform walks past a large laundromat to a small storefront next door
the chipped and faded lettering on the glass reads maury hammerstein attorney at law aggressive dynamic representation since
as kirk reaches for the door he notices a small hand written sign i dont make change
he goes inside
wood paneling buzzing fluorescent lights and furniture the salvation army would sell only as firewood
eric and debbie sit with kirks parents
there are two elderly women and another middle aged man in the room as well
maury whos about a hundred years old cute and meek fusses with an ancient vcr while smoking a cigarette
kirk sits down next to eric
kirk notices a free bank calender on maurys desk dated
its about time numbnuts
i came right from work
okay maury were all here
okay hi there kirk
firstly let me just say how awful sorry i am
stella was one heck of a gal and a real dish
anyhow let me just
maury gets the vcr going
wheel of fortune comes up on the screen
i didnt tape over her with the wheel did i
the picture goes to snow and then stutters into a shot of grammy sitting in her kitchen
she has just clicked the video camera on with a remote control
there she is
one two three four
oh this god damned thing
she gets up and fusses with the camera
jap piece of shit
is it on
cutaway to kirk tearing up
grammy sits back down
okay my name is stella edith dakin and if youre watching this im dead as a doorknob and i aint spent all my money yet
i got shit to do today so im going to get right to it
this is my last will and testament and if you miss anything the old jews got the paperwork
okay heres the deal
everyone besides kirk leans in excited to hear what they might get
a phone rings
maury looks around but the ringing is coming from the tv
grammy answers the phone
im kind of busy right now eric
oh for gods sake boy
how can you be sure its even yours
it could be practically anybodys
no im not paying for that
well then i guess youre going to be a daddy
congratulations now i gotta go
she hangs up puts on her glasses and lights up a smoke
i love all of you despite some of the shit you pulled but i spent my life a gambler and i always put my money on the best bet
the odds of any of you fish doing anything worthwhile with my stack are slim to none
so old grammys going all in on big slick
everyone looks at kirk who is stunned
im proud of you kirk
dont let your old grammy down
do something good with it
she blows a kiss lifts the remote and aims it at the camera
oh for christ sakes
she throws the remote at the lens
the picture goes to snow
so kirk gets it all
that is bullshit
eric it cant be much
maury digs into his desk and pulls out a mess of papers
he dons a pair of glasses that make his eyes look gigantic
lets see here
looks like she had herself six gs in savings
um another three grand in bonds give or take
her life insurance will pay pert near seventy grand
he adds this up on an old adding machine the kind with the hand crank and writes on a chalk board which is mounted on the wall behind him
she left him eighty grand
most of stellas retirement home expenses were covered by her reverse mortgage
but figure in thirty thousand still due to arborwood village
she racked up forty seven thousand in medical bills
and my fee of course which now stands at two thousand and change which is real reasonable folks
he writes liabilities total
so kirk owes money
that is god damn hilarious
the upscale restaurant is crowded
kirk and molly are eating at a small table
kirk is not relaxed like he had been the last time they ate together
he is sweating and trying to remain cool
the maitre d is eyeing them suspiciously
but you cant legally be held responsible for her debt
what kind of hack is this attorney
i had it in savings
the waiter brings a drink to molly
french accent madame
from ze gentleman in ze grey suit
from his table a good looking man smiles and raises a drink to molly
she nods back polite but annoyed
grammy hated owing anyone money
im afraid she couldnt rest if she wasnt square with the house
its the least i can do
she practically raised me
youre a good man kirk
molly smiles and takes his hands
the maitre d is watching and getting angry
the waiter returns with another drink
from ze gentleman in ze purple tie
another guy raises his glass to her from the bar
molly is getting irritated
kirk is feeling smaller every minute
listen no more drinks
no more drinks madame
this happens sometimes
yeah i get that a lot too
im sure the next one will be for me
the best looking man kirk has ever seen walks up to the table
he and molly hug
oh my gosh
i didnt realize you were in town already
i just flew in this morning
kirk this is talon
this is my good friend kirk
great to meet you sir
talon gives kirk a winning handshake complete with wink
so do we have you for our disabled angels program again this year
wouldnt miss it
to kirk mol is always a big hit with the kids
youre the one the kids go crazy for
so you two work together
only once a year
talon is our charity liaison at the air show
and my ex boyfriend
kirk starts to choke
he grabs his water glass and takes a swig but the ice collapses and the water pours all over him
i guess i better
kirk heads off to the bathroom muttering to himself
kirk is drying his shirt
a man is still zipping up as he takes the next sink
before washing he offers a handshake
my name is max fleming
im a financial planner
kirk takes the handshake reluctantly and then gets a business card
max then starts to wash up so does kirk
please forgive me but im curious
who manages your portfolio
i dont really
max takes the last paper towel forcing kirk to drip dry
its okay if youd rather not say
i admit that selling my services in a mens room is a tad aggressive but isnt that what a man of your means requires in his financial planner
judging by the company youre keeping id say that youre making a handsome living
i can help you do even better
kirk exits reading maxs card somewhat bewildered
the maitre d stops kirk and speaks in a french accent
excusez moi monsieur
might i have a word
is everything all right
the maitre d looks around and then leans in and speaks quietly now without the french accent
my kids eat here
my mothers here right now you son of a bitch
look i can appreciate that this is not some common street walker
youre obviously willing to pay for the best but we cant have this kind of thing at my place
im not paying anyone
were just on a date
you are on a date with her
what am i an idiot
now i dont wish to embarrass you sir or make a scene
so enjoy your dinner but be warned do not ever bring another professional into my place
louder and back into the french accent tres bien monsieur
when kirk rounds the corner he sees that molly and talon are still talking
kirk hides behind a plant
molly is beaming
she stands to hug talon and kiss his cheek before he exits the restaurant
kirk returns to the table
did i miss talon
he had to go but he asked me tell you how much he enjoyed meeting you
he uh seems like a great guy
i know i know the blue eyes and the rock hard abs right
but hes really so much more than that
a gallery in new york just opened an exhibit of his photography
hes a genius
to the waiter can we get the check
madame your bill has been covered by ze woman in ze raiders jacket
a butch woman in the bar raises a glass in mollys direction
molly and kirk pull into a parking lot
oh my gosh
this is your apartment
i used to live in this neighborhood back in college
yeah im gonna move to a better place pretty soon
we used to come to parties over here sometimes
can i come up and see your place
its friday night and several college parties are raging in the complex
kirk leads molly up the stairs and down the balcony hall toward his door
they pass a few college students on the way a couple making out a guy vomiting in a bush
two apartment windows are covered with tapestries of bob marley and a giant pot leaf
kirk and molly enter
the apartment is neat clean and fairly sparse
its not much i know
no i like it
molly walks around and examines certain items
kirk quietly hides a framed picture of marnie
molly passes his computer desk where she coos at a screensaver of baby polar bears
just as she passes it she bumps the mouse and the computer comes to life revealing a hot back door asians website
molly didnt see it and kirk scrambles to turn off the monitor
she turns to see what hes doing
she moves on to a rack of dvds
wow we have a lot of the same dvds
life of brian cool hand luke family guy
its a good movie
i love that movie
she spots a crate full of vinyl records
look at all this cheap trick
you like cheap trick
are you kidding
heaven tonight is the first album i ever owned
a hand me down from my big sister
she was the coolest person in the whole world
she notices an upright piano in the corner
you play the piano
my grandma taught me
it was kind of our thing
she was a great player
ragtime show tunes that kind of thing
im really not very good
she plops down on the couch
oh ill bet youre great
play something for me
no i cant really play in front of people
what the stage fright thing
come on its just me
no i really cant
trust me youre not missing anything
kirk decides to join her on the couch but then he balks into a little dance of almost sitting
he finally commits to sit
so youve never played in front of anyone
almost did once
a talent show in high school
i just sat up there drenched in sweat
i really thought i could do it but then i made my big mistake
let me guess
you looked at the audience
all these eyes on me
im shaking my head is spinning im trying to remember if i even play the piano
and then i puked
right there on the stage
into the piano actually
why would you do that
it was a reflex
i was trying not to barf on the floor
turns out its a lot easier to clean puke off a stage than out of a baby grand
yeah that has to be a real bitch
oh i shouldnt be laughing
you poor thing
molly brushes his hair back with her hand
kirk is frozen with fear
molly leans in
kirk also leans in but not too far
molly smiles realizing that its up to her to make this official
she takes him by the collar reels him in and kisses him
they make out for a moment
kirk is near panic but he does his best to keep it together
im a little cotton mouthed
im going to get a glass of water
how bout for you
a nice glass of you know
that sounds good
kirk steps away from her and disappears into
he pours a glass of water
hes about to return when he sees his reflection in the window
the boner under his khakis is not subtle
he looks down and starts to panic
you want anything to eat
kirk opens the fridge and thrusts his pelvis in
he takes a few deep calming breaths
he closes the fridge still at full alert
kirk searches the kitchen his panic building
he grabs a time magazine
he flips through frantically
he turns to a bikini model in an ad then a naked aboriginal women then bare breasts in a breast cancer article
oh come on
he is sweating like crazy
can i give you a hand
i got it
kirk finally flips to a picture of barbara bush
he stares at it hard
his boner begins to retreat
listen kirk i want you to know that i would really like to you know to be with you tonight
the boner pops back up
kirk silently mouths motherfucker
at his mischievous little man
i just dont think im ready yet
kirks reply is rushed with enthusiastic relief
you want some ice
kirk opens the freezer
he puts a few cubes in her water and then grabs a fistful and shoves his hand in his pants
molly gets cozy on the couch and looks even sexier
i mean dont get me wrong
i want to
believe me getting naked and crazy sounds fantastic right now
are you okay
kirk runs the water while he digs under the sink
he finds duct tape
he pulls some tape off the roll
it makes a loud noise that causes molly to pause and kirk to tense up
kirk opens his pants and begins taping down the trouble spot
he coughs hard to cover each subsequent tug of the tape roll
i just think we should get to know each other first
im no prude
i mean im pretty generous in bed
once i trust a person i like to experiment and get pretty wild
oh dear god
but i just need to feel safe first
kirk finishes taping up zips his pants and checks his profile in the reflection from the window
kirk returns with two glasses of water and no visible boner
im totally fine with that
youre the best
kirk gives an aw shucks head tilt
okay well id better go then
they walk to the door
molly leans in and they kiss a few moments more
kirk winces as the tape is getting a little snug
she drops her keys and then goes down on one knee to retrieve them
suddenly she starts coughing
she puts her fist over her mouth
kirks pov as her head and fist bob in front of his crotch
kirk winces again
she hears the tape start to give way
she looks up slightly confused
kirk looks around as though hes looking for the source of the sound
i had a really nice time
ill call you tomorrow
kirk opens the door for molly
as molly exits she gives him one last kiss
two studly male college students are playing foosball on their patio
they stop when one points out the hottie whos kissing kirk
molly trots off
that chick is fine
kirk returns a cool whassup nod to the guys
all right mr
you wanna play some foos
no thanks fellas
kirk beams from the attention as he goes back inside
he drifts over to his piano and sits down
the joy of what has just happened is plastered on his face
he launches into a furiously happy jerry lee lewis style romp
soon a neighbor is pounding on the wall
kirk stops playing
kirk continues his celebration dancing around the apartment
he picks up the picture of marnie and speaks to it
ron seems like a swell guy
i love pizza hut
why this is my girlfriend molly
oh dont be that way
oh there there now
heres a tissue
he drops the picture and continues the dance
kirk lies in bed staring at the ceiling fan
the smile continues as he drifts off to sleep
time lapses as kirk sleeps and the sun comes up
still smiling his eyes open like a shot and he reaches for his phone no missed calls
kirk gets up and goes into the bathroom
he checks his gut and hairline in the mirror
from under his bed he pulls out a total gym still in the box
it is dusty unopened and has a ribbon still attached along with a card that reads happy graduation love mom and dad
he sits in the living room bewildered as he reads the directions
the parts are spread out all over the floor
he works out on the machine but it soon violently collapses underneath him
he checks his phone
no missed calls
he throws away unhealthy snacks and treats from the cupboards
he opens an untouched box of healthy bran and fills a bowl
he watches cartoons as he heaps sugar on the healthy cereal and then checks his phone
no missed calls
he surfs the web
he reads info on the hair club for men site
he moves to hot or not
the first woman is very pretty
he rates her a seven the next is also pretty and gets another seven the next girl is very unattractive
her score is three
kirk feels bad for her and rates her a ten
he checks his phone
he moves on to backdoorasians
kirk watches a connery james bond movie on tv
the lower third reads amcs hours of bond
no missed calls
the sun is setting and bond is now roger moore no missed calls
kirk digs a box of ding dongs out of the trash and eats them as he watches
its dark outside and kirk is in bed watching timothy dalton no missed calls
the morning light is creeping in as pierce brosnan does the driving and kirk is still awake looking devastated no missed calls
kirk is at a convenience store buying milk
he is a mess tired unshaven wearing a frumpy sweatsuit
he passes the magazine rack and something catches his eye
its a gorgeous picture of molly on the cover of phoenix entrepreneur magazine
kirk holds up the magazine and then catches his own reflection in a mirror on a sunglasses rack
kirk is walking home
every street sign billboard and t shirt he sees reads no missed calls
he stands in the shower sulking
he hears the phone ring in the next room
he jumps out grabs a small towel and starts to dry off as he runs into the bedroom
he reaches the charger base but the phone is not there
he stands and listens hard to the ringing
he runs into the living room
angle on the phone
its hiding under a pillow on the couch
in the background kirk rushes around the room flipping up papers and magazines
the phone keeps ringing and kirks panic increases until he finally spots the phone
kirk dives for it losing his towel in the process
took you long enough
what were you doing taking a growler
kirk notices a woman on the landing outside behind him
she can see his ass through the window
he covers up
kirk and stainer come out of a record store and walk past the shops and restaurants
kirk holds a stack of flyers for stainers band
as they walk kirk hands flyers to stainer who posts them on walls and kiosks with a staple hammer
kirk its a simple rule of life
people are pretty evenly matched
kirk and stainer look at the couples that stand at the bus stop sit in the outdoor cafes and walk down the sidewalk
each couple is fairly closely matched pretty with pretty ugly with ugly heavy with heavy fit with fit
yeah but stainer she was the one who asked me out
that first night were you intimidated by her
no i didnt think i had a chance
so you were relaxed and funny
you were on
stainer posts several wheel in the sky flyers on a kiosk
so i gotta get back to that
thats just it kirky
now that shes opened the door you cant get back to that
so ill have to fake it
you cant fake that far
a broad like her shell smell that horseshit a mile away
kirk and stainer enter a
and take a table on the crowded patio
can we get a couple of menus
then to kirk you eating
maybe just a salad
dude one salad aint going make up for thirty years of chili dogs
but i got dinner with my folks later
be sure and stab your brother in the eye with a fork for me
sorry erics not coming tonight
kirk motions toward a mismatched couple nerdy guy with knockout girl who pass kirk and stainers table on their way to the valet stand
stainer rolls his eyes
you know what this is ridiculous
im just going to call her
fuck you are
put that thing away
you do not call her
dont you get it
talon is back in town
no she broke up with him
so youre telling me you were sitting there a sweating quivering stutter bucket and when you came back from the can mollys hugging a guy whos so good looking youd
probably fuck him
what do you think shes doing this weekend
so what am i supposed to do
what can you do
she hasnt called shes not going to
youre probably right
just count yourself lucky
you got to kiss a goddess and you got out before she recalibrated your hardware
a chick like that can raise the bar too high and then once she dumps you nobody else measures up
no youre right
you know what its good
im actually relieved
you should have seen this talon guy
all ive been thinking about is having to be naked in front of her
i dont need that kind of pressure
the valet pulls a red ferrari up to the mismatched couple and the nerdy guy opens the door for her
stainer shakes his head as if to say was there even a doubt
kirks phone is sitting on the table it rings
kirk and stainer can see mollys name on the caller id
dont do it
the phone rings again
kirk glances down at the phone
stainer keeps a stern eye on kirk
close on kirks eyes turning weak
close on stainers threatening eyes
kirk gives up and looks away
stainers eyes calm
kirk snatches the phone but stainer grabs kirks wrist pinning it to the table
cut it out
let it go
kirk reaches for the phone with his other hand but stainers free hand intercepts it and these arms flail around like battling snakes
kirk presses the button to answer the call and instead moves his head down to the phone
oh no problem
yeah i was super busy yesterday anyway
would you look at yourself
stainer lets go and kirk sits up and backs away
well i have dinner with my folks tonight
oh i wouldnt want to subject you to them
if you want to
i can pick you up
kirk gives a confident smile and an i told you shed call nod
stainer crosses his arms and shakes his head
well then let me call you back in a few minutes and ill give you directions
well i guess you just solved that
an hour with your family and shell file for a restraining order
erics not going to be there
its going to be good
you might be wrong about molly
stainer spots a round little boy posting a lost puppy flyer over one of the ten he just posted on the kiosk
to the boy whoa
i dont think so spanky
a little lower
the boy instead posts it over a walk for a cure poster
molly drives up and stops in front of a small home on a quaint residential street
she climbs out of her car checking the address on a small sheet of paper
she sees kirk sitting on the front porch
you found it
i had good directions
she steps up the front walk toward kirk who points to a little yellow note taped to the front door
my folks arent back yet
were locked out
you dont have a key
my dads kind of obsessed with home security
like someones going to break in and steal his readers digest collection
a very old man wobbles out of the house next door with a beagle on a leash
the man struggles a bit with the dog
well howdy kirk
hey what do say you take the night off and ill take noodle around the block for you
to molly are you up for a walk
that sounds great
geeze kirk thats mighty nice
kirk jogs over to take the leash
noodle jumps up on kirk
he and molly pet the excited dog
baby talk yes
always happy to see you pretty girl
yes you are a pretty girl
yes you are
molly takes note animal lover big points
youre a good boy kirk

molly and kirk start down the sidewalk with noodle
an old woman comes out of the next house with her dog on a leash
are you back in business
to molly i had a little neighborhood dog walking service when i was a kid
to the woman no problem mrs
d we can take norton along too
several soft faded cuts as kirk and molly move through the neighborhood
soon they have a third dog
kirk points out landmarks as they talk and laugh
now they have a fourth dog
molly takes his arm
the evening light is a bit dimmer as they give noodle back to mr
kirk turns toward his parents house
now theres a car parked in the driveway and a jacked up knobby tired pick up parked out front
the truck has two bumper stickers one nation under god
and no fat chicks
flanking a vanity license plate that reads erix toy
kirks shoulders slump at the sight of it
hey you know what im thinking lets go get chinese
what are you talking about
i want to meet your family
they start toward the door
mollys cell phone rings
im so sorry
ive got to take this
ill be right in
kirk comes through the front door to find his father in the living room watching a hockey game
without looking up kirk
eric steps out of the kitchen with three beers
close the door fucknut
i thought you were hanging drywall tonight
fuckin leroy fired me again
like that dick never came to work with a little buzz on
okay listen i brought a date tonight
i really like her
please dont embarrass me in front of her

eric and dad crack up
a flushing sound and then ron comes out of the bathroom
hes buckling up
kirks shoulders drop again
i did like you said mr
eric tosses ron and mr
kettner each a beer
oh hey ron
so marnies here
marnie appears in the door of the kitchen
shes holding a corningware pot filled with mashed potatoes
molly finishes her call
shes up the front steps and kirk lets her in
eric ron and mr
kettner are stunned
marnie drops the pot and it smashes on the floor in front of her
kettner and debbie rush out to see what marnie is gaping at
debbie still pregnant is immediately threatened by the way eric is looking at molly
everyone this is molly mccall
kirks never seen his family so impressed
he cant hide his grin
ron pops the cap off his beer and it overflows a bit
kirk molly mr
kettner marnie ron and debbie sit around the kitchen table and feast on a meatloaf dinner
eric is at the fridge grabbing a beer
marnie is angrily watching ron whose eyes are all over molly
you want another one dad
you read my mind
you two take it easy now
we have guests
then eric honey im sure if you apologize to leroy hell take you back
eric returns to the table with the beers
nah fuck him

ron looks offended and raises a palm to indicate that

molly smiles to reassure kirk that she can handle herself
you know molly im a business owner myself
a little restaurant
i wouldnt really call it a restaurant ron
we serve food that people eat
its a pizza hut with no tables
its a take out place
so molly me and debbie here are getting hitched

kirk raises his eyebrows into please behave yourself puppy dog eyes
eric shoots back an oh whatever sneer

i specialize more in fund raisers corporate events that kind of thing
right now im working on the annual benefit for the childrens cancer center
but youve done weddings
ive done a few
so what do you get for one
dad could you
dont get your panties in a wad kirk
hes just making conversation
geeze there are so many factors that affect the cost of a wedding

im getting a kick ass dress made out of actual checkered flags and eric is going to be in an orange tux with a big home depot logo on the
back and tony stewarts number on the shoulders
oh how fun
so whats the damage for supervising something like that
im just talkin ballpark
im aint gonna try and jew her down
before expenses my base fee for a non charity event is fifteen thousand
so id ballpark that somewhere around twenty five grand
fuck a duck
for a moment everyone is chewing and there is a break in the conversation
kirk is getting wound up tighter and tighter
so youre making a comfortable living you seem like you got your head together more or less and christ look at ya
what the hell you doing with numbnuts here
come on ma were all thinking it
molly im so sorry
no its fine
the truth is kirk and i are just getting to know one another but so far i think hes decent hes funny and
you know when we first met kirk asked me in all sincerity if i knew how to do an oil change
eric ron and mr
kettner each let out a quick burst of yeah right laughter
and youre right i dont but
i just love that he asked
a moment passes as they all process this
the women at the table all know exactly what molly means
the men are simply confused
kirk is funny
tell us a joke there sinbad
to kirk well i hope you can hold onto this one pumpkin
to molly when marnie broke up with him he was devastated for months the poor little guy
marnie looks up surprised and touched by the comment
kirk is mortified
no shit when you dump him hes liable to kill himself
kirk rubs his own head to keep it from exploding
molly calms him with a hand on his back
this move isnt lost on marnie
kirk splashes water on his face and then looks for a towel but cant find one
hes forced to use his sleeve
he is a wreck
he takes a deep breath and steps out into
to find marnie at the front door putting her coat on
are you heading home
got to get home and let peanut out
she wipes some lint off of kirks shirt sleeve
kirk you look really good
you do too
marnie smiles a sad smile
it was really fantastic to meet you molly
if you ever need a pizza
ron gives molly a hug that makes marnie as uncomfortable as it does molly
he then passes kirk as he crosses to the front door carrying a pile of foiled over paper plates
crack a window in there pirate
ron and marnie exit
kirk walks back into
kettner and molly are cleaning up
molly you dont have to do that
no its fine
you let us have some girl time
take these downstairs to your dad
she hands kirk a bag of fritos and shoes him through the basement door
kirks father has built a tacky little basement bar decorated with neon beer signs and erics old trophies and ribbons
kettner and debbie sit at the bar and smoke as eric stands behind the bar and serves them cocktails
kirk comes down the basement stairs and joins them
the hockey game wrap up highlights are running on a tv mounted above the bar
so what was the final score
you think youre hot shit now
is that it
look eric youve had a lot to drink tonight and
dont tell him what to do
to eric youre doing fine baby
you think youre better than me
well take a look around big slick

all your big brother is trying to say is that were worried about you
you show up here with that piece of ass
either youre fucking with us or shes fucking with you so which is it
look i know shes a little out of my league but
are you shitting me
i think we can all agree that debbie here is one wicked hot box
debbie smiles and squeezes erics hand
kettner nods and raises his glass
yeah and this molly makes her look like a pig
debbie lets go of erics hand and storms upstairs
this girl of yours is already startin shit
calling after debbie come on baby
kirk didnt mean nothing by that
look i dont know whats going on either but
im goin upstairs and gettin to the bottom of this
i think this gal is messing with my little brother and im not going to sit still for it
im sure shes just slumming or something and its all going to be over any minute but jesus christ
shell come to her senses without any help from you
shes up there with
kirk turns to point up the stairs
as he glances back he finds molly standing on the steps listening and frowning down at him
before kirk can get a word out molly storms out of the house
kirk runs upstairs but shes in her car before he can get out the front door
eric appears behind him
way to go numbnuts
you should have let me handle it
kirk stands at work searching habibs bag and looking grouchy
fuller monitors kirk arms crossed
habib lets out a long irritated sigh
im sorry man
kirk hands the bag back to habib and sends him on his way
randy another agent hands kirk a note
insert the note reads kirk we need to talk
im in the food court
stainer is now reading over kirks shoulder
well i guess this is it
im surprised she even bothered
the food court is crowded
kirk looks around for molly but does not see her
good you got my note
kirk turns to find marnie sitting at a table working on a burrito supreme
im sorry to bug you at work but this couldnt wait
kirk sits down
kirk i think i messed up
i see a change in you and i like it
so i was thinking that we should maybe
get back together
just to try it out you know
i dont know marnie
please dont say its because of this molly person
no i think i already screwed that up anyway
i was really worried about you with her
she seems like kind of a bitch
she is not
well she acts like shes better than everyone with her hybrid car and her la de da charity work
she doesnt do that at all marnie
youre just putting that on her
okay maybe so
this is what i mean
you never argued with me before
youre really growing
what about ron
if you want to get back together of course ill break up with ron
you mean youre still with him
im not going to risk being all alone just because you dont know whats good for you
come on kirk
deep down you know where you belong
youre right i think i do
say hi to ron for me
kirk stands and walks away
kirk and stainer are at the ticket gate
kirk pays for his ticket but stainer stands staring at him
this wasnt my idea
i aint dropping twenty bucks to go in there
god damned planes are in the sky
i can see em just fine from the parking lot for free
kirk begrudgingly buys stainer a ticket
kirk and stainer move through the crowd
stainer now carries a corn dog a giant soda and an armload of air show memorabilia including an inflatable f a hornet
shes working one of the kids charities
im guessing they might be down by the rides
whoa dude check it out
the blue angels
five men in flight suits and aviator sunglasses strut through the crowd in slow motion
they exude masculine confidence
those are the coolest guys in the entire world
think about it george clooney or derek jeter would trade places with those guys in a second
can you imagine the sheer magnitude of puss those fuckers tag
im gonna get em to sign my hornet
stainer runs toward them
he joins some kids and beautiful women who are already getting autographs
kirk spots molly working a charity booth
he crosses to her
she turns to him with a this better be good stance
i just wanted to apologize for last night
for my family
your family i can deal with
and for me
for what i said
do you really think im that shallow
you think i need to slum
i dont know what to think
you just have to understand that this is a new area for me
believe it or not i dont have gobs of experience with beautiful women
is that all i am to you
no but i dont have much experience with brilliant successful wonderful women either
this melts molly a bit
kirk this cant work if you put me up on some kind of pedestal
its not that i
when i was a kid we played a lot of baseball in my neighborhood
the worst part was picking teams because i was always picked last
like they couldnt start a friggin game without first establishing how much i sucked
so now you come along and make me feel like the first pick
what if i cant hit
molly softens and smiles
you already got to first base
just keep your eye on the ball
kirk nods and smiles back
molly steals a quick kiss
let me tie up a couple things and ill show you around the grounds
molly goes into a tent to speak to patty
kirk watches her with a calm relieved smile
boy she sure is something huh
kirk turns toward the imposing blue angel pilot standing behind him
the pilot removes his shades its talon
its kirk right
firm handshake excellent to see you again sir
youre a blue angel
yes sir a naval aviator
okay i get it talon is what your call sign
no its my name
then whats your call sign
oh id rather not say
just something the guys gave me
talon puts his arm around kirk and walks him away from the booth
anyway listen kirk is it fair to say that you and mol are close
yeah i guess
well i understand that fellas like yourself tend to have uniquely candid relationships with the women they befriend
am i right
fellas like myself
dont get me wrong
i have no problem with your lifestyle
what grown men do in the privacy of their homes is none of my concern
talon im not
hey im in the navy
i dont ask and i dont expect you to tell
talon looks over his shoulder to confirm they are alone
now i dont know what mollys told you about me but anything bad i deserve
i hurt that girl
i hurt one of gods own angels and ive regretted it every minute since
she speaks very highly
god as my witness i will make it right
i will get her back
can i count on you to put in the good word for me poncho
youre the man
talon embraces kirk in a tight hug
there you go
feel the tolerance
another blue angel calls over while signing stainers plane
we scramble in ten
talon finishes the long hug
he and the other blue angels walk off in formation
stainer rejoins kirk
that was talon
the blue angel guy
cracking up duuuuude
molly joins them
kirk and molly walk arm in arm through the air show crowd
kirks pov as every guy that passes checks her out
close on kirks proud expression
the blue angels take flight
close on the planes as they weave in and out of an intricate formation
a wider shot reveals that their jet trails spell out molly inside a heart
reverse to pan across molly worried about kirks reaction kirk trying not betray his insecurity and stainer trying to hold back his laughter
kirk and molly in a crowded movie theatre
she squeezes his hand and he smiles back at her
molly turns back to the screen and kirks smile quickly degrades into a dirty look
the shot widens to reveal who kirk is glaring at another man also with a date sits on mollys opposite side and stares down at her cleavage
the man looks up to meet kirks gaze and smiles back
he offers kirk a fist tap behind mollys head
annoyed kirk doesnt tap back
molly is oblivious to this exchange
as molly walks down a city sidewalk at night kirk has stopped to tie his shoe
when he trots after her to catch up he is tackled by two cops
nice try pervert
molly spins around horrified
its okay maam
this fat tub of shit was following you but we got him
molly angrily grabs kirk by the arm and frees him from the cops grasp
kirk in his tsa uniform addresses a group of patients at the childrens cancer center
he demonstrates a metal detector wand
molly sits with the kids who look bored out of their minds
suddenly the kids light up and kirk feels hes making an impression until he realizes that talon has come up behind him
talon is dressed in his flight suit and carrying an arm load of toy jets
the kids excitedly jump up and gather round talon some even hug him
dressed up and wearing party hats kirk stainer devon jack and about thirty others stand in a small classy restaurant
the place is decorated with balloons and streamers
a huge banner reads happy birthday katie
seriously whats with the banner
shes blind right
seems like they could have saved a few bucks there
patty runs in
here they come
is that really necessary
molly leads her sister katie into the restaurant
molly hugs katie
to stainer still think shes al qaeda
stainer brushes off the comment
molly waves kirk over
katie id like you to meet kirk
its so nice to meet you ive heard great things
oh thank you
molly raves about her big sister non stop
katie reaches out to feel kirks face
shes a bit perplexed by the result
two blind teenaged boys approach
is jerry with you
its so nice you came
to molly these are two of my star pupils robert and jerry
boys this is my sister molly
its nice to meet you
they each feel mollys face and then start elbowing one another like a couple of horny construction workers
a cake is brought in as everyone sings an unrecognizable but uncopyrighted birthday song
katie blows out her candles
whats your wish katie
i wish kirk would play the piano for me
kirks face drops
molly kisses her sister on the forehead as she has obviously coached the response
immediately patty is behind kirk pushing him
kirk tries to politely decline but now katie has him by the hand and is leading him to the piano bench
everyone applauds and cheers for him to play
i can barely play
come on kirk
for my birthday
kirk is sweating
he reaches for the keys but he is now white as a ghost
molly watches in suspense rethinking what shes done
kirks hands shake
he moves them around hunting for a place to begin
the party goers stare and the room gets quiet
kirk puts his hand over his mouth as though he might vomit
molly presses play on a cd player behind the bar
suddenly a cheap trick song kicks in over the restaurants sound system
katie jumps up to dance with her friends
kirk gets up from the piano and tries to laugh it off
talon appears behind him and puts a hand on his shoulder
its okay kirk
youll rock us next time right chief
oh hey talon
im glad youre here
i feel terrible about our little misunderstanding
i dont know what had me thinking you were a gay fella
molly tells me you two have been seeing each other
patty passes between them and gives talon a dirty look
shes got every right
id hate me too
then i want to congratulate you poncho
youre the better man
now ill step aside and truly wish you the best of luck
i wouldnt wish losing that girl on my worst foe
but make no mistake you blow it and ill be waiting in wings
love and war right chief
talon gives kirk a respectful military salute
kirk holds his forced confidence until talon departs
once alone kirks poise deflates and he plops down into a chair
the party goes on and katie opens a small present
oh its a dvd
whos this from
nobody claims it but jack and devon look at stainer
its closed captioned
patty and kirk are sitting and talking at a table that is away from the group
across the room talon raises a glass to them
patty gives talon the finger
what did he do
listen molly would kill me if she knew i was telling you this but im trying to do you a favor
molly has this physical
you know kind of like a birth defect
oh my god
its not a big deal but shes really self conscious about it
talon and some other guys shes dated have been weirded out and made her feel like a freak
what is it
its better if she tells you but if you cant deal with it just get lost now and dont put her through that heartbreak again
i wouldnt do that
cause if you do itll be your last conscious act
she stands cake
patty heads off to get some cake
kirk sits considering this information
he looks at molly
she is wearing a small black dress
she looks perfect in every way
kirk crosses the room and walks out to the
he throws his hands up in the air and does a happy dance similar to the one he had done after their first kiss
stainer devon and jack are around the corner as stainer and jack are smoking a bowl
devon hears kirks celebration and peers around the corner
he waves the others over
the guys come around the front to join kirk
playfully chipper my friends
whats going on
my troubles are over boys
its all going to work out
check it out molly has
wait for it
kirk pauses for dramatic effect and then puts his thumbs up
a birth defect
dont you get it
sure i get it
she needs a good guy like kirky cause the guys she dates cant handle it right
it sent talon packing
kirk and stainer high five
jack and devon look disturbed
well whats wrong with her
i dont know yet
patty just said she had a physical issue
well that could be anything
did she say it was a birth defect
she said it was something like a birth defect
what if its something really bad
i hope it is
i hope its something that would make most guys run screaming
it wont matter to me
i love her
thats cool that you love her but its pretty fucked up to be rooting for a harsh deformity
what if this is pattys way of telling you that molly is a man
hey if that chick has a dick ill suck it
kirk and molly are cleaning up after the party
kirk is relaxed and in a fantastic mood
patty gets her coat and hugs molly before exiting
molly sheepishly approaches kirk
kirk im so sorry about the piano thing
it was stupid of me
i know what you were trying to do
i wish i could have played for her but
well anyway thanks for all your help with katies party
i know it meant a lot to her
molly kisses kirk
now hes calm and kisses her back passionately
she smiles a naughty smile at him
they start cleaning up as fast as they can
kirk is beaming
kirk and molly enter her modern luxurious condo
kirk takes her coat
kirk opens a bottle of wine
he pours one glass to share
they sit on the couch talking
kirk is on
he is confident and silly and molly is eating it up
they are making out passionately on the couch
molly stands and extends her hand to kirk
kirk stands and his boner is impossible to miss
this time he looks down at it as if to say how bout them apples
molly laughs and leads him into the bedroom
kirk sits on the bed and molly goes into the bathroom
he lights a candle
he is now in a normal state of nervousness but nothing like he had been before
he pulls out a stick of gum
he chews it quickly and spits it out
kirk lies down and then sits up and then repeats this
he decides to sit
molly opens the door
she is wearing sexy ligerie and slippers
she looks perfect
she crosses to the bed and sits down next to kirk
they kiss but molly stops
kirk before we do this theres something im really insecure about and youre going to see it sooner or later so
hey take a look at me
molly smiles nervously
she stands in front of him crying game style
she removes her feet from her slippers and looks down at them
kirk looks down
even her feet are fantastic
dont rush me
she parts her toes
they are webbed
kirks face drops
kirk jumps up and paces around
thats the best you can do
this is your big flaw
if you cant handle it
i thought you were going to show me some kind of hairy growth or a third nipple or something i could work with
what the hell is wrong with you
you know whats wrong with me
ill tell you
im not a college graduate
ive never been to europe
i have a shitty job
i drive a shitty car
you want me to go on
because i can
so here i think that the perfect molly mccall is finally going to show me a good reason why shes messing around with the likes of me
and this is all you got
you cant wear friggin flip flops
kirk ive given you plenty of good reasons
i ask cute stupid questions
that doesnt get a three hooked up with a ten
not in this world
a three what
what are you talking about
what the hell is going on here
what are you up to
what am i up to
please tell me youre a terrorist
tell me youre on a scavenger hunt
just tell me something that makes sense because all youre doing is driving me nuts
hurt and resigned the only thing im going to tell you is that id like you to leave
are you fucking kidding me
kirk grabs his coat and heads out the door
molly slumps onto her bed and cries as the door slams
kirk is at his post looking terribly sad
stainer is working at the same lane and is obviously feeling bad for his friend
fuller taps kirk on the shoulder to alert him that habib is coming through
habib sees this and takes his bag straight to the search table where he opens it for kirk
kirk doesnt look inside
go on habib
habib steps off to his gate
fuller gets in kirks face
you think youre pretty smart dont you kettner
thin ice mister
kirk stomps away from the checkpoint
dont come back kettner
america is safer without you
stainer goes after kirk
kirk walks out the doors
stainer catches up to him and they walk down the busy curb at a quick angry pace
hold up man
what are you doing
you cant let her screw up your life
get away from me stainer
dont take it out on me
we both knew this molly thing wasnt going to work out
it aint my fault
its not your fault
its my fault for listening to all your
what the fuck you talkin about
all you did was fill my head with all this crap about threes and tens and how im not worthy
are you worthy of a chick like that
i dont know
but thats not the point
youre supposed to be my god damned best friend
you know what
i think you were jealous and you set out to sabotage us from the start
that is total bullshit
then why werent you there for me
what if she actually liked me
maybe with a little help i could have pulled it off
kirk steps onto an
willy the russian is behind the wheel and as happy as ever
a few others are seated on the bus
stainer follows kirk on board
they remain standing holding onto poles
it is kirk and his crazy friend stinker and they are most upset
willy steps on it and drives like a maniac knocking kirk and stainer around as they argue
kirk she was going to hurt you
look at me
im hurt now
willy occasionally blurts out mindless echoes of their argument which kirk and stainer mostly ignore like
hes hurting now
the longer this went on the worse it would have been
i guarantee it
you dont know what youre talking about
he does not know
yes i do kirk
i know exactly what im talking about
perhaps he does know after all
remember last year when you hardly saw me for about two months
i met my own perfect ten
smart cool and hot like you wouldnt believe
hotter than molly even
so how come i never heard a word about her until now
yes how come no word of this tina
i didnt tell anyone
i didnt want to jinx it
she was perfect
i was spilling over with
with fucking happy
two months into it she dumps me
and i knew it was coming
a girl like that
sooner or later she was bound to get a better offer
but it kicked my ass man
i was depressed for months
thats what that was
you said you had that fatigue syndrome thing
i didnt want everyone knowing what a pussy i was
dude it was a hurt i cant even put into words
what a pussy
i couldnt watch you go through that cause i love you man
youre the brother i never had
stainer leans over and hugs kirk
kirk doesnt hug back
you have a brother stainer
yeah but hes a cheese dick
kirks phone rings
he answers forcing stainer to let go
maury sits at his desk
geeze im glad i caught you
listen son i got something to tell you and dont get mad at me okay
cause this thing aint my fault
you might want to sit down for this
kirk slumps into a seat and listens looking upset and shocked
stainer stares at kirk trying to get a sense of what kirk is being told
patty sits behind a reception desk in a small but stylish lobby
a sign above her desk reads mccall events
kirk walks in
patty puts down her work and stares back at him
is molly in
you got some big red apples showing your face around here again
is she here
stainer bursts in sweating and panting
oh for christ sake
this one too
patty comes out from behind her desk
im warning you both molly has been through enough
you go near her and i will fuck you all the way up
stainer swaggers up into pattys face
patty throws an elbow and stainers head jacks back
she is instantly on him grabbing him in a headlock and punching him in the face
whos your mommy
whos your mommy
patty is isnt she
cut it out
i just came to tell her that something happened
something really major happened
patty stops punching and looks up curiously
stainer remains in the headlock also curious
patty punches him again
you shut your hole
to kirk what happened
first off im sorry
patty rams stainers head into the door
every time you say youre sorry dumbshit here gets his bell rung
patty slams him again
i know i was acting like an idiot
shes just so
well i was really having a hard time with everyone thinking i was mollys brother or her co worker or her gay friend or whatever
i mean nobody believed that we were together
its too late for this shit kirk
but ive got it worked out now
patty and stainer wait for it
kirk decides how to phrase it
my grandmother left me three million dollars
patty drops stainer on the floor
i thought she was a blackjack dealer
it turns out she bought stock in caesars palace back in the sixties
nobody knew she still had it
i dont think she even knew
so what does this have to do with molly
now it makes sense me with her
im a millionaire now
so what now you can afford her
i get it
its not a whore thing
now it works out in his own mind
he can relax and stop acting like a freak because now hes bringing something to the table
now that you say it out loud
i dont know
you know what kirk i told molly you were different but youre just as shallow and full of shit as the rest of them arent you
yeah maybe i am
kirk walks out
stainer is at his post watching the luggage on the x ray monitor
suddenly he sees kirk coming through followed by marnie mr
kettner eric and debbie still pregnant
they are all wearing bright yellow sweatshirts
stainer runs around the machine to hug kirk who looks a little numb
how you been brother
what are you doing here
me and marnie and the family are going to branson
so youre branson bound
stainer is referring to kirks shirt that reads branson bound in big letters
these were marnies idea
to make it easy for us to stick together
the others come through
their shirts are decorated likewise
come on kirk
i gotta go
stainer takes the boarding pass from kirks hand
relax your flight doesnt leave for another forty five minutes
to marnie ill meet you guys down at the gate alright
marnie isnt pleased but shes going along with it
eric calls back as they all head to the gate
long time no see
take care bro
why is he so nice all of a sudden
probably because im getting three million dollars next week
shit thats right
then so youre back with marnie then huh
yeah i know but its for the best
im more secure with her
im actually happy to be done with all that molly craziness
ron comes through security and over to kirk
hey pirate can you spot me a twenty
i want to get me one of them travel pillows
kirk gives ron a twenty and ron steps away
stainer is appalled
he calls after ron
how come im not a pirate
then to kirk dude do not tell me that hes going with you guys
he already bought his ticket and my dad likes him
its no big deal
look at me big slick
kirk doesnt look into his eyes
look at me
tell me things are good
dont be such a drama queen
things are fine
i gotta go
it was good to see you kirk
they exchange an awkward handshake
kirk walks away
stainer stands alone watching him go
stainer tightens his jaw and runs his fingers through his hair
finally he kicks his head back and with great determination he stomps off in the opposite direction
follow stainer past security dodging passengers and carts
he arrives at the
stainer marches up to the orange julius
a short doughy plain girl works the counter
this is the same girl that stainer had claimed to have boned earlier
shes wearing an orange visor and rubber gloves
several customers are waiting but stainer moves to stand in front of her
she looks up from her smoothie
she has drink powder on her face
she groans to see him
elmer ive got customers here
tina i need to know right now why it didnt work out with us
she hands a smoothie to a customer
thats a large julius
this is important
i was good to you
i was sensitive right
hey desperado you gonna order something or what
stainer gets in the customers face
the fuck you just call me
oh for christs
can you cover me
a large crowd of passengers are waiting to board
the gate agent makes an announcement
okay folks were going to start by boarding the a group
all as are now welcome to board
marnie butts into the line
look ive got seven people in my party so were going to need to board right away
are you folks in the a group
what difference does that make
well because you seem like a little bit of a b
may i see your boarding pass
were not in the a group but were still getting on next
she hands him the pass marked c
oh it looks like youre a raging c
so youre gonna want to take a seat until your group is called
she stomps away
stainer and tina sit at a table
he sits with his head down like a sad little boy
she pities him
i really liked you elmer but all that stuff about me being a ten and how lucky you were and always checking up to see if i was going to
well you did dump me so
what could i do
you were all up in my business all the time
i couldnt breathe
it was my stupid job wasnt it
you were embarrassed
i work at orange julius elmer
if you would have just chilled out and been yourself
okay i can do that
she holds up her finger with an engagement ring on it
stainer drops his head onto the table
tina rubs his hair for a second and then walks away
kirk is somber as he finds his seat near the middle of the plane
from two rows back eric reaches over some other passengers to tap kirk on the shoulder
tom fuckin wopat bro
eric hangs up a high five and kirk leaves it hanging
kirk takes a seat on the aisle next to marnie
he gives marnie a forced smile
she puts her head on his shoulder
pan over to the window seat where ron sits watching them wearing his new travel pillow
suddenly there is a commotion at the front of the plane
you dont have authority on board this aircraft
stainer barges past the flight attendant holding up his tsa badge
its okay folks
this guys drunk as fuck and he shit himself
we gotta get him off the plane
stainer grabs kirk by the shoulder pulls him out of his seat and about two rows down the aisle before kirk overpowers him and stops
what are you nuts
you were right
i messed you up
we gotta fix this thing
believe it or not this isnt about you
in fact its none of your business
in junior high i peed my pants in class and eric started calling me stainer remember
pretty soon everyone else started calling me stainer because they knew it would make me cry
then you told me to own that name to call myself stainer so nobody could hurt me with it anymore
whats your point
my point is
i was just in the crapper and i had this thing all worked out
the pilot is now behind stainer and towering over him
sir im going to have to ask you to exit the aircraft immediately
stainer turns into his face
im going to have to ask you to fuck off immediately before i feed you your own fuckin teeth
the pilot backs up and goes for help
youre going to get arrested
and i wont be here to bail you out this time
that was my point
you saved me
that time and a bunch of other times too
you gotta let me save you this time
its my turn
your grandma didnt leave you three million bucks so you could take these a holes to branson
eric gets up and steps into stainers face
in mid sentence and without pausing stainer zaps eric with a stun gun
eric sails back into his seat as stainer continues
these people hardly know you
stainer i appreciate that you think youre helping me but im with marnie now
kirk marnies a fuckin bitch
to marnie all due respect
hit him kirk
or else i will
fuller and two other security people enter the plane
the pilot briefs them on whats happening
you said marnie makes you feel secure but security is bullshit
look at our jobs
its all for show
for all we know theres a bomb on this plane right now
the other passengers gasp and most of them look at habib who sits a few seats behind kirk
fuller grabs stainer by the collar
you want to see what i think of security
stainer turns and punches fuller in the face knocking him backwards onto the other agents
oh stainer what did you do
when i added all this up for you i made one big mistake
you are a ten
youre a ten man
kirk just stares back
fuller and the agents grab stainer but he clutches a seat and stays put
youre not buying any of this bullshit are you
stainer loses his grip and the agents drag him off the plane
kirk sits down and marnie comforts him
over a bummed out song we see different areas of the airport
people on moving sidewalks
people on escalators
bags moving around on a carousel
people in line
flight arrival and departure times
food trays moving down a buffet
bags moving by on the x ray monitor
people walking like cattle to their gates
through the crowd we see a man running against the traffic
molly looking beautiful in a formal gown moves through a sea of tables
hundreds of formally dressed people are seated around the tables eating dinner
molly greets kisses and shakes hands with several people as she goes
kirk is huffing and puffing as he rounds the corner and arrives at the checkpoint
he looks around frantically
randy points to a room marked airport security authorized personnel only
kirk bursts in to find stainer bent over a metal table
fuller with two black eyes and another agent hold him down as a homeland security agent stands behind stainer giving him the full cavity search
kirk doesnt miss a beat
i dont have a car here
i need your van
the keys are in my jacket
a jacket is hanging by the door
kirk reaches in and grabs the keys
he turns fast and exits
fuller jacks stainers head onto the table
the door opens more slowly and kirk regards his friend with great reverence
stainer strains to lift his head against fullers strength
dramatic pause and music its three on the tree and the clutch sticks
stainers head is jacked back onto the table
this room is set up as a staging area for the cancer benefit
patty and several others are buzzing around preparing for the next phase of the evening
molly enters holding a walkie talkie up to her head and speaking into it
no i need the staff ready to help with bids when the auction begins
i dont think we can spare anyone over
patty grabs the walkie talkie
were not here to feed these people were here to cure fucking cancer
now i want every one of those motherfuckers back there taking bids in fifteen out
patty tosses the walkie talkie back and then crosses to help a group of young cancer patients some in wheelchairs to unpack their sculptures and label them for the auction
a stressed out woman in a beehive hairdo picks up a small boys sculpture
she hails molly
mccall weve got a big problem
what is it
this young man has made an ashtray
well what do you want from me
kids make ashtrays
its a cancer benefit
dont you think this sends the wrong message
its a really nice ashtray
theyre not bidding on the artwork theyre bidding on the kids
beehive sighs hard and hands the ashtray back to the boy
molly turns around and a look of surprise comes over her
what are you doing here
reverse to show talon holding a ridiculously large flower arrangement
i came to say im sorry and to put in a request for a second chance
mccall the auction is underway over
i have to get in there

im looking forward to it
the emcee is taking bids on a little sculpture of an abstract four legged animal
timothy briggs sculpture of a
sold to the woman in the green dress for four hundred fifty dollars
congratulations maam and thanks so much
molly picks up the small boys ashtray and joins the emcee on stage
she takes a deep breath before facing the crowd
our next item
well here she is folks the woman who donates her time to make this amazing event possible our own molly mccall
im so sorry for my tardiness
the next item up for bids is from nine year old walter benegan

little something that you can put your paper clips or do dads in
oh who am i kidding its an ashtray
audience laughs lets start the bidding at one hundred dollars

the small boy hangs his head
he was hoping his piece would fetch more
his mother pats him on the head
two seventy five going once
ten thousand dollars
the small boy looks up elated
the spotlight searches the room and lands on kirk near the back
the audience applauds

talon stands across the room crossing his arms in defiance
eric bursts in through a door near kirk
fifteen thousand five hundred

the crowd applauds

fifty thousand dollars
eric makes a fist to indicate that its time for the killing blow
kirk nods back his agreement
three million dollars
erics eyes go wide
this is not what he had in mind
the crowd erupts into laughter
talon also laughs off the bid
kirk thats your entire inheritance
the crowd shifts from laughter into excited chatter
folks calm down
i dont want to get anyones hopes up
its only fair that i clarify something to the bidder
kirk please understand that if you commit this money we will all be eternally grateful and i think your grandmother will be very proud of you
but it doesnt change anything between you and me
this sets off a volley of whispers among the crowd and puts a smile on talons face
so again is this a serious bid
kirk looks to molly then his brother who is shaking his head no
he then scans the hopeful expressions on the faces of the kids and their parents
kirk takes a deep breath
three million dollars

sold to the man in the branson bound sweatshirt
the crowd cheers
congratulations to little walter whose ashtray has brought in more than any piece in our history
the young sculptor beams
the crowd cheers again
kirk gives a smile and a nod of resignation as he leaves the room
kirk and eric sit at the bar each nursing a drink
eric is fuming

kirk turns to find that he is sitting next to billy joel who is smoking a cigar
eric passes him the ashtray that kirk just bought

joel places a cocktail in front of kirk and then clinks his own against it
ladies and gentlemen please welcome the piano man
and our foundations greatest champion
the crowd cheers as the curtain rises
the crowds excitement turns to confusion
from the back of the room molly notices the crowds reaction
she turns to see kirk seated before the huge white grand piano his hands sweaty and shaking over the keys
kirk looks at the crowd
hundreds of confused faces stare back at him
beehive rushes patty in a panic
arent you going to do something about this
lady he just gave three million dollars
he can go up there and try to blow himself for all i care
kirk wrings his hands as they shake harder
billy joel stands in the wings and gives kirk a nod of you can do it
molly turns to walk away but notes ring out from the piano and she stops
kirk plays and sings just the way you are badly
his voice and hands shake but he forges on
the audience is confused cringing and restless
someone starts booing
kirk cant help but glance up to see who it is its eric
when kirk reaches the instrumental break he settles in a bit he can actually play
as the last note fades kirk leaps up and runs out into the
kirk bursts out the door and vomits into a dumpster
he falls backwards against the wall and slides down into a sitting position
you realize that theres a good chance this wont work out
molly steps out into the alley
and you could get hurt
and youre going to have to be naked in front of me at some point
i can work up to that
kirk stands up
so you and me are
three million dollars for kids with cancer and you sing to me
im not made of wood you know
molly hugs him
the first intro riff of a piano version of pressure kicks in and the crowd inside goes crazy
but one condition
you have to go brush your teeth right now
talon walks out into the alley still holding the flowers
can we finish our conversation
kirk takes mollys hand and leads her past talon
sorry poncho shes with me
close on a preacher
the vows you have just heard are a unique expression of the love between two souls
close on kirk looking dapper but sweaty and nervous
two souls who have come together this day in holy matrimony
close on molly looking more beautiful than ever
and by the power vested in me by the great state of nevada i now pronounce you husband and wife
you may now
a wider shot reveals the nascar theme wedding of eric and debbie
kirk stands among the groomsmen
each are dressed in tuxes that represent the colors numbers and sponsors of certain drivers
molly stands among the bridesmaids
each dressed in a checkered flag gown
ron and marnie are also in the wedding party
debbie hands her mulatto baby to the preacher so that she and eric can share a disgusting wide open mouth kiss
debbie grabs erics ass while eric gropes her breasts
stainer and wheel in the sky kick into any way you want it from a bandstand nearby
patty dances in front of stainer he winks back at her
devon cuts up a wedding cake that looks like a full sized racing wheel and tire
the guests throw rice as eric and debbie run to a stretch nascar limo
eric picks up debbie and loads her in through the window
he then runs around to the other side and jumps into that window
the limo burns rubber as it peels away
pan across the guests as they wave goodbye devon and his squeaky clean family jack and a hot date mr
kettner marnie ron
patty and stainer making out
kirk and molly stand together arm in arm
kirk holds a ceramic urn painted with the las vegas skyline
push in on the urn until the skyline becomes real
push in toward the top of the stratosphere casino
continue pushing in until we are inside the observation deck
push through the gift shop where the tv is tuned to cnn
as we pass the tv we hear
in a press conference held earlier today nasa officials announced that affordable tourist travel to the surface of the moon will be a reality within the next ten to fifteen
push past the tv out of the gift shop and to the other side of the observation deck where we find kirk and molly
they kiss before they open the urn and pour grammys ashes over the side
