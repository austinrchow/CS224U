written by megan holley rose lorkowski drives through albuquerque
she passes small adobe houses the air force base parched earth playgrounds university cafes and other distinctive sights
on the highway she passes under the freeway interchange a tangle of rust and turquoise ramps
the sandia mountains rise in the distance as rose heads up to the nicer neighborhoods of the foothills
rose pulls up to an expensive looking spanish style house and parks
she gets out of the car pops the hatch and pulls out a vacuum cleaner and assorted cleaning supplies
rose drags a vacuum cleaner into a room where expensive decor collides with the debris of a recent party
she collects beer bottles from end tables book shelves and house plants
cigarette butts float in cocktail glasses
rose plugs in the vacuum cord and glances out the sliding glass doors
a group of twenty somethings frolic in the pool
a lanky trust funder slides open the door and drips water onto the carpet as he makes his way to retrieve a cold beer
he brushes past rose on his way back out
rose turns on the vacuum and wonders if he even saw her
the space is packed with every kind of snack imaginable
joe lorkowski talks as the owner stocks shelves
ive got the five stores here and then two in rio rancho
see if were talking that kind of volume i can absolutely massage the numbers a little
seriously youre not gonna be able to keep it on the shelf
joe pulls out some order forms
yeah id need to look at some things before i can place an order
the owner looks at joes business card
how about i give you a call if i decide to ill call you
not a problem
no problem at all
even better ill swing by
youre on my route
how bout that
ill swing by tomorrow
yeah tomorrows not good
thats better anyway
thatll give you a chance to take a look see on those other stores
well put everything on one order and get you a good price break
the owner seems to consider the offer
joe scans the shelves
my advice to you weed out some of this weaker product to make more space for the corn
joe reaches over and grabs a packet of organic fruit bar
apricot fruit leather
whose bright idea was it to stock that
i mean come on what self respecting kid asks his mom for apricot fruit leather
the owner is not amused
joe pulls a hand cart stacked high with fancy corn canisters to his rusted monte carlo
through the glass pane we see disgruntled waitress norah lorkowski
she appears to be in a heated argument with mr
kim the restaurant owner
a customer watches the exchange with amusement
norah takes off her apron throws it at mr
norah exits the restaurant
kim trails her
kim notices and joins the fray
you are fired
i so dont care
norah flips him off and walk down the street
as she continues to walk she realizes that quitting her job might not have been the best decision ever
a banana floats in the toilet
oscar lorkowski smiles and kicks the flush lever
the banana is sucked down the drain
well not quite
oscar watches water fill the basin and spill onto the floor
oscar turns and walks out
oscar steps from the bathroom and walks quickly down the empty hall
a businessman removes a single shotgun shell from the glove compartment
he drops it in his shirt pocket sprays breath freshener in his mouth and gets out of his car
the businessman approaches the gun display and points to a shotgun
an employee hands him the gun and turns his attention to another customer
the businessman reaches into his pocket and pulls out the shotgun shell
draws the barrel up under his chin
a bubba pricing camouflaged vests nearby notices the businessman
his expression shifts from concern to alarm to horrible anticipation
he braces for the
police mill about and question people
carl swanson a ish man sporting a crew cut and a above and beyond polo shirt talks to the store owner
yep these shotgun cases are a real pain in the ass
what we call a wide field of contamination
carl contd guys all over the place and every little glob of hims a biohazard
the owner rubs his temples
gonna lose some inventory
trust me you do not want some lady suing you cuz she found this guys tooth in her brand new fanny pack
a above and beyond worker in a polo shirt waves his arm to get carls attention
hes over here in fishing too
yep a real pain in the ass
carl walks over to his assistant
detective mac macdowell approaches the owner
were wrapping it up
three grand just to have the asshole wiped up off the floor
can you believe that
mac and another detective walk toward the entrance
hey can you handle the report tonight
i gotta thing i gotta do
a blonde thing or a brunette thing
rose steps from the shower
she is attractive with sharp features and eyes that hint at future crows feet
her confidence has grown brittle by the gnawing fear that life peaked as the captain of the high school cheerleading squad
a note taped to the bathroom mirror reads you are strong
you are powerful
you can do anything
you are a winner
rose wipes condensation from the mirror to reveal her face
i am strong
i am powerful
i can do anything
i am a winner
she doesnt look like she believes it
norah lounges on her bed and loads weed onto a jerry rigged pop can pipe
the fact that we have sex real coitus sex means im under no obligation to blow you
norah fires up the bud inhales deeply and passes the can to randy a good looking redneck in his early s
i think youre scared of it
the phone rings
norah opens a book about sign language and starts practicing the sign alphabet
a b c d e f
f is a hard one
holding in the smoke im not scared of it
you just need to get better acquainted
randy stands and takes off his pants
the phone rings again
yelling dad get the phone
theres absolutely no pressure here
randy lies next to norah naked from the waist down
norah ignores him and continues forming letters with her fingers
she jots a note and sticks the pencil behind her ear
the phone rings again
norah reaches across randy and picks up the receiver
you can touch it if you want
into phone hello
through receiver you havent left yet
damn it norah my class starts in fifteen minutes
into phone i know i know
as norah holds the phone her eyes slide from randys face to his off screen penis
she takes the pencil from behind her ear and in the way youd poke a hamster to see if it is dead or merely sleeping prods randys off screen penis
joe sits in the living room busily putting stickers on cans of fancy corn
norah and randy enter from norahs room
doesnt rose have her thing tonight
i need to borrow your car
take some corn
randy and joe share an awkward silence
im really nuts about your daughter mr
give me a hand with this
they put stickers on popcorn cans
i see they sold that house across the street
i bet theyll come knocking on your door soon
they can knock all they want
wait wait whaddaya doing
dont put the lime sticker on the cheddar can
maybe i better just do this myself
randy pulls up to a small house and stops
norah gets out collects the canister from back and heads inside
norah enters the tidy two bedroom house with a barrel of fancy corn under her arm
im gonna be so late
oscar runs from the bedroom and flings himself onto norah
pale and skinny oscar is the kind of kid easily picked off in slaughter ball
i brought fancy corn
looking for her purse how can you eat that stuff
norah and oscar both jam a handful into their mouths
hell be hyper all night
rose finds her purse and quickly puts on lipstick
she leans down and gives oscar a kiss on the forehead
she turns to norah
and no lobsterman stories
he had nightmares all week
opening the door just use some common sense
rose lies on her back being fucked
her head nearly hits the headboard with each thrust
you want me
rose closes her eyes
her head starts to thump the headboard
oscar and norah lie in oscars little bed
oscar holds the covers tight under his chin
norah drinks a beer
theres a half eaten canister of fancy corn between them
hes slowly freezing to death and he knows lobsterman is out there
coming for him
and hes totally screwed because his tongue is stuck to the mailbox
why did he lick the mailbox
i dont know
maybe he had ocd and he was obsessed with licking mailboxes
why wasnt he in school
are you gonna let me tell the story
an then he hears a horrible sound
snap snap drag
snap snap drag
lobsterman is coming
maybe he didnt go to school because he had the acd
norah looks at oscar
norah downs the last swig of beer and sets the bottle down next to another empty
if he doesnt rip the skin off his tongue and make a run for it lobsterman will tear him to pieces with his razor sharp claws
curtains drawn in the cheap hotel room
rose gets out of bed and pulls on her clothes
mac watches for a moment then rolls out of bed
mac shakes his head and pretends not to be
i dont know why you did that
you should hear the way he goes on about his lean body mass index bullshit
drinking that antioxidant protein powder enzyme crap all the time
mac limps over to his clothes hanging over a chair
when was the last time you even played basketball
he needed to be brought down a peg or two
im sure you pulling a groin muscle humbled him
rose smiles and mac pretends to be offended
i should introduce him to your sister
norah and a cop
that would happen
mac shrugs and steps into his slacks
we were working a scene today where this guy offs himself in a sporting goods store
so they had this cleaning crew out there right
you would not believe how much money they charge for that shit
with the dead body there
naw the bodys gone its just the blood and stuff
rose peels the backing off a nicotine patch and carefully sticks it on her arm
you ask me its a racket
you should get into that
rose slips on her blouse looks at mac
you think thats all i can do
clean other peoples shit
he sighs come here
rose steps toward him and eyes mac as he buttons her blouse
you know thats not what i think
i am gonna be a real estate agent
rose rubs the nicotine patch on her arm
mac nods and smiles
with business cards
norah holds a lit joint out the window and watches a cheesy tv movie circa
big hair and leg warmers
norah leans out the window and exhales takes another toke
the sound of a key at the door prompts norah to quickly stub out the joint and close the window
rose opens the door
its about time
i thought your class got over at
rose looks at oscar sprawled out asleep on the couch
why isnt he in bed
said he was scared
i think he was fakin it though
rose fumbles in her purse and pulls out a ten dollar bill
im not taking money
its just ten bucks take it
dad told me about you getting fired
norah makes a face like great here it comes
what were you stoned or something
norah waves her hand dismissively
it was just mr
kim being a dick head
i thought you liked mr
yeah before mrs
kim started working there
now hes a full on gym teacher i swear to god
when are you going to grow up and start taking responsibility for oh please you love it when i fuck up
me screwing up gives you the hugest woody
shut up and take the ten
norah takes the ten
rose looks at the tv
there was a diner scene earlier
with a waitress
rose looks at norah
norah smiles and opens the door to leave
completely pie free
rose wraps the vacuum cleaner cord while another molly maid wipes down the last window
through the window a smartly dressed pregnant woman walks toward the house with shopping bags in hand
the ladys here
rose nods and heads downstairs
paula datzman mead sets her bags down on the table and fishes a checkbook from her purse
rose enters with the vacuum cleaner in tow
were all finished
since its our first visit we did the blinds and appliances but normally well alternate those weekly
nobody mentioned anything to us about laundry so we didnt bother with that but if you want laundry included there is an extra
startled rose looks the woman in the eye for the first time
its paula datzman
cheerleading squad junior year
recognition punches rose in the face
how are you
im paula datzman mead now
were expecting our second in a couple of months
paula pats her swollen belly and rose forces a smile
how are you
you look just the same
god i always envied you so much
dating the quarterback
so did you and mac end up getting married
awkward silence im not sure
i think he ended up marrying heather volkman
well its so good to see you
let me get your info so i can send you an invite to the baby shower
paula gets a piece of paper and a pen and hands it to rose
itll be like a big reunion
the whole gang from high school will be there
rose writes her number and address on the scrap of paper
so what are you doing now
paula immediately regrets the question
ive just gotten my real estate license and so
this is just kind of a temporary thing and im about to just really phase over into the real estate full time
youre kidding im in real estate
paula pulls a business card from her purse and hands it to rose
the card has a picture of paulas smiling face
with long and foster
who are you with
you know i havent really decided yet
i might check out long and foster
maybe youll just be independent
they grasp for something to say
what was that about the laundry
rose caries a vacuum cleaner and bucket of cleaning supplies out to a rusted nissan sentra with a molly maid door magnet
she throws the vacuum and bucket in the back hatch starts to close it then stops
rose walks to the side of the car peels off the molly maid magnet and throws that in as well
she looks at the datzman mead house with a mixture of resentment and shame
she gets into the car and cries
her cell phone rings
she digs the phone out of her bag and tries to steady her voice
oscar sits outside the counselors office on a bench
he cranes his neck to watch the secretary typing forms
rose sits nervously across from the school counselor a serious man in his mid forties and a teacher with cotton candy hair
the man speaks first
its not just this incident
there have been several episodes over the past year where oscar has
has engaged in disruptive behavior
rose shifts her eyes from the counselor to the teacher and back to the counselor
there was the incident in gym class
i did pay the damages for that
and the chalk thing
rose bites a fingernail
and the time he locked jeremy johnston in the okay
what did he do this time
rose looks confused
i will not tolerate it
i will not tolerate that behavior in my classroom
oscar has started licking things in the classroom
rose looks even more confused
first it was the pencil sharpener
then the aquarium
the secretary stops typing and offers a sympathetic glance to oscar
he capitalizes on the moment by licking the wall
and its disturbing to the other children
the secretary recoils and returns to her typing
the counselor leans forward with genuine concern
we think oscar might benefit from an environment where he could receive more specialized attention
he licked my leg
oscar finds joe asleep on the lazy boy
he snores in that scary sleep apnea way holding his breath between snores
oscar notices a leather strap hanging down from the top shelf of a book case
he pulls up a chair to investigate
the strap leads to an old pair of binoculars
behind it dusty books about birds
oscar grabs the binoculars and climbs down
oscar holds the binoculars to his face but the lenses are too far apart
oscar compensates by closing one eye and looking through only one lens
he focuses on his grandpas nose hair
whered you get those
oscar points to the book shelf
something sad stirs in joe
oscar steps closer
joe twists something on the binoculars and pushes the lenses closer together to accommodate oscars small face
those were your grandmas
shed watch birds with those
oscar walks around the room examining various objects and clunks them against a lamp in the process
joe holds out his hand to retrieve the binoculars
why dont we put those away
oscar doesnt want to
joe raises an eyebrow
oscar shuffles back to his grampa and hands them over
why cant i play with them
because its not a toy
its a scientific instrument
you can play with them when im around to supervise
youre around now
im tired now
joe studies the binoculars for a moment and then sets them back on the shelf
rose shakes her head and hands norah another dish
well im not putting him in special ed
ill figure out a way to put him in private school before i do that
rose you buy generic cigarettes with couch change
how are you gonna pay for private school
whos going to private school
rose turns and sees her dad leaning in the door way
nobody dad were just talking
oscar get suspended again
yes thats it
the kids a little strange
thats against the law now
its not like hes out killing kittens or any damn thing
i swear everyones so damn uptight these days
oscar rides a mechanical horse
rose pushes a cart down the isle and dials her cell phone
she grabs a box of cereal and tosses it in her cart
mac sits at the table with a cup of coffee and reads the paper
a young girl holds out the telephone
mac its me
what are you doing calling here
i know im sorry
heather could have easily i thought she had yoga on saturdays
still its not cool
i know im sorry
i just needed to ask you
you know the other day
you said that
about the specialized cleaning guys making so much money
rose and oscar walk to the car with the groceries
the lorkowski family dines in style
are you even listening
norah turns to face rose at the other side of the table
what do you mean no thanks
what else do you have to do
you dont have a job
you dont go to school
what are you going to live with dad the rest of your life
i dont think youre in any position to feel superior
girls come on
lets have a nice dinner
its just until i get my real estate license
the staff sings a birthday song at a table nearby
i want to have my birthday at hinkles
the hell with hinkles im taking us to disney land
oscars eyes light up as he smiles at joe
i think disney land is a great idea
rose gives joe a sharp look
yeah whats wrong with disney land
and i think itd be great if you girls worked together
you are so out of touch
a large bellied superintendent leads rose and norah up a flight of stairs
beads of sweat drip from his doughy face
some sorta domestic disturbance kind of a deal
it was the lady who got the last word i guess
course shes in jail now so
heard one bullet completely shot off his ring finger
how long you gals been doin this kind a work
checking out rose you know mac pretty well
norah shoots rose a look
rose doesnt answer
they arrive at the door of the apartment
the super unlocks the door
just swing by the office when youre done and well settle up
rose and norah step into the apartment littered with dirty dishes and clothes
rose walks down the hall while norah examines a plastic bird with top hat
it tips down and drinks from the glass
norah and rose stand frozen at the threshold
they are awe struck by the horrible scene in front of them
blooms of splattered blood dry on tile walls
it gathers in sticky brown lines around grout
the mirror is broken
the shower curtain hangs half torn
think they loved each other
hands pull on yellow cleaning gloves
pinkish foam slides down norahs glove as she scrubs bloody grout with a toothbrush
metal shower rings clink against the metal bar as rose pulls down the shower curtain
a rag is wrung out in a bucket of reddish water
rose and norah clean in silence
reverent but detached
the way you would act at a strangers funeral
norah puts blood spattered towels into a washing machine
she spots a dish on the dryer filled with pennies and buttons and other odds and ends
she fishes out a pink candy heart
it reads luv u ever
norah pockets the candy
rose and norah gather their cleaning supplies and stand back to admire their handiwork
norah hangs back while the super hands rose a check
you gals did a real nice job
as rose turns to leave she flashes the check to norah
five hundred bucks
rose raises an eyebrow
joe walks though a low rent part of town carrying a barrel of fancy corn
he ducks into the neighborhood bar
joe enters a dingy little corner bar where everyones a regular
a couple of old guys slump over the bar
the bartender smiles
hey joe what you got for me
worlds finest corn snack
joe hands the canister to the bartender and sits down on a stool
the bartender pours him a beer
see where old millers house sold
a grizzled regular nearby looks over at joe
bet you could get a chunk of change for your place
you should cash out now before the market turns sour
joe shakes his head
im not selling my house
i dont care how much those idiots would shell out for it
i got history in that house
you think they understand about history
how much commission you get on that popcorn
bet you gotta sell a lot of corn to hey the corns good
not like the pet food but that was a phenomenon
the bartender sets a basket of cheddar popcorn in the space between joe and the grizzled regular
itll get there
takes time to get to know the market
develop a relationship with the buyers
but itll get there
who doesnt like popcorn for christs sake
my brother in laws in sales
the regular scoops up a handful of powdery orange popcorn
last year he buys a cow
why would you buy a cow
not a live cow
a whole butchered cow from a rancher
on the hoof they call it
joe looks at him with renewed interest
he sells off the parts of this cow to a bunch of restaurants
made a killing
the grizzled man licks orange powder from his fingers
whatd he do with the brains and intestines
joes wheels are turning
so he cuts out the middle man
not a bad idea
joe takes a drink of his beer while he mulls it over
course itd be smarter to do that with something that didnt have bad parts
another day in paradise
norah sleeps in her clothes and makeup from the previous night
knocking wakes her
though the door rose is on the phone
she says its important
with great effort norah picks up the receiver
what do you want
mac got us another gig
ill pick you up in an hour
roses nissan rolls down a rough looking albuquerque street toward a trailer park
rose sips her coffee
norah stares blank and blood shot
you still suck
apparently some crazy bag lady squatter person died and you didnt get me coffee
i didnt know you wanted any
of course i
norah shakes her head in frustration
rose turns into the trailer park heads past a row of trailers and parks
rose and norah get out of the car and approach a particularly run down trailer
how long is this gonna take
all we have to do is go in and throw everything away
rose and norah open the door and the rancid sweet smell of decayed flesh splashes them in the face
they lift their t shirts up over their noses and walk inside
old newspapers stacked to the ceiling
piles of trash lean like snowdrifts against the wall
cat food encrusted plates
norah opens the bedroom door and peeks in
she darts to another room and retches
great now were gonna have to clean that up too
rose walks into the bedroom blanches and stifles a gag reflex
norah storms past rose and out the door
rose chases after norah and grabs her arm
where are you going
there is no way
norah shakes off rose and walks down the row of trailers
you said you would help me
without turning maybe if youd gotten me a coffee
rose pulls her shirt off and wraps it around her head so that only her eyes are exposed
she strains to open a window thats been painted shut
she bangs and pulls but it doesnt budge
rose finds a can of beans and whacks them against the base of the window in an attempt to break the seal
rose grows more desperate with each failed effort
norah watches rose struggle with the window
pigeons gather at her feet and she gives a little kick
birdseed tumbles on to her shoe
a weathered man sits outside his small rectangular castle and tosses birdseed to the pigeons
im standing here
norah looks back up to rose still struggling with the window
finally rose muscles it open and throws norah an angry look of triumph
joe and oscar drive to a potential sale
norah ties a shirt around her face as she enters
they turn their attention to the discolored mattress attracting flies in the corner
what do we do with that
rose and norah lift the mattress and drag it to the door
rose and norah struggle to transport the stinking mattress to the dumpster
it is a clumsy process
the thing tips and falls on norah
tucked inside a mall the candy store does brisk business
pimple faced clerks ring up clumps of overweight families
oscar pretends to look at hard candies while he listens to joe and the manager
youre telling me this fancy corn stuff is some kind of health food
well its a candy
and a health food
yeah i dont know
we dont have much more shelf space
oscar spots a girl perusing wax lips
she looks to be about five or six
joe ignores the manager and reads ingredients off a twizzler package
what is that
i cant even read that
joe spins a can of fancy corn around and points to the ingredients
the manager leans close
high fructose no
the first thing listed
the number one ingredient
can you think of anything more wholesome
its all american for christs sake
the managers not buying it
oscar takes action
he positions himself next to the girl
do you know if they sell fancy corn here
the girl looks at him suspiciously
do you even know what fancy corn is
well do they sell it here
she looks back to the lips and tries to ignore oscar
i heard that the strawberry fancy corn gives you bionic strength
some kind of chemical in the strawberry flavoring
if you eat a whole lot of it it gives you bionic strength
the girl gives oscar a long stare
i dont believe you
i dont care if you do or not
the girl watches him for a moment and then walks over and tugs her mothers shirt
i read where these chemicals are getting into the streams making hermaphrodidic frogs
you think mothers want to expose their kids to that stuff
more and more people are looking for healthy alternatives which is why the demand for this product is so huge right now
like i said i already put in all the orders i want for this year
just then the girls mother walks up to the manager
do you carry something called fancy corn
joe looks at oscar
much progress has been made on the trailer
rose and norah work on the last remaining piles of trash
it seems wrong though doesnt it
to throw everything away
rose tosses a tattered fanny pack onto the heap in the garbage can
norah plucks it out and opens it
norah pulls out a photo id
she holds it up
the woman on the id looks street worn and crazy
i bet this is her
norah digs deeper into the fanny pack and pulls out a small packet wrapped in satin ribbon
norah unties the ribbon and finds a stack of old school photos
each photo is of a different grade
norah flips through the stack and the girl appears to grow up
wow look at this
norah holds the senior photo next to the id
the resemblance between the two is clear
think its her daughter
shouldnt we do something
try to find her or something
thats none of your business norah
rose picks up a bag stuffed with cans and fast food wrappers
she screams and drops the bag
a giant ball of maggots writhes at her feet
pointing hand me that
norah grabs the dust pan and hands it to rose
what if she doesnt know
wouldnt you want to know if this was mom
norah looks closely at the i
as rose deposits trash and maggots into the garbage bin
the comparison angers rose
mom was never like this
mom would never have been like this
norah thinks about that and looks back at the i
i wonder how she died
damnit norah we still have a lot of shit to do here
are you just gonna talk
joe and oscar roll a handcart strapped with fancy corn canisters through the parking lot to the car
that was real good
youre a natural
you got the timing you got the nerve
youre a real sharp cookie you know that
no im not
youre not stupid
what are you saying
youre not stupid
yes i am
they want to put me in retard classes
dont say that
its those teachers who are retarded
youre probably just too advanced for those classes
do you get bored in class
youre too smart
and those teachers just dont know how to handle you
youre probably a goddamn genius
you think so
i know so
weeds grow in the yard of the small house
norah empties the contents of the fanny pack onto her bed
she examines the photos and picks up what appears to be a senior photo
she turns it over and sees written on the back lynn wiseman
roses sentra is again parked next to the blue camry
same room as before
same curtains drawn
mac unzips roses skirt and kisses her neck
it was so disgusting
i mean the smell you would not believe
macs in the sex zone
he unbuttons his shirt and tunes out all those distracting words tumbling from roses mouth
rose animated slips her skirt off and tosses it aside
there were flies everywhere and really the smell
i cant even describe it
macs shoes hit the floor with a thud
he sets his belt and gun on the dresser
rose pulls her shirt over her head
mac kisses her belly
but after we finished
you woulda never even known
we took all that away
made it right
mac pulls off his pants
rose hangs her bra on the back of the chair and slips off her undies
i cant believe you
i mean i feel like i got you into this mess
her sense of pride wilts
her hand instinctively reaches up to massage the nicotine patch on her arm
no i listen im gonna pay for new real estate classes
rose looks at mac
well get you your license and then get you a little photo in the real estate section
you can drive people around all day and talk about
gosh what would you talk about
suddenly very serious crown molding
apparently its some private joke
oh yeah definitely talk about crown molding
the phrase seems to send a ripple of pleasure through mac
property easements square footage appliances
mac reacts to each word as if it were some filthy sex talk
he looks at rose and raises an eyebrow
youre holding out on me
rose rolls her eyes and laughs
she smiles and shakes her head
mac growls and pounces on rose
its fun and light
rose laughs while mac makes a show of mauling her neck
he falls on the bed and reaches out
rose takes his hand
its rough against hers
theres a circular indentation where his wedding ring isnt
rose stops laughing
she touches the invisible ring
whyd you pick her
mac looks up
the residue of a smile fades
you know it wasnt like that
how was it like
he takes a step back
are you going to do that
if this is going to get all heavy no
rose turns around and kisses mac
one of those soft teasing kisses that ends with a look that kicks things in gear
rose pulls her car up to one of many warehouses in the area and double checks the address on a scrap of paper
rose and norah enter this no frills operation
cinder block walls and concrete floors
a small tv on the front counter offers up a not so classic afternoon movie line up
as they approach the clerk drops out of sight behind the counter
rose leans over to see the clerk on his knees searching for something small and lost
winston crudely handsome with dark unkempt hair and full lips looks up
i spoke with you on the phone
im rose lorkowski
rose sticks out her right hand
winston stands to reveal he is missing his right arm
he clumsily shakes her hand with his left
so our situation is
on the tv a waitress enters the frame
she and norah both turn and look at the tv
the waitress pours coffee and exits the frame without a word
rose and norah turn back to winston
were doing some postmortem kind of um
specialized cleaning stuff and we had this really difficult
rose looks at norah and nods
really smelly job where the lady had died and they didnt find her for a while and it was really
the odor was really strong
rose smiles a little too enthusiastically
yeah a decomp
winston motions them to follow him through the store
he indicates points of interest with a flat monotone voice
general purpose cleaners extraction cleaners odor control
we carry both the winzyme and the dr
disinfectants stain removers and shampoos
winston contd steamers buffers foggers that kinda stuffs in there for rent or purchase
quick absorbing sawdust good for vomit
the tour ends at the back corner where respirators safety glasses gloves and tyvec coveralls crowd the shelves
and youve got your personal protective gear back here
the door beeps as it opens
carl swanson walks in wearing his above and beyond polo shirt
winston returns to the counter
carl grabs a case of disinfectant and sets it on the counter
winston pulls out some paperwork
you hear therere a couple of amateurs poaching jobs
winston shakes his head
rose and norah make their way to the counter with arms full of supplies and stand within earshot of carl and winston
bruce said they took a decomp for five hundred bucks
what do you wanna bet they threw all that shit right in the dumpster
norah nudges rose
carl pays and rose and norah watch him leave
they step up and set their supplies on the counter
as winston rings them up rose notices the shellacked puzzle picture of a big white cat on the wall
hey i have that puzzle
its a hard one
i think i got lost in the white and gave up
rose flashes a captain of the cheerleading squad smile
fifty eight twenty four
you like cats
winston looks squarely at rose and steps into the back room
you freaked him out
i asked him if he liked cats
winston returns with several books and pamphlets
hazmat guidelines biohazard recovery and disposal etc
bring these back
rose drives while norah scans one of the books
turns out its against the law to throw bio hazards in the dumpster
rose processes the visit
how perfect was he with the one arm
the creepy guy
do you think he was born like that
i didnt think he was creepy
dude he has one arm
they think were just a couple of hacks
we are a couple of hacks
norah looks out the window
i gotta thing
just drop me off here
rose looks confused but pulls over
norah opens the door and slides out
ill drop oscar by around seven
sarcastically you have class tonight
rose smiles uncomfortably
mortgage lenders and financing
norah shakes her head in disgust
heathers pregnant again
did you know that
hes never going to leave her
rose clenches her jaw and picks at a crack in the steering wheel
norah gets out of the car
god youre pathetic
norah slams the door and watches rose drive off
norah stands at the door well and scans the apartment number listings
she sees the name shes looking for lynn wiseman
just then lynn the woman from the photos opens the door and walks past
caught off guard norah follows her
they walk several blocks norah keeping a safe distance behind lynn
lynn opens the door to the building and disappears inside
lynn steps into an elevator
norah does too
the doors close
lynn slaps the stop elevator button
norah emits a small yelp
who are you
why are you following me
im not following you
you are following me
lynn freezes for a moment
it seems she isnt even breathing
her anger twists into fear
norah remains silent
lynn paces back and forth
this is not happening
norah is uncomfortable
lynn spins around to face norah
listen im sorry
i thought you were following me
thats all right
lynn steps closer
you think im crazy
no i dont
im not crazy
it was a mistake
no big deal
norah releases the stop button
its not moving
lets press the alarm button
norah presses the alarm button
theres a loud quick ring
they wait for something to happen
an awkward silence hangs in the air
norah gives it another quick punch for good measure
they look at the ceiling
they look at the floor
norah makes little noises
norah takes out her sign language book
she steals a quick sideways look at lynn before settling on the series of small illustrated hands before her
go to the university
lynn leans close and checks out the book
lynn sizes norah up
theres this gorilla who knows sign language and ive always thought that would have to be the most amazing thing ever
to actually talk to a gorilla
i think ive seen something on norah nods
yeah yeah with the kitten
norah offers a sad nod
it wasnt kokos fault
she was heartbroken
a knocking sound reverberates through the elevator
kind of weird dont you think
teaching a gorilla to talk
probably gorillas arent supposed to talk
thats whats so cool about it
lynn takes a long bold look at norah
the elevator moves
im sorry again about the
lynn lightly touches the crook of norahs arm
youve got nice veins
norah smiles self consciously
not a familiar sensation
the doors open to the albuquerque blood services
you should give blood
lynn steps off the elevator and grabs a white coat from a rack
she glances back with a smile just as the doors close
the house is dark except for a tv in the living room and a light in norahs bedroom window
norah pulls the photos from her bag and sets them on a shelf next to the candy heart
then she drops to the floor and pulls the lunch box from under her bed
she surveys the contents lipstick tipped cigarette butts an eyelash curler a blue jay feather an old photo
in the photo two girls twelve and five stand with their mom
a cigarette dangles from the mothers ruby red mouth
this time roses sentra sits alone
no blue camry in sight
rose lies in bed and listens to cars go by on the highway
she checks her watch picks up the phone and dials
could you tell me what time you have
rose hangs up and falls back onto the bed feet dangling off the edge
she stares at the ceiling and whispers
i am strong
i am powerful
i am a winner
pause im a fucking idiot
rose stands in the motels glass enclosed hallway watching the world go by
joe clears the dinner table while oscar occupies himself with markers construction paper and a creative impulse
rose walks in defeated
youre back early
im quitting real estate
what are you talking about
you cant quit real estate
youre gonna be great at real estate
you got the whole look and besides thats where everythings headed
hell its what i should have done forty years ago
rose sits at the table next to oscar
she looks miserable
oscar looks at his mom
want me to make you something happy
rose cant help but smile
id like that
make me something happy too
rose hands winston a canister of fancy corn and a business card
rays of the sun dart off the edges of the card in a style of a childs drawing
it reads sunshine cleaning
thought wed put a positive spin on things
my son drew the design
oscar stares at winstons empty sleeve
thats a nice job you did there
wheres your arm
thats all right
i was thinking maybe i could set a few out by the register
rose hands winston a stack of cards
he places them in an owl business card holder in front of several clean sweep business cards
this is great but you guys should really get out there and market yourselves
oscar plays with an extraction cleaner and accidently turns it on
winston gives him a nod that indicates that he should turn it off
funeral homes property managers
what you really want is to get in with the insurance companies
they can throw you a ton of work
oscar walks into the back room
the room is jammed with model planes cars and boats in various stages of construction
a hobbyists fantasy land
oscars mouth drops open
winston puffs up a bit with manly know how
do you guys have your b
blood born pathogens
the big money jobs
theyll expect you to be certified
i can register you for the next seminar if you want
rose norah oscar and joe follow sherm lawson across the car lot
rose shoots an irritated look to her dad
whispering to norah did you ask him to come
joe positions himself next to rose
quietly to rose now sherms gonna say hes against the wall but dont you believe him
theres always some wiggle room
i can handle it
the troop comes to a stop in front of a large blue van
i think youre gonna like this econoline
sherm opens the back doors
rose joe and sherm stick their heads inside
the girls have started up their own specialized cleaning business
crime scene and trauma clean up
its a real growth industry
sounds kinda gory
rose surveys the interior space
we gotta take any contaminated materials to the incinerators
so well need lots of space back here
for the bloody stuff
so how much is this
nineteen ninety nine
whats the play on that
oh thats the floor right there
im actually taking a loss on this to make room for some new product
well i could pay cash
cash is good
sherm walks around and unlocks the drivers side door
whispering to rose ask him about the bumper
the dented bumper
rose approaches sherm with a smile
i noticed the bumpers kind of banged up
we were over at motor mart on lomas earlier
they got a nice looking chevy g series for eighteen
oscar crawls into the passenger seat for a closer look
he sees the cb mounted on the ceiling and tugs norahs sleeve
god do people even use those anymore
what is it
sherm grabs the handset to demonstrate
its a cb
you talk into this thing and hold this thing down and it turns your voice into radio waves and sends it into the heavens
sherm tosses the keys to rose
why dont you take it for a test drive
rose norah and oscar pile into the van
joe hangs back with sherm
the econo van rumbles by
norah sits shotgun and sings the baseline to a s era porno
oscar kneels between them staring at the cb
bow chicka bow bow
can i drive
try the cb
rose reaches up and clicks the cb on
nothing but static
she adjusts the frequency dial until she lands on the faintest hint of a voice buried beneath the crush of static
oscars face lights up with amazement
rose is under whelmed
she clicks the cb off
antennas probably broke
norah points out the window
ice cream hut
rose pays for three soft serve cones and makes her way to the picnic table where norah and oscar wait
norah points to an apartment for rent sign on the building across the street
a big bosomed woman sits on the porch with a rabbit in her lap
how cool to live across from the ice cream hut
rose distributes the melty goods
you should rent it
seriously youre making money now
norah assesses the building
the rabbit lady sees them staring
rose and norah turn around amused
yeah well what about dad
oh please dad would survive just fine
you should do it
as norah thinks about a possible move glistening rivulets of chocolate ice cream drip down oscars cone over his hand and on to norahs leg
lick around the base
secure the perimeter
to rose dont you teach this kid anything
norah demonstrates proper technique
she extends her tongue out to the bottom edge of the dripping glob then twirls the cone to lick away the troublesome chocolate
its the gorilla girl
norah looks up to see lynn with a milk shake in hand
an involuntary smile breaks across norah
you never came to donate
lynn looks at rose
an awkward moment passes
rose smiles nods a hi
something familiar about the girl nags at rose
she searches to connect a face out of context
lynn eyes norah
we have snacks you know
had i known about the juice boxes
rose makes the connection her smile drops
lynn picks up on the tension between the two
well see you around
rose slaps norah with an accusing look
joe stands with sherm and waits for the girls to return
he looks at his watch
you still selling that luggage
that was a whole big mess
wasnt that it
joes smile disappears
yeah thats been a while now
dropped the luggage around the time your other lot when out of business
sherms smile dissolves
i could maybe drop it to nineteen even
joe holds out for more
and toss in some wiper fluid
rose norah and oscar walk back to the van
everyones slightly stickier
rose clenches her jaw
what the hell
i just wanted to give her the pictures
you took the pictures
why would you do that
we could get in a lot of trouble for that
relax i didnt give them to her
joe sits in his lazy boy as norah hauls a box from her room
its just three blocks away
its not like im never gonna see you
hey i think you should have done this a long time ago
joe strains to be cavalier but he cant look at norah
a marquee welcomes the conference attendees
rose sits on a folding chair and takes notes
the thirty or so people listening to the speaker appear to be mostly hospital staff and emt workers
a placard near the door reads seminar for blood borne pathogens
carl swanson leans forward from his chair and looks down the row to rose
lets take a quick break before we move on to potential pathogens suspended in excrement
rose stands by a display of medical waste pamphlets and munches on a sandwich
as she takes a bite carl walks up
foods better at the bar
holding out his hand carl swanson above and beyond
flustered rose brushes crumbs off her face and inadvertently deposits a blob of mustard on her cheek
they shake hands
rose swallow rose lorkowski
nice to meet you
i hear youre my new competition
were hardly competition for you
smiles im glad to see youre doing a little homework
a lot of people you know they think they can just jump in to this make lots of money
but they dont know what theyre doing
theyre not professional and that makes us all look bad
well were not like that
i just have to complete this seminar and were certified
youre not certified
probably by the end of the month
carl smiles dips a napkin in his cup of water and wipes the smudge of mustard from roses cheek
you had a
attendees file back to their chairs
i think its starting
sure i cant buy you a drink
rose and carl sit at the bar nursing drinks
if you spray the enzyme at that point itll just turn back to liquid which is a pain in the ass
the key is to bag it when its kind of jell o ee
that makes total sense
why didnt i think of that
you just figure all this shit out as you go
rose chews on her cocktail straw
its not how i thought itd be
i thought itd be gross
turns to carl
sometimes its gross
the maggots are gross
the maggots kind of freak me
the munching sound
and its so hard to kill the little fuckers
tell me about it
you pour industrial bleach right on em
carl offers a knowing nod
just roll their eyes and call you a pussy
rose laughs and takes another sip of her drink
the door to the bathroom is open
carl hums a happy tune in the shower
rose shimmies back into her clothes with an expression of self loathing
i am strong
i am powerful
rose drives and norah holds a long list of funeral homes and other establishments
theyre all crossed off
oscar sits bored in the back
whats a bastard
rose looks at norah with concern
jeremy said i was a bastard
what does that mean
rose has no idea how to respond
norah turns to face oscar
it just means your mom wasnt married when she had you
its no big deal
in a couple of years youre gonna find its a free pass to cool
youll probably start a band called bastard son
use it to impress the chicks
trust me the whole bastard thing
its working for you
oscar looks to rose and then back to norah
roses phone rings
she answers it relieved for the distraction hello sunshine cleaning
well im glad you liked the fancy corn
okay yeah yeah
rose grabs a pen hands it to norah and motions for her to write something down
rose hangs up
what was that
rose pulls the van up to the house and sees the old lady sitting out front
rose and norah exchange a look and then rose turns to oscar
stay in the van
you want a soda or anything
oscar shakes his head
we wont be long
as rose and norah get out and unload supplies the old lady stands to greet them
shes dressed up in the way old ladies are when they expect company
the woman nods
she is dazed with grief
were the cleaning service
i wanted to give you the keys
the old woman holds out a shaky hand
rose gently takes the keys
norah hangs back
in the sunroom
thats where my husband
i had bridge and
she blinks twice slowly then snaps back
do you need me to show you
i think we can find it
thats good then
rose and norah gather their things and head up the stairs
my son in laws coming to take me to lunch at the howard johnsons
they have such nice rolls there
rose hands norah the key and motions for her to go ahead
would you like to sit for a moment mrs
yes dear i think i would
rose sits down on the steps with mrs
davis and norah quietly enters the house
from the van oscar watches rose and the old woman sit side by side on the front step
roses hand rests lightly on the womans bony shoulder
words seem useless
norah looks around the room furnished modestly with a mixture of antiques and things that are simply old
yellow sticky notes cling to doors walls light switches etc
each note contains a simple instruction such as turn off light or watch news at
norah walks past family photos that line the hall
norah enters the red splattered room
a walker lies on its side next to a blood soaked rug
golden sunlight pours through the windows
a yellow square sticks to a picture frame on the coffee table
the frame holds the image of a smiling young couple in a different era
the note reads edna plays bridge at
norah slips a tyvec jumper on and looks out the window
a car pull up to the curb
norah stops and watches her sister walk mrs
davis to the car before starting her work
rose enters quietly in a fog
the stillness of grief is contagious
rose nods and picks up the photo of a younger mr and mrs davis
she then steps into her tyvec coveralls and zips up
rose holds oscar in her lap arms clasped tight around him
that lady seemed really sad
her husband died
oscar thinks about this a moment
so hes in heaven
maybe we could let her use our cb and she could talk to him
rose looks confused
oscar presses on
maybe he would hear her
doesnt seem like the moment to correct him
they ride the rest of the way home in silence
joes monte carlo sits out front
oscar and joe scratch game cards
i won a million dollars
let me see that
oscar hands the ticket over
you gotta get two hydrants with a matching amount
none of your fire hydrants match
oscar looks at the lucky dog card with defeat
and three zeros is a thousand dollars
you woulda won a thousand dollars but it doesnt match anything
what happens if it doesnt match anything
you toss it and try the next one
oscar moves on to his next ticket
he scratches the coating away and tentatively lifts his game card i think i won five hundred dollars
joe looks at the card
he looks at oscar and grins
im gonna buy a trampoline and a karaoke player and some chocolate honey dipped donuts
hold up there kiddo
thats not your money
thats my money
i scratched it
yes you did
you scratched the ticket that i bought
oscar follows his grampa over to the pay phone
and were not going to spend the money
were going to invest the money
joe plunks in some quarters dials waits while it rings
see thats the difference between a regular person and somebody with business acumen
thats a good word for you to know
a cu men
oscar nods and sips his coke
into the receiver bobby
joe lorkowski here
laughs i told you id call
pause yeah well i got the money and were in
but you gotta throw in twenty bags of ice
rose pays bills at the kitchen table
oscar bounces a super ball
were gonna make the money grow because thats the smart way
its capital and you dont spend that
you invest it
that way you can get the sp and have money left over
what are you talking about
oscar races out of the kitchen and then races back in with a pamphlet showcasing the amazingly sleek sp binoculars
he hands the pamphlet to rose
the binoculars that grampas gonna get me for my birthday
oscar contd theyve got an internal stabilizer thingy thats electronic so if youre in a speed boat or something it wont matter and
oh honey come here
rose pulls out a chair for oscar
oscar sits down and crosses his arms in front of himself
sometimes your grampa promises things that he really wants to happen
no hes really gonna get em
hes got a plan
if you say so
rose goes back to the bills
lynn wears a white coat
norah sits in one of the reclining chairs scattered about the room
you made it seem so fun
oh it is fun
would you like a refreshment
norah smiles and shakes her head
norah watches lynns hands push up her sleeve
lynn rubs iodine in expanding circles on the inside of norahs arm
lynn puts plastic gloves on and ties a tourniquet around norahs arm
she puts a rubber ball in norahs hand
can you squeeze that for me
norah squeezes the ball and lynn touches the plump vein
one more time
lynn takes the needle and draws it close to norahs arm
oh my god is that the needle
its a fucking cocktail straw
norah looks nervous
lynn smiles reassuringly
trust me im very good at this
norah squeezes lynn touches the soft blue stripe of blood beneath norahs skin and slides the needle into the vein
wasnt that fun
you might have oversold it
kind of twirl the ball around in your hand
it doesnt hurt does it
shakes her head feels hot
thats a good sign
norah self consciously nods and smiles
lynn turns and jostles the bag of blood
my friends having a thing tonight
lynn switches her attention from the blood back to norah
you wouldnt like it
i might like it
music and party goers spill from the student ghetto house
norah and lynn sit on a ratty couch in a crowded smoke filled room
next to them a flannel wearing burn out rocks to headphones
norah wears a candy necklace
debauchery plays out around them
i knew you wouldnt have any fun here
i am having fun
norah takes a tug on the joint and passes it to lynn
yeah no thanks
shakes head just kind of superstitious
norah nods and passes the joint across lynn to the burn out
the burn out tugs and passes it back to lynn
lynn waves it off a second time
im not mormon
youre gonna think its weird
sometimes i think that when you get high or drink or alter your consciousness like that you dont drink
lynn shakes her head
i think it weakens you psychically
like it creates these cracks and then bad things can seep in and maybe never go away
norah stares at lynn with great blood shot concentration
all right youre kind of freakin me out
you should just tell people youre mormon
i think your boyfriend is winning
two women gnaw at randys neck
his necklace is almost empty
yes he is
lynn lightly tugs on norahs candy necklace
she leans in close and takes a bite of the candy
norah catches her breath
lynn smiles pleased by norahs reaction
norah snaps back
i need more beer
norah pulls herself off the couch and starts for the keg
can i get you anything
norah offers a nervous smile
norah and randy lie on a thread bare couch
their bodies rock to the motion of sex
norahs thoughts are elsewhere
a small tv sits next to norahs growing collection of found trinkets
it spills blue light into the smoke tinged air
on the tv a reporter stands outside quicky lube
norah turns her attention to the tv while randy pumps and grinds
she grabs the remote
on tv tragedy today when an out of control driver crashed his car into a south side quicky lube killing one employee
what are you doing
norah turns up the volume
randy grinds to a halt
the driver of the automobile apparently suffered a heart attack at the wheel and is currently in critical condition
the phone rings
randy glares at norah
into phone yeah im watching it now
a van zooms past with a sunshine cleaning magnet on the door
randy steps out onto the porch where the big bosomed rabbit lady strokes her rabbit
he closes the door behind him
randy starts down the steps feeling dejected
you like rabbits
randy stops and turns
the large glass panel that made up the front of the store is shattered
shards dangle from red tipped edges
blood and glass mingle on the linoleum floor and plastic chairs
outside mac motions a stunned crowd to disperse
rose and norah walk confidently past mac into the lobby where a man wearing a quick lube shirt stands off to the side and cries
mac watches as rose goes back inside and greets the officer
the officer points to the shattered glass
nut job goes through the window there
he stops turns you guys are bbp certified right
legally its not really necessary
were in the process
you went to that thing
we adhere to all the proper procedures when dealing with a potentially hazardous situation
we are very professional
i thought you went to that thing
rose scans the area
are you guys all finished
its all yours
rose and norah slip into their tyvecs
why dont you grab the wet vac and ill start bagging the loose stuff
the officer walks past mac who continues to stare at rose
she looks beautiful and strong
rose and norah pull supplies from the van and ready themselves for the quicky lube job
i thought you went to the thing
i mean i went to part of it
most of it
what do you mean you went to part of it
it was a one day thing
i got side tracked
that above and beyond guy was there
we got talking shop and oh my god you humped carl
rose cant deny it
norah shakes her head
im already registered for the next one
joe and oscar sit in the car pulled off to the side of a lonely highway intersection
you got twenty bucks and you want three pizzas
they cost five dollars each and you have a coupon for two dollars off
joe contd you figure youll tip the delivery guy a couple bucks but the delivery guy turns out to be a lady
so you give her a crisp five
how much do you have left
joe assumes theres no way the kids getting this and turns his attention outside
a truck appear on the horizon
hey howd you come up with that
the truck slows down as it reaches the intersection pulls off the road and stops
joe gets out and walks over
oscar watches the trucker hop down from the cab and shake joes hand like theyre old friends
the trunk of the monte carlo brims with shrimp and ice
joe slams it closed climbs in the car and gives oscar a wink
the monte carlo slices through a vast empty landscape
joe beams with excitement
the thing is oscar
and this is important to learn early
life is sales
buying and selling
its the core of social interaction
and human beings are social beings
smoke starts to seep out from under the hood
joe eyes the temperature gauge
no no no no no
norah loads equipment into the van gets in and waits for rose to finish the transaction
a middle aged woman opens the door
im sorry i dont mean to bother you
i just wanted to let you know that were all finished up and the woman glares at rose
oh you want to get paid
we can come back later if thats better
the woman shakes her head and holds out a check
i cant believe i have to deal with this now
my son just died for christs sake
the woman looks away
im so sorry for your loss
rose starts to leave
turns for what you did
rose nods and continues on to the van
they ride down an albuquerque street in silence
you want a coke
rose fills a cup at the soda fountain
through the window she sees mac and family pull up on the other side of the store
mac gets out and pumps gas
the woman heather laughs with the little girl in the back seat
they look happy
roses fountain drink overflows
rose grabs for a napkin which clumps and tears
the door beeps
rose jumps behind the candy rack and peeks around
she turns and smacks into heather
heather glares at rose
you think i dont know
heather trembles with anger
rose stands frozen
you may have been hot shit in high school but what are you now
a waste of space
heather reaches out and gives rose a little push
ten years of anger culminating in this one anti climactic gesture
rose watches heather walk away and knows every word is true
a stream of water leaks from the trunk
joe gets out cursing under his breath
he kicks the car and a hub cap falls off
its an unbearable insult
stupid shit heap
fifty years of failures result in an explosion of frustration
joe stomps on the hub cap picks it up and throws it as far as he can
joe gathers himself and leans in the window
he forces a smile at oscar
oscar looks nervous
joe opens the trunk and checks on the shrimp
a car zooms by
joe tries to wave it down
another zooms by
come on come on come on come on
joe struggles to wave down a car
joe has an idea
make like youre crying
oscar turns on the tears
a car stops
rose walks in
oscar and joe feign casualness
joe looks at the bathroom door which stands open
inside the tub brims with shrimp and ice
what did you guys do today
rose turns to joe who shrugs
hows it without norah here
joe walks over and casually shuts the bathroom door
randy stuffs his face with a hotdog while norah glares annoyed
i know it was stupid
on so many levels
im really sorry
i swear it wont happen again
you werent around and
norah shakes her head
randy doesnt know what to say
listen randy i think we should stop hanging out
youre breaking up with me over the rabbit lady
norah doesnt respond
i dont know the way you act i didnt even think that youd care that much
yeah i dont
i should but i dont
and youre a really great guy
i dont care if you have sex with the rabbit lady
and i mean it seems like i should care about that
rose opens a stack of neglected mail
she is interrupted by a light knock on the door
rose peeks out the peep hole
rose hesitates then opens the door just a crack
what are you doing here
can we talk a minute
rose stands her ground for a moment before stepping outside
it was great seeing you last night
you looked so professional and confident
your own business
mac touches her lightly on the arm
hows the baby
mac looks away
i just wanted to congratulate you on the business
seems like things are really going great for you
rose and macs eyes meet
if we keep going at this rate i can hire a couple of employees soon put a little more in marketing give those clean sweep guys a run for their
im a business woman
nodding youre a business woman
norah stands disheveled six pack in hand
lynn opens the door wearing slippers
ever been trestling
shrimp jiggles in joes hand cart as he makes his way toward the row of upscale restaurants
a couple of upscale hipsters stare curiously at the hand cart as they pass joe
sounds of sex seep through thin walls
oscar sits up in bed
after a moment he crawls out of bed he grabs a flashlight from his shelf and exits his room
the mattress squeaks slightly as mac and rose have sex
in pajamas and bare feet oscar steps into the night
he flicks on the flashlight
norah leads lynn through a wooded area toward a train trestle
norah carries the two remaining beers of a six pack
are the bodies there
the person is gone
its weird cuz were connected to them in this strangely intimate way
but we never actually meet them
its just kind of weird
norah steps over a discarded tire
i have seen a dead body once though
lynn follows norah not knowing how to respond
norah tries to lighten things
she was in a movie of the week once ya know
a bunch of hollywood people were filming down in old town
they thought my mom was so beautiful and so talented that they gave her a speaking part
you want to hear it
i recommend the pecan pie
norah looks back at lynn for applause
i recommend the pecan pie
that was her line
it was on tv and everything
thats pretty cool
me and rose we didnt actually see it but rose says mom talked about it all the time
i dont remember
i dont remember her much at all
i have this box of her stuff though little things she touched
when it seems like she never even really existed
the two reach the bottom of a train trestle
this is where we climb
up to that girder
norah points to a rusted girder about eight feet from the underbelly of the track
im not climbing up there
best place to be when it comes
norah slips her hand through one of the plastic rings of the six pack and starts to climb
youre gonna miss the best part
i accept that
the two cans of beer dangle from norahs arm like a giant charm bracelet and clank against girders as she climbs
its like this big pissed off god up in your face just screaming at you
so close you can smell the metal on his breath
im telling you
norah wedges her butt into the belly of a beam and taps her fingers against the rusted girder
after a moment she leans out and looks down toward lynn
i didnt mean to bum you out with the whole mom stuff
i just thought you would
i dont know i guess i thought
the trestle starts to shake
the thunder gets louder
lynn covers her ears
norah pops open a beer and laughs as the train approaches
oscar walks along the sidewalk alone
he stops at the van opens the door and gets in
he looks very small in the drivers seat
he lifts the handset to the cb
what was i before i was born
what happens when we die
do animals go to the same place as we go after we die
is heaven really crowded
when somebody gets an arm chopped off does it go to heaven
is jesus another name for you or are you two separate people
were you born
will you die
if you already live in heaven where do you go when you die
the train careens above norah
sparks fly from the blur of wheels
the sky flashes between each of the cars
stars and grease and metal and night collide
norah closes her eyes
the sound of the train merges with the loud static of a cb
the sky is an electric blue
the kind that lives in memories and dreams
rose and norah play in a parked car
rose pretends to drive and smoke a cigarette while norah makes faces in the rearview mirror
rose gets out of the car and races toward the house
norah chases after
rose wait for me
a giggling rose stumbles in
the bathroom door is open slightly
she walks over peeks through the opening
theres a dress crumpled on the floor
a woman slumps motionless in the tub
her delicate hand hangs over the edge
scarlet fingerprints mar the white porcelain
norah enters the front door
she smiles unburdened by the knowledge
she runs towards rose
rose quickly pushes her back and closes the door
norah senses somethings wrong
she struggles to see whats behind the door but rose wont let go
the static mixes back into the roar of the train
the roar grows distant and is replaced by norahs laughter
still laughing norah takes a sip of her beer and sets it on a beam next to her
the beer falls
norah tries to catch it loses her balance and falls with a thud
lynn catches her breath
lynn runs over to find norah on her back eyes closed
norah opens her eyes and laughs
norah grabs the beer that she had been chasing
theres not much left but she downs the remainder
that was really stupid
i think i broke my hand
lynn leans close with real concern
but it hurts like a mother
lynn pops the top on the remaining beer and takes a huge gulp before handing it to norah
oscar walks down the sidewalk alone
his flashlight provides small circle of light on the cement in front of him
rose stands in her t shirt and undies
mac shuts the door
rose leans her head against the door and exhales deeply
she turns as if something is calling her
rose stands on tip toes and feels around on top of the refrigerator until she finds what shes looking for
rose sits down on the couch and lights her cigarette
the nicotine patch is still clearly visible on her arm
rose looks at the stack of unopened mail
something grabs her attention
an envelope bearing the return address of paula datzman mead
rose rips opens the envelope
rose stares at an invitation to paulas baby shower
a smile creeps across her face
the front door opens and oscar walks in
brow furrowed he walks past rose without acknowledging her
he goes straight to his room and shuts the door
a bottle of wine sits empty on a box next to two nearly empty styrofoam cups
hows the hand
norah shakes the last few drops from her cup and starts gnawing on the side
lynn takes norahs hand and examines it
lynn draws norahs hand close to her lips
looks at norah
norahs a deer in headlights
lynn kisses norahs hand
everything is still and tense
norah stares at her recently kissed hand and nods
she looks up to lynn
lynn kisses norah lightly on the lips
a tester kiss
norah doesnt move eyes locked on lynn
all is good
norah leans in and kisses lynns neck
lynns eyes are closed enjoying the moment
lynn opens her eyes
the school photos of lynn sit directly across from her on the shelf
lynn stares at the pictures
waves of recognition and confusion register in her eyes
norah kisses lynns neck oblivious
lynn pulls away
lynn tries to suss it out shakes her head looks at norah
how do you have my school pictures
i found them
i was gonna tell you
lynn shakes her head disbelieving
where would you find old pictures of me
we did this job a while back
lynn scans the other trinkets arranged neatly on the shelf
her eyes focus on the photo id
her face goes completely blank
norah bites her lip and nods
my mom is dead
a hazy mix of shame sadness and guilt seeps into the void
i wanted to tell you
that first day
thats why i you knew this whole time
you know i think theres a reason that i found them
because that lead me to you right
norah contd and i dont know exactly what went on between you and your mom
what the situation was
but it just seems like
you know of anybody i would understand
lynns hazy emotional mix has hardened into something sharp
she looks at norah with disgust
you would understand
lynn turns to leave
i lynn opens the door
norah reaches out but lynn stops her with an icy look
youre sick you know that
theres something wrong with you
lynn shuts the door and it feels like a slap
norah sinks down onto the couch
just norah now
the emptiness crowds around her
the afternoon sun beats against the weathered paint
the baby shower invitation looms large on the makeup table
rose wears a slip and unusually big hair
she grabs several outfits from her closet
the blue or the flowery
rose slips on the dress and sits to apply mascara
oscar shuffles out of the bedroom
roses cell phone rings
she picks up the phone while applying lipstick
over phone hello this is henry schmidt at state farm
pause state farm
over phone i spoke with you about a month ago
what can i do for you
over phone weve got a house we need to turn around and our regular guys are busy in santa fe today
thought id give you all a call
rose knocks over a bottle of nail polish remover as she grabs a pen and writes down the info
rose hangs up
shit shit shit
rose pulls on some panty hose and wrestles with her shoes
honey call grampa
rose grabs her purse
rose and oscar rush out
a baby shower gift sits forgotten by the door
norah cradles a phone to her ear and shoves clothes from a box into an old dresser
blow off the shower
rose drives the van and talks on her cell phone
oscar looks tiny in the passenger seat
i cant i
so tell him we cant do it
its an insurance company
they could throw us a ton of work
this is our in
so dont go to the damn baby shower
its not like you ever even liked paula
i promise ill come straight after the shower and help finish up
rose and oscar walk up to the house
rose tries the door but its locked
an uneasy tension shoots through her
she fumbles for her keys to unlock the door and is hit with a horrible familiar smell
oscar pinches his nose
stay out here
why do i too sternly because i said so
angry oscar sits down on the steps
the phone next to joes lazy boy is off the hook
rose walks briskly through the house
urgency mounts with each step
rose throws the bathroom door open in a panic
joe scoops rotten shrimp from the bathtub with an empty fancy corn canister and dumps them into a garbage can
rose recoils at the intense smell
im busy here
he tries to swing the door shut but rose stops it
damn it dad you scared me
sweat drips down joes face
he continues his labor and avoids looking at rose
those snotty restaurant fucks wouldnt buy my shrimp
some bullshit about health codes or whatever
i dont believe that shit for a second
god dad what were you he holds up a finger
dont start with me
pause bastards completely shut me out
they got their own little cartel
little restaurant mafia
i bet they screwed with my car too
i wouldnt put it past em
bunch of shady mother fuckers
rose leans against the door and watches her father
a wet slap punctuates each new deposit into the garbage
i need you to watch oscar
another load of slimy shrimp smacks the garbage
what do you mean you cant
i cant watch oscar today rose
im in a real bind here
yeah well its hard isnt it
raising a kid on your own
rose and oscar get out of the sentra and march toward the store
winston sees rose and oscar through the window and returns his attention to the model plane before him
rose and oscar enter
you look nice
winston finishes gluing the piece and looks up
i was wondering if oscar could hang out here for a little while
winston looks nervous
he looks at oscar
ive got this baby shower to go to and norahs working a job and my dads incapacitated
do you mind
i guess not
youre a lifesaver
you did your hair different
you like it
ill pick him up in a few hours when im done
oscar and winston are left on their own
winston forces a smile
oscar does not reciprocate
winston turns and walks to the back room
winston glues a tiny piece to the model plane
oscar inches his way over
this is a world war two mitchell cannon nose bomber
oscar leans in closer to examine all the tiny pieces
you make all these models
winston nods and points to a teeny plastic strut
dab the end of that in the glue
just a little bit
oscar carefully dabs the plastic piece in the puddle of glue and hands it to winston
whats that piece for
its a strut
with delicate precision winston attaches the piece
whats a strut
supports the wing
oscar examines one of the many completed models
seems like itd be hard to build models with just one hand
norah drives the van down a desert road
rose pulls the nissan in
she checks her lipstick in the rearview mirror before getting out and heading to the door
norah pulls supplies from the van and lugs them to the house
norah grabs a bottle of oj from the fridge checks the expiration and takes a slug
cat bowls sit in the corner
norah examines a snapshot on the fridge
a chubby middle aged woman surrounded by cats
the woman is bald and smiling
norah spots some incense
she holds a stick to her nose
norah lights the incense stick and sets it on the dresser next to a little statue of the laughing buddha
a collection of cat whiskers sits in the buddhas lap
evidence of death soils the bed
books crowd the night stand
living with breast cancer foods that fight cancer and coming to terms with death
norah rolls out plastic sheeting and prepares the room
the room titters with wannabe country clubbers
they nibble appetizers around a pastel tower of gifts
rose lifts a cheese puff to her mouth
shes flanked by paula and a mousey woman in a pink dress and matching pink pumps
so rose what are you doing
are you still cleaning houses
rose has gone into real estate
actually i own my own business
a real estate business
its a biohazard removal and crime scene clean up service
its a growth niche industry right now highly technical and competitive
what does that mean biohazard removal whatever
a lot of times when somebody dies it can be kind of you know messy
so we go in and clean up all that left over mess
make sure that the area is clean and sanitary
paula and mousy exchange a glance infused with disgust
people just dont understand the health and safety risks involved in disposing of biological material like blood and body fluids
oh my god
course we have a whole arsenal of disinfectants and um
like i said its a highly technical and professional operation with a whole complicated you know
methodology behind it
pleased with herself rose grabs another cheese puff
real growth industry
i cant imagine
you like doing it
she hadnt thought about whether she liked it
we come into the lives of people who have just experienced something so sad and profound
theyve lost somebody
the circumstances are different but thats the same
as rose talks her whole demeanor changes
that brittle self conscious edge dissipates
and we help them
in this one small way
rose is lost in her thoughts
something profound is shifting
sounds horrible to me
i believe id vomit
norah stuffs bedding in biohazard bags and wraps the mattress in plastic sheeting
a fan clanks at the window
norah struggles to get the wrapped mattress though the door
it tips and norah bangs her hand against the door frame
the incense falls from the dresser
norah finally muscles the mattress through the doorway
norah drags the mattress to the driveway
a wisp of smoke curls from the window behind her
as norah rubs her injured hand she hears the teeniest meow rise from the bushes
a little orange fluff ball at the base of some box hedges looks up with big startled eyes
oh my god youre the cutest thing ever
did you get left behind
the kitten answers with a pitiful raspy sound that passes for a meow
norah is powerless to resist
as norah leans down to pick up the kitten it darts from the bushes and heads toward the road
no no no
norah chases the frightened kitty across the street and disappears behind a house
after a moment norah emerges from behind the house
she coos at the small kitten cradled in her arms then looks up
an expression of horror and disbelief sweep over her
norah runs toward the house
a peppy woman with the enthusiasm of a game show contestant stands on a stool and waves her arms
for our first game weve taken five different kinds of candy bars and melted them in these diapers
oh i love this game
you all can somewhere a cell phone rings
the peppy woman stops and looks at rose
rose digs into her purse and pulls out the offending phone
she checks caller id
she cuts it off
rose forces a smile at peppy who motions for someone to start distributing the diapers
you can look smell and taste
the first to identify all five correctly wins
flames shoot up around the dresser and gobble a curtain
norah slaps a towel at the flames with one hand and holds a phone with the other
over the phone hello youve reached sunshine cleaning
youre call is very important to us so
norah snaps the phone shut and continues slapping back the flames
rose watches with a detached expression as floral clad women stick their noses in the brown goo of the diapers
it hits rose that she does not belong here
and for the first time she does not want to belong here
she turns to paula
you know what
actually theres somewhere i need to be
you cant leave now
were just starting the games
smiles and nods yeah
rose stands and weaves her way through the throng of stepford moms
relief sweeps across her face as she nears the door
rose drives as the sun sinks into the desert landscape
rose pulls up near the fire trucks and still smoldering house
rose steps from the car with an expression of horror
fear grips her as she scans the area for her sister
then she sees norah sitting in the van across the street
kitten curled up in her lap
rose marches over but norah doesnt notice her until she raps on the window
norah pulls off her headphones opens the door and slides out of the van
it was an accident
roses mouth slackens as her mind stumbles over the probable consequences of the scene before her
oh my god what have you done
it was an accident
how does this happen
how do you burn down a house norah
jesus fucking christ
jesus rose calm down
rose throws her keys at norah
norah turns to shield the kitten
the keys thump her arm
norah eyes her sister
so thats how its gonna be
well if you had been here to help me but no youre off desperately trying to impress stupid high school people who dont even matter
prove to your old cheerleading squad that youre not this huge loser
if you had been here doing your job it wouldnt have happened
so dont try to put all this on me
norahs denial of responsibility knocks the wind from rose
this is on you
you did this
you set a fucking house on fire
oh go ahead and play the martyr
its like your favorite thing
i cant believe i was so stupid to think that you could handle a little bit of responsibility
i am so sick of all your holier than thou bullshit
why dont you take a look at youre own life huh
youre a real inspiration
well maybe if i didnt have to take care of everybody in this family
im done being your excuse
norah filthy with soot turns and walks away from rose the fire and everything
the kitten clings to her shirt
oh thats great
turn everything to shit and then walk away
without turning or breaking her stride norah flips off rose
rose leans down and picks up her keys then turns and watches the firemen hose down the house
rose looking worse for wear tries to open the door but the store is closed and the door is locked
she bangs on the glass doors
winston walks from the back room and opens the door
long baby shower
im sorry i
rose is about to break
oscars asleep in back
norahs ruined everything
she burnt down a house
a clients house
carl told me
how does he
thats just great
we burnt down a clients house
how do you get around that
i figured wed wait and get the better rate once i got certified
didnt you go to that
rose doesnt respond
she slowly blinks and lets her new reality ooze over her
theres not a lot im really good at you know
winston looks at rose
im good at getting guys to want me
not date or marry me
but want me
ive always been good at that
winston looks away
i was pretty good at that too
cheering is good
not as marketable as youd think
smoke slinks from a cigarette on the makeshift ashtray
rose looks up to see oscar in his pjs one arm tucked in his shirt the sleeve dangling empty
rose musters a smile
you brush your teeth
oscar nods kisses her good night
rose watches him walk to his room and takes a drag from her cigarette
theres a knock at the door
rose looks through the peep hole and sees mac fidgeting outside
she takes a step from the door and freezes
mac knocks again
mac looks at the unresponsive door with irritation
he shifts his weight and jangles some change in his pocket
rose leans against the wall with eyes closed
she takes a breath opens her eyes then opens the door
mac smiles for the both of them
i was starting to think you were on a date or something
rose looks at him like hes speaking a foreign language
can i come in
its not really a good time
mac sags a bit
flexes an eyebrow
i got you something
mac pulls a small gold box from his pocket and presents it to rose
the top is engraved with her initials
its for your business cards
you put em in there and i dont know
he laughs at the silliness of the whole concept
rose stares at the small shiny box
it seems to make her sad
you dont like it
no i like it very much
rose looks up and mac senses something bad is coming his way
its just this thing were doing
come on lets not do that
but rose is resolute
she looks mac in the eye
i dont want this anymore
disbelief gives way to the unpleasant understanding
so thats it
rose gives an almost imperceptible nod
mac tries hard to ignore the rising slurry of hurt and anger
thats it then
mac hesitates hoping for a last minute reprieve
finally he nods and rose watches him walk away
norah steps off the elevator
people in white coats walk past her bump into her
norah spots lynn
lynn sees norah and looks away
is this your first time donating
norah turns to the guy in the white coat addressing her
he holds a clipboard
can i get your name
i need to talk to lynn
she cant donate
you cant donate
she points to a sign indicating how often people can donate
forty eight days
its not been forty eight days
why are you acting like this
why havent you called me back
listen i just dont think youre the kind of person i need to be hanging out with right now
whats that supposed to mean
do i really need to spell it out
norah stands stunned
she pulls the packet of photos out of her bag and holds them out to lynn
lynn takes the packet
as she walks back to the reclining blood donors she tosses the photos in a trash can
a smiling korean woman gives norah a cup of juice and puts an i gave blood today sticker on her chest
joe sits on a bench near the pond with his feet propped up on a canister of fancy corn
he reaches into the open canister next to him and pulls out a handful of gourmet corn
a few pieces land in his mouth the remainder he tosses to a flotilla of ducks
joe smiles as the greedy little bastards squabble over his offering
rose and oscar struggle to unload the super wet vac from the van
other equipment litters pavement around the van
winston records serial numbers onto a clipboard
im sure i can turn this stuff around pretty quick
are you coming to my party
rose looks from oscar to winston
were going to hinkles saturday for oscars birthday
itd be great if you came
sounds like a blast
rose smiles at the sincere enthusiasm in winstons voice
rose steps out of the shower and wraps her hair in a towel
as she walks past the mirror she plucks off the affirmation note and tosses it in the trash
rose oscar joe and winston sit in a carnival like restaurant
oscar opens a gift in the shape of a binocular case
he beams with anticipation
oscar snaps open the case and pulls out the old familiar pair of binoculars
rose looks disappointed
oscar looks confused
that other pair we looked at full of gadgets and gimmicks
joe contd they just didnt have the heft you want in a pair of lenses
joe points to the old binoculars
these here are the real deal
i want you to have them
rose shakes her head
its not like she didnt see this coming
dad you promised him those others
from the store
hes been talking about it for weeks
joe looks at rose with new found confidence
no rose i want to him to have these
winston eyes the binoculars
wow is that an old zeiss
joe nods full of pride
eight by thirty jenoptems
no marks on the objectives
winston looks at oscar
you got yourself some classic binoculars there
norah walks in
sorry im late
norah noogies oscar and drops a gift in front of him
to winston hey
norah kisses joe on the cheek and ignores rose
rose gets up
where are you going
rose walks to the bathroom
rose splashes water on her face
norah walks in and leans against the counter
rose makes no sign of acknowledgement
norah grabs some paper towel and holds it out for her sister
winston cleans up pretty good
rose isnt biting
she doesnt even look at norah
she leans past norah and gets her own paper towel
norah tries again
i read somewhere that beauty is really all about symmetry
like having eyes the same size and all that
pause so you know when you factor that in hes like hot
rose wont play
she dabs her face and ignores norah
norah walks to the door starts to leave then turns around
listen i know i fucked up okay
like really huge and i know that and im sorry okay
its a bullshit apology
more defensive than sincere
just the thing that pushes roses buttons
god that drives me crazy
that whole oh im sorry im just a big fuck up routine
like thats a legitimate excuse
norahs defensiveness loosens its grip
she steps towards rose
this is hard for her
sincerity is not her strong suit
i really am sorry
but it really isnt all my fault rose
i think theres something wrong with you
the way your brain works
i mean what the hell
its like you cant be trusted with anything
you just screw around all the time like its all a big fucking game
it wasnt a game norah
were not all just here for your amusement
you should have been paying attention
you should have been focused on the job
rose finally hears herself
its all the same old stuff
she grinds to a stop
she knows it wasnt all norahs fault
i should have been there
what are you going to do now
i got some ideas
i was thinking maybe we could norah shakes her head
ive got my own ideas
as they exit she turns to norah
so you really think hes hot
rose and norah return from the bathroom
joe eyeballs the girls in silent appraisal of the situation
you gonna open my present
oscar opens the package of fake tattoos
the guy said that if youre careful theyll last a whole month
and these arent stupid kiddie unicorns and shit
theyre all based on classic biker designs
oscar picks up one of the tattoos
whats that say
rose looks at norah
oscar slips his arm out of his sleeve and inside his shirt and stares at winston admiringly
rose whispers in oscars ear and he pulls his arm back into his sleeve
im thinking of taking a road trip
havent worked it all out yet
i was thinking i could maybe take the van
rose shakes her head
im selling the van
dont sell the van
cant afford the payment
just dont sell the van
rose forces a smile and examines her pizza
she cant watch her father cling to another impotent dream
just dont sell the van yet
oscar slowly retracts his arm again
with his remaining arm he lifts the binoculars to his face
rose tells me you make models
any money in that
the wait staff begins to sing a birthday song
rose quietly kisses oscars forehead and pulls up the covers
she turns and steals another look before shutting the door
rose sizes up her stack of unopened bills
she opens one sighs sets it aside
she moves on to the next one
the tv flickers blue light into the room
rose stops and looks at the tv
the phone wakes norah
she fumbles for the receiver
over the phone turn your tv on
channel sixty five
norah clicks on the tv and watches slack jawed as a waitress hands menus to two hard nosed detectives
one of the tv detecitves looks up and smiles
i recommend the pecan pie
norah focuses on the flicker light of the tv
as if in a dream rose watches the image of her mother disappear off screen
rose walks toward the van with a trash bag that swishes with each step
she takes one last look then peels the sunshine cleaning door magnet off and drops it into the trash bag
she crawls into the front seat and tosses empty pop cans and candy bar wrappers into the trash bag
a faint sound nags at her
she looks up to see the cb on
soft white static fills the van
rose sits a long moment before taking the handset
rose stops and looks around self consciously before resuming
oscar turned eight today
we had this whole big thing at hinkles
after dinner oscar and norah got a high score on centipede and put in ass as their initials and got in trouble by the manager
pause i dont know if youre in heaven or what
but youre not here and thats too bad for you cuz youve missed out
youve missed out on some really great stuff
rose pulls up in her sentra
the molly maid magnet is back on the door and shes in her molly maid uniform
she gets out and sees joe sitting on the steps to her house
theres something i wanted to talk to you about
rose pulls a vacuum cleaner from her car
well i was wondering if i could move in with you and oscar
just temporarily until i find a place
you lost the house
oh my god you lost the house
dad how could you lose the house
i didnt lose the house
i sold the house
theres this business opportunity not shrimp i hope
its not just some get rich quick scheme
and i got a partner who has experience
id learn from her
roses edge softens slightly
shes listening now
joe points to where the newly painted econo van is parked
in bold cursive lorkowski cleaning
underneath in smaller letters specializing in biohazard removal since
nineteen sixty three
dont make a big deal out of it
its a business lie not a real lie
i can live with that
and youd be the boss
with windows down norah drives across an open landscape
she glances at a wind battered map
a highlighted route cuts across the country
norah bobs her head to the radio sucks on a slurpee
she holds her arm out the window and lets her hand surf the wind
oscar in a catholic school uniform holds binoculars to his face
he watches a scrawny girl across the school yard
the girl ties a strand of hair to her pigtail then loops the invisible strand over a pencil
she glances over to oscar
oscar doesnt flinch
with school girl slight of hand the pigtail rises and falls
it is a magical flirtatious pigtail greeting
oscar lowers the binoculars and pulls his sleeve up to reveal the lil bastard tattoo
the girl smiles
norah walks down a corridor
the kitten clings to her
she turns the corner and walks though a set of doors to what looks to be a play room
blocks and brightly colored plastic toys litter the ground
sitting in the middle of the play area is an enormous black gorilla
she turns her massive head and looks at norah
captions i have a tooth ache
koko responds with thick hands
captions me too
the lorkowski cleaning van merges on the freeway interchange and spirals up the tangle of rust and turquoise ramps
