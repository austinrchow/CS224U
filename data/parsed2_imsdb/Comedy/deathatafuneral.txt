written by chris rock aeysha carr based on death at a funeral by dean craig music cue dont worry be happy by bobby mcferrin plays as we we pan across
a room filled with caskets
people somberly walk into a church
we see the signs outside of various funeral homes
we close in on a headstone that reads death at a funeral
asian pall bearers carry a coffin into a church
we push in on another headstone that reads starring chris rock
as we push through the cemetery we see various co stars names chiseled on headstones
we see a fleet of hearses driving through a cemetery
we see a florist making a funeral arrangement
close up of another headstone that has the directors name chiseled on it
music cue the music fades out
tight shot on aaron chris rock thirties dressed in a black suit and tie
he looks straight ahead with a somber expression
the camera pulls back to reveal he is watching four undertakers including brian place a coffin on a raised platform
the living room has been prepared for the funeral service with several rows of chairs laid out
would you like to see
aaron nods his head yes as brian begins to open the coffin
aaron crosses to the coffin
theres a dramatic moment as aaron moves to the coffin and braces himself for what hes about to see
the coffin opens and aaron stares long and hard at the body
who is that
who is this man im looking at
cause its not my father
are you sure
are you asking me if im sure i know what my father looks like
people make mistakes in times of grief
man look at the damn body
brian peers into the coffin
we see its an asian man
the other undertakers look embarrassed
come on brian
you know what my father looks like
he used to take you to little league
im sorry man
i got a little nervous
this almost never happens
its happened before
you mean this is a normal thing
this isnt burger king
you cant just mess up my order
i think i know where he is
close up of the casket opening
people look confused
the man looking into the coffin speaks chinese with subtitles
thats not my father
see my dad in this coffin in an hour or youre going to take his place
the undertakers pick up the coffin and shuffle out awkwardly
ill get him man
you do that
my people my people my people
aaron enters the bedroom
his wife michelle also thirties attractive is putting on makeup with a thermometer hanging from her mouth
aaron stands looking dumbfounded
they brought the wrong body
can you believe that
muffled because of the wrong body
do they know where he is
they think so
theyre getting him now
the thermometer beeps and michelle removes it from her mouth
i told you not to use marshals
but no you wanted to keep it in the neighborhood
i know swartz costs a little more but at least they know where the bodies are
michelle writes something down on a piece of paper as aaron crosses the room and sits on the bed
you were right
please dont rub it in not today
ive got so much to worry about
michelle gets up and heads to the bathroom as aaron takes out some index cards and looks them over
dad insisted on having the funeral here moms crying all the time ryan didnt help with anything not like he ever does
plus my eulogy sucks
i cant wait until this day is over
oh come on honey
im sure its not that bad
if it is at least dads too dead to hear it
michelle exits the bathroom
honey its going to be fine
it doesnt matter what i write
all anybodys going to be thinking is why isnt ryan doing the eulogy
even im going to be thinking it
she holds him close
baby youre the oldest
you have to do the eulogy
besides i think youre just as good a writer as your brother
you just need to let someone read your book
its not ready to be read yet
im sure its fine
once the funerals over and everything dies aaron gives her a look
look once this is all over you know your moms thinking about selling the house so you know weve got to get out
aaron looks a little uncomfortable and heads to the bathroom
you called them right
silence from aaron in the next room
you put the down payment on the condo right
i said id take care of it and ill take care of it
michelle looks frustrated and crosses into the bathroom
aaron is at the mirror
you better because i cant live with your mother anymore
ive done my time now its time for your brother to take over
from now on its only christmas and birthdays for us
once we move we can concentrate on your writing and our baby
michelle gets down on her knees and starts unzipping aarons pants
aaron pulls back
hey hey hey
are you serious
we have to do this today
michelle is still on the ground
todays the last day of this cycle
can i at least find the body first
we see normans car speeding along the freeway
norman black slightly heavier and riddled with anxiety is driving
his friend derek an attractive white clean cut doctor rides in the passenger seat
i hate funerals
its all death death death
i dont think funerals are designed for anybody to really like
i dont want a regular funeral
when i die i want people to celebrate my life
death at a funeral not me
i want it to be the saddest day ever
i want the stock market to stop
schools to close
and no garbage pick up
derek starts to light a cigarette
you still smoke
you used to smoke
i used to piss my pants too but i stopped
the only thing i want black is my skin
at least open the window
derek opens the window very slightly
ive got enough problems of my own to deal with
i told you
about the rash
got to use condoms
on my hand
still got to use condoms
look at it
norman pulls up his sleeve and makes derek look at his wrist but he doesnt take a great deal of interest
thats not a rash
what is it
i dont know but it doesnt look right
norman continues to drive
derek continues to smoke
if you hate funerals so much why are you coming
you know why
come on man leave elaine alone
shes the one
so youre going to win her back over a dead body
if i have to
elaine very attractive and her boyfriend oscar white are driving along wearing funeral attire
oscar looks quite anxious as he keeps his eyes firmly on the road
are you okay
yeah just a little nervous
about seeing my dad
i just dont think ive ever been so openly hated by anyone before
he doesnt hate you
he just loved derek
that makes me feel much better
at least you know its not you so try not to get so nervous when hes around
i cant help it
he puts me on edge
i feel like i owe him money
hes going to be more
concerned that his brother in law just died
he wont be focused on you
anyway when i tell him were getting married hell have to accept you
elaine takes his hand
as they exchange a loving look oscar takes his eyes off the road for just a brief moment
suddenly theres a bump
and we see a bicyclist flying over oscars car
oscar screeches to a halt
they jump out of the car
oh my god
are you okay
the guy gets up
yeah im fine
are you sure
is anything broken
im so sorry
it was my fault
i ran a light
oscar starts hyperventilating
i could have killed you
what if you had cracked your head open
id have blood on my hands
elaine shakes him
oscar calm down
you heard the man he ran a light
come on lets get out of here before he wants to sue
she grabs him and pulls him into the car
the camera is close on michelles head which is moving back and forth
we pull back to reveal aaron
they are doing it standing up
whats taking you so long
i just started
you want this baby as much me
if i didnt want you to come you would have done it five minutes ago
do i have to do this today
the door opens and a housekeeper sticks her head in
whos picking up uncle russell
aaron and elaine quickly pull apart
as the housekeeper steps back out into the hall
oh shit uncle russell
aaron fixes his pants as he exits the room
normans cell phone rings
how are you
i need you to pick up uncle russell
hes always in a bad mood
its not a mood if hes always in it
its his personality
can you do it
ill do it
see you soon
norman hangs up irritated
we see normans car exiting the freeway
aaron and michelle are standing to the side as the undertakers place the coffin on the stand
brian nervously lifts the lid and aaron looks inside
so is this your father
come on man
you know thats my father
just trying to be professional
what up michelle
he closes the lid and all four undertakers quietly head off
aaron looks up and sees his mother cynthia has entered the room
cynthia is clearly drained and tired
she stares at the coffin
mom how are you feeling
there were so many things we wanted to do
we were going to go to china
you dont even like chinese food
thats not the point
i havent been feeling good
who knows how long im going to live without him
it happens all the time
one spouse goes and then the next
i mean it might be different if i had a grandchild to take my mind off of everything
cynthia i they all cross to the coffin
cuts michelle off come on mom
youll be fine
youve got your friends and family
cynthia aaron and michelle stand around the coffin
where is ryan
have you heard from him
hell be here soon
just seeing that boys face makes me feel better
ive missed him so much
she looks down at the coffin
aaron turns away frustrated
michelle gently touches the coffin
do you need anything cynthia
yeah you can get your hand off my husbands coffin
youre leaving smudge marks
michelle tries to wipe it off with her sleeve
music paper plane by m
elaine and oscar are walking up the stairs of a typical college apartment building
the music is coming from jeffs speakers
jeff dressed for the funeral sits at his desk
hes holding a pill bottle that says valium
yeah i found them
the ones in the valium bottle
ill get them to you this evening
cant do this afternoon
its your fault you left them here
ive got a funeral
my uncle died
no i havent taken any
i saw what they did to you
what are they anyway
the doorbell rings
ive gotta go my sisters here
ill take them with me and stop by after the funeral
the doorbell rings again
jeff stands up and we see that hes only half dressed for the funeral
he doesnt have any pants on
he puts the bottle on the counter then crosses to the door and lets elaine and oscar inside
hey whats up
do you always open the door half naked
come on jeff
were going to be late
ive just got to put my pants on and im ready
oscar is still a little shaky
is he okay
oscars freaked out
a guy on a bike ran into the car
it came out of nowhere
i didnt see him
its okay baby
then to jeff go put your damn pants on
jeff heads off to the bathroom and closes the door
elaine spots the bottle of valium on the table and picks it up
itll calm you down
what is it
its just valium
gets a glass of water i used to take them all the time
itll make you feel better promise
are you sure
i mean ive got to drive
itll be okay
ill drive honey
come on open wide
she pops the pill in his mouth and hands him some water
jeff returns wearing pants
lets do it
oscar and elaine leave jeff surreptitiously picks up the valium bottle puts it in his pocket then follows them out
camera is in the entry way now shooting outside
a town car exits leaving ryan in front of the house
ryan aarons younger brother is taller more confident and more successful
he moves slowly towards camera and through the front doorway as camera pulls back with him
michelle aaron and cynthia are on the couch as ryan enters the living room
cynthia runs over to ryan and flings her arms around him
aaron looks a bit lost in the background with michelle but they walk over
i know this is hard mom
but youre going to be okay
you always know exactly what to say ryan
im so glad youre here
im always here for you mom
i guess if people died every week wed see you all the time
ryan turns to aaron and michelle
aaron how are you
how was the flight
i had to buy the seat next to me because i dont trust the airlines with my bags
and there was a lot of turbulence
i guess thats the thing about flying first class
it doesnt matter how much you pay if the plane crashes you still end up dead uh
ryan realizes what hes said and stops speaking abruptly
its too much for cynthia who rushes upstairs
end up dead
ill make sure shes okay
michelle heads off upstairs
we see normans car turn into lakeview retirement community
he drives past the sign and through a gate
norman is driving behind three old ladies on mobile chairs
hes honking at them
he finally sees uncle russell
there he is
you didnt tell me the guy was in a wheelchair
uncle russell an elderly man in a wheelchair sits in his chair
norman drives forward and stops alongside the old man
he rolls down his window and speaks very slowly with a huge smile on his face
hello uncle russell
how are you
were here to take you to the funeral
where the fuck have you been you fat bastard
if you took any longer id be dead too
the fake smile falls off normans face
ryan sees the coffin and slowly heads over with aaron trailing behind
he stands over the coffin
it finally registers that his dad is actually in there
its hard to see dad like this
but hes in a better place now
when does dead beat sick
i guess youre right
this is why i try not to get close to people
theres too much emotion involved
well that explains why you never call
what do you want me to say
some families talk to each other all the time some just see each other at funerals
i guess it is
ryan takes a seat in one of the chairs flanking the coffin
aaron sits as well
by the way im going to need that money
the money for all this
youre supposed to pay half
what about the insurance
thats moms money
what about the pension
thats moms money
so were spliting the cost
i dont have it right now
what do you mean you dont have it
you just bought a first class seat for your bag
and thats why i dont have any cash
elaine is now driving oscar is sitting in the passenger seat looking a little spaced out with jeff in the back
jeff leans forward
so poor old uncle eddie
but he was sick for so long
hes much better off now
since when does dead beat sick
shut up jeff
jeff turns his attention to oscar
i love when you come to family functions oscar
because then dad focuses all his hate on you
theres no response from oscar
he looks distantly out the window
the pills are starting to kick in
was there a dog in here just now
elaine looks at oscar very strangely
what the hell are you talking about
oscar falls silent and just goes back to looking out the window
uncle russell is asleep in the back
norman is looking for a parking space but the street and long driveway are packed with cars
a catering truck and flower van are taking up a lot of space
theres nowhere to park
then the small flower delivery van pulls out
derek points out the newly empty space
that truck is pulling out
just as hes about to drive in another car takes it
what the hell
norman gets out of the car
the other car contains jeff oscar and elaine
jeff gets out first followed by elaine
elaine i was going to park there
are you family norman
well no but im like family
no such thing
derek leans out the window
what are you doing here
your father invited me
she grabs oscar and heads to the house followed by jeff
norman gets back into his car
uncle russell stirs
did you see that
she totally blew me off
the flower delivery van has been waiting to move forward
its driver beeps the horn
i said whats happening
are we there
norman turns around and looks at uncle russell
i have uncle russell
how could i forget about uncle russell
derek has other concerns and the van beeps again
to the van yeah alright
what the hell is going on
uncle russell pokes norman with his cane
barely even looked
norman now highly irritated is forced to drive backwards
oscar elaine and jeff are walking to the house as other people arrive
its very green here isnt it
elaine takes oscar to the side
oscar are you alright
what do you mean
all this talking about phantom dogs and things being green
whats going on
what are you talking about
never been greener
oscar wanders off leaving elaine with jeff
elaine whats wrong with oscar
i dont know
somethings not right
angle on oscar as he wanders around the yard
i think its the valium
i gave him a valium at your place
i think hes just not used to it
jeffs face reveals his realization of whats happened
he walks off leaving elaine watching oscar
normans car is almost at the corner still being forced backwards by the flower van
we see that derek is still lost in his own thoughts
uncle russell is poking at norman with his cane
youre going the wrong way
stop the car norman
stop the car
i have to speak with her
i have to speak with elaine
norman reluctantly stops the car
derek gets out
what about uncle russell
i need help with uncle russell
its too late
derek is gone
the van in front of norman honks the horn
whats going on here
where are we
were going to be late
russell hits him on the arm with his cane
can you please stop doing that
the van keeps beeping
norman backs up
ryan is standing with aaron
they greet the mourners
nice to see you again
the mourner shakes hands with ryan then walks away
who are all these people
i dont even recognize half of them
its your family
you dont recognize them from the last funeral
ryan looks around the room
so what side of the family is he on
the guy in the leather jacket
ryan looks around the room and sees a four foot six man frank approaching the coffin
i have no idea
maybe a friend of dads from work or something
aaron turns to ryan
so youre telling me im going to have to pay for the whole funeral
no im telling you youll have the money in a few months when i get my advance
im not a god damn credit agency
reverend davis a very calm serene woman suddenly appears
aaron how are you
were just waiting for everyone to arrive then we can get going
i know youre in a hurry
yes i have two more funerals and a christening
i dont know what it is about the spring but theyre either coming in or going out
she laughs but aaron and ryan just look at her
reverend davis stands there waiting to be introduced to ryan
have you met my brother ryan
ah the writer of course
i must admit i squeezed this job in because i wanted to meet you
im reading mamas secret right now
dont tell anybody im not supposed to be reading that kind of stuff
im sure the lord will forgive you
aaron is irritated
you must be very proud of your big brother
he really made something of his life
i cant wait to hear your eulogy
no no im doing the eulogy
aaron is the oldest
the reverend tries her best not to look disappointed
well ill just make sure have everything i need
she looks at the coffin and then at the bible in her hands
weve got a body and a bible
well im all set
she walks off
look i think you should do the eulogy
everyones expecting you to do it
no theyre not
youre the oldest
you should do it
look most of the people are here for dad but lets not kid ourselves
a lot of them are here to hear your eulogy
so imagine how surprised theyll be when they hear yours
ryan walks away
cynthia is helping prepare the food to go
michelle is in the background at the sink
duncan cynthias brother a middle aged doctor approaches
hows my little sister
im trying to hold it together duncan
he was a really good husband
my friends always told me about the crap their husbands put them through
i never had to deal with any of that
remember when uncle matt got that nanny pregnant
that was horrible
they dont make em like my edward anymore
a good husband and a great father to two healthy strong boys
michelle cringes in the background
ill make you a cup of coffee cynthia
coffee can do many things michelle but it cant bring back the dead
aaron finds a quiet place in the hallway and pulls out his notes
my father was an exceptional man
my father was an exceptional man
my father was an exceptional man
michelle approaches him
honey we still need to finish that thing
remember today is the last day
can we talk about this when theres a little less death in the air
no we cant
honey im just not in the mood
i dont have any panties on
you dont have any panties on
its my fathers funeral
im just trying to help you out
ill put them back on before the service starts
now come on
aaron looks around the corner into the living room and sees the four foot six man standing by a table
aaron stops michelle
babe dont make it obvious but that guy in the leather jacket standing by the wall
michelle catches a glimpse of the guy
do you recognize him
isnt that the guy from the home depot
no i dont think so
did he put in the cable
no no thats not it
he keeps looking at me
hes probably just a friend of your fathers
ill meet you in the garage
we have a few minutes before uncle russell gets here
michelle walks off
aaron peeks around the corner again and makes eye contact with the four foot six inch man who seems to be staring straight at him
aaron averts his eyes and heads off
norman parks the car and gets out
he goes to the trunk and removes the wheelchair
what are you doing
be careful with that
uncle russell bangs his cane on the floor impatiently
hurry up were late
norman slams the trunk closed
aaron tries to get across the room as michelle heads into the kitchen
ryan stops aaron
oh ryan can you keep an eye out god damn that martina has grown up
angle on martina nineteen and attractive
are you talking about little martina
she was like a teenager when i left and now shes
shes like damn
aaron looks distastefully at his brother
can you keep an eye out for uncle russell
i think i should go see how shes been
yeah why dont you do that
see if she wants a juice box
ryan heads off towards martina
aaron continues across the room
aaron turns and finds himself cornered by frank
i was really sorry to hear about your dad
he talked about you a lot
i saw your wedding pictures
your wifes dress was very beautiful
aaron is a little uncomfortable
did he ever mention me
frank steps forward and holds out his hand
aaron shakes it
i dont think so no
were you a friend of his
something like that yeah
michelle sticks her head out of the kitchen
can i see you for a moment
well nice to meet you
thanks for coming
aaron walks away leaving frank alone
wide shot norman struggles to push uncle russell up a hill
come on put your back into it
youre supposed to be a young man
dont you have any strength
aaron has almost made it across the room when he is intercepted by reverend davis
i think we should get started
really have to leave at three
can we just wait five minutes for my uncle russell
we cant start without him
elaine and jeff are talking to some mourners
its so nice to see you
im so sorry to hear about your uncle
but hes in a better place now
i hear ryan is doing the eulogy
oscar carrying a leaf interrupts the conversation
isnt it beautiful
he wanders off again
elaine doesnt know what the hell is going on
elaine can i speak to you for a minute
to the mourner ill see you inside
jeff takes elaines arm with some urgency and moves off to the side
what is it
i have to tell you something and im warning you in advance youre not going to like it
elaine looks at jeff concerned
aaron is intercepted again by duncan who is talking to ryan
how are we doing on time
as soon as uncle russell gets here well be ready to start
so whats this i hear about ryan not doing the eulogy
i was just telling him how much im looking forward to hearing your eulogy
thats a shame
i mean im sure youll be good aaron
its just with ryan being the writer of the family
there are people here that dont even know your father
they just came to hear ryan
would you excuse me
aaron walks away
so any new books coming out
i just finished black hurt
aaron closes the door behind him
michelle is waiting
they start kissing and pulling at each others clothes
aaron stops and leans on the door and sighs
are you alright
every single person wants ryan to do the eulogy
he was my father too
im supposed to do the damn eulogy
im the oldest
where was ryan when i was taking care of dad
forget about everyone
youre going to do the eulogy and its going to be the best eulogy anyones every heard
now could you please do me a favor and get me pregnant

what do you want
you want me to talk dirty
im gonna suck it
im gonna to suck it
before michelle can continue her pg rated dirty talk there is a knock on the door
is there more soda in here
michelle is frustrated
elaine is looking at jeff in absolute shock
what do you mean its not valium
i mean what you thought was valium wasnt actually valium
its a hallucinogenic
like acid mescaline
oscar moves in the background behind elaine and jeff
elaine looks at him
hes making strange contorted expressions with his face and pointing at the sky
other people are starting to notice him and think hes slightly odd
this isnt funny jeff
im not being funny
look at him hes high as a kite
oscar sticks his head into a huge bush
what the hell are you doing leaving that stuff around your house
a friend left it
and who the hell just goes into someones house and takes pills
i thought they were valium
takes a deep breath what am i supposed to do
should i tell him
no dont do that
itll just freak him out
well just keep a close eye on him and make sure he doesnt get out of control
and dont let him spend too long talking to one person
oscar wanders into the front door
elaine quickly follows him
jeff reluctantly follows elaine
derek arrives in time to see this and follows as well
oscar wanders in followed by elaine and jeff
duncan sees them enter and approaches them
how are you
she gives him a kiss
not bad considering were at a funeral
jeff steps forward
he shakes his hand
hows pepperdine treating you
is professor clarke still giving you a hard time
its all worked out
im not worried about you
duncan looks pointedly at elaine irritating her
duncan looks at oscar who is in the background
so i see you brought your friend
hes my boyfriend
and you know his name
doctor how nice to see you again
how are you doing at the hospital
we should have lunch soon
id love to hear what you think about the new pediatric wing at cedars
maybe elaine would like to join us for lunch
they both look expectantly at elaine who looks away disgusted
cynthia comes up to them and kisses elaine and jeff hello
oscar stares at her
good to see you
im so sorry auntie
were going to miss uncle edward so much
he was a great guy
oscar this is my aunt oscar grabs cynthia in a tight hug
im so sorry about
he sings amazing grace softly as duncan derek jeff and elaine look on
amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me
cynthia untangles herself from oscar
she heads back outside
duncan gives elaine a look then heads off after cynthia
what are you going to do
i dont know
i cant leave
aunt cynthia would never speak to me again
jeff notices that oscar has left
he rushes outside
derek follows suit
we see oscar emerging from the front doorway followed by jeff
then comes elaine
jeff approaches oscar and stands with him as elaine watches from the doorway
derek walks up
you look nice elaine
im dressed for a funeral
yeah but you make death look sexy
she looks at him
so i heard about the engagement
i dont really have time to deal with whatever happened between you and me
but i have not told my dad yet so i would appreciate it if you would keep your mouth shut
anything for you
derek looks over and notices oscar looking bewildered
so thats him
thats the man youre going to spend the rest of your life with
elaine looks over at the drugged up oscar
oscar leans over like hes on a nod
jeff leans down with him watching
right before oscar falls over he comes up really fast
then he starts walking
yep thats him
oscar who has been walking in circles with a look of awe on his face changes direction and flies by elaine and derek back into the house with jeff in
i elaine follows the guys leaving derek behind
aaron is straightening his tie and practicing his eulogy
my father was an exceptional man
my father was frank again approaches aaron
actually theres something id like to talk to you about
when you have a minute
aaron hears uncle russell in the background
yeah thats great
do you mind if we do it later though
my uncle just got here
aaron heads off
norman pushes russell up the stairs close to where derek is standing
he looks like hes about to collapse from exhaustion
norman lets go of the wheelchair and catches his breath
derek grabs the chair blocking norman from view just as aaron arrives
thank you derek youre a life saver
hope it wasnt too much trouble
no problem at all
aaron wheels uncle russell inside
how are you doing uncle russell
derek follows leaving norman standing there out of breath
can i get a little help
aaron enters and nods to reverend davis who stands at the front
ladies and gentlemen could you all kindly take your seats
were about to begin the service
ryan helps martina to her seat
jeff keeps an eye on oscar
elaine grabs oscar and drags him to a seat
aaron wheels uncle russell to his place
he pokes people with his cane
aaron then takes his seat with michelle
oscar is not looking so good
ryan finally ends the conversation with martina and heads to his seat
reverend davis is about to start but waits as norman sweating pushes through the crowd to his seat
the reverend waits for the disturbance to end so norman attracts the attention of everyone
norman takes his seat next to derek
derek leans away
family and friends were gathered here today to mourn the passing of edward barnes
yeah well you left me to push uncle russell up that damn hill all by myself
then took all the credit
elaine turns around
norman shut up
elaine turns back around
norman is irritated by this
id like to start with a favorite passage of edwards from first samuel chapter verses in the king james bible
and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking unto saul that the soul of jonathan was knit with the soul of david and jonathan loved
him as his own soul
and saul took him that day and would let him go no more home to his fathers house
while the reverend is talking norman pokes elaine on the shoulder and leans forward
hey elaine i know you dont think im part of the family cause youre not
but when you dissed me back there i had uncle russell in the car
aaron disturbed by normans whispering looks over
you stole my parking space and i had to push him half a mile up a hill
we almost missed the service
aaronlooks over again
look norman if you poke me one more time im going to kick your ass
what the hell is going on
she stole my parking space
whispers to norman stole your parking space
my fathers dead
reverend davis looks at them then continues her speech
then jonathan and david made a covenant because he loved him as his own soul
as she speaks norman looks at his wrist worried
the woman sitting next to him smacks his wrist down
angle on elaine looks at jeff who watches oscar
oscar is fidgeting and looking worried
angle on aaron and michelle
aaron looks worried
and jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him and gave it to david and his garments even to his sword and to his bow and to his
angle on oscar is laughing
elaine tries to control him
and now well have a few words from edwards son aaron
ryans older brother
angle on aaron as he gathers himself
michelle gives aaron a supportive squeeze of the arm
aaron looks over and sees frank staring at him
angle on uncle russell
why isnt ryan doing the eulogy
this is bullshit
aaron arrives at the front and looks out across the expectant crowd
hes extremely nervous
good afternoon everyone
his voice cracks thank you for coming
i never realized dad was so popular
it looks like hes got more friends now that hes dead
blank faces stare back at aaron
cynthia looks pained
everyone is silent except for oscar who laughs loudly
elaine silences him with a look
aaron composes himself and pulls his notes out
my father was an exceptional man
he was born in
he grew up in alabama on a farm
he loved to take long walks in the woods with his close friend bobby
he told me how they spent their summer days riding their bikes through the fields and swimming in the lake
as aaron speaks reverend davis looks concerned because the eulogy is so bad
she looks to ryan who looks like what can i do
jeff looks more concerned with oscar whose face is contorted with pain
he looks like hes going to burst
angle on aaron
dads first job was working after school as an assistant to an electrician named mr
back then blacks werent allowed to wear rubber gloves
so my father got shocked a lot
because of that he had no feeling in his fingertips
i asked my dad what his first boss was like
the drugs have gotten the best of oscar
he suddenly grabs elaines arm
aaron keeps talking
did you just see that
the coffin just moved
im telling you i saw it move
aaron becomes vaguely aware of the disturbance but battles on with his eulogy
he said he was a nice man and surprisingly well dressed
when dad was eighteen he left home after an argument with his father
he never told me what that argument was about but i do know that after leaving south carolina sadly he and bob lost touch and never saw each other again
dad went to college where he studied accounting a decision which lead to a career in corporate finance
but his real passion was for the arts with a particular fondness for theatre dance and musicals
he was a charter member of the negro ensemble company and contributed regularly to the alvin ailey school of dance
oscars protests are getting louder
duncan looks back at the disruption with a disapproving glare
elaine looks at jeff who watches concerned
it happened again
oscar please people start looking at oscar whos becoming increasingly vocal and looking increasingly like someone on acid
that coffins moving
just calm down
aaron looks over to oscar
the coffins moving
michelle looks worried
cynthia watches silently
oscar jumps up
aaron stops the eulogy
elaine is about to die from embarrassment
theres someone alive in there
oscar please sit down
oscar ignores her and walks purposefully towards the coffin
people watch him in astonishment including jeff
what the hell is wrong with you people
oscar approaches the coffin as aaron steps off the dais
elaine tries to hold oscar back but she cant
oscar where are you going
what are you doing
theres someone moving in there
cant you see
oscar tries to open the coffin
aaron and elaine try to restrain him but cant
a tussle begins
ryan jumps in to help
what the hell is wrong with you
elaine attempts to grab ryan
duncan stands up and tries to help
get away from there
no i have to show you
the scene descends into absolute chaos with people pushing and struggling
finally the coffin falls off the platform and tips over
the dead body of edward rolls out onto the floor at the feet of cynthia
aaron freezes in shock
michelle takes cynthia through the kitchen
the living room is left in chaos
elaine drags oscar out the back
cynthia in tears enters accompanied by aaron michelle and reverend davis
its alright cynthia
she sits in a chair crying uncontrollably
aaron is so angry he just marches out
some men grab the body and put it back in the coffin
aaron comes out of the kitchen and heads to the back yard
as they put the coffin back on the stand ryan addresses the crowd
please let me extend my apologies to you all
i understand the incident you just witnessed was quite shocking but everything will be
to its proper place
please enjoy the refreshments and well call you when were ready to continue
it wouldnt have happened if ryan had done the eulogy
aaron exits through the garden door
aaron storms out to elaine who is trying to comfort oscar
hes looking very disturbed
jeff is also there looking guilty
elaine what the hell was that
im so sorry aaron
my dead fathers sprawled out on the living room floor but its okay youre sorry
but the coffin was moving
go back inside
ill explain later
an annoyed and confused aaron turns and walks back to the house
hes almost to the door when michelle arrives
no i havent made the call about the down payment yet
i wasnt going to say that
no im not going to have sex with you
i wasnt going to say that
what were you going to say
he goes inside leaving michelle standing there
duncan comes out and heads for oscar
ill kill him
elaine tries to keep duncan away from oscar who is stressed enough and looks terrified
dad leave it alone
leave it alone
he just knocked my brother in law out of his coffin
it wasnt his fault
yes it was
my sister is in tears
i cant believe you brought this idiot
i dont ever want to see him again do you understand me
i cant do that
moving in together
duncan looks over at oscar who looks like hes just seen a ghost
hes struggling to stand up straight with jeff whos doing his best to look after him
are you crazy
dad this isnt actually what hes like
he took some drugs and drugs
is he on the pipe
jeff looks over his eyes pleading with elaine not to tell on him
no hes not on the pipe
he took some valium and had a
jeff looks grateful
thats not a valium high
your mother was on valium for forty years
she never knocked over a coffin
i just want to point out that you wont see derek knocking over a coffin
not right now dad
ive got to check on cynthia but this isnt over
duncan walks back to the house
elaine walks over to oscar who is hugging a tree
come and sit down
aaron talks to a mourner
norman comes up and hugs him
are you alright
that was insane
he just fell out the coffin like a dead fish
i guess its not much of a metaphor when youre talking about a dead human but death at a funeral
aaron looks at norman
its just that you never know when its your time
like i have this weird thing on my wrist
ive had it for a few weeks now
i dont know what it is why dont you show it to my uncle duncan
hes a doctor
norman walks off toward the kitchen
he passes uncle russell and ryan talking to martina
i read your last book black hurt
thanks a lot
im not giving you a compliment you arrogant bastard
what a load of bullshit
i wouldnt wipe my ass with it
ryan leads martina away from uncle russell
oscar elaine and jeff are standing together
i swear it was moving
i must be losing my mind
looks at his hands why are my hands so big
oscar listen to me
i need to tell you something
elaine sits him down on the bench
what is it
you remember i gave you some valium earlier
well it turns out that it wasnt actually valium
oscar just looks at elaine
jeff slinks off into the background
can you hear me
cynthia is being comforted by her friends and duncan
norman enters and beckons duncan over to the side
hello doctor i know this is a bad time but ive got this thing on my hand
ive had it for weeks now
duncan is looking at norman incredulously
what do you think it is
cynthia stands up
duncan im going back now
reluctantly duncan answers norman
you should probably go see a dermatologist
he turns to follow his sister out but norman pulls him back
what do you think it is
i dont know
it looks like some kind of pigment mutation
duncan walks further out of the room
duncan turns again
youre probably just allergic to something
maybe from shellfish nuts
duncan heads further out of the room but norman wont give up
what kind of nuts
duncan turns around again
i dont know
duncan finally exits leaving norman looking shocked and terrified
a pigment mutation
elaine is trying to explain to oscar
do you understand
he turns to jeff
yeah now the best thing to do is relax and just go with the flow
try and enjoy it
oscar stands up panicked and grabs jeff by the lapels
we see the bottle of valium falls out of his pocket
she tries to pull him off jeff
how long does it last
i dont know
oscar let go
she pulls him off jeff
angle on derek watching from the window
im going to be sick
angle on derek smoothing his hair seeing his opportunity
angle on oscar runs inside
elaine follows with jeff in tow
they head into the house
derek has been looking at elaine outside and waiting for his moment
elaine comes rushing in following oscar
oh hi elaine
you following me
she just runs right past then jeff rushes past following elaine
oscar pushes through people
elaine grabs oscar and leads him to the stairs
hes going to be sick
they head up the stairs with jeff following
elaine rounds the corner and leads oscar to the bathroom
goes in and shuts the door behind him
oscar is building up quite a sweat and mumbling to himself
he catches his reflection in the mirror and screams
elaine opens the door
oscar grabs the hair dryer and wields it like a gun
oscar put down the dryer
get back or ill blow your head off
oscar backs elaine out of the bathroom
oscar please oscar shuts the door and locks it
elaine is pressed against the door
oscar are you okay
she tries to open the door but its locked
jeff walks up checking his pockets
oscar let me in
jeff realizes he lost the pill bottle
i cant find the pill bottle
but elaine is too busy to hear
open the door
jeff looks at the floor as he leaves
oscar is talking to himself in the mirror
its going to be okay
youre and investment banker
youve handled mergers for billion dollar companies
you can do this
dead bodies dont move
they dont move
but that body was moving
it was moving
then he slaps himself
snap out of it
you can handle this
you can do this
he runs the tap and splashes some water on his face
oscar is still staring at himself in the mirror
thats it oscar keep it together
keep it together
keep it together
everythings going to be fine
dead people dont move
they dont move do they
he screams at himself in the elaine has her ear pressed against the door
she hears the scream
we can do this
a few hours
i mean youve already been in here for
he looks at his watch
wheres my watch
he sees its on the other wrist
he checks the time
its already been
elaine continues to knock on the door
open the door
oscar finally gets a read on his watch
suddenly the pressure of
the situation overtakes him
as the screaming and cursing goes on upstairs aaron approaches a mourner who looks concerned
aaron turns around not knowing what to do
grief does strange things to people
aaron looks at him a little freaked out by his sudden appearance
i guess so
if you remember i have something to talk to you about
is there somewhere private we could go
they walk away
the screaming continues as jeff frantically but slowly comes down the stairs re tracing his steps and searching around for his lost bottle of pills
frank and aaron enter
frank looks around the room a little grief stricken himself
aaron walks to the desk as frank touches some mementoes he clearly remembers
frank takes out his glasses and notices a manuscript on the desk with aarons name
are you writing a novel
aaron takes the manuscript and moves it away
like your big brother
actually im the oldest
i was writing before
ive had a few pieces published in the new yorker
but now im mainly teaching
well you must be very proud of your brother then
getting all his novels published
aaron decides to move the conversation on
what did you want to talk about
he motions for frank to take a seat and sits across from him
your father and i were very
and we spent a lot of time together
yeah well dad was a fun guy
frank takes an envelope out of his inside jacket pocket and takes some photos from the envelope
ive got some photos i want to show you
frank passes the first photo
thats me and your dad in central park in new york
aaron looks at the photo curiously
thats us on santa monica boulevard on halloween
aaron takes the next one becoming more suspicious
so where did you and my dad meet
elaine is outside the bathroom banging on the door
we can still hear oscar moaning inside
are you alright
oscar is laying in the bathtub
he has his head under the faucet with his mouth open
a drip falls into his mouth
he smacks his lips together and then opens his mouth and waits for the next drop
aaron is sitting with frank
frank passes him another photo
thats one of me and your father going to the premiere of dreamgirls
i was dressed as deena and your father had to be effie
aaron looks at the photo of them dressed in drag
i mean you have all these pictures but he never said anything about you
this is the first im frank gives aaron a knowing look
how did you know my father
aaron looks around the room
there is a copy of people magazine sexiest men issue on the table
he sees figurines of male ballet dancers
its getting clearer
he sees three robert mapplethorpe photos on the wall
theres a signed kathy griffin x
frank looks around waiting for him to get it
aaron looks at a framed movie poster for australia with hugh jackman
aaron looks back at the picture
he gets it
aaron jumps up and closes the study door
are you really that shocked
frank gestures around the room
i had no idea
im sure he would have eventually told you but i guess he wasnt sure how youd react
aaron shakes in disgust
aaron gathers his senses
he has a thought and turns to frank
does my mother know
and theres no reason why she should
just as long as i get whats owed to me
a long pause
aaron looks over at frank
whats owed to you
well obviously i should get something
i mean your dad and i were lovers and he left me absolutely nothing in his will
how do you think that makes me feel
aaron fails to respond because hes in too much shock
ill tell you how it makes me feel cheap
like some cheap piece of ass
i mean im entitled to something
what do you want
what i want is a lot but im not asking you for what i want
i deserve thirty thousand dollars
thirty thousand dollars
i cant just give you thirty thousand dollars
my wife and i are trying to have kids your father told me you were having trouble
look your father promised to take care of me and i made sacrifices to keep him happy
aaron gets angry
you think you can come in here slander my fathers name and show me a few photos of you and my dad dressed up going to see dreamgirls
i saw dreamgirls twice
im not gay
thats not proof of anything
steppin to the bad side gonna take a mean ride
aaron grabs frank and pushes him against the wall
im not giving you anything but a frank pulls out another photo and holds it up to aarons face
aaron releases frank and snatches the picture
now i dont want to but i will show these photos to your mother
do you really want me to do that today
he exits the study
aaron closes the study door behind him and almost bumps into two male mourners
aaron i was just telling george here how when we were boys together your dad used to love to make us all go skinny dipping
aaron just stares at them
then he moves toward the living room
aaron crosses the living room which is full of people mingling around
hes gone pale
oh god oh god oh god
hes looking around for ryan but theres no sign
michelle watches aaron walk around the room
elaine is banging on the bathroom door
open the door
derek arrives behind her and leans in close
anything i can do to help
not really thanks
derek moves over to face her and leans his arm on the door very coolly
i guess youve got it under control
elaine ignores him and continues banging on the door
anguished noises emanate from the bathroom
open the door
so what are you doing after the funeral
ive got maxwell tickets
i dont have time for your shit
now get the hell away from me
derek looks hurt and storms off
ryan is talking to martina
so youve never been to new york
ive been with my parents once
oh thats not really seeing new york
you have to come visit me
whens your birthday
i turn eighteen next month
all star weekend is in new york this year
ryan i need to talk to you
not now aaron

aaron pulls him away
aaron pulls ryan into the garage and closes the door
what are you doing
what is it
aaron lowers his voice
that guy that was here before that we didnt recognize
the guy in the leather jacket
what about him
aaron lowers his voice further
well i was just with him in the study and
and he showed me some pictures
he showed you some picture
whats wrong with that
pictures of him and dad together at the premiere of dreamgirls
ryans face is blank
its not registering
look is this going anywhere aaron
ryan he was dads lover
no no no
the guy in the leather jacket just showed me pictures of him and dad together
no no no
i dont believe that
my father is not gay
ive known him my whole life
and hes the most non gay man ive ever met
matter fact hes so straight he makes me seem gay
and i know im not gay aaron pulls out the picture
norman and derek are sitting at the table
norman is looking at his wrist
how can she be more interested in that idiot than me
they dont know what they want
normans still examining his arm
it sounds serious doesnt it
a pigment mutation
derek gives norman a disparaging look
norman picks up some cake and takes a bite
ooh will you try this cake
i think it might have nuts in it
shows his wrist so
aarons uncle says i might be allergic to nuts
then dont eat nuts
put the cake down
i cant not eat the cake
thats what i do when im stressed
i eat cake
i bet you wont eat it when your arm falls off
norman sniffs the cake
will you just try it and tell me if theres nuts in it
i dont want to
just do me a favor norman is pushing the cake towards dereks mouth
get away from me
derek gets up and walks off leaving norman spitting out the cake
from under the table jeff pops up
you havent seen a pill bottle around have you
a valium pill bottle
but can you try this jeff smiles nervously and goes back to his search on the floor
jeff slides across the floor past uncle russell sitting at the other end of the table
an older lady turns to russell
edward and i watched the tony awards every year
we would get all dressed up and sip cocktails
im going to miss him so much
the way you look you wont be far behind
the mourner looks shocked
jeff continues his search along the floor
cynthia is sitting quietly with duncan
im sure well start soon
he looks toward the house and sees norman exit
duncan wants to avoid him
lets go inside
in a moment
duncan gets up and heads toward the house
he passes norman
doctor i just have a duncan doesnt stop leaving norman holding his wrist
norman looks over and sees cynthia
he sits next to her
ill be alright
i know hes watching over me
you think so
i mean there are a lot of fine ones up in heaven
anna nicole smiths dead too you know
might be watching over her
norman sits next to cynthia
death is a terrible thing
did you check to make sure he
was wearing shoes
i hear they steal the shoes
and i hope you took off his ring cause if its worth anything someone is going to take that too
cynthia stares at norman
before he died did he have a rash
she gets up and exits
norman notices jeffs pill bottle on the ground
he picks it up and puts it in his pocket
the camera closes in on the closed garage door
we hear hushed voices
you dont understand
if we dont give him the money hes going to show mom the picture
let me think let me think
ryan is trying to come up with a solution
i think you should pay him the money
what do you mean you think i should pay him the money
where the hell is all your money
im in debt up to my ass
im broke man
so after paying for the funeral the clothes the catering
now im supposed to shell out thirty thousand dollars
hes your father too
youre the oldest
besides youve been living off mom and dad long enough
you must have some money saved
you havent paid rent in two years
i have not been living off of them
ive been living with them
no i havent paid rent but dad hasnt worked in five years
who do you think has been paying all the bills
well if youve got money problems and ive got money problems what can we do
aaron shows ryan the photo again
youve got to pay him
oscar is sitting on the toilet unrolling the toilet paper
join the others
join the others
elaine leans against the door
she tries the door
its still locked
jeff frantically searches the bushes where oscar pushed him looking for the pill bottle
he finds nothing
uncle russell is creating havoc at the buffet table
hes pushing people aside and poking them with his cane
are you alright
no my nephew is dead and these bastards ate all the potato salad
nearby mourners look appalled
the reverend looks over and sees aaron and ryan coming down the kitchen corridor
she approaches them
reverend davis appears in front of aaron and ryan
i think were just about ready to start the service so would you mind giving us five minutes
aaron walks off followed by ryan
he passes michelle whos sitting on the couch
she stands up
is everything okay
im really sorry honey but buying a condo is going to have to be put on hold just for now
what are you talking about
babe you know i wouldnt do this unless i had a good reason
whats the reason
i havent got time right now please
ill explain later
aaron walks off to join ryan whos at the door of the study
frank is reading aarons manuscript
ryan and aaron enter
so you and my
so when i called my father and he didnt answer he was with you
aaron realizes what frank is reading
hey hey hey
aaron rushes over and takes the manuscript away from frank
what are you doing with my manuscript
its not ready
he puts it in the desk
well you left it on a coffee table
whats that supposed to mean
well when you put things on coffee tables its assumed its for everybody
it kind of is
can we get to the point here
fine by me
aaron is now extremely irritated
he exchanges a look with ryan confirming that theres no other way out
if i write this check then thats it
you give us the photos and stay away from our mother
aaron sits down at the desk and reluctantly takes out his check book
he starts writing
is it your first one
aaron stops writing and looks up at him
its a first draft
aaron continues to write the check
i tried writing once
didnt work for me either
i think its just a gift
you either have it or you dont
it must be hard for you though especially since your younger brother is such a great writer
your father and i read black hurt together
we loved it
he was so proud of you
aaron rips the check into little pieces
i cant do it
aaron what are you doing
theres no way in the world im giving him my hard earned money
dont be stupid
ill pay you back as soon as my money comes in
he comes in today
of all days he picks the day of my fathers funeral
who the hell is he
he has the pictures
who cares what hes got
let him show the world
put it on facebook
i dont care
lets just get it over with
theres a long pause as everyone seems to be deciding what to do
finally frank stands up
this is on your head
frank heads towards the door
ryan rushes to stand in front of the door blocking franks get out of my way
lets just discuss this a minute
theres nothing to discuss
frank grabs the door and tries to open it
get out of my way
he tries to push past but ryan covers his mouth muffling his cries
get out of my way
ryan restrains frank
a few mourners hear the commotion and the muffled voices
they turn to look
ryan grabs frank and wrestles him to the ground
aaron watches absolutely shocked as ryan and frank roll around on the floor
aaron jumps up and stands between them and the door
ryan what are you doing
get off me
ryan is trying to muffle franks screams
aaron help me
ryan is holding frank down and trying to keep him quiet
aaron you got any rope or duct tape
im not a serial killer
i dont keep rope and duct tape in my pocket
well just grab something
indicating with his head there from the curtains
aaron grabs the cord thats tied around the curtains
he holds it over the wrestling duo but ryans hands are occupied with frank
tie his legs
aaron grabs his legs and in doing so falls on top of frank as well
as he wraps the curtain cord around franks legs
this is a really bad idea
elaine leans against the wall listening as oscar hums in the bathroom
she slides down the wall and sits on the floor
from a rooftop pov we see the window slide open and oscar dripping with sweat and not wearing a shirt lean out
he takes a deep breath of fresh air and listens to the birds
he climbs out the window revealing hes completely naked
he stands on the roof and lifts his hands to the sky
michelle comes up and sits next to elaine
tell me about it
how would i know
hes been avoiding me all day
were trying to get pregnant
but i cant really do that by myself can i
i feel like im making him eat brussel sprouts every time we do it
elaine looks at her
the guys father just died
dont you think this is a bad day for sex
dont you think i know that
at least your husband didnt ruin the funeral
its a funeral its already ruined
when you start off with a dead guest of honor how much worse can it get
ryan and aaron struggle with frank whos muffled cries are starting to fade
get that tie
aaron grabs the necktie from off the desk
what am i supposed to do with the tie
whatever you do with a tie
i dont know what to just stuff it in his mouth
damn i have to do everything
apparently everything but write a damn check
suddenly the door opens and norman enters
aaron do you know what was in this cake i angle on frank who looks at norman bug eyed hoping hell help
shut the goddamn door
shocked norman does as hes told
it takes norman a moment to register that aaron and ryan are sitting on top of frank
frank continues screaming through the cloth
what is going on
who is that guy
ryan thinks quickly
hes having a seizure
i just found some valium outside
would that help
give him some
frank shakes his head no
norman gets on his knees with the guys and opens the bottle
this should help
calm you down
frank tries to protest but cant
ryan holds franks mouth open as aaron holds his nose closed
norman pours a few pills into franks mouth then ryan holds franks mouth shut
suddenly the door opens again and jeff walks in
have you seen a little brown pill bottle lying around they all turn to jeff
frank looks at him hoping this time hell get saved
i told you to lock the damn door
you said shut the damn door
jeff locks the door and looks shocked
whats going on
hes having a seizure
why is he all tied up
no one knows what to say
oscar stands on the roof naked breathing in the fresh air
jeff aaron ryan and norman are all kneeling over frank
hes blackmailing you
if i could tell everybody it wouldnt be blackmail
look just trust us
hes the bad guy
well explain later
what are you going to do with him
everyonerealizes they have no answer to this question
yeah ryan what are we going to do with him
ryan doesnt have any answers
i dont know
you dont know
come on youre the big writer
youre the one who came up with black hurt
dream up something where we all live happily ever after
we cant keep him tied up forever
how long do you think those valium are going to last
yeah i found that bottle of valium
we gave him a few to calm him down
norman hands him the bottle
jeff stands up and heads over to the door
they all head over to jeff
frank looks extremely curious to know whats going on
everyone talks very quietly so that frank cant hear
what is it
the thing is
those pills arent really valium
its acid and
oscar took one by mistake
thats why hes acting crazy
jeff what the hell are you doing with this stuff
a friend left them at my place
what friend amy winehouse
wait youre telling us that elaines boyfriend who knocked over our fathers coffin had just one of these things
and you gave him how many
norman looks a bit guilty
looking at frank poor bastard
i thought they were valium
they all turn and look at frank who is looking back at them increasingly concerned by whatever conversation they are having and the pitying expressions on their faces
maybe we should call an ambulance
you cant do that
ill go to jail
if anyone finds out this guys been force fed acid we could all be arrested
so what then
whats going to happen
is he going to die
i dont think so
i doubt it
the moment is broken by someone trying the door followed by a knock
cynthia is knocking on the door
they all back away from the door
are you in there
they look at each other in panic
as normal as possible be out in a minute mom
ryan looks at norman and jeff
to norman and jeff okay
we have to go out there
you two stay in here and watch him
ryan closes the curtains
what do you mean watch him
just make sure he doesnt escape
lock the door behind us
well deal with him after the funeral
aaron and ryan open the study door leaving norman and jeff to take care of frank
aaron and ryan come outside trying to look as normal as possible
they see cynthia standing with the reverend
hows it going mom
reverend davis wants to talk with you
norman locks the door behind them
reverend davis tries to remain cool but shes agitated
lookie here brother
ive been patient
we all know its a virtue but im about done with patience
now if we dont resume service soon were going to need to have a little conversation about my compensation
can you just give us another five minutes
the reverend doesnt look too pleased
is everything okay boys
ryan and aaron kiss their mother and walk off
aaron and ryan enter and slam the door
why didnt you just pay him the money
why did you tie him up
do you want mom to find out
what is wrong with you
they start to argue
we hear their muffled argument through the door
uncle russell rolls up to derek who is sitting at the kitchen table
whats your problem
women are my problem
no such thing as having a woman without a problem
if they didnt have problems do you think theyd let us touch em
let me tell you something about women
smarter than you think they are
but not as smart as they think they are
she acts like she doesnt care that i exist
i mean how can she not feel what i feel
oh she feels it
shes playing hard to get
she wants you to work for it
look let me tell something about women
they want a man who can control them
i know they talk all this oprah beyonce single women bs but what they really want is an old school man
listen here boy
this is what you do you walk up to her slap her
you want me to hit her
has not hitting her worked
look then you grab her and kiss her
the harder the better
are you sure cause that oh man i gotta shit
wheres the can
he rolls away quickly
norman and jeff are sitting in the study
frank is on the floor tied up breathing heavily and making gurgling sounds
i cant believe you gave him five
even if they were valium thats too many
i wouldnt give a guy five cough drops
suddenly they hear the doorknob rattle
norman and jeff both look terrified
jeff covers his mouth
neither norman nor jeff want to speak
they argue in gestures
finally jeff relents
i need the toilet
jeff and norman both look panicked
norman goes to the door
cant you use the one upstairs
im in a wheelchair you idiot
how am i supposed to get up the stairs
norman and jeff look at each other not knowing what to do
open the damn door
uncle russell starts banging on the door with his cane
what are we going to do
they look at frank whos starting to look high as a kite
well stick him behind the couch
just looking for the key
they pick frank up and dump him behind the couch
jeff stays with frank to keep him quiet as norman opens the door
uncle russell wheels himself inside
what the hell is wrong with you people
im about to take a dump in my pants
elaine is still standing outside the bathroom
derek comes up to talk to her
elaines completely drained and stressed
what do you want derek
i just want to talk
please dont make me go through this again
the only reason you dont want to go out with me is because your dad likes me
the reason i dont want to go out with you is because it was a mistake
i was drunk off my ass
you could have been a donkey

aaron and ryan share a look
aaron shows michelle the picture
norman lifts uncle russell out of the chair
norman is struggling to hold uncle russell up
have you got me
yes ive got you
come on quick quick quick
alright im trying to see where the toilet is
he maneuvers uncle russell to the toilet
no you do it
how can i do it
norman reluctantly helps uncle russell pull his pants down
take down my drawers
who calls them drawers
norman pulls them down
its all down
am i there
am i there
norman looks and sees uncle russell is right over the toilet
just sit down
uncle russell sits down on the toilet trapping normans hand underneath and lets loose
ooh thats better
norman pulls his hand out and looks at it in shock
angle on normans hand has shit on the fingers
he starts freaking out and screaming
jeff hears norman and jumps up
jeff goes into the bathroom to see whats going on
jeff opens the door and rushes in but is stopped in his tracks by normans shitty hand
norman panicking rushes to the sink turns on the faucet full blast and sticks his hand under the water
this causes a great splashing
frank peeks up from behind the couch
hes clearly high
with his hands still tied he struggles to get to his feet
norman frantically washes his hands
norman still has his face down
just come off
norman turns and we see he has shit splattered on his face
jeff points to his face
you missed some
norman turns slowly and looks in the mirror
he freaks out
oh i think ive got some of it in my mouth
norman desperately rushes to wash it off
frank is now up on his feet and running around like a rabid animal
jeff pulls norman up and shakes him
pull yourself together
would you rather get caught or have shit in your mouth
uncle russell has fallen asleep on the toilet
frank is running around the room
through the door we see uncle russell sleeping on the toilet
frank jumps up and down on the sofa
he loses his balance and falls on the coffee table head first
he cracks his head on the corner and falls straight down
jeff and norman rush out of the bathroom to find frank lying on the floor motionless blood on his head
hey man you alright
check him again
wake him up
whats his name
i dont know
jeff looks at norman but he doesnt have a better idea
jeff bends down and shakes him
larry wake up
its time to get up
from the bathroom uncle russell starts to stir
norman quickly closes the door
maybe its not larry
try something else
jeff pinches frank
still no response
he must be breathing
he has to be breathing
please god let him be breathing
jeff looks concerned
he checks for a pulse
he looks up at norman with an expression that tells us all we need to know
michelle walks into frame and stops at the coffin
ryan stand on either side of her
so thats it
were just giving him all the money weve saved
well its not that simple
aaron refused to pay
how come you couldnt pay ryan
thats not the point
besides the only reason aaron tore up the check is because the guy started talking bad about his novel
michelle looks confused
you let him read your novel
you wouldnt let me read your novel
are you screwing him too
cause lord knows youre not screwing me
norman comes out of the study and closes the door behindhim
he leans against the door dripping with sweat
aaron and ryan look over and see norman
angle on norman as he pastes a maniacal grin on his face and crosses into the living room
as he moves through the throng of mourners they are all unnerved by him
the hugesmile never leaves his face
angle on ryan aaron and michelle watching norman concerned
norman approaches and stands on the other side of the coffin
norman why are you grinning like that
to aaron and ryan can you come to the study for a second
aaron can see from normans face and the sweat on his forehead that something serious has happened
then he sees cynthia sitting in the corner
ill be back soon
can you check on mom
michelle crosses to cynthia
hey are you doing okay
its going to be alright
if youve never given life child how can you understand death
jeff is leaning on the window
theres a knock at the door
jeff opens the door
norman ryan and aaron enter
norman locks the door behind them
aaron rushes over to the body
call an ambulance
theres no point
what do you mean theres no point
look at him
is there a kind of dead aaron
what the hell did you do to him
we didnt do anything
well he was alive when i left
he hit his head on the table

norman looks at his watch

youre not going anywhere

oh my god im going to die

oh my god do you know how fast a rash spreads in prison
aaron smacks norman
pull yourself together
norman calms down
after a beat ryan speaks
look no one here knows who this guy is
nobody knows his name
they probably didnt even notice him
didnt notice him
hes four fucking feet tall
look all we have to do is get rid of the body
itll be like he came and left

it took me two months to get rid of a couch
did any of you happen to notice the size of uncle edwards coffin
everyone looks at jeff
you want to bury him with my father
i mean its not like hes going to know
thats not the point
you have to admit it makes sense aaron
the coffins there the hole in the grounds there
hell be gone finished end of story
unless you have a better suggestion
aaron desperately tries to think of an alternative
derek and elaine are sitting in the corridor
elaine looks drained of energy
dereks smoking a cigarette
no matter what you say im convinced well be together
yeah well we all make mistakes
i used to be convinced i was going to marry prince
what happened there
you still could
youre an idiot
you only live once
you might as well do whatever it is that makes you happy
yes but maybe i dont think of life anymore as all about me me me
maybe ive discovered theres something outside of myself that i care about
and maybe you should too
derek looks hurt
thats kind of cold
i care about you
no derek you care about you
you only care about me in relation to how i affect you
theres a difference
thats not true elaine
oscar is squatting down rolling his head around when he hears elaines voice
derek get over yourself
elaine moves over to the window
derek follows her
he slaps her on the butt
elaine whirls around
derek grabs her on the arms
im the man for you and youre coming home with me
he kisses her
oscar turns to look at the window and sees derek and elaine kissing
elaine pulls away and punches derek in the face
he staggers back and sees oscar in the window
what is that
elaine turns around
oscar moves away from the window and further out on the ledge
elaine opens the window and sticks her head out
what are you doing

i saw you kissing him
i wasnt kissing him

derek sticks his head out the window behind elaine
youre committing adultery

oscar look at me
she turns to derek

she pushes him back inside
as mourners mill about the lawn we hear im going to jump

we only see oscar from the waist up
angle on oscar

ryan aaron jeff and norman are as we left them
theres just no way we can do it
suddenly theres a knock on the door
norman its derek

aaron and jeff drag frank to the bathroom door

aaron opens the door and we see uncle russell still on the toilet
he looks up
aaron slams the door
we can hear russells muffled shouting coming from behind the bathroom door
why is uncle russell on the toilet
how could you forget
what the hell is wrong with you
another loud bang on the door
aaron open the door
norman opens the door as aaron runs over to keep derek from entering
aaron opens the door an inch
what is it
aaron wheres norman
from behind the door im here
its oscar he went crazy
hes derek realizes that something weirds going on

derek puts aside his curiosity for the time being
look oscars on the roof stark naked

jeff rushes to the door
where are you going

if he jumps my sister is going to kill me
jeff rushes out
to ryan and norman wait here
aaron follows jeff but he does not run
he walks out
jeff rushes through the empty room
aaron walks behind him slowly
jeff runs through the kitchen door and joins the mourners looking at oscar on the roof
get back here
i believe i can fly
i believe i can touch the sky
angle on aaron who steps out and sees everybody watching oscar
elaine is still leaning out the window
oscar come inside
well have some coffee
he climbs up on the roof
she climbs out the window
the mourners see that oscar is naked
everybody aaron notices that everybody is captivated by the drama
elaine follows oscar on the roof
duncan sees elaine on the roof
elaine what are you doing
elaine sees oscar climbing further up the roof
elaine follows oscar
aaron realizes this is his chance
he heads back inside
michelle catches him at the door
what are you doing
i think i can get rid of this guy but i need you to stay out here and try to stop anyone from coming in
ill do what i can
she heads back to the crowd on the lawn
as aaron goes through the doorway of the kitchen derek passes him on the way out to the lawn to see whats happening
norman is standing in the corner
aaron knocks on the door
who is it
norman opens the door
everyones out in the garden
weve gotta move the body now
ryan and aaron grab frank
as norman runs out
norman looks around and sees that its clear
he goes back to the study and opens the door
aaron and ryan carry frank out as norman looks around
make sure no one comes in
as they disappear around the corner norman closes the study door
he turns just in time to find reverend davis approaching
to reverend davis hi
the reverend looks around not knowing why norman is being so especially friendly to her
ryan and aaron hurry across the living room carrying frank
norman is blocking reverend davis
so what made you decide to get your god on
look im sorry i really need to use id like to make a confession
im not a priest
thats okay cause im not catholic
aaron and ryan get to the coffin and ryan opens it up
theres an intense moment as they look down at their father in the coffin
they both stop for a moment speechless
aaron we have to do this
aaron looks up at ryan and nods his assent
ryan and aaron lift up frank and try their best to put him in the coffin
norman still blocks the reverend
what do you think gods favorite color is
i have no idea
ill bet its blue
the skys blue
the seas are blue
and the winds blew too
ryan and aaron are staring at the body
frank is on his stomach tops to tails with their father
aaron looks at it and decides that its just wrong
we cant leave it like that
ryan looks down and laughs
in a strange way this might have been what he wanted
be serious for a second
they begin lifting him again
norman is doing his best to keep reverend davis at bay
aaron and ryan have swiveled the body around so that frank is facing upwards
why do you say i dont take anything seriously
you complain about me all the time but if i didnt play the bad boy you couldnt play the martyr
aarons so great aarons so right aarons so responsible
back to normal why dont you try laughing and enjoying life once in a while
it might make you a better a writer
norman is still talking to reverend davis
she looks like she really doesnt want to be there
look i must get to a phone
theres a man on the roof whos going to jump
im addicted to strip clubs
the shoes the poles the smell
i just like to take my money and throw it in the air
i like to make it rain
elaine is stepping off the fire escape ladder and onto the roof peak
oscar sits sadly on the roof peak with his back to the crowd
please dont do this
then why were you with him
i wasnt with him
yes you were
i saw you
derek is laughing next to jeff
we see the view from their pov
elaine finally gets closer to oscar
ill never be good enough
not for your dad and not for you
oscar please just come inside
you go inside
come with me
because youre going to be a father
oscar looks at her shocked
were going to have a child
angle on oscar and elaine
oscar is overcome with emotion
elaine holds out her hand
i wont be able to do it without you
very slowly a naked oscar walks toward her and they embrace
the crowd applauds
angle on michelle
what about me
i want a baby
would somebody get me pregnant
everybody looks at michelle
she smiles weakly
seeing oscar is safe jeff is very relieved
norman and the reverend hear applause
reverend davis heads back out to see whats up
norman turns to check on ryan and aaron
aaron and ryan are just about to close the lid
they both look down at their father one last time
aaron takes a moment to touch his fathers hand
ryan takes a long look as he closes the coffin
oscar turns toward the crowd
were having a baby
general approval noises and applause come from the crowd
duncan looks appalled
duncan heads toward the kitchen door
he passes a shocked looking derek
michelle follows and speaks loudly as duncan is about to enter the kitchen
oscars off the roof
aaron and ryan quickly shut the coffin a moment before duncan enters the living room through the kitchen door and crosses on the way to the stairs
im going to kill him
jeff follows duncan in looks at the coffin then looks at aaron and ryan questioning them with his eyes
they return the look with silent assurance that the job is done
michelle comes in
hey is he gone
everybody breathes a sigh of relief
elaine helps oscar through the window
elaine opens the bathroom door and duncan enters
elaine helps oscar get dressed
thank god youre safe
what the hell is wrong with you
stay away from my daughter
look dad elaine stay out of this
no im not staying out of this
remember how i told you we were moving in together
well i lied

duncan is shocked
were getting married
elaine you dont have to marry him just because youre pregnant
im not marrying him because im pregnant
im marrying him because i love him
how can you love him
hes an idiot
dad this is my life
if you dont like it too bad
but if you want to keep me and my child in your life youd better change your attitude especially about my husband
elaine exits taking oscar with her
cynthia walks up to aaron
baby i really think we should start again now
have you seen uncle russell
aaron remembers where he is and looks at ryan
they rush off to the study passing jeff
jeff checks his pockets and realizes the pills are gone again
he goes off to find them
aaron and ryan enter the study and head toward the closed bathroom door
they open it and find uncle russell sitting on the toilet
what the hell is going on in this place
im so sorry uncle russell
there was someone on the roof never mind that
what about that dead body you dragged in here
aaron and ryan feign ignorance
what dead body
dont mess with me
i know a dead body when i see one
i live in a retirement home
norman sniffs his fingers worried
in the background we see elaine entering the room with oscar now dressed but still looking a bit wired
people respond with scattered applause and congratulations
derek walks over and joins norman
did you hear that
shes having a kid
derek looks at norman whos looking sort of distant
hows your skin thing
its probably nothing
im more worried about hepatitis c after having uncle russells shit in my mouth
i think im feeling yellow
norman touches his skin as he walks away leaving derek confused
angle on jeff frantically looking for the pill bottle
he gives up and sits in a chair
angle on ryan is wheeling uncle russell into the room as aaron moves to his seat
im telling you i saw the guy
he was dead
i know you did russell
we all did
in the bathroom
ryan offers a look to the other mourners indicating that uncle russells a bit mad and shouldnt be listened to
angle on michelle comes over to aaron
i cant believe what a nightmare today has been
i dont know
its been sort of exciting
aaron looks at her
for a funeral i mean
listen about the condo and the baby well work it out
lets just get this day over with
then we can worry about the rest of our lives
aaron hugs michelle
i cant believe i still have to do this eulogy
with everything ive just found out
it doesnt change anything does it
not a thing
reverend davis approaches aaron looking at her watch and appearing flustered
were going to have to fly through this now
i already missed a funeral and two christenings
do you want an open casket
the reverend looks shocked at the reaction but ignores it
she stands up at the front and speaks quickly
everybody in their seats now
she snaps her fingers hey you sit down
people settle into their seats
ryan manages to squeeze in next to martina
he smiles at her flirtatiously
cynthia throws ryan a look and he gets up and goes to sit with her
speaking very quickly id like to apologize on behalf of the family for all of the distractions
i hope that everyone is settled and ready to continue with the service
aaron the oldest son would like to say a few words about his father
michelle gives aaron an encouraging look as he makes his way to the front
aaron clears his throat and prepares to begin
the room is absolutely silent
he takes a deep breath
angle on the reverend nodding for aaron to hurry up
angle on aaron
was an exceptional suddenly a loud banging emanates from the coffin
everyone stares at it in stunned silence
jeff looks over to norman whose eyes are as wide as saucers
aaron looks like a deer caught in headlights
he looks at ryan who gestures to him to continue
he nervously struggles on
my father was an exceptional man
everyone stares at the coffin in awe
aaron bravely continues
not only did he live for his family but he was always there for others
what the hell is going on
theres someone in there
i knew it
i knew it
suddenly the coffin lid flips off and everyone stares in wonder as frank sits up looking like a crazy person and babbling incoherently
several people scream
frank opens the other end of the coffin and looks at his dead lover
trying to cover what the hell are you doing in my dads coffin
frank starts grabbing at edwards body screaming
ryan norman and jeff try to pull frank out of the coffin but hes holding onto the corpse
finally they get frank out and carry him from the room
as he passes cynthia the photos fall out of his pocket at her feet
as duncan closes the coffin again cynthia bends down and picks up one of the photographs and stares at it
her face turns to horror as she makes out the image
the noise in the room is broken by cynthias furious cry
she drops the photos and runs at frank
cynthia tackles frank and starts beating him
as she hits him he was with you
duncan picks up the photos
he shows them to uncle russell
i always thought he had a little sugar in his tank
everything has descended into total chaos until aaron finally shouts across the room
everyone including frank and cynthia looks at aaron stunned
they all freeze
theres a long silence
he had his
shortcomings but he took care of his family
he loved his family
he loved this house
he worked hard
all i wanted today was to show him how much we all loved and admired him
to give him the respect that he deserved
is that really so much to ask
we all get so distracted by the
little things in life
we forget about the important things
like the fact that we lost a great man
the mourners look up at aaron with undivided attention
so maybe he loved dreamgirls more than most men
we dont know why a man makes the choices he makes
but i do know that my father made the best choices he could make
life is complicated
were just thrown here together in a world filled with chaos and confusion
and we do our best
and dad did his best
aaron looks over at the coffin
he speaks we see shots of cynthia frank jeff norman duncan as they are moved by aarons words
he taught us to go for what we wanted in life because you never know how long youre going to be here
and whether you succeed
or you fail
the important thing is that you tried
michelle looks up at her husband with pride
we see the various other mourners looking at aaron and listening
so when you all leave here today i want you to remember dad for who he really was
a decent loving man who never condemned anyone for how they lived
who never cast disparaging remarks or held prejudices against race gender
if only we could all be as giving as generous as understanding as my father
even dead my father has more character than everyone in this room
if i am half the man my father was my child will be incredibly blessed
aaron turns and walks out of the room
everyone watches him go
michelle follows him out of the room
the house has emptied out
all the cars are gone
aaron is laying on the couch looking drained
ryan comes down the stairs
it looks like hes had some time to recover
he walks over and takes a seat
ive asked mom to come live with me for awhile
itll give you and michelle a chance to breathe a bit you know
move and everything
aaron looks at ryan surprised
