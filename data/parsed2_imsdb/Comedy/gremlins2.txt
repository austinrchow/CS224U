written by charlie haas revised the same crowded chinatown street where rand peltzer first found gizmo the mogwai
as locals bustle past angle favors the stairs to the basement curiosity shop
wing the storekeeper who took gizmo home after the gremlins night of carnage opens the door beginning his day
as he lights his pipe he hears a commotion upstairs
pedestrians dodge a long black limousine as it pulls up short
angle reveals that most of the stores on the block have closed going out of business signs and boarded up windows
forster a sour faced man in a business suit gets out of the limo followed by three beefy men also in suits
the three big men take a big screen tv vt and a vcr out of the car
wings store tj
wing looks up from hers game as the four men sweep into the store
mister wi daniel clamp would like to see you
the men quickly set up the big screen tv set and vcr
one of the men puts in a tape and hits some buttons and the tv screen fills with the face of daniel clamp
at a young hes new yorks most successful real estate developer
good morning mister wing
lets out through to key issues okay
im prepared to increase my offer substantially
now mister wing youre attached to your business
i appreciate that
im attached to my own business
i develop the biggest buildings in new york and you sell ah little things
but im not just talking about money here
on the big screen tv the image widens to incim a an easel beside clam holding an architects render that shows the grandiose of a huge office building
take a look mister wing the clamp chinatown center where business gets oriented
when i put up a building its the biggest its the newest its the best
people are going to be killing each other to get into this building the soft o
twittering of gizmo is heard from the rear alcove of the store
now weve been able to reach an understanding with everyone on the block except for you
let me show you what i willing to do for you a s tand and souvenir cone on right here under the at the foot traffic thrr here is going
to make the building look like a ghost town
wing regards the video image impassively
please if us know when youve made a decision mister wing
you know i believe that theres always an area of agreement that two people can reach
the clamp corporations logo a stylized c fills the wereen replacing clamps image
yes a man can always agree with others
it is more difficult to agree with oneself
does that mean you hes interrupted as mr
wing coughs a rattling spasm that sounds deeply unhealthy
when the coughing subsides he answers forster
please tell mister clamp that the answer is no
keep the tv
wing walks clamps men to the door in b
hold on the tv set and a small furry paw that reaches into frame to change the tv channel
with the change of stations the tv screen fills with a scene from a rambo picture
sylvester stallone addresses the movie to survive a war
youve got to become war
then he screws an explosive filled metal arrowhead onto an arrow and shoots the arrow from a bow
the arrow hits a helicopter which bursts into flames
but as the helicopter starts to burn mr
wing comes back and angrily turns the tv set off addressing the unseen gizmo
an invention for fools
as he starts coughing again forster and the bodyguards are dri away from mr
im sorry that didnt work out sir
i thought hed like the tv
you hear that cough
the guy must be eighty maybe ninety
we can wait
a sting of solemn chinese music covers the dissolve tot seen through distance and morning mist a burial ceremony is taking place to the accompaniment of the continuing music
a huge office tower whose sign reads clamp premiere regency near a sign reading clamp cable network a news producer and reporter are editing videotape that we see on monitors
the tape is of the reporter doing his standup in chinatown on mr
wings boarded up block
mister wing ath removes the last obstacl eveloper daniel clamps long ehinatown project
is then we go to the boss the video image switches to clamp being interviewed behind his spotless high tech desk
obviously a sad occasion but the bright side is that we can go ahead with something that will mean a great deal to the community down there
that old guy had some neat stuff in his store
you think theyll auction it off or
i hear theyre just gonna tear it down
camera moves through the deserted store and settles on gizmos alcove
the mourning mogwai has climbed into his old cage and site in there with the door open
he wears a black armband and sings a sad minor key version of his familiar song
moving toward us fast
c close on gizmo reacting in fear cthe crane arm advances toward him
a wider angle shows the crane c iing into the store
gizmo leaps down from the cage and narrowly escapes with the crane arm right behind him
as a rain of wood and planter debris falls around him he runs away
into the alley behind the store and scampers to safety behind an ashcan his chest heaving
but now he looks up startled and scared a pair of human hands reach down into frame and capture him
and showing the ostentatious structure daniel clamp is building on the grave of mr
the copy reads coming soon clamp chinatown center where business gets oriented
on the cut there is music a rap song such as grandmaster flashs the message
its like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder how i keep from going under
as main titles begin pan down to the outright madness of new york at rush hour
herds of workers push past vendors hookers card monte artists etc
camera settles on billy peltzer and his girlfriend kate heroes of the gremlin siege of kingston falls
though theyre a few years older now billy and kate are still small town types who keep getting elbowed aside by the sidewalk crowd
billy wears business clothes and kate is in a uniform type skirt and blazer
spot universal price code type bar codes on the chest of billys sportscoat and kates blazer
i should be finished by six tonight
if we go straight from work we can make the early bird special at the movies
its going to be close
maybe we could do it tomorrow no tomorrows when the futtermans are coming to town
mister futterman must be getting better if he can travel
his wife says hes getting better
hes just been rattled
i guess having a bunch of monsters drive a snow plow through jour living room could kind of that to you
he almost got kied
checks his watc li were gonna be late he steps to the corner snails a taxi
you goin a the airport
no the the taxi roars away billy lets go of the door handle just in time
i dont think were getting the hang of new york
follow billy and kate as they approach the clamp office building where we saw guys editing videotape earlier

they arrive at the doors to the buildings lobby
in addition to regular glass doors there are a couple of revolving doors want to try the revolving doors today
before kate can answer a worker enters one of the revolving doors
the power assisted door going too fast whooshes him inside and we hear aagghhh
they use a regular door instead
the ultra modern m j i tal style lobby includes several retail businesses includingi i ss estaurants a frozen yogurt stand a beauty parlor and cloth res
as billy and kate enter they av i l thread their way through several workers sprawled in front othe revolving doors
the workers are getting dizzily to their feet gathering their spilled briefcases etc
spot bar codes like billys and kates on the chests of several of the workers
kate waves hello to a thirtyish woman doreen whos guiding a tour group through the lobby
doreen wears a uniform like kates plus a matching hat in the shape of the building
hope youve enjoyed your tour of the worlds most modern automated office building
dont forget copies of mr
clamps best selling book i took manhattan are on sale at the newsstand
dont let things get to you
follow billy to a bank of elevators
he pushes a button and a soothing electronic voice speaks
thank you for pushing the button
the elevator will be here soon
nearby camera picks up daniel clamps lieutenant forster
as forster walks hurriedly through the lobby his belt pager at the sound forster changes course heading for an alcove offer the lobby where he unlks a cabinet and opens
it i eveal it big tv screen with clamps impatient face on it and a i e camera on top

the elevator stops at their floor and the doors open
billy follows marla out into int
s the advertising department of daniel clamps empire occupies modern open plan offices endless beige partitions form tiny cubicles full of ergonomic furniture
unseen speakers pipe in white noise low volume static to insulate conversations
listen this deadline
its not my fault
theyre making me miserable so i have to make you miserable
its a complete heart attack disaster horgor story
as billy and marla walk t ass a worker whos t ing to get a drink from the d ar ygr water when he pushes the button the f ainss
got vershoots by several inches splashing onto the worker contorts himself to get a drink b is face splashed when the fountain surges
billy and marla a lie at billys cubicle whose work station consists of a dra g board and several drawers
the phone is equipped with a video screen
spot a small struggling potted plant and pinned to the cubicle wall billys drawing of the main street of kingston falls
on billys drawing board is an illustration of clamps projected chinatown building a l s monstrosity with insane pagoda touches
but billy has tried to breathe some e into it wit r t the street kids flying dragon kites etc
marla looks over billys shoulder at the drawing
its almost finished
i just have to make some that courtyard looks cold
thatd be nicer with the trees
are they going to plant trees there
revised cx inu no but youre going to draw them
but maria elms
hes about to sit down to work when daniel clamps lieutenant forster and his clipboard carrying assistant come down the row of cubicles looking around
hi mister forster
forster nods at marla runs an eye over billys cubicle
it looks like somebody hasnt i employee manual
d it r as he speaks forster opens a i therette folder and takes out a bar code reading wand attached to the folder by curly cable
he runs the wand over the bar code on billys chest and reads from an lcd display in the folder
uh whats unauthorized potted plant possible aphid infestation
as forsters assistant jots on his clipboard billy puts the plant in a desk drawer and forster spots billys drawing on his partition
what ig this
my home town
mister peltier do you know how much the clamp organization has spent to provide its employees with art by recognized artists at this facility
he points to a piece of anonymous bank art on a nearby wall
authorized yes air
it was just a a little touch yes
maybe eyerybods here would like to do some little touches
coffee mugs that say worlds greatest lover
the cute little hula doll they bought in hawaii
the snoopy comic that just says it jj
youd like that wouldnt qu mister peltzer
d i don t see any coming to work every day in a jy q hundred million dollar flea marks xzz he turns to move on
with a z right
as the assistant follows forster away billy puts his drawing of kingston falls in a pocket
billy this is just what i dont need right now
do you realize weve got department review in three weeks
this is a nuclear meltdown disaster i mean it
kate leads a group of tourists through the lobby
the clamp centre is the most advanced smart building in america with the latest in security communications and climate control
if youll follow me over here
still talking she takes them toward a staircase
the clamp centre is just one part of mister clamps round the world business network which includes construction sports finance and a popular line of jams and jellies
and of course as those of you who have cable tv at home know the clamp cable network
cable studios t iol room close on a video image oft v with marge show
marge takes a dish from one of many r ovens on her set
some people have written in to say that if theyre serving these dishes in a dark room maybe for those romantic occasions they notice a glow coming from some of
the meat courses
now thats perfectly normal
reveal that this image is on a control room monitor at the clamp cable studios
billy carrying a shopping bag passes the control roomand turns down a narrow hallway
the run down set of grandpa freds house of horrors a hosted horror movie show
billy comes in and stands behind the cameraman
grandpa fred the guy who tried to talk to daniel clamp on the lobby tv hookup earlier is an old trouper in a moth eaten dracula outfit
hes giving the show his demoralized best shot
tonights movie is so scary the people who saw it when it came out in the theaters twelve years ago are just learning how to speak simple phrases and eat
solid food again
talk about scary its a good thing your grandpa fred is here with you he waits for something he expected to hear but it doesnt happen
he breaks character
wheres the moan
from boo the what
theres posed to be a moan from t ck and i say oh renfield y a o u want some more flies dont you and i go back there and
open the door oh
can somebody find the tape with the moan
grandpa fred sits down disgusted
billy goes over to him
hey i was sorry to hear about your new time slot
i think theyre making a big mistake
its a disaster
people that watch tv at three thirty in the morning are not scared of the wolfman
the only thing that scares those people is getting sober and finding work
i brought you something
billy reaches into his shopping bag and pulls out a mechanized bat that flaps its wings as billy pulls the trigger
grandpa fred recoils
watch it with that thing
billy puts the bat on top of a cobwebbed tv set thats part of grandpa freds set
i thought it would look good over here
frankly kid this was not what i had in mind
i went into broadcasting i wanted to do news
horror movies can be meaningful fred
you should run some of the classics frankenstein m a cula
all the great horror movies are in black and white
mister clamp only likes color
i donky ven have a gimmick
no species effects
a puppet that c s out of a box whoopee
weve got the moan fred
a listless anemic moan is heard through the p
thats the moan
thats what weve got fred
grandpa fred gamely goes back into character
oh renfield you want some lunch everybody
well pick it up right there
follow billy and fred as they walk through the lobby
you should run some of the classics fred ffankenstein dracula
all the great horror movies are in black and white
mister clamp only likes color
that guy is str
youve seen him
well of in person but just to this building
you know wha v t nd f tenants they have here
there esearch laboratory upat t tenet c research
foolin d with animals cutting thl
last week they took out a patent on a new kind of gerbil
people think ia creepy
well i wanted to get away from kingston falls
i guess i did
got that right kid
have you heard these voices they have here now
dont look at me like that
you know that white noise they play all the time
thats so they can put people close together and they wont overhear each other
youre not supposed to notice it
but if you listen to it there are little voices in there
you can almost hear what theyre saying but not really
thats a horror movie the building that wuldnt shut tln
revised july what would do that for
thats what th ids coming to kid
you cant talk to yourself without ebody interrupting
the clamp centres nerve center looks like an air traffic control tower technicians hunch over meters monitors and switches tracking the buildings systems
forster comes in and walks past several technicians looking over their shoulders
one computer monitor tracks the elevators movements while others give spy camera views of employees in corridors bathrooms etc
forster talks to a technician who mans controls labelled white noise and voice
let me hear the voices
the technician brings up voices on a speaker
they sound like voice overs on slick tv commercials
dynamic many im an honest kind of guy and not stealing office supplies works for me and e way i live today
when i save m the clamp organization i fe go about myself all over
brainy man you know ive been thinkin mister clamp would make a great president
thats fine to forster its for you sir
forster turns to see a technician pointing at a monitor showing clamps face
forster greets the screen
yes mister clamp
im going to a meeting about the vermont thing
it looks like that takeover is going to happen
thats terrific sir
how many guys do you know that have their own state
did i show you that picture of the mountains
while im in there get that revolving door fixed downstairs
it shorted out last night while i had some money people here
tanaka is still spinning
ill but a camp logo ills the monitor screen and clamps face disappe rs behipo it
forster turns and looks over a technicians shoulder at a monitor
a spy camera shows a stressed out employee lighting a cigarette in a storeroom
forster punches button on the cinsole picks up a microphone and talks into it thats an unaut iz pd break period pal
a dont work here anymore
on the monitor the startled employee looks around for the source of the voice
we have a problem communicating here
clean out the desk
thanks so much
he puts down the mike and moves on to lczgi
i aatiera t s sioul d
r p switch marked oxygen
what are you doing
indicates meters theres not much air in the building sir
at four oclock people go into a slump
then we give them oxygen yes air
with its cheerful wall sign reading splice o life inc
this reception area seems normal except for the animal noises that drift in from the back rooms
a messenger with a package finding no one at the rception desk goes past it into an inner corridor
to the fringe of a laboratory so high tech it makes the rest of the building look down home
as he looks into the lab peering curiously at scientists gadgets potted plants and caged animals his attention is captured by a sound from the back gizmos song in that
sad minor key
half consciously the messenger picks up the melody and starts whistling it to himself until peggy the labs receptionist comes over to his
can i help you
yeah got a delivery here
he follows her back to what kind of stuff do they do ft there anyway
were not supposed to talk about it
this is for doctor catheter
i can sign for it
peggys got a bad case of the sniffles she blows her nose as she signs the paperwork and hands it back
this copys yours
whistling gizmos tune again the messenger leaves the office almost running into dr
catheter splice o lifes chief scientist whos on his way in
doctor catheter this just came for you
taking package oh good
this might be my malaria
opening package no this is just rabies
i have rabies
and i was supposed to get the flu this week
i think the flu is on b eo order
she takes out a kleenex blows he z nose again
catheter holds his hand out
q may i have that peg oh uh sure
catheter takes the kleenex and heads for the inner office
shakes his head back order
all a man wants is some fresh germs
follow catheter back to in this closer look we see that many of the plants and animals in the lab are hooked up to mysterious gadgets
catheter goes over to wally a white coated scientist
the fluorescent lights over wallys area are flickering
your lights are flickering again
revised july wallys eyes are blinking in precise synch with the flickering of the fluorescent bulbs
catheter turns to a table where several different potted vegetable plants are att ed to collecting tubes that feed into a central glass vial
cafter how are we doing on a vegetable medley plant wally talked to the birds eye peopl ain
theyre very excited
wally nods sighing the long sgff ring researcher
we came close yesterday doctor
but it rejected the pimento
youll get it wally
im very pleased about this bat project though
he leads catheter toward a group of animal cages you know in some parts of the world there are millions of bats
they could make terrific messengers like pigeons
yes but they only come out at night
thats what were working on sir
they arrive at a cage where a resting bat hangs upside down
an intravenous tube sticking out of the bats flesh is connected to a drip bottle whose label bears a shining sun logo
this is a formula of vitamins hormones and french sunblock
soon hell be totally desensitized to bright light
watch revised july wally flips a switch and a bright sunlamp shines on the bat
the little creature stretches luxuriously warming itself in the rays like a basking cat
catheter draws closer to wally and speaks with creepy i believe sow them feed on
oh uh thats fferent bat doctor
well good work lly
catheter moves on
another scientist approaches wally in b
revised may i
wally could you let me have some growth hormone
im a little short
follow catheter to another side of the lab where two more scientists are at work
one of them lewis greets catheter while the other martin has his back to us at the moment
hows that cloning work coming
martin turns around
he is lewiss identical twin
r r e l well doctor
the twins talk in rapid e nation as if they share a brain
lewis t a say doctor look at i think youll find it interesting
following the sound of the crooning that caught the messengers attention they take catheter over to a lab table where the lights are lowered above a covered cage
martin pulls back the cloth to reveal gizmo who stops singing and looks up at them
some sort of rodent apparently
and it cant take bright light
watch this doctor
he opens the side door of gizmos cage and turns on a tape player
hearing the bouncy rock music gizmo playfully dances out of the cage as the scientists talk
qu te isnt he
that may be genetic
were not sure yet
but as he amuses his captors gizmo is slyly looking around for a way out of here
he edges farther away from the cage
not so fast pal
he abruptly switches the music off and grabs gizmo just before the mogwai can make good his escape
catheter sticks the frightened gizmo back in the cage and shuts the side door firmly
whats wrong with you two
he almost made a break for it
sorry sir how are you going to pro with him
vim cell samples tomorr tissue culture hursday
and then theres body structure
and for that my little friend
the three scientists loom over the terrified gizmo
catheter reaches into the cage to give gizmo a poke
well just have to cut you
billy in his cubicle stares at his chinatown drawing
just as he lowers pencil to paper the lights overhead go out
the worker in the next cubicle speaks up
you sat still for too long
the building thinks you left
its saving energy
billy jumps around and the lights come back on as the messenger who visited the genetics lab comes to the cubicle neighbors desk with a package
package for you
but as the cubicle neighbor signs thei p erwork the messenger whistles to himself gizmos song min in that sad minor
for a moment billy doesnt regis t and then camera catches the realization dawningqi s face as he looks over the cubicle partition and asks ijrlntly where did you heaa
where did you hear it
oh uh dah dah dah dah dah dah isnt that by sting
its not by sting
where did you oh hey i know
i was up in that laboratory you know on eighteen and somebody was like humming it
did you see who it was
nuh uh it was in the back billy takes off
peggy is sitting at the reception desk as billy comes in carrying a red toolbox
how you doin
i bear your copiers down
its back in ther
as the scientists work animals makb restless noises in their cages most of which are hidden by covering cloths
billy strolls in and starts fixing the copying machine removing parts at random as he whistles gizmos song
a moment later the melody comes b ek to him in gizmos croon from a corner where there are several covered cages
billy looks around the scientists are absorbed in their work
martin and lewis have clipped electrodes to the ears of a nervous looking rat
theyre preparing to throw the toggle switch of a strange looking device connected to the electrodes as dr
catheter looks on
this is the most interesting bio electrical work ive ever been involved in
here you go boy
he feeds the rat some liquid from a vial with a lightning bolt insignia on its label
think of it
millions of rats in new york and everyone hates them
but if one of them could power a portable radio for a month
he throws the switch
the rats eyes widen then calm down as the current goes off
catheter touches the rat and quickly pulls his hand back from the electric shock
definite progress fellows
if we could just make it safe to touch them
he wanders back to the corner zmos voice is coming from
two caged monkeys chatter at lm as he passes
billy whistling lifts the ctiver on the wrong cage
he drops it in shock as he gets a glimpse of a growth hormone experiment a hairy spidebout twelve inches across
then as gizmos singin news billys eyes fall on the right covered cage and theeaming scalpels arranged next to it
billy heads back to the copying machine
on the way he flips the latch on the monkeys cage and is back at the copier in time to look up surprised as the excited monkeys scamper past his
into the center of the lab distracting the scientists theodore
what are you doing out
put down that dna
as the scientists chase the monkeys billy hurries to gizmos cage
he opens the cage and his eyes meet gizmos its hard to say which of then is more excited
but the gala reunion will have to wait
billy scoops gizmo into his toolbox
he walks out of the lab leaving the copier a mess
walking faster now billy ducks into a mens bathroom whose wordless sign shows a little emblematic man holding a briefcase
billy goes through a small anteroom and a second door into the bathroom where he leans against the door catching his breath
billy goes through a small anteroom and a second door into the bathroom where he leans against the door catching his breath
he starts to lift the cover on the cage then remembers to turn the lights down
he lifts the cover a boy and his mogwai
emotions flood over their faces recognition relief shared secrets and memories
billy props the cage on a sink takes gizmo out
did you miss me
gizmo does eye movements shyly hedging then admitting it
yeah me too
lets put you up here
we dont want to get any water on you
twitterpg of strong agreement
s doing gizmo shrinks back terrified
that bad huh
how did you get in there
what happened to mister wing
gizmo looks sad indicates his armband
but then he stops at a sudden sound voices in the anteroom between the bathroom and the hail
quick get in here
he slips gizmo into the tool box above his protesting twitters
sshh just wait a minute revised may
billy sets about furiously washing his hands just as forster comes into the bathroom
billy doesnt see him standing there until he shakes water off his hands youre wetting my shoes peltzer
billy sees forster sees the shoes grabs a paper towel and is about to drop to his knees
im sorry sir let me stand up peltzer
come with me
billy grabs the tool box and follows forster out the door
as they go into the anteroom forsters clipboard carrying assistant joins them
with his assistant ar fi lly watching forster points to the sign on the bathroom d r
do you know what that eans peltzer
it means mens bathroom
what is the man holding
in the bathroom
on the sign peltzer
a little briefcase sir
because this is the executive washroom
i dont think you belong in there do you peltzer
my mistake revised may
forster whips the bar code reader wand out of his leatherette folder runs it over billys chest insignia again and pushes a button in the folder
a calculator type printout churns out of the gadget and forster looks it over
and these sat scores tries to see thats in there
forster snaps the folder shut
gizmo restless rattles the tool box
whats in the box peltzer
oh uh art supplies
ratt s box harder im mixin nts
well i better get back t here he backs down the hall th j ns and speeds up
hold on forster and his assistant w ing billy leave
i think our random drug search later on should be very interesting
jots on clipboard got it sir
billy returns to his cubicle the restless tool box still in hand
he opens a drawer in his desk slips gizmo inside
gizmo youve got to be quiet
you dont want to go back to that laboratory do you
muffled twitter of acquiescence
well go home soon and revised may billy is interrupted by someone gasping sharply beside him and he realizes that all noise and conversation around him have ceased
he quickly slams his desk drawer shut almost squashing gizmos paw and looks up to sef one staring as daniel clamp with two bodyguards walks do i e row of
no one can quite believe that the tyc on here in the flesh
revised may maria moves quickly to greet him and they meet beside billys cubicle
mister clamp sir im marla bloodstone im the department head here if theres anything i can thats okay

he grabs his sportcoat and follows maria toward the elevators
as they go camera holds on gizmos drawer
it slowly shakes i open and the curious mogwais eyes and ears come into view i checking out the world of billys office
gizmo ducks back out of sight
but a moment later a chain of large paper clips is tossed down from the drawer making a ladder to the floor
as gizmo starts hoisting himself over the edge of the drawer as billy and marla get off the elevators
uh could you excuse me a second

kate waits a moment then looks out into the lobby
lobby kates pov a i and sees billy leaving the building with marla
revised june a janitor pushing a cart of cleaning supplies comes into the office area
gizmo on the floor peeks around a corner to watch as the carts wheels rumble past him
as seen by gizmo the towering janitor stops at the departments water fountain and tries to get a drink
the fountains spigot overshoots giving the janitor a splash in the face
gizmo inches away from the source of the water and seeing a puddle on the carpet where the water landed carefully avoids it
he keeps moving and evades a second arc of errant water from the fountain
the janitor decides t gx the fountain
attacking the spigot with a wrench he sends off morq streams of water
to duck them gizmo takes cover back isu under billys desk
and doesnt see a big splash fo wezi hit billys chinatown picture
while gizmo thinking the danger is passed steps out from under the desk the bright colors of billys painting blur and the blob of water rolls down the illustration board
down the side of the desk
gizmo looks up but too late
from his pov the blob of paint tinted water is huge and coming down fast
it hits him and as the janitors feet and the wheels of his cart pass in a
camera holds on gizmo on the floor writhing in pain
the janitor leaves and gizmo screams as thwip
two tiny furballs shoot out of his body and land in the open drawer of a nearby filing cabinet
the painful mogwai replication continues and a third furball caroms off a drafting table and into a wastebasket
the fourth and final offspring shoots from gizmos body and as gizmo watches in horror and pain bounces crazily around the office area a little superball of fur
as gizmo sits up and looks up we watch with him four newborn mogwai hands reach out of the filing cabinet drawer gripping the top edge from inside
revised june camera moves in on the cabinet drawer and the first two new mogwais are revealed standing in the drawer george and lenny an inseparable pair
lenny is big dumb and loyal while george is small with a criminal caginess he gets lenny to do everything for him
gizmo watches the wastebasket where the third furball landed start to rock back and forth but is distracted as the bouncing furball hits the floor in front of him then
ricochets up onto a desktop
to sound fx of a bowling ball hitting the pins the furball rolls into a desk corner and the third mogwai unfolds upside down
this is daffy a dizzy uncontrollably antic mogwai with the demented juvenile joie de vivre we associate with the great daffy duck
in the first seconds following birth daffy goes daffy over the very fact of being alive
he sees his little hands and feet unfold
and gives a whoop waco
as gizmo watches the ra k n wa t basket tip over
looking into the basket we and gizmo se umble of office wastepaper which is violently toss e ut
until mohawk the fourth new mogwai emerges
this guy is pure malicious evil a new strain of badness
even as a furry mogwai hes about as cuddly as a cockroach
while daffy up on the desktop starts playing with everything in sight
mohawk on the floor moves in on gizmo
george and lenny drop down to the carpet to join mohawk as gizmo standing now backs away
theres a grated vent opening low on the wall behind him
lenny grabs gizmo with a fast moving paw and mohawk moving in close spits in gizmos eyes
through the glass window of billys cubicle we hear daffy acting up wa hogs
revised june and move in to see him putting wet paint paw prints all over the glass and the desk
george points to the vent opening behind gizmo and whispers to lenny
lenny nods his dumb understanding and yanks the force fit grate out of the wall
he clumsily bumps george with the grate and george slaps him
gizmo is tossed into the vent
and the grate is slammed back into place imprisoning him
the three mogwais tease him through the grate and leave
gizmo tries to push the grate back out but cant do it
gizmo looks out mi jra
bly though the vent
and camera pulls v tkfrom him to show the feet of departing humans who are oblivious to the strange imprisoned creature a few feet away
revised june w
a few late workers get on the elevator where billy and marla got off this morning
camera spots george lenny and mohawk hanging back in the shadow of anearby coffee station

forster and a security guard come down the rows of deserted cubicles
the guard has a mean looking dog straining on a leash sniffing at everything
as they near billys cubicle the dog starts sniffing excitedly
i knew wed find something in this guys desk but as they reach billys desk they find daffys paint paw prints tracking crazily over every surface
the dog keeps going bananas but its not drugs he smells its the dander of the recently departed daffy

unnoticed by passing people theyre digging the nighttime world of the lobby
kate walking toward bil s cubicle stops as she hears a piercing wolf whistle t her
she turns sharply looks around sees nobody until her eyes light on a nearp j cabinet where daffy hangs out of a drawer ogling her
gizmo howd you get up there
gizmo imprisoned in the vent sees kate mistaking daffy for him
he shakes his head twitters points to himself but hes too far away to get her attention
kate takes daffy out of the drawer but shes not happy about this especially when daffy leers at her
billy said to take you home
youd better stay in my purse till we get out of the building
revised v b continuedi b she slips his into the purse puts it over her shoulder
as gate heads for the exit an angle into her purse

a waiter appears at billys side holding a platter containing a large moose head sculpted out of chocolate
billy is so startled to find the moose staring at him that he spills his beer in his lap

kate has put daffy on the kitchen counter
nearby she unwraps some kentucky fried chicken
on the counter spot a few of rand peltzers seldom used kitchen inventions
billy said to make sure and feed you before midnight
as she arranges chicken and mashed potatoes on a plate daffy spots a blender next to him
he recoils from it then with an evil grin he shoves it off the counter while kates back is turned breaking it
when she turns and looks daffy has an innocent loops expression on his face
oh god you have to be careful here okay gizmo

daffy nods contritely

i dont know what billy sees in you
daffy whoops grabs more chicken and resumes eating
billy gets out of a taxi in front of the building and hurries inside
kate answers the doorbell
she undoes the deadbolts and opens the door
billy rushes in

he snatches a lean cuisine box away and grabs daffy almost getting bitten in the process
kate follows billy as he takes the flailing daffy into the living room and stuffs him into his leather daypack

the daypack jumps around wildly as billy zips it shut
you ever want to get out of there you better relax
daffy settles down to a low rumble
they grab their coats start toward the door

it was just one of those business things

as yogurt jerk joins the discussion a new angle finds a furry paw turning on two spigots on the yogurt machine

hidden from view by the counter mohawk george and lenny reach for the trickling yogurt
check the lobby clock as the time ticks past midnight

shes about to turn them off but a complaining customer stops her

cus tt me im telling you thing in the trail i dont just want a different yogurt i want d akrxes to customer what kind of thing was in the

billy checks the lobby clock
he pulls kate aside
its after midnight and theyve eaten
now theyll make their cocoons
and if they get to water come on
she leads him quickly over to the elevators
six stories underground beneath the building and its parking floors
yellow lamps set in a concrete wall along a catwalk ledge cast an eerie half light on kate and billy
its along here
they come to a deep square recess in the wall
inside is massive machinery pipes pumps meters surrounded by a this is where the water comes into the building
maybe if we shut it off theyll even close the place down
billy goes to a corner of the chain link cage and starts bending links back from the seam trying to make a big enough opening to slip through
one of the technicians gets a beep from his terminal
the night time supervisor comes and looks over his shoulder at the monitor which shows a blinking red diagram of the basement water machinery
give me video
the technician types a command and a video image of billy attacking the cage appears on the screen
billy and kate have opened a sea of the cage
kate stands clear as billy tries to pull the
de back but a bright light hits his eyes l back off
put your hds up
billy backs off the cage and ss a guard coming toward him flashlight and gun in hand
as he gets close daffy starts bouncing around in the daypaelr again
the guard trains his gun on the leather bag
whats in the bag pal
lets have a look
you dont want to the guard ignores him opens the zipper and looks down into the bag
when the guard pulls his head up daffy is hanging onto the guards nose by his teeth
the guard flails his head furiously around until daffy finally flies free no
and as the mogwais departing footsteps are heard the guard angrily puts billy up against the wall starts handcuffing him
we have to find him before he eats something guard b indicates his nose he already ate some i billy looks around for kate then realizes shes hiding in the
shadows of the concrete recess unnoticed by the guard
look we have to shut this building down
that thing that bit you there are more of them okay
and theyre going to turn into these monsters and tell you what pal you can tell the cops all about these monsters im sure theyll be very interested
as he takes billy away camera holds on a spot over their heads
goes into a gap between the concrete wall and ceiling
and finds three big cocoons
their slimy bodies gleam dully in the yellow lamplight
as we watch the cocoons silently grow and change gathering strength
listen im not crazy
people are going to be in a lot of danger
they wreck things
they kill people
if they get out of here theyll destroy the whole city
theyll destroy everything
listen to me
a midtown precinct house
as billy and rate hurry out the front door policemen in b
are leading a group of arrested street mimes from a paddy wagon toward the station
though in custody the mimes continue their portrayals of walking against the wind feeling up invisible wall etc
thanks for getting a e out of there
it was easy i just gave them a next months rent
when we get there go to your job like normal okay
and just keep your eyes open
what time is it
they hit the early scorning at a run
the early morning arrivals are here people opening their lobby businesses
in a series of shots they lift the shiny corrugated metal security gates that protect a newsstand
an under the building the mogwais slimy cocoons begin to burst open with acrid smoke swirling around them
the gates lift up on the tannin salon
the hair cutting as more cocoons burst open
gizmo edges forward in the dark vent passageway revised may
and doesnt see the floor disappear from under him until hes already falling down a tall vertical drop grasping helplessly at the sheer wall that rushes past
until he lands on something soft and rolls off onto a hard concrete floor
he looks at what he landed on its one of the cocoons in the basement wall crevice
as gizmo backs away the cocoon belches smoke opening up
gizmo wide eyed knows who to warn bil lee but a green claw grabs him from behind jerking him backward off his feet
billy and kate come breathlessly through the lobby doors
they find the businesses mostly open and a sea of people pouring through the doors innocently arriving for work
billy what if theyre already suddenly the lobby lights dim d billy looks up
he starts leading kate toward e lobby newsstand
on the way they run into grandpa fred
grandpa i ed hey billy the buildings completely screwe p today hurrying on fred

he hands kate a couple of flashlights as they start back across the lobby

continu edi shes out of earshot
as billy heads for the elevators hold on a nearby millers outpost jeans store that opens onto the lobby
a couple of teenage girl shoppers approach the sales clerk
do you have any styles that arent urn fringed
they hold up several pairs of pants
all of them are fringed from the knees down as if theyd been clawed to tatters
from the stores back room we hear a whoop
its familiar but the voice has become deep raspy and such less innocent
billy comes in to find forstez kking his morning rounds among the technicians
mister forster i i
forster zs peltzer

he starts to walk away but billy follows his

looking around apprehensively kate leads her tour group into the clamp cable tv operation
among her charges today is katsuji a year old japanese tourist
katsuji is loaded down with an amazing arsenal of photography equipment half a dozen still cameras with a ton of lenses and a video camcorder
photographing the hell out of everything he falls behind kate and the group
sir im sorry but you have to keep up with the rest of the group
katsuji responds by zooming in on kate with the video camera
please give me some right profile as you continue speaking
uh if were very quiet we can go in here and watch a program being videotaped
as kate and her tourists quietly file into the studio marges cameraman tracks her to a counter where she puts a tray of canapes down beside a casserole
now this week here on microwave with marge is our special salute to luncheon meats and im very excited about t ecipes so lets just jump k ome hors doeuvres
you kn t logna and bean dip roll ups a is when friends drop over and f i o want to make it a little extra special you can get
some of these little sword shaped toothpicks you put that through the bologna and thats your viva zapata appetizer
people are simply crazy about these
as forster fumes the systems control technicians have an amused discussion of the gremlin rules as explained by billy
okay wait what if one of them eats something at eleven oclock but he gets something stuck in his teeth a caraway seed
whatever right and then after twelve oclock it comes out now he didnt eat that after midnight look i didnt make the rules
there are the rules
i cant believe this
or what about if hes eating in an airplane and they cross the time zone but the technicians theory is cut short as two green arms burst out of his
console ripping aside control buttons and speaker grilles in a burst of sparks and before the technician can move the arms are going for his throat and mohawk now a bloodthirsty gremlin emerges from the wreckage of the console still choking the technician
help me at the sight of mohawii rster jumps back
technician tries to move on the gremli o awk takes a claw from his victims neck and slashes a ian s arm driving him back
billy pulls out his building shag plight and shines it at the gremlin
recoiling the gremlin s go of the technician who falls to the floor dead
as kate and her tourists watch marge stirs an enormous institutional size soup pot on a kitchen stove
this is how we used to cook for big groups before we had our microwave ovens and the other modern appliances
it would take days to plan the menu and hours over a hot stove to do the cooking
but now we can make this same tuna noodle cheez product chowder surprise in just a few minutes and you can feed anything from a high school reunion to a
complete chain gang with this kind of quantity
marge puts a lid on the soup pot
now if we step over here
but as she starts to turn away the lights on the set suddenly huh
brownout or something
marge hears a tapping noise from inside the soup pot
confused she lifts the lid and jumps back as lenny now a gremlin but his dopey face still recognizable sits up in the soup pot wearing a chefs hat and
splatters marge with orange noodle casserole goo
he whips out a turkey easter and squirts marge with it
at the sound of gremli laughter she wheels to see george a gremlin in an apron counter behind her
as marge turns to the cameraman for pr tl george points to two microwave ovens at the rear of the set
mi cro wave
kates tourists turn to flee the studio the last to go is katsuji who photographs the gremlins a mile a minute as he backs out of the room
as the tourists go the gremlins turn savagely toward the ovens
george whispers to lenny who nods obediently and throws several metal utensils into the microwaves
the gremlins close the ovens and start them up
the ovens fill with furious arcs of blue light look out
and the ovens explode showering the set with glass
as marge and her cameraman escape the studio the ovens catch fire
the flames lick up toward the ceiling and set off the sprinklers
george and lenny grin standing tall to shower in the spray
as the water hits bubbles appear on the gremlins backs
close on the bubbles camera finds the tiny heads of gremlin offspring getting ready to burst out
as the studio fills with the ominous smoke and colored light of gremlin multiplication kate runs from the room
revised june as the sound of a xerox machine in operation is heard o
camera is close on the floor of a copying and office supply room where a series of photocopies is piling up
the pictures are of gizmo his body pinned down his face contorted in pain
each pose is slightly more tortured than the one before
new angle finds gizmo in the flesh hes fastened by a web of scotch tape to the document cover of a big copier
as gizmo struggles helplessly re l mohawk at the controls setting the machine for copies
gizmo slides over the glas s ga i d again wincing as hes hit by painful bursts of bright lag revised may
in the wake of mohawks attack the technicians are both somber and rattled
they work urgently at their consoles as a panicked forster paces behind them looking at their monitor screens
mister forster i show lighting brownouts in five locations
ive got a climate control malfunction floors fifteen and sixteen what the hells going on
uh air forster goes over to technician s station points to screen the peat infestation monitor
and sees on the technicians screen an alarmingly rapid proliferation of dots spreading over the diagram of the building
the dots started as a cluster in the cable tv studio area microwave marges studio but theyre spreading out to other floors and moving around quickly
forster is what is that
that at rats is it
no sir im afraid s not a videophone rings near technician he grabs it
techni aaon systems control kates face fills the videci hone screen
is billy peltier there please
revised may a continueds a no he said he was going to mister clamps office hey do you know anything about thank you
she hangs up runs toward the elevator and gets on
as the doors close kate breathlessly asks the elevator for thirty eight
but the voice that croaks back isnt the usual elevator voice
kates face registers she jams on the door open button but the door stay and the elevator starts before it jerks to a sudden stop clamps office is huge immaculate
and fully outfitted with high tech gadgets
the window looks down on a bank of clouds pierced by the tips of new york landmarks the chrysler building etc
clamp hits the switch on a desk intercom
have you shredded my mail from this morning
over intercom im just finishing mister clamp
lets do some memos
as he talks clamp goes over to a bank of video monitors on his wall
some of them display spy camera views around the building while others are tuned to clamp cable channels
one of these catches clamps eye its showing its a wonderful life in black and white
merry christmas movie house
merry christmas drugstore
scowling clamp pushes a button
the movie blossoms into garish unlifelike color
clamps secretary pushes the last of his mornings mail into the shredder beside her desk its a letter bearing the seal of the vice president of the united states and
starting thank you for your generous contribution
as the letter turns into paper spaghetti the secretary leaves the shredder on turns to her computer and starts typing down clamps dictation
spot her prim pink sweater hanging on the back of her chair
over i f first one to gefjq public relations
h e people in chinatown give a st a tival as a spontaneous outpouri appreciation for what ive ne for their community
the secretary takes a hurried bite of a sandwich then goes back to her typing
but camera holds on the sandwich as the green claws of an otherwise o
gremlin slip a spring loaded mousetrap under the top slice of bread
the claws withdraw from sight just as the secretary turns to pick up the sandwich again
she takes a bite and though her back is to us we hear the snap of the mousetrap and the secretarys scream which clamp also hears over the intercom
he rushes into the outer office where he finds the gremlin wearing the secretarys pink sweater sitting in her chair and typing at her computer
youre not my secretary
the gremlin responds by grabbing a silex pot of boiling hot water from the nearby coffee station and flinging the boiling water at clamp who ducks it as it scalds
the paint on the wall behind him
clamp makes a tentative move toward the gremlin who throws the empty silex
it barely misses clamp and smashes against the wall
the gremlin jumps at clamp who tries to bat it away from his face like a kid panicked by a moth but his flailing knocks the gremlin back so that
its foot is caught in the hopper of the secretarys shredder
hating to do it using only his fingertips clamp pushes the struggling gremlin down into the machine which sprays him out of the bottom like a black bloody eyes only
memo of deatu
as clamp stands gasping ade the machine the door to the corridor opens and billlybu in
he sees the shredder and the tattered gremlin remaips j ng from it
sir are you all right
i think so

well um you know that genetics laboratory down on of course
to forster i warned you that could be a problem tenant
we could have had three shrinks and a plastic surgeon in that space
kates elevator still str d between floors begins to rock violently
kate jams on ten alarm button but the only sound she hears is that of countless claws outside pounding and scraping at the elevator car
the automated elevator voice talks on through the chaos
you have requested a floor that is not part of the building at this time
and now kate sees claws tearing at the corners of the elevator car trying to gouge their way inside
sound of gremlin laughter echoes in the elevator shaft
kate shrinks into the middle of the floor her hands braced against the walls daffy is now a gremlin wearing an engineers hardhat and a workshirt with daffy stitched on
hes at an elevator control panel with floor number indicators etc
as he randomly hits buttons and turns dials meters shoot into danger zones and red lights blink ominously
the elevator falls fast toward us
the gremlins hanging on the bottom of the elevator car realize that its curtains but its too late for them to do anything about it but then the elevator stops
moving and kate regains her balance inside until daffy pushes one last button and the control panel and the elevator start alling again racing down the last few floors to the bottom
ust before impact the face of a screaming gremlin fills gr frame i tnt
parking vestibule two suburban ladies wall a bank of elevator doors from the o
there are some nice shops here in the building
on landing black gremlin blood splatters kate as it gushes in through the shattering floorboards
and the force of the fall throws the elevator doors open so that the suburban ladies are suddenly face to face with the trembling blood soaked kate
indicates other well get the next one
where the argument is still going on sir we have to make sure that none of these things get wet
if that happens ill tell you what we have to do
we have to get a lid on this thing and keep it on
no cops no media
well handle it
to forster go down to systems control and get on top of this thing
um but there might be revised april
my vegetable medley
before wally can stop him a gremlin goes over to the potted vegetable plants with tubes connecting them to a glass vial
he grabs the vial eats it
and stands still for a moment
as his ears turn into leafy clumps of romaine lettuce
wally tries to move on him but the gremlin menaces his with a claw and goes on to grab a vial from a cauliflower plant
chaos ensues as more gremlins go after more vials and the scientists efforts to stop them result mainly in trashed angle on a gremlin trying a vial marked sex hormone
the gremlins face registers big consumer satisfaction he downs the rest of the vial in one gulp
i v my god
as the labs chief researcher stands in the doorway unable to believe his eyes another gremlin grabs a vial attached to a brain that site in a tank of saline
not the brain hormone
the gremlin swallows the vial
twitches for a moment
he painfully croaks out a few words i
to then suddenly the transformation takes hold in thrashing jekyll and hyde histrionics that send the gremlin rolling on the floor
when he stands he wears a pair of horn rimmed glasses and speaks fluently in a new voice similar to that of revised july
talk a little bit about whats going on in this room because i think there are some fascinating ramifications here for the future
when you introduce genetic material of research quality to a life form such as ours which is possessed of a sort of i hesitateto use the word atavism but let
us say a highly aggressive nature
the other gremlins instantly bored with this guy grab more vials and start turning animals loose from their cages as the scientists try in vain to op them
for example at fellow over near the i believ n a common bat of the order the only mammals i mig add capable of true flight
indeed a gremlin is approaching cage of the bat whos being desensitized to light for messenge ing purposes
the gremlin grabs a collecting vial connected by surgical tubing to the bats body
the gremlin swallows the vial then stands watching surprised as his hands become webbed like bat wings
while this is happening the brain gremlin walks over to the bat gremlin
might i have a brief word with you
the t qrenlin looks curiously at him
my friend you have
i want to help you be all that you can be
as he continues talking he plucks the intravenous tube from the bats body and happily jams the needle into the
bat gremlins skin
the bottle with the sunshine logo on it drains quickly
revised july as im su oure aware sunlight poses a prk cklks for our
we nit tan we dont burn frankly west become a rather unappetizing a of photochemical leftover
thus is formula
specia y designed for those of the noctu a persuasion
to mak right light no problem whatever
that will be of crucial usefulness where youll be going
the brain gremlin yanks the iv needle from the bat gremlins skin
the bat gremlins expression asks where ill be going
you have wings my friend
the bat gremlin does and takes off soaring near the ceiling as the twin scientists chase
to bat gremlin to the window my friend
a world of possibilities opens itself to you
throw off the old constraints
the bat gremlin wings toward one of the polarized glass windows
there it is
the city so nice they named it twice
check it out one time wont you
and smashes through it leaving a jagged bat silhouette in the glass behind him
the other gremlins shrink from the invading rays of sunlight but the bat gremlin flies free
soaring into the sky above new york
a pigeon perches on a stone statue with which pigeons have been well acquainted
sunning himself hes surprised as plop
a glob of green goo hits him on the head
i i omit the threadbare horror host is taping again
he blows some prop dust off a reel of film
tonight weve got a classic horror movie from grandpa freds special dungeon fred is interrupted by a moan not the normal weak moan on the tape but a genuinely scary
he turns around and sees a grinning gremlin emerge from behind the prop tombstone
as fred heads back there two other gremlins join the first one and the three of them watch him intently
fred whats the story with those things
one of the gremlins takes the reel of film from fred unreels a little from the loose end and holds it up
a second gremlin looks at a frame mimes terrified shock then clutches his chest and falls back onto the floor
the of e
uh that s right it s real scary the other two gremlins put their f alongside freds and make scary snarls
they like it here boy thats creepy
uh grandpa fred and his friends have something horrible in store for you tonight
the gremlins nod in gleeful agreement
a few people are drinking here but they pay little notice to the newscaster on the tv set over the bar
of major mechanical problems today at the clamp centre office i building
reached by hotline news a spokesman for developer daniel clamp says theres nothing to worry about that these are just the normal glitches that a new building goes through in
the first few months
turning to sports
salad bar customers are heaping their plates
my broker a g s the strongest things in the ecb i f ght now are cigarette a np s magazines
iry of course hes been in jail for a while now
customer reaches under the salad bars sneeze guard with the plastic tongs to pull a clump of lettuce from the bin and is horrified to discover that he is holding
an all vegetable mutant gremlin by the ear
this horribly smiling thing has radishes for eyes corn row hair cauliflower ears stringbean lips and as it opens its mouth a darting wax pepper tongue
as other customers recoil horrified customer tries to drop the vege gremlin but baring its sharp artichoke teeth it reaches out with carrot fingers to grab his shirt and pull
his through the sneeze guard
in a clamp cable tv studio leonard maltin is taping an at the movies type show called the movie police
and now for our videocassette consumer watch he gingerly holds up a videocassette of the first gr gmlins movie as if it is a long dead fish
revised may heres one thats just been re released on video and if youre thinking of renting it i can think of a lot of better things to do with
leonard is unaware of the real gremlins that have snuck into the studio and are creeping up on him from behind such as burning them
in fact burning this movie wouldnt be a bad the gremlins attack savagely clawing at leonard who quickly goes down out of view except for his flailing hands
look two thuulbs ui hhhhhhh
lobby angle stock broi erai a in the clamp centre lobbys small stock brokerage office a broker in a power tie is working his phones when he finds a gremlin
on his desk staring at him
into phone what
think about those bonds

the broker starts yanking the tie off but the gremlin swipes at him and he beats it as wider angle reveals a number of other gremlins also chasing brokers off
and grabbing their phones variously on phones buy

revised may yes id say its a full scale panic
are you having a run on the banks there yet
well its rather brutal here
were advising our clients to put everything theyve got into canned food and shotguns
the ticker display on the wall speeds up going nuts
people whove seen the invading gremlins start fleeing through the front doors
kate bruised haggard jvsplattered with gremlin blood makes it upstairs to a stairwe or and opens it revised may to find a scene of building mayhem in the lobby
as panicking people try to flee the swarming gremlins camera surveys the carnage from kates pov gremlins at the frozen yogurt stand shoot streams of whipped cream at fleeing workers
a bartender his body covered with gremlins falls to the floor trying to shake them loose
at the salad bar the all vegetable gremlin terrifies fleeing people with his freakish face
a woman screams and ducks as a gremli swings toward her on a sparking electric cable torn from the ceiling
people desperately scramble toward the exit doors but the lobby is becoming an obstacle course of rubble as the gremlins trash it
kate takes momentary cover behind a pillar gathering her nerve then makes a break a ss the lobby running for a fire alarm on the back wall
as a ches it a raincoat wearing flasher gremlin blocks her way a li ks open his coat to flaunt his reptilian underbelly
kate kicks the flasher gremlin out ofbf k way and pulls the alarm
in the clamp centre of coot the fire alarm isnt some old fashioned bell or siren
instead melodramatic music builds under a documentary narrator voice fire
the untamed element
oldest of mans mysteries
workers in an upstairs corridor as yet unreached by the gremlin invasion stop to listen to the p
giver of warmth destroyer of forests
right now this bu i d ing is on fire
yes the building is on fire
leave the building
enact the age old drama of self preservation
people from officesstart beating it toward the stairwell exit
futterman dressed for sightseeing arrive at the handsome old cathedral of saint eva marie
spot a construction crew repairing the sidewalk in front of the cathedral
oh murray what a beautiful building
looks like somethin out of the dark ages
true saint eva maries architecture is on the vy side
as camera notices the ornate windows and the cor te topped with spooky stone gargoyles i wait a minute
that one there
thats i a rgoyle
futterman c qi i what is it murray
its the flying bat gremlin and it leaves its perch to fly hey
he flails at the gremlin batting it away from him but it keeps coming back as sheila stands back too terrified to move murray what is it
to pedestrians help me
somebody help me
but the new yorkers on the sidewalk continue past him oblivious
futterman grapples with the greml trying to get hold of its slashing claws
his face is cut and his wrist
wt he grabs hold of one claw then the other and manages to fling the struggling gremlin away from him so that it tumbles off balance into the constr ion
crews churning cement mixer as sheila rushes to murrays side the f tng gremlin emerges from the cement mixers thick whirlpool coated with ray cement
murray braces for another attack but the cement weighs th emlin down so much that all it can do is flap its wings slowly lofting pa ully toward the cathedral
as the cement starts hardening and as the gremlin regains his perch the cement solidifies so that he is now a gargoyle for real and for good
futterman catches his breath and takes off running
murray where are you going
we have to tell billy
sheila follows him
people from offices are fleeing the fire
billy and forster hurrying toward the systems control center almost trip over a number of escaped lad animals who are fleeing down the w
the animals are followed by the breathless dr
catheter who is hurrying even faster
catheters mind has apparently snapped
they fought back that s what
stuff he grabs billys shirt
i swear to god
i will never
hurt is anything again
they are all part of the great chain of being
there are things that man
was not meant to splice
revised july the hell is he talking about
try and calm down where were the but as billy tries to understand dr
catheter our frame starts to jitter a heres something wrong with the projector
then the film freezes caught in the gate
a burn spot appears consuming the image of bill aasd the others
the frame fills with white light and we hear a flapping nd as if the reel were spinning uselessly in the projector
in the stereo surrounds we begin to hear t
i i ound of o
gremlin silhouettes appear on a screen making shadow bunnies with their claws competing for space hitting and shoving each other
the frame is filled by a grainy black and white title card reading sun a mother shields her pre teen daughters eyes from the offscreen sun worshipers as the rest
of the audience gasps
she drags her child from her seat
lofly our theater the mother storms out of the auditorium and accosts the beleaguered looking i cant believe it
this is worse than the first one
a man covered with film obviously the projectionist staggers up to the manager
his clothes are in tatters

a man who has been getting popcorn at the nearby candy counter turns and comes over to the group
he is steven spielberg
what seems to be the trouble here

they refuse to run the rest of the picture
they want to see snow white oral thg
i knew i should have directed this one myself
beckons across lobby hulk
hulk hogan in full wrestling regalia and carrying raisinets comes over to join spielberg
spielberg points a finger upward toward the projection booth in our theater
hogan quickly grasping the situation addresses the gremlins in the booth

and our film resumes in a new setting the clamp cable network control booth
grandpa fred comes into the control room to find multiple monitors showing the signals of several new york tv stations to a deserted room
as fred watches pan three monitors showing newspeople in front of
the clamp centre building
the scene behind the newspeople is chaos police barricades refugees from the building a curious crowd etc
many conflicting reports from people whove come out of the building
stories about a fire but also reports of an attack by some sort of animals again none of this is confirmed
people who are quite hysterical talking about some sort of green men unfortunately police are not permitting any news media into the building at this time so were unable to
bring you first hand coverage but as soon as
freds face registers what hes thinking this is it
he runs out into the corridor
where katsuji the camera happtourist from kates tour group is fleeing down the hall om some fresh disaster
can you work a tv camera
katsuji smiles proudly
work a camera
i master the camera
oblivious to the chaos in the rest of the building marla is trying to work in her darkened office reading paste up boards with a match
a screaming catastrophe holocaust murder deadline emergency rush and theres no e lights
angrily she picks up the receiver of her video phone
the little screen fills with a card reading please stand bym great
she hangs up goes back to work
from the lobby toy store we hear the noise of gremlin laughter and clattering machinery
on a big model train dis phawk and a bunch of his hench gremlins are torturing gizm m d ed in engineers hats the gremlins have tied the helples
s rh to the tracks
as a vicious ionel bears down on gizmo v a l billy and forster follow dr
catheter in to find a riot of gremlins bingeing on genetic elixirs and trashing lab equipment
forster is quickly waylaid by the gremlin who drank the sex hormone earlier and has become a mutant amorous girl gremlin with blonde hair and big red lips
she develops an instant crush on forster her heart pounding half out of her chest
the girl gremlin jumps up onto forsters chest embraces his neck and moves in for a kiss
get it off me but dr
catheter is rushing to a cabinet at the back of the lab
ive got some small assault weapons
while billy sees a gremlin eat the lightning bolt vial that was injected into the rat earlier
the gremlin shudders through the reaction but seems not to change
until he spots an electric socket and touches his claw to it
the gremlin disappears into the socket as if swallowed by it
as forster backs out of the room the girl gremlin now hanging on fiercely to his leg
catheter in b
screams as he takes his arm out of the cabinet with a gremlin attached by the teeth
trying to shake it off catheter goes tripping through the wrecked lab crashing into equipment
now a number of other gremlins see the scientist on the defensive and pile onto his sending him stumbling to the floor
f x i and billys attention is qught by mohawk whos zeroing in on the cage containing the lve inch spider that billy saw earlier
a surgical tube rtm s from the hairy spiders body to a small glass vial with a spr logo on it
billy moves to stop mohawk i i
but now the gremlin w hrftd isappeared into the electric outlet emerges from another soc across the room
he is different now seemingly made of e crackling electricity
he flies close to billy forcing to back away so that mohawk can grab the vial attached to the spider and escape from the lab
finished with billy the electric gremlin wafts himself onto a table full of scientific machinery
he touches his glowing claw to a cyclotron
it spins crazily then shorts out in a shower of sparks and smoke
while on the floor below the gremlin mob finishes off dr
the tycoon is talking on the phone just tell then everythings under control weve just had a few clamp stops as he sees a wall monitor with a clamp news
network sign under it
grandpa fred stands amid the lobby carnage covered by katsujis slightly jerky hand held camera clamp whitening flicks the sound on
revised may this invasion by strange creatures perhaps from another galaxy
or a dimensional warp
as fred speaks katsujis camera catches a fast glimpse of gremlins in kids clothes frolicking past in b
its hard for fred to shake his horror movie training revised may
and just a moment ago in a spine t
ing blood chilling incident catches himself turns newsy uh they continue to plague this troubled structure throughout what has been a turbulent and tumultuous afternoon
as the crowd builds outside the building one of the frustrated tv newspeople argues with a cop
look just let us in there
well take the responsibility forget it pal
most of the people are out of there ow anyway
then whats in ther been in beirut yeah
i bet they miss you there
to crowd lets move back folks
in the same xerox room where he was tormented with the copying machine and the rubber cement gizmo is undergoing his worst torture yet at the hands of george and
mohawk who have lit censers and put on inquisition style robes for the occasion
the defenseless gizmo is tied with heavy twine to the top of a paper cutting table
above him george hangs by one arm from a high shelf
in his other claw george holds a pendulum rigged up from a t square a protractor rubber bands
revised may and a gleaming sharp ex acto knife
as george swings the pendulum the knife blade moves closer to gizmos chest a fraction of an inch each time
pacing back and forth on the floor below mohawk cackles at gizmos dilemma
like a villain swilling whiskey he gulps from the vial he stole in the genetics lab the one with the spider logo on it
the blade moves closer grazing gizmos fur
but as it slices the topmost fibers of the twine that holds him down a change comes over gizmos expression
this is one mogwai whos had enough
he sets his jaw in angry determination and bursts the frayed twine freeing one arm then another george grabs the t square like a scythe and tries to hack at
gizmo with the knife blade but gizmo grabs the pendulum and pulls down hard so that george tumbles from his shelf and lands on mohawk
before the gremlins can get to their feet gizmo scrambles down from the table and runs into the corrido g mohawks grabbing claw making for freedom
two fire engines have pulled up outside the building
as firemen connect their hoses to hydrants cops push the crowd back to clear a path to the door for the firemen
as the breathless futtermans arrive at the building they see a tv newsperson interviewing the nearly hysterical microwave marge beside the door
forster stumbles backward but the electric gremlin jumps at him and at its touch forsters body too is covered by electricity
he writhes in the grasp of the power and finally throws the gremlin off
as the electric gremlin disappears into a socket forster reels backward dazed stumbling
his hair is on end his eyebrows charred and hes knocking over furniture
hes alive he just doesnt know what planet hes on

billy comes into clamps office to find the tycoon pacing nervously
bill hows it going out there
just tell me theres progress
im afraid its pretty bad right now sir bad
there are people in this building
you have any idea what kind of lawsuits were looking at here
well have to but as he speaks the electric gremlin emerges from a wall socket behind clamp
p i clamp turns to see the electric gremlin glide swims y through the air coming straight at him help billy grabs the receiver of a video phone end steps
between clamp and the electric gremlin
at the last possible instant he holds the receiver up in the electric gremlins path
the glowing beast touches the mouthpiece
and shows up an instant later on the video phones screen trapped writhing in pain as recorded voices bounce around it and issue from the phones speaker
if you want to make a call please hang up and try again
were sorry all circuits are busy now
hes in the phone system
that should take care of him for a while
while waiting we invite you to listen to a brief interlude of recorded music
the music begins a cheery muzak rendition of raindrops keep wallin on my head
the electric gremlin writhes more fiercely his pain doubled
uh bill thanks
mister clamp we have to stop these things from leaving the building
if they get out thats it for new york at least new york
clamp nods gravely and takes a videocassette from a drawer
i thought this would never run bill but maybe it will
what is it
the sign off
the b sign off he puts the tape into a vcr head under bis wall monitors
several monitors fill with a montage t images beauty shots of animals sunsets beaches
because of the end of civilization the clamp cable network now leaves the air
we hope you have enjoyed our programming but more important we hope you have enjoyed life
as the montage continues a tiffany type pop singer sings a sprightly version of an old hymn yet in my dreams i be nearer my god to thee
clamp watching wipes away a tear
its beautiful isnt it
yes listen sir can you set the clocks in the building ahead three hours
all of them
bill theres nothing we cant do in this building
sunlight kills these things
thats why theyre still in here
but when its sundown or when they think it is theyll all get together in one place so they can go out
theyll all be in the lobby
thats the only way out the front doors
he takes out a pocket computer scheduler c pushes a few buttons
i clamp cong
the sun sets at seven twenty five
so around four twenty just before they try to leave thats when we can make our move
i like that
theyre off balance weve got information they dont thats when you can really take someone out
its just an idea
youll have to set it up
from outside the building if you can get out there
yeah ive got my own entrance
you should get out too
theres some things i still have to take care of in here
this idea of yours yeah
its going to be tricky
but if it works you could save the city
save the city
developer saves city
walking down a din corridor marla calls out indignantly isnt anybody around here
i nee light in my suddenly marla is startled by a booming amplified voice the subliminal tapes from the systems control center jacked up to more than audible volume
not stealing office supplies works for me and the way i live today
mister clamp is it true the buildings been evacuated
sir is the building on fire
no no signals firemen thats a false alarm
weve just got some problems problems
youve got a guy in a dracula costume in there broadcasting stuff with little green monsters

as the media mob follows clamp ac s the street mr
futterman pushes the other way toward clam sidewalk elevator
a couple of people notice murray
futterman pushes the button and hes below street level before anyone can catch bin
in the wrecked control center lenny browses the console looking for buttons that still work and jamming on them at random
he hits a few sliders in a bank marked climate and as billy moves quickly down a corridor searching
revised may kate
a wind storm comes out of the vents
papers from nearby offices swirl into the corridor
as billy bats the flying memos away and struggles against the wind he hears a noise in a nearby office and goes inside to investigate
a dentists reception area full of cheery pro flossing posters
camera follows billys cautiously moving shadow on the wall where its suddenly joined by the shadow of a gremlin daffy
seen in shadows the gremlin whacks billy over the head with a frying pan
as billys shadow swoons to the floor revised april
a hastily abandoned office somewhere in the building
gizmo is on the desktop rummaging in the open top drawer
with a quiet stern determination we havent seen in him before he gathers up a few things a rubber band
a wooden match
and a paper clip which he starts to straighten
as gizmo works pan to a digital desk clock
its numbers flash ahead three hours
the big lobby clock is also moving ahead three hours
pan down to the bar where a number of gremlins are drinking and enjoying the broadcast on the tv set behind the bar
the tv screen shows grandpa fred in a cable tv studio with a donahue or geraidq type talk show set up getting ready to interview the brain hormone gremlin
i b in an even more bizar t that one of the ores creatures is that i u ate
the brain gremlin nods
grandpa fred and the brain gremlin in the studio where katsuji is working the big floor model camera
who is able to talk and hes going to talk with us now
to brain gremlin i think the main question people have is what is it you want
the brain gremlin answers in his usual cultured tones sounding lucid
fred what we want is i think what everyone wants and what you and your viewers have civilization revised may the drinking gremlins nod agreement pound beer mugs on the
bar for emphasis
the niceties fred
the fine points
standards manners tradition
thats what were reaching toward
oh we may stumble along the way but civilization yes
the geneva convention
everything your society has worked so hard to accomplish over the centuiries thats what we aspire to
we want to be civilized
i mean you take a look at this fellow here
on tv a dopey looking gremlin wanders into frame grinning stupidly waving at freds o
the brain gremlin reaches out of frame comes back with a gun and shoots the dopey gremlin
the bar gremlins love it
now was that civilized
i fun but in no sense civilized
on tv fred starts backing nervously away from the armed gremlin
uh of course that could be argued different ways
as the bar gremlins live it up va e pans to the front doors of the building
unnoticed by the grem in scene outside the front doors of the building has changed
it now apa be red square at night in the s
as the crowd watches workers with cranes position a cloth theatrical backdrop the red square scene in front of the doors
a little to the left
a fire chief climbs down from an idled hook and ladder and comes over to clamp
whats this thing for
b continueds b these things can only come out when its dark
weve put all the clocks in the building ahead three hours
when they think its sunset
and they see what a nice night it is outside
theyll all be in the lobby getting ready to come out
when they do we drop this backdrop
and let the sunlight fry em
indicates backdrop whered you find this thing
its from a musical i was backing on broadway
the one about stalin

we want the essentials fred
complete bedroom groups
convenient credit even if weve been turned down in the past
fred am i losing you here
billy is blinking himself groggily to consciousness seeing the room through the blur of concussion
theres an unpleasant whining noise as billy sees daffy now in dentists whites revving up the high speed drill and moving in on him
daffys face mask doesnt hide his goofy eager billy flails desperately but it just leaves his mouth unprotected
daffy wedges a claw in moves in with the drill billy
revised may just before the drill can make contact billy and daffy turn to see mr
futterman coming quickly toward them from the doorway
daffy turns on him with the drill aiming for his chest but mr
futterman reaches overhead turns on the bright castle lamp and aims it at daffy who shrieks drops the drill and runs from the dentists office
you okay billy
futterman what are you doing here
i knew youd need help kid
i wasnt gonna let you down
i was tr o find kate
fu un man right
lets m out
he leads billy into the corridoru she is still stuck in the web struggling but suddenly she kate rounding the corner of the corridor flashlight in hand
thank god youre here
i could just leave you there
it seems to be good for your attitude
look about billy
i asked him to go out to dinner with me but it was just business
kate shakes her head impatient
im going to be honest with you
itll be a cathartic openness thing
it wasnt business
i tried to get something going with him
but i couldnt get to first base
does that help
she reaches into her purse and pulls out a swiss army knife
but as she starts cutting marla down marla sees something else and screams the hideous creature that once was mohawk coming toward them
mohawk has the same head and torso he did before but his limbs are now eight fairy spider legs stretching as wide and high as the corrido they hear kates
an in the direction it came from
h mohawk moves toward the women with a spiders predatory nimbleness quickly closing the distance
kate and marla run as fast as they can too fast to notice that the corridor before them is strung with more webs
the sticky filament catches them and as they writhe desperately mohawk smiling clambers toward them for the kill when suddenly a vent in the ceiling clatters open and gizmo drops
from it falling to a display case on the wall between the spider and its prey
he wears a black headband and carries a homemade weapon a bow made from the paper clip and rubber band and a wooden match as an arrow
revised april gizmo sees his enemy menacing kate and marla
grim determination shows on his face as he hears in his mind to survive a war youve got to become war
holding the drawn bow and arrow in front of him he pivots on the display case so that the match scratches against the wall and catches fire and as billy
futterman round the corner they see gizmo loose the arrow which catches spider mohawk in mid body
the flames spread over his body and to his hairy legs as he writhes tumbles over and dies
billy rushes to cut the women free with a pocket knife as mr
futterman looks at gizmo up on the display case
thats gizmo mister fu tprtt hes on our side
futterman gives gizmo a hand down from the display case
to gizmo uh
gizmo responds with a quick stallone style nod as kate and billy embrace
billy indicates gizmo what happened to him
i guess they pushed him too far
thank god youre okay
i am now
could somebody tell me what the i is going on here
revised april well gizmo got wet and then the mogwais ate after midnight and then some of the gremlins must have mutated from the genetic material
and if these things get out of here now well stop em billy
ill tell you something ever since these guys attacked us back in kingston fails ive been scared it would happen again

ngremlins are converging in the lobby george lenny taffy and a host of others
their mood is excited anticipatory
spot tourist paraphernalia on several gremlins cameras and a fodor guidebook
the brain hormone gremlin standing nearest the front doors addresses his charges
is everybody here
a cheer of assent from the gremlins

the brain gremlin holds a sportscoat over one shoulder frank sinatra style
as he nears the doors he starts singing new york new york with the gremlins singing the backup horn part behind himaz c ontinued revised stay

as the gremlins swing into their song an angle on the lobby floor spots two trash cans with swinging lids
grandpa fred peeks cautiously out of one while kstsuji aims his camera out of the other
theyre covering the gremlins from cover like edward r
murrow broadcasting from a bunker
it seems incredible but following their bl urdijnif rampage a destruction these creatures are now mounting what appears to be a production number
billy kate marla gizmo and mr
futterman arrive on the mezzanine
they look over the railing at the gremlin assembly below
hey these guys arent bad billy theyre going to the doors
billy points at the dark glass windows over the lobby
in a few seconds mister clamps going to drop that cloth out there
the sunlight will come in and sunlight
on the unwelcome sound of a thunderclap surrounded by cops reporters and an expectant crowd clamp looks up at the darkening sky where the thunder is growing louder
clamp turns sadly and waves a signal at the guys waiting to drop the red square backdrop dont bother
thunder echoes o
as the brain gremlin cheerfully leads the assembled gremlins closer to the doors

some gremlins have formed a rockettes style kick line while others load cameras and flip through guidebooks such as dining after midnight in new york
billy and the others watch

while on the mezzanine kate grabs a box from a nearby store and mr
futterman hauls out the hose

billy runs to turn on the hose
the brain gremlin reaches for the door
its up to you new york new but before he can open it water splashes onto the lobbys doors its windows its floor
and the gremlins delighted turn to catch the spray
their skin starts to bubble
camera finds miniature gremlins in the bubbles as the lobby fills with the rising smoke and light of gremlin replication
revised may on the mezzanine marla keeps gizmo shielded in the box as mr
futterman uses the gushing hose to knock the climbing gremlins off the sculpture then turns it on the lobby floor again
billy stands beside kate who furiously punches at the video phones keypad tap into the pbx
back through the voice mail module
into the ethernet
five digit code thats it
on the screen of the video phone the electric gremlin writhes in agony trying to gel off hold as the plastic button blinks beneath the screen
billy grabs the phone fr d kew
lifts the receiver and holds it out over the mezzanine rani he looks down at the happily showering gremlins pushes the blinking button dow and sees the electric gremlin shoot
out of the receiver swooping down into the lobby revised may
c tirwued touching his crackling wing to the water thats rising on the floor and a jillion watts of searing electricity spreads across the lobby nailing the gremlins where they
and frying them
on the mezzanine billy and company shield their eyes from the glaring light show and their ears from the gremlins death as the threatened invasion of all new york becomes
a sodden viscous puddle of green churning protoplasm that swamps the lobby
and our heroes sigh with relief their bodies untensing
as the lobby doors b open and clamp comes in leading a swat team in full comba in what he expects to be a last ditch charge and finding nothing
but a s green goo on the lobby floor
he waves the swat team t st p

q k in a dimmed conference room high up in the building forster backs fearfully toward a wall
and the girl gremlin dressed in a bridal outfit moves slowly across the floor toward him with what she imagines is great seductiveness
the girl gremlin saucily undoes a button or two
forster tries to melt into the wall
and we discreetly black out under end credits
