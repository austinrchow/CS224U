written by steve tesich june a narrow dirt road totally surrounded by thick vegetation
here and there we see a huge block of stone blocking the road
the sun is shining but it has a hard time making it through the foliage
in the distance we see four guys walking toward the camera
there is a swagger to their walk
miii is singing
the others are humming along
the melody of the song of bury me not on the lone prairie but its a loose version
by this time the four are in front of the camera
mike is handsome and well built
cyril is tall and skinny
moocher is very short
dave hanging back a little is carrying a large trophy
bellisimot did you really make all that up
the presence of the quarry is felt much stronger now
more and more blocks of cut stone appear
the guys are dwarfed by them
they have to climb over some
i sent away for this stuff from wyoming
itll tell you everything
since you dont believe me maybe youll believe it when you see it
and wed work on the same ranch and sleep in the bunkhouse together eh
thats the whole point
i always miss the whole point
itd be nice to have a paying job again thats for sure
whats that mean
you dont work
you dont eat
thats a terrible thing to say
the quarries are felt even more now
walls of stone rise up around the guys
are you really going to shave your legs
all the italians do it
thats some country
the women dont shave theirs
pauses as if hand on heart it was somewhere along here that i lost all interest in life
ah right over there
saw dolores reineke and fat marvin
theyre married now
you see what i saved you from cyril
had i not told you about the two of them you never would have followed them out here
thank you mike
you made me lose all interest in life and im grateful
my brother says he saw you and nancy
im not seeing her anymore
they are now standing above a huge pool of water with sheer cliffs on three sides
abandoned derricks loom in the distance
dave is now humming softly a neapolitan song
they begin the descent
i kind of miss school
this will be the first time nobodys going to ask us to write a theme about how we spent our summer
remember the tomb of the unknown substitute teacher
she believed us too
sex spelled backwards x es
when youre sixteen they call it sweet sixteen
when youre eighteen you get to drink see dirty movies and vote
but what the hell do you do when youre nineteen
you leave home
my dad says jesus never went further than fifty miles from his home
mike is skipping down the rocks toward the water taking clothes off as he does
the rest follow
and look what happened to him
mike jumps into the water
moocher and cyril follow
dave looks on
the guys are swimming
dave is holding his trophy casually enjoying the beautiful day
he pulls out a little italian phrase book
finds what he wants
oggi fa bello non e vero
sure thing partner
i read where this italian coach said you should never swim after a race
im taking a leak
moocher and mike splash water at him and swim away
all four guys are sunbathing looking at the water
deep x down at the bottom of the quarry hole we see an old icebox
mike is staring at it
the mood is one of total relaxation
arent you glad we got fired from the a and p
right now wed be x working
we didnt get fired
you got fired
one for all and all for one
there arent many places you know thatll hire all four of you know what id like to be
a cartoon of some kind
man x thatd be great
like when they get hit on their head with a frying pan and their head looks like a frying pan with a handle and everything
and then they go b r r r
shakes his head and their head comes back to normal
thatd be great
how come youre so stupid cyril
i dont know
i think i have a dumb heredity
whats your excuse mike
mike hits him hard on the arm
mike stands up
he makes sure theyre all watching and dives in
the guys talk as they follow his progress
you hear from your folks moocher
yeah my dad called
he says theres a lot more jobs inchicago
he hasnt got anything yet
mike has reached the icebox
he opens the door
shuts the door
he wanted to know if the house was sold
they could use the money
you can come and live with me when its sold
in italy everybody lives together
all three of them are getting concerned about mike
ever since you won that italian x bike youve been acting weird
you really think you are italian
wouldnt mind thinking i was s omebody myself
all three of them stand up
maybe the door is stuck
moocher dives in
dave and cyril follow
moocher swims down to the icebox forces the door open
as soon as they hit the surface we hear i o
they see mike standing on top of the rock above them
its got no back on it
he laughs triumphantly
hes ready to dive in again when he pauses and looks
high above where he stands on the other side of the quarry hole we see several figures
the guys are swimming toward the rocks and looking at the figures too
l his face has hardened as he looks at the figures
what the hell are they doing here
x dave moocher and cyril are standing on the rocks below mike
mike is still on top of the rock
high above him are the college kids
three guys and three girls
one of the guys is standing on the ledge above the water
our guys are looking at the college kid on the ledge
he seems intent on diving into the water
its a distance of at least eighty feet
he pushes off and dives in executing a beautiful somersault into a swan dive
they are stunned
hes obviously envious
he looks from the diver toward the guys and seems to feel his position undermined
ive never seen anyone dive off from there
theyve got indoor pools and outdoor pools on the campus but they got to come here
joins the guys its my goddamn quarry
cyril assumes a very dramatic posture
sings to the theme from exodus
this quarry hole is mine
hey screw you cyril
lets get out of here
they are retracing their steps out of the quarry
mike is leading
moocher is behind him
dave is at the end
hes carrying a huge trophy casually
x i o
if they re going to come here then well go ona
a racing bicycle is on top of the car
the guys are in the car and the car is moving fast through the dirt road leading out of the quarries
mike is speeding through the town
a huge billboard with the marlboro man whizzes past us
mike looks angry
hes got an unlit cigarette in his mouth
a car lot is on the right
isnt your dad working today
no the doctor told him to take it easy
hes taking sundays off
city hall is on the left
thats where you go to get a marriage license mooch
yeah so what
cyril laughs and then howls as hes hit
huge modern structures are looming in the distance in stark contrast to the town we just passed through
mikes car is speeding toward them
x mikes car turns into a street called fraternity row
most of the fraternities and sororities are located along this stretch
neat lawns line the area
the houses are enormous an architectural mixture of old manor house and modern motel
the college kids are outside on the lawns
some are reading
girls in bikinis sunbathing
guys washing their cars
some other guys passing the football around
transistor radios playing
mike drives slowly
all the guys are looking out of the windows as if they were in a museum
mike looks at the expensive cars along the way
cyril looks at the girls in bikinis
moocher looks at the huge well built guys
dave just looks
going to college must dosomething to girls tits
just look at them
campussies and sororititties
sticks head out shouts to a couple of girls hi there
whats your major
the girls look up and kind of sneer
they sure look like theyve got it made
thats because theyre rich
italians are all poor but theyre happy
maybe in italy
i wonder what its like to kiss a coed
i wonder about it a lot
ahead of mikes car we see two guys and two girls playing frisbee
they are standing on the lawns and throwing the frisbee to each other across the street
mikes car is moving slowly forward when an ill thrown frisbee lands on the street
mike sees it and speeds up
a girl is running to get it but mike gets there first and runs over it
dave gets a quick look at the girl as she stops suddenly to keep from getting hit
the two college guys run out and give mike the finger
he sees them in the rearview mirror
hey those bastards are giving us the finger
he slams on the brakes
hey cmon mike
were on their turf
dave is looking back at the girl
the two guys are challenging mike motioning to him to come back
the two girls are trying to talk them out of it
mike is gunning the car
they think they own the place
besides youve humiliated them enough
in ancient japan when you ran over a samurais frisbee he had to commit suicide
just as he laughs mike shifts the car in reverse
the two guys and girls are standing in the middle of the road
the guys are coming forward thinking mikes going to stop but mike has no intention of stopping
the girls and the guys split as mikes car roars between them
once again dave catches a fleeting glimpse of the girl
having scattered them mike makes a u turn and drives away in the direction he came from
the girl dave saw katherine is looking after the car holding a cracked frisbee in her hand
the tall well built guy next to her rod her boyfriend looks real upset
he is wearing a little t shirt
goddamn redneck retards
a neapolitan melody plays as dave rides holding his trophy
a romantic song of the south and not southern indiana
the small houses could be italian houses to dave
the people sitting on porches and steps could be italians
dave waves like a returning hero
buon giornol buon giornol hey bambino
the people and the kids look at him like hes an oddball but dave does not notice
a woman is shaking a rug ahead of him and she looks so italian that he cant help but smile
a big blonde girl is coming out of the house dressed in a waitress outfit
she sees dave
is moocher home
but dave just rides past her in a daydream
theyre older people
the man is drinking a beer
he was as normal as pumpkin pie andnow look x at him
the man lets out a long beer belch
his poor parents
l f t
blase house day mr
blase is sitting at a kitchen table
blase is boiling water
blase does not look happy
hes got a flyswatter in his hand
he sees a fly
he hits it
its that cologne he wears
neapolitan sunset its called
well it smells like fruit punch to me and it attracts flies
blase comes over and pours some hot water into his cup
she takes a package of sanka from her apron pocket and puts it in the saucer
blase looks at the table
this is itl you have to watch your diet
diet if anybody found out i was on the diet theyd laugh me out of town
you know what the doctor said
at your age
at my agel what the hell do you mean at my age
he says you have a bad heart
yeah but its got nothing to do with my age

he wanted a year with those bums so i gave him a year
it hasnt been a year yet

hes turned into a ity it was funny at first but its not funny anymore
arrivaderchit thats ity talk
its just hero worship
he says the italians are the best bike racers inthe world and he
this is america evelyn
only paper boys ride bikes and they earn money doing it
re did win his bicycle and he was quite sickly til he started racing around and in three years nes
so now his bodys fine but his mind is gone
he used to be a smart kid
i thought he was going to goy to college
i thought you didnt want him to go to college
why should he go to college
i didnt go to college
when i was nineteen i was working in the quarries ten hours a day
but most of the quarries have shut down
let him find another job
but there arent any jobs
let him look at least
let him come home tired from looking
hes never tired
when i was young i was tired
i had my own place at seventeen
he says italian families stay together i know
its just that i come from a big family myself
and it really was kind of nice
smiles half he thinks we should have another kid
t dave enters carrying his trophy
ah buon giorno papa
im your goddamned father not papa
buon giorno mama
shes your goddamn mother
whatcha do win again
dave opens the fridge and takes out a hunk of cheese and a hunk of salami and starts eating
blase looks at him like a wolf and then he looks at half a grapefruit in front of him
he finds it unbearable to watch him chew
yes the victory
she was easy
but the promoter
fondatore he says the italian team
it will come maybe soon
and i will race with the best
x like the nightingale they sing like the eagles they fly
blase cant bear to watch him eat
speaking of flies
theres a helluva lot of flies following you into the house
fly in italian is mosca
well in english its a pest
and speaking of pests
blase senses an argument
its a nice trophy isnt it dear
yeah so what
ive lived fifty years without ever getting a trophy
you never got trophy papa
no never and whats more
i give you
you are numero uno
dave hands him the trophy
blase is stunned
before he can even think to give it back dave kisses him on both cheeks
dont do thatl how many times
now ihave to go and take a shower
starts to leave such a big house and so few people
i wish i had plenty of fratelly and sorelly to greet me when i come home and to wave when i go
she too would like a big family
blase is holding the trophy and looking at it
neapolitan music is heard coming from daves room
blase has had it
there s that ity music again
x im going to have it out with him now
he goes to daves room carrying the trophy with him
blase follows him a few steps and stops
she is apprehensive
she wants to follow and help dave out but she stays behind wringing her hands
blase reappears looking quite stunned
hes holding the trophy in one hand along his side
whats the matter
well so what
his legs evelyn
hes shaving x his legs
i saw him
huamoing along with the record player dave is shaving away at his overly lathered legs
a record is turning
on top of the dust cover we see an album cover enrico gimdndi sings neapolitan favorites
x the camera moves slowly around his room
there are bicycle trophies everywhere
posters of italian racers
posters of italian movies
magazine covers and newspaper clippings from italian racing magazines
bicycle parts spare wheels
several bicycle jerseys hanging on the doorknob
enrico ginsondi sings during
this tour of daves room
dave comes out of the shower humming along
a cat comes to greet him meowing
ah there you are fellini
he goes to a drawer and takes out a can of chef boy ar dee spaghetti and meatballs
still humming he opens the can and dumps the food into a deep ashtray with cinzano written on the sides
be looks at the posters of the bicycle riders
he looks in the mirror
he takes a comb and combs his hair back in the continental style
then he smiles
he picks up a book italian pease book and lies down on the bed to read it
a big sign campus cars
the car lot is nowhere near the campus but the sign is considered good business
all around the car lot are other signs best deal in town
cars with a college education
the cars themselves have signs on them grad school special
english major phd homecoming queen cum the customer is a young college kid
blase is showing him the homecoming queen
it gets thirty miles to a gallon x of course the mileage you get may vary
its a beaut right
you sure know how to pick them
frankly this is the best car on the lot
ciao papal mr
hes on his bike across the street
blase is looking at his customer pretending he has no idea who dave is
he shrugs and turns his back and quickly glances over his shoulder as dave rides away
students are everywhere and so are classroom buildings
tall new limestone structures resembling office buildings
students sit on the steps outside the buildings
they are lying around on the grass and walking to and from classes
all of them have books in hand
the wind is blowing
hes sitting next to his bike on the grass and looking around at all of them
in his hands he has his italian phrase book the book being his admission ticket into this world
its obvious hes feeling a little out of place but he enjoys looking at the campus world
a campus police car drives by and dave quickly hides his face in the book
waits for it to pass and when he looks up he is struck by something
shes coming out of a classroom building with a bunch of books and papers in her hands
the wind is blowing her hair back
the camera zooms in on her face isolating her from all the others just as dave is doing
his mouth is open
he blinks once
mama mia i as shes walking she transfers her books from one hand to the other
a piece of paper escapes her and flies away in the wind
he sees the paper fly away and jumps up
she tries to go after the paper but the traffic keeps her from crossing the street
the papers flying away
she gives up and turns toward the parking lot just as we see dave on his cont
bicycle chasing after the paper
he cuts through the cars he cuts in front of them
the horns blow
the brakes screech
all dave sees is the paper
hes on a mission
he cuts through the pedestrians crossing the street maneuvering brilliantly
hes just walking
he sees the piece of paper flying around and grabs it casually
just as hes ready to read it a hand appears in the frame and snatches it away from him
its dave riding away with the piece of paper in his hand
the college guy just stands and looks after him
shes driving home
in her rearview mirror she spots something
a bicycle rider
he seems to be gaining on her
she speeds up almost instinctively
got the paper in his mouth and he speeds up too
he shifts his gear
shes riding along
she glances in the rearview mirror and sees dave quite close behind her with the paper in his mouth
she shifts her gears too
she smiles a little
hes close enough to shout
he opens his mouth to shout
the paper flies out but he quickly catches it in mid air
he has momentarily lost ground on her but he sticks the paper in his mouth and pours it on
shes crossing the street just as the light changes
dave crosses on the red light
once again hes nearly hit by several cars
he follows katherine up the hill leading to fraternity row
he overtakes her just as
shes about to turn into the drive leading to her sorority
but dave is there on her right preventing her from turning
she too almost hits him
she slams on her brakes
dave slams on his
they come to a dead stop
hes handing her the paper but then he pauses and pulls it back just as shes about to take it
he wipes the saliva off the paper on his jersey and then gives it to her
it is yours
she takes the paper and smiles
then she laughs
you mean youve been chasing me with this
well thats redly something
thank you very much
talk about chivalry
dave is just looking at her
shes never seen anyone look at her quite like that
shes a bit confused
well thanks again
an exchange student or something
i am italian
my name is enrico gimondi
x and mine is katherine maxwell
ah katherinal cont
l she likes the sound of this
but the way dave looks at her is unsettling
well thanks again again
she looks after him
theres a big campus realty sign outside the house with a for sale tacked over it
nancy is walking up to the screen door
moocher appears holding a huge barbell at shoulder height
they smile nervously at each other
i was just on my way to work
he pushes the door open with one end of the barbell and lets her in checking the street to make sure nobody saw her
she goes in
moocher shuts the other door too
the two room house is empty except for a sleeping bag and a wooden foot locker moocher resumes working with the barbells

she smiles happy at the prospect of a nice walk together
dave and cyril are going through the outskirts of the campus
dave is riding his bike slowly
cyril is jogging along
they go past the campus arts cinema
dave looks at the marquee fellinis amarcord
he looks away and then looks back at it
some kids are playing basketball outside a garage
as cyril and dave are ready to go past them cyril jumps into the game
he steals the ball
he dribbles fades away and shoots a long jump shot
it goes in
he rejoins dave but he looks back at the game
its clear he misses basketball
i bloomington day dave is riding his bike

she seems nervous and is constantly looking from the road to the rearview mirror
just keep it steady
rod and five of his fraternity brothers are riding their bicycles behind the car
keep your elbows bent

thirty an hourl dave is riding his bicycle
a sudden explosive noise of a tire going flat
he puts the brakes on
dave is taking the front wheel off
hes peeling the tire off the rim ready to put on a spare
katherine is driving toward him
he sees her
she sees him
as she goes past him she slows down a little but enough to
make rod almost run into her
what the hell you doing she speeds up and she and the bike riders go past dave
on the back of the riders jerseys we see little
he looks after them pumping up his spare
blase is sitting at a table
blase is at the stove putting food on a plate
those college kids arent so smart
i sold one of my worst cars to one of them today
theyre not so smart
its a good thing that dave didnt
blase puts the plate of food in front of him
he looks at it
its sauteed zucchini

it reminds him of dave
it reminds him of the kid atthe lot and his contradictory emotions about daves future
thats ity food

dave is sneaking home
dave has his bicycle with him
blase in bed
x dave is putting free oil on his bike
barking is heard o
a mailman appears
he hands dave the mail and continues x on his way the dogs barking and snapping at his heels
dave picks his sports illustrated magazine out of the packet and walks slowly to the house leafing through it
he stops suddenly
he drops the other mail as he
zeroes in on some article in the magazine
he runs in the house just as mrs
blase runs out of the house
they run into each other
dave picks her up and spins her
whats the matter
the italians are coming to a race in indianapolis
the team lets her go grazia tante santa maria
oh dave try not to become catholic on us
your fathers quite protestant
dave is on his bike beaming with happiness zooming down the street
he hears the dogs barking
he sees the mailman
he speeds toward him
jumps the curb with his bike and comes to a dead stop in front of the mailman
jumps off the bike and hugs the mailman kissing him on both cheeks
grazia signor molte
the stunned mailman has no time to reply
dave jumps back on his bike and rides away
dave is riding his bike
hes filled with joy and wants to share it with somebody
he spots a flower shop
he smiles and heads for
the clerk behind the counter is suzy
she was one of the girls playing frisbee on page
you want the flowers sent to katherine maxwell

the guys are inside
cyril is holding onto moochers arm
moocher is trying to free himself
campus car wash

he frees himself from cyril and goes

campus street car wash day x a bunch of college kids are washing cars
the owner a very hefty tall man is talking to moocher
youre a little late but i guess you wont let it happen again
heres your sponge and heres your rag and theres your place
moocher takes the sponge and the rag and heads for the car wash
he goes past the punch clock
dont forget to punch the clock shorty
we see moocher from the back
he stops suddenly when he hears the word shorty
he turns around slowly
he looks at the owner
he wraps the rag around his fist
and then with a sudden explosive movement he punches the clock with his fist knocking it off the wall
he tosses the sponge aside and walks out shaking the pain from his fist
moocher walks out
mike and the guys are gone
he puts his bands in his pockets and starts home
mikes car suddenly appears
everyone is cheering
mikes blowing his horn
moocher gets in the car
jukebox is playing
some kids are dancing
the place is packed
here and there we see t shirts with little on them
the camera pans slowly as we hear voices above the din
s have their whole team back
theyre all swimmers

we had mark spitz in our fraternity but he wouldnt ride
whos the girl with him
suzy says this guys sent you x flowers

she slaps him
rod looks around to see if anyone saw that he got hit
a shot of katherines girl friend suzy
she smiles at rod
he looks away from her
she gets up
leaves a quarter for the coffee and leaves
rod looks around once again and once again he sees suzy smiling at him
he looks away
a new loud song begins on the jukebox
dave is riding in his church clothes
his trousers as before are rolled up to avoid getting dirty from the chain
hes feeling great
its a nice day
hes been to church
he hears the music of italy in his soul
as hes crossing an intersection he sees moocher and nancy going down the street
as if wondering whether to join them
decides not to
he rides away in his direction
the camera stays on moocher and the girl
they are stopping in front of her house
blase is making some french fries
blase is looking very neurotic
hes listening to the music filtering in from daves room
i want an answer evelyn
whatre we going to do with him
i dont know dear
i suppose we could strangle him while hes asleep
thats not funny evelyn
why dont you talk to him
im afraid to talk to him
im afraid to look at him
im afraid if i did id see his eyes twirling like pinwheels
blase brings the fries
the only reason im giving you these french fries is because you promised to calm down
dont expect to get them again
blase is still annoyed by daves music
i cant eat while that noise is on
he gets up and heads toward daves room
dave appears dressed for riding
they cross paths
blase goes to wash the pan in the sink
dave sees the french fries on x the table
he sits down and starts eating them
the music stops
blase turns around and sees dave eating the french fries
she wants to say something
blase reappears and sees dave eating his fries
but the french fries are gone
dave looks at his father x and mother
he suddenly clutches his heart
blase is frightened
oh my god
whats the matter
my heart mama
mio cuorol its his heart
its those damn french fries he ate
i am in love mama papa
gets up and hugs his father then walks toward i have such a pain in my heart
he walks out
blase goes to the empty plate
blase opens the fridge and starts putting all kinds of food into a bag cheeses sausage the rest of the eggs in the carton
blase looks at her
what are you doing
i wont have any heart attack food in my house
that was gods warning to us
if anybody dies around here it wont be on my conscience
what are you doing evelyn
these are all the food the doctor said you cant have
and theyre all going out
l she is in fact piling them into the trash can
blase looks on trying to keep his composure
im having a nightmare
dave is combing back his hair in the italian style while riding
in his other hand he has his italian phrase book
hes notriding very hard
to the right of him in the fields we see a few cows and horses
above him on the electrical wires birds are perched like musical notes
hes riding and humming
the camera swings up picking up the birds on the wires and dave seems to be humming a motif created bytheir pattern
the utility poles whiz by faster and faster
dave is facing the opposite way from the way he came
he puts the phrase book away
his face changes
a hard competitors look is in his eyes
he looks at his wristwatch
dave is at a junction of a country road and a highway
hes about to ride onto the highway
he looks at his watch as he does
we see a truck behind him making the same turn
as dave gets on the highway we see a sign bloomington miles
the truck follows him
dave is building up speed when the truck passes him
we see a big sign on the back cinzano
dave speeds up and gets behind the truck to use it as a windbreak
he sees dave behind him and speeds up shifting gears
he shifts gears
he looks at his speedometer
hes going forty
he looks in the side mirror
he sees dave
he sticks out four fingers
he looks at the speedometer
hes going fifty
he sticks out five fingers
he cant believe dave is still there
he shifts again
hes going all out now
his highest gear
a cut to he looks at the speedometer
hes going sixty he looks at the side mirror and still sees dave
suddenly he also sees a red flashing light and hears the siren of a state trooper
hes still going hard only now theres no truck in front of him
he looks back over his shoulder and sees the truck and the state trooper at the side of the road
sweat is dripping down his chin
pain is beginning to distort his face
but his legs move in the same rhythmical motion
we see dave and his bicycle disappear down one
of the rolling hills and then reappear again on the incline
dave is now a dot on the horizon
he shifts gears and starts to sprint
his face is agony now
as dave goes past the sign he quickly looks at his watch
a huge grin breaks in his salt covered face and he reaches for his water bottle and sprays his head with it as if it were victory champagne
ahead of him we see the marlboro man billboard
we zero in on a phrase come to where the flavor is
mike acyril and moocher are sitting on the sidewalk
mike is looking at a magazine with the marlboro man on the back cover thats the place to be
look at that
praires and mountains and nobody around
all you need is a bedroll and a good horse
dont forget your toothbrush
youre still in your cavity prone years
a campus police car pulls up
here comes your brother
mike puts a cigarette in his mouth as his brother a campus cop in his late twenties comes out
i hear youve been hot rodding through the campus again
i was just
ill take the car back if you keep it up
all right all right
the cop is heading toward the cafe
howre you doing guys
were a little disturbed by the developments in the middle east but other than that
the cop goes into the cafe as soon as he does mike acts tough again
camp pussie cop
hey i know what
letts all drive to terre haute tomorrow
theres supposed to be a whorehouse there
im busy tomorrow
both of them feel a little guilty
mike pretends he doesnt care
i never pay for it anyway
but its dark enough to be evening
the sky is black and its raining
blase stands in the doorway of his office
hes looking out
for once hes a little relaxed
nobody will come in this weather
maybe hes thinking about his youth
his eyes fall on his potbelly
he sucks it in
but he cant hold it in
lets it out and goes back to thinking
its still raining
moocher is helping the waitress nancy carry in a huge chest of drawers
moocher is carrying it solo
youre so strong
one of the drawers falls out of the chest
nancys x clothes scatter on the sidewalk
nancy puts the clothes back in the drawer and then she too pauses as she picks up a long nightgown
holds it against herbody as she folds it slowly looking at moocher and he at her still holding the chest of drawers
you know what
moocher i x no what
im thinking of getting my hair done
she puts the nightgown in the drawer
then she demonstrates
pushing her hair back
i thought maybe something like this
what do you think
hes looking at nancy
the new hairdo shes suggesting makes her look lovely
blase is driving one of the fanciest cars off his lot
mr blase is dressed neatly
hes wearing a jacket and
tie although its hot and hes sweating
blase pulls into the parking lot and gets out
he looks at the shop
the noise of machinery is heard from the huge building
the noise gets louder as mr
blase walks toward it trying to avoid stepping into the limestone dust with his polished shoes but the dust is everywhere
several cutters are having lunch
they are eating heartily right outside the shop
the noise is even louder but they dont seem to be bothered by it
one of them looks
well look whos back
he has to shout to be heard
the others look
hes glad to be back but hes also trying to keep a little distance as if proud of how far he had come in life
he smiles and waves grandly his suit and tie sticking out in this surrounding
damn it you dont look like one of them government safety inspectors
no a union organizer
they all laugh and get up to greet him
all except one younger man who continues sitting and eating
the cutters slap mr
blase on the back their dusty hands leaving dusty imprints on his jacket
well start you as an apprentice again
like hell you will
im j us t visiting
but if i wanted to come back i could pick up where i left off
the entrance to the shop draws him forward
a couple of the cutters accompany him
he takes half of a sandwich from one of them
its lunch hour at the shop and the old instincts are coming back
blase looks back over his shoulder hurt by this remark
the noise is now deafening
dust is everywhere and slowly through the dust we see men working pausing only long enough to smile and wave at mr
blase is finishing off his sandwich just like the cutter next to him who walks to his place leaving mr
blase who has no place here to wonder
huge blocks of stone are being cut by saws
moving back and forth and back and forth in an almost hypnotic motion
water falling down to cool the blades
blases coat is draped over it
blase hes driving in wooden wedges into the cut block of limestone
water is falling on him
a toothless old timer is
grinning at him
its hard to tell which is sweat and which is water on mr
cranes are moving overhead
huge blades are spinning huge columns of limestone chisels indenting grooves
hes borrowing a cigarette from a cutter lighting it
hes tired and out of breath
the man moves on to do his work
mr blase smokes his cigarette looking on
in love with this place and yet out of place
a man is shouting at him
he cant hear
he finally hears him
a shot of the cutter who didnt know mr
blase sits down in the chair where his coat is draped
he has sat in this chair before in the younger days
he feels the notches in the armrest
he picks up a piece of limestone
lying along the side of the chair and then he looks the place over one more time
hes on a bike
we dont know where he is
its raining hard around him
the camera pulls back and we see that hes riding the rollers a stationary device on which his bike is placed
hes outside his house on the porch
he sees cyril running through the rain towards him
cyril is wearing a yellow
rubber rain cape and carrying a guitar
fade tffi ough to mrs
blase is mopping the kitchen floor
enrico gimondi is singing in daves room
cyrils guitar is heard
blase pauses in her mopping
there is a look of romantic yearning in her eyes
the phonograph is off
cyril his tongue between his teeth is playing a simple melody of one of enrico giniondis songs
hes gloomy at the start but gets happier as he continues
hes smiling too
hes wearing a hairnet
thats itt thats the song cyril i recognize it
only youll have to make it louder
dont you worry
ill make this catgut meow
it gets up and leaves
blase has pulled in and is getting out of his car
its still raining although not as hard
he runs to the house
opens the door and the cat runs out startling him a bit
he has stopped in his tracks and looks on stunned
she has prettied herself up
a different hairdo
a nice dress
some nice makeup
you waxed the floor eh
looks nice dave and cyril are riding double on the bike
cyril carries his guitar
candles are lit on the kitchen table
blase are sitting facing each other
blase picks up a carrot stick and chomps on it
chomps on hers
blase is so unsettled by the way his wife looks that he almost seems to be enjoying the carrot stick
how about a little mus
cyril is standing next to the building
he starts playing on his guitar
dave is further out standing in the parking lot looking up at the windows a few lights go on upstairs
blase is putting on the enrico gimonde album
a shot x of the album cover
enrico looks out at us smiling
cyril is playing the same song that enrico is singing in x davets room
we see several girls
n the window upstairs
one of them is katherine
other girls are coming crowding behind her
down below dave is singing
revised bambino cont
hes using every gesture of a neapolitan serenader
only they dont seem artificial
hes in the spirit of the moment
she feels obliged because of her girl friends to look upon daves performance as something corny and silly but slowly her face is changing as she is charmed by the
her girl friends hush behind her and they too look on as if sorry they werent the ones being serenaded
in the back suzy looks on too play it cyril
blase is standing in the doorway of the kitchen
shes looking at mra
enrico gimonde is singing
blase is holding a carrot in his hand
he seems ready to bite it but some other instinct moves within him and despite himself he gets up
inta chi delt sorority x suzy is on a phone
we hear dave singing o
oh his rod
i was just wondering if you knew that there was a guy here with a guitar serenading bath
closeup dave o a hes singing
shes completely won over
behind her we once again see suzy
blase is in bed
she takes the flower out of her hair and places it on the other side of her
blase is pulling off his t shirt
enrico is singing
x daves cat is meowing
rod and several of his frat brothers are rushing out toward rods mercedes convertible
chi deli sorority closeup of tee window x the girls are applauding
katherine is not there
katherine is riding away on daves bike
cyril looks on
the last light goes out as enrico gimonde begins another x ext
chi deli sorority night x cyril is walking away out of the parking lot still strumming his guitar
a car is coming up the street
that must be him
he slams on the brakes
cyril stops strummming
he sees a bunch of guys rushing out of the car toward him
if i were a cartoon id go help
and youd see my tonsils wiggling in the back
he starts to run
rod and his friends run after him
dave and katherine have returned
shes just getting off the bike i have to go in
buono notte katherina
i havent ridden double since i was a small girl and ive never been serenaded
so it was a lovely evening
shes a little embarrassed by her italian and dave the pro gestures that it wasnt so bad
she leans over
bloomington closeup c
il day his face is all bruised
hes drinking a bottle of coke and walking
mike cyril and dave are with him
they are crossing the railroad tracks
he wont tell me who

all i can tell you for sure is that they all wore brut aftershave and smelled of lavoris
x what were you doing there by yourself
cyril and dave exchange looks
h t at kind of car did they drive
it was this mercedes convertible
revised bambino c cont
ive seen that car
they want to fight
wetll give them a fight
chief mike plenty brave
but i say this we rednecks are few
paleface college students are many
i counsel peace
mike grabs him
lets find the bastard
cyril sees a trash can
he hooks shoots with the coke bottle
it goes right in and breaks
x mikes car is moving through the campus
theyre all looking at the cars going by
mikes car is parked next to a grassy field
theyre all watching cars going by
cyril shakes his head
on the field a bunch of college kids are gathering for a game of football
the college kids are laughing and playing
hes not looking at cars anymore
he s looking at the game
the game is over
its getting dark
the college kids are splitting up into little groups and going home
i really thought i was a great quarterback in high school
i still think so
i cant even bring myself to light a cigarette cause i keep thinking i should stay in shape
and you know what gets me
living here and reading in the papers how some hotshot kid is the new star on the college team
every year therell be a new one and its never going to be me
ill just be mike
twenty year old mike
thirty year old mike
old mean old man mike
but the college kids will never get old
out of shape
cause new ones come every year
and theyll keep calling us cutters
to them its a dirty word but to me itll just be something else i never got a chance to be
he falls silent and sticks a cigarette in his mouth
his genuine confession has caught everybody
including himself off guard
the guys look at him with sympathy and under standing but mike doesnt like that
he starts the car up
i have to go somewhere
dave and katherine are walking together
ive never been to naples but it sounds lovely
we live by the sea
my papa he has a boat
my mama she has ten bambini
and i am eleven
and when i left for america they all cry big tears
tears big like figs
ka herine takes out a little book from her bag
look what i bought
i figured i might as well learn a little
shes holding the exact italian phrase book that dave has
dave gestures that the book is no good
you never learn italian from book
i know that book
they head toward the union
rod is with a different girl
they are driving through the campus
you havent pledged any sorority yet
most frat guys wont go out with dormies
im the exception
youre on the swimming team eh
he gives her his cool full of hints smile
rods car is going one way
approaching him from the other direction we see mikes car
mike spots the mercedes
as its about to go past him mike shifts his car in reverse and winds up going backwards parallel to rods car
rod is looking at him
mike is looking at him
is that him
revisen bambino cont
mike shifts the car into first and waits for an opening to make a u turn
who were they
a bunch of cutters
what are cutters
he finds a gap in the traffic and makes a u turn
rod pulling in
reaches over casually but deliberately and opens the door for the girl
the student union is a large l shaped affair
music is playing
a few people are dancing
the rest are seated at tables
the place is packed at least in the long part of the l
in the short part of the l away from all this
and out of view of the hordes are a few other people
there we see dave and katherine
a waiter is coming up to them
due capuccino por favors
x the waiter grunts
mikes car is parked next to the mercedes
the guys are looking at the car and then looking at the forbidding entrance to the student union
we cant go in there
all three of them start up the long stairway leading to the fortress like union
rod and his girl are looking for a place to sit
seeing no empty spots in the area they head toward the area where dave and katherine are sitting
just as theyre about to turn the corner and probably see them somebody gets up and rod takes the table
they are drinking their coffee
its kind of nice to hear of somebody who misses his parents
certo i miss
just like you miss your mama and papa
i hardly miss them
i went as far as i could to get away from them
ah but they miss you eh
at home they sit and look at your
picture ah they are saying how we miss our katherina our bambina
katherine is near tears
the homelife daves describing is obviously not hers
not wanting to cry she takes out a cigarette and a lighter and dave being a continental gentleman takes the lighter from her
he doesnt know what to make of it
he fiddles with it and then strikes and a huge jet of flame shoots out
dave is frightened
he lets go of the button but the lighter is stuck and the flame is still burning
he blowson it
he shakes it
katherine starts laughing
finally in desperation dave pours coffee on the lighter and it goes out
you shouldnt smoke
i go bring more coffee
he takes the cups toward the self service cafeteria line
they are standing in the uhion wondering where to go
they look lost and intimidated but trying to look tough
dave appears in their field of vision at the end of the cafeteria line but they are looking elsewhere
just as they seem to turn and see him mike spots a tall blond guy very much like rod going into the bowling alley
there he is
our trio heads for the bowling alley
dave is standing directly behind rod
in front of rod are several hero worshipping guys listening to rod
the only way to train for bike racing is what we do in swi g interval training
they use interval training and the italians
they beat the pants off germans
dave thinks this is funny and laughs
rod turns around and gives him a scornful look
dave recognizes him
rod doesnt recognize dave
mike cyril and moocher are standing behind the blond guy they followed
cyril is goofing around with a bowling ball
he sticks his finger in the hole
the blond guy turns around
he sees the three guys staring at him
hi there want to roll some balls
mike moocher and cyril are leaving the bowling alley
cyril is trying to hide the ball hes carrying
his finger is stuck in the hole
i cant get it out
college rids are looking at them
its obvious who they are
mike is leading
the way but even hes feeling out of place
my finger cant breathe as some busty coeds go past him hi whats your major
they enter the long part of the l shaped room
looks like he left
the trio starts heading toward the revolving door
they pass rods girl
shes sitting alone
and whats your major
rod shows up carring a tray of drinks
cyril looks up
mike sees him
its clear he wishes he didnt
moocher resigns himself to the inevitable
starts wrapping a handkerchief around his fist
cyril is cringing
thats a nice major
whatre you cutters doing here
did you get lost
then why dont you get lost now
i feel like that cartoon again
a bunch of rods cronies sitting nearby laughs
they crowd in around the cutters
cyril and moocher look at mike for guidance
mike is on the spot
its not that hes afraid of a fight its just that hes on a foreign turf
is that him cyril
cyril gets the cue
i dont think so
lets get out of here
smart move shorty
this is all moocher needs
he hits rod right in the tray spilling the drinks all over him
rod falls back knocking the table down
his friends jump up to his aid
our guys are surrounded
the only opening is the cafeteria line
mike is hit and falls back knocking down a tail row of plates saucers cups
cyril is swinging the bowling ball around himself for protection
more rows of plates fall as the ball hits them
the college guys led by rod are trying to advance but our guys are throwing plates and maybe even food at them
the college guys are throwing back what they can
cyrils ball flies off and hits somebody in the stomach
by now its a free for all
they are all alone now
everybody on their side has left to see the fight
they get up too to have a look
he sees his friends surrounded and battling back
he wants to help but katherine is right there
she sees rod
the fight is going at full blast
whats going on
just some cutters making trouble
dave is stung by this remark
he plows into the fight
katherine grabs rim and tries to pull him away
she can not tell which side he is on
through the revolving doors the campus police arriveled by mikes brother
we go now
katherine takes dave by the arm
they are breaking up the fight
mikes brother looks angrily at mike and the guys as he pulls rod away
the cutters started itt his anger changes direction as he looks back at rod
hes well dressed
jacket and tie
the camera pulls back
a dozen other student leaders are there
one of them is black
the president is at his desk
on his far right we see mikes brother sitting alone
most of you will only spend four years here but to a lot of us bloomington is our home and
dont like the way you are behaving in my home
these needless hostilities have happened before
they will not happen again
if you feel compelled to compete with the kids from the town then you will do it in a different arena
i am looking at a plan to open our intramural program to them
and as a starting point in consultation with mr
armstrong we have decided to expand the field of this years little to include a team from the town
a loud protest is heard from everybody
but sir theyre not good enough
having them in the race
the whole thing reeks of tokenism
everybody even rod looks at him
its sort of like what are you talking about
dave is on the bike
cyril is walking
the funniest part is that tough guy mike didnt get a punch in
you shouldve been there
i have to go
are you going to see katherine
i have to go train
the italians will be here soon
he rides away
moocher and nancy are standing outside
moocher is fishing through his pockets for money
ill pay for it
what do you mean
ive got money
we can go dutch
on a marriage licenses you know what
but i like it
dave rides past them
he looks at them just as they goinside
dave is riding
the light is turning yellow
he speeds up to make the light
a car going at a right angle to him has to cometo a screeching halt to avoid hitting him
blase with a customer and his family
the car stalls
dave looks back over his shoulder
sees his father and waves
hes beginning to cringe but tries to be confident
he tries to start the car up
hes blocking traffic and horns are blowing
the car wont start
you know what
i put premium gas in this baby by mistake
it hates expensive
he tries to laugh about this but nobody in the car is buying the story
the camera moves back and we see mr
blase and the family sitting in the car getting towed
blase is draped over the wheel his head down
the kids are crying
will you please stop crying
the car didnt really die
its just an expression
blase is shaking with hostility
hes trying to drink a glass of milk but its spilling
i should have hit him when i had my chance
hed be dead now
no more worries
ill talk to him dear
ill tell him hell either have to get a job or go to college
collegel so he can thumb his diploma at me
hes lying on the bed exhausted but listening
daves never thumbed anything at anybody
thats because he hasnt been to collegei besides hes probably too stupid to get in
dont say that
hell hear you
i dont care
its my house
he x doesnt understand english anyway
im sure hell find a job somewhere
x he couldnt get a job to savehis x life
hes worthless evelyn
i could die of shame everytime i see him goddamn lazy freeloader
similar shot as the opening of the film
voices and laughter o
rod katherine rods teammates and their girls are walking through the quarries
i discovered this place
its really something
wait til you see it
mike cyril moocher and dave are sitting on the rocks above the water
the mood is quite different from the last time they were here
there is physical and emotional distance between them
and why not
don t want to be in the little
christ i thought youtd jump at the chance
well i just
helooks at cyril
cyril knows why he doesnt want to be in it
dont want to be seen with all those college kids
thats the whole point
they all be there we can beat those shitheads in front of everybody
it takes four guys to have a team
we got four
we all enter just to get in and dave rides the whole thing and we win
its just that
ill be working that day
dave has said it and now feels he has to stick with it
yes im getting a job
yeah i need the money
oh thats just great
youre a real pal dave
look the time comes when we all
l interrupts i wasnt talking to you
i dont give a damn
youre not a quarterback here you know
at least i was once which is one helluva lot
better than being a midget all my life
moocher is stung by the remark
but he controls his normal reaction with difficulty
cyril is very upset by all this
hes starting to cry
hey bambini the cosa eh
just drop that italian shit eh
im so sick of that shit
a pall falls over the group
moocher and cyril feel badfor dave
daves smile vanishes
he feels a little foolish himelf
mike is almost sorry he said what he did but having said it he feels compelled to continue
driving you to bike races
what the hell am i your private chauffeur or something
i dont ever remember you paying
for the gas
sure its fun to win
get all the glory for yourself but when it comes time to do something for the rest of us
i think youre just afraid of those college guys
and youre not
the only thing im afraid of is wasting the rest of my life with you guys
i thought that was the plan
wed waste the rest of our lives together
l mike stands up
hes ready to walk away
he pauses suddenly
on the other side of the quarry he sees rod and his group
dave sees katherine and without making it obvious to the others leans back behind a rock
mike is looking at rod
rod sees him and just stands there
his friends katherine included seem to be trying to get him to leave
but he doesnt
mike feels the eyes of his gang on him
he gestures to rod to come in the water
mike runs up his rock and dives in
rod dives off his side
the two of them are swimming toward each other
theyre going to race
what the hells he doing
they are side by side
rod is smiling
mike takes off toward one end of the quarry swimming as fast as he can
rod lets him go
looks up at his friends and takes off after hiu
mike is splashing clumsily but going as hard as he can
rod is smooth and powerful
he catches up to mike
he changes from breaststroke to backstroke
its all so easy for him
hes staying out of sight of katherine
hes feeling quite badly for having to hide
rod has reached the all of the quarry and is waiting
mike reaches the wal
a rhausted and starts back again
rod seems amused
he thc ght the race was over
he takes off after mike imitating the way mike is swimming
his friends laugh
cz oseup the cb i x s all three of our guys are feeling badly for mike
once again rod is waiting by the wall
mike shows up
he cant see the edge
t with his head and starts bleeding
but he pushes off and starts going back again
even rod is getting to feel a little bad
how long is he going to keep going
not much longer
there wont be an water left the way hes splashing
mike seems to be half drowning
he cant see where hes going
hes no longer swimming in a straight line
his head is bleeding and hes running into the edges of the quarry
hitting them with his hands
his hands are bleeding too
but he continues splashing pathetically and yet defiantly through the water
hes no longer swimming
hes quite perplexed that mike keeps going
isnt it clear he lost
they are leaving the quarry
he watches katherine disappear
hes angry with himself
he jumps out of his hiding place into the water
hes swimming in a total daze
blood is dripping down his face
dave is swimming toward him
moocher and cyril are behind dave
mikes arms go around daves neck
hes smiling a little through his pain
as he relaxes he lets his weight sink on dave and dave sinks under water
blase is sitting at the bar
and make it a double
havent you had enough mr
ive had enoughof your lips thats for sure
i said i want a double and i want a double on the double
nancy looks at the owner of the place
he nods to her to do as he says
nancy then goes and picks up the phone
this is nancy down at nicks
i think you better come down
she is rushing in through the door of the bar and grill
blase is still at the counter
nancy greets her as she comes in
now much did he have
well he started off with a single order of french fries
then he had some onion rings
and then he ordered a double order of each
right now hes on a cheeseburger deluxe
shes heard enough
she rushes to mr

blase has a mouthful
he speaks through it
leave me alone
oh youve got catsup all over your shirt
lets go home
blase are walk
im just tired of it evelyn

i dont want him selling used cars
if its good enough for you
who says its good enough for me
damn right its good enough for me
i dont need help
hed ruin me if i hired him
a weirdo like that
its clear that mr
blase has higher hopes for dave which he has difficulty admitting even to himself
dave is sitting in his room and looking around
the room looks empty and lonely
dave is looking at his sports illustrated magazine
we see four smiling riders with their arms around each other
theres a caption underneath the picture team cinzano to race a car is heard pulling up into the drive
dave looks up
blase are walking in
dave is waiting for them
i want to talk to youl yes papa
i want to talk to you too
you know what youre going to dol im going to get a job
a this was the very thing that mr
blase wanted to say
he feels robbed of not gettinga chance to say it
i see nothing
wherere you going to get a job
wash place is still hiring
car washl you shouldve died when you had the german measles
no son of mine is going to wash cars
dave is washing one of mr
blases cars on the lot
hes whistling a neapolitan song as he does
blase looks on
hes unhappy to see dave there
and hes unhappy because dave seems happy
hey no whistling
youre a shag boy so shag
if i wanted whistling id get a bird
hes washing cars
he stops whistling and washes eagerly
the suns reflected in the cars windows
washing another car
in the windows we see a reflection of mr
blases neon signs
blase shuts the sign off
howre you feeling
revised bambino t a cont
you might as well get used to it
from now on its more of the same
lets go home
i have to train
dave is riding his bike
a car comes toward him with its headlights on and as they go past him hes scrubbing a hubcap
we see his face reflected in it
once again as the approaching car lights go past him we hes waxing a car
he sees mike cyril and moocher driving past in theirs waving at him
he waves back
we follow the car as it disappears and then hes hc ing down a car
a group of fraternity guys go past the lot on their bikes
rods at the head
theyre all wearing little t shirts
dave looks after them
blase is standing in the doorway of his office looking out
dave is riding the rollers and eating his lunch
theres nowhere to hide from the rain so hes getting wet
he looks tired
hes thinking of the italians
as he turns his legs we see the picture of the italians around each other smiling
then we see another picture dave is in the middle of the italians
he has his arms around them
hes smiling just like they are
hes smiling at the image he sees
his eyes are closing
he loses his balance and falls off the rollers on the ground
the above sequences should be accompanied by music from daves italian recordings
the music stops when he falls off
dave and katherine are having coffee
dave looks exhausted
hes ready to fall asleep
are you all right
just study too hard
i have big exam tomorrow
are you going back to italy in the sunmter
my papa needs help
well i called up my parents
im getting a graduation present

dave suddenly seems to wake up
maybe i have to go to summer school
can i have this saturday off
just this once
you see the italians are coming saturday
i dont care if the second comings coming
but ive waited so long
n double o no
we see one of mr
blase s cars
the homecoming queen
a bunch of college kids are pushing it into the lot
you stay out of this
blase is standing in front of the homecoming queen
hes got his hands on the hood and is pushing
the kid who bought it is at the other end with his friends
they are pushing the other way
you gave me your word
can i see it on paper
there was no paper
you gave me your word
i dont remember giving my word
pushes on the car now get this car out of here
dave appears next to him
you did papa
you gave him your word
i heard you
we are poor but were honest
blase is stunned
he starts to push real hard
all i want is a refund
are you crazy
refundl hes getting very red in the face
hess pushing for all hes worth
the kids are pushing the other way
blase becomes a fanatic
his veins are swelling on his neck
the world becomesall blurred through his eyes but he pushes
suddenly the world starts to spin for him
he clutches his chest
hes ready to fall backwards but with the last gasp of willpower he gets himself to collapse forward on top of the hood
a doctor is listening to his heart with a stethoscope
blase is in a coma of sorts
hes muttering something
it sounds very much like refund
the doctor prepares an injection
blase and dave are sitting at the table
the doctor comes out of the bedroom
dave and mrs
blase stand up
well its not a stroke and he wont croak as we say
laughs at his own epigram and lights seriously evelyn
hes in terrible shape
hes a mack truck with rabbit engine
once hes up on his feet he better start using them
otherwise its taps city for him
well i got to go
dave looks guilty
i ruined everything
no you didnt
he needed a rest and now hes getting one
i dont think ill go to the race

i eep carrying it with me
one of these days therell be a new girl at the iga and when i want to cash a check shell ask me for some indentification and ill take out
my passport and say here

dave is moved by this gesture by the spirit of yearning for travel that it implies and by the knowledge that she will probably not go anywhere
l but she will not let him give her any sympathy
so i think you should go
you should come home singing with a trophy
you should do all that
while you can
i win this one for you mama
now that would be nice
we see mikes car with daves bike on top
theyare posing just like in the picture
people are taking pictures of them
they smile and wave making sure not to obscure the cinzano on their jersies as they do
we are proud to have with us today the famous team cinzano from italy
they are touring america and so far are undefeated
later on they have been kind enough to agree to hold a racing clinic which none of you should miss
hes in the crowd of other racers and like all of them his eyes are glued on the italians
dave is putting a banana and an apple in the back pocket of his jersey
other riders are doing likewise
almost all of them are taking bananas
everybody please move to the starting line
we see all kinds of legs
some are milky white
others are tanned
some are long and skinny
others short and bulging with muscles
one after another we see the riders rears meet the saddles of their bicycles
hes in the middle of the pack
he looks over his shoulder and waves to mike cyril and moocher on the sideline
they are in the front
they are looking straight ahead
riders ready timers ready
a gun is fired
the italians take off
we see the pack from the back as it moves forward slowly and then faster and faster the riders in the back working their way up
the huge pack of riders is now disappearing around a bend in the road
we pick up the last rider in the field and move past him
there are stragglers already individuals and little groups and then a large group
we move past them toward the italians dave and half a dozen other riders are in the lead group
they are separated from the rest by about half a mile
some riders in the group are eating their bananas
others are drinking water
they are approaching a hill
the italians shift their gears and like clockwork the rest of the riders do the same
the italians start sprinting up the hill the others pursue
strain is showing on everybody
we see the pack climbing the hill
the italians appear first
they look back over their shoulders and see nobody there
they nod to each other and continue over the crest shifting into a higher gear for the descent
dave and three riders appear over the crest
dave is in the lead
as he goes over the crest he shifts gears and starts to sprint
the other riders cannot match him
they are bent over their frames in their descent positions
their knees and elbows are tucked in and they are coasting down the hill
hes in the similar position only hes not coasting
hes pumping as hard as he can
they are still in their descent
the hill is steep and they are going very fast
suddenly dave bent over and breathing hard appears in the frame
he tries to appear that hes not tired
the italians look stunned
the st italian is annoyed
the zth italian seems amused
the italians are riding hard
the effort is showing on their faces
dave is behind them
he too is tired
but when the st italian looks back to see how dave is doing dave manages to smile
this seems to psyche the lst italian out
he gestures angrily to dave to take his turn up front
dave is thrilled at the command
he moves to the front
the following conversations will have to be subtitled
oggi fa caldo none vero
its hot today isnt it
roba da chiodi you dont say hes up front breaking wind for the others
hes working hard and hes tired
the italians behind him are likewise
dave swings off to let another rider pull in front
as he does dave once again smiles
he doesnt do this to fool them
hes just thrilled to be in their company
cho tempo para piovera
do you think itll rain
the nth italian tries to calm him down
not to la prenderel dont get yourself worked up
but the lst italian is upset
he wants to drop dave
but he doesnt want to kill himself doing it
the italians are switching off as they begin another ascent
its daves turn to take the lead
as he goes up front the st italian reaches in and pushes daves lever all the way forward
this suddenly shifts dave into a very high gear
he can hardly turn the cranks
the st italian smiles at him
he takes off
the other three follow him while dave fumbles around to get back in the right gear
he does not look happy
the camera moves back and we see dave at the front again
hes getting a little more serious
he sees a huge pothole in front of him
he rides right toward it and then at the last second he jerks his bike aside
the st italian goes right over the pothole
hes jarred and angry
dave looks back
the th italian appreciates this little reversal
the lst italian is getting a brutal look in his face
all five of them are continually taking turns being up front
they are approaching a small hill
the lst italian points to the hill
dave is too exhausted now to fake any smiles
the pace is as hard as its been
dave is up front
behind him we see the nd italian taking out his pump
dave pulls off to let him take the lead but as he does the lst italian pulls up behind him to block his way back
the rd italian sprints up front to block his way forward
dave is trapped
the rd italian puts on his brakes
dave puts on his to avoid running into him
as his speed slows down the nd italian sticks his pump into daves rear wheel
dave sees all this
in the split second that it takes he sees it all
his wheel collapses and dave tumbles off the road falling down the steep grade
the italians ride off
the th italian slows down a little to look at dave
he seems genuinely sorry about what happened but he too continues
he shouts after his teammates
hes a little angry
bravo bravo bella robal congratulations nice work his left leg is hurt but more than that his dream seems shattered
the tour italians are sprinting toward the finish line
a large finish sign flutters in the breeze
the th italian wins and as he does he turns and fives the italian finger to his three buddies
hes still angry at them
cyril mike and moocher look for dave
the crowd is cheering
all the guys are riding in silence
dave is crushed by his shattered italian dream
mendelsohns italian symphony is playing the second movement
they drive past the finish line of the race
the big cloth sign finish is still up fluttering in the wind
a man is taking it down
everybody else is gone
dave looks on heartbroken
i feel like one of those dwarfs you know
when they think that snow whites dead
mike turns to dave
so i guess youre just a cutter again like the rest of us
mikes car stops and lets moocher out
moocher is walking toward his house
he sees a
big sold sign tacked over the for sale sign
blase are sitting in the kitchen
no i dont feel lucky to be alive
i feel lucky im not dead
theres a difference
the door opens and dave limps inside
he looks terrible
blood is still caked up on his left leg
what happened to you
howre you feeling dad
blase cant believe hes being called dad
ill tell you how im feeling
ive had nightmares all night that everybody i ever sold a car to is going to come in and ask for a refund
and youll be there handing out the checks

im sorry i gave him back his money

everybody cheats dad
i just didnt know
blase is a little taken aback by this
he doesnt feel quite right about it
res a tiny bit ashamed
well now you know
so wheres the trophy
he cant help himself anymore
he bursts into tears and hugs his father
blase doesnt know what to do
his arms are out as if he doesnt know how to embrace
what is this

a little is all i asked for
whatre you crying for
youd think you lost your wallet or something
even strokes his hair a bit talk to him evelyn
he looks up at her and shes so touched by this show of affections that she too is crying
whatre you doing
blase shakes her head but she shakes it in a certain way that makes mr
blase a little troubled
he looks at her again
through her teas theres a little trace of a smile appearing
hes taking down the last italian poster and crumpling it up
the cat meows
you hungry jake is that it
we see mr
blase standing in the doorway looking at him
blase is driving
dave is next to him
x the campus is deserted
dave and mr
blase are walking slowly outside a huge classroom building
blase lights a cigarette

nobody told us that
but we just felt uncomfortable
id like to be able to stroll through the campus and look at the limestone but i feel out of place

blase puts outthe cigarette
puts arm around dave and heads back to the car
dave is on the telephone

a doorbell is heard
they sold any house and dave said i could stay here for a bit
dave hangs up the phone as cyril and moocher enter carrying moochers barbell set and a suitcase

the university bought my dads x house
there goes the neighborhood
mike is sitting in the car looking at daves room
hes got an unlit cigarette in his mouth and seems to be debating whether he should join the rest of the guys
all three guys are sleeping on the floor
cyril is in the middle
all are awake and silent
our years almost up
if anybodys got plans that dont include me
thats all right
ive got plans myself that dont include me

he tries to laugh but doesnt
puts one arm around moocher another one around dave and closes his eyes
dave and moocher are walking

maybe if she really likes you she wont care

dave is waiting outside a classroom building
his hair is combed in an american style now
students are coming out
katherine among them
she sees him and is stunned
what did you do to your hair
i liked it better before
you look like everybody else now
she starts to mess it up with her hands in order to comb it back into its original shape
the results are not flattering
i am everybody else
you look funny
you see katherine
i feel terrible
his italian accent is no longer in use and it makes katherine just a tiny bit nervous
you sound real funny tonight

i made it all up
i was born in bloomington
i went to bloomington high
i was the treasurer of the latin club and head of the ushers for our assembly programs

no i havent a clue
ill tell you what you are

but shes too upset to tell him anything
she runs inside the classroom
the doors close
dave stands still
the door opens
dave smiles as katherine reappears
she runs up to him and slaps him on the face and then runs back inside
his face changes from a guilt ridden sinner to one of almost anger
but there is a hint there of the hell with her theni ext
dave s house day mike is holding the little bike
its heavy and ungainly in comparison to daves italian racer
dave looks at the bike
mike cyril and moocher look at him
cant i even add some toe clips
no its official issue
they said you cant add or change a thing
its a piece of junkl but its got a nice personality
and its had its rabies shots already
i dont think it looks so bad
thats because you dont have to ride it
you dont have to either dave
were not going to beg you
plead perhaps but beg
we have our pride
the hell with it
at least we got invited
ill take it back
he starts to take the bike away
you actually seem relieved mike
you dont think we can win more do you
mike is silent
well maybe they are better
ive never heard you say that before
thatts because i never felt it before
my dad would be proud of you
our family motto is it cant be done
well see about that
he takes the bike from mike and starts wheeling it away
he gets on it and rides it into the garage
the guys look at each other
noise is heard coming from the garage
the entire bike is dismantled
the wheels are off
the bearings on the wheels are out
the cranks are off and the crankshaft has been removed
dave is holding the saddle in his hand
hes pushing down on it
its very hard
a cut to pouring olive oil into a large pan
the pan is on a hotplate
he puts the saddle into the pan and covers it
blase in the kitchen
truing one of the wheels
its in the truing stand and hes tightening the spokes with a spoke wrench
he spins the wheel
it spins fine
angle on dave garage x reassembling the rear wheel
putting grease on the ball bearings

dave is finishing the job by putting on handlebar tape
hes all dirty
the bike is clean
he looks at it
its much better now but his face suggests that its still what it is
dave is riding his little bike
hes testing the bike as well as himself and trying to get used to the new machine
he tries sprinting and in mid spring he stops pedaling
his hand grasps his left leg
hes in pain
he drops his foot off the pedal and shakes his leg as if trying to shake out a cramp
katherine is walking slowly through the deserted town
she turns the corner and sees dave sitting on the curb
his little bike is leaning against the parking meter
she looks at him
wonders whether to say anything
he stands up quickly
hes stunned to see her here
whatre you doing here
they both half smile at each other
now dave shrugs
i dont know
i got a job in chicago
moochers dad in chicago
he waves this remark away
and im going to italy after all
with my parents
dave almost slips into an italian gesture
i wish you a nice trip
im not going anywhere
i dont know about that
x she walks away
dave and moocher are having meat and potatoes
blase is comtemplating halt a head of lettuce and some crackers
blase is at the stove
if you eat so much moocher how come youre so damn small

dave looks back at his father
dave jumps up and hugs his mother
you must be very happy mr
of course i must
you think i have any choice
you said you were going to give them a pep talk
they dont need pep
i need pep

blase opens a kitchen drawer and takes out some folded t shirts
since youre going to be out there you
might as well tell them who you are
he looks at dave
the crowd is cheering as various teams enter to take their designated pit areas
a triumphal march is playing
they are entering the stadium
dave is pushing his bike along
we see them from the back
the word cutters is stamped on the back of their t shirts
there is something comical about this team
they are so uneven
cyril is very tall
moocher is very short
they are walking out of step
all the other teams are matched in height to accommodate the use of a bike w
th a set saddle position
they seem very nervous
the roar of the crowd
the other teams
the foreign turf once again
mike seems the most nervous of all
they walk past rods team
rod is smiling and staring at mike
mike looks away
the crowd is hushed
gentlemen mount your bicycles
a great roar is heard
a pace car is leading the field around the track for one lap
dignitaries from the campus sit in the pace car mr
the pace car is going faster
the starter waves the flag as they go past him
the car speeds up and gets off the track
the race is on
the riders begin their mad scramble for positions
the entire width of the track is taken up by them
rod is in first place
dave is dead last but trying to move up
hes riding and looking for openings
a little space offers itself he shoots through it and moves up
as everyone goes wide on the first turn he takes it on the inside and moves up some more
cyril moocher and mike are beating on each other in their excitement
hes moving up
look at that angle on lap ceiart a big board with flip numbers shows laps to go
a man is reaching out to change the number
as the riders come around he flips it to laps to go
blase is sitting inside a car
the radio is on
the local station is announcing the race
blase s car mr
blase has a huge noble roman bag stuffed with french x fries and pizza
hes stuffing himself and listening
on radio and so after twenty five laps the perennial favorites are up front
sigma nu phi kappa psi sigma alpha epsilon
and here comes
blase hits the car horn
dave is moving upto catch the leaders
behind him is a black rider
they catch the leaders and there are now five teamsup front
as they come around to the pit areas we see three riders from the fraternities swinging off for an exchange
as they enter their pit area they slam on their brakes and while the bike is still moving they jump off while a fresh rider jumps on
daveis in the lead for a while but the fresh riders catch up
rod is sitting and resting
hes breathing hard
his fellow riders are slightly out of breath too
he wont last
he ill last
stop saying last almost despite herself shes getting caught up in daves progress
shes trying not to
hes beginning to hurt
his left leg is bothering him
as he goes around the turn
his left foot slips off the pedal
he almost loses his balance but recovers
on radio its amazing
after twenty five miles thats one hundred laps folks
revised bambino a
on radio the lead rider for the cutter team is still on his bike without an exchange
his name is dave blase
thassa my boy
his car is running and he floors it while it idles and hits the horn again grabbing the wheel as if he were in a race himself
on radio and hes pulling ahead
hes actually pulling ahead
there x she
wants to yell
but cant bring herself to do it
hes going all out
hes in terrible pain but hes about fifty yards ahead of his pursuers
as he approaches his pit area he waves for help and raises a
were number onel no he wants off
thats the signal
hes going to go one more lap
you mean one of as
once again i say oopsl mike looks frightened
really pouring it on now
the president of the university is looking through binoculars
well i had no idea
thats the fastest white boy ive ever seen
hes coming around the turn and he swings off and heads to his pit area
we see moocher cyril and mike
all of them are panicking
they seem to be pushing each other forward
nobody wants to be the one to get on the bike
into this panic dave roars in with his bike
he slams on the brakes
his left leg gives way and he falls
moocher and cyril run to help him up
mike is left holding the bike
mike is frozen
weve got a lead dammit
but the crowd the other riders staring at him the pressure of the moment is too much for mike
he just stands there
the lead that they had is evaporating
the other riders are catching up
they are coming around the curve
moocher runs up to mike pushes him away and gets on the bike
his intentions are great but his legs are short
he cant sit in the saddle and reach the pedals
so he stands and rides just as the other teams come around
rod is smiling
hes standing up and going for all hes got
but the other teams are pulling away
hes driving at full speed and listening to the radio
on radio its sigma nu phi kappa psi sigma alpha epsilon
the cutters are fading but it was some try
dave blase seems to be hurt
the first aid team has reached him
blase drives past the house
he slows down as if wondering whether to pick up his wife but then he speeds up again
blase is entering the stadium through a turnstile
blase is standing not far away looking at him
he doesnt see her right away
as he turns they look at each other
he is surprised to see her there
he sure tried
even the announcer said so
he is genuinely proud
too bad he
the lead r iders pass
lagging behind them moocher comes in for an exchange
cyril takes the bike
his legs are so long his knees just about hit his chin but he takes off in pursuit
moocher is exhausted
mike looks on
i vl kole wheres
mike points across the track
dave is in the center of the field applying medication from a first aid station
its all over
bent over his bike like some human stork hes doing the best he can
he goes past pit area
some of the people in the crowd laugh
dave is with mike and moocher now
hes got adhesive tape in his hands and is contemplating bandaging up his leg
rod rides past them in the lead
mike looks at him
rod looks at mike
three black guys are planning strategy
they see rod getting off the bike
looks like theyre going to save rod for the sprint
you get on when he does
stay behind him until the last turn
moocher is exhausted
dave is depressed as hell
he s got adhesive tape in his hand but he doesnt feel like putting it on his
the race seems lost
cyril comes in for an exchange
mike is the only one who can take the bike
he grabs it
cyril collapses near dave
cyril seems quite happy
were doing better than i thought we would
res riding like a bull
he goes too hard and drifts out in the turns
he almost runs into pit one where rod is resting and watching him
he gets back in the groove
moocher and cyril are sitting together looking quite satisfied
dave looks at them
hes standing on the infield and waving his cap at mike as he goes by
cmon you cutter
he sees his parents on the infield opposite their pit area
they are waving to him proud of what hes done
nancy has come into the pit area and is congratulating them
ive never seen anyone try so hard
im so proud of you

dave jumps up
his frustration almost makes bism look angry
anybody can tryl is p
he sees dave waving to him to come in
mike looks nearly spent
dave is waving at mike to come in
mike is coming in too fast but manages to break
he is totally spent as he gets off the bike
dave gets on the bike
moocher runs up and holds dave in place
cyril starts putting the adhesive tape around his feet taping them to the pedal
whats going on
its like charlton heston in
theyre going to lap us
the black riders look up astonished
dave rides past their pit
rod sees dave go past him
the rider for his team is not far behind him
cmonl cmonl you got him
blase and mrs
blase are standing on the track
both look stunned to see him back on the bike
x go son go damn youl mr
blase looks at her surprised by her outburst
dave x rides past them
moocher cyril and mike are jumping up and down
nets coming around
he is gaining and making up lost ground
they too are shouting something but dave no longer hears hem
the italian music is playing through his head
its irresistable and he gives himself over to it for one last time
he no longer hears the crowd shouting nor anything else except the music and music seems to be carrying him forward
his face registers the emotion of hearing it
of giving himself over to it
and of a kind of farewell toit
the three black riders look at each other
they need a new plan they seem to be thinking
rod and his teammates are watching daves progress
they shake their heads
he cant possibly catch up
it shows laps to go
now all three riders are looking back over their shoulders
they see dave coming on
rod is getting ready to take an exchange for his final sprint
we see the black sprinter in pit area getting ready to take an exchange too
he and rod look at each other
the black sprinter get their bikes at the same time and start to accelerate
he passes the third rider from the lead group
ahead of him he sees rod and the black rider
it shows one lap to go
a man is waving a flag signaling the last lap
rod and the black guy go past him
dave is behind them and gaining
rod and the black rider are riding abreast now
he sees them right in front of him
the italian music is still playing as he catches up to them and pulls up behind rod whos riding on the inside
they are going around the curve
rod drifts out a bit and thats all the room that dave needs
he takes the inside edge as they come around for the final stretch
all three of them stand up and begin their final sprint
it looks dead even as theyre approaching the finish line
a man is waving the checkered flag
then with about forty yards to go dave suddenly explodes ahead and wins by an inch or so
he raises his arms in the air
cyril moocher and mike are running toward dave
they are jubilant
they jump on dave knocking him down
mikes brother runs up and
theres a look of family pride as they embrace
nancy runs up to moocher
shes still wearing her waitress uniform
she practically lifts him off the ground
daves parents rush past them
everybody is shouting
the crowd is cheering
confetti is falling
hes happy but he feels left out
everybody is hugging and getting hugged except for him
katherine is watching the celebration
she looks at dave and then she looks at rod not far away
then she turns slowly and leaves bidding a farewell in a way to a portion of her life
dave and his parents are walking off
mike and his brother are arm in arm
moocher and nancy are holding hands and going their way
hes holding the four trophies they won
he is trying to swagger but he doesnt know where to go
the guys seem to be going in separate directions and he doesnt know whom to follow
the camera pulls back from him
confetti is falling everywhere
wind is blowing it around the stadium
the branches are swaying in the wind
leaves are golden yellow and falling off swirling through the air falling on the road
mikes car goes through
the leaves as he drives up an entrance ramp onto a throughway
a cowboy hat
cigarette is in his
he looks back at a sign you are now leaving bloomington
he lights his cigarette
a highway stretches in front of him
its been retitled cutter cars ltd
blase quite pregnant now is sweeping the leaves
blase is getting on the bike ready to leave
the leaves are falling off here too and blowing in the wind
students are going to and from classes
we see dave among them pushing his bike along
hes wearing a phi kappa psi jacket
he looks quite collegiate and he seems to know it
but its fall and fall makes you think of other days and dave seems to be doing just that
a girl walks up to him
she seems quite lost
she speaks with a definite french accent
do you know where is the office of the pursar
dave looks at her
some of his collegiate exterior fades as he smiles at her
french music begins to play
oh you mean the bursars office
youre french eh
hes riding through the campus looking around
his son goes to school and he looks and feels that he has a right to be there
theyre riding double on daves bicycle
shes carrying his books
the book on top is beginning french
french is my major
its just my first year of course
have you ever seen le tour de france
he gives it his best french accent
not oh mon dieu
but the french riders
they are the bestl pouladoirl anquetill not only his accent but his gestures are becoming french
riding toward him on his bike is mr
he sees dave and waves
hello there big shot
bon jour papa
blase turns and looks back
his face registers mixed emotions but the overriding one is one of acceptance
dave turns to the girl
we freeze on his french gesture
