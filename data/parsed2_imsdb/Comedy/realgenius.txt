in a black b bomber banks steeply exposing its underside to us
slingshot this is watchdog
rolling out of its bank the bomber begins a steep climb revealing the fact that it is carrying a small delta winged shuttle on it back
the bombers wings slide back
understand we are go for crossbow
suddenly a rocket engine on the back of the modified bomber fires thrusting the plane into steep climb
the plane vibrates
the pilot and co pilot are busy in their seats
behind them sits a third pilot wearing a space suit
he gives them a thumbs up signal rises and crawls to the rear
into the mike over the roar watchdog slingshot
let us know when the rabbits in the hole
a blond haired blue eyed man with a small walkie talkie is standing in the midst of a group of cheering central american peasants and townsfolk
he is disguised as one of them
the uniformed president of this formerly sleepy now strategically critical nation is waving to his people
he is flanked by military guards
he turns and walks into the villa
the bomber approaches the top of its arc
the shuttle pilot climbs into his seat straps in and checks his instruments
all systems check
crossbow is armed
roger ignition sequence start separation in five
the explosive bolts blow on the shuttle mount
the pilot pushes his yolk forward
as the bomber falls way the shuttles booster ignites with a roar thrusting it toward space
we see a tiny glowing speck coming towards us
very quickly it gains in altitude and we see that it is the shuttle
suddenly it is upon us and blasts over our heads
we follow the shuttle
the engine stops
there is a small explosion which pushes the booster rocket away
small maneuvering rockets fire and the shuttle establishes itself in a nose down altitude
crossbow is established
roger we have ground confirmation
reference grid seven
check pathfinder on
roger im going on the scope
moving target indicator engage
behind and above the cockpit a large hatch opens and a large circular spinning mirror rises and locks into position
the pilot reaches above him and pulls down a viewfinder and begins looking through it
a target sighting lens moves from right to left stops and then moves back but this time with the mirror moving in unison
while still looking through the viewfinder the pilot manipulates the targeting controls
crosshairs a grid patter and digital rangefinder readouts appear over various parts of the earths topography as the pilot searches for his target
then it steadies on a polarized image of a group of people
one of the images seems to stand out brighter than the others
the president and his aide are chatting with a group of visiting dignitaries
there is a jovial atmosphere as they order drinks from a waiter
the president is proudly displaying one of his medals to his guests
it has a very unique jewel like object in its middle
the pilot is watching through the viewfinder
into mike scanner on
the mirror and sighting lens adjust as they track the target
the president is served a cup of coffee
he asks the waiter for sugar
the waiter turns back to his cart
the pilot puts his hands on the joysticks and flips open the trigger covers
nice and easy does it
dead silence then the mirror erupts in brilliant light and sends an incredibly bright beam toward the earth
behind the shuttle we see exhaust gases venting in giant plumes into space
the beam strikes the president like the finger of god
the waiter turns back with the asked for sugar to find a smoking hole where the president once stood
the shuttle finishes its work and the beam shuts down
the mirror folds away and the shuttle arcs across the screen preparing for re entry firing small retro rockets
im coming home
just like shooting ducks in a barrel
a large screen at one end of the room continues to show the re entry
the crossbow project
theres no defense like a good offense
in the middle of the room is a giant donut of a round conference table
another circle hangs above and casts light downward in such a way as to light the table top but caser those sitting around it in shadow
we can see them but not well
there are six men in suits
the look is sinister as hell but the talk is for rotary club meeting
a man sitting at three oclock wearing an air force majors uniform points at a remote control device at the screen and stops the film
the lighting does not change
he turns to the man sitting at twelve oclock
nice little weapon isnt it dave
well i guess so but gosh don its a movie
you want me to start buying weapons from george lucas
polite laughter all around
now that would be somethin wouldnt it
well sometimes i think i might as well
to one of the others what do you think of what you saw roy
i think there werent enough girls
more polite laughter
then roy turns ice cold in a flash
roy contd is this thing for biological targets only
no sir this thing would take the skin right off of air force one if you wanted
not that im saying wed ever want to kill our own president but you know for example
our studies indicate that this type of weapon is totally useless for warfare
its not intended for use in your kind of warfare roy
this is a perfect peace time weapon
whats the kill potential
as soon as the size to power ratio is licked well have about seven bangs for the buck
carmichael shrugs the sign for who knows
seriously don i have to report to the secretary that everythings on schedule
we have plans for your little rays gun this summer
trying to cover as i understand it guys theres some major practical difficulties
im pushing as hard as i can
well don you tell those geniuses youve got until the end of the next fiscal quarter to come up with a working model or im pulling the plug on the
very nervous im assured theyre on the verge of a major breakthrough
just as long as we get a working weapon out of it by june
i wouldnt know dave
i havent had a working weapon since korea
to assistant larry lets see the film on blinding techniques then well have some lunch all right
we open on a sign effects of marijuana on rodents
a cage is divided in half
one side is marked no marijuana
a chinchilla is running furiously on a treadmill
the other side is marked marijuana
a chinchilla is lying in a little hammock
dolly back to wide shot
we see we are in a large hall
there are dozens of booths and exhibits
a banner strung across the hall lets us know that this is the western regional high school winter science fair
angle on a pretty female student at a booth standing in front of a clear glass cylinder that has vacuum hoses connected to it
there are two colored gases inside the cylinder
a sign behind her says how tornados are formed
a small group of boys stand watching her in as sexist a way as possible
it doesnt seem to be working but if it was these gases would be going around
we dont care
angle on another part of the hall
two blond haired male twins stand proudly in their booth
the gravitational pull of heavenly bodies
a large crudely painted diorama of the milky way is in the background
several painted balls are suspended in front labeled mercury venus etc
the sun is represented by a large electromagnet
all the planets angle on a booth near the entrance
a robot attracts a crowd
it has a video screen for a face which reads hi my name is harry
let me guess your weight and age
with jerky motions he extends his mechanical arms and shakes hands with passersby
he is speaking to a small kid
hi my name is harry
let me guess your weight and age
midget mutant weight
the kid shoots it in the neck with a toy space gun
the robot short circuits sparks shoot out its arms fly in circles until a fuse blows and it sizzles to a burning stop
we pan over to the door just in time to see the entrance of dr
jerry atherton professor of physics at pacific tech and a popular host of a pbs television show about science
his manner and bearing mark him as a classic anal retentive
he is a perfect cross between carl sagan and jerry brown
brilliant intense seemingly sincere but in fact incredibly manipulative
there is an intentional aura of superiority surrounding him
we follow him in and down an aisle where he draws the attention of the crowd in the manner of the celebrity he is
an old lady stops him
he beams a smile at her
are you dr
i just love your television show
well thank you
whats albert einstein really like
oh i thought you had him on
no that was just an actor
is everyone an actor then
beginning to tire of this no im a physicist
but einstein isnt
dismissing her nice talking to you
he walks away
angle on a booth where we meet mitch simon aged fifteen
mitch is a genius
hes known that since he was old enough to understand the word which was on his first birthday
he was doing college level work by the time he was in the fourth grade
although hes intellectually precocious hes still only years old and has all the problems of any average adolescent
his shyness and intellect have always made him feel different and uncomfortable in social situations
he stands with his parents near a demonstration table
unlike some of the other exhibits weve seen there is nothing amateurish about this one
in fact it is an impressive display of a dye laser
we can see the beams of multi colored rays bouncing between mirrors moving through liquids combining with gases
mitch is trying to explain his work to mr
simon who is a nice enough guy but who pretty much regards the fact that his son is gifted as a pain in the butt
see dad its coherent light
he is seen by mrs
simon who greets him
atherton what a surprise
how are you
no problem with mitchs test scores or anything is there
i just thought id stop by bring you the good news myself
i just got word from the admissions committee
we did it
mitch is in
isnt that wonderful
to mitch hello mitch
nice little display
thanks whats your medium
but i have it all structured for hf if i could get some
that would be interesting
its all theoretical at this stage but i have the power supply completely worked out
a kid again thanks
atherton turns to mitchs parents
you must be very proud
hes the first student weve ever accepted for winter term entrance at pacific tech
i image hes the youngest too
the youngest weve had was a twelve but he cracked under the pressure within six months so we dont really count him
almost in tears fifteen year old and off to college
this scholarship thing does he get any kind of whatya call it signing bonus sort of thing
hoping this is not going to be a problem well no
but by allowing mitch to progress at an accelerated rate we give him the opportunity to fulfill a far greater portion of his remarkable intellectual potential
dont you agree
yeah i guess
its just that athletes get you know cars and stuff
polite for mitchs sake well i guess we scientists are a little different than athletes
smarter not when it comes to getting cars
we just want the best for mitchie
changing gears dr
atherton i saw your show the other night about radioactive isotopes and i have a question for you
is that your real hair
well i wondered that too
struggling for manners well interesting question when you consider the philosophical aspects of whether anything on television is real or actually just an image being broadcast
didnt look real
anyway listen i got to get something to eat or im gonna die
come on lets look for something
they start away
simon contd i saw over there one of the kids was doing an experiment with insect protein
did you see anyone doing anything with corned beef
nice theyre okay
they just sometimes dont have any idea of what im talking about
im sure of that
afraid youre going to miss your friends
i dont have any
i think i intimidate other kids
i dont want to
remember compared to you most people have the iq of a carrot
were different than most people mitch but you should be proud of that
i mean look around
from now on youll be amongst peers colleagues
i suppose i might as well tell you now ive put you on my personal research team
some of the finest minds on campus not the least of which is of course my own
it sounds great
well now im expecting great things from you my boy
this is only the second time ive given this honor to a freshman
the first was
you know chris
no but hes a legend in the physics club
well youre going to become a legend yourself
youll be working with chris
hes a senior now but hes still on the team and still as brilliant as ever
we see chris kinsley chris has on his head a pair of those jiggling antennae like things
we pull back to revel that he is on a tour of the facilities
a huge hanger like room filled with workers constructing and assembling scientific instruments
this place has the look and feel of the big time
workers put the finishing touches on a communication satellite
passing through this disneyland of science is a well dressed executive
robert jensen who is guiding chris on the tour
chris was heralded as one of the smartest people to ever enter pacific tech
he proved to be even smarter than many of his professors
he also proved to be one of the most outrageous people to ever enter pacific tech
his antics are legend
unimpressed with authority pomposity and bullshit in general
chris dresses on the sloppy side of life
currently hes wearing a sports jacket thats seen better days over a faded sweatshirt that has the logo i
they approach a second executive scientist mike dodd who is wearing a lab coat and a beautiful public relations executive named sherry nugil who is also wearing a lab coat
but in a whole new way
as they approach the couple guys i want you to meet chris kinsley
chris this is sherry nugil my assistant and mike dodd
hes the man who just designed the new telcom satellite here
nice to meet you dr
isnt the telcom raining debris all over europe
smiling but angry that was a launch problem not a design problem
why are you wearing that toy on your head
chris takes the thing from his head
sorry i was worried that people would think i was stuffy you know no fun all brain no penis pardon
im sorry its just an infantile response to authority
you are chris kinsley arent you
i mean i used to be
now im mhavishnue kinsley
relieved i see
you are being funny
well i just cant help it
youre such a fun guy yourself
i think youll find we all are right mike
now chris sherry is going to show you around the place
she can answer any questions you might have about fringe benefits or dress codes or anything and ill see you back upstairs when youre done okay
sherry take good care of this young man
hes one of the ten finest minds kin the country
someday i hope to be two of them
see you later
jensen and dodd exit
you are very beautiful
you dont act like one of the top ten minds in america
how many of them have you met
with a really dirty look in her eye seven
youll be eight
six was professor hostetler at m
old professor hostetler
isnt he dead
he is now
sherry and chris stare intently into one anothers eyes
and so coupled with full insurance coverage and bonus plans you find it adding up to a fairly sizable perks package
i have a pretty sizable perks package right now
also we understand that you people dont care too much for rigid timetables and thats pretty rare in private industry
so are you
is it true that school of yours keeps getting smarter and smarter kids every year
i mean no
you see the funding associations are the same
our theoretical work is in the blue sky sector as well
you have no idea how much i need that kind of continuity in my life right now
you just belong here chris
we have several of dr
athertons former students and theyre all doing quite well with us
what number was he
one of his other students was four
can we go somewhere
the giant dish of a huge radio telescope faces heavens
between kisses talk smart to me
they are lying in the middle of the dish
passion mounts fingers cope with belts and buttons clothing falls away my god these people are having sex
please i need it
what was your favorite course
i guess right now id have to say fluid mechanics
responding to something interesting sherry just did with her hips and gym
whats your research with artherton
ultra high power laser as an energy force for fusion
tremendous boon to all mankind
and womankind too
fusion more fusion
its the process for obtaining enormous amounts of energy from forms of hydrogen like deuterium and tritium
oh my god more
extracting the fuels is no problem
getting them to combine and release the energy is the problem
oohh yes it takes temperatures of million degrees celsius
it is an impressive campus of older california spanish building mixed with modern architectural marvels
this is the sunday before the beginning of the winter term
we pick up mitch simon and follow him as he crosses campus
he is wearing a tie and jacket which only adds to his general sense of being out of place
he is carrying a map which he stops to consult every now and again
he stops an upper classman and asks him a question while pointing at the map
the older asks him a question while pointing at the map
the older student takes great delight in turning the map right side up
the tasteful and elegant official residence of the universitys president
mitch approaches the open front door where he is greeted by mrs
im looking for reading from the invitation in his hand the presidents freshman tea
leading him inside oh good
im so glad we have one then
who are you
they pass through on their way to the backyard
youre the special case
i know gene wants to meet you
youre just in time for his traditional talk
would you like a glass of sherry
im a minor
aha well of course you are
that would explain your height
they exit out onto the patio
the returning freshman class has gathered for a social
mitch is the only one in a tie
he stands on the patio with mrs
meredith whose husband the apparently ever jovial professional academic administrator is about to speak to the assembled
people if i might get your attention
the din begins to quiet
welcome back freshmen
i take it you all put the christmas break to good use
there is good natured jeering
now if youll indulge me id like to speak seriously for a moment
you will recall that when i welcomed you to the pacific institute of technology a few short months ago i spoke of how we are one of the finest scientific
institutions in the world
i think the finest
i mentioned our six nobel prize winners our members of the national academy of sciences and our members of the national academy of engineering
this is an intellectual oasis of technological achievement in the dessert of general academic mediocrity we see inmost colleges and universities today
there is some applause and good natured banter
mitch is truly moved
this environment is exactly what mitch has hoped for all his life
i also spoke of the fact that you are the finest freshmen class we have ever had here
there are cheers and applause
i say this to every freshman class
each year we raise our entrance requirements and each year there is a group of students like you who meet and surpass those requirements
almost jubilant cheering and clapping
as you have no doubt already noticed by now over a third of you are gone
by the end of the year another third of you will have followed them out of eden and into mediocrity
the crowd goes deathly silent as meredith continues in his cherry manner
we want only the best
hard work and high standards are expected of everyone
and if you arent up to it cal tech or m
might take you but you dont fit in here
let me remind you that this place is an opportunity not a right a chance not a gift a working lunch not a picnic
several waitresses begin serving tea but the despair of reality creeps over the students and they begin to disperse
mitch stands waiting for the approaching dr
gene this is mitch simon
oh yes professor arthertons bright star
and i understand youre already on his project
im assured youre going to do great things
i hope so
let me give you some advice
dont screw up
i guess i better go now
he walks away
watching mitch with satisfaction i think the young people really appreciate my getting down verbally dont you
once again mitch map in hand must ask another student for directions
this one also turns the map right side up and then points to the building they are standing in front of
as he heads for it he passes a bronze bust of one of the founding fathers dr
the students have decorated him with a muffler earmuffs and carrot nose to look like a snowman
mitch walks down a long corridor
he passes several open doors that reveal laboratories with all kinds of scientific equipment all over them
mitch stops in front of a closed door
he checks the number then looks down at a card in his hand
he turns the card right side up
he opens the door to reveal a darkened lab
in the darkness there is a veritable light show of laser beams
a voice calls out from the darkness
come in here
mitch enters quickly and shuts the door behind himself
in the instrument glow we can make out the forms of three other students
they are kent carter and bodie members of dr
athertons research team
just leave the sandwiches and go
no yoda yeah you
i dont have any ah
well then what good are you
what are we supposed to eat
getting a little fed up how about my shorts
who do you think youre talking to
the laser snaps off and the lights snap on
the glare is a little intense at first
are you from the restaurant or not
with the lights on we get a chance to have a better look at the team
kent is an elitist intellectual snob with very little imagination who likes to think of himself as athertons protege
he wears braces on his teeth because he knows how important a proper smile can be in the marketplace
im mitch simon
im a student
atherton told me to come up here
oh youre the new stud are you
or is it dud
how do you mean
youre the twelve year old right
does your body know that
mitch attempts a good natured laugh
its not a great attempt
are you expecting him or
can i get you something
are any of you guys chris kinsley
they all freeze
no thank god
hey kent i hear kinsley got that pei job all locked up
i wanted that job
because it starts at fifty thousand a year thats why
plus travel car stock options
well im supposed to have a look at your work up to date
check it over
check it over
mistakes i guess
he said you guys are stuck
the room goes rigid
evidently this little punk of an upstart needs to be told what christ died for
lets get something very clear here
everything youve heard about the supportive student body and the honor code might hold for the rest of the campus but it doesnt count for squat in here
which means when jerrys not here you do what i say
from god to jerry to me get it
ive told you before kent you dont get to use my first name
to mitch good to see you mitch
to the group im sure youre all going to become fast friends
were well on our way already
good because after mitch is brought up to date i want the rest of you to take your cues from him
hell be in charge of the group
i mean good choice jerry
youre doing it again kent
he didnt bother to come in today
he said he didnt feel like it and then i said you better and then he said or what
and then i said or hed get the heck and then he said jam it its sunday and he looks for god on sundays so i said okay but im
thank you bodie
i notice youve stopped stuttering
yes ive been giving myself some sock treatment and its working
to mitch im sorry he isnt here
i wanted you to meet your hero
look at this
he points to a table full of laser equipment comprised of various angled mirrors and gas cambers and drib units
the others gather around it
carter contd we heard he wasnt coming in
kent and i figured wed go ahead and run his section without him
and we started getting picosecond ratings that arent even in the ballpark
it looks like itll take at least a week to re do all this and start again
mitch is carefully studying the equipment and checking some notes that were on the table
another costly mistake
are you sure
reading from notes negative
innocently to carter and kent theres a mistake all right but i think you guys made it
look you inverted the last two steps
grabbing the notes i dont make mistakes
damnit dont touch other peoples things
adjusting the equipment this shouldnt take too long to fix
im glad that you were here mitch
yes thanks for pointing out carters mistake mitch
dont bother with that now
im sure you want to go get settled
relieved well it has been kind of a long day
atherton starts to leave
oh i forgot kent i need your help
get copies made of everything so young mitch here can get started checking everything tomorrow
and then on your way back stop at my cleaners
dont give it a thought
i enjoy it
to mitch shall we
atherton exits followed by mitch
i guess it goes from god to jerry to you to the cleaners right kent
mitch enters the arched column portico of this dormitory building
the room is small cramped and more than a little disheveled
pei nasa and science fiction posters hang on the ceiling and wall over and around one of the two beds
junk food and soft drink containers are littered everywhere
in one corner is a fully stocked frito lay chip display
mitch crosses to his bed and sits
he is exhausted and depressed
the door opens and mitch see a strange tall bulkily built hermit looking kind of a guy enter
he is carrying a mcdonalds bag
he stops when he see mitch and stares at him in a quirky way for a second then crosses to the closet opens the door and exits into it
getting no response mitch rises goes to the closet opens it and looks in
there is no one there
what kind of place is this
mitch crosses to his luggage
he opens a bag and to his surprise he finds it empty
he then looks in the other bag and find theyve all been cleaned out
puzzled he shuts the bags
suddenly the door swings open and chris kinsley who we saw earlier at pei enters
hes dragging a large piece of mechanical equipment
it is in fact a baseball pitching machine
hey you just gonna sit there admiring the room or are you going to help me with this
what is this thing
its a penis stretcher
you want to try it out
well congratulations then no its an iron mike
a baseball pitching machine
chris is setting it up
i was here for a second this morning
frightened you didnt straighten the place up did you
looks around at the mess no
cause all my filths in alphabetical order
chris puts on a baseball cap and grabs a bat
anyway i dropped off my luggage and now all my bags are empty
a ball is pitched
chris connects and the ball smashes through the window
i put your stuff away for you
he smashes a ball into a wall
its all in the bottom drawer
shirts pants underwear shoes
i had a little trouble with your sport jacket so i threw it out
nah only kidding
this ones for you little johnny
he whacks another pitch
he does a crowd cheer and circles the bases
what a game
im chris kinsley
atherton is riding in a rental car with don carmichael a government contract monitor
these two guys are part of an old boy network involved with research and development
were falling way behind jer
well were not making cheese sandwiches here you know don
thats a good one
ill have to remember to use that jer
the new boy is quick
he better be because the company needs a practical working model within four months
you cant dictate innovation
let me put this another way jer
you know all that money weve been spending for development
yes well when a project gets cut off the finance boys always run an audit
the car pulls up to athertons house where there is a great deal of construction going on
once the work is completed this is going to be beautifully restored rather large victorian home
looking out having a little work done on the old place are you
mitch is gathering up some books
he looks at a chart on the wall
the door to the room opens while mitch is looking the other way
we catch a glimpse of the same tall bulkily built man opening mitchs closet door and disappearing inside
mitch turns just in time to see the door close
he goes into it opens it and looks inside
he goes to the door of his room
mitch opens the door steps into the hall and slips landing on his ass
his books go flying
the hall floor is covered with ice wall to wall
skating music is playing on a cassette somewhere
a few students dressed for winter are skating
chris skates over and helps mitch to his feet
welcome to pacific techs smart people on ice
he whirls away leaping from wall to wall sliding quickly down the ice
he stops in front of a short roly poly kid of japanese descent mark ickagami better know as ick
ick is a bio chemist who spends a great deal of time in his lab experimenting with various fun compounds that do things ranging from making artificial ice to increasing
with a proletariat accent ice turned out real good ick
yeah it worked
what did you use
teasing oh sure i tell you then you tell somebody else and the next thing you know were in the middle of another ice age
yelling down the hall come on people
just cause youre a slack kinsley
moles and trolls
moles and trolls
work work work work
i plan this for weeks
i go to a lot of trouble and all they want to do is study
i know thats its not like me but im sorry
im starting to get discouraged people
we had nobody at the mutant hamster races one entry in the madame curie look alike contest and he was disqualified later
why do i even bother
chris skates off
to ick how does he do it
well im not an expert but i think he puts one foot in front of the other and pushes
the horsing around
the never studying
i know hes smart
but nobodys that smart
i dont know how smart he is
before he even came here he invented a solar battery which laid the groundwork for the system that provides the energy for amarillo at half the cost
hed be a millionaire today if he been smart enough to make them pay for it
how he pulls the grades i dont know
just then roaring down the hall face down on a sled comes jordans cochran
she is an advanced engineering student with great theoretical and mechanical skill who can never seem to pitched energy of a hyper kinetic kindergarten class
she crashes at mitchs feet
he reaches down to help her
no not emotionally no im not
not terribly but still it should have gone much further much faster
its okay though i know what the problem is thats simple its obviously the drag coefficient ill just have to re design the blades
i can do that thats easy
i can do that here but i have to cut then after theyre designed that takes tools that takes time
how long is this stuff going to last do you know
maybe another half an hour
thats great thats good
i can do that no problem lots of time
to mitch whats your name
mitch thanks for the help
and in a flash she is gone
to ick who was that
jordan rushes back
to mitch im jordan i realized id forgotten to tell you my name its jordan
i heard there was going to be someone new this term are you a freshman
do you have a bed
oh i was going to make you one if you needed it but you dont so thats okay
well i gotta go ill see you later probably
see you ick see you mitch
as she races off kent enters carrying several binders
whats all this suppose to be
this is new kind of shovel
mitch finds this very funny and reacts accordingly by laughing
kent cant stand to be laughed at
dumping the binders into mitchs hands this should keep you busy for awhile
this plus your regular class load should turn your brains to mush in a month
kent we were going to name you king of the winter carnival
to ick i suppose youre in on this too
did you make this stuff
im not saying
whos going to clean it up
dont have to
its going to go from solid form directly to gas
impressed by this fairly uncommon phenomenon really
what is it
im not saying
but i can tell you that its fairly rare and very unstable
youre all a bunch of degenerates
what about that time i caught you naked with a bowl of jello
i was hot and i was hungry
look kinsley youre not number one anymore
number one what
pointing to mitch mighty mouse here beat your placement scores by over twenty points
i guess you think youre pretty hot stuff
uncomfortable unsure if this is real well
no i mean hey
maybe you are smarter than me but can you do this
chris pushes himself off backwards and slides along the ice in an attempt at a fancy figure skating move
just as hes about to finish he crashes to the floor at the precise moment that the floor turns into a cloud of rising gas
chris disappears in the cloud
excited it worked
teasing now if we can just keep it from exploding
kent runs away
from inside the growing cloud hey ick
is it okay to breathe this stuff
the cloud fills the screen
perfect morning light streams through the window making even this dump look beautiful
chris is asleep in a strange position on his bed proving that even asleep he is eccentric
we pan across the room to mitch
he has obviously fallen asleep while reading the binders that kent had given him the night before
we hear the sound of the door opening followed by some heavy footsteps
this causes mitch to wake up
it takes him a second to realize where he is
he sits up
again we catch just a glimpse of that same mysterious figure opening the closet door
he is holding a mcdonalds bag
he closes the door behind him
to say the least hes thrown by this strange intrusion
he waits a beat listening
nothing happens so he gets up and crosses to the closet looks inside
theres nothing in there but clothes
mitch pushes the garments aside and finds just a wall
he shakes his head
this is getting frustrating
he exits the room
mitch crosses to the urinal
just as he is about to relieve himself the door opens
this is an experience mitch has never before and as a result he is one uncomfortable fifteen year old
hi good morning i thought i saw you come in here you must be an earlier riser we met last night im jordan remember
i had a sled with me i made you a sweater
she holds out a sweater
he leans into the urinal trying to hide himself the best he can
yeah its just something i do with my hands while im reading
i hope i got the size right im pretty sure i did i have a brother so i use him as a sizing comparison and i have a pretty good
eye for that sort of thing so i just went ahead and made you one because i was you know up
i never sleep
i dont know why
it drove my roommate nuts
i mean really nuts they had to take her away in an ambulance and everything shes okay now thought but she had to be transfer to an easier school but
i dont know if that part has anything to do with being my fault but still anyway if you ever want any help studying at night or just let me know okay cause im just a couple of doors down from you guys and im usually up and i wouldnt mind okay
thanks i will
are you finished yet
i cant start
because im here
i think so
isnt that weird
well i have to go
right well dont forget what i said ill put the sweater in your room see you later tell chris that if he wants one ill be happy to make him
one but nit today because after classes im going to rebuild the back part of my room you should come down and see it later i have to go bye
mitch is coming down a hallway into the area
he is dressed in his tie and jacket and has books under his arm
as he crosses past the self serve vending machine he spots chris entering the kitchen
mitch follows him inside
something strange happened to me this morning
was it a dream where you see yourself dressed up in kind of sun god robes standing on top of a pyramid with all theses nude women throwing little pickles
no why am i the only person who has that dream
before mitch can ask another question chris open the freezer compartment and takes out a large thermos like container
he takes it over to the cutting board then takes from his pocket a pair of calipers a pair of tweezers and a little box that looks like a dental
he opens the container which immediately starts pouring thick steam
chris uses calipers to extract a length of tubing from inside the container
he puts it down on the board and using the tweezers pushing out a cylindrical mound of ice from inside the tube
then from the dental floss kit he pulls out a length of very fine wire which he uses to cut the ice into a number of thin coins and slides
then into the lid of the container which he picks up and takes out the door with him
using the tweezers chris picks up an ice coin and puts it into one of the machines
there is a high pitched squeak
to mitchs astonishment the machine accepts the bogus money and a cup drops down and fills with coffee
so whats happened
theres a guy living in our closet
youve seen him too
chris puts his coins in several of the machines and retrieves from them junk food junkys treasure trove of goodies
who is it
mitch stares after him
a quick series of shots moves us through the next two months of time accompanied by an original song
an older professor is lecturing pointing to a complicated algebraic problem on a blackboard mitch is in the last row of this student filled multi tiered classroom
everyone else listens intently and makes notes while mitch thumbs quickly through a textbook then closes it and makes a note in a loose leaf binder
mitch stands with a group of other students watching an instructor explain the intricacies of nuclear fission
mitch opens a notebook and starts writing furiously
mitch is using his notes and some pieces of equipment to explain something to the rest of the team
chris is impressed
kent shakes his head in disagreement until atherton nods his approval at which point kent also agrees
it is late but mitch is still hard at the books
hopsfield goes by and disappears in the closet
mitch doesnt even notice anymore
there is a knock at the door and jordan enters
she has brought mitch a device that she just built which holds textbooks and turns the pages automatically
mitch dressed more informally is in the same room with the same professor as in scene
this time however there are several empty seats
the people have been replaced by cassette tape recorders
mitch takes notes
mitch enters with another student to find a teddy bear waiting for him at his place
mitch and chris work alone
it is obviously very late
using a variety of exotic looking devices they put the laser through its paces and make notes
this time mitch is the only student
tape recorders sit in front of every seat
the professor drones on apparently oblivious to what he sees in front of him
a very attractive instructress is demonstrating a dye trace experiment in a huge wave tank
mitch takes notes
mitch and ick are carrying trays of food looking for a place to sit
they pass a seated kent who points out a place for mitch who looks to see a highchair at the end of the table
mitch comes down the stairs with several books under his arms
he stumbles and drops one of the books
as he struggles to recover it it is handed to him by none other than hopsfield
by the time mitch realizes who it is the mysterious figure is once again gone
mitch is crossing the street carrying a huge load of books
suddenly a yellow citroen pulls up behind him and honks its horn causing mitch to drop everything
he looks at the driver and sees that it is a laughing kent
chris kent bodie and carter are present as atherton wraps up a days class
people take serious notes
chris reads a magazine
people file out and mitch enters approaches chris to get him to work on the laser
chris shakes his head
mitch is working alone
he adjusts the laser and turns it on
it burns through a very thick block of wood but mitch is still not pleased
a very tired mitch heads for the lecture hall
he comes to the door opens it and enters to see a tape recorder lecturing to a roomful of tape recorders
in need of a break from studying mitch goes to the closet in hopes of figuring out how to open the wall
he examines the walls and the floor and looks for hidden switches or secret mechanisms all to no avail
as hes about to give up the closet door swings closed
when it closes the wall opens to reveal a small elevator like cage
mitch steps in and the cage descends
it hits a lever and stops
but before mitch steps in and the can get off it begins to move sideways triggering another pulley and goes down again into the steam tunnels then drags along the
floor and stops
mitch gets out
in the distance there is a glow of light
mitch goes forward until he can see the home of hopsfield
its a very utilitarian example of life on the edge with all the comforts
at the console of an amazing hand built computer sits amazing hopsfield
mitch watches in awe from the darkness
there is an experiment in progress
a large laser is building up an energy load
atherton kent bodie carter and mitch monitor various pieces of equipment
things hum and click and there is a sense that something big is going to happen
atherton seems pleased while mitch seems troubled
suddenly a valve blows and a stream of liquid nitrogen hisses from a hose spewing frost over everything
everyone jumps for switches and they shut the experiment down
checking the valve its nothing
its just mechanical
dont bother changing it
i want you and bodie to rebuild the whole unit same output in half the size
should hold up right mitch
sure as long as we go with h
well gentlemen now what
things are going okay so far arent they
they certainly are in my area jerry
warning unaware yes
boy when i think of all the applications for this
covering weve got enough theory to deal with without talking applications
you just worry about giving me that power breakthrough
how close are you
gloating not very from what i hear
to mitch arent you and chris working together
where is mr
anxious to get chris in trouble hes outside
kent goes to the window and shouts down
atherton wants you
hes sitting on a chaise lounge with a stack of encyclopedias sipping a beer
pull out to reveal that the chaise lounge has balloons tied to each corner
chris dumps a volume from his lap and the chaise rises straight up in the air
chris hovers in mid air
what are you doing out there
fuming i want to see you at my house at six oclock
should i bring anything
how about a proper attitude for a change
ill try and borrow one
now if youll excuse me there are millions of boys and girls everywhere waiting for me to bring them presents
ho ho ho
he hands atherton a volume and floats from view
atherton mitch and kent stand at the window watching chris ascend
hes really pushing it isnt he jerry
he smiles as he watches his roommate and friend float off
the restoration work is reaching completion and the house is looking pretty beautiful
a small crew of workmen paint and do other finishing work
chris is sitting on the porch watching
he is eating a very large puffs of popcorn from a bag
we see atherton returning from his daily jog
he is decked out in an expensive designer jogging suit and has all the appropriate accessories
he also has all the silly habits of the trendy runner for cooling down and stretching
you wanted to see me your joggingness
right on time
what a surprise
do you run
only when chased
what are you eating
its one of marks ickagamis experiments
hes been irradiating corn with strontium
its his hobby big food
its big popcorn
over reacting get it away from me
i cant stand it
i hate popcorn
leave it there
chris puts the bag down on the porch
have you ever considered switching to de caffeinated coffee
atherton leads chris to the front door where he removes his shoes and then stands and waits until chris does the same
they proceed into the house
the interior is immaculate
a classic example of elegant good taste
atherton is fastidiously protective of his things
i want to start seeing a lot more of you in the lab
you want me to work nude
very funny youre a major disappointment to me chris
and you to me jerry
angry we had a deal
and i advanced your project more than any three guys on campus
that was yesterday
what have you done for me today
hey arent you getting a little obsessive about this
i took in the new kid
hes working his guts out for you
your arrogant disrespectful behavior is distracting him
if you keep it up youre going to pay for it
hey im out of here
delenda est cartheo
you still have to pass dear boy and considering the fact that my class is a requisite it would seem that i would have some control over your destiny
from now on you and mr
simon are going to spend every waking moment working on my power problem and you will solve it by my deadline
okay jerry but i really think you should see an analyst
atherton watches him go
mitch is alone and trying to work on the new smaller laser
he looks tired and upset
he tinkers around for a while then goes back to his table and looks at his notes
nothing seems to make sense anymore
chris enters with a beaker in his hand
do me a favor taste this
mitch is confused
come on you wont hurt my feelings
chris rams the spoon in his mouth
well too sweet
mitch makes a face
what is it
i just found it in one of the labs
im just pulling your leg
how are you doing
atherton says weve got to miniaturize the power supply and youre not helping
its only a laser
chris goes to the laser
mitch is annoyed
instead of trying to take that roomful of capacitors over there and putting new perspective
charge this baby up
everything youve got
go mitch goes next door
chris meanwhile measures a certain distant from the floor and mounts a mirror on the wall above his head
he then moves to the laser and repositions it to shoot at the mirror
mitch returns and makes some adjustments to a control panel
all set i think
mitch throws a switch
immediately a loud electrical hum fills the air
chris goes over and opens the door to the hall and glances left
a roomful of capacitors loading
the lights twinkle from various buildings
we hear the hum the lights twinkle from various buildings
we hear the hum growing
what are you doing now
suddenly there are several loud snaps and all the lights on campus go off at once as the power overload blows the sub station fuses
relax its just the fuses at the sub station
theyll have it back on in a second
more importantly did we get a charge
suddenly there is a loud crack and the laser sends out a beam across the room bouncing off the mirror on the wall
out the door where it hits another mirror and disappears from sight
the beam has formed a web of light across the darkened campus
the effect is quite spectacular
people look in awe
chris and mitch exit the physics building
follow the yellow brick road
have you ever considered the fact that you are completely wasting your life
the lights on campus come back on as chris and mitch continue to follow the beam
an open window above the door lets the beam of light enter
chris and mitch enter
chris and mitch walk down a stairway through an open door following the beam
the place has been turned into an indoor waikiki
the beam has been directed into a hood shaped device that has split it into enough rays to cook a bunch of hot dogs and hamburgers on an improvised barbeque
managed by ick who is dressed for the beach and wearing a welding mask
past him we can see that there about twenty girls and some guys present
several of them are water skiing on the mechanically produced waves inside the tank towed by an elaborated pulleys system
others are frolicking on the beach and cut out palms stand around achieving the desired effect
blankets have been laid out and girls sit on them eating hot dogs and talking
there are sun lamps set up in one area and some kids are smoothing sun tan oil and shagging a few rays
rock music fills the room
lifts his mask aloha
a lot of the guys weve seen around the dorm have started to arrive
they enter hesitantly at chriss urging
come on in boys
awestruck shy but excited they approach
a nerdy student i have a geochemistry test tomorrow and i do not feel adequately prepared
but the main thing is you look good
what if we end up having too much fun and end up failing
and would that be the end of the world
yes it would
yeah youre right
maybe you should go back to the library
well maybe i could just look for a minute
noticing are those girls
i havent had them all tested yet cornell but so far so good
who are they
theyre not from here
no no theyre not theyre from a nearby college though
the wanda trossler school of beauty
gee i dont know
theyll teach you
lets get serious here lads
there are guys at pacific tech and girls
a ratio of
to good milton
of the girls most of them can find guys a lot better than you
these girls are not used to geniuses
you might impress them
i dont see how
let me put this another way
given the type of people you are and the environment youre in you guys have to admit the strong probability that this may be the only chance youll ever get
in your entire lives to have sex
there is a pause while everyone considers the hypothesis
think about it
he turns and heads into the party
after a beat everyone except mitch follows chriss lead
water skiing dancing a volleyball game
most of the guys are making an effort to socialize
mitch watches quietly
so what do you guys do
just be smart all the time
whats your major
is that like sports medicine
let me ask you something about that
if i was on the moon could i like tease hair much higher
this is fascinating
angle on another guy named fenton and a girl
my friend evelyn tells me that brilliant men are the best lovers
id say thats true
up to now whats been your ultimate sexual experience
i once fell off a ladder and landed on my sister bernice
angle on connell and a girl in the tank
they both bob up out of the water
cornell still has his glasses on
he takes them off and cant see
why do you wear those glasses
so i can see
but you look very sexy without them
reflexively he breaks his glasses in his hands
angle on milton and vivian
he rubbing suntan oil on her back i really should be studying
i have a bleaching final tomorrow
im allergic to suntan oil
maybe you should stop
aroused i dont think i can angle on cornell and louisa
they are sitting on the beach toweling off
very sexy you know i read in the enquirer that woman paid twenty thousand dollars for the sperm of a genius
putting her arms around him ive got twenty bucks
do you have a cup
the party is in full swing and most of the guys have become very comfortable
some are making out
mitch now seems like the only one left out
he sees a pretty girl just coming out of the water
she adjusts her top
mitch wanders over to her
with great effort hi
i was watching you
i was thinking of maybe going for a swim myself
is this the kiddy pool
she exits leaving mitch devastated
he goes and sits in a corner
meanwhile chris is looking around proudly
its obvious he didnt see what just happen to mitch
he smiles at the fun everyone is having
a girl passes him eating a hamburger
dont eat that
dont you know eating that stuff can give you very large breasts
mock despair oh
i see im too late
he puts his arms around her and they walk off
as chris and kimberly exit we catch a glimpse of a face in a window
we push in to see kent spying
open tight on athertons face
he looks odd as there are kleenex tissues sticking out from his shirt collar
a hand comes into frame holding a pancake makeup puff and starts applying it to his face
im doing the best i can
you act like i dont want my own invention to work
there are only so many hours in a day
and whats more important massaging your ego on television explaining the digestive system of a rabbit to the great unwashed or project crossbow off hand id say television
angrily to make up man just get rid of the crows feet
to carmichael carefully theres nothing more important than crossbow but when went from blue sky to black you turned into bigfoot
the stage manager approaches
ready to go dr
pushing me doesnt help
you tell them that
he walks away
there is definitely no love between them
under his breath son of a bitch
under his breath asshole
angle on atherton as he walks over to the cue card man and checks through the cards
kent enters in a rush
i have something to
cutting him off did you pick up my dry cleaning
yes i did
theres something you should know
the gravy stain
no that came out
very pleased chris and mitch arent working
theyre at a party
atherton begins to seethe
i want to show me where right after im finished here
all smiles my pleasure
kent forgets to move
atherton shoves him off
we hear an off stage crash
we push in on nearby monitor
the shows logo comes on along with its theme music
welcome to science with your host dr
a grant from pacific electric instruments
and now dr
atherton appears on the monitor
he smiles broadly and reads from the cue cards
tonight were going to look at something most of us take for granted
whats it look like
she tosses a volleyball up into the air in a one woman game of catch
mitch approaches forlornly
im not very
sure all right
through the following mitch and jordan volley the ball between them
some party huh
hesitant how come youre not
im not gay
embarrassed i didnt
i wouldnt even
look im seventeen
im brilliant and im hyper kinetic
guy are a little afraid of me you know
softly i think youre very nice
mitch gets smashed on the head with the ball sending his glasses flying
suddenly atherton burst into the room followed closely by kent
seeing mitch simon
he passes the tape deck and snaps it off
everything comes to a stop as atherton heads for mitch all eyes trained on the pending drama
you were supposed to be in the lab tonight
chiming in werent you
i was and
you are at pacific tech to work not to behave like a philistine
i was working i
i imagine this was his idea
to mitch very angry i took a big chance recommending a fifteen year old
i guess i made a mistake
i hope youre proud of yourself
kent is in seventh heaven as atherton turns and heads for the door
as they exiting they pass cornell and his date
are you wearing makeup
atherton can only stare in his rage
is it too try and hide those crows feet
he growls and exits
he is truly at a loss in the face of this cruelty
everyone is staring at him
he runs out the door
she watches mitch go feeling very badly for him mitch tired looking like a kid whos been working for hours is staring at a formula on the blackboard
frustrated he throws his screwdriver against it in anger and runs into the adjacent room and begins disconnecting the capacitor bank
kent bodie and carter cross toward the lab
just then mitch comes out
he looks exhausted and very upset
as he passes kent he turns away from his stare
mock concern gee he looks depressed
the other guys yuk it up
they turn and watch mitch go into athertons office down the hall
they follow in time to hear id like to make a collect call to mrs
kents eyes light up with an idea
mitch is on the phone
hes very upset
i know but i dont like it here anymore
i want to live at home with you
reluctant yeah and dad
i want to go back to high school
i dad did what
rented out my room
well why cant mr
echevarria and i share it
please ma i want to come home
its reels are spinning
its being held up to a telephone receiver
crying please let me come home
i dont want to stay here
widen to reveal kent holding the recorder as cater and bodie watch
the workbench area in kents lab is covered with a drop cloth
kent chuckles as mitch pleads with his mother
the dorm population is eating their breakfast
kent and his unholy two are smugly downing their shredded wheat mitch is alone off in the corner
its obvious he hasnt slept
chris enters and crosses to kent
a waitress middle aged is serving coffee
lets never fight like that again
weve been lovers too long to have a silly argument come between us
the waitress stares disgustedly at kent
you were right
tonight ill wear the cowboy suit
do your parents know about this
of course not
she nods and exits
kent calls after her
i mean theres nothing to know
chris walks over to mitch
where were you all last night
where you were supposed to be
jordan told me about atherton coming down on you
what exactly did
mitch abruptly turns his back to chris and continues eating
chris sees the conversation is over
referring to the sentence he never finished let me hold that thought and get back to ya
ken bodie and carter
the gentle strains of classical music fill the room
something soothing to eat by
the tape is abruptly interrupted by the recording kent made of mitch on the phone to his mother
he cant believe his ears
his expression runs from surprise to embarrassment
everyone stops eating and listens to mitch begging his mother to come home
they share his embarrassment and lower their heads
even kents friends are uncomfortable
kent on the other hand is laughing it up having a great time
hes in a state of shock
he cant wait here comes the crying
he loves it
he runs out of the dinning room
kent loves mitch reaction
it makes him laugh harder
to himself too low
mitch is trying to pack but its difficult because the place is in such disarray
he watches and tries to think of what to say
okay if you want to leave go ahead
but youll miss the fun
sour what fun
ick invented a new virus and were gonna release it in kents room
mitch turns on chris with surprising hostility
thats a sick thing to do
hey i was just kidding i
youre always just kidding
theres something wrong with you
just a second
the other night i needed your help and all you wanted to do was party
i tried to help you
i tried to help you relax
being snubbed by beauticians isnt my idea of relaxing
blows up i thought this place was going to be different but its just the same
im either used or made fun of
in high school they pushed me in a mailbox did i tell you that
they called me chris the whiss
whats a whiss
i think they meant wuss but it didnt rhyme
when i was three years old i balanced my fathers checkbook so they sent me to school and fired their accountant
my father was so intimidated he stopped speaking to me
my teacher disliked me because i was smarter than they were and my classmates hated me because i bell the bell curve
and tell me why my
why did my mother dress me in white shirts hush puppies and a briefcase guaranteeing that a girl would never talk to me
mitch looks down at his own white shirt and hush puppies
dramatic and then one night in this room i was sitting right where you are sitting now
i had a vision
i saw him
the guy in the closet
i followed him
through the closet down into the steam tunnels
and down there i saw the most disgusting thing ive ever seen
hopsfield in his pajamas
lighter but sincere and i talk to the guy
turned out that in the seventies he was the number one stud around here
smarter than you and me put together
so brilliant so sharp so advanced so long
what do you mean
went to work for some chemical company
one day someone told him he was making stuff that was killing people
i think it was his mother
you see he was totally unprepared for the real world
he had no philosophy
he thought science was the answer for everything
mitch am i gonna wind up in a steam tunnel
yes you are metaphorically speaking
unless you see that the same thing that has made your life miserable can make it great your brain
when youre smart people need you and you can learn how to work that for fun and profit
you had a arrangement going with atherton dont you
thats why you dont have to study
hey i dont carry a briefcase
pause youre a nice kid
if you leave ill miss you
thinking about it if i stay what should i do i mean
well the first thing you have to do is get even with kent
its a moral imperative
kents citroen pulls up
kent and carter get out and walk by jordan who is sitting nearby
and at northern electronics you get the stock options but not the free housing its what makes pei so sweet
you get everything
yeah and kinsleys got that locked
knowingly maybe he does and maybe he doesnt
they walk away
after a beat chris mitch and ick jump out from behind another car
mitch carries a tool box
the others rush over to her
chris trains a light on the license plate
it reads kent
he puts his name on his car
he does the same thing with his underwear
mitch flops down the tool box
chris mitch jordan and ick working on kents car
they are undoing bolts talking out wires removing fenders etc
the last dissolve and we see the car is gone
and no sign of our foursome
chris quietly goes up the stairs inside the dorm carrying a steering wheel
ick and mitch have an engine on a flatbed cart
jordan enters carrying heavy chains and a drill
filthy with crankcase oil chris mitch ick and jordan exit and scamper down the hall
all are very pleased with themselves
kent is coming down the hall
he opens his door and walks inside
closeup on kent
his jaw drops open
chris and mitch enter
thats your car
youre not supposed to park on campus
this isnt funny
you went too far this time kinsley
i had help
surprised to mitch you
a beat im going to get you guys
athertons gonna hear about this
he storms out of his room
calls to kent hey kent you owe us ten dollars for the gas
to mitch hell never pay us
the restoration has been completed and the house looks beautiful
chris comes up the walk goes to the door and rings the bell
a very pretty girl named susan answers the door
jerry asked me to drop by
what did he ask you to do
which word didnt you understand
are you here for the meeting
i dont know
im just waiting
the study doors open and atherton carmichael and decker step out
finishing their conversation and finally it comes down to if you cant do it well get somebody else
i have a timetable doctor
were very close dave dont worry everythings going to be fine
cold as ice don try and remember you work for me
to atherton i think ive made my point havent i
equally as cold crystal clear mr
anything i should know about
shut up kinsley
ill be with you in a moment
goodbye jerry and good luck
they begin to exit
chris takes susans hand
i guess this is goodbye
im sorry i didnt get a chance to know you
to the boys in admiration have you ever seen breasts like theses before
she happens to be my daughter
oh then i guess you have
to atherton ill be reporting to him every day
what do you think youre doing
you said come over
take off those shoes
chris removes his shoes to reveal even dirtier socks
stay off the rugs
whats up doc
im withdrawing your recommendation to pei
im giving kent the job
did you suddenly find humor
you havent solved my power problem
no youre not
so im going to fail you so you wont graduate so you cant take the job
ill pass your exam
atherton just smiles a so what smile
we had a deal
that doesnt sound very ethical
you cant do this
ill go to dr
enjoying this go ahead
what are you going to tell him
dont forget like most scientists he is an honorable moral man who thinks everyone else is too
ill just deny anything you say
count on it
chris sits lost in thought outside the window of his room mitch appears at the window sees chris and climbs out to join him
what are you doing
i was thinking of jumping but its only twelve feet
atherton is going to flunk me out of school
but you had a deal
yeah and he says i didnt deliver
you sleep with pits you wake up smelly
i think aristotle said that
it was him or eva gabor
at least hopsfield still has his integrity
i thought i was so smart
i didnt want to be like the other dumb geniuses like hopsfield
i though i could use them
instead of them using me
but guess what
i have to agree
it does appear that youve been the victim of your own erroneous logic
however this doesnt mean that you cant get yourself out
but thats the old way
a series of shots showing chris hard at work underscored by an original song
mitch and chris dismantle part of the laser
mitch jordan and ick are listening as chris shows them diagrams and formulas for a laser supercharger while they try to eat
chris and ick search for a new gas combination for the laser supercharger
mitch and chris work hard on a second laser
kent is both upset and suspicious of chris new interest in work
chris enters carrying books and a note pad
kent sees this and is shocked
atherton gives chris a you havent got a chance grin
they both study for exams on the wall is a chart of exam week showing mitchs exam schedule a big red square around chris exam with atherton and in every
free hour is written laser
many students including our gang study for exams
suddenly milton cant take the pressure any longer and momentarily goes out of his mind and runs from the room
a tired looking chris and mitch attach a second laser to the original but nothing improves
they check their notes and diagrams
kent bodie and carter chuckle in the corner
mitch is taking an exam with a bunch of people he doesnt recognize from the professor who everyone tape recorded
one of the students appears to be near panic as he deals with a pile of mangled tape
chris and jordan use a blackboard diagram to discuss the engineering difficulties of chris laser supercharger assembly
chris runs down the hall and enters his room
mitch is sprawled out asleep under a math text
chris feels bad about it but wakes him up
a wasted chris and mitch build the new assembly that will allow a second laser to shoot at the gas jets of the principal laser
chris is studying hard
mitch is asleep his head on the table
in his sleep please vito not in the mailbox again
mitch wakes up
i was just reliving some high school highlights
look you dont have to stay up with me
its not like were driving
get some sleep
youre a growing boy
hopsfield enters carrying two large boxes of what appear to be file cards
mitch is stunned
they all stare for a beat
i thought you might want some help so i dug into the computer and got every question arthertons ever asked on every final he ever given
gee i didnt get you anything
is that them
no these are entries for mcdonalds sweepstakes
no purchase necessary
enter as often as you want
so i am
this box makes it one million six hundred thousand
i should win thirty two point six percent of the prizes including the car
kind of takes the fun out of it doesnt it
i suppose so
but they set up the rules and lately i have come to realize that i have certain materialistic needs
so where are the questions
insulted i memorized them
chris and mitch look at each other impressed and a little frightened
i have to go to sleep now
want my pajamas
hes going to grow five inches in the next year
how do you
he opens the door and enters
he turns on the light
much to his surprise and ours seated on his bed is sherry nugil the girl chris met at pei the genius groupie
shes dressed for the occasion
im sherry nugil
and ive been waiting three years for this
for you to be old enough
she kisses him
are you ready
why do you keep saying for what
cause so far its working great
jordan is using a big machine to sand her floors
theres a knock on the door
shouts come in
mitch enters he appears dazed and disheveled
oh hi mitch
im just sanding the floor
could you turn that off a second
she starts moving the furniture back
why are you sweating
i came back from helping chris and there was this woman in my room
jordan stops its the first time weve seen her doing nothing
with emphasis a woman
i mean she was
and she wanted to
how can i say this so as not to offend you
i hope youre not offended
so what happened
excited she kissed me
then she took off her clothes
then i took off my clothes she had to help me
i kept blacking out then
it was unbelievable
you made it with her
thats what was unbelievable
i stopped her and told her i didnt want to
i mean i really did want to
but not with her
he looks at her hopefully
chris puts the finishing touches on the second laser assembly
he seems pretty pleased with himself
kent bodie and carter watch conspiratorially
carter looks at his watch and starts for the door
lets go girls whats that supposed to mean
its just a f
figure of speech bodie
you guys coming to the exam or not
finishing his work i guess we should seeing as hes gone to all the bother of having one and everything
they all begin to exit but then kent holds up
you guys go ahead
i have to go to the bathroom
exiting okay kent but i dont think thats going to help your confidence do you
the others exit as kent goes back to chris laser opens it up and starts to fiddle with the works
to himself so mr
funny man lets see how funny you think this is
students wait to begin taking their final exams
chris bodie and carter enter and take their seats
atherton is passing out the booklets
you will have exactly three hours
and remember we believe in the honor system here people
he enters and heads for his seat beside chris
good luck buddy boy
is it okay if i name my first child after you
dipshit kinsley has a nice ring to it
the students are busy taking the test
he seems to be breezing through it
hes taking the test
he looks up and is distressed at chris apparent lack of trouble
chris looks over and throws kent a big kiss
kent turns away immediately
atherton is going over some plans
reprimanding this is my class hour
loud whisper were past the deadline
dont you understand deckers dangerous
we need those plans
snaps back its not ready yet
but it will be
ive got kinsley cooking now
hell do it
believe me i know how to push that kids buttons
rolling up the plans here are my drawings for the optics in the sighting system
cutting him off decker wants the laser by the end of the week
close to losing it im doing all i can damnit
atherton storms out
atherton enters like a dark cloud
he sits at his desk
he finishes his last question
he gets out of his seat
sitting at his desk
chris places his test on the desk
atherton looks up
chris has a big grin on his face
he takes a piece of paper and writes on it and then slides it in front of atherton
the piece of paper
it says i aced this
he writes a message and slides it to chris
a piece of paper which reads ace the laser
chris places an apple on athertons desk
atherton tosses the apple in the wastebasket
the apple explodes
chris is heading for the lab
the place has that look of exam period desertion
muttering to himself okie dokie doc a house doesnt have to fall on ole chris kinsley
chris enters and prepares to test the new equipment
he aligns the secondary laser and let it charge up
he makes some final checks and then throws a switch
the laser fires for an instant but then seems to go crazy
the new laser overheats and the main chamber sparks and smokes
chris tries to shut it down but to now avail
he tears the cover off in hopes of pulling the wiring but hes too late
we see everything melting away as the machine eats itself
we also see a message left for chris just before it too melts
it reads laser car
chris is on the verge of a complete mental collapse as he watches his work go up in smoke
in anguish no
there is nothing but the echo of his voice in response
the main laser stands like a huge frozen bird in the empty room
in anger and frustration he swears at the machine
this is your fault
he kicks the wastepaper basket in hopes of getting rid of some of this anger but instead all he gets is the basket bouncing back and hitting him in the
i deserve that
it all comes back on you in the end
he suddenly stands up straight as though he were having a stroke
inspiration takes hold and chris begins running around like a madman gathering up parts to the laser
almost singing hes so happy of course its so simple
echoes bouncing back at me and you
chris runs up the stairs three at a time
he bursts in
the room is empty
the closet door opens and hopsfield steps out carrying another box of cards
have you seen mitch
how did you do
elated i failed
you shouldnt have
but never mind that now
it came to me
the power problem
i solved it
its so simple four little mirrors
it bounces back and supercharges the gas itself
ive got to find mitch to help me build it but it should increase the power ten fold at least
if you see him tell him to meet me at the lab
chris exits leaving hopsfield lost in thought
a hand painted sign hangs over the door that says exam week decompression here
chris runs in the door
the room is full of students who are blowing off steam from studying for and taking exams
they are engaged in all sorts of silly mindless activities ranging from tiddly winks and video games to watching cartoons
there are supplies of brain food and health drinks around
mitch ick and jordan are in the corner
chris runs up to them
how did it go
it was a snap
but atherton said hes failing me anyway
you must be feeling awful
are you all right
thank you jordan
i do feel terrible but i cant talk about it right now
i need mitch
he grabs mitch and pulls him out
he seems to be handling it all right
chris knocks on the front door
atherton answers the door
he is less than thrilled to see chris
forcing his way in hiya jerry hows it going
what do you want kinsley
world peace but i dont think this is the time to discuss it
what are you doing here
ive already told you youve burned out and youve failed me and yourself miserably
yes i know that
but i thought you might be interested
im not interested in anything you have to say
just then a pretty coed starts to come down the stairs
she is dressed only in one of athertons shirts
i solved the power problem jerry
he looks at chris then the girl
debbie go home
atherton kent bodie and carter stand by the laser as chris explains what hes done with formulas on the blackboard
as you know i was working on supercharging the df by means of a fusion technique using a secondary laser
well when i tried it i discovered kent had sabotaged it so it collapsed on itself
everyone looks at kent in disgust
and i want to thank him for the thought
the deuterium and fluorine take up enough space by themselves right
well the mistake weve been making up to now is in trying to kick up the power by means of yet another outside source
big and bulky right
well the elegance of this is that by reflecting part of the lasing light back in the gas jets we supercharge the whole deal increasing the power tenfold with no
increase in size
this is a complete waste of time
mitch has been preparing the laser for demonstration
he is struggling to lift several thick metal plates
kent make yourself useful for once and help put those plates against the wall
kent does and everyone stands back
okay mitch do it
this should work
mitch switches on the main laser
it comes to life
gases flow and a beam appears hitting the plate without effect
now we open the vacuum chamber
he turns a valve and the beam begins to heat up the plate
so far so good
and now cross your fingers
he throws a switch
theres a beat
and then suddenly the beam glows intensely brighter cuts through the plate the cabinets behind it and through the wall out into the night
chris and mitch jump shut the whole thing off
sorry about the wall sir
looking through the hole and the tree across the quad
in awe screw the wall you did it
you really did it
petulant ive done my part too
ignoring kent okay kinsley
you did it
thank you sir
and i think we can get that job back for you at pei
thats my job
ive done everything youve ever asked
i get your laundry and i finished the mirror
kent runs out of the room as mitch and chris exchange a look and atherton shakes his head
kent returns rolling a circular precision mirror one meter in diameter
do you have any idea how hard it is to make a film virtually per cent reflective one micron thick and apply it to a mirror this shape
to chris in a hurry i have to go
i have a pressing
very happy for chris lets celebrate
kent you with us
totally frustrated oh
chris mitch ick and jordan are looking at the laser hole in the tree
they look at where the beam has cut a hole through the head of the statue of dr
they look high up at a hole where the beam went through a telephone pole and then across the street even higher where it burned through a billboard on top
our group is celebrating
the jukebox blares
chris and ick are drinking beers mitch and jordan are holding hands sharing a milkshake and feeding each other french fries
i dont think im ready for that yet
maybe we should wait a year at least until i get my license
there are a lot of things to be considered here
for example i could drive
hopsfield enters and sits down at the table
everyone stares for a beat
to chris ive been thinking about your laser solution
a beat i figure youve increased the output to six megawatts
what would you use that for
the applications are unlimited
industrial for one
with the gas tanks youve designed the beam would only last for forty seconds
what good is that
i dont care laslo
let the engineers figure out a use for it
thats not our concern
maybe somebody already has a use for it one for which its perfectly designed
you mean atherton had something in mind all along
looks at the facts very high power portable limited firing time unlimited range
all youd need is a big spinning mirror and you could vaporize a human target from space
hopsfield gets up and walks outside
silence for a beat
this is not good
you want another beer
how big a mirror
chris mitch ick jordan and hopsfield run down the hall and enter the lab
the laser is gone
chris runs next door and forces kents lab door open looks in
they all enter
the mirror is gone too
atherton you worm
kent you too
chris is venting his rage on every inanimate object in the room kicking and punching
i should have seen it
how could i have not seen it
he lied to us
its easy to lie to you
you trust people
what an asshole i am
i understand how you feel chris and youre right
but what we should be doing now is trying to find out what hes doing
chris and mitch sit waiting
chris is very despondent
did you do it
i put a receiver in it too
referring to chris is he okay
i dont know he stopped talking about an hour ago
may i see it
she holds out her hand and we see an almost microscopic electronic device
ick enters carrying several gas masks a gas bottle some tubing an atomizer
mitch jordan and ick are gathered around the closed door to kents room wearing the gas masks
ick feeds the end of the tube under the door and opens the valve on the bottle
well have two minutes
a student walks by not batting an eye
the gas has knocked kent out
he sleeps peacefully in a chair
the door opens and our gang enters
to mitch open his mouth
he does and she pulls out some dental tools and goes to work placing the receiver in kents mouth
jordan contd it was his braces that gave me the idea
theyre a perfect antenna
its about time someone put it to good use
they all huddle around a homemade radio transceiver
disguising his voice into a microphone kent
wake up kent
kent begins to stir
we can hear mitchs voice coming from kents head
at first he thinks hes dreaming
im talking to you kent
i said im talking to you
shaking his head violently no
slapping himself im not asleep
i must be overworked
youre not overworked kent
well im not insane
that remains to be seen kent
but we are having a conversation
i have to metabolize this
who is this
this is jesus kent and youve been a very naughty boy
cracking up laughing all right
who is this
i am known by many names
i am the one
turn to me and be saved
cut the crap kent youve built a weapon
how did you know that
i know everything
thats right kent
where is the laser now
i cant tell you
how would you like to burn for the rest of time
panicking no theyre testing it on the twenty seventh but i dont know where
i want you to think about what youve done and repent and from now on stop playing with yourself
okay now what
the closets door opens and hopsfield appears
they are near hopsfields lair
hopsfield has removed the cover from an enormous terminal
chris seems remote and depressed
this is the phone terminal for the entire school
okay we tap athertons office phone
what about his home
all the facultys home phone are part of the university system
enthusiastically looking at the maze of wiring great all we have to do is find it
well find it
jordan and hopsfield set to work searching for athertons lines
ick is concerned about chris
why did i listen to my parents
i should have become a ping pong pro
its not too late
you shouldnt be depressed
its us he used
still working ernie downtown schmidlap
from my high school
he was captain of everything
one day he told me he wanted to date me up
so for a month hed come over and id do his homework for him
he was going to take me to the prom
but once he passed his courses he took roberta preen
i stayed home and re wired our housekeepers tv
you think that hurts
you shouldve met my uncle stan
he was a weasel
that bad huh
no that was his lodge
the royal order of friendly weasels
every wednesday when i was eight hed take me down to his lodge meeting and hed challenge people to call out two five digit numbers
i had to multiply them in my head faster than a guy could do it on a calculator
theyd bet on me
of course after the meeting hed take me for ice cream
hed take me to the supermarket and i had to dip my hand in
ive got his office
ive got his home
theyve all made themselves comfortable as they sit and wait for the phone tap to produce results
hopsfield has wired a speaker so that they can hear why doesnt your phone ring you jogging syphilitic microbe
sotto to mitch i think hes coming around
suddenly from the speaker we hear the sound of athertons phone being picked up
hello is this jerome atherton
yes it is
this is bill carlisle
i saw your television show the other night about the reproductive system
thank you i hope you enjoyed it
i love it
everything you said was copied word for word from my book and i expect a lot of money for it
need i remind you its public television an attempt to teach people something
and all you can think of is personal greed
its people like you that make me feel bad about being american
im canadian im not surprised
they hang up
god hes good at that
he almost gets away with it
thats the most manipulative guy ive ever seen
i mean heard
he does get away with it
everyone lies asleep in various places and positions mitch awakens
he is amazed to find jordan asleep on his shoulder so amazed he has to wake her
you were sleeping
gee snuggling i guess you relax me
awakening whats going on
i put jordan to sleep
and youre proud of that
the speaker comes to life with the sound of the receiver being groped for and then athertons groggy voice
dave decker how are you
christ dave what time is it
nine thirty here in washington
i thought you californians all get up early and exercise
ha ha this is it
thats the guy i saw at his house with the daughter
very funny dave
what do you want
it sounds like it
listen ill be out there tomorrow for the test but i want you to go to the marsh this afternoon and check optics systems one more time
because im in charge doctor
he hangs up
all look to chris
comes to life its happening
its only weapon if it works right
determined youre absolutely right
the time has come people
no more being used
no more downtown schmidlaps or uncle stans or jerry athertons
were going to take responsibility for our own brains
remember without ethics there can be no morality
without morality there is no society and without society there can be no fast food restaurants
so the whole country nay in the world is counting on us to get even in a big way
its just something you say at a time like this
i dont need a watch
okay forget it
atherton comes out and heads for his car carrying an over night bag
as he drives away we see that ick has been spying on him
ick is hiding behind some bushes on a knoll
he is looking through binoculars
athertons car is passing through a high security gate into marsh field
chris mitch and hopsfield are loading the last of several large boxes into a beat up van
the van pulls up in front
painted on the side is a plumbers logo
mitch jordan and ick start unloading boxes
chris goes to the front door
chris picks the lock
chris and mitch enter to see hopsfield as he works at the computer attempting to interface with another computer
each time he hits the keys the readout replies negative
boy these secret fields are so untrusting
so we cant get on base clearance
i guess not
well balls it
jordan enters carrying two i
how do these look
two fake i
s with mitchs and chriss picture on them
what if they dont fool anybody
they shoot us
technicians check monitors and prepare for the coming test
nearby stands a firing command module very reminiscent of the pilots compartment in the opening sequence
atherton goes over last minute details with various people
he seems distracted as an engineer discusses a problem with him
are you all right
oh yes fine
have you ever had a feeling that theres something terribly wrong
there are two air force police guards in the shack
chris and mitch pulls up in kents citroen behind a government sedan awaiting clearance at the gate
they are dressed as technicians and mitch sports a moustache
mitch is a wreck and chris doesnt help
he begins humming the theme from mission impossible
all clear mr
just follow the yellow line
chris accidentally hits the horn
through the windshield we see decker and the guard look back
chris recognizes decker
covering how long does it take
deckers car pulls away
the guard uses one finger to motion chris forward
chris pulls the car up
the guard leans in the window
mitch obviously shaking hands his to chris who hands them to both guard
snap it up will ya
we just flew in
we have this stupid car
the guard turns away and walks into the shack
are you out of your mind
you have to intimidate these guys
the guard returns
youre not on the list
of course not
we hear the phone ring
the second guard answers it
an air force officer is on the phone
an impatient atherton stands beside him
i dont know what he should look for just tell him if he sees anything out of the
let me tell him
he grabs the phone
arent you guys a little young to be technicians
lasers are a young science
there fine now youve made me say it
now were all in trouble
mitch looks like hes going to die
look ill call the duty officer
he starts towards the phone shack
the other guard is still on the phone
his demeanor changing excuse me
the guard turns back
look pal dont call anybody
were four hours late
its our jobs
give us a break will ya
someday you might be in the private sector right
chris gives the guard a goofy grin
the guard waves them through
the car pulls away
the guard returns to the booth
were supposed to look for anything out of the ordinary
a b bomber painted black sits in the glow of the work lights
technicians who are wearing jumpsuits similar to the ones mitch and chris have on are busy working around the plane
chris and mitch enter frame and walk up to the plane
a couple of the technicians watch them curiously as they go up the stairs into the bomb bay
chris and mitch enter
three technicians are inside the plane running last minute checks on the laser which sits in the middle of the cabin
chris crosses to the technician who is in the middle of the cabin
he watches him making mental notes as he checks the program
the technician turns sensing his presence
keep it up
mitch meanwhile checks out the laser optics
after a beat one of the technicians signals for the others to complete their jobs and exit
they start to file out
one of them turns and looks at chris who is just standing there
the technician shakes his head uncertainly and exits with the others
finally mitch and chris are alone
chris opens the briefcase
it contains a cellular phone a modem and an eeprom processor
the computer receives a signal
hopsfield turns to jordan and ick
weve got a connection
get the eeproms
mitch opens up the computer and clips a couple of power lines and pulls out four computer chips and hands them to chris who plugs them into the processor
chris picks up the phone
into phone abbott to costello
jordan picks up the phone
into phone this is costello
go ahead abbott
into phone costello whos on first
mitch hits him impatiently
weve got the goodies
we have the target coordinates computed for trajectory adjustment
hopsfields computer screen fills with machine code of ones and zeros
he begins searching through many screens of code
chris and mitch freeze as a mechanic walks by the open bomb bay door
technicians are checking monitors and a radar scope at a control panel
atherton is in the rear of the room briefing a group of civilians and military brass
amongst them is decker
atherton points to a drawing on a large chart
the plane will reach an altitude of sixty five thousand feet
when it is over the target will fire the laser from here
points to the firing module for five point two seconds
theyre all set for the final onboard check
right this way gentlemen
they all follow atherton and decker to the exit at the rear of the room
chris and mitch sweat it out
hopsfield is scanning the screens
i think ive found it
may i have the coordinates please
reading from paper thirty four degrees ten minutes fifteen seconds north one hundred eighteen degrees nine minutes three seconds west
hopsfield enters the data into his computer
into phone were sending
into phone were taking
mitch suddenly panics as he looks out
atherton and his group come around the corner of a building and head for the plane
theyre coming this way
into phone overly calm you may be interested in knowing that mitch reports that herr professor is approaching and im not even sweating
isnt that remarkable
typing furiously please i dont work well under pressure
hopsfield contd there
i hope that does it
into phone okay chris
i mean abbott
atherton and his group approach and enter the bomb bay
as they enter there is no sign of chris and mitch
atherton checks out the laser and the computer
the others examine various gauges and switches and the flight deck
everything all right
as the group exits the plane chris and mitch drop out of the forward landing gear well in the background
turning back oh i forgot
a glimpse of chris and mitch as they disappear around the corner of the building
uncertain of what he has just seen
what is it
kent looks the worse for wear as he sits surrounded by psychology books dealing with schizophrenia
surprised oh i thought you were gone
have you been touching yourself
i mean no
into mike good kent
dad my father you know god wants to show you something
i mean what
ive learned not to ask
he wants you to wait on the sidewalk at six thirty nine ivy crest drive at precisely six oh eight this morning
just wait there and you shall receive a sign
do not despair and do not go inside
a student walks in and looks at him strangely
atherton and company watch the bank of monitors as the flight controller clears the bomber for take off
chris and mitch jump into the van and drive off
some monitors show the bomber climbing while others show the desert target area
it is a mock up of a presidential motorcade
the open cars are filled with test dummies and are linked together and are being towed slowly across the desert by a tractor
into mike crossbow one radar contact
climb and maintain flight level six five oh
the van pulls up and parks across the street
chris and mitch get out
just then a volvo pulls up and jordan ick and dr
meredith get out
meredith is wearing a bathrobe pajamas and slippers
why am i not surprised to see you here
perhaps you have the explanation for this so called event im suppose to witness
yes sir i do but first may i take this opportunity to compliment you on your fashion sense
into mike crossbow one turn left to two eight zero
two eight zero roger
a technician hits a switch and a monitor pops on
crosshairs dominate the center of the screen
the desert floor rushes by
atherton turns to a specialist standing by
norman if youd be so kind
this cockpit mock up duplicates the shuttle flight deck and weve placed it here to demonstrate the firing technique
the specialist takes his place inside the command module
we are thirty one dme from the target
mike roger crossbow
open the doors
the doors open to reveal clouds rushing past and the ground far below
these are rather strong accusations chris
yes sir i know
if theyre true im going to need some proof
i think were going to be able to accommodate you in just a minute sir
looking past meredith chris sees kent approaching
angle on kent as he arrives at the house and stars up at it
he glances at his watch and waits impatiently
inside the firing module the specialist pulls down the target sighting device and puts his hands on the joysticks
t minus fifty and counting
the large mirror lowers into its firing position and the laser powers up
the group watch kent who is nervously pacing back and forth talking to himself
to mitch boy if this works hes going to start a new religion
if it doesnt work
chris shoots him a censoring look
this countdown continues
monitors display the target sight the pilots sighting screen of the ground and a cameras view of the bomber
trajectory command relay locked
now norm here has firing control
the target motorcade is sighted
the laser mirror and sighting lens move in unison as they line up on target
the crosshairs line up on the sighting monitor
whats he doing
kent has now started toward the front door
i told him not to go in
muttering to jesus look this is jerrys house were very close so if youre not going to answer me then im going in
he reaches for the front door
here i come
who turns and sees them
everyone is riveted to the sighting monitor
in ten nine eight
as the countdown continues
the computer comes to life and electronically unlocks the laser optics from the sighting camera
the mirror turns to the left
the aerial view of the motorcade remains centered on the sighting monitor
kent opens the front door and enters
to himself that looked like dr
meredith in a bathrobe
first im hearing things now im seeing things
he closes the door
let me have it
the room is dark lit only by morning light coming through a large stained glass window at the top of the stairs
in the middle of the room is what looks like a large above ground swimming pool covered in aluminum foil
kent is amazed
three two one bingo
he hits the trigger
the laser fires
the laser beam traces through the atmosphere
the group waits expectantly
nothing happens to the target
chris and mitch who are running toward the house are stopped in their tracks by the incredible sight of the red laser beam shooting down out of the heavens striking
the grass tracking across the lawn then up the wall of athertons house
the beam strikes the window and for one tiny moment causes the most incredible light show anyone has ever seen
in awe oh
the window is obliterated by the laser light which crashes down directly onto the aluminum foil covered pool
the foil is heated instantly in the laser light and there is the sound of tiny explosions building to a roar
in a second the foil rises violently and tears open
kent picks up a piece of debris and examines it
in the next instant he is engulfed in popcorn
the beam disappears as suddenly as it came
everyone stands in awe
a few kernels fly out of the broken window then a storm
kent and furniture are being forced up the stairs by a rising tide of popping popcorn
he struggles against it loses and sinks into the mound like a dinosaur in quicksand
the windows are filling up with popcorn
finally they crack and break as popcorn forces its way out of the house wherever it can
chris and mitch head for the front door
suddenly it bursts open and kent is carried out by a moving wall of popcorn
people furiously check systems
i dont understand
did it fire
yes we indicate a shot
weve got another problem though
its not shutting down
the computer is still working
the laser optics and equipment begin to melt
its been wired to self destruct
the devastated group watches the laser self destruct on the monitor
nice going jer
somethings wrong here
unlock the birds eye
he takes over the command module sighting system im tracing where the shot went
we watch as the monitors view swings away and across a residential neighborhood coming to rest on a birds eye view of his own house
the monitor view moves in to reveal what looks like a growing mushroom
what have you done
the group looks on as the mountain of popcorn continues to engulf the house
meredith goes to see if kent is all right
to mitch do you think we used too much
maybe a little
well i guess we all learned something here today
i dont know but it seemed like the right thing to say didnt it
it did to me
as they continue to watch the destruction of the house and various neighbors come out to see whats what a winnebago pulls up and stops
hopsfield gets out
i think you used too much
im sorry you missed it
yeah well i had to pack
im getting married
looking at the u haul what is all this
oh i won
only thirty one point eight percent though
i have to figure that out
but not this summer
mitch suddenly sees sherry standing at the winnebago door
kissing hopsfield hi
isnt it wonderful
i finally found him
ive been looking for him for ten years
what can i do
she loves me
anyway we probably wont ever get to see you again so bye
what do you mean
where are you going
ive got a little survival place in wyoming
were going to live there
yeah its getting too weird around here
they climb into the winnebago and it pulls away
the others watch it go
you think its getting too weird around here
i didnt notice
i like it
in the background the popcorn has split the walls of the house and finally lifts the roof off like the top of a pot
the whole house tilts to its side and the popping stops
as we pull back athertons car pulls up and he gets out dumbstruck
meredith walks over to him and confronts him
kent joins chris and the others who watch
