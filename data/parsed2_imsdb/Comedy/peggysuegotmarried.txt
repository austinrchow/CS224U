peggy tries to laugh off her embarrassment

view on rosalie in her wheelchair

the members of the committee have given this a lot of thought and decided on the two people who best represent the spirit of buchanan highs class of
the king is someone who in more ways than one has come a long long way since he left here
they all look to richard knowing hes the obvious choice
were proud to welcome him back richard norvik

the band plays a fanfare and drum roll
richard gets up and walks to the stage as everyone applauds

laughs arthur places the gold cardboard crown on richards head as they shake hands
sharon and i thank you all for making us feel so welcome
its good to be back
more applause as richard steps back
every king deserves a queen
now we had a lot at worthwhile candidates
and i dont want any of you ladies to feel left out cause youre all beautiful
but when we sent out the invitations we didnt mention anything about this being a costume party
peggys embarrassed reaction realizing everyones looking at her
maybe we should have cause just looking at her brings it all back for us
ladies and gentlemen i give you our queen peggy sue kelcher bodell

the band begins the song peggy sue
peggy looks pained

peggy sits up slowly dazed and frightened

several have tubes in their arms
nurses attend to them
carol sits up drinking a cup of juice waving weakly at peggy
maddy now a brunette slowly rolls down her sleeve
arthur dolores walter and several others from the reunion
everyone is younger but instantly recognizable

mechanically peggy hands over the twinkie
charlie bends over to nuzzle her neck
the nurses hand comes into frame and grabs charlie by the scruff of the neck pulling him up
young man stop that
the school bell rings
i just made a deposit in your blood bank
now i want to make a withdrawal
i think its time for your next class im changing banks
charlie walks away towards walter and arthur
peggy gazes after him his body blocking her view of a portion of a banner hung on the wall
it reads support the buchanan high blood drive
as charlie exits the final words come into view spring
she begins to tremble
lie back down and take a deep breath
whats going on
where am i
you passed out for a moment
nothing to worry about
how did i get here
maddy and carol approach carrying their books
why dont you let your friends help you
to maddy and carol take her into the washroom and splash some cold water on her face
that should perk her up
yes ma am
they help peggy up and lead her across the gym
the girls enter
carol immediately lights up a cigarette
peggy crosses to the mirror
to peggy wanna smoke
thats the worst thing for her
i gave them up years ago
maddy and carol react as peggy takes a closer look at herself and the girls reflections
she places a hand to her throat noticing the locket is gone
where is it

maddy what did you do to your hair
maddy looks in the mirror
maddy and carol are waiting
peggy exits the office clutching a note which she hands blankly to maddy
they walk towards the exit peggy glued to the wall for support

the girls walk outside
peggy looks around at the old cars i the parking lot
the most noticeable a blue chevrolet impala convertible
peggy stares at it for a beat shivering with recognition as she follows carol and maddy to a ford
maddy helps peggy into the back seat
carol drives and chats with maddy while in the back seat peggy looks out at the world as it she were on a ride at disneyland
she says things like thats not here anymore
the car pulls up to the curb
peggy gets out of the car
maddy hands her the note and her books she twirls her finger next to her head

peggy walks up to the door a sleepwalker in suspended animation
she waits a beat and knocks softly
who is it
shuddering peggy sue
come on in
peggy slowly opens the door
peggy enters and looks down the hallway into the kitchen
evelyn kelcher is a lovely woman in her midforties
she turns around from the sink and approaches peggy
the nurse called and said youd be coming home
peggy stares blankly at her for a beat then holds up the note as she moves towards her mother
i have a note

peggy embraces her mother holding on for dear life inhaling her scent
chanel number five
that always reminds me of home

peggy enters warily looking around a fifties museum of teenage artifacts
she walks around the room gently touching her old belongings including the record player from opening scene
she looks in the mirror to make sure shes still there
suddenly she turns around
okay im alone now

she opens the closet door expectantly then closes it shaking her head
this is crazy

peggy emerges from the bathroom wearing a towel
at a full length mirror she drops the towel and happily appraises her eighteen year old body

peggy bounces her hair in her adult natural look
good mornings all around

goodbyes all around
we hear a horn honking outside a fivenote musical phrase bebopalubop
how am i going to handle him
whats the matter
did you two have a fight
the house payments
peggy exits the house wincing at the sight of charlies car the blue impala shed seen the day before
charlie sits one arm on the wheel the other over the back of the seat
how do you feel
peggy hesitates unsure how to handle her accumulated ambivalence towards charlie
i can take care of that
peggy warily gets in
charlie leans over to kiss her but she pushes him away

charlie starts the car burns rubber and peels out
you drive like a maniac

about what we said on tuesday
it makes a lot of sense
refresh my memory
how could you forget
we talk about seeing other people and you forget
maybe i blocked it out
i can understand that
but please dont start crying again
charlies car pulls up
its not going to be forever
i figure three years is long enough
i can see it the music pans out
more tentative and right after graduation we should start seeing other people
kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married
know what i mean
surprised well we got the prom coming up all these parties
we shouldnt upset our parents
theyll learn to live with it
peggy exits the car and heads towards the school
charlie sits stunned
they are surrounded by friends as they head into school
near the door walter and leon are having a contest hoisting themselves onto the sign pole trying to get their bodies parallel to the ground
a crowd urges them on
we see taps on the bottom of walters shoes
peggy stands bewildered in the hallway
charlie walks back takes her by the hand and leads her to a locker
youre more shook up than you want to admit
youll get used to it well still see each other times a week
charlie opens the locker
peggy watches carefully memorizing tho combination
he takes out a few books as peggy notices her schedule on the locker door
want me to drive you home later
growling would i
why i oughta
unaccountably this cracks charlie up
he walks away laughing
peggy looks completely puzzled
she is surrounded by a sea of people who say hello
she cant remember their names
we see peggy maddy dolores arthur and carol singing my country tis of thee
they all mumble except for peggy who delivers a stirring rendition
the class thinks shes crazy
peggys decided to have a good time
announcements begin over the pa system
no one pays attention except peggy

maddy dolores and peggy enter the room
peggy stands at the door till most are seated
she sees an empty seat between maddy and dolores and assuming its hers sits down
did you study for the test
snelgrove an officious little creep is standing by his desk
all right class
he walks along the aisles collecting the papers
when he gets to peggy he picks up her blank sheet
whats the meaning of this peggy sue
snelgrove i happen to know that in the future i will never have the slightest use for algebra
and i speak from experience
the class gasps a few students applaud and mr
snelgroves jaw drops
gilfond is teaching the old man and the sea
michael fitzsimmons from reunion crosscountry photo is speaking
he always wears black
santiago comes back with nothing theres no meat on the bone
its hemingways ego defending itself again hes trying to prove he can still perform
what hemingways saying michael is that we are alone that when we go out too far were vulnerable
the irony that santiago is beaten by the sharks doesnt make him less of a hero
the bell rings
the class begins to exit
over the weekend read the first four chapters of the great gatsbv

she walks up to gilfond
gilfond can i talk to you

peggy carol and maddy walk over and sit down with trays
peggy deliberately avoids the empty sear next to charlie
theyre uneasy with each other
peggy looks with disgust at the slop on the tray
strange rumors are sweeping the school about you

peggy sees michael fitzsimmons buried in a book
he looks at peggy with a penetrating gaze then back down
richard norvik also sitting alone working with a slide ruler on a book of mathematical puzzles dressed in early nerd
peggy gets up from the table
she looks back to charlie and the table
ill be right back
shes not wasting any time
peggy sue and mr
hes a nice guy
you know hes writing a book
oh a book

fakes gagging peggy stands over richard
he looks up nervously pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose a constant habit
congratulations on the math contest richard
it really wasnt that difficult
doug snell of merrilllynch at the reunion walks past

on the walls are several charts basic food groups tips on grooming and prominently displayed the happy home corporation i
husband as president wife vicepresident children employees grandparents as board members
miss otto stands by her desk
standing in the front of the room is therefore the key to a successful childrens party can be summed up in one word planning
with proper planning a successful inexpensive happy birthday party can be had by all
including the mother
she walks back to her seat
that was very comprehensive madeline
beat peggy sue your topic was how to choose a nursery school
are you prepared
peggy walks to the front and faces the class smiling primly
choosing a good nursery school can be one of the most important decisions you can make
it will often determine your childs attitude towards education and schooling
proud of herself of course the lessons learned are primarily social sharing being considerate of others
remembering and theyre so cute when theyre little
they bring you back their little masterpieces every day and you put em on the refrigerator door
theyre so proud and their names are all misspelled
scott would always print his s backwards and beth would make her sweet little flowers
peggy wipes away a tear
at the stunned reaction of the class and miss otto
the baseball team practices
michael fitzsimmons runs laps with the track team
one lone boy kicks a soccer ball
widen to include the baton spinning down falling into the hands of a uniformed majorette who deftly passes it through her legs and twirls it back into the air
another baton it rises spinning awkwardly and falls through peggys hands onto the ground
six majorettes in uniform are practicing
dolores is one of them
to peggy what a girl
what a twirl
you know pegleggy youre gonna get demoted to hall monitor come on peggy sue
try it again
you havent been practicing
peggy gamely tries it again and manages at least to catch the baton and continue twirling
she continues enjoying herself
michael runs by the lonely long distance runner
the group of majorettes heads toward the school
peggy sees charlie leaning against the car waving her over
looking good out there
i noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch
i guess i deserved it
ive been thinking about my three year plan and i think its unworkable
i must have been delirious
i thought it had a lot of merit
in the abstract maybe
get a grip on yourself
but when i imagine you going out with other guys i feel
rejected worthless miserable
peggy turns and walks away
charlie looks miserable
peggy enters and approaches richard
he is too engrossed constructing an elaborate kite to notice her
what a great kite
im writing a book on kite construction
what did you want to talk about
i want to ask you a question
beat do you think
time travel is possible
are you doing some kind of science project
in a newtonian framework the possibilities were limited but with the advent of relativity theory the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed
peggy hasnt understood a word
and then theres richards burrito
thats my own theory based on a mexican food called the burrito
i had it once when my parents took me to disneyland
i know what a burrito is
well i think time is like a burrito
sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other
you can till it with whatever you want
from illusions to memory from experience to innocence from happiness to the entire universes so you think time travel is possible
people dogs elephants
listen youve gotta keep this a secret
you cant tell a soul
this is serious
nobody can know
ah ive returned from the future
i traveled back here years
you probably are crazy
wait a minute
is this some kind of joke
i know what you all think of me
youre the smartest person i know
it sounds unbelievable
but i can prove it
you have a blind grandfather
one day youre going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people
i read about it
youre going to be famous
youre going to invent a lot of things
how did you know about my grandfather
because im telling you the truth
i know whats going to happen
theres going to be test tube babies and heart transplants
and an american named neil armstrong is going to walk on the moon
thats six years ahead of schedule
peggy and richard are walking carrying their books
but when did you leave
are you here until then
were you there until now
what direction are you going in
are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past
can anyone do it
i dont know
oblivious peggy and richard walk by showers cafe
inside dolores and carol see them
id be very careful if i were you
you don t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain
thats why i was getting a divorce
beat what i really think is that i had a heart attack at the reunion and died
you look pretty good for a corpse
come on richard im serious
youre giving me the creeps
am i dead or not
theres one way to find out
richard stops and throws down his books
he steps in front of peggy throwing down her books dragging her to the curb
whatre you doing
confucious says the way out is through the door
theres a truck
theres your door
a large truck speeds towards them
step in front of the truck
if youre dead it wont matter
the truckll go right through you
peggy takes one step off the curb
the truck is getting closer
the truck blows a loud sustained wail
i dont want to die
a completely outfitted laboratory kites decorate the walls
okay youre not dead but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible
what if its beyond science
what it its god
einstein said god doesnt play dice with the universe
im a scientist
i believe that theres an order to things
why would god bring you back as a high school girl
i dont know
youre a molecule in chaos a discontinuent aberration
maybe youve just got powers of precognition
well maybe youre just out of whack
i told you ive already lived my life
i dont know how or why im here but you have to help me get back
i want to get back to my real life
all right ill work on it ill do some research
but in the meantime dont get crazy
ill see you tomorrow
heads out the door what if youre not here tomorrow
peggy comes home enters hallway
this necklace is sapphire it was my grandmothers
peggy looks into the living room
her mother is sitting on the sofa with a strange man in a suit
shes served him tea
there are several pieces of old jewelry spread on a cloth on the coffee table
the man is examining one of the pieces
kelcher seems surprised that peggys home from school
peggy moves on into the kitchen
peggy hears her mother let the man out
she enters the kitchen
who was that man
it was nobody
hes a poll taker
im thinking of voting democrat this year
but dont mention it to your father
how was school today
it was great to see everybody again
but its so boring and regimented
most of what they teach is useless
the worst thing was lunch
the telephone rings
would you get that dear
picking up the phone hello
kelcher turns to her
whats the matter
who is it
shaken its grandma
i cant talk to her now
into phone im sorry grandma
peggy hands the receiver to her mother and runs out of the room sobbing
her first confrontation with mortality
peggy climbs the stairs in tears
what is it
forcing herself to regain her composure she sits down at the top of the landing as mrs
kelcher joins her
what happened to you
i had a dream that grandma died
well she is getting on but shes fine
i told her you werent feeling well yesterday
she called to find out how you are
i love her so much and i havent seen her in such a long time

im confused about a lot of things right now
charlies only one of them
is charlie pressuring you to do things you dont think you should be doing
what do you mean
peggy do you know what a penis is
peggys jaw drops stay away from it
charlie pulls up to the curb opens the glove compartment extracts a can of old spice aerosol sprays the seat and exits his car throwing a kiss to it as
he walks up to the door
hes wearing a hideous orange and turquoise sweater
kelcher opens the door charlie enters
how are things at the hat store
come on in
i want to talk to you
camera tracks charlie and mr
kelcher into the living room
kelcher sits on his recliner charlie nervous on the couch
nancy is on the rug studying
you may have noticed that peggy sues been acting a little strange lately
she seems confused irresponsible overemotional
my wife says thats the way girls act sometimes
shes almost a juvenile delinquent
kelcher gives nancy a look and points to the door
without her father noticing nancy creeps up behind him and makes rabbit ears behind his head
charlie tries hard not to laugh
nancy continues to clown
but thats what i like about her
shes not like all the other girls at school
charles in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music weve always regarded you a a fine young man
weve trusted you with our daughter
trust is a twoway street
in the past two years ive been pleased to note that you and mrs
kelcher have uh fulfilled your sacred trust of being good parents to the uh woman i plan to take off your hands
kelcher looks as if hes witnessing the latest attack of teenage weirdness
peggy is changing a record
she sees the dress she was wearing the day before and at the reunion slung across a chair
as peggy picks it up a book of matches falls out
peggy picks it up excited
insert matchbook which reads finish high school in your spare time
peggy frantically searches the dress pockets and slowly draws out two joints
she stares at them for a beat
worrying oh beth
theres a knock at the door
peggy quickly hides the joints
kelcher opens the door
why arent you ready
i dont feel very festive
you accepted an invitation maddys one of your best friends and i baked the rice krispie squares
this is the best time of your life
and the sooner you learn to handle charlie the better
kelcher closes the door
we think this party might cheer her up
just make sure you know whats expected of you
what would that be sir
show her a good time but for gods sake restrain yourself
surprised of course
walking downstairs surprised by charlie and dad talking
peggy and charlie exit and walk towards his car
peggys holding a pan of rice krispie squares
charlie slips peggys sweater back on her shoulder
hes trying hard to make up
where did you get that sweater
great isnt it
its really fifties
you sort of clash with the world
whats the fun of being a teenager if you cant dress weird
and were going to have fun tonight right
i promised my mother

thirty kids are dancing talking snacking

walter leon terry and doug snell are crowded around a tv watching an old western with eugene pallette or edgar buchanan
the boys laugh as pallette or buchanan growls a western cliche
goldarnit dag nab it dad burn it dad blame it
charlie and peggy are poised at the door
here comes the life of the party
arthur and a few others stand by the bar where bottles of coke are lined up
arthur carefully pours rum from a hip flask directly into the bottles
peggy and charlie enter

walter leon charlie and terry crowd around arthur who has an open widemouthed bottle of beer in his hand
go arthur rapidly chugalugs the entire beer and immediately recites from memory as the boys urge him on going for speed hiyo silver
a cloud of dust a galloping horse with the speed of light a hearty hi yo silver
the lone ranger
with his faithful indian companion tonto the daring and resourceful masked rider of the plains came to earth with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men
return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear from out of the
arthur lets out a huge belch
everybody cracks up
you threw in superman
close to a record
foaming at the nose i hate it when the beer comes out my nose
peggy carol and maddy bemusedly watching the boys

you know i never could figure that one out
maddy arthur walter carol charlie and peggy sit on a couch
maddy and carol sit in their boyfriends laps
peggy sits distractedly on the couch arm
they cross talk boys to boys girls to girls
i was thinking of four ushers and four bridesmaids
the yanks got the hitting but the sox got the defense
what are your colors going to be
il take kubek and richardson over fox and aparicio
im thinking of pink and green
dolores and terry standing in a corner kissing passionately
look at dolores
what a tramp
pitching wins pennants
the tigers got four potential twenty game winners
youd be surprised at how many girls in school arent virgins
to carol like who
don mossi frank lary jim sunning and paul foytack
and now direct from three weeks of rehearsal in walters garage four guys who have dedicated their lives to becoming the greatest singing group in the world
beat charlie walter leon and terry
applause as the group enters from the furnace room
they all wear black pants and iridescent sharkskin jackets
charlie is in the center of the group as they position themselves
one two three
the group begins to sing an a capella version of rama lama ding dong or i wonder why
charlie sings lead backed up by the other three
walter dances insane temptationlike steps
the crowd huddles around them clapping and grooving
peggy is on the planet of lost innocence removed and melancholy
charlie really has a great voice
maybe theyll be the next dion and the belmonts
dont get your hopes up
come on wheres your enthusiasm
charlie sings directly to peggy grinning at her
in spite of herself she smiles back at him
shes starting to realize why she fell in love with him
he is kind of cute isnt he
youre so lucky
he really loves you too
hes always telling walter how wonderful you are
the group finishes the song
charlie blows peggy a kiss
the crowd applauds including peggy
dolores joins peggy carol and maddy
carol and i saw you with that creep richard today
first of all richard is not a creep
he happens to be an exceptional person
if any of you gave him half a chance youd find that out
god peggy youre so unformed youre practically fetal
youre just taking pity on him cause he has no friends
dolores cant you be a little kinder to people
you dont even know the boy
if you werent so neurotic and insecure maybe youd shut up for a while and show some compassion
are you for real
dolores storms away
to peggy i dont know what you said to her but i wish id said it
charlie and walter walk over and accept bravos from the girls
walter does his james dean imitation
charlie what do you think of richard norvik
is he gonna help you with that physics stuff
who needs physics when weve got chemistry
charmed come on lets dance
put on some makeout music and kill the lights
we hear a record scratch
a slow song begins
the lights are dimmed
coupler begin to slow dance
charlie holds peggy close barely moving
peggy is mistyeyed moved by being in charlies arms again
there isnt a girl in school that can hold a candle to you
youre pretty charming when you want to be
yeah i know
but i dont have to flatter you
it just feels right
youre the perfect girl for me
as in is was and always will be
im glad dancing was invented
you know the first dances were rituals
like fertility rites
as they dance charlie gets embarrassed by an erection and moves his hips away from peggy
she surprises him by grabbing his tush and pulling him into her
music fades into the song party doll by buddy knox
peggy is doing the twist showing charlie and several others
walter gets the hang of it twisting on one leg
carol tries to keep up
maddy and arthur are always a beat behind
hey terry what is that
did peggy make it up
ive never seen that on bandstand
what if were witnessing the end of touch dancing
the windows are fogged
peggy and charlie kiss tenderly
this is nice
i always loved the way you kiss
i missed you
your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight
and the tide rushes in
you really love me dont you
you know i do
i even wrote you into my will
tentatively charlie lets make love
you mean sex
nonbelieving you want to have intercourse
last weekend you said
what time is it
a lots happened since last weekend
but youre the one who wanted to wait till we got married
and you were right
we should wait
f ustered i probably meant it when i said it
beat coyly doesnt lucky chuckie want to come out
peggy starts to giggle realizing the absurdity of the situation
the more she giggles the more agitated charlie gets
peggy starts to unbutton charlies shirt
your love machine
the throbbing thrill hammer
you mean my wang
listen its running real late
charlie pushes her away angry
what is this
what the hell is going on
one week you say if you love me you wont now you say if you love me you will
beat excuse me
thats a guys line
peggy realizes shes blown it
charlie isnt ready for this
this is a mistake
we better forget it
youre damn right
you sure know how to spoil a mood
charlie straightens himself up starts the car and burns out
charlie drops her off
im sorry charlie
peggy watches him go
looking at her darkened house she turns and walks down the street
peggy peeks in the window
the kids from the party are eating and laughing
rosalie testa is dancing
shaken by rosalie she turns away
in the distance she sees the lights of a few people linger over coffee
the waitress serving them is monica the same but younger woman from lovin oven
in a corner michael fitzsimmons in a red leather jacket sits alone reading
he looks up to check on his motorcycle parked outside
hes splendid in his isolation
peggy enters taking a seat at the counter startled to see monica who doesnt know her
what would you like
arent you monica hines
who are you
can i have a coffee please
and a cinnamon cruller
sotto hows bobo
peggy notices michael staring at her
peggy smiles michael doesnt
monica brings peggy her coffee and donut
twenty cents please
picking up her donut and coffee she walks over to michaels table and sits opposite him
i was impressed with what you said in english class today
gilfonds okay except he thinks hemingways great literature
contemptuously hes a fisherman
the most overrated writer of the century
i mean hes the perfect american author fat violent drunk
maybe youre confusing his life with his work
a writers life is his work
jack kerouac doesnt have to kill a bull to have something to write about
hes out there feeling burning
grooving on life
michael leans back in his chair
hes said his piece
peggy studies him for a beat
the young man leaned back in his chair
no bulls would die today
whatre you doing here anyway
coffee and a donut
i thought chicks like you traveled in packs
hey man im a hip chick
long shot of the brightly lit donut shop
michael and peggy are clearly visible
dolores and terry are driving by
terry slow down
peggy and michael leave the donut shop get on michaels motorcycle
theres peggy with michael fitzsimmons
that commie beatnik
whats she doing with him
waitll i tell charlie
first a nerd and then a weirdo
what a bunch of nose pickers
ill tell charlie
peggy on michaels bike clasped around him
her eyes closed enjoying the wind blowing in her hair
they head out of town
michael pumps gas
peggy walks to the washrooms
looking around she waits a beat then enters the mens
with all the aplomb of a divorcee peggy takes a quarter and deposits it in a condom machine
she puts the packet in her skirt pocket pulls out the joints and stares at them for a beat
she checks her hair in the mirror and exits
michael pumps air into the tires bunched against a building
peggy approaches him holding up a joint smiling conspiratorially
she lights it inhales deeply then passes it to him
he smiles back at her a bit surprised but still takes the joint and inhales
they drive up to a mountain top peggy wearing the leather jacket
she directs michael with one arm
the motorcycle is parked
peggy and michael lie on the grass staring down at the town lights below
michael inhales the joint then passes it to peggy
this is great reefer
its really old
inhales travels well though
beat you know the world looks a lot better from up here
the world is fantastic
its the ultimate absurd circus
i am shot from a cannon into the energy
what are you shooting for
i cant wait to get out of here
im gonna write
im gonna check out of this bourgeois motel
push myself away from the dinner table and say no more jello for me mom
dont you get along with your parents
the only thing my father digs is cold green money
all my mother cares about is her standing at the country club
they care about you
theyre just a different generation
hey whats with you
i thought you were cool
you rode my bike
you blew some pot
beat whats your scene miss majorette
you gonna marry mr
blue impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life
i already did that
i want to be a dancer i want to dance
peggy takes off her sweater kicks off her shoes and begins to dance
her eyes are closed her body silhouetted by the moon
michael is transfixed
after a few beats he walks over to her
he stretches out his arms and places them around her neck
they sway together for several beats their bodies touching
peggy opens her eyes and sees michael gazing at her tenderly
you know i had you pegged all wrong
michael kisses peggy
she responds passionately
a ray of oneness piercing the solitude
falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh
youll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire
is that one of your poems
no i just made that up
do you want to hear one
id love to
eyes ablaze okay
heres a new one
its called tenderness
beat i couldnt sleep so i thought id scream betrayed by a kiss sucking pods of bitterness
in the madhouse of dr
dread razor shreds of rat puke fall on my bare arms sees peggy grimace he calms down im sorry
i guess i was trying to impress you
kisses her peggy is falling for it
he fumbles with her bra straps
youre as good as you looked
his other hand reaches to undo her skirt
ill respect you for eternity
reciting tenderly when you are old and gray and full of sleep and nodding by the fire take down this book and slowly read and dream of the soft look
your eyes had once
beat i didnt write that
peggy is moved by the beauty of the poem
she sits up leans over michael runs her hand through his hair almost motherly
i envy you
you have your whole life ahead of you and you know exactly what you want to do
beat but forget the rat puke write something beautiful
peggy lies back down on the ground
michael takes her hand and kisses it
you know this isnt really happening
camera pulls back to include the entire perfect tableau the starry night the motorcycle the clouds racing across the moon and the two lovers on the mountaintop
michael stops at the corner of peggys street
she gets off the bike and kisses michael goodbye
he takes off
peggy walks up the path as the milkman approaches
your parents are waiting up
you know i see a lot of this in the spring
peggy enters trying to be quiet
kelcher stands in the kitchen doorway in his bathrobe waiting for her steaming
camera tracks peggy into kitchen
she grabs a cup of coffee before sitting down
where have you been
i went for a drive
up in the hills
damn that charlie i its not charlie
nervously peggy let me ask you something
beat youre not
expecting are you

thank god for that
its not a big deal
didnt you ever stay out all night when you were young
yes but i was a boy
and i still had hell to pay
just listen for a minute
but this better be good
i want to help with the family finances
i want you to buy some stocks
by gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce
then you sell
do you know how ridiculous you sound
first of all its illegal for u
citizens to buy gold
and in the second place the price of gold is regulated by the government
i think theyre going to deregulate it
thats your problems the more women think the more trouble they get into
oh boy thats another thing thats going to change
whos going to think for us
you know you treat mom like a maid
its not entirely your fault
those were the attitudes in the fifties and thats the way you raised me
but give nancy a break encourage her to go to art school
ive heard just about enough of this lunacy
go to your room
listen dad please
buy ibm buy polaroid buy apple computer
evelyn take her to her room
peggy stalks out of the kitchen to the front door
im not the maid
way to go mom
the kelchers glare at each other
we hear the door slam
peggy and richard sit in a booth
richards kite is hung on a coat rack
the way i see it you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world
im just not the type
besides i want to get out of here
but you have a vision
dont you want to help your parents
i tried to tell them but they wouldnt listen to me
im talking about invention no investment
i know what people think of me
dick the square root
ill show them
you said i was going to be a millionaire
and youre gonna help
richard take it easy
no offense but for a person who says shes lived an extra lifetime you certainly are thick
money is power
money makes people respect you
how come you never ask me any important questions
dont you wonder if theres going to be a nuclear war
or a cure for cancer
what about your family
what about people
im curious but i dont want to know
jeez i hope you havent been telling people whats going to happen to them
give me some credit will you
i like that in a partner
wbatre you talking about
look its very simple
you tell me everything that hasnt been invented yet and ill invent it
well be partners
thats not fair
okay find yourself another vision
youre taking advantage of a minor
when do we start
a waitress approaches their table
do you know what you want
a ton on a bun with fries
quiche lorraine spinach salad and a perrier
the street is filled with saturday shoppers
peggy holds the kite richard takes notes as they windowshop
they stop in front of a dry cleaners
no real change
just higher prices
they move next door to a shoe store
this is a biggie
running shoes jogging shoes tennis shoes
fifty to two hundred dollars a pair
you cant be serious
there are major fortunes to be made here
leisure time and lifestyles
are you talking about exercise
not for you
okay theres lots more
they move along to the next window an appliance store
the window is filled with old televisions record players large rotisseriebroilers etc
the store sign reads bodells tv and appliances
another sign reads come in and listen to look at that stuff
its like the dark ages
this is more your speed
and boy do i know this business
peggy peers into the store again and catches a g impse of charlie serving a customer
peggy and richard sit on the bench next to two old
richard reads from his list
looking around icrowavemays ocketpay alculatorcays
the two ladies react
you dont have to use pig latin
nobody could possibly know what were talking about
these are the choices microwave ovens pocket calculators walkmans digital watches and miniature tvs
and huge portable radios
everything else gets small but for some reason portable radios get enormous
peggy looks up and sees a lingerie store across the street
she heads towards it calling ill be right back
peggy enters the lingerie store
after a beat peggy emerges from the store excited and empty handed
dodging traffic she hurries back to richard
they dont have any
they never heard of them
isnt that wonderful
what are you talking about
the wave of the future
ive decided on our first fortune
ill see you later
you just think high tech
i like the sound of that
at the back is a small record department complete with a listening booth
charlie is waiting on a customer
charlies father is waiting on a buxom young woman his arm around her shoulder
he turns around as she enters
she has a shock of recognition
to young woman look at that freezer chest
to peggy embarrassed hello peggy sue
how ya doing
fine just fine
peggy gives him a big hug and a kiss on the cheek
nice to see you
charlies in the back
peggy walks towards the back as mr
bodell explains my future daughterinlaw
very affectionate girl
charlie talks to on elderly gentleman
ill just take the ravel
take the shostakovich home and listen to it
let it grow on you
everyone thats bought it has come back and said this is definitive shostakovich
thank you for encouraging me to investigate it
well i did enjoy the dvorak you suggested
young man you talked me into it
charlie points peggy to the listening booth
youll like it
i kid you not
peggy sits on the chair
a turntable sits on a small desk
record covers decorate the walls
charlie enters and sits on the desk his feet resting on peggys chair
what do you know about classical music
selling is selling
about last nights
ive been thinking
girls must go through that stuff too
sometimes when i look at you i feel like an animal
maybe my dads right
teenagers are nuts
but im not
im a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldnt possibly understand
yeah i know
girls mature faster than guys
but last night i was the one who put on the brakes
and you know why
charlie cups her face in his hands pouring out his heart
because nothing else matters
thats the great thing about love
every time we argue every time something goes wrong and i know that im not perfect either things just work out better in the end
cause youre my baby and i love you
what am i going to do with you
dont be cruel to a heart thats true
alone in the store mr
kelcher is going through some receipts
peggy enters carrying a shopping bag
doing some shopping
peggy reaches into the shopping bag and pulls out a small wrapped box
he opens the present
inside are a pair of miniature golf ball cufflinks
sweetheart theyre beautiful
but they mustve been expensive
across the street an ice cream truck pulls up
mothers fathers and children crowd around the back as the driver exit the cab
i closed my christmas club
good you got your money out of that greedy bank
i wanted to apologize for this morning
its hard to believe youre going to be eighteen
looks out the window want an eskimo pie
or a creamsicle
id come home from the store and theres little you running up to me
id give you a dime and youd promise never to grow up
this morning was good
the hat business is in trouble
i that what all that nonsense was about this morning
youre worried about my business
thats very thoughtful honey
its just a slump
things will pick up
but when john f
kennedys elected president men l stop wearing hats
kennedys a catholic
hell never win
gravely closing her eyes hell win
richard nixons going to be president
nixon wears hats
peggy is helping her sister nancy with an art project
you think thisll cheer dad up
of course hell love it
youre a terrific artist
we hear mr
kelcher arguing loudly from downstairs
the two girls freeze
i dont need your charity
i dont need your grandmothers jewelry or your parents money how could you do that
please dont shout
peggy opens the door nancy cautiously behind
im not shouting
have we ever starved
have we ever missed a mea
kelcher moves around the room closing the windows
does everybody have to hear
i want everybody to hear because i dont have anything to be ashamed of
kelcher collapses into his barcalounger red as a beet
jack i was just trying to help
well make it well be fine
nancy is frightened
does this mean were going to be poor
peggy leads her back into her room without letting her parents know they were there
we hear the song stranger in paradise from kismet on the old black and white record player from opening scene
peggy sits on the floor surrounded by stockings leotards and a sewing basket
she cuts the legs oft a pair of leotards
in one hand she holds up the top half of the leotards in the other hand a pair of nylon stockings
we hear a knock on the bedroom door
peggy pushes everything under the bed as maddy and carol enter
whats the scoop
how come were your best friends and we had to find out about you and michael fitzsimmons from dolores
who needs satellites when weve got doloress mouth
i hear she does more than talk with her mouth
brushing her hair oh maddy grow up
it says in love without fear that the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it
did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts
just what you underlined
carol you have beautiful hair
whats with you and michael
hes so cool and mysterious
hes very interesting
for all his pretending to be a tough guy hes really got the soul of a poet
i bet dolores told charlie
that loudmouthed little bitch peggy sue
you better watch out for her
shes after charlie
cool it kids
hes free to see other girls if he wants
but i always thought that you would marry charlie carol would marry walter and i would marry arthur
wed all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every sunday
itll spoil everything if you and charlie break up
that michael doesnt look like the barbecue type
im not going to marry him
i just went out with him once
beat i know
why dont we go to the movies tonight
just us girls
itll be fun
dont be silly
ive gotta go
arthurs picking me up soon
but lets have a girls night soon
maybe a pajama party
arent we a little old for that
sometimes youre so immature
peggy turns to face her parents holding up her homemade pantyhose with a flourish
the death of the garter belt
of course once theyre manufactured theyll look better than this
what do you think
this is your great invention
kelcher would you wear those things
would they go over my girdle or under
instead of a girdle
and light as a feather
jack i think shes got something there
and we wont just sell them in department stores
well market them in drug stores and supermarkets
thats all well and good but we dont have the money to manufacture them
you need a partner
theres a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars mr
ive invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night
isnt that awfully forward
weve got to move fast
this is an idea whose time has come
you mean to tell me that you invited this mr
fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea
a breeze blows through the open window peggy sleeps fitfully tossing off the covers
we hear noises from outside her window
a figure appears outside and silently climbs into the bedroom
peggy mumbles charlies name
the man walks over to her bed as peggy reaches out for him tenderly as if they were still married
i just had the strangest dream
whispering i have to talk to you
through her sleepclouded eyes peggy begins to focus on the face of the younger charlie
suddenly she remembers
what are you doing here
angry lets go down to the basement
peggy enters flicks on the light and leads charlie in
peggy senses charlies anger and steels herself for the inevitable confrontation
i want to know whats going on
dolores told me that you and that scuzzball michael fitzsimmons
i bumped into him after you dropped me off last night
i didnt feel like going home so we went for a ride
furious then its true dammit
i had a miserable time tonight cause of you
when the monotones did book of love chapter four you break up wont you give it just one more chance
im thinking did we break up
cause if we did i dont even know about it
i thought we cleared all that up yesterday
did that maynard g
beatnik give you what you wanted
you know i never could stand your sarcasm
youre going to blow it peggy sue
nobody treats charlie bodell like this
and why do you always refer to yourself in the third person like napoleon
how come it always turns into an argument with you
look ive got the hair got the eyes got the teeth i got the car
im the lead singer im the man
ive been trying to postpone this
but whats the point
crying i dont want to hurt you
this is very hard for me
im doing this for both of us
i really want you to be happy
i will be happy if i have you
i love you
that wont make any difference
we just cant live together
and you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo janet
what are you talking about
i just cant trust you anymore
what about everything i said to you this afternoon
thats just it
you can always get to me
theres this window in my heart and every time i leave it open you climb in
unless i close it now nothings ever going to be different
but what has to be different
i have a good head for business i should be franchising the bakery
and i want you to give me your word that whatever happens youll go to college
what about the group and my singing career
what about me
im trying to save you years of frustration
waiting for a big break
waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me
you dont know zip
you think im going to end up selling appliances like my father
chasing women around the store
ive got to give it a shot
why are you trying to kill the two things that mean the most to me
until yesterday you loved me and you loved us
opening the door what the hell has changed
for two years ive done nothing but love you
ill show you im going to be just like fabian
peggy slumps back drained
getting up she crosses to the mounted swordfish
standing on a chair she reaches into the mouth of the fish and pulls out a package of pall malls
she puts a cigarette in her mouth and picks up a table lighter and flicks it
as it lights the tiny music box inside plays smoke gets in your eyes
we hear distant church bells
peggy sits down to scan the large sunday newspaper
seeing her mothers phone book she finds the number she needs and picks up the phone
she dials slowly
very nervous hello grandma
its peggy sue
how are you
im very sorry about the other day
peggy jogs towards richard
he is watering the front lawn
breathless hi richard
what are you doing
i was running now im jogging
thats what you were talking about yesterday
everybody does that in the future
its going to be a law
beat i broke up with charlie last night
you did it
you really changed the course of your destiny
it was an unfair fight
he didnt have a chance
im taking a real gamble
i loved him for a long long time
now you can give some other guy a shot
make it up to him later and buy him a yacht
for gods sake forget the money
im going crazy
im a walking anachronism
im a puddle of deja im worried about my kids scott must be scared to death i think my daughters doing drugs again
i cant have any fun here i dont have that innocence any more
i cant keep all this in anymore
i feel like im going to explode
look the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case
may i make a suggestion
why didnt i think o that before
what do you know about hypnosis
this is perfect
the subconscious mind remembers all
you can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion
maybe thatll give us a clue on how to get you back
look im desperate
ill try anything
but what if you cant snap me out of it
no offense but youre pretty out of it now
peggy sits in an old recliner
richard holds a small batteryoperated revolving disc up in front of peggys closed eyes then puts it down and picks up a notepad and pen
you are completely relaxed
when i count to three you will open your eyes
peggys eyes flutter open well start with something easy
what is your name
trancelike peggy sue kelcher
beat or peggy bodell
beat im not sure
peggy what are microchips
theyre very tiny
they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set
what will they be made of
i think its called silicon
charlie told me that
silicon is from sand
we were lying in the sand
it was my eighteenth birthday
we were so awkward
i would have married him anyway
peggy starts to shift in the chair
her shorts hike up her legs spread slightly
this is not lost on richard
weird guttural sounds begin to emanate from his throat
in the future will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her
the pill will change all that
then he wouldnt have blamed me
we were just too young
you mean youll give a girl a pill and shell want to have sex
the pill will be for birth control
but girls do like sex
maybe not the first time
will you take of f your blouse
yes every day
taking her blouse off getting spaced maybe i shouldnt have worn that dress
i told beth it was a bad idea
thats why they made me queen
peggys meandering makes richard nervous
richard are you in there
richard frantically tries to put peggys blouse back on
shes limp and unresponsive
ill be right out dad
urgent oh shit
peggy im going to snap you out of it
i couldnt help it i loved him
claps twice you are now awake
richard kneels on top of peggy as she wakes up fumbling the buttons at her breasts
peggy comes to as richard jumps off
she buttons her blouse furious
you should be ashamed of yourself
you went crazy
you started taking your clothes off
i was putting them back on for you
thats just perfect isnt it
did it work
did you find out why i came back
i think it has something to do with your birthday
you were rambling
i didnt understand the rest
howm i gonna got out of here
peggy grabs a glass beaker and hurls it against the wall
do you have any idea how much those beakers cost
i usually charge for hypnosis
oh go feel up your hamsters
i hear rodents put out
peggy storms out
kelcher stands at the counter preparing a pot roast
peggys making a chocolate mousse
you know dear i think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea but the next time you come up with something please dont stay out all night
just tell us
well believe you
mom how about a machine thats like your blender only it slices vegetables kneads dough chops meat and even make fresh pasta
peggy and mrs
kelcher are setting the table taking the good china out of the cabinet
a dozen red roses grace the table
these roses are beautiful
and so romantic
who is this michael
is he a friend of charlies
she moves the jell o mold
no just a friend of mine
i dont think he likes jello
what does charlie think about that
you know mom its okay to have male friends
besides its over with me and charlie
when did it happen
your dad and i always expected you two to get married
yeah i know peggy sue gets married
mom if you could live your life over again would you do the same thing
get married and settle down after high school
of course i loved your lather
i remember once being offered a scholarship to art school
but i turned it down
all the college girls i knew were so well dressed
i was worried that i wouldnt fit in
i didnt have the right clothes
i was so silly
but i dont have many regrets and besides r dont have time to worry about the past
i hope you know what youre doing
michael doris and ed fitzsimmons sit at the table with the kelchers
they have just finished dessert
i never thought id have moose for desert
the adults laugh
michael looks bored
peggy sue cooked the whole dinner
but mom helped
you know you should open a restaurant
its incredibly difficult to make money in the restaurant business
you have to get up at five in the morning to go to the market you have problems with spoilage employee pilferage and just try and collect from the credit
they take months to pay
the whole table is astonished
how does a young gal like you know so much about business
oh i just picked it up from my dad
hes a wonderful businessman
peggy gives her father a go get him look
michaels writing in a pocket notebook
ah ed why dont you and i adjourn to the den for a while
peggy and michael stand by michaels motorcycle passing a cigarette
that was quite an evening
bourgeois phony decadent stupid
i shouldnt have put you through that
it must have been agony
lets do something
michael makes a move towards peggy with lust in his eyes
im too full
besides its a school night
michael and peggy pull up on the motorcycle in front of lenas lounge a seedy bar in the towns black ghetto
half a dozen blacks are banging around outside
they eye peggy and michael suspiciously
the room has a bar at one side booths and tables in the rest of the room
a stage is at the far end
on stage an all black group the fourmations is performing the song good timin the people in the club are dancing the twist
peggy and michael sit in the last booth
several people wave hello to michael
although peggy and michael can see the stage their booth is not visible from the stage
five more weeks of school
and ten minutes past graduation im gone
he raises his glass to freedom
looking around at the crowd clinking glasses for everyone
now listen this is the plan
as soon as school is finished we go to utah and
i thought youd be going to new york or paris
whats in utah
i met her last summer
youll really dig her
shes got this great little cabin in the hills just outside of provo where she raises chickens
ill write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us
astounded i cant do that
polygamys legal in utah
i hate chickens
on stage the fournations have concluded their song
we hear applause
now were happy to introduce a friend of ours
hes one damn fine singer mr
we hear the grove begin the song sea of love
but what about the other night
we were like two stars in the same constellation
michael you and i are light years apart
you should go but not with me
but we had heat baby
we owe it to ourselves to fuse together
beat at least one more time
thats a terrific line
youre going to be a wonderful writer
you think so
we had a glorious night together
one day youll remember and write about it
i can dig that
dogs of lust on leashes of memory
suddenly distracted by the familiar voice peggy looks up to the stage and sees that the lead singer charlie bell is in fact charlie bodell
what a treat
michael observes peggys intimate reaction to charlies singing
now i get it
peggy sues still stuck on treble without a cause
charlie finishes the song as the audience goes wild
i thought i knew everything about him
can we split now
peggy and michael unobtrusively slip out of the club
charlie leaves the stage
hes met by a greasy looking man
they sit down at a booth to talk
michael and peggy pull up
peggy gets off the bike and gives michael a goodnight kiss
i can dig you being uptight about rita and utah
but ive got to warn you about something
hes not just the ultimate square
hes a total crook
kelcher finishes the dishes with rubber gloves on
kelcher sits cleaning his pipe
how did it go with the pantyhose
its the darndest thing
ed knew what they were immediately
as a matter of fact he said hes got a product like that in development right now
didnt call them pantyhose though
what was it evelyn
catchy name isnt it
hes a liar
he has no such thing
its my own fault
i should have had it patented first
hes a crook damnit
peggy sue watch your mouth
fitzsimmons is a very prominent man
oh youre both so naive
look young lady i grew up through the depression
i fought in the second world war
six days a week i get up and deal with the public the bank and the bill collectors
and on the seventh day when god rests i dont have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool
you have a point dear
peggy lies in bed in the darkness her eyes wide open
the bedside clock reads
peggy gets out of bed
camera tracks peggy into nancys room
peggy looks down at nancy sleeping
gently pulling back the blankets peggy gets into bed with her
peggy walks down a residential street much like her parents
she stops when she sees charlies car parked in a driveway and leans against a tree next to his car
moments later charlie exits his house a dog trailing behind him
the dog runs up to peggy
charlie is wary and distant
whatre you doing here
i wanted to talk to you and i have one last thing to take care of at school
then im going to
pats dog good dog rusty
thats ajax charlie throws a stick
ajax chases it never comes back
i guess i always liked rusty better
beat could you give me a ride to school
sorry the blue thunders out of commission for a while
well how about a walk charlie bell
howd you know about that
i was at lenas last night
you were terrific
not terrific enough
what were you doing in that part of town
who were you with
what were you doing there
you never told me you were singing with an r and b group
i guess theres a lot of things we dont know about each other
charlie and peggy walking
id forgotten how much music meant to you
thats real big of you
stop being defensive
i want to help you
i wrote a song for you
you wrote a song
is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy
she wants to hurt him and he wonders why
peggy takes a piece of paper from her purse
not exactly but with your great voice itll be a huge hit
you know lee wilkins came to hear me last night
he told me to forget it
you told me to forget it
my parents tell me to forget it
just take a look at it
hands him the lyric if you took the trouble to write it then sure ill take a look at it
but im beginning to think that maybe theres more to life than music
i wonder if people would still like me if i stopped being mr
peggy and charlie stand by their open locker
does this mean you like me again
it means i care about you and what happens to you
thats all i wanted to hear
cause im never going to give up on us
its easy to fall apart in a crisis
its easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck
but this is more than love
this is a mental decision
just wait till tomorrow when you see your birthday present
then youll understand
charlie walks away as peggy reaches into the locker for her books
peggy i have to talk to you
peggy turns to carol
they walk down the hallway together
whats the matter
its that jerk walter
after charlie told walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field walter decided he should do the same thing
welcome to the singles scene
what a i going to do for the rest of my life
i dont have a boyfriend anymore
look carol maybe walters done you a big favor
you always said you wanted to get out of town
go for it
and be happy goddamnit im rooting for you
walter walks up to charlie
hey charlie what do you think of this
walter does a totally demented dance step finishing by strumming his leg like a guitar
he stands there grinning
walter maybe you should be a dentist
peggy sits at her desk organizing her books
we hear the end of the announcements over the p
and finally our heartiest congratulations to our girls diving team for placing second in the county finals last friday
and a special accolade to rosalie testa who placed first in every one of her events
were proud of you rosalie
everybody turns toward rosalie and applauds
peggy turns to rosalie trembling
the bell rings as the class starts to leave still crowded around rosalie
peggy stares after her frozen in her seat dolores approaches
whats the matter princess
lost your prince
peggy looks up at dolores and starts to seethe
she stands up slowly and faces dolores
you know dolores theres a lot of things i could say to you but youre not worth the effort
peggy reaches down to up her books
on the top of the pile is an open fountain pen which she picks up pul ing the release lever squirting ink all over doloress dress
dolores drops her books looks down at her dress horrified
these fountain pens are so tricky
you did that on purpose
i hate you
go gargle with razor blades
i beg your pardon
take a long walk on a short pier
have a nice day
peggy sits disconsolate on a bench watching the other girls changing into their swim suits
rosalie is in the shower room wetting down her suit
she accepts congratulations from a number of the girls
the bell rings as the girls begin to exit to the pool
rosalie turns at the door smiling
they are alone
i think you should give up diving
dont be silly im the best in the county
i know you are but you have to stop
i couldnt tell you before i didnt know if i should
but you have to stop before you hurt yourself
i spend three hours a day practicing
i have trainers i know what im doing
but accidents can happen
not to me they dont
im going to win the state then the
nationals and then im going to the olympics
rosalie please listen to me
you have to stop
you should go to the nurse
im going to tell miss dennis
rosalie exits into the pool area
peggy feels helpless
peggy walks down the hall a set of double doors leading to the pool just ahead of her through them she sees rosalie diving through the air with the careless
innocence of youth
burdened with the inevitability of it all she rushes through the hall and is stopped by richard
whats the matter
its all gone wrong nothings working out
i think im making real progress on the microchip
you were meant to
youre one of those fortunate people that good things happen to
i have to get out of here
she starts to walk away
peggy i believe you
i believe everything you told me
youre the exception that proves the rule
she kisses him on the forehead
i love you too richard
thanks for trying
she continues down the hallway
peggy heads out the door sees charlie
wait a minute
peggy stops on the landing
charlie joins her so eager
he doesnt notice how distraught she is
i cut shop and did some work on your song
you know its not half bad for your first try
of course i changed all the yeahs to oohs
listen to this
charlie begins to sing an r b version of she loves you
forget it itll never work
listen i cancelled the tickets for fabian
i thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant chez tres
walter arthur maddy and carol watch as peggy runs away
intercut the bus peggy looking out the window the rural scenery pastures barns etc
the other passengers
peggys grandparents elizabeth and barney alvorg wait in the front of the station
peggy sees her grandparents waiting for her
she grips the window rail tightly trying to hold herself together
everybody gettin off at dumont
here we are
peggy stands and reaches above to take down her suitcase
nervous she drops it
a man getting off the bus helps her picking it up
no trouble at all
the man gets off the bus
peggy stands at the door of the bus hesitant
elizabeth and barney approach the bus waving and smiling up at her
peggy slowly walks down the steps moved to tears
she approaches her grandparents and drops her suitcases
she hugs them tightly
the bus door closes and the bus pulls away behind them
barney is behind the wheel of a plymouth
elizabeth is in front peggy curled up in the back regressing
quite a bit more rain than usual this year
i hope it doesnt spoil the rhubarb
ive already got some in
i was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight
turning around to peggy how would you like that
like a little girl fine
beat grandma would you teach me how to make strudel
thats a days work
but if thats what you want maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday
peggy and elizabeth finish up the dishes chatting
a fire blazes in the fireplace
a grandfather clock stands prominently in the room
the clock from peggys house
peggy sits with elizabeth learning how to knit
barney laughs at the burns and allen show on tv
suddenly peggy places her hand over her heart and shivers with fear
whats the matter lilla
somebody jump on your grave
peggy shivers again and shakes her head
elizabeth enters carrying a tray with cups of cocoa
they each take a cup
you know peggy sue your mother said you had a dream that i died
i wish she hadnt
im not afraid
i know exactly when im going to die
peggy is perplexed by her grandmothers apparent lack of fear
whats it going to be elizabeth
im not telling
ive been trying to drag it out of her for years
beat you know dreams are fascinating business
specially where you see the future
do you believe in all of that
well i like to speculate
this book im reading right now a woman in colorado says she lived in ireland a hundred and fifty years ago
her name was bridey murphy and she gives names and dates and where she lived
she was hypnotized
i remember that book
beat grandpa grandma i want to tell you something
peggy and elizabeth are making strudel
if you believe it darling then i believe
being young can be just as confusing as being old
the things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday
but im remembering the future
right now youre just browsing through time
choose the things youll be proud of
the things that last
my children make me happy
i miss them so much
scott and beth
beat im going to name my daughter after you
peggy and barney are washing the car at a standpipe two hundred feet from the house
its gonna rain again
every time i wash the car it rains
that never changes

elizabeth is tying barneys bow tie
peggy is sitting with a jacket on

barney turns and winks at peggy
it was my idea grandma
i always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings
he wont tell me but ive got my suspicions
and i dont want any of that
dont keep her out late
hugging elizabeth goodbye grandma

barney and peggy open the door and exit
peggy and barney approach the car
what does grandma think you do at your meetings
peggy chuckles as they get into the car
the car proceeds along the driveway and turns onto the highway
barney is at the wheel
i may be an old fool but i think we can help you
i hope so
at least i got to see you and grandma
beat has it ever worked before
the last one was six hundred years ago
its about time for another one
a onestory pitchroof building
the sign over the entrance reads
the order of the golden dawn
underneath the sign is a logo of a spreading sunrise
peggy and barney pull up to the front exit the car and enter the building
thirty old men are congregating around the cloak room
most are already dressed in long purple robes with the sunrise logo over their hearts
they either wear or carry tricorner hats
peggy and barney enter
several men approach them
peggy nervously clings to barney s arm
welcome peggy sue
its nice to have you with us
you know youre a lucky girl
you could lay a bear trap in the aisle of the cathedral and never catch a better man than your grandfather
let me take your jacket lilla
ive got to get my robe
peggy hands him her jacket as he heads over to the cloak room
you know this is very exciting for all of us
weve been waiting a long time for someone like you
barney rejoins them wearing his hat and robe
the group begins to enter the main room
nervous do you have to wear that hat
it wouldnt be a lodge without hats
barney takes her hand and squeezes it
they walk slowly through the doorway
dont you worry
ill be watching after you
a large meeting hall
the room is draped and brightly lit with fluorescent lights
at one end sits a large gold painted wood throne
on either side are large candle holders with lit candles
a small table serves as an altar in front of the platform
on a footstool is a potted plane with an artificial bird perched on its top
the throne and altar look like a set left over from a summer stock macbeth
peggy and barney enter
several men lead peggy away from barney to the throne
one man places a go den cape around her shoulders
they lead her up the platform to the throne
get the lights
the lights are dimmed
the room is lit by the candles
the men form a semicircle around peggy
old men at the end of their lives they are serious and passionate about the possibilities of life beyond this world
one by one four men from either end of the line approach the altar with offerings a cup of wine an egg a gold coin and a rose
the men rejoin the line
leo cooper a tall whitehaired man takes two steps forward
the other men begin to sing a gregorian chant
to peggy are you ready dear
leo steps back closes his eyes and spreads his arms
fasten your seat belts
here we go
lord of the universe vast and mighty one
ruler of light king of the sun
creator of earth air fire and water
kneeling down we adore thee and invoke thee
grant thine aid
look with favor upon us as we witness the regeneration of man
we behold the innocent endeavors of singleminded men and women
for we are the company of unbodied souls and immortal angels
we ask thy intervention that this girl may return to thee on the wings of your love
sotto this is never going to work
the old men form a circle in front of peggy
they begin to circumambulate east to west intoning together their heads bowed
as barney passes in front of peggy he winks at her
she smiles back
fount of life chariot of the spirit womb of the mother reclaim thy child of light
we hear a clap of distant thunder
the artificial bird falls off the plant
peggy is struck with amazement
she begins to glow poised to take off
the men continue to chant while the name of your love is sacrifice
we offer up this girl that her soul may find its home
suddenly a door is opened a gust of wind pours in and extinguishes the candles plunging the hall into darkness
nothing to worry about
somebody get the lights
the lights are turned on
all the men look to the throne
peggy is gone
they are speechless for a couple of beats
chipper well the girls gone
lets play some poker
close on barney he smiles happy that she made it
george crosses to the wall reaches behind the drapes and presses a button
the wall slides open to reveal a fullyequipped card room
the men shuffle in
charlie carries peggy off towards his car one hand covering her mouth
when they reach the car he puts her down
shes still wrapped in her golden robe
what the hell did you do that for
what are you doing here
i was trying to save you
they were going to vaporize you
dont be ridiculous
theyre just a bunch of harmless old men
my grandfather was in there
youre going to listen to me
charlie tries to lead peggy into the car
im not getting in that blue monstrosity
charlie pushes her inside peggy climbs back out
charlie takes her hand and drags her up a hill behind the lodge hall
let me got
where are you taking me
now sit down
charlie sits her down on the ground
shes impatient and hopping mad
i wanna tell you
i forgive you for everything
i know what youve been going through
youre just scared
i was scared too but im not anymore
how could you possibly know what ive been going through
thunder and lightning
it starts to rain
because i love you damnit
i had a long talk with your father yesterday and we decided that the best thing for us to do is get married and settle down
peggy jumps up exploding to charlie
what do you mean you and my father decided
who the hell are you to plan my life
lets get married and live happily ever after
i got knocked up
i had to marry you
i never had a choice
you betrayed me charlie
you were never there for me or the children
and now you come and tell me peggy youre scared
of course im scared
if you knew what i knew youd be scared shitless
youre really out of your mind
i might be crazy but im not crazy enough to marry you twice
theres a lot of things i cant change
i cant even think about them
but i couldnt even help rosalie
tears start i dont want to be bitter
im a naturally optimistic person
but you took advantage of that
charlie bends down to comfort her in tears
he hugs peggy and strokes her hair
my poor peggy
its all my fault
im so sorry
i wont bother you anymore
please stop crying
peggy starts to compose herself
will you take me back to my grandparents
charlie helps her up
be reaches into his pocket and takes out a small box handing it to peggy
its almost your birthday
i wasnt sure when you were coming back so i brought your present up here
with a slow growing remembrance peggy opens the box
inside is the gold locket peggy was wearing at the reunion
anguished oh charlie
it opens too
peggy opens the locket
she shivers with recognition
two photos one of peggy one of charlie as children
scott and beth
where did you get these
whos scott and beth
your mother gave me our picture
thats you and me
so are scott and beth
peggy leans into charlie throwing her arms around him holding on for dear life
she looks up at him their foreheads touching
tenderly i love you
charlie kisses her passionately
the locket drops to the ground
hold on the locket and
charlie and peggy are lying on the ground gazing up
a flash of lightning streaks across the sky
i think we should get out of here
its going to rain
musing do you think anybody in the fifties ever made love on a bed
what the hell is that
flying high above them is an enormous glowing liquid neon kite
the center of the kite inscribed in lights flashing like a marquee happy birthday peggy sue
the kite begins to descend towards them
peggy jumps to her feet and races towards it
she grabs the tail and starts to sail away with the kite
charlie chases after her
wherere you going
ive got to go now
but i love you
ill love you forever
ill love you too charlie
ill love you for twenty years
come back to me
as charlie watches helplessly a huge bolt of lightning strikes his car
the men from the lodge run outside
they look up and above the blazing car and see peggy floating away
peggy sees her grandfather in the crowd and blows him a kiss
charlie begins to run following the kite cord to its source
he finds richard struggling to restrain the runaway kite
richard do something
its out of control
suddenly the cord breaks
peggy floats away
charlie richard and the old men behold peggy bobbing and dipping playfully in the sky
we begin to hear charlies voice singing peggy sue o
peggy looks down with wonder at the earth and then like a comet soars into the blackness
in an instant she becomes a star
moving from two to c
peggy fragments of the reunion the cake coming towards her fragments of words in echo effect your heart stopped for a while
fathers voice youre a very lucky young lady
doctor a explain of the head
moms voice but youre going to be all right now the paramedics got there
mom we were so worried
echoing of until once voice is left
sitting opposite her bed as he has been every minute of her illness
he looks wan and old worried sick but trying to sing peggy sue for her
peggy sue i love you and i need you peggy sue
was i dead
i thought you were
for a while
affectionately you look awful like you havent slept in days
and so old
very happy peggy sue
charlie i thought i knew everything about you
i wanted to apologize
i cant live without you
what about janet
i got tired of translating everything
she thought the big hopper was a hamburger
charlie laughs uncomfortably and peggy sue looks around her hospital room
who are all the flowers from
charlie pushes himself out of his chair and moves toward the dresser
maddie and arthur carol and walter
and heres a book by that guy from high school michael fitzsimmons
he dedicated it to you
charlie returns to peggys bedside and opens the front cover of the book
angle on book the front page bears the title the pilgrim soul and the dedication reads to peggy sue and a starry night
peggy smiles but shakes her head
it couldnt be me
i hardly knew him
ill just set it right here
he places the book on her bedside table as he sits back down
charlie i had a strange experience
i went back to high school
and i spent a lot of time with you
and you and walter and leon were singing i wonder why
oh god dion
you were terrific
and i kept trying to push you away but you wouldnt give up
ill never give up

he holds her hand
i loved you since the day i met you and i havent stopped
dont try to charm me charlie bodell
listen i dont expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away
but i would do what i can
charlie please i need some time
well ill let you get some rest
the view pulls back past the flowers
charlie starts to exit
checks himself in the mirror
charlie i would like to invite you to dinner at home on sunday with your kids
i will make a strudel
he hurries back to her kisses her again
they hang on to each other as beth enters the room
to be inserted after dolores peggy scene and to replace the goodbye to richard scene
empty except for richard who sits alone in a study warren surrounded by books
be puts down the book hes reading
you know peggy theres so many things to look forward to in the future
peggy leans over and kisses him sadly on the forehead
i came to say goodbye
