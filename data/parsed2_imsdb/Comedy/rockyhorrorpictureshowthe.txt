chorus cont to the late night double feature picture show
the song ends with church bells ringing joyously as the image expands to wide screen
the still frame bursts to life as the doors of the denton catholic church are flung open and mendelssohns wedding march resounds from the church organ
the young married couple ralph and betty hapschatt appear followed by a crowd of friends and well wishers throwing confetti and shouting excitedly
the minister shakes ralph by the hand while ralph slips him a bill
photographers take pictures
brad majors a young slightly awkward clean cut american in his mid twenties comes over the congratulate ralph
brad and ralph shake hands
well brad i guess we made it huh
well i dont think there was any doubt about that you and betty have been almost inseparable ever since you sat in on dr scotts refresher lectures
tell you the truth brad she was the only reason i came in the first place
science was never one of my favourite subjects but i sure with dr scott could have made it today
yes janet and i are both fond of him
we drove over to see him last vacation
its a shame his new job took him away from denton

the cross above spits optically
mahogany bookcases a large desk with a prominent globe of the world
a well padded armchair has its back to the camera
it swings around revealing the narrator
he is in his smoking jacket
he speaks directly to us
i would like if i may to take you on a strange journey
he crosses to the bookshelf
he selects a dossier
we see the title the denton affair
he returns to his desk and places it on a bookstand
he puts on his reading glasses
it seemed a fairly ordinary night when brad majors and his fiancee janet weiss two young ordinary healthy kids left denton that late november evening to visit dr everett scott
tutor and now friend of both of them
its true there were dark storm clouds heavy black and pendulous toward which they were driving
its true also that the spare tyre they were carrying was badly in need of some air
but they being normal kids and on a night out well they were not going to let a storm spoil the events of their evening
on a night out
he closes the book marking the place
thunder is heard distantly on the sound track
it was a night out they were going to remember for a very long time
lighting cracks on the sound track
a windscreen wiper working under strain
torrential rain on the windscreen
brad concentrating on visibility
janet eating chocolates and listening to the car radio playing an orson welles serial the shadow
a motorcycle roars past them
thats the third motorcyclist thats passed us
they certainly take their lives in their hands
what with the weather and all
lifes pretty cheap to that type
janet takes another stick of gum
offers brad some
the car slows to a halt
whats the matter brad darling
headlights on sign reading dead end
i think we took the wrong fork a few miles back
but then where did the motorcyclists come from
well i guess we will have to turn back
brad puts his foot on the accelerator
the wheel skids and explodes
what was that bang
we must have a blow out
pause a bolt of lighting strikes a tree
youd better sit here and keep warm while i go for help
but where will you go
were in the middle of nowhere
didnt we pass a castle back down the road a few miles
maybe they have a telephone i might use
he unbuckles his seatbelt
im coming with you
theres no point both of us getting wet
im coming with you
she unbuckles her seatbelt besides darling the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back
music commences and she alights from the car and follows him newspaper over her head
the rain pours off the newspaper down janets face
she walks along catching up with brad
she sing plaintively
in the velvet darkness of the blackest night burning bright
we see the two of them brad striding ahead janet nearly catching up with him
behind them on the side of the road sparse trees and rock formations
theres a guiding star no matter what or who you are
they have passed a row of trees
a rock formation in the shape of a castle is silhouetted against the sky
it has a flag flying from the turret
a glow of light appears in a window
it illuminates a path to the castle
brad and janet turn
the castle is in the distance between the two of them
theres a light the castle looms in the distance
over at the frankenstein place
brad stares hard
theres a light
the castle looms closer
burning in the fireplace
looks to brad theres a light a light in the darkness of everybodys life taking janet by the hand brad moves off the roadway towards the house
i can see the flag fly i can see the rain just the same there has got to be something better here for you and me
janet jumps towards brad
theres a light
the castle seems to move forward
burning in the fireplace
theres a light
a motorcycle convoy roars by revealing a hidden road to the castle
a light in the darkness of everybodys life
the convoy drives up and disappears into a secret entrance in the rock
we see a cell like window near a massive lighted window
a tortured face appears squinting into the darkness
the darkness must go down the river of nights dreaming flow morphia slow let the sun and light come streaming into my life
riff raff moves to the lighted window where his hunchbacked shape becomes a giant shadow
into my life
brad and janet start moving down the driveway
theres a light
shadow turns in the window
over at the frankenstein place
brad and janet approach the gateway to the castle
theres a light
the shadow slowly covers the whole window
burning in the fireplace
theres a light a light
brad and janet are at the gate
there is a rusted sign
in the darkness of everybodys life
a bolt of lighting illuminates the sign which reads frank n
furter the narrator is in his armchair
he leans forward with some urgency
and so it seemed that fortune had smiled on brad and janet and that they had found the assistance that their plight required or had they
brad rings the doorbell
it makes a strange sound
lets go back
im cold and im frightened
just a moment janet
they may have a telephone
the door opens
throbbing music is heard in the background as if there is a party going on in the distance
the figure we have seen at the window emerges
he is a hunch backed servant riff raff
uh oh hi
my name is brad majors
and this is my fiancee janet weiss
i ah wondered if you could help us
our car has broken down about two miles up the road
do you have a phone we might use
yes the rain has been very heavy
a bolt of lighting illuminates a row of vehicles parked by the castle
brad sees them and reacts with surprise
riff raff realises brad has seen them
i think you had better both come inside
youre too kind
they enter apprehensively
riff raff leads them down a stairway and beckons them to follow
the music has become louder
sotto voce oh brad im frightened
what kind of place is this
sotto voce oh its probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos
they arrive at a hallway at the bottom of the stairs
another servant magenta who bears a striking physical resemblance to riff raff is vacuuming the stairs
janet steps over the vacuum lead
are you giving a party
youve arrived on a rather special night
its one of the masters affairs
oh lucky him
brad and janet look at magenta surprised by her voice
youre lucky im lucky were all lucky
brad and janet are rather unnerved by this outburst from the domestic
they look back to riff raff
he is now standing by a set of mirrors reflecting to infinity
its astounding time is fleeting madness takes its toll but listen closely not for very much longer ive got to keep control
magenta gives riff raff a strange signal
riff raff starts to dance in an extraordinary fashion
i remember doing the time warp
brad and janet are amazed
drinking those moments when the blackness would hit me
magenta half closes her eyes in pleasure
janet clings to brad
and the void would be calling
riff raff opens a set of double doors marked ballroom
brad and janet find themselves on a balcony of a huge black and silver ballroom
at the furthest end is a throne like chair and surrounding it a theatre proscenium
in the body of the room are guests
they are the people brad and janet passed on the road
they are the transylvanian secret agents assembled on this special occasion from all over the earth
it is the annual transylvanian convention announced by an official banner suspended over the ballroom
they are all dressed in strange but elegant evening wear
they are a distorted version of the guests from the denton wedding
a party spirit prevails they throw their arms out in a plea to riff raff on the balcony
lets do the time warp again
janet falls into brads arms
riff raff is ecstatic
brad revives janet
repeating action lets do the time warp again
janet faints again
the narrator moves from his desk to the wall behind him
he pulls down a chart with illustrated dance steps on it
he gestures to the appropriate section of the diagram with the pointer
its just a jump to the left
the guests leap to the left in one giant step
dancing and a step to the right right right right right
narrator points to next step on the chart
with your hands on your hips
all guests have hands on hips
you bring your knees in tight
but its the pelvic thrust
the rows of guests open out with pelvic thrusts
guests cont they really drive you insane
we see them from the balcony and they open out in formation
guests cont lets do the time warp again
the guests re form
lets do the time warp again
brad and janet make a run out the door
they collide with magenta who has blocked off the corridor with her vacuum
she sings with menace waving the cleaner hose dangerously
its so dreamy oh fantasy free me so you cant see me no not at all
brad and janet look at each other in alarm
in another dimension
she forces them back towards balcony with voyeuristic intention
well secluded i see all with a bit of a mind flip youre into the time slip nothing will ever seem the same
they are back at the balcony
youre spaced out on sensation
they are at the edge of the balcony
like youre under sedation
they force brad and janet into the ballroom proper
the guests turn on them
lets do the time warp again
brad and janet are completely dismayed
lets do the time warp again
columbia a young girl is the household groupie
she sings with the band at the end of the ballroom
well i was walking down the street just having a think when a snake of a guy gave me an evil wink
well it shook me up it took me by surprise he had a pick up truck and the devils eyes he stared at me and i felt a change time
meant nothing never would again
lets do the time warp again
brad and janet are reeling
lets do the time warp again
he has now become rather involved in the dance and is standing on the blotter on the top of his desk
its just a jump to the left
he jumps to the left
and then a step to the right
the guests take one
the narrator dancing on the desk
with your hands on your hips
you bring your knees in tight
but its the pelvic thrust
low travelling shot between their legs
that really drives you insane
lets do the time warp again
everyone reverses direction
lets do the time warp again
all the guests fall to the floor like flies exhausted
do any of you guys know the madison
no one laughs
guests turn nasty
brad and janet retreat to the hall
behind them a lift slowly descends bearing a figure in a black cloak and a diamante stiletto heel beating time to a rhythm the band has started playing
brad please lets get out of here
for gods sake keep a grip on yourself janet
but it seems so unhealthy here
its just a
a party janet
well i want to leave
we cant go anywhere until i get to a phone
then ask the butler or someone
lets wait awhile janet
we dont want to interfere with their celebrations
this isnt the junior chamber of commerce brad
theyre probably foreigners with ways different from our own
they may do some more folk dancing
brad im cold im wet and plain scared
im here theres nothing to worry about
guests rise staring mesmerised at the lift
janet sees the shoe looks up at the face of its owner
the figure turns and throws open lift cage door
as camera zooms in to the death mask above them the film changes from black and white to colour
however the only colour in evidence is the red lipstick on the mouth of their host
how do you do
i see youve met my faithful handyman
hes a little brought down because when you knocked he thought you were the candyman
riff raff scowls
dont get strung out by the way that i look
frank strides across the ballroom to the throne
dont judge a book by its cover im not much of a man by the light of day but by night im one hell of a lover
janet gives a silent scream
frank lets the cloak fall onto the throne which reveals his transvestite attire
the guests scream with delight
im just a sweet transvestite from transexual transylvania
he slowly moves back to brad and janet doing leg kicks
let me show you around maybe play you a sound you look like youre both pretty groovie
he circles them and forces them into the ballroom
or if you want something visual not too abysmal we could take in an old steve reeves movie
brad clumsily attempts to circle around frank
frank meanwhile ignores him and greets his other guests
im glad we caught you at home ah could we use your phone were both in a bit of a hurry
janet joins brad
well just say where we are then go back to the car we dont want to be any worry
frank turns on them
you got caught with a flat well how about that well babies dont you panic by the light of the night itll seem alright ill get you a satanic mechanic
frank turns his back on brad and janet and splitting the ranks of his guests departs for the other end of the ballroom
im just a sweet transvestite from transexual transylvania
from the throne he gestures towards brad and janet rather slowly over the next verse
why dontcha stay for the night night or maybe a bite bite i could show you my favourite obsession ive been making a man with blonde hair and a tan
and hes good for relieving my tension
we view from overhead as the guests surround him adoringly
im just a sweet transvestite from transexual transylvania
frank storms down the ballroom to the lift
im just a sweet transvestite
sweet transvestite from transexual transylvania
transylvania so come up to the lab
frank cont and see whats on the slab
frank cont i see you shiver with anticipation frank cont but maybe the rain frank cont is really to blame frank cont so ill remove the cause but not the
symptom on the last chord the lift has disappeared
the guests applaud ecstatically
riff raff and magenta close in on brad and janet
they remove brad and janets wet clothes
columbia moves down from the bandstand and crosses to brad and janet
she witnesses the undressing
its too nice a job to rush
the guests moan softly as each piece of clothing is removed
brad and janet stand shivering in their underwear
there is complete silence
the guests and servants are motionless
brad and janet are the total object of their attention
confidentially its alright janet well play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right
he turns to columbia who has been staring at his underpants
my name is brad majors and this is my fiancee janet weiss
you are very lucky to be invited up to franks laboratory
some people would give their right arm for the privilege
riff raff has opened the cage doors to the lift
the guests rush for positions
people like you maybe ive seen it
columbia escorts them to the lift
riff raff throws two guests to the floor to make room for them
he slams the cage door
the two discarded guests cry and claw at the cage door as the lift moves off under riff raffs control
brad and janet are squashed arms by their side
they stare straight ahead
to magenta it he frank is he your husband
the master is not yet married
nor do i think he ever will be
we are simply his servants
the lift grinds to a halt
they have arrived at the laboratory
the laboratory is somewhere between a student observation operating theatre and a greek gymnasium
it is pink tiled throughout facing the lift entrance is a circular area containing a tank on pedestals which though screened at this stage will be revealed to contain the
body of rocky submerged in chemicals the wall to one side contains a raised dias area for the guests and facing one end of the tank the operational controls monitor and a giant refrigerator
a chandelier hangs above the tank
on the podium in front of franks chambers there is a stand microphone
near the podium are some weights
behind the tank is a vaulting horse
these are wrapped in sellophane rockys presents
the guests are waiting as the lift arrives
frank now in surgeons outfit stands in the middle of the room
riff raff gets out of the lift first with a glass of champagne which he hands to frank
magenta columbia go and assist riff raff
as he speaks her name each one steps forward out of the lift
they cross to riff raff behind the tank
i will entertain
brad janet step out of the lift
im brad majors and this is my fiancee janet vice
frank taking janets hand to kiss encante
he circles them and what charming underclothes you both have
he takes two dust coats from riff raff and hands them to brad
but here put these on
theyll make you feel less vulnerable
magenta columbia cross to the podium
frank continues its not often we receive visitors here
let alone offer them hospitality
brad moving towards frank hospitality
all we wanted to do was use your telephone
a reasonable request which you have chosen to ignore
janet hurring after brad dont be ungrateful brad
brad stepping closer to frank ungrateful
the room falls silent
all eyes are on frank waiting for his reaction
a smile breaks on his face
how forceful you are brad
such a perfect specimen of manhood
magenta columbia laugh
you must be awfully proud of him janet
well yes i am
the guests oh and ah appreciatively brad laughs a little embarassed
do you have any tattoos brad
how about you
he laughs riff raff has approached behind frank looming over his shoulder
everything is in readiness master
we merely await your word
frank drinks his champagne then hands riff raff the empty glass
riff raff goes to the control panel and frank to the podium tonight
one one one
can you hear me at the back
tonight my unconventional conventionists
magenta columbia and guests laugh politely
tonight you are to witness a breakthrough in biochemical research
there is a gasp from columbia magenta and guests
and paradise is to be mine
guests and everybody applaud
janet claps too but brad indicates that she shouldnt
it was strange the way it happened
one of those quirks of fate really
one of those moments when you seem irredeemably lost you panic youre trapped your backs against the wall
theres no way out and then suddenly you get a break
he cracks the bones in his hand all the pieces seem to fit into place
what a sucker your been
what a fool
the answer was there all the time
it took a small accident to make it happen
magenta columbia step forward one each side of him
magenta columbia softly an accident
thats how i discovered the secret
that elusive ingredient that spark that is the breath of life
frank moving to tank you see brad and janet you are fortunate
for tonight is the night that my beautiful creature is destined to be born
frank then pulls the cover from the tank
riff raff is at the control panel
the tank is revealed
there is something inside it is immersed in clear fluid
the guests are astonished
throw open the switches on the sonic oscillator
riff raff flicks the switch to activate the oscilloscopes in the panel
and step up the reactor power input three more points
riff raff presses a button three times then begins to unwind a wheel
frank watches excitedly from behind the tank as the chandelier is lowered
it spurts different coloured liquids into the tank
the liquids bubble and change colour
the thing inside begins to look like a human form
its alright janet
the liquids drain away
the form begins to move
frank climbs the ladder at one end of the tank riff raff the other
rocky horror sits up raises his arms finally stands upright with both arms outstretched
riff raff removes the bandage from rockys head
rocky looks at riff raff then at frank
with a gasp he leaps for the chandelier above
at the same time riff raff is down the ladder making for the handle
he winds up the chandelier and rocky
rocky horror with only his head unbandaged is hanging on to the chandelier which riff raff is winding upwards
the sword of damocles is hanging over my head
frank runs down the ladder and kicks riff raff who starts to lower the chandelier
frank climbs up the other steps to meet his creation coming down
magenta columbia cross to the tank
and ive got the feeling someones going to be cutting the thread
oh woe is me
my life is a misery
oh cant you see that im at the start of a pretty big downer
as rocky gets level with him frank lunges for him but lands inside the tank
rocky simultaneously abandons the chandelier lands between magenta and columbia who now each have a pair of scissors with which they will snip his arm and leg bandages
i woke up this morning with a start when i fell out of bed
riff magenta columbia that aint no crime
and left from my dreaming was a feeling of un nameable dread
that aint no crime my high is low
im dressed up with no place to go
and all i know is im at the start of a pretty big downer
frank in the tank behind rocky puts his arms round rockys neck
rocky spins away
magenta and columbia hang on to one end of his chest bandage so that it undoes as he goes
riff raff magenta columbia sha la la la that aint no crime
oh no no no no
sha la la la that aint no crime
no no no no no
sha la la la that aint no crime that aint no crime
rocky is now unbandaged
he strikes a pose
during the last sequence frank climbs out of the tank onto riff raffs shoulders and purses rocky but they fall
narrator reading from book
rocky needed peace of mind
he didnt know he was doing just fine
he was the product of another time
and as for feeling down well thats not a crime
frank and riff raff are recovering from their fall
rocky makes a circuit of the guests
guests riff magenta columbia that aint no crime
rocky to first group of guests the sword of damocles is hanging over my head
that aint no crime
rocky to second group and ive got the feeling someones going to be cutting the thread
that aint no crime
rocky to third group oh woe is me my life is a mystery
to fourth group oh cant you see that im at the start of a pretty big downer
rocky set off at a run as frank looms up again
frank is chasing rocky round the lab
sha la la la that aint no crime
oh no no no no
sha la la la that aint no crime
no no no no
sha la la la that aint no crime
that aint no crime
sha la la la that aint no crime
no no no no
sha la la la that aint no crime
no no no no
sha la la la that aint no crime that aint no crime
at the end of number rocky has climbed up the ladder attached to the end of the tank nearest the bridal chambers and frank is in a heap below
riff raff is behind the tank and magenta and columbia in their positions in front of it
frank picks himself up
rocky is sitting at the top of the ladder above him with his perfect limbs near franks face
thats no way to behave on your first day out
rocky looks hurt
but as youre such an exceptional beauty im prepared to forgive
frank crosses behind rocky to stand next to riff raff behind the tank
i just love success
riff raff edging up to frank he is a credit to your genius master
magenta moving to tank from controls a triumph of your vill
columbia who is on opposite side of tank hes o
moving out behind tank towards janet and brad i think we can do a little better than that
to janet what do you think
she looks at brad i dont like men with
er with too many muscles
i didnt make him for you janet nods hastily
frank moves towards microphone
he carries the charles atlas seal of approval
and he didnt even take the lessons
song charles atlas pt
as frank starts to sing magenta riff raff collect one of rockys presents the vaulting horse and place it in front of the podium
columbia leads rocky down from the ladder
a weakling weighing ninety eight pounds will get sand in his face when kicked to the ground
and soon in the gym rocky sits on horse with a determined chin the sweat from his pores as he works for his ca ha hause magenta riff raff now
bring the weights
will make him glisten thank you and gleam
and with massage and just a little bit of ste he he he hem
laughs hell be pink
and quite clean
hell be a strong man oh honey but the wrong man
hell eat nutritious high protein and swallow raw eggs
try to build up his shoulders his chest arms and legs
such an effort if he only knew of my plan
in just seven days i can make you a ma aa a a an rocky throws down the weights and begins press ups
hell do press ups and chin ups do the snatch clean and jerk
frank crosses to janet brad he thinks dynamic tension must be hard work
such strenuous living i just dont understand
frank moves back to rocky who is still pressing up
when in just seven days oh baby
rocky jumps up
i can make you a ma a a a an
the large refrigeration unit door slowly opens falling like a drawbridge
inside is a wall of ice and many cocacola bottles
through these bursts an icy eddie riding a harley davidson motor bike ex world war ii holding a gibson guitar
several guests are crushed to death
stay cool baby
the delivery boy
his delivery wasnt good enough though
rocky looks terrified
janet has fainted yet again
eddie comes to life
whatever happened to saturday night when you dressed up sharp and you felt alright it dont seem the same since cosmic light came into my life and i thought i
columbia leaps on to the pillion seat
i used to go for a ride with a chick whod go and listen to the music on the radio
the motorcyclists guests remember only too well
a saxophone was blowing on a rock and roll show and we climbed in the back and we really had a good time columbia rushes to the switchboard flicks a
lighting switch and all the lights above the stairs start changing colour
the guests go crazy and rock and roll all over the staircase
columbia dances with eddie
even riff raff and magenta step it out
hot patootie bless my soul i really love that rock and roll four times eddie more confident less frozen leaps onto the motorbike in a legs apart guitar strumming pose
frank is getting furious
rocky is perplexed
my head used to swim from the perfume i smelled
my hands kind of fumbled with her white plastic belt
id taster her baby pink lipstick and thats when id melt
and shed whisper in my ear tonight she really was mine
get back in front and put some hair oil on
buddy holly was singing his very last song
with your arms around your girl you tried to ah sing along it felt pretty good whoo

eddie slips onto the pedal starting the bike
he takes off and roars round the laboratory even riding up and down the walls

on the last chorus frank rushes to eddie with the ice pick in a demented fury
the guests are unbelieving
columbia covers her face with her hands
eddie is dead
frank walks away from his body unconcerned
janet screams and screams
magenta is very bored and picking up ice cubes and placing them in the ice bucket
one from the vaults
riff raff drags eddies dismembered body back into the fridge
and so perish all those who reject my love
rocky cowers in terror
oh no my little adonis youre much too beautiful to be destroyed
he had a certain naive charm but no muscle
frank is thrilled
but a deltoid and a bicep a hot groin and a tricep makes me ooh shake
makes me want to take charles atlas by the ha and
in just seven days oh baby i can make you a ma ha ha ha haan
i dont want no dissension just dynamic tension
in just seven days i can make you a ma ha ha ha haan
in just seven days i can make you a ma ha ha ha haaan
riff raff presses a button and a wall opens revealing a bridal suite done out in black silk
the guests shout their approval
the end of the song turns into mendelssohns wedding march and frank leads rocky to his bridal chamber
the guests throw confetti
brad and janet look at each other in amazement
there are some people who say that life is an illusion and that reality is simply a figment of our imaginations
if this is so then brad and janet are quite safe
however the sudden departure of their host and his creation into the seclusion of his sombre bridal suite had left them feeling both apprehensive and uneasy
a feeling which grew as the other guests departed and they were shown to their separate rooms
janet looks lost
she sits on the end of the bed
brad looks lost
he examines the tv monitor
riff raff and magenta by the monitor
they switch from channel to channel
we see brad looking at the tv monitor
and janet sitting on the end of the bed
janet lies back on the bed and switches off her bedside lamp
riff raff and magenta smile at each other
only a soft glow of moonlight from a barred window
on the netting round her bed
there is a knock at the door
janet sits p
who is it
brads voice from behind the door
its only me janet
oh brad come in darling
a silhouette enters and crosses to the bed
it moves onto the bed behind the net curtain
oh brad mmmm oh yes my darling what if
its alright janet
everythings going to be alright
oh i hope so my darling
but let me switch on the light
no dont do that
oh dont be so shy
she switches on the light to reveal frank
frank sits up
im afraid so janet
but isnt it nice
janet beats his chest with her clenched fists
you beast you monster what have you done with brad
why do you think i should
you tricked me i wouldnt have ive never never i know
but it wasnt all bad was it
in fact i think you found it quite pleasurable
mmmmm so soft so sensual
he re commences making love to her
oh oh no stop i mean help

she shouts brad
frank places a finger on her lips
brads probably asleep by now
do you want him to see you like this
like this like how
its your fault
youre to blame
pause i was saving myself
well im sure youre not spent yet
he switches off the light
riff raff and magenta stare intently at the screen
they smile at each other
silhouette of frank and janet making love
promise you wont tell brad
cross my heart and hope to die
janet squeals with excitement
we see rocky chained to the bed sleeping
in the background riff raff and magenta in laboratory
rocky stirs and makes a sound
riff raff walks across to the door and stares at the sleeping body
his eyes are full of hate
he looks at magenta
she nods to him
he releases the chains
riff raff picks up a candelabra from the bedside table and taunts rocky
rocky jumps out of the bed terrified
riff raff pushes the candelabra in his face
rocky crashes through the laboratory and escapes
riff raff turns to magenta who is now standing in the doorway
riff raff puts down the candelabra and they exchange a strange sign
a knock at the door
brad opens it cautiously
a shadowy figure moves across the room to the bed
distraught oh brad its no good here
it will destroy us
brad takes her hand
dont worry janet well be away from here in the morning
hmmmm you smell so good
he gently lays her down on the bed and attempts to caress her
not till after the wedding darling
brad sits up
the shadow rolls over
maybe we could try it this way
yes its alright
everythings going to be alright
i hope so my darling
brad reaches out to the light
no dont put on the l
brad switches on the bedside lamp an realises he is making love to frank wearing a janet wig
im afraid so brad
but wasnt it nice
brad grabs frank around the throat
why you what have you done with janet
why do you think i should
brad lets him go and turns away humiliated
you tricked me
i wouldnt have ive never never
i know but it wasnt all bad was it
i think you found it quite pleasurable
he caresses brad oh so soft
ahhh no stop i mean janet
janets probably asleep by now
do you want her to see you like this
throwing frank aside like how
its your fault youre to blame
i thought it was the real thing
oh come on brad admit it
it was enjoyable wasnt it
theres no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure
frank switches off light oh brad you have wasted so much time already
janet neednt know i wont tell her
you promise you wont tell
on my mothers grave
suddenly the shadows are illuminated by the monitor as an image of riff raff appears on the screen above the bed
master rocky has broken his chains and vanished
the new playmate is loose and in the castle ground
magenta has just released the dogs
frank is getting carried away
a shot of pack of huge alsations careereing around the castle grounds
they are chasing a bewildered rocky
janet is lying on the bed posed in the style of a true romance comic heroine
whats happening here
brad is posed in the style of a true romance comic hero
he is nervous and smoking
behind him frank is asleep on the bed
once in a while she dont want to call you speaking on the telephone once in your life she wont want to know you you look around the one youve
found she is gone
janet is sitting on the end of the bed
im engaged to brad just the same as betty monroe was to ralph hapschatt
but franks kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy ive never dreamt of before
hot burning kisses
and thats all the time that it takes for a heart to turn to stone the sweeter the wine the harder to make the break you hear something about someone
youd thought youd known
janet is at the door
i could see brads face before me and my mind screamed no
but my lips were hungry too hungry
so baby dont cry like theres no tomorrow after the night theres a brand new day
and therell be no pain and no more sorrow
so wash your face and phone my place itll be o
i wanted to be loved completely
my body throbbed excitedly
oh brad brad my darling how could i have done this to you
and thats all the time that it takes for a heart to beat again
so give me a sign that a lover makes you look around the one youve found is back again
if only we hadnt made this journey
if only the car hadnt broken down
if only we were amongst friends or sane persons
the narrator is leaning back in his armchair cool and considerate
if and only two small words
words which kept repeating themselves again and again in janets thoughts
but it was too late to go back now
it was as if she were riding a giant tidal wave
it would be folly to fight against it
her only chance would be to ride it out adapt and perhaps also to survive
janet is pacing around the tank which is covered by a cloth
she becomes aware of the sound of someone crying inside
she pulls the cloth back to reveal rocky lying in the tank exhausted and bleeding
rocky horror looks miserable
there you see its instinctive
this room is your womb
you returned here for one thing security
janet crosses to the tv monitor
what have they done with him
she switches on the monitor
she changes the channels on the monitor getting various empty rooms in the castle
occasional shot of alsatian dogs
till finally she switches into brads bedroom and sees brad sitting on the end of the bed and frank lying asleep on the bed
rocky smiles helplessly
janet moves away from the monitor and back to rocky
how could you
she sees rockys wounds oh but youre hurt
did they do this to you
here lie down
ill dress your wounds
rocky smiles at janet
a new expression crosses her face
reads from a dictionary emotion
mental agitation an excited state of
he looks up it is also an irrational and powerful master and from what janet had witnessed on the monitor there seemed to be little doubt that she was indeed
columbia and magenta are watching the monitor
tell us about it janet
rocky is lying on the operating table
janet is dabbing his wounds
i was feeling done in couldnt win id only ever kissed before columbia and magenta
to magenta you mean she only ever kissed
janet rips off a piece of her petticoat for a bandage
i thought theres no use getting into heavy petting
she rips off another piece of her petticoat
it only leads to trouble and seat wetting
janet rips another piece off her fast vanishing petticoat
during the next verse she bandages rocky
now all i want to know is how to go ive tasted blood and i want more ill put up no resistance i want to stay the distance ive got
an itch to scratch and i need assistance
janet grabs rockys hands and places them on her
touch a touch a touch a touch me
i wanna be dirty
thrill me chill me fulfil me
creature of the night
then if anything grows she laughs while you pose ill oil you up and rub you down down down down
and thats just one small fraction of the main attraction you need a friendly hand
oh and i need action
touch a touch a touch a touch me
i wanna be dirty
thrill me chil me fulfil me
creature of the night
columbia magenta are watching the tv relay of rocky janet
they are amused by janets inexperience parodying her as they sing
touch a touch a touch a touch me
i wanna be dirty
thrill me chill me fulfil me
creature of the night
oh touch a touch a touch a touch me
i wanna be dirty
thrill me chill me fulfil me oh creature of the night
creature of the ni i ight
we see janets p
of all the characters singing the last line creature of the night
creature of the night
creature of the night
creature of the night
creature of the night
creature of the night
creature of the night
creature of the night
columbia magentas reactions
janet rocky in each others arms hear another scream in the distance
frank is chasing riff raff with a whip
brad is following
riff raff rushes into the lift and presses the button desperately but frank follows him and so does brad
we see the lift descending
riff raff slides across the laboratory floor escaping franks whip
how did it happen
i understood you were to be watching
riff raff gets to his feet keeping a careful eye on the whip hand
i was only away for a minute master
well see if you can find him on the monitor
riff raff switches channels on the monitor
an image of a middle aged professorial man in a wheelchair appears
the man is outside the castle peering around the trees stealthily
master we have a visitor
frank and brad crowd around the monitor
great scott scotty dr everett scott
you know this earth this person
i most certainly do
he happens to be an old friend of mine
so this wasnt simply a chance meeting
you came here with a purpose
i told you my car broke down
on the monitor the stranger looks very shifty
frank looks brad hard in the eye
i was telling the truth
i know what you told me brad
but this dr everett scott
his name is not unknown to me
he was a science teacher at denton high
and now he works for your government doesnt he brad
hes attached to the bureau of investigation of that which you call u
isnt he brad
he might be
i dont know
hell be in the zen room
dr scott is indeed in the zen room
well lets ask him
frank throws a switch marked triple contact electro magnet
we see dr scotts wheelchair screaming through corridors rooms and doors and ends up clamped to the electro magnet in the laboratory
brad is amazed
dr everett scott is even more amazed
what are you doing here
frank releases the electro magnet
the wheelchair hits the floor
dont play games dr scott
you know very well what brad majorss doing here
it was part of your plan was it not that he and his female should check the layout for you
well unfortunately for you all theres to be a change of plans
im sure youre adaptable dr scott
i know brad is
brad looks embarrassed and humiliated
i can assure you that brads presence comes as a complete surprise to me
i came to find eddie
ive seen him
frank cuts in quickly
what do you know of eddie dr scott
i happen to know a great deal about a lot of things
you see eddie happens to be my nephew
a stifled gasp is heard from janet behind the curtain
frank is surprised
frank crosses the screen and pulls back the curtain to reveal janet and rocky
rocky reviles frank with a look
he puts his arm around janet
frank is appalled
i made you and i can break you just as easily
rocky is terrified
he takes his arm away from janet
a gong is heard
magenta comes through the broken tiles
master dinner is prepared
frank riff raff exchange a look
moves to dr
scott doctor scott you can sample the speciality of the house roast loin of pork
he gives janet who is virtually naked a seering look
under the circumstances formal dress is to be optional
frank leads the way to the lift
food has always played a vital role in lifes rituals
the breaking of bread the last meal of the condemned man and now this meal
however informal it might appear you can be sure there was to be very little bonhomie
at the head of a large coffin shaped table sits frank
there is an electric carver on the table in front of him
the table is laid for dinner and present are janet brad on franks right dr
scott opposite him rocky horror on dr
scotts right and between rocky and frank columbia
they sit in silence as the double doors open
riff raff and magenta enter
riff raff carries a large joint of meat magenta the wine both of which they set down at the head of the table
riff raff magenta pour out the wine and return to the side of front who then rises
a toast to absent friends
frank now proceeds to carve the meat
everyone is quiet and only the buzzing of the electric carver is heard
riff raff magenta distribute the slices then return to their places
we came here to discuss eddie
frank silencing her with a gesture its a rather tender subject
another slice anyone
everybody looks at their food carefully
she rushes from from the room with a ghastly cry
scott turning aside i knew he was in with a bad crowd
but it was worse than i imagined
he turns back aliens
brad janet look at each other then at dr
go on dr
scott or should i say doctor von scott
what exactly are you implying
frank threatens him with the knife
thats alright brad
but doctor scott
scott silences brad with a gesture
scott picks up some meat on a fork and regards it
from the day he was born he was trouble
he was the thorn in his mutters side
she tried in vain
but he never caused her nothing but shame
scott produces scrapbook opening it at a picture of eddies mother
he left home the day she died
from the day she was gone all he wanted dr
scott turns page to a picture of a record of elvis singing teddy bear
was rock and roll he turns the page to porno
he turns page to show an advertisement for harley davidson
und a motorbike
he turns to a still of eddie as an addict shooting up junk he turns to reveal a newspaper clipping thug bashes woman
he was a low down cheap little punk
turns the page to eddies mug shot
taking everyone for a ride
the page turns again revealing the lyrics
when eddie said he didnt like his teddy you knew he was a no good kid
but when he threatened your life with a switch blade knife what a guy makes you cry und i did
she has a large portrait of eddie on the wall
she is lighting the candles on her dressing table
everybody shoved him i very nearly loved him
i said hey listen to me stay sane inside insanity
but he locked the door and threw away the key
she collapses in tears
making him warn me in a note dr
scott produces the note
whats it say whats it say
im out of my head oh hurry or i may be dead
they mustnt carry out their evil deeds yaaaow
scotts hands tremble with the note
janet brad are now standing one each side of him
when eddie said he didnt like his teddy you knew he was a no good kid
und when he threatened your life with a switch blade knife what guy makes you cry und i did
teddy as dr
scott produces it
when eddie said he didnt like his teddy you knew he was a no good kid
but when he threatened your life with a switch blade knife what a guy woe woe woe makes you cry hey hey hey und i did frank suddenly pulls away
the tablecloth to reveal a glass coffin containing the decomposed remains of eddie
riff raff magenta laugh
janet screams and runs to rocky who hugs her
brad looks shocked
scott wheels back his wheelchair in disgust frank moves d
oh rocky how could you
janet runs out frank in pursuit
rocky smiles wanly
encouraged by this frank smashes janet across the face with the back of his hand
ill tell you once wont tell you twice youd better wise up janet weiss
yapple pie dont taste too nice youd better wise up janet weiss
she runs out of room
janet runs down corridor frank following her
ive laid the seed it should be all you need
brad appears pushing dr scott in hot pursuit
youre as sensual as a pencil wound up like an e or first string janet arrives at door of laboratory she cant open it
frank arrives face to face
when we made it did ya hear a bell ring
the door opens they fall through
the door slams in dr scotts face
janet rushes in down the ramp with frank in pursuit
ygot a block take my advice
youd better wise up janet weiss
scott brad arrive in the lift
frank has circled the tank and arrived at the control panel
the transducer he slams the handle will seduce yah
scott brad janet find they are stuck to the floor
my feet i can move my feet
my wheels my god i cant move my wheels
its as if we were glued to the spot
you are so quake with fear you tiny fools
frank moving to her its something youll get used to
a mental mind fuck can be nice
frank climbs up the ladder beside the tank
music under this dialogue you wont find earth people quite the easy mark you imagine
this sonic transducer it is i suppose some kind of audio vibratory physiomolecular transport device
its something we ourselves have been working on
but it seems our friend here has found a way of perfecting it
a device which is capable of breaking down solid matter and then projecting it through space and who knows perhaps even time itself
you mean hes gonna send us to another planet
frank leaps off the tank to the floor
frank circles janet testing her thighs
brad struggles in vain
youd better wise up janet weiss
youd better wise up build your thighs up
youd better wise up
then she cries out janet screams out
sto o o o o op
she cried so loudly that frank staggers backwards towards the control panel
riff raff magenta enter through the hole in the tiles they march to behind the tank and then the control panel
frank singing dont get hot and flustered use a bit of mustard
youre a hot dog but youd better not try to hurt her frank furter
frank signals to magenta
bcs magentas hand on the transducer switch
brad is turned into a statute
youre a hot dog but youd better not try to hurt her frank furter
frank signals cut to the switch as it is turned on
scott is a statue
youre a hot dog
janet is stone
i cant take any more of this first you spurn me for eddie then you cast him off like an old overcoat for rocky
you chew people up and then spit them out i loved you do you hear me i loved you and what did it get me ill tell you a big
youre like a sponge
you take take take take
you drain others of their love and emotions
well ive had enough
youve got to choose between me and rocky so named because of the rocks in his head
frank throws a switch she turns to stone
its not easy having a good time
he crosses over to riff raff and magenta even smiling makes my face ache
riff raff and magenta nod sympathetically
he lies on the operating table
my children turn on me
rockys behaving just as eddie did
maybe i made a mistake in splitting his brain between the two of them
massaging his temples when will we return to transylvania
i grow weary of this world
magenta i am indeed grateful to both you and your brother riff raff you have both served me well loyalty such as yours must be rewarded and you will discover
when the mood takes me i can be quite generous
magenta betrays her resentment by digging her fingernails into his neck
i ask for nothing master
frank leaps up from the table
and you shall receive it in abundance
he goes to the lift come
we are ready for the floor show
he slams the lift gate our guests will be growing restless
the lift moves downwards
left alone in the laboratory magenta and riff raff smile at each other
they make a special sign and leave by a secret passageway
and so by some extraordinary coincidence fate it seems had decided that brad and janet should keep that appointment with their friend dr everett scott
but it was to be in a situation which none of them could have possibly foreseen
and just a few hours after announcing their engagement brad and janet had both tasted forbidden fruit
this in itself was proof that their host was a man of little morals and some persuasion
what further indignities were they to be subjected to
and what of the sonic transducer and floor show that had been spoken of
from what had gone before it was clear that this was to be no picnic
ballroom including stage night we see the stage at the end of the ballroom with red velvet curtains
frank is enjoying dressing the statues which are now on stage
each one is lovingly fitted with extravagant variations on the stocking and suspender belt variety of his own fantasies
footlights glowing on the curtains
frank pulls a switch and the curtains open
red velvet curtains open to reveal statues in front of silver drapes
the floor is covered with a light mist
frank beams and pulls lever
columbias statue comes to life
it was great when it all began i was a regular frank fan
but it was over when he had the plan to start working on a muscle man
now the only thing that gives me hope is my love of a certain dope rose tints my world keeps me safe from my trouble and pain
rocky leaps to life
im just seven hours old truly beautiful to behold and somebody should be told my libido hasnt been controlled now the only thing ive come to trust is an orgasmicerush
of lust rose tints my world keeps me safe from my trouble and pain
brad animated by frank its beyond me help me mommy ill be good youll see take this dream away whats this lets see i feel sexy whats come over me
here it comes again
she behaves like a sex goddess completely out of control as if performing in a burlesque show
i feel released bad times deceased my confidence increased reality is here the game has been disbanded my mind has been expanded its a gas that frankies landed his lust
is so sincere
we pull back on the whole stage
the velvets open to reveal the th century fox logo as a stage set
at the top of the staircase frank appears bathed in light
he wears a dazzling version of the national costume and a chiffon cloak which billows in the breeze from a wind machine
he is reminiscent of a s film star
what ever happened to fay wray that delicate satin draped frame as it clung to her thigh how i started to cry for i wanted to be dressed just the
the floor opens to reveal a swimming pool glistening with chlorine and glitter
he beckons the guests
in their drugged state they comply with his every wish
give yourself over to absolutely pleasure swim the warm waters of sins of the flesh erotic nightmares beyond any measure and sensual daydreams to treasure forever
frank enters the pool
cant you just see it
cant you just see it
they begin to immerse themselves in the pool
a dont dream it
dont dream it
dr scott animates belatedly
he observes the orgy occurring in the pool
ach weve got to get out of this trap before this decadence saps our wills
ive got to be strong and try to hang on
or else my mind may well snap
the wind machine blows the blanked from his lap and we see legs stockings and a suspender belt
as in a miracle he can walk again
und my life will be lived for the thri i i i ill
brad surfaces his face betraying consternation
its beyond me help me mo ommy
he is pulled back into the pool
a thrilled janet now emerges
god bless lilly saint cyr
frank breaks through the water on a lift from rocky
my my my my im a wild and an untamed thing
im a bee with a deadly sting
get a hit and your mind goes ping
your heartll thump and your blood will sing
so let the party and the sounds rock on
gonna shake it till the life has gone
rose tint my world keep me safe from my trouble and pain
frank dives into the pool
during the chorus the whole group are diving in and out of the pool in a frenetic water ballet
im a wild and an untamed thing im a bee with a deadly sting
get a hit and your mind goes ping your heartll thump and your blood will sing
they emerge from the pool and form a kick line
so let the part and the sounds rock on gonna shake it till the life has gone
rose tint my world keep me safe from my trouble and pain
the doors at the opposite end of the ballroom open
riff raff and magenta now dressed in military style space suits face frank from the opposite end of the ballroom
they applaud slowly
riff raff has a ray gun
the characters on stage freeze terrified
its a showdown across the ballroom
furter its all over your mission is a failure
frank looks stunned
your life styles too extreme
frank is guilt stricken
im your new commander
you are now my prisoner
the guests scramble for the safety of the wings
we return to transylvania he turns to magenta prepare the transit beam
magenta turns to leave
i can explain
frank moves slowly to centre stage
during the song he adjusts footlight controls to give him what effects he requires
the others help frank out by singing from the wings
columbia operates a spotlight
brad closes silver curtains
on the day i went away
goodbye was all i had to say now i want to come again and stay oh my my smile and that will mean i may he kicks on cloud projection
blue skies appear
ive seen blue skies through the tears in my eyes and i realise im going home im going home frank falls on his knees
everywhere its been the same feeling like im outside in the rain wheeling free to try and find a game dealing cards for sorrow cards for pain
dr scott switches on wind machine
ive seen blue skies through the tears in my eyes and i realise im going home im going home
im going home
magenta who during all this has been filing her nails looks up at frank who is in an attitude of supplication
riff raff moves slowly to the stage
and also presumptuous of you
you see when i said we were to return to transylvania i referred only to magenta and myself
frank looks appalled
the guests are deeply troubled realising that they also are not part of the we
you see you are to remain here in spirit anyway
he produces a ray gun
great heavens thats a laser
yes dr scott
a laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti matter
you mean youre going to kill him
whats his crime
you saw what became of eddie
society must be protected
exactly dr scott
now frank n
furter your time has come
say goodbye to all this and hello to oblivion
frank raises himself to his full height
do your worse inferior one
as riff raff pulls the trigger columbia dashes between them
she is killed instantly
riff raff fires again at frank
frank takes a leap fro the rope on the curtain
the entire proscenium crashes under the weight
and frank is crushed to death among the velvet and glittered facia
rocky breaks down completely
although he despised frank he was all he had in the world
he rushes to the body and cradles it in his arms
riff raff can stand no more
he fires a blast of laser beam at rocky who starts climbing the stairway towards the fox skyline
riff raff fires again and again
with the body of frank in his arms rocky beats on his chest and lets out a wild sound like a giant beast of the jungle
riff raff fires a sustained beam
rocky climbs to the top of the fox sculpture
riff raff fires again and again
they crash to their deaths
youve killed them
magenta has found the entire sequence of events quite distasteful
i thought you liked them
they liked you
they didnt like me
they never liked me
he tries a calming hand you did right
a decision had to be made
the big sell out youre ok by me
dr scott im sorry about your nephew
yes well perhaps it was for the best
you must leave now dr scott while its still possible
we are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of transylvania
the guests flee down the ballroom and out the door
we see the laughing figures of riff raff and magenta making a special sign to each other
we see brad and janet fleeing with dr scott following behind
riff raff and magentas laughter has subsided
our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister soon we will return to the moon drenched shores of our androgenous planet
ah sweet transexual land of night to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains
to take that step to the right
but its the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane
and our world will do the time warp again
there is a huge explosion
we see the entire castle surrounded by a giant beam of light and then vanish into space
during the explosion sequence the film reverts optically to black and white
brad janet and dr scotts bodies are scattered on three sides surrounding a crater where the castle once was
the scene is arid and deserted
there are remnants of dr scotts wheelchair eddies coffin and broken objects from the laboratory
brad tattered and bleeding lifts himself up
ive done a lot god knows ive tried to find the truth ive even lied but all i know is down inside
dr scott drags himself to his knees
revives and super heroes come to feast to taste the flesh not yet deceased and al i know is still the beast is feeding
the three of them stand shakily on the perimeter of the crater
all that is left is dust and sand and wind and the sun
the camera pans from face to face in a circular movement getting faster and faster as the trio sing a chorale of hopelessness
the camera has spun into a blur but focusses on a spinning globe of the earth on the narrators desk
the narrator puts his hand on the globe stopping it
he is standing over his lectern reading from his book like a preacher in a pulpit
and crawling on the planets face some insects called the human race lost in time and lost in space and meaning
he turns and goes to the door of the study
he switches off the light
he leaves the study shutting the door
its almost dark in the study
only a sinister glow inside the globe of the earth remains
the cast credits roll up
science fiction double feature frank has built and lost his creature darkness has conquered brad and janet the servants gone to a distant planet oh at the late night double
feature picture show i want to go ohh to the late night double feature picture show

all entrances to the lab will be via the broken tiled entrance
delete all references to the floor lowering
the secret passage is now the broken tile entrance
frank tries to scale up the silver drapes which descend on him with tab tracks rope supports etc
n as scripted up to what further indignities were they to be subjected to
then please add and what of the floor show that had been spoken of
in an empty house
in the middle of the night
what diabolical plan had seized franks crazed imagination
from what had gone before it was clear that this was to be no picnic
is replaced by the following emotion is a powerful and irrational master and from what magenta and columbia eagerly viewed on their television monitor there seemed little doubt that janet
was indeed its slave
oh no my baby dont be upset it was a mercy killing
he had a certain naive charm but no muscle
