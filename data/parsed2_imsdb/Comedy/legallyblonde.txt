karen mccullah lutz kirsten smith shooting draft july head over heels by the go gos plays as we wind through a flock of abstract silky golden strands pulling back to
discover that the strands are hair on a blonde girls head
but not just any blonde girl a girl in delta gamma the blondest most beautiful sorority at usc
we pull back further to see that shes signing a handmade card
she holds it up over her shoulder we see hearts and glitter surrounding and good luck tonight
and elle and warner forever
she carries the card out of her room and we follow her across the hall into the room of three blonde cheerleaders who stop practicing their pom pom routine to
sign the card
as they finish we follow the card girl out and into the room of a blonde girl in a tank top and shorts working out on a stairmaster as general
hospital plays on a tiny tv
she signs the card while continuing to exercise
we move on to the room of a blonde girl making out with her boyfriend who stops long enough to sign the card as her boyfriend nibbles on her neck
she hands the card back and we head into the room of a blonde party girl who pours a pink frozen margarita into a glass from the blender then passes
it down to another blonde girl assembly line style
the card goes one way being signed as the drinks go the other
once the card arrives back in the card girls hands we follow her out of the room and down the hall until she reaches the very last and biggest door
she puts a kiss mark on the card then kneels down and slides the card under the door
the card slides into the pink room hitting the feet of underdog a tiny chihuahua who picks it up in his mouth and trots it over to a pair of
perfectly pedicured feet in strappy sandals
an equally perfectly manicured hand with a sisters forever charm bracelet dangling from the wrist scoops up underdog
as he rises we rise with him passing toned waxed tanned legs in pink prada pedal pushers and a pair of perky boobs encased in a spaghetti strap top until
we finally reveal a magnificent head of long blonde hair and a sweet beautiful face
this is elle woods the goddess queen of delta gamma
she talks on a pink fuzzy phone
into the phone i love you too
behind her a go usc banner is pinned to the pink wall
a stack of cosmopolitan s and glamour s teeters on the dresser
the closet overflows with trendy designer clothes in a predominance of pink
continuing into phone ill see you tonight
she hangs up and lets out a squeal of joy kissing underdogs head and taking the card out of his mouth
she reads it touched
continuing elle and warner forever

beautiful college students drink beer and mingle trying to figure out who theyre going to sleep with next

a cover of an italian vogue shows a blonde sexpot margot a usc cheerleader poster displays a hard bodied non blonde serena in a pom pom pose
serena walks up fending off an admirer
i am not going to formal with you
jeremy slinks off as margot arrives agitated
can someone please tell rick that he is not the only sigma chi with a big penis
you guys are so sweet
elle a vision of fluffy blondeness runs down the stairs toward serena and margot holding the card
but i m not positive its gonna happen to n i g h t helloo
he just had lunch with his grandmother
you know he got the rock
why else would she have flown in from newport
its not like shed fed ex a six carat diamond
excited you think
i cant believe youre getting engaged
the three girls jump up and down squealing and hugging
cmon you have to help me pick out the perfect outfit
as they head toward the door elle spots amy a shy girl in a delta gamma pledge sweatshirt standing alone
continuing amy whats wrong
i dont really know anyone
teasing thats because you spend too much time in the library
come with me
to serena and margot ill meet you outside
as they go elle leads amy over to a group of jovial sigma chi brothers
continuing bra ndon jason grant this is amy
why dont you tell her about the time you guys went golfing naked
elle winks at amy and
heads off as the guys launch into their story
it was classic
jason hit with wood all day
and we never ran out of balls amy laughs
serena and margot watch as elle stands in front of a mirror trying on a herve leger white mini dress
sexy and ultra tight
i think you should go with red
its the color of confidence
well i dont want to look like i know whats coming
i dont understand why youre completely disregarding your signature color
she holds up a tiny pink slipdress
i cant look like i would on any date
this is the date
the night ill always remember
i want to look special
but not like i suspect anything
a saleswoman looks at her cohort
to there s nothing i love more than a dumb blonde with daddys plastic
she grabs a dress off the clearance sale rack ripping off the half price tag
i cant wait to see you wearing the rock
elle looks at them suddenly concerned
wh at if you know its not the night
why else would he be taking you to the ivy
youve been dating for a year its not like hes trying to impress you
elle youve heard the man pass gas in his sleep
that practically means youre pre engaged
the saleswoman approaches with the dress kiss assy smile on her face
did you see this one
we just got it in yesterday
elle fingers the dress then the new price tag looking back at the saleswoman excited
is this a low viscosity rayon
uh yes of course
with half loop top stitching on the hem
smiling a lie absolutely
its one of a kind
elle hands the dress back to her no longer pretending to be excited
its impossible to use a half loop topstitch on low viscosity rayon
it would snag the fabric
and you didnt just get this in because i remember it from the june vogue a year ago so if youre trying to sell it to me at full price
you picked the wrong girl
the saleswoman slinks off embarrassed
to the saleswoman nice try
elle shakes her head and turns back to the girls as she slips on her manolo blahnik sandals doing one last mirror check smoothing down her golden mane
dramatically girls this is it
in a few hours ill be the future mrs
warner huntington iii
an attractive male finger presses the doorbell
amy peeks through the peephole and turns
whispering hes here
elle standing nearby with margot and serena and several other dgs smooths down her dress and takes a deep breath o pening the door to find warner huntington iii tall
chiseled and outrageously handsome
he takes her in a smile spreading across his face
so are you
she looks up at him blushing and completely smitten
after a moment warner extracts himself
nervous you ready
her face is awash with devotion
i am so ready
warner and elle are seated at a cozy table on the patio
elle takes a sip from her freshly poured champagne flute
nervous and excited
here s to us
warner is slower to sip his
the reason i wanted to come here tonight was to discuss our future
elle is on the edge of her seat
i m fully amenable to that discussion
i mean were having a lot of fun now but things are gonna be different when i m at harvard law school is a completely different world
i need to be serious
my family expects a lot from me
and i expect a lot from me
plan on running for office some day
and i fully support that
but the thing is if i m gonna be a senator by the time i m thirty i cant keep dicking around
i completely agree
t hat s why i think its time for us to elle takes a deep breath filled with anticipation
ot n ig
c n iu n i think we should break up
elles champagne glass drops from her hand and crashes onto the patio
elle starts to flush completely caught off guard
i m sorry elle i just youre breaking up with me
tearing up i thought you were proposing
elle if i m going to be a politician i need to marry a jackie not a marilyn
stunned youre breaking up with me because i m too blonde
t hat s not entirely then what
my boobs are too big
elle no your boobs are fine her tears start
so when you said youd always love me you were just dicking around
warner looks around the restaurant nervously
i do love you elle
i just cant marry you
you have no idea the pressure i m under
my family has five generations of senators
my brother is in the top three at yale law
he just got engaged to a vanderbilt for crissakes
elle stares at him aghast tears streaming down her face then pushes her chair away from the table and walks out
continuing its not like i have a choice sweetheart he follows her out
elle teeters down the sidewalk as best she can in her three inch heels sobbing
warner pulls up alongside her in his convertible saab
let me take you home
elle its twenty miles back to campus
elle stops thinks a minute then gets in still crying
catching her poofy little purse in the door
she re opens i t yanking the purse back in
warner pulls out
warner pulls up in front
its a starry romantic night
everything should be perfect
elle sits still in shock as tears continue to eke out
elle believe me i never expected to be doing this but i think its the right thing to do
how can it be the right thing if were not together
i have to think about my future
and what people expect from me
so youre breaking up with me because youre afraid your family wont like me
through her tears everybody likes me
east coast people are different
just because i m not a vanderbilt all of a sudden i m white trash
i grew up in bel air warner
across the street from aaron spelling
i think most people would agree thats way better than a vanderb ilt i told you elle
i need someone serious
i m seriously in love with you isnt that enough
he looks away
i m sorry
she gets out of the car and drags herself up the stairs to her sorority house
when shes at the top she turns back to look at him
his perfect cheekbones highlighted by the streetlamp
he meets her eyes pained but determined
then pulls away leaving her there
elle walks down the pink and green carpeted hall dazed and tear stained
margot and serena emerge from the bathroom post shower
getting ready for a night out
why are you back so soon
serena sees elles bare hand
did he forget the ring
elle silently walks into her room
serena and margot follow worried
elle slumps down in an inflatable chair hugging her knees and cowering in a wretched little ball
underdog stares at her concerned
serena and margot stand in the door
wheres the rock
were not engaged
he broke up with me
serena and margot gasp in horror rushing to her side
is it a kappa
its not a theta no its just not me
i m canceling the mixer
well blacklist sigma chi
thank you serena but i dont think itll do any good
elle starts to lose it again
i dont know
everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone mo r e sob choked serious
s e r i o u s
who the hell does he think he i s
y o u r e the most popu l a r month on the u s c calendar

last month on his birthday
and she liked me
she said i looked like britney spears
why would you say that to someone you didnt like
they shrug mystified
how could this happen
i dont know
i dont know anything any more
wiping a tear i just need to be by myself
are you sure
the girls rise hugging her
we still love you
sniffling thank you
i love you too
as they go margot looks at serena
what if josh doesnt think i m serious enough
you let him have anal sex with you
you let him videotape you diddling yourself
as the girls go they shut the door behind them
elle gets up and grabs a framed photo of warner then lies down on her bed clutching it to her heart
underdog leaps up and gives her little doggy kisses
the sun rises on a sad day
hopelessly devoted by olivia newton john plays
amy knocks on elles door
another sister passes
whispering didnt you hear
she leads a reluctant amy down the hall
spread out on the bed are pictures of elle and warner the sigma chi formal their homecoming queen and king wave
a s party mardi gras night beach weekend at coronado
next to the pictures are thirty dried ecuardorian long stemmed pink roses remnants of their one year anniversary
in the center sits elle wearing warners old oversized sigma chi t shirt clutching a gund teddybear
depressed and looking like hell she speaks to an unseen confidante
i just love him so much
i loved him the first moment i saw him
hes beautiful and smart and someone i totally respect
and i did everything i could to make him love me but it wasnt enough
now what am i supposed to do
i planned my whole future around him
my life was going to be all about warner
now whats it going to be about
she looks up waiting
staring back at her is underdog who sadly has no answers for her
elle remains in bed underdog now clutched to her chest soaps on the tv
on tv oh darling
ill love you forever
serena and margot enter bearing jamba juice
you have to leave this room its been a week
s erena sits down on the edge of the bed trying to psyche elle up
whats the thing that always makes us feel better no matter what
elle lets out a wail realizing what shell be missing
serena shoots margot a stern look
no the thing after that a row of uniformed manicurists and their classy clients
therapy in full session
serena sits in front of her regular nail technician
it was awful
we all thought shed be the first to walk down the aisle and now shes totally adrift
the nail technician shakes her head in shared girl power angst looking over at elle who sits in the waiting area shell shocked but showered
elle picks up the only magazine left on the table town country
she wrinkles her nose
an old lady next to her reads seventeen
elle looks at her begrudging the access to teen beauty tips and flips through town country n oisily until she freezes on the engagement section
oh my god
she looks at a photo of a horse faced young woman standing next to a three years older version of warner
she turns to the old lady next to her
continuing do you know who this is
the old lady looks
its warners older brother
elle continues undaunted
he just got engaged to this this very unfortunate looking girl
reading third year yale law student putnam bowes huntington iii and his fiance layne walker vanderbilt first year yale law
she turns to the old lady
continuing this is the type of girl warner wants to marry
this is what i need to become to be serious
the old lady looks at the picture
no a law student
elle rushes out
serena looks after her
turning back to her nail technician shell never get him back with those cuticles
elle sits in front of her advisor
flummoxed harvard law school
but its a top three school offended i have a

harvard wont be impressed that you aced history of lycra
what are your backups
i dont need backups

he decides to humor her
youll need excellent recommendations from your professors a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one seventy five on your lsats
confident i once had to judge a theta chi tighty whitey contest
trust me i can handle anything
elle sits on the floor surrounded by piles of lsat prep books the framed photo of warner and underdog
theres a knock at the door as serena and margot peek inside gasping in horror at the sight of books
what are you doing
elle smiles brightly at them
reading about the lsats
margot looks at serena confused
in a horrified whisper my cousin had them
apparently you get a really bad rash on your elle interrupts her
the lsats are an exam
she takes a deep breath
continuing girls i m going to harvard

they look at her confused
i mean i know youre upset and all but cant you just take a sedative
elle rolls her eyes at their naivete
once warner sees me as a serious law student hell want me back
its a completely brilliant plan
but isnt it kind of hard to get into law school
i have the highest gpa in delta gamma
margot pulls something off her wrist and hands it to elle
youre gonna need this
my lucky scrunchie

serena rolls her eyes and looks at margot disapprovingly
you passed spanish because you gave professor montoya a hand job after the final

all those opposed to chafing pleas

the sisters aye in unison
underdog barks his approval
lsat prep course is written on the board
elle and forty other law school hopefuls take notes furiously as practice questions are reviewed

her eyes light up and she looks at amy pleadingly
amy shakes her head no
elle slumps then rises and goes to the window closing the shades and getting back to work

she turns to serena jogging next to her
continuing calvin kleins spring line is atrocious

amy rushes in with a stack of mail waving an lsat envelope as she calls out
elle rushes down the stairs as the other delta gammas gather around
elle takes the envelope and says a quick prayer
one seventy five
one seventy five
she opens it and stares at it for a long moment
then turns it to the crowd and raises it above her head in triumph
the girls immediately begin jumping up and down as group joy ensues
underdog yips with pride
the montage ends
on the tv elle stands up in the jacuzzi
on tv and thats why you should vote for me
for the class of
the video is paused as three admissions guys in their

stunned silence fills the room
finally one of them speaks
that was certainly a very adjusting himself imaginative essay
to the dean she does have a
from usc and she got a one seventy nine on her lsats
a fashion major
well weve never had one before
arent we always looking for diversity
her list of extracurriculars is impressive
the dean looks at her application
unimpressed she was in a ricky martin video clearly shes interested in music
reading on skeptical she also designed a line of faux fur panties for her sororitys charity project then shes a friend to animals as well as a philanthropist
i think its obvious that shes a very well rounded individual
he points to elle freeze framed in her bikini top on video on the tv
the admissions guys look to the dean
elle woods welcome to harvard
elles parents daniel in tennis clothes and the face lifted sapphire stare at elle over juice by the pool
frowning law school
sapphire puts a hand to her throat in distress
elle is confused
its a perfectly respectable place
sweetheart you dont need law school
law school is for people who are boring and ugly and serious
and you button are none of those things
sapphire is in agreement
you were first runner up in the miss hawaiian tropic contest
why throw all that away
because this is what i want
ive worked hard for it
dont you understand that this is important to me
she looks at her uncomprehending parents
continuing going to harvard is the only way i can get the love of my life back
sapphire looks at her still not getting it
cant you just suck his wiener
cant you just get your nose done
elle reacts to her mothers skewed logic
pale studious law students clad in earth tones move into their dorm carrying in their spartan belongings coffee makers books computers
in the distance a happy pop song perhaps heaven tonight by hole is heard
as it gets louder heads turn to see a silver convertible boxster driving up elle at the wheel music blasting
a large moving van follows the boxster
peop le lean out of their windows buzzing with interest as elles car stops in front of the dorm
she hops out scooping up underdog and looking every inch the la fred segal glamour queen as she looks around with a smile
elle looks at underdog
she bends down to pour some evian into his inflatable doggy dish inadvertently revealing cleavage to a passing bespectacled boy several yards away
he trips dropping his i mac
it shatters into a million pieces
not noticing elle stands and turns to two moving guys who are hauling a pink faux fur love seat and a potted palm tree out of the truck
continuing this way guys
with a beauty queen smile in place she strides into the dorm as the other students watch in amazement
arrogant aaron a mensa geek with attitude turns to his roommate

what the hell
watching her go malibu barbie lives
elle sits at the outdoor table ignoring her slice of pizza as she looks around for warner
not finding him she turns her attention to the group leader a burned out l in a red t shirt
welcome to law school
this is the part where we go around in a circle and everyone says a little bit about themselves
lets start with you
he gestures at a guy with glasses dorky david
i have a masters in russian literature a ph
d in biochemistry and for the last eighteen months ive been de worming orphans in somalia
how about you enid
enid a militant feminista looks up
d from berkeley in womens studies emphasis in the history of combat
and last year i led the march for lesbians against drunk driving
he looks at an intense guy in his late twenties ivan
ive got an mba from wharton worked on wall street for four years mushed in three ididarods and i ve figured out how to crash the stock market in sri
lanka if any of you want to get together later
what about you
he looks at elle
she sits up straight
i m a gemini
i have a bachelors degree from usc where i was sigma chi sweetheart and president of delta gamma and last year i was homecoming queen
she smiles as the group leader nods waiting
dramatically two weeks ago i saw cameron diaz at fred segal and talked her out of buying a truly heinous angora sweater
whoever said that orange is the new pink is seriously disturbed
she looks around pleased
enid snickers as the rest of the group stares at elle dumbfounded
a grey dingy cell block style room now crammed with elles clothes the pink fluffy love seat and potted palm along with an elliptical cross trainer pink flamingo party lights
and a neon pink margarita glass sculpture
elle tries to shove a large law textbook into her tiny prada backpack to no avail
she gives up and tosses the book onto the bed where underdog leaps away to miss being squished
wish me luck underdog
its my first class as a serious law student
she kisses him and looks down at her completely inappropriate skimpy gucci outfit which she accents by putting on trendy wire rimmed glasses
continuing to herself i totally look the part
elle heads for a classroom amidst a crowd of students who eye her like shes an alien
she rounds a corner seeing warner in all his handsome glory looking over his schedule
she starts toward him as if pulled by a magnetic force
arrogant aaron sees her passing by
seductively h l o t e e
elle keeps going not even noticing him
eyes only for warner
arrogant aaron stomps away pissed at the perceived blow off
as elle gets closer to warner she opts for wandering past him seemingly oblivious to his presence
elle turns ultra nonchalant
oh my god i completely forgot you were going here
he looks at her confused
people walk by staring
whatre you talking about
youre not here to see me
i go here
still confused you go where
v y y ou g o t in to ha rv a rd l aw
con fuse d at his confusion w h at like its that
w a rn e r stares at her completely discombobulated
she s m i l es sweetly and makes a show of checking her watch
time for class
meet me after
on the benches
she sashays off with a confident smile
students file in and take their seats
elle enters looking around nervously at the imposing auditorium
arrogant aaron next to her leans over
if youre looking for the best seat i hear the front row is the place to be
elle smiles at him
professor elspeth stromwell a tough as nails grande dame in her s addresses the class
laptops abound except for elle who has a fuzzy pink notebook and a pen with a pink plastic heart on the end
a legal education means you will learn to speak in a new language
you will be taught to achieve insight into the world around you and to sharply question what you know
everyone soaks this up
continuing the seat youve picked is yours for the next nine months of your life
and those of you in the front row beware
el le in the front row between two unshowered braniacs looks around panicked
one of the braniacs passes her the seating chart and she has no choice but to sign her name
in the back arrogant aaron nudges his friend and smiles
continuing the law is reason free from passion
does anyone know who spoke those immortal words
dorky david raises his hand
professor stromwell approaches him the way cruella de ville approaches a puppy
are you sure
now hes not
would you be willing to stake your life on it
i think so
h o w about she spins around roughly poking another student in the head
continuing his life
scared i dont know
well i recommend knowing before speaking
the law leaves much room for interpretation but very little for self doubt
as she turns away continuing and you were right
it was aristotle
the class half laughs in relief
continuing i assume youve all read pages and are now well versed in subject matter jurisdiction
elle looks around surprised as students open their books
continuing who can tell us about gordon v
stromwell looks down at the seating chart
continuing ivan greenstein
intense ivan straightens in his seat
gordon sued her doctors for malpractice
and what did the dispute entail
looking at her chart lets call on someone in the hot zone
elle looks up distressed
i wasnt aware that we had an assignment
looking at her chart sarah knottingham
sarah knottingham a prim and preppy blue blood brunette dressed in pearls and a sweater set looks up
continuing do you think its acceptable that ms
woods is unprepared
sarah looks over at elle
elle gives her a mortified smile
sarah turns back to professor stromwell
no i dont
would you support my decision to ask her to leave and return to class only when she is prepared
elle cant believe that this girl would betray her
having no choice she gathers her purse and goes completely humiliated
professor stromwell returns to the matter at hand
knottingham did diversity jurisdictionexist in this case
emmett a shy and quirkily handsome year old who could pass for younger sits on a bench going over some papers
he looks up and spots elle sitting across from him looking traumatized
are you okay
elle looks up snapping out of her stupor
do they just put you on the spot like that
like all the time
yeah they tend to do that
and if you dont know the answer they just kick you out
you have stromwell
hopeful did she do that to you too
no but she made me cry once
not in class i waited until i got to my room but yeah she can pretty much shrivel your balls or you know your whatevers
it gets better
who else do you have
elle looks at her schedule
donovan royalton and levinson
speak up in donovans class
he likes people with an opinion
sit in the back for royalton
he tends to spit when he talks about products liability
elle makes a face
continuing and make sure you read the footnotes in levinsons class
thats where all her exam questions come from
i m glad i met you
she smiles at him grateful
oh and getting one of stromwells daily quotes right is almost as important as acing the mid term
but you didnt hear it from me
students trickle out of the building
are you a third year
warner walks up behind emmett interrupting
elle looks up pure adoration on her face
emmett rises and walks off
calling after him thanks again for your help
warner remains standing still somewhat uncomfortable with her presence here
s o uh how was your first class
except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my civ pro professor
but no biggie
youre here now
perky how was your summer
she pats the bench beside her
he doesnt move
do anything exciting
a female hand snakes around warners chest from behind
warner turns and brings the owner of the hand around to his side presenting her
nervous urn hey have you met sarah
sarah the horrible girl herself holds out her hand to elle full of contempt
to warner horrified you know her
she s sarah jumps in
i m his fiancee
elle stares at her
sarah tucks a piece of her mousy brown hair behind her ear and there it is the rock
in disbelief im sorry i just hallucinated
sarah was my girlfriend at prep school
we got back together over the summer at my grandmothers birthday party
elle looks stricken
sarah gives her a smug smile
warner told me all about you
youre famous at our club
she says it in a way that is anything but flattering
in fact its completely condescending
continuing pointedly but he didnt tell me youd be here
i didnt know elle looks from warner to sarah
she rushes off
sarah watches her go a smug grin on her face to warner i thought you said she was pretty
elle drives wiping the tears from her face
she spots something off to the side and swerves her car toward it a gasp of hope escaping her lips
her car stops in front of a strip mall salon called beauty oasis
a downscale blue collar salon with five hair chairs and two manicure stations
old ladies and young waitresses get perms
paulette early s lower middle class hard edged plus sirzed looks up as a defeated elle sinks into the manicure chair
the manicure station is plastered with pictures of rufus a big slobbering pit bull
elle holds out her hands
paulette dips them into a dish of soapy water
you cant even imagine
elle lets it all out in a rush
i worked really hard to get into law school i blew off spring break and greek week to study for the lsats i completely neglected my homecoming queen duties i
hired a coppola to direct my admissions video all so i could get my boyfriend warner back and now hes engaged to this awful girl sarah so it was all for nothing
i wish i d never even come to harvard
paulette dries elles hands and begins filing
after you went to all that trouble
well what am i supposed to do
shes got the family six carat on her bony unpolished finger
youre asking the wrong girl
i m with my guy eight years and then one day its i met someone else
horrified whatd you do
cried a lot and gained twenty pounds
dewey kept the trailer and my precious baby rufus
i got jackcrap
she looks at a picture of the pit bull
continuing re the dog i didnt even get to go to his birthday party
what could i do
shrugging hes a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures
i m a middle aged high school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass
happens every day
at least to women like me
so whats this sarah got that you dont
shes from connecticut
she belongs to his stupid country club
is she as pretty as you
elle looks down
embarrassed i m not pretty i m genetically blessed
paulette rolls her eyes shaking her bottle of polish and starting on elles right hand
she could use some mascara and some serious highlights but shes not completely unfortunate looking
paulette looks up to see the ups guy a strapping hunk of a man in his late s
she blushes and smooths down her hair knocking over a bottle of nail polish in the process
trying to play it off as she signs for the package
see ya later
paulette watches him
could i be anymore goddamn spastic
beat so youre sure this warner guy is the one
i love him
paulette looks at her
if a girl like you cant hold on to her man then there sure as hell isnt any hope for the rest of us
whatre you waiting for
steal the bastard back
elle knocks on warners door bottle of wine and two glasses in hand
when she gets no answer she write a message on his memo board close on call me
love you know who
she leaves the wine bottle and two glasses and goes
elle is in her push up bikini reclining in her beach chair pink frozen margarita in one hand underdog in the other law book in her lap pretending to study
we pull back to reveal that shes sitting on the sidelines of a touch football game that warner is playing with a group of other ls
warner scores easily because the other male eyes are all on elle
he shakes his head and smiles
elle sits glaring at sarah who keeps waving her the rock in elles direction as she plays footsie with warner
professor donovan s a big fan of himself salt and pepper hair no time for bullshit stands before the class
i should warn you that in addition to competing against each other for the top grade in this class youll also be competing for one of my firms highly coveted
four internship spots next year where you will get to assist on actual cases
let the bloodbath begin
now lets commence with our usual torture he looks around
woods sarah and her bitchy clone like friend claire exchange knowing glances
this should be amusing
would you rather have a client who committed a crime malum in se or malum prohibitum
id rather have a client whos innocent
elle smiles proud of her answer
the class snickers
dare to dream ms
which would you prefer
because the client wouldve committed a regulatory infraction as opposed to a dangerous crime
elle raises her hand
i changed my mind
i d pick the dangerous one
she looks pointedly at sarah
continuing i m not afraid of a challenge
sarah glares back at her
warner looks between the two of them worried
the harvard public interest law association meeting is o underway
listens intently a few seats away elle appears to be taking notes
c l o se on her notes im free for dinner tonight
meet me at the cask flagon at
she folds the note and sticks it in underdogs mouth then points him toward warner
humiliated but dutiful underdog bounds off
close on underdog as he carries forth his mission arriv ing at warners feet
underdogs pov warner discreetly takes the note from him then looks over at elle who feigns interest in the meeting
elle waits for warner alone at a table
checking her watch to see its she tries not to be sad
warner and his study group sarah and claire included sit at a table going over their outlines
elle walks up to the table holding a basket of muffins bright smile on her face
i m here to join your study group
i brought sustenance
she holds up the muffins as the others look up frowns all around
nervously looking at sarah elle whatre you doing here
elle pulls up a chair from another table and holds up a muffin
she sits down next to warner
our group is full
oh god was this like an rsvp thing
no its like a smart people thing
and like sarah said were full
come on we can make room for one more
sarah looks at warner with evil eyes
weve already assigned the outlines and everyone has started theirs to warner besides you wouldnt let the fat guy join
he tried to watch me takea shower
sarah looks at elle
the answer is no
warner looks at her feeling guilty
he shrugs an im sorry but elles perkiness has gone
she gathers up her muffins and stands clutching the basket to her chest as she goes
then i guess ill leave you alone
she walks away completely deflated passing by the raging feminist study group
enid calls out
maybe theres a sorority you could join instead
elle stops and looks at her
to enid you know if youd come to a rush party i wouldve at least been nice to you
before you voted against me and called me a dyke behind my back
i dont use that word
only mean people use that word
you mustve heard it from sarah
she looks back at warners table and walks off
as she does
shes nearly mowed down by a gaggle of nerds led by dorky david who knock the muffins out of her hands
she stands there even more depressed
elle sinks down onto her bed deflated
she picks up the phone and dials
serena with a new hairdo and margot are surrounded by wedding dresses
margot talks on her cell phone
we to serena its elle
into phone guess what i m doing right this second
picking out my wedding dress
startled n o way serena grabs the phone
into phone po you have the rock yet
well hurry up so you can come home
we miss you
i miss you guys
the people here are so vile
hardly anyone even talks to me unless its to say something thats not nice
law school sucks
oh my god
i completely forgot to tell you
i got bangs
hurt and annoyed re a ll y margot grabs the phone back
into phone keep june first open youre one of my bridesmaids
and give warner our love
margot hangs up and elle follows suit
even more deflated
sarah and claire walk past elles room the door of which is ajar
its not just any halloween party
its a come as your favorite defendant party
that s genius
elle pops her head out of the room
excited no way
someone at this school is actually having a party
sarah and claire turn around
elles face falls when she sees that its them
you mustve heard us wrong
looks like youll be staying home ton ig ht
they continue on as elle goes back into her room snubbed
elle shuts the door behind her and looks at underdog
i cant believe this
not only do i not have warner but i m unpopular
the realization hits her hard
she looks at him
continuing but i wasnt invited
he barks again
continuing you really think i should
two feet in high heels and fishnet hose stride purposefully up the sidewalk
a perfect butt wearing a bunny tail wiggles up the steps
a party filled with people who are no fun to party with
nametags denote which famous defendant everyone is dressed as
menenedezs tonya hardings and buttafucos pepper the room
elle decked out in a playboy bunny costume looking sexy as hell strides in
people roll their eyes and ignore her
elle continues on
nearby enid dressed as lizzie borden axe in hand is in the midst of a tirade against some guy dressed like william kennedy smith
the english language is all about subliminal domination
take the word semester
its a perfect example of this schools discriminatory preference of semen to ovaries
thats why i m petitioning to have next term be referred to as winter ovester
the guy backs up in fright
as elle passes enid looks over
continuing hey elle ive been meaning to ask you re her boobs are those real
enid please silicone is so s
she keeps walking
sa rah dressed as hester prynne and claire as joan of arc sip wine
continuing sarcastic thanks for inviting me girls
this party is super fun
they roll their eyes checking out her bunny costume
youre supposed to be dressed as a famous defendant
elle smiles at sarah
didnt you hear about the playboy bunny who slit her ex boyfriends new fiancees throat with a broken wine glass
it was tragic
she grabs a glass of wine and moves on
elle walks onto the back porch and finds warner dressed as o
in a usc football uniform number with a ball and chain on his foot
he looks around for sarah
not seeing her he smiles at elle admiring her costume
youre a walking felony
c h e c k i n g her out now i am
flirty i feel like weve barely spent any time together since we got here
thats because i spend all my time with case studies and hypos
tell me about it
i cant imagine doing all this and donovans internship next year
scoffing elle cmon theres no way youll get the grades to qualify for one of those spots
youre not smart enough
she cant believe hes saying this
he realizes hes gone too far and back pedals
continuing i didnt mean cutting him off am i on glue or did i not get into the same law school you did warner
covering we ll yeah but but what
we took the same lsat we take th e same classes i just dont want to see you get your hopes up
you know how you get
she stares at him
realizing the awful truth
i never be good enough for you will when he doesnt answer she walks back into the house
one of them holds a salad a group of tipsy ils stand around
bowl filled with cash
i give her two more weeks
she throws a twenty into the bowl
two and a half
he throws in his twenty as well
if she spreads her legs maybe adjusting his crotch only if i m feeling generous
what is this
they turn around to find elle standing there
were betting on how much longer youre going to last
look around elle
do you actually think you belong here
they all stare at her
hurt why wouldnt i
because the rest of us provide some worthwhile value to society
hold on now every society needs a bimbo
who are we supposed to sleep with after we get rich
elle looks like shes been slapped
the others laugh at aarons esteemed wit
you know what
all of you can just kiss my ass
she yanks off her bunny tail and throws it at them
hurt and anger in her eyes
then walks out of the room
continuing to herself youre about to see just how valuable elle woods can be
she stomps out of the house
a hot pink laptop is yanked off the shelf
elle still in her bunny suit minus the tail stands in line paying for the laptop
people gape at her but shes oblivious in her resolve
emmett walks up behind her in line
he clears his throat trying not to look at her costume
elle turns seeing him
she marches off
laptop in hand
a pony tailed elle types a brief coffee next to her
underdog sleeps nearby belly up
legs twitching in a nightmare
typing furiously elle breaks a nail then struggles to forge on despite her instinct to stop and repair it
elle arms full of books walks past the warner sarah study group
sarah and claire scowl at her but elle passes with her head held high
enid is surrounded by study materials and notecards
when she gets up to use the ladies room elle casually walks over and slips a notecard into the middle of enids stack
then quickly walks on
pau lett e quizzes elle from a law textbook as her nails dry
as she waits for elles answer paulette showers underdog with kisses showing him pictures of rufus
donovan is in the midst of a lecture
he points at elle
and the purpose of diminished capacity is
she swallows nervously then speaks
to negate mens rea
donovan nods affirmatively and continues
elle hides a smile
elle reaches for a book on a high shelf but shes not tall enough
she tries a running start and leaps for it
still missing it
from the left she runs and leaps again missing again
from the right she runs and leaps again missing again
dorky david walks up and sets down a step stool at her feet
now winded she smiles her thanks stepping up to retrieve her book
enid flips through her notecards memorizing when she comes upon a picture of a naked man
oh the horror
she throws it down in disgust as if her eyes have been burned
looking around enid sees elle smiling and waving at her from across the room
elle walks past arrogant aaron as he sleeps at his study cubicle head back on the chair
she stops backs up and waves her hand over his face
when he doesnt stir she takes a magic marker out of her knapsack and leans over to write something on his forehead
elle works out on her elliptical crosstrainer as she listens to a lecture tape and watches court tv on mute
a failure to act can constitute the actus reus for accomplice liability if the defendant has the legal duty to intervene but fails to do so
arrogant aaron wakes up with a start checks his watch and rushes off to class
oblivious to his facial graffiti which we cant yet read
professor stromwell is in front of the class
so youve filed a claim
she looks over to see elle sitting there typing on her laptop
dont you also need to have evidence
everyone now stares at elle
meaning you need reasonable belief that your claim would have like evidentiary support
stromwell is somewhat impressed but doesnt show it
and what kind of evidentiary support does this case require
lets ask mr
harriman who clearly believes that i might be hungry
she looks up at arrogant aaron in the back row
who unknowingly has eat me written on his forehead
he looks back at her confused as the students around him snicker
a closed sign is on the door
through the window we see elle and paulette sitting in the empty salon laughing and clinking cans of pabst blue ribbon as they toast elles small victory
we pull back leaving them laughing as the montage ends
the state v
latimer is written on the board
a pony tailed less made up elle takes notes on her lap top as warner makes an argument
according to swinney v
neubert swinney who was also a private sperm donor was allowed visitation rights as long as he came to terms with the hours set forth by the parents
so if were sticking to past precedent mr
latimer wasnt st al ki ng he was clearly within his rights to ask for visitation
but swinney was a one time sperm donor and in our case the defendant was a habitual sperm donor who also happens to be harassing the parents in his quest
but without this mans sperm the child in question would not exist
he grins and looks around as the class murmurs their agreement
now youre thinking like a lawyer
emmett enters from the back holding a file
he stands there quietly watching
elle tentatively raises her hand
sarah looks at claire
sotto the idiot speaks
huntington makes an excellent point i have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life
the class titters
elle grows annoyed
bemused why do you ask
elles hesitancy is replaced by conviction
well unless the defendant attempted to contact every single one night stand to determine if a child resulted in those unions then he has no parental claim whatsoever over this
why this s p e rm
emmetts mouth twitches into a smile
continuing for that matter all masturbatory emissions where his sperm was clearly not seeking an egg could be termed reckless abandonment
warners mouth hangs open
as does sarahs and the rest of the class
i believe youve just won your case
as the students file out elle passes donovan
you did well today
youre applying for my internship arent you
i don t know you should
do you have a resume
she pulls a resume out of her briefcase and hands it to him
he looks at it
gives it that extra little something doesnt it
smiling see you tomorrow
she walks on
emmett walks up handing the file to donovan
i brought you the windham notes
watching elle go you think she just woke up one morning and said i think ill go to law school today
ei timett looks after elle bemused
aside from that lapse in judgement shes got potential
paulette is shotgun
you showed up warner in class
youre supposed to be showing up sarah
i couldnt help it
it was the most fun ive had since ive been in law school
not only was i good enough for warner i was better than him
he has to see serious i am now
even donovan was impressed and hes a total hard ass
elle stops the car and turns off the ignition
yes you are
go you can do this
she points ahead of them
the door opens
dewey s and his beer gut emerge
paulette is on the porch
trying to exude confidence but failing
to paulette what the hell do yon want
were eating dinner
i just you just thought youd come over and show me what i m definitely not missing
she watches frowning
deweys really having fun now
what the hell happened to you
you get a job at a donut shop
thats not what how many times you gonna show up here beggin me to take you back
paulette reddens flustered and humiliated
elle appears next to her
whos askin i m elle woods
paulette looks at elle in surprise elle keeps going
under state law you and ms
bonaf ante had a common law marriage which entitles her to the benefits of property law and an equitable division of assets
paulette watches elle mouth hanging open
confused come again
due to the fact that you retained the residence ms
bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately
tell him paulette
a still stunned paulette looks at elle then turns to dewey fire in her ass
i m taking the dog dumbass
calling into the trailer cmere baby mommys here
rufus bounds out licking and kissing paulette
the love evident
elle paulette and rufus get in
w e did it
elle high fives her
god that felt great
look at him
hes still scratching his head
which must be a nice vacation for his bls
she turns to rufus hugging him
and now mommys got somebody to eat dinner with again
you dont care what mommys butt looks like do you
elle looks over at paulette heart going out to her
elle turns on her powerbook as professor stromwell faces the class with her morning quote
an image and a good hook can get you into a room but something has to keep you in that room
she looks around as hands are raised
judge sandra day connor
intense ivans face falls
she looks around seeing elle raising her hand
the class rolls their eyes and laughs watching stromwell
thought i d get everyone on that one
the class cant believe elle is right
a throng of buzzing students is gathered around the bulletin board
elle walks up
whats going on
donovans firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy hes taking on first year interns
he chose them already
sarah at the front of the throng gasps then turns to warner
we got it
he grins and she kisses him on the cheek
elle shoved to the back tries to get closer when she hears the competition must not have been that stiff
arrogant aaron pushes his way to the board
got a spot
watch your hands mr
ignoring her that only leaves one for elle now next to him gets a look at the board
she turns and faces the throng
they stare back at her in shock
dignified she walks through them as they part for her stopping in front of warner and sarah
continuing to warner remember the time after winter formal
when we spent four incredible hours in the hot tub
sarah looks away
this is way better than that
pushing sarah aside excuse me
i have some shopping to do
as she goes surprised chatter overtakes the hallway
elle scans the racks of conservative clothes
she holds up a cashmere twinset and wrinkles her nose but throws it over her arm anyway
elle admires a trendy handbag but then promptly sets it down and picks up a practical leather briefcase
the elevator door opens and warner and elle emerge
elle is sporting her new boring lawyer clothes
warner is baffled and impressed by her transformation
you look nice
she gives him an aloof smile and walks off
warner watches her go
sarah stands in the lobby
none too happy to witness this
donovan strides through the office his four interns behind him
he points as he walks
theres your office theres the bathroom theres the coffee machine
theres gerard dick and bobby
gerard smarmy and trim dick short and bald and bobby black and bespectacled wave as the interns pass by
continuing theyre the other associates on the case
ask them all your stupid questions save the smart ones for me
professor donovan opens his briefcase as elle sarah enid and warner hang on his every word
were defending brooke windham whose very wealthy husband was found shot to death in their beacon hill mansion
youd think so since the stiff was sixty but she was rich on her own
some kind of fitness empire
you can buy her exercise tapes on infomercials
wait a minute are we talking about brooke daniels
donovan checks his papers
m a i d e n name daniels
looking up you know her
she was a delta gamma
not in my pledge class or anything she graduated five years ahead of me
but i used to take her class at the la sports club
the others looks at each other and roll their eyes
she could make you drop three pounds in one class
shes completely gifted
well in all likelihood shes completely guilty as well
she was seen standing over her husbands dead body
b y who
correcting him whom
his twenty seven year old daughter and the pool boy
maybe she found him like that
thats the story shell be telling the jury
we just have to prove it
emmett walks in and sits
sorry i m late
elle looks at him confused
this is emmett kerrigan another associate
top three in his class and former editor of h a r v a r d law review
youve probably seen h i m lurking around campus doing my research
or napping on the quad
elle smiles at him
he smiles back
to donovan what about the murder weapon
the gun is missing
the coroner said hed been dead thirty minutes dead when the cops arrived giving brooke plenty of time to stash it
theres no way brooke couldve done this exercise gives you endorphins endorphins make you happy happy people dont kill their husbands
sarah and enid snort
you dont really believe shes innocent
of course i do
emmett looks at her
then we may actually have a case
he looks over at donovan whos not so sure
grey and imposing
donovan sits at a long table next to brooke a pretty year old blonde with a perfect body and a sad face
the interns and associates sit at the far end of the table taking notes
a cop stands guard at the door
i cant tell you
you understand youre on trial for murder
i didnt do it
i walked in saw my husband lying on the floor bent down to check his heart screamed my head off and chutney and enrique ran inside
where they saw you standing over the body covered in his blood
she glares at him
why would i kill my husband
a love affair
pure unadulterated hatred
believe me the da will come up with plenty of reasons
i l ov ed h im
he was thirty four years older than you
that doesnt sound so good to a jury
now shes pissed
then show them a picture of his cock
they might put a few things together
everyone stiffens except for ell
e who laughs out loud
brooke i believe you
but a jury is gonna want an alibi
i cant give you that
and if you put me on the stand ill lie
donovan takes a moment to look at her like shes an idiot
were you with another man
go to hell
ill take that as a no
are we done for today
i believe we are
as do his minions
as they file out brooke sees elle
hey i know you
elle perks up
i m a delta gamma and i m a huge fan of yours
you took my class in la
you had the best high kick ive ever seen
are you one of my lawyers
brooke looks at elle as if shes her savior
well thank god one of you has a brain
rufus sleeps happily on the floor
elle sits in front of
paulette nails in the soapy water
i feel so bad for her
i mean shes in jail
and shes innocent
but i m the only one who believes her
donovan totally thinks shes guilty
thats because men are big fat retards who dont oh my god
the ups guy stands in the doorway with a package sun streaming in around him
paulette smooths down her hair
she turns to look as we go to butt cam close on the crisp brown shorts of a regulation ups uniform as they stretch across the taut muscular buttocks of
ups guy as he strides through the shop
when the butt stops moving we widen to reveal the ups guy now standing in front of elle and paulette
ive got a package
elle turns to paulette eyes wide
agreeing hes got a package
paulette is frozen
blushing and nervous
how ya doin today
he waits for her to sign
she remains frozen
elle takes the pen and signs for her trying to help
ups guy smiles kindly at paulette and heads out
take it easy
paulette watches him go hand over her heart
elle looks at her concerned
so this is the only interaction you two have ever had
sometimes i say okay instead of fine
have you ever considered asking him if hed like a cold beverage
or perhaps a neck massage
whats the point
matter of factly look at me
and im looking at a beautiful fabulous sexy woman
youve got the equipment you just need to read the manual
i m going to
show you a little maneuver my mother taught me when i was in junior high
in my experience it has a success rate in getting a mans attention an d when used appropriately an rate of return on a dinner invitation
the hairstylists and clients listen intrigued
continuing its called the bend snap
acting oh look
theres something on the floor that i need to pick up
she slowly bends down as if to pick up something sticking out her tush knee cocked
she slids her hand down her cocked leg until her hand touches the floor and she snaps back up boobs abouncing
continuing and snap
now you try
paulette stands up repeating the maneuver
i t s a spastic version of what elle just did
now this time put a little arch in your back and maybe get your footing more solid
paulette does it again
this time getting it right
a hair client walks over head full of curlers
she adjusts her like a yoga instructor would
but cock that knee
another client calls over
am i doing it right
elle walks over to her
more snap less bend
she turns to the rest of the clients
cmon everyone try
clients hop up out of their chairs as someone reaches over and cranks the transistor radio blaring brick house by the commodores
all the clients and technicians no matter what their age or how many foils are in there hair are up and doing the bend snap repeating the mantra as they
elle walks around them continuing to adjust them
now everyone together
they all bend in unison going down on brick bend and snapping back up on house
continuing and snap
the frivolity continues as the roomful of ladies perfect the maneuver
m au r i c e a male hair dresser comes out of the back room m i xi n g a bowl of bleach as he walks
he stops when he spots the activity
oh my god
the bend snap
to an old lady works every time
chutney curly haired and bitter sits in front of donovan the female da the associates the interns and a court
reporter as shes interviewed
i got out of the shower walked downstairs saw her standing over my father and called the police
did she have a weapon in her hand
was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon
uh yeah because the bitch shot him
was there any evidence that mrs
windham shot him
duh his dead body with a bullet in it
enrique latino and hunky as hell sits in the seat that chutney has vacated
aontinued what did you see when you entered the house
i saw mrs
windham standing over the body of mr
was she carrying a weapon
no she was crying her eyes out
so she was distraught that her husband was dead
windham is the most sweet wonderful woman i know
i have loved her since the day she hired me
she could never do something this awful
i know this because we are very close
the others shift uncomfortably then look at each other
back at enrique and his shiny unbuttoned to show his pecs shirt
the da smiles
donovan the interns and associates sit at a large table
shes screwing the pool boy
elle gasps and makes a face
there is no way a delta gamma would sleep with a man in a shiny shirt
warner back me up here
warner shrugs embarrassed
sarah looks at donovan
i hate to agree but i dont see the two of them actually wrinkling her nose doing it
women like that will screw anything
so because shes beautiful and has a good body shes easy
what book of feminist theory did you read iiiai in enid
emmett jumps in before war breaks out
okay if brooke didnt kill the guy who did
my moneys on the angry daughter or the ex wife
chutney has a trust fund
she didnt need the insurance payoff or the inheritance
what about her mother
she was in aspen at the time
ten people saw her downing cosmopolitans at the caribou club
al l i know is its not brooke
thats touching elle but we need an alibi
elle thinks about this
a nervous elle stands in front of the burly check in guard
she holds a basket of goodies
i m here to see brooke windham
licensed attorney or family member
i m her sister
he makes a note and buzzes her in
elle sits at a conference table with her basket
a door opens and a female guard brings brooke into the room
wearing a horribly tacky orange jumpsuit
are you okay
you look so sad
and so orange
i m glad its you and not donovan
he means well
hes really brilliant and all
brooke sits not looking convinced
he better be for what i m paying him
elle pushes her basket forward
i brought you some necessities
and the bible
she holds up a cosmopolitan
youre an angel
elle squirms in her seat
but i have to tell you the real reason i m here
professor donovan says we really really need your alibi
brooke tears up
elle i cant
you dont understand
who could better understand than me
brooke dabs her eyes with a corner of the pink ralph lauren sheets
its so shameful
whatever it is it could save you
thats just it it would ruin me
brooke composes herself
takes a deep breath
looks at elle
i have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the brookes butt buster workout
you helped me go from a six to a four
brooke starts to cry again
on the day of heyworths murder i was she snorts back a sob
continuing getting liposuction
completely shamed i m a fraud
but its not like normal people can have this ass
if my fans knew i d lose everything
ive already lost my husband
i rather be in jail then lose my reputation
elle hugs her to her chest consoling her
your secret is safe with me
the associates and interns sit at a table piled high with research as donovan goes over his notes
weve got two interviews tomorrow that dick and bobby are gonna handle and the ex wife in an hour
he looks up
continuing sarah can you grab me some coffee
sarah rises and fetches the coffee from the side table
continuing and according to this communique from the prison our client apparently had a visit fr om her sister
a miss delta gamma he looks at elle
continuing anyone you know
elle looks up caught
the others looks at her
i went to get her alibi
emmett looks over surprised
did you get it
but i cant tell you what it is
the others cant believe this
why the hell not
i promised her i d keep it secret
i cant break the bonds of sisterhood
now hes pissed
this is a murder trial not some scandal at the sorority house
i want the alibi
sarah sets donovans coffee down
watching to see what elle will do
i cant give it to you
all i can tell you is that shes innocent
an assistant pokes her head in the room
windham vandermark is on line two
donovan rises still annoyed
someone reason with her while i take this
he walks out
the others look at elle
are you crazy
tell him the alibi
were gonna lose the case if you dont
then were not very good lawyers
emmett hides a smile
warner leans over to elle
sarah is nearby listening
quietly if you tell him youll probably make summer associate
think about yourself
i gave her my word warner
sarah watches seeing both warner and elle in a different light
donovan storms back in
the ex wife seems to be unconcerned with the fact that her interview is today
shes at a spa in the berkshires
to elle isnt that like your mother ship
elle shrugs and looks at donovan
i can go if you want
to enid have you ever been to a spa
and subscribe to the doctrine of self hatred imposed upon my gender by male delusions of the way women are supposed to look
donovan motions toward elle
then looks at emmett with a pointed get the alibi look
go with her
emmett drives elle is shotgun
explain to me why youre so anti brooke
uh for starters she won t give us an al i bi aside from that
shes completely untrustworthy
she married an old man shes made a living on telling women theyre too fat she hawks her crap on the home shopping network
a hes an old man with a really big penis
b she never told me i was fat
and c victoria principal sells on that network
and d brooke is obviously hiding something
but maybe its not what you think
bu t maybe it is
theyre quiet for a moment
she looks at him
youre kind of being a butt head right now
amused how do you figure
because people arent always what they seem to be and you refuse to see that
have a little faith
you might be surprised
theyre quiet again while he thinks about this
he looks over at her
i cant believe you called me a butt head
no ones called me a butt head since ninth grade
maybe not to your face
she gives him a teasing smile
he smiles back at her shaking his head
elle and emmett are at the desk
we have two oclock massages
kerrigan and woods
go on back
elle starts to go then stops
oh and my friend katherine windham vandermark is here somewhere and i m supposed to meet her
for a pilates class
do you have her schedule
checking shes in the mud room until four
elle smiles her thanks and walks off with emmett
we cant see her for an hour
no she cant move for an hour
she grabs his arm and pulls him down the hall
windham vandermark late s brunette east coast hoity t o i t y lies on a table like a corpse stiff with mud cucumbers over her eyes
elle and emmett poke their heads in
were here from austen platt jaret donovan so you found me
emmett looks at elle
sotto shes naked
i m covered in very expensive egyptian mud hardly naked
to emmett ill cover her parts
elle settles on three washcloths strategically placed
so i hear the tart from california shot heyworth
well thats what were trying to prove didnt happen
do you have any reason to believe it did
i never met the woman but from what my daughter tells me shes quite the cun interrupting her shes not
did your daughter ever say anything to you about brooke and heyworths relationship
aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial
she said they humped like gorillas
chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house
i m sure that was very awkward for chutney
sotto much as it is for me hearing you tell about it
but i guess it wasnt enough for brooke
why do you say that
havent you seen the cabana boy
like i said ive never met brooke but i have seen her from a distance
when i d come over to pick up the alimony check that heyworth forgot to mail every month shed be out by the pool with mr
hot pants hovering over her with some pink drink
i didnt stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth but i d bet my next check that that s where he was about
to put it
emmett drives raving
how can you still believe shes innocent
youre going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment
shes ly ing
and you know this for a fact
did you see the icky black color of her hair
i never trust a woman whos not blonde
except for my friend serena but thats only because shes a blonde at heart
thats the whole reason i m starting the blonde legal defense fund
he looks at her and laughs
blondes are discriminated against worldwide
brookes a blonde and people are saying shes sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband
if she was a mousy brunette it would be oh the poor widow
shes fired up now
you should see the way i m treated in class
im a complete source of mockery
this is why the blonde legal defense fund is needed
he goes along with it won over by her enthusiasm
okay how would it work
it would be a full service law firm by and for blondes providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas
i mean think about it name one blonde intellectual role model
that is a direct result of anti blonde discrimination
wait hilary clinton
if she were a true blonde she wouldve left the cheating bastard
blondes dont let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it
in that case maybe heyworth got fellated by a brunette and brooke caught him
exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty year old man can take
thats not really a topic that keeps me up at night but maybe it should
elle digs in her purse
speaking of that i bought you some seaweed cream while we were at the spa
she hands it to him
he keeps his hands on the wheel not taking it
what the hell is that for
the bags under your eyes
youre an attractive man but you need to take better care of yourself
i dont gesturing to the cream do that stuff
well you should
i f you look good you feel good and if you feel good you project joy into the world
projecting joy is not my job
sorry i brought it up
she puts the cream back in her purse
they ride in silence fo r a moment
then you really think i m attractive
for a butt head
she smiles at him
elle walks down the sidewalk to her dorm approaching dorky david as he tries to ask out a freshman girl who thinks shes a lot cuter than she actually is
she stands with her freshman friends
so i called your room last night
cold i heard
i was thinking maybe we could go out sometime
uh n o
youre a dork
turns back to her friends who all laugh at him
elle winces as she passes
hopeful i m in law school the freshman girl turns back to him
look i m not going out with you
i cant believe youd even ask
girls like me dont go out with losers like you
her friends snicker
elle stops at this and sighs acknowledging to herself that she has to help this guy
she turns and marches back slapping dorky david across the face
dorky david is stunned as is the freshman girl
upset why didnt you call me
we spend a beautiful night together and then i never hear from you again
i uh elle signals with her eyes for him to go along with it
continuing im sorry
f or what
breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man
u h both
ive already spent too many hours crying over you
she rushes off
dorky david and the freshman girl and her friends watch elle go
after a moment the girl turns to david
so urn when did you wanna go out
i m free on friday
w al k in g away elle hears this and smiles
p e op le ascend the wide courthouse steps
th e first district court is now in session
th e honorable judge william r
t he da grills mrs
a nd what was the defendant doing
s it ti n g next to the pool topless while th e latin boy handed her a drink
da rafferty continues her grilling
a n d where was she exactly
t h i s time chutney is on the stand
st and in g over my fathers dead body
close on a tiny speedo thong
salvatore can you tell us what this is
we pull back to reveal that the da is holding it up as she questions enrique
this is the uniform that mrs
windham asked you to wear while cleaning her pool
and are you or are you not having an affair with brooke windham
enrique shifts in his seat
have you inserted your genitalia into hers
objection to enrique have you and mrs
windham had sexual relations
the courtroom gasps
elle looks over at brooke whos shaking her head outraged
everyone files out
as brooke is being led away she turns to elle
im not having an affair with enrique you know a delta gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong
i just liked watching him bend over to clean the f i lt e r
i believe you
brooke is taken away
elle in sweats and a pony tail pours over a mammoth sized deposition
a knock sounds
re the depo you done with that yet
elle hands the deposition over
ive read it twenty times
she grabs another one off of the stack and begins reading
i believe her too
i dont think shes having an affair with enrique
too bad you and i are the only ones
i m still cant believe you didnt tell donovan the alibi
elle looks up defensive
its not my alibi to tell interrupting i know
i thought that was very classy of you
sarah starts to go then stops
y have you ever noticed that donovan never asks warner to bring him coffee
hes asked me at least a dozen times
men are helpless
you know that
sarah lingers leaning on the edge of the couch
warner cant even do his own laundry
he has it sent out
did you know he got wait listed when he appli ed
his father had to make a call
stunned youre kidding
a knock sounds on the open door and margot and serena poke their heads in
oh my god
sarah watches as elle jumps up to hug the girls who each have a bottle of veuve cliquot in their hands
continuing whatre you doing here
were on our way to the bridal show in new york so we thought wed rescue you from law school for the night
tempting her we have a limo downstairs and lots more of these
she wiggles her champagne bottle
you guys i cant
were in the middle of a trial
confused at the office margot and serena look over at her
oh how sweet
you made friends with a nerdy girl
bring her too
to sarah cmon
you can wear one of elles outfits
t ha t s okay to elle speaking of which can you please put on some party clothes
you look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a k mart
torn i cant believe you guys are actually here but this case is important
ill make it up to you after finals okay
i really want to do a good job
margot and serena stare at her realizing she means it
call us if you change your mind
they start to head out
margot hands sa rah the bottle of champagne
she spots the rock on sarahs finger and grabs her hand
talk about a rock
you must be better in bed than you look
elle hustles them out the door
ill call you as soon as its over okay
she shuts the door behind them
then looks at sarah
continuing sorry about that
sarah sets down the veuve
she smiles at elle
continuing well drink it after we win
paulette arranges a nail polish display by the door
ive got a big one for you
paulette freezes and slowly turns to find ups guy holding out a big package
can you sign
he hands her the computerized tablet and as he does the pen velcroed to the side falls off
paulette watches as it falls in slo mo
realizing that now is the perfect time to try the bend snap
she bends slowly tush out knee cocked
she grabs the pen and as she prepares to snap back up ups guy leans over to help
continuing got it
not realizing hes leaning over she snaps back up clocking him in the nose with her head
he reels backward holding his nose blood flowing as paulette stares at him in horror
oh my god
elle waits in line for the water fountain talking on her cell phone
into phone you broke his nose
we intercut with paulette as she watches ups guy being carried out by paramedics on a gurney
the ladies of the shop flutter around him concerned
i m okay i think he noticed me elle sobbing but only because i maimed him
consoling ill be over right after the trial okay
were about to cross examine enrique
and dont worry
my friend serena barfed on a guy during the blair witch project and end up dating him for three months
she hangs up
enrique cuts in front of her in line for the water fountain
she glares at him tapping her foot
he finishes getting his drink and turns looking at her
dont stomp your little prada sandals at me miss thing
he walks past as
elle gapes at him
elle grabs emmetts arm as he whispers with donovan
enrique is gay
she grabs warner as hes passing
warner what kind of shoes do i have on
he looks down at her prada sandals
donovan frowns not seeing
what are you talking about
hes gay he isnt brookes lover
hes making it up
whoever killed heyworth is paying him off
how do you know hes gay
gay men know designers
straight men dont
she points at warner who shrugs
brooke leans over
whats going on
i m sure of it
he did leave a cher tape in the pool house once donovan scoffs
while i appreciate your masterful legal theory i have a murder trial to attend to
he grabs emmetts arm and pulls him aside as they confer on more serious matters
emmett looks at her as if to say sorry before he looks back at donovan
brooke looks at donovan then back at elle rolling her eyes
elle sits down pissed
warner is next to her
thanks for the backup
how was i supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on
she looks at him like hes a complete idiot as the judge takes his seat
donovan is in front of enrique who is at the stand
salvatore do you have any proof that you and mrs
windham were having an affair
just the love in my heart
women in the audience openly sigh
elle makes a puke gesture
donovan smiles a smug smile
if thats all the proof that he has your honor i think im done here
i have a couple of questions your honor
donovan glares at him
continuing sotto to donovan give me two minutes
he approaches enrique and starts firing questions at rapid speed
continuing did you ever take mrs
windham on a date
a restaurant in oakland
where no one would recognize us
and how long have you been sleeping with mrs
and what is your boyfriends name
the audience lets out a gasp
elle looks up shocked then delighted
enrique begins to sweat
continuing i m sorry i misunderstood
chuck is just a friend
chuck scrawny and angry stands up in the audience
if i m just your friend why have we been doing the slippy slap every night for the past six months
the courtroom erupts and the judge bangs the gavel
elle smiles victoriously from her seat
emmett grins back at her
donovan shakes his head smiling in amazement
elle and emmett walk down the stairs together in high spirits
donovan catches up
good work today ms
he walks on
she looks at emmett excited
he high fives her
paulette is closing up as elle follows her around
in a giddy rush and after they set his nose he came back for his truck and i offered to drive for him since he was still on pain killers
and we spent the whole afternoon together
he was unconscious for part of it but it was really fun
hugging paulette i m so happy for you
howd it go at the trial
donovan actually said the words good work ms
he takes me seriously
can you believe it
of course i can believe it
youre going to make a great lawyer
paulette looks at elle
continuing elle youve changed my life
you are the kindest most wonderful angel
without you i wouldnt have rufus or a dinner date
now go and share your goodness with the world while i stay here and have my hoo hoo waxed
elle passes sarah who carries a stack of depos into the conference room to dick and bobby
donovan asked to see you before you leave
hes already got his coffee maybe he needs a donut
they share a smile as elle walks over to donovans glass walled office and knocks on the door
come on in
he beckons her inside and she goes shutting the door behind her
hes behind his desk
he motions for her to sit in one of the two chairs opposite him
is everything okay
you followed your intuition today and you were right on target
i should ve listened
stunned thank you
ab ou t the alibi she sighs i m sorry but cutting her off i m impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it
thats what makes a good lawyer
and on top of that you gained the clients trust and kept it
that s what makes a great lawyer
youre smart elle
most of the guys i have on my payroll
elle is overwhelmed by his praise
that means so much to me to hear you say that
donovan walks around his desk and sits in the chair opposite her
i think its time discuss your career path
have you thought about where you might be a summer associate
still overwhelmed not really
i know how competitive it
a l l is he smiles
you know what competition is really about dont you
eager for his knowledge elle is on the edge of her seat
he leans in
continuing its about ferocity
balancing human intelligence with animal diligence
knowing exactly what you want and how far youll go to get it
how far will elle go
as he says the last sentence he slides his hand up her sarah walks down the hallway glancing in donovans office to see donovans hand sliding up elles skirt
she shakes her head in disgust heads off not seeing elle stares at donovan in horror then grabs his hand stopping its journey upward
upset youre hitting on me
youre a beautiful girl elle
so everything you just said
i m a man who knows what i want
elle rises stung
she stares at him for a beat
and i m a law student whos finally realized her professor is a pathetic asshole
she walks out
calling out too bad
i thought you were a law student who wanted to be a lawyer
elle keeps walking
elle is in the elevator
flushed and upset
as the doors start to close sarah sticks her arm in blocking them
you almost had me fooled
maybe you should sleep with the judge too
then we can win the case
sarah steps back letting the doors shut
elle stomps out of the elevator as emmett gets in
smiling he y im quitting
she marches past
he follows catching up
law school was a mistake
getting this internship was a mistake
whatre you talking about
you earned it she snorts
i didnt earn anything
i got this internship because donovan liked the way i looked
which he made clear
tonight when he tried to feel me up
emmett looks pissed as he processes this
mind reeling so now youre
going back to la
maybe i can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the swedish bikini team
no more navy blue suits
no more panty hose
no more trying to be something i m not
what if youre trying to be something you are
the hell with donovan
she stops giving him a sad smile
thanks for not treating me the way everyone else here does
call me if youre ever in california
she walks out
emmett watches her go hating it
elles boxster packed with suitcases and the potted palm pulls up
elle sits in front of paulette dejected
not even bothering with a manicure
upset you cant go home
whats the point of staying
all people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs
no ones ever going to take me seriously
the people at law s chool dont warner doesnt i dont even think my parents take me seriously
they wanted me to grow up and become a victorias secret model who marries a rock star
now for the first time it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living
but i was kidding mys elf donovan didnt see me as a lawyer
he saw me as a piece of ass
just like everyone else
it turns out i am a j oke
she stands up
continuing the hell with law school
i just came to say goodbye
professor elspeth stromwell spins around nails drying facing elle
if you let one stupid prick ruin your life youre not the girl i thought you were
elle looks at her shocked as professor stromwell stands and goes
close on a tv donovan is being interviewed is on the evening news
enrique salvatore has been discredited as a witness
did you go in there knowing how you were going to discredit mr
its a little thing i like to call strategy
he gives the reporters a smug smile
brooke looks away from the tv
emmett is next to her prepping her for the following day
is he always such an ass
containing himself hes the top defense attorney in the state
of course hes an ass
j but is he an ass thats gonna win my case
hes an ass thats gonna try
he thinks i m guilty doesnt he
thats not whats important
to me it is
he doesnt trust me
why should i trust him
emmett thinks for a moment
then looks at brooke
why should you
reporters set up their cameras
dorky david passes by in a suit and tie
donovan and emmett head into the courtroom
keep that bitch away from me
shes our client
blatantly pissed funny how a woman can turn into a bitch just by saying no
donovan glares at emmett as they continue in
behind them sarah stops in her tracks having heard all of this
donovan takes his seat next to brooke
she smiles at him
whatre you so happy about
youre on trial for murder
i have new representation
the door of the courtroom bangs open and elle strides in dressed in a prada mini dress underdog in her purse
she blows a bubble lets it pop then sets her briefcase down next to donovans
to donovan excuse you
youre in my way
she nudges him aside
donovan looks at brooke
shes a law student
she cant defend you
dorky david steps up holding out a marked casebook
massachusetts supreme judicial court rule
to donovan see
counselors approach the bench
elle starts to head up
youre not going up there
yes i am
to donovan i dont think you heard me
shes my lawyer
all of you
elle donovan and emmett head up as does the da
elle hands the judge the case book
elle woods your honor
rule of the supreme judicial court states that a law student may appear on behalf of a defendant in criminal proceedings
stoked i have no problem with this
im not allowing it
pointedly but you agreed last night
in the office
when we were discussing my career
the implication lingers in the air as donovan glares at her
reading the casebook the ruling also states that you need a licensed attorney to supervise you
that i wont agree to
emmett steps forward
i m supervising your honor
elle smiles at him
donovan looks from emmett to elle completely derailed
well then ms
elle walks back to the table with a grin
warner looks shocked
paulette beams the ups guy in the nose brace next to her
serena and margot now in attendance stand clapping and squealing in a completely inappropriate way
donovan takes a seat in the audience
as he passes by brooke enjoy prison
the judge looks at brooke
windham you do realize what youre doing
as donovan sits margot leans over
dont fuck with a delta gamma
sarah leans forward to elle who gathers her notes
kick some butt
elle looks at her surprised
woods call your first witness
id like to recall chutney windham as a defense witness
the crowd murmurs
donovan rolls his eyes
chutney takes her hand off of the bible and sits
woods begin your questioning
first your honor i d like to point out that not only is there no proof in this case but theres a complete lack of mens rea which by definition
tells us that there is no crime without a vicious will
the da rolls her eyes as do the lawyers present
i am aware of the meaning of mens rea
what i am unaware of is why youre giving me a vocabulary lesson instead of questioning your witness
flustered elle turns to chutney
windham when you uh arrived back at the house
was your father there
not that i saw
but like i said i went straight upstairs to take a shower
and when you came downstairs what happened
i saw brooke standing over his body drenched in his blood
windham didnt have a gun
no shed stashed it by then
brooke rolls her eyes
move to strike that from the record your honor
elle mentally kicks herself for not doing this herself
eirimett gives her a reassuring nod
she takes a deep breath then continues on
did you hear a shot fired
revision pink a
i was in the shower
so at some point in the twenty minutes
you were in the shower your father was shot
elle paces a bit
underdog watches from her purse on the table intrigued by her line of questioning
your father was shot while you were in the shower
gerard looks at emmett
wheres she going with this
have a little faith
but you didnt hear the shot because you were in the shower
i was washing my hair
elles onto something but not sure what
miss windham can you tell us what youd been doing earlier in the day
i got up went to starbucks went to the gym got a perm and came home
where you got in the shower
i believe the witness has made it clear that she was in the shower
people start to murmur
sarah looks worried
yes your honor
had you ever gotten a
perm before miss windham
the beginnings of a smile start to spread across elles face
revision pink a
how many would you say
two a year since i was twelve
you do the math
you know a girl in my sorority tracy marcinko got a perm once
even though we all told her not to curls really werent the right look for her chummy she didnt have your bone structure
chutney almost smiles
continuing but thankfully that same day she entered the pi kap wet t shirt contest where she was completely hosed down from head to toe
donovan shakes his head at her incompetence
why is this relevant
emmett clears his throat worried
elle turns around giving him a trust me look
then turns back to the judge
to the judge i have a point
then make it
elle looks at chutney
chutney why is it that tracy marcinkos curls were ruined when she got hosed down
because they got wet
because isnt the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twenty four hours after getting a perm at the risk
of de activating the ammonium thiglycolate
yes elle continues
and wouldnt someone whos had thirty perms
throughout her lifetime be well aware of this rule
chutney doesnt answer
she just glares at brooke
continuing and if you in fact were not washing your hair as i suspect you were not since your curls are still intact wouldnt you have heard the gunshot
chutney continues to glare
continuing and if you in fact heard the gunshot then brooke windham wouldnt have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs
which would mean that you wouldve had to have found mrs
windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible
isnt that right
shes younger than i am
did she tell you that
how would you feel if your father married someone younger than you
you however had time to hide the gun didnt you chutney
after you shot your father
brooke looks at chutney in horror realizing
i didnt mean to shoot him to brooke i meant to shoot you
the gavel pounds
i knew it
elle looks at emmet t
elated at whats just happened
shocked oh my god
even more shocked oh my g d
reporters mob elle and brooke as they make their way out of the courtroom
elle how did you know chutney was lying
because she is brilliant
humble the rules of haircare are simple and finite
any cosmo girl would ve known
the reporters laugh as they snap pictures of her and a happy brooke
clos e on the tv the channels change golf a commercial elle in the courthouse
daniel elle s father watches tv as he does his morning workout on the treadmill
proud biles on tv
he looks next to him where sapphire is upside down on a yoga inversion machine
sapphires pov the upside down television with elle on it
oh my god
what happened to her tan
as the reporters continue to mob brooke elle steps aside to talk to serena and margot
i wish we could stay longer but i have a game
i cant believe youre a laker girl
youre like a lawyer
grinning not yet
enid walks up to the girls
to elle even though you knew your shit today youre still a product of the patriarchy and a creation of the male dominated media
and so are your friends
she looks at serena
continuing to serena although youre kinda hot
she walks off
serena looks alarmed
hugging them dont worry
ill see you guys soon
thanks for coming
she air kisses them as margot leads a still shell shocked serena away as emmett walks up to elle
elle looks up at the courthouse as the sun sets behind it
she smiles proud of herself
you were amazing today
she turns and finds warner
he moves closer
it made me realize something
i m an idiot
he turns on the charm
i want to be with you elle
he pulls her close hand around her waist kissing her
she looks up at him a trace of the old love in her eyes
for a moment she melts
i want to be with you too warner
after a moment she steps back removing his hand from her waist and wrenching it behind his back
on opposing sides
shocked are you serious
looks like i am
she walks down the steps
warner watches her go then turns to see sarah whos witnessed the entire episode
she glares at him then walks past
sarah hold on
she shoves him knocking him on his ass then rushes to
catch up with elle
calling out el le wait up elle turns
continu ing sheepish i m a bitch
yes you are
and donovans a scumbag for coming on to you
yes he is
they look at each other in a silent truce
so can we drink that champagne when i get back from the pawnshop
she pulls off her engagement ring
youre pawning the rock
weve got finals to study for
she smiles and heads off
elle smiles processing this as em me tt approaches elle
up for a celebration dinner
are you asking me on a date
as long as you realize im not just some man toy you can show off like a trophy
joking then forget it
besides i have an early class tomorrow
so friday at eight
she smiles at him
she heads down the stairs stops and thinks a moment then runs back up grabbing emmett in a hellacious kiss
he kisses her back
we crane up as they embrace on the courthouse steps
welcome law students class of banners hang over orientation tables
nervous first year students stand in line
we pan across a row of club tables passing harvard law
journal and environmental law association until we reach a table that proudly bears the banner of blonde legal defense club
elle in a red l t shirt stands behind the table straightening some flyers
underdog is plopped down on top of the stack
elle turns to see emmett next to her
re underdog someone missed you
is he the only one
what do you think
continuing re the crowd looks like youre pretty popular
elle smiles turning back as a nervous l girl steps up
do you have to be blonde to sign up
only blonde at heart
to the girl next to her right
elle smiles and looks down at the newly blonde sarah
sarah returns the smile as we pull back to see a crowd of first year girls gathered around elles table rushing to sign up
ready to be as blonde as they can be
