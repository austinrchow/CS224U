merlin smacks a fly that has landed on his head
shrek and artie stare in astonishment
now can i interest anyone in a snack or beverage
merlin offers up a baking dish full of rocks

merlin takes a bite and chews loudly
his gums are bleeding from eating rocks

a fire blazes
merlin throws a handful of dirt into the fire it flares
now all of you look into the fire of truth and tell me what you see
wild war cry woo looo looo looo
he points at the smoke and it starts to form objects i
puss and donkey excited sit by the fire
okay i see a dutch fudge torte with cinnamon swirls

shrek glances at the fire
the stroller from his nightmare begins to take shape in the smoke
he blows the image away
he covers his fear and changes the subject
i see a rainbow pony
shrek the third final screening script
this is lame
merlin whacks artie on the back of the head
now just go for it
he tosses more dirt and flames burst up
artie studies it
theres a baby bird and a father bird sitting in a nest
merlin starts beating a drum
arties expression starts to change as he stays focused

why did he leave the little bird all alone
shrek starts to take this in as he watches
artie gets more worked up
its trying to fly but it doesnt know how to

as the smoke drifts away he looks and sees everyone else staring back at him stunned
whew proper head case you are arent you

merlin goes back inside
they all stare at artie
shrek the third final screening script

donkey gives shrek a nudge to go over and talk to artie

they all turn toward the shack where merlin peeks out
loud over the music just thought i might help set the mood
yknow for your big heart to heart chat
everyone stares at him
he sheepishly turns off the device and shuts the door
its quiet again
i know what its like to not feel ready for something
artie looks at him
even ogres get scared
you know once in a while
i know you want me to be king but i cant
im not cut out for it and i never will be alright
shrek takes this in
even my own dad knew i wasnt worth the trouble
he dumped me at that school the first chance he got and i never heard from him again
shrek the third final screening script
my dad wasnt really the fatherly type either
well i doubt he was worse than mine
my father was an ogre
he tried to eat me
artie looks at shrek
now i guess i should have seen it coming
he used to give me a bath in barbecue sauce and put me to bed with an apple in my mouth
artie chuckles at this
i guess thats
artie laughs and then pokes at the fire
you know it may be hard to believe what with my obvious charm and good looks but people used to think that i was a monster
and for a long time i believed them
artie looks up at shrek
but after awhile you learn to ignore the names that people call you and you just trust who you are
artie gently pokes at the embers with a stick for a moment
you know youre okay shrek
he tosses the stick into the fire
you just need to do a little less yelling and use a little more soap
shrek the third final screening script
the soaps because you stink
i got that
the camera slowly booms up and away from the group as the fire continues to burn
the princesses fiona and the queen are surrounded by darkness as they tiptoe down the steps and into the catacombs below the castle
they round a corner and step onto a ledge with fiona leading the way holding a torch
oh this place is filthy
i feel like a hobo
fiona tries to keep her frustration in check
im sorry but this just isnt working for me
sleeping beauty still being carried by doris wakes up
everythings always about you isnt it
its not like your attitude is helping snow
well maybe it just bothers you that i was voted fairest in the land

oh give me a break
gesturing toward hair shrek the third final screening script
snow white contd rapunzel rapunzel let down thy golden extensions
ladies let go of your petty complaints and lets work together
snow white and rapunzel share an indignant look
fiona travels deeper into the catacombs
the other princesses follow
so i guess the plan is we just wander aimlessly in this stink hole until we rot
no were gonna get inside and find out what charmings up to
i know hes a jerk and everything but i gotta admit that charming makes me hotter than july
finally fiona spots what she was looking for
fiona the queen and the princesses run towards a long ladder and climb up through a grate into the main castle courtyard
they peer around a corner and see the construction of an outdoor theater is underway
two stagehands walk by carrying a large dragon set piece

they burst through the doors and see prince charming holding rapunzel by the arm
charming let go of her
a large group of armed far far away guards surround them
prince charming smiles at fiona
but why would i want to do that
he looks back at rapunzel lovingly and the two share a long kiss
fiona and the other princesses are shocked
say hello ladies to the new queen of far far away
cinderella claps excitedly
the princesses stare her down
rapunzel how could you
prince charming eyes up the princesses
shrek the third final screening script

shrek will be back soon charming and youll be sorry
he stops and flashes a sadistic smile
dont you realize once shrek sets foot in far far away hes doomed
prince charming leads rapunzel out
she looks back at them apologetically
everyone wears a look of defeat
the guards march them off
fiona and the princesses are locked away in a prison cell
fiona looks through the bars of the cell feeling helpless
shrek startles awake
he sits up and scratches his head looking around
he realizes its morning
behind him a peaceful bird lands on a tree branch
suddenly the tree branch that was holding the bird flicks it off
shrek senses the movement behind him and turns around to find everything is normal
he turns back around to wake up everyone
the trees start to advance toward shrek
the log artie is sleeping on suddenly sits up knocking artie who is still asleep to the ground
shrek the third final screening script
the tree turns around to reveal an evil tree
donkey finally wakes up
the evil trees continue to advance
a piano is heard
the trees part and hook is revealed to be playing the piano
the music builds to a dramatic finale
captain hook turns away from his keys and faces them
theyve got a piano

except the fat one
he stares hard at shrek and aims his hooked prosthetic
king charming has something special in mind for you ogre
shrek is perplexed
pirates charge forward swinging in from the tree branches
one lands and gets his peg leg stuck in the ground
the pirates close in
shrek grabs one and throws him to the side
one pirate raises his sword and prepares to swing at artie
shrek pushes arties head down and the sword narrowly misses him
the pirate prepares to swing again and shrek lifts artie above his head
shrek the third final screening script
still in the air artie uses both legs to kick the pirate to the ground
shrek and artie share a satisfied look
a pirate charges donkey
puss draws his sword and begins fighting off the pirate protecting donkey
the camera pans across the back of the piano to reveal merlin happily playing along with captain hook
he notices and rudely elbows merlin out of the way
a pirate runs at shrek only to be tripped by artie
the pirate bounces off shreks belly
ready the plank
a wooden board is thrown on a stump creating a makeshift plank
the pirates back shrek onto the plank
several pirates with swords force shrek onto the plank
he is backed up to the edge of the plank and falls into a waiting treasure chest below
several pirates try to shut the lid on him
puss donkey and artie are trying to hold off the villains
suddenly two evil trees come into frame and scoop puss donkey and artie up in a net
the pirates aim the cannon at puss donkey and artie
artie starts to panic
puss extracts his claws and tries to cut through the netting
the cannon fuse is lit
shrek bursts open the treasure chest and stands up with the chest still stuck to his behind
shrek the third final screening script
shrek sees the lit fuse and quickly formulates a plan
he grabs two pirates and shoves them into the treasure chest
he tosses the chest onto the other end of the plank and catapults himself over to the cannon
at the last second shrek is able to aim the cannon in the opposite direction
the cannon fires and hits captain hooks piano blowing it into pieces
realizing their defeat the evil trees drop the netting that holds donkey puss and artie
the evil trees and pirates take off running
captain hook turns and sees his army running off
he shakes his hook in the air
what has charming done with fiona
shes gonna get whats coming to her
he raises his hook threateningly but it gets caught on an evil trees branch and is dragged away with the rest of the villains
and there aint nothing you can do to stop him
tight on shrek filled with worry
nothing else matters to him now
artie puss and donkey run over to shrek
weve got to save her
but shes so far far away
shrek thinks for a moment

merlin is sitting cross legged deep in meditation
