screenplay by james mangold and steven rogers based on a story by steven rogers close up ornate antique grandfather clock strikes
the credits begin to roll
calligraphy place cards are painstakingly hand written in preparation for a formal reception
servants meticulously clean an elaborate crystal chandelier
hands rapidly shine silver cutlery
fresh flowers arranged in several enormous vases
kitchen clock strikes
steaming copper pots boiling over
platters prepared with decorative garnish
extravagant tiered cake is lavishly iced
a glob of frosting enters a pair of puckered lips
the perpetrator a fey pompous head valet seriously considers the texture and flavor of the icing then gives the pastry chef a withering sour look
the valet oblivious to the chefs fury gathers a prepared silver breakfast tray and checks his pocket watch
antique bedside table clock just past
the valet throws open velvet drapes sunlight floods the room revealing a figure sleeping soundly in a massive oak framed bed
the valet puts down the tray pulls back the quilt
the dozing figure gives the valet a deliberate angry kick
flinching infinitesimally the valet crosses to the closet selects three suits and holds them up for inspection
from beneath the puffiest of pillows an eye reluctantly opens
a weary arm points decisively to the riding outfit
the riding outfit is adorned by leopold duke of albany a dashing virile man in his s
galloping with great abandon he expertly leads his horse up hills and over hedges
he sends gardeners shaping the grounds fleeing from his path
in the background lanterns are being strung throughout the estate
rugs are beaten out of open windows
large hallway clock
a pair of boots track a freshly scrubbed floor as leopold heads carelessly up the stairway
three steps behind the valet snaps his fingers signaling the staff to clean up the mess
gaudily framed portraits of somber relations
a bird sits listless in a gilded cage
hot water is poured into a bath
carriages begin to arrive
orchestra leader signals the musicians to play
guests fill the ballroom in formal attire
leopold stares haughtily into a full length mirror
he wears only dotted linen drawers and a black silk top hat of the period
he flexes slightly
the valet hastily fastens a corset around his mid section from behind
leopold eyes his reflection seductively
he becomes bored
he turns to his right
the valet spoons sorbet from a silver saucer into his mouth
he turns back to the mirror to watch himself eat
the valet pats his mouth dry
he affects a pampered strut crossing the room as the valet sprays a mixture of perfume and powder into the air
leopold thrusts out his arms walking through the mist turns and saunters back to his favorite place in front of the mirror
finally as if weighing a great decision leopold hands his hat to his valet and nods firmly into the mirror
fine linen undervest slides over his head
black twilled worsted trousers pulled up to his waist
the buttoning of his hard white roll collar
a cream suede glove stitched in black slides over his hand
a perfect tight bow tie is tied around his neck
an elegant black tuxedo jacket with silk facings and tails to the knees is fitted to his torso
his hair is sleeked with oil and centrally parted
his eyebrows are brushed with a tiny silver comb
his cheeks are pinched
a red silk handkerchief is placed in the bosom of his lapel
leopold stares into the mirror
the effect is dazzling
he raises one eyebrow
then in a voice you could pour over a waffle you dance like a herd of cattle miss fairchild
you are a rare woman who lights up the room
simply by leaving it
as he rises the reflection of leopolds uncle otto a pampered effectual man in his s appears behind leopold in the looking glass
tell me leopold do you plan to join us downstairs after completing this one sided flash of wit
i despise affairs of this sort uncle otto
no one really listens to anyone else
if you attempt it you will see why
you judge everything too severely
i wonder what would happen if you were to cast that critical eye inward
you do not wonder at all
you merely ask in order to state your own opinion
we are all concerned about you
ahh here it comes
your life does not seem to have any direction
at the age of a man is too young to do anything well
at he is too old
now is your time to take action
tell me what is it you want to do with your life
wearily i do not know
just as weary your ignorance cramps my conversation
he slaps leopolds face twice rather quickly wake up
this is your one and only life
every man has the chance to make a difference
leopold stung takes a moment to compose himself
i am most grateful for your surveillance and for your sympathy
i assure you there is no need for concern
i am as effectual and attentive
as my position allows
life is not position leopold
it is action
he straightens leopolds tie i will see you downstairs promptly
in the appropriate frame of mind
leopold stares into the mirror snaps his fingers
the valet hands him a glass and pours a small shot of brandy
leopold shoots him a look
the valet fills the glass higher
leopold drains the glass and heads to the doorway
he hesitates taking a deep breath and a long pause
grandly go spread joy
without looking back leopold leaves the room
music fills the air as the creme de la creme of victorian society gather inside
leopold holds a prearranged dance card
he looks at the names and finds his first partner is miss tree
leopold looks upward helplessly at an unrelenting god
a profoundly self conscious leopold dances energetically into frame with miss tree an ancient elfin yet amazingly spry woman who gapes up at him searchingly unblinking
leopold opens his mouth to speak can think of nothing suitable to say and clamps his mouth shut
they dance out of frame
leopold dances into frame with clara a beautiful girl of
he glances at her and smiles
she titters turning away shyly
they whirl around the dance floor
his smile grows into a broad grin
caught up in the excitement clara beams up at him
happily revealing a mouth full of missing inky teeth
leopold face frozen in a formal smile dances on
leopold lumbers into frame with miss fairchild a woman of immense girth
with great dignity and extreme difficulty he maneuvers her around the floor looking everywhere except her enormous bosom
you dance like an angel miss fairchild
you light up the room
i thank you
miss fairchild curtseys heavily
leopold glances at his card sees the name miss serena clacket and shudders
he spots a very lovely woman hidden amongst the guests
she scribbles in a small note pad occasionally glancing around
hiding his dance card he saunters over
i do not believe i have had the pleasure
the young woman stares vacantly at leopold until she realizes he is addressing her
she puts her pad away
leopold takes her hand and kisses it gently
will you excuse me
slightly tipsy you are not from the area are you
smiles and shakes her head no are you
this is my estate
looking around the room well its not home but its much
leopold regards her curiously
the orchestra starts up
there is a hubbub amongst the guests
the ta ra ra boom de ay
oh thats from paris isnt it
it is a scandal nonetheless
leopold spots uncle otto observing him from across the room
miss carlson do me the honor
im afraid im not much of a dancer
smiling seductively truly i would be in your debt
any admonition would be erased simply by presenting a partner as lovely as yourself
leopold stiffly holds out his arm
carlson stuck takes it with hesitation and is escorted to the dance floor
all but leopold and carlson gaily sing ta ra ra boom de ay
leopold flushed looks quite smitten
carlson shy at first eventually smiles brightly
i suppose we really ought to sing along
embarrassed oh golly
they half sing half speak the ta ra ra boom de ay their emphasis on boom
laughing giddily their dancing becomes freer picking up speed
the room spins
finally breathless thank you for the dance
it was lovely
i hope it wasnt too awful for you
not at all
it was most enlightening
there is a slight pause
the grandfather clock strikes midnight
i really must be going
i wont hear of it
moving away from him no im quite late as it is
i shall see you to the door
stopping him resolutely youre very sweet
i had a wonderful time
she watches him memorizing his face
then firmly goodbye
leopold takes a glass of champagne from a passing waiter
he watches carlson pass through the crowd and out the courtyard door
he surveys the room
after a moment he follows her
leopold makes his way through the manicured garden in the dark
he hears an eerie metallic sound
he slows down brushes back the thicket
the silhouette of a woman is revealed
she is once again writing in her notebook
carlson spins around quickly panicked
partially hidden in the brush a sleek oddly shaped mechanical device
its door open lit from within casting a weird glow
what are you
you frightened me
leopold moves toward the contraption and is about to touch it
what sort of mechanism is this
carlson shakes her head unsure of how to proceed
its perfectly all right
leopold carefully examines the apparatus stepping inside
carefully deliberately listen to me
move very slowly
step out of the machine
step out and ill explain whatever you want to know
what is this
who are you
his hand comes to rest on a glowing red lever
she yanks on his arm
instinctively he pulls away accidentally thrusting the lever into action
carlson falls from the machine
suddenly frantic get out of there
get out now
the machine lights up
the compartment door snaps shut
there is a bright white flash
blackness fills the screen
the compartment door slides open revealing dr
kau s an asian doctor with a thick brooklyn accent
her face full of enthusiasm drops as she sees the unconscious leopold
she turns to her co workers warning them
she looks back at leopold
her co workers dr
plodder austere authoritative dr
drake muddled and timid peer inside the compartment door
everybody stay calm
lock the front door
drake and kau make a move to inspect an unconscious leopold
no no no
you mustnt touch him
the consequences could be catastrophic
he could be hurt or even dead
they approach leopold
kau finds carlsons note pad on the ground next to leopold
she reads the last entry
but im stuck and its only a dance and he is the seventh duke of albany
they all look at one another then back at leopold
racing from the room give me a minute
katherine coles a radiant workaholic types frenetically into the computer while talking on the phone trying hard not to sound upset
people fall in love they have to climb back out
she laughs but she is not smiling so what
well just be friends now right
she stops typing and listens for a while
she runs her hand through her hair
well i appreciate your honesty
using her middle finger she pushes up her glasses no
ill just think of this as surviving another dating accident
take care or good luck or whatever im supposed to
the line goes dead
plodder bursts in
kate sees his distress and instantly becomes very centered
rising thats impossible
she wasnt supposed to return until
something went wrong
he hands her carlsons note pad
slowly she sits down
the th duke
all business reading from a printout of albany
he was the
is the son of emery and eliza
he was of no actual importance until he vanished at the turn of the century without a trace
it was a sensation
in the s they even made a movie about him
the tenuous duke with ronald coleman
absently i love ronald coleman
despite much speculation and a nation wide investigation a body was never found
he was never heard from again
there is a stunned silence
they stare at leopold in awe
weve altered the course of history
we never should have started this
what are we going to do
we cant keep him here
imagine if anyone found out
now no one would believe such a stupid mistake could be made because no one would believe any of this is possible
we fix this
we keep this to ourselves and we fix it
they all nod in agreement
kau research all our data
st priority locate carlson
drake determine the reciprocal correlations connected to the th century
work hours a day if necessary
in the meantime
one of us will have to take charge of him
she forces back panic
only the tremor in her voice gives her away
this is a major scientific opportunity
it doesnt get any better than this
researching the behavior the physical and emotional characteristics of a century ago
utilizing technology available to us today
hes a gold mine
hes a man kate
not a guinea pig
and while hes here hes ours
no one moves
well draw names
whoever is is picked will be responsible
they nod reluctantly
drake writes out names and throws them in a cup
the silence becomes deafening
finally ill do it
all the scientists face her
youll look after him
no i meant ill pick the name
she reaches in
they wait with mounting suspense
finally she turns to kate
the scientists follow her gaze
he blinks at the group
what has happened
the doctors caught off guard smile benignly
they surround leopold as a group not knowing where to begin
finally your grace
weee aaare a smaaall part of a laaarge research team
a project funded by the government of the united states
regarding their appearance with distaste oh
for the past six and a half years weve been conducting scientific experiments on density and flexibility in the dimensions of time and space
quite by accident we came upon a formula utilizing tachyons
particles traveling faster than the speed of light which allowed us to
fold time so to speak
bend it between the cracks of the dimensions
they all laugh nervously
leopold does not
now while that wasnt the original purpose of our experiment we opted to pursue it well privately on our own
borrowing funds already provided
we journeyed to your time because it was the quickest path to follow
we debated long and hard whether we should use this knowledge at all
believe me it was never our intent to disturb the past
merely to discover if the expedition were possible
as your presence here confirms
we are very disturbed
leopold nods at them as if they are insane
the problem facing us is not only how to get you back but when you see
we certainly dont want to miscalculate
send you to a different era entirely
leopold starts to speak
rest assured no harm will come to you
youll be well looked after by dr
i do not follow
what do you mean get me back home
where am i
leopold looks carefully around the room for the first time modern mechanical equipment data shifting and changing giant cooling devices bright neon lighting
the doctors are silent
slowly would you have me believe
i am being detained at present in the hereafter
the time to come
carefully it is the year nineteen hundred and ninety five
leopold leaps up
the doctors follow him around the room
all of you
this is impossible
leopold calm down
a voyage through time
what do you take me for
did you bring me here by force
were scientist not seditionists
truly panicked let me out of here
i wont stand for this another moment
hes out the door
leopold moves quickly fearfully through the darkly lit hallway the doctors close behind
you dont know what youre doing
just listen to what we have to say
it is too late
leopold throws open the door and runs upstairs
modern day pedestrians
leopold stands frozen overwhelmed taking it all in
the doctors reach him
he collapses to the ground
kate and dr
kau talk quietly
leopold tightly holding onto his seat and the back door gazes out the window in utter disbelief
i remember reading they ate a lot of squab
do you have a squab
on the verge of panic i dont know
pull yourself together
turning to leopold are you all right back there
leopold trembling gapes at the sights every day sounds magnified
perspiration runs down the side of his face
kate watches him in her rear view mirror
youre going to be fine you know
theres nothing to worry about
i have everything under control
kau stares at kate in concerned silence
quietly to dr
kau well never get away with this
leopold awakens alone in his room
he sits up with a jolt
his stomach sinks as he realizes this is no dream
he slowly rises to his full stature moving to the window he looks out on the modern day city shaking his head in awe
he makes his way to the bedroom door and tentatively touches the knob
there is a knock on the door
leopold jumps back and runs to the bed the picture of dignity
how are you feeling
no response i thought you might like some tea
i insist on being returned home immediately
were doing our best
i wish to speak with your employer dr
youre speaking to him
you are not suggesting that you are dr
if you like you could call me miss dr
coles or if thats too much how about just plain kate
coldly a woman of science
hard to believe
but a womans brain cannot obtain enough knowledge to posses a truly scientific mind
jotting this down interesting
nevertheless weve come a long way baby
confused are you attempting to be humorous
im attempting to be informative its just coming out humorous
leopold regards her dubiously
clinically look modern social science clearly states that a womans place in society marks the level of that civilization
a science career for a woman is now almost as acceptable as being a
cream and sugar
young lady i
surely it is not expected that i remain here with you indefinitely
pen poised does that make you nervous
writing then what are you getting so red about
its a very large apartment
with locks on all the doors
my dear miss coles
she puts the pad down lets get one thing straight right now
my name is kate or katherine or if you insist dr
she rises take a good long look leopold
i am a th century american woman with a doctorate and a commission and independence
i am not your young lady or your pretty miss or your honey
is that clear
leopold watches her with great interest
for the tea
ill get it for you
kate grabs the teacup grandly and leaves the room
kate rummages through every drawer shelf and cupboard searching for the honey
finally she spots the honeybear and squeezes honey a tad to violently into the tea
she tries posing confidently then checks her reflection in the toaster
kate returns confidently with the tea and a plastic smile
has it been decided what it is i am to do while i am being held here
oh just some laundry the cooking a little light housework
leopold doesnt react
clearing her throat i took the liberty of preparing a simple schedule to efficiently utilize your time while incorporating you into my routine
she hands him a schedule as you can see my day begins with meditation and yoga from to
she moves in close to him making leopold uncomfortable
you will arise at shower and change and at we breakfast together
we begin the days work
kau arrives to observe you in your natural routine as i research the data that will enable you to return home
at we lunch together
you answer a daily questionnaire i type up my notes
at precisely you will enjoy minutes of free time then at i listen to tom brokaw while making dinner as you write down any questions that come up during your
at we dine together
if you need me at any time you may ring this bell
she rings a tiny dinner bell
he is about to speak
now mondays and wednesdays i have computer science class tuesdays i have therapy
if i have a date im usually home by
during these periods you may read any of the books ive picked out for you in your room
i organize my next days work at david letterman im in bed
she takes a breath smiles at him next day we begin again
after a beat with great dignity at what time shall i wee and pooh
kate is forced into a stunned silence
our chaperone is here
for the past two years
charlie can never know about this project
well tell him you are a
overly distinguished colleague staying here as our guest
which would explain your lack of familiarity with our customs and so forth aghast make yourself comfortable
ill check in on you later
i think this is going very well dont you
leopold looks at her blankly
if you need anything just ring
kate tinkles the bell fumbles for the knob and heads out
still on leopold
screaming just as loud what
still shouting come here i wanna talk to you
leopold listens at the door
he slowly opens it takes two steps out peers around the corner then quickly steps back in
he takes a deep frightened breath and slowly deflates
charlie sits on the couch smoking a cigarette surrounded by his paintings
he is a likable twentysomething with a big mouth
what did i do
removing his coffee from the table setting it on a coaster rings
and what did i say about you smoking in the house
you were against it
youre back early
she takes away his cigarette hey
are you all right
you look funny
funny ha ha or funny odd
that all depends
how was your trip
if it was good ill tell you the truth
if it was rotten ill have to butter you up first
butter me up
have you been working out
no im really starting to see results
are you comfortable there on the couch
cause youll be sleeping there the next few nights
you have to be out of here by and you cant be back before
we have an important man working with us with very unusual needs
the company is insisting he stay here
what about a hotel
this man requires around the clock attention
i meant for me
thank you charlie
she kisses his forehead i owe you one
you owe me nine
what am i supposed to do all day
as if having an epiphany you could get a job
kate the entire point of being an artist is that i dont have to work
who is this guy
well i cant tell you much because
im not allowed to discuss what goes on at the office
well im not
anyway it might be interesting to have someone else to talk to
it gets so quiet around here sometimes i feel like ive gone deaf
does he have a label
is he anything like his name
hes exactly like his name
then you owe me ten
leopold peeks around the entrance to the living room
confident its unoccupied he majestically walks inside up to date gadgetry charlies modern art work bright fashionable furniture
his eyes come to rest on the television set
the on off buttons loom large
he looks around the room then brazenly presses the button instantly regis and kathy lee loudly berate each other before an excited crowd
leopold jumps back several feet hands flailing in front of him as if shooing away a bee
he quickly yet cautiously slams the power off
he quickly scurries out the hallway
he stops abruptly
he remains very still
composing himself he turns and deliberately faces the room
after a moment he purposefully steps back inside
he makes a large arc around the television set is confronted by one of charlies sculptures and makes an arc around that
he finds himself in front of a light switch and gingerly examines it
as he does track lighting illuminates the room
he looks at the lights then back at the switch
he flicks the lights on and off trying to figure out the precise moment in the transfer of power laughing in spite of himself
kate and charlie enter
they watch leopold flicking the lights laughing like a madman
charlie gives kate a look
explaining hes from canada
leopold sits at the head of the table kate and charlie banished to either side
leopold chews his dinner incessantly
finally what is this
its called hamburger helper
it is beyond help
please serve the next course
he pushes his plate away
im afraid there is no next course
if you make a list of the foods you like ill pick them up at the store for you
is all food here this
please understand i am used to a different sort of preparation
where i come from a proper meal is the result of reflection and study
a recipe is merely a theme which an intelligent cook can plan each time with variation
charlie gives kate a look
several courses are served
menus are often prepared days in advance timed to perfection
it is said without the culinary art the crudeness of reality would make life unbearable
after a beat
firmly in canada
we have a saying here
shake and shake the catsup bottle none will come and then a lotll
he pours catsup on his dinner
since youre such an expert on fine cuisine why dont you make dinner tomorrow night
it should be obvious to you that i am not a domestic
you may take my plate
i have my own thank you
who died and made me cinderella
young man there is a distinct impertinence to your voice
its part of my charm
changing the subject leopold
since youre our guest here there are several cultural events you might enjoy seeing
charlie has season tickets to the ball game
perhaps youd like to take that in
what is it
what is it
or the opera or the ballet
what is it
charlie theres no rule that says everyone has to be interested in baseball
no but i believe there is a rule that says everyone has to have heard of it
coles your brother charles attitude and demeanor are unacceptable
if i am to stay on here you must have a serious talk with him regarding respect and civility
charles could you help me with the dessert in the kitchen
in the kitchen
in the kitchen
kate and charlie leave
the camera remains on leopold sitting alone calmly sipping his wine
voice over from the kitchen i dont believe this guy
try to be nice to him
im always nice
please charlie as a favor to me
he gives me the creeps
he listens self consciously
hes different thats all
what was that crack about domestics
charlie this is important to me
youre not going out with him are you
i may be desperate but im not a lost cause
kate this is me
ive seen the guys you bring home
ive done countless favors for you
now im asking for just one little thing
overlapping oh all right
they emerge from the kitchen beaming
after a beat we forgot the dessert
i dont know if i mentioned it
but that is one fine looking suit
radio alarm clock a
louis armstrong begins to sing lets call the whole thing off
dressed in yoga clothes kate sits on her bed in the lotus position
she bangs the gong and closes her eyes
a bell rings
kate flinches but does not open her eyes
too sweetly what is it leopold
the bell rings louder interrupting kates routine
eyes closed screaming like a fishwife leopolds bell rings with determination
kate is off the bed and out of the room
kate enters and stops short
leopold sits at the table ringing a bell
the dishwasher is open and spraying wildly the blender has spread breakfast shake everywhere water is boiling over on the stove refrigerator freezer and every cupboard door is open
garbage disposal runs full blast
calmly amidst the chaos i cannot seem to find the tea
close up leopolds hand rings a bell with irritation
leopold kate and charlie stand in front of charlies open closet
leopold selects clothes from charlies wardrobe
good god no
he tosses them aside carelessly as charlie seethes
close up leopold rings his bell
kate and charlie form a line to the bathroom
kate checks her schedule and bangs on the door
leopold your time is up
whats he got a girl in there
leopold luxuriates in the bathtub wearing a whitecap marveling at the whirlpool and the instant hot water
he picks up a can of shaving cream and inspects it in wonder
close up leopold rings his bell
he discovers the clapper has been stolen
kate types talks and researches simultaneously
she looks up and stops suddenly
leopold appears wearing many oddly assorted layers of charlies clothes a bandanna bow tie irish woolen cap bicycle gloves aluminum baseball bat walking stick
he poses foppishly
i should like to read about modern currency during my bath tonight
see that the tub and basin are scrubbed up
remnants remain of this afternoons shave
kate nods at him stupefied
due to the many layers of clothing he imperiously leaves the room walking as if wearing skis
leopold rings a big new cowbell
no one responds
he discovers kate at her computer charlie reading a book
each are wearing a walkman
he stands in front of them and rings his cowbell furiously until they look up
leopold studies his questionnaire kate researches victorian customs
they simultaneously look up and gaze at the other
embarrassed kate dons her glasses and leopold shuffles papers
they look up again
then get back to work
kate sits on her bed with her laptop watching david letterman
she glances up laughs out loud
she looks at the dark empty room
no one is there to share it with
closing her computer she holds her pillow close to her
she slowly moves to the window and looks out
a text book with leopolds picture inside
leopold reads the brief summary of his life with heartbreaking astonishment
he moves to the window and looks out
kate and leopold gaze out of their windows
the camera slowly pulls back until they are swallowed up by the city
kate scans her notes as leopold paces dully about the room
in our last session you intimated there was a symmetrical system regulating the social order of conformity spanning your era
i found this particularly intriguing if i can just find it in my notes
a fire engine races by
leopold dashes to the window then turns back excited
the fire brigade
kate stares at him blankly
she munches rice cakes and drinks water from the bottle
she returns to her notes
this is insufferable
i refuse to be spied upon skipped over or shuffled about any longer
i have yet to venture outside this cell
before i go mad a more suitable arrangement must be found
startled a resolution
no i meant i found my notes
changes are in order
i can hear you
under control now miss coles as we are to remain here together there are certain conditions i insist are met and maintained
i no longer wish to be peeped at mocked
calmly or interrupted
jot this down
a horse should be made available from to
in new york city
also i feel very strongly about your style of dress
i do not care for it
kate looks up i cannot believe it is the prevailing taste for women to appear masculine and unkempt
if this is the fashion have it altered
that is all for the present
he grandly hands her a napkin
crumbs my dear
infuriated thank you
brushing herself off she heads to the door
i have been acquainted with many women in my time yet i am compelled to say that the modern woman is by far the least attractive i have ever encountered
rising to the occasion and i have a news flash of my own
you sir are no ronald coleman
she storms out
drake enters dr
kaus office with two pints of haagen dazs
chocolate peanut butter cookie dough swirl or peach
they dig in
lots of luck
no information exists detailing what happened to carlson
ive been working for weeks and im not any closer than when i began
how are you doing
my cholesterol level is up points
kate enters exhausted deposits an armful of papers on dr
kate has pencils tucked behind her ear through her hair and in her mouth
thank you kate
howre you managing with leopold
what did you hear
i was just asking
well its fine
hes a delight
everythings under control
keep up the good work
after shes gone she seemed a little scattered
do you think everythings all right
katherine coles is the most capable person we have on this project
if anyone can handle the delicacy of this situation kate can
so theres nothing to worry about
charlie shrugs charlie weve got to find him
working on a very stern portrait of kate at her computer are you crazy
this is the first time all week my eyes arent darting to the top of my sockets every five minutes
when did he leave
i dont know
an hour ago
he said he wanted to take a walk
and you let him
hes not allowed to go outside
is he being punished
weve got to find him
you stay here in case he finds his way back
and while you wait youd better pray hes all right
if anything happens to him anything at all everything weve worked for will have been destroyed
she heads out the door
kate calm down
and youll be responsible
she grabs her coat and purse whats the big deal
who is this guy
kate takes a long pause
is not really from canada
the sun sets
pigeons rest on window sills
suddenly the pigeons take flight
leopold leaves central park profoundly lost
looking both ways in the wrong direction he crosses the street
screeching brakes honking horns furious shouts with leopold horrified caught in the middle
he makes it across shaking and dazed
a motorist pulls along side of him
you stupid fucking son of a bitch
next time ill hit ya
leopold gapes appalled
a hansom carriage slowly treads into central park
leopold watches until it disappears
kate drives slowly searching for leopold
cars honk with mounting anger
whatre ya waiting for lady
she continues searching trying hard to remain calm
neon lights flashing
garbage in bundles
calvin klein ads
in the center of it all leopold jostled badly by the crowd tipping his hat to all the ladies
he enters a deli
leopold appalled by the prices searches for money
he has none
to the counter man
for a sandwich
is that correct
you gotta problem with that
it seems rather pricey to me
so dont buy one
he moves on
i would be happy to sample one however im afraid i havent the finance with me just now
if i could establish a credit with you i will have someone come round with the funds tomorrow
you will gladly pay me tuesday for a hamburger today is that it
a little confused i believe so
get the fuck outta here
i beg your pardon
fuckin wimpys piss me off
may i remind you merchant that i am the customer in this establishment and as such require your attention and the utmost respect
i do not accept this modern convention of desecrating ones patrons with such contemptuous disregard
you tell him
need i add that without our patronage you would not own that unwashed counter behind which you spew your filthy mouth
where do you get off
you dont even have any money
dont be irrelevant
not in my store youre not
he comes out from behind the counter
very superior do you intend to physically escort me out
leopold is thrown out of the store and on to the street
did you see what he did
did you see that
no one responds
leopold is left sprawled on the street
thunder is heard
gargoyles at new york city library the dakota the bowery alphabet city
leopold stands in front of the stables beaten and drenched
a car drives by screeches to a stop and hastily backs up along side leopold
leopold get in
leopold stares at the car
kate runs out opens the door and helps him in
she dashes back into the drivers seat
nearly in tears trying to dry him off leopold
oh leopold thank god youre all right
i didnt think id ever find you
you had us all so worried
she hits him hard
dont you ever go out again without my permission do you hear me
i was frantic
you could have been killed a hundred times over
i never would have known
she rests her head on the steering wheel exhausted
she pulls herself together and looks at him
leopold are you all right
looking deep into her eyes for the first time i wish to go home
ill get you home in a jiffy
badly shaken no
i wish to go home
kate gently observes leopold who stares rigidly straight ahead
on the phone i dont know
its just leopold
kate and leopold walk in wet and exhausted
never mind they just walked in
you look horrible
charlie dont start
i havent been this angry at you since you got me into that pyramid thing last year
if you make a wisecrack im going to burst into flame
it wasnt a wisecrack
you do look horrible
im too tired for this now
ill just save it up and kill you tomorrow
help leopold out of his things and lets get him to bed
ive something to say
to the both of you
nothing is what it seems
after witnessing mere weeks of this age it is painfully apparent i am outside of my acquaintance
i dont know how to proceed
am in need of assistance
im not very good at this
in the event you have missed it i am apologizing
there is a long pause
he shakes leopolds hand reluctantly welcome back
he leaves dont mind him
his heart would be in the right place if he had a heart
surliness runs in my family
it practically races through mine
shocked leopold you made a joke
i mean one thats not at my expense
they look at each other just a second too long
wed better get to bed
i start work
she looks at her watch in three and a half hours
they self consciously head to their respective rooms
im used to it
you mustnt get too used to it
youll find life passes you by awfully quickly
kate is struck by his vulnerability for the first time and is moved
she catches herself quickly however
thank you for
waving it away oh
they stand at their bedroom doors
well goodnight then
i dont have a clear handle on this
perhaps i was wrong keeping you confined to the apartment all this time
i dont know when youll be able return home
tomorrow ill start preparing you for the outside world
well find your way back
leopold smiles still shaken
they slowly close the doors to their respective rooms
leopold dressed for an outing knocks on kates bedroom door
kate stands in a slip calmly looking at leopold
leopold immediately turns facing the door
i beg your pardon
i i i was merely
is there something you want leopold
i merely wanted to see
that is inquire on your availability for an outing
my assimilation and so forth
yes we have a lot of work ahead of us
ill be out in a minute
yes of course
he reaches around behind his back and fumbles for the knob
he finally finds it and goes out
the brooklyn bridge the chrysler building rockefeller center th avenue
kate and leopold exit the gap
leopold awkwardly wears hip gap casual clothes a baseball cap on his head
are you certain this is correct
kate places the cap backwards on his head
she nods approvingly
certainly im certain
leopold watches himself in store windows
he cant comprehend it
kate leads him into barneys
leopold stands before the mirror wearing a classic dark suit
he looks fantastic
a fact that is not lost on kate
isnt this better
kate nods back begrudgingly her breath taken away
lincoln center columbus circle gristedes
kate selects a shopping cart begins to push it
kate walks ahead
leopold maneuvering a cart with a broken wheel hasnt the knack and bangs into everyone and everything in the aisle
close ups leopold scrutinizing vegetables in cans cereals for kids bottled water instant soup feminine hygiene supplies
the check out line
as their groceries are being rung up leopold spots the sun a newspaper with the headline woman sees satan in her microwave oven
leopold eagerly shows kate
have you seen todays paper
put it back
leopold reads the paper totally enthralled
kate and leopold walk down the street a bag in each arm
leopold eyes kate suspiciously
coles why is it you are not married
women are longer defined by the men theyre married to leopold
i have a career
i havent found a man who fits in with that yet
yet people still marry
defensively ive heard of cases
they continue to walk leopold noticeably studies kate
finally i suspect there is something wrong with you
theres nothing wrong with me
perhaps it is the way you present yourself
i dont know what youre talking about
there is some sort of problem when a woman reaches thirty and insists on remaining single
you think im thirty
do i look thirty to you
it was an arbitrary number
you chose it specifically opposed to a lower number
i didnt mean it
how old are you
sharply im thirty
but youre the first person whoever told me i looked it
leopold spots a formal dress in a store window
he takes a good long look at kate smiles then quickly walks inside
kate continues down the block
and its not that i insist on remaining single
everyone dreams of finding somebody to share their life with
to give someone all the love theyve been hoarding since they were a kid
im no different
but one has to be sensible
i have a career and a life thats filled with
she looks around
leopold is gone
she starts off down the street stops and enters robertas an upscale boutique
kate races in
leopold talks with a saleslady
what do i have to do
put a leash around your neck
to the saleslady she is the woman to whom i was referring
you see the problem
giving kate the once over yep
staring down at her clothes then back at the two of them what
from behind the dressing room door kate shouts to the others with irritation
this is ridiculous
i dont have time to
she shrieks do you know what this dress costs
lets get this over with
im coming out
kate leaves the dressing room in a huff completely unaware that she is stunning
leopold and the saleslady stare at her with pleasure
she turns and looks at herself in the mirror
leopold stands behind her pulls back her hair brushes away her bangs
you have a lovely face
even kate cannot deny that she is lovely
she stares at herself for a long while
quietly well take the dress
they become aware of their close proximity
they nervously part
kate sits leopold down on the sofa
she turns on the tv and hands him the remote control
what is this
the drug of the th century
she aims the remote at the tv changing channels
dinner is served
kate waits patiently for leopold who sits on the sofa watching the tv
leopold your dinners getting cold
he does not move a muscle
kate and leopold sit on the sofa eating their dinner and watching tv
on the screen a looney tune
leopold enjoys this especially
kate reaches for the remote but leopold grabs it territorially refusing to relinquish it
making notes its a guy thing
leopold asleep on the sofa still clutching the remote control
kate comes in with a blanket and settles it over leopold
she glances around the room then slowly bends down close to capture a better look at his face
after a moment she catches herself takes herself in hand and sits down at her computer
she opens her notes and types
her fingers slow down to a crawl and come to a stop
she looks up at leopold lost in thought
reaching for a soda she accidentally knocks a picture to the floor
in a smashed frame kate and carlson drunkenly mug for the camera
kate pales noticeably
she looks from the picture to leopold
slowly she begins pecking away at the keys
she does not look up again
kate gives leopold a tour of the lab stopping by dr
hidden behind chalk boards calculator paper and several empty haagen dazs containers dr
drake searches for solutions
now within that astronomical structure dr
drake here is searching for a pathway between your time and the present
hell find it too if his arteries dont harden first
once that is discovered the search begins for the exact time and date travel will be possible
they move to dr
kau how are you proceeding
kau merely grunts
leopold looks at kate
dont take it personally
kau starts working you just have to wait until her batteries run down
were all pretty much like that
they head into kates office
kate gathers her belongings leopold snoops at her notes
the complexity of this equation is astonishing
can you really comprehend all that
almost apologetically im a genius
youre quite exceptional dr
a beat that is to say you all are
and may i say that sometimes in dim light youre not so bad yourself
they stand together leopold grinning sheepishly
oh my god
is that the time
every tuesday night
may i accompany you
i am not certain i understand therapy
no one does
thats why therapists can charge so much
as she gathers her belongings leopold spots a very high heeled red shoe in kates bag
what exactly transpires during therapy
a gentleman does not ask those questions
come on well get you home
i am perfectly able to travel homeward myself
kate looks at him skeptically
i have finance and our address
i shall take a cabbie
you are late
i am not a child
dont bite my head off
she shakes her head and walks out the door
kate heads down the stairs of a subway station
a few feet behind leopold cautiously follows
kate waits in line at the turnstile
leopold a ways back grimaces noticeably at the smell
kate heads through
leopold follows banging painfully into the bar
a nun hurriedly bumps into him from behind
he tries pushing the bar but it doesnt budge
he turns around to step out of line but it is already too long
he stands nose to nose with the nun
i cant seem to
impatiently oh for heavens sake
the nun deposits her token and squeezes them both through as the train arrives at a deafening pitch startling leopold
he spots kate entering the train and jumps into the car in the nick of time
the train departs leopold pressed awkwardly against the glass
kate races from the subway station entering the arthur murray dance studio
leopold thoroughly disheveled follows at a distance
elderly blue haired couples chat amongst themselves men on the right women on the left
kate in dance clothes out of breath stumbles in making a b line for the womens side
i was worried
i thought you werent going to make it
smiling happily miss my lesson
this is the only thing i have to look forward to all week
is that a new dress mrs
pincus executes a fancy spin proudly showing off her purchase
across the room mr
pincus beams in anticipation
an elderly overly made up dance instructor enters
she claps her hands together loudly
all right kids
the men slick back their hair
the women straighten their gowns
kate stands to the side self consciously studying the floor
the men take their places on the dance floor
they flick their hand twice inviting their women to dance
cooly elegantly the women approach their partners
after a while kate looks up relieved
she stands alone
ballroom music plays
the couples effortlessly shift between steps and turns
kate dances with an imaginary partner stumbling more than a beat behind counting animated a concentrated yearning look spread across her face
the instructor approaches with a look of resignation
dont think so much katie
feel the music
sweating i am
dancing should not be work
it should be a vacation the body takes from the mind
let the music wash over you
frustrated it is
repeat after me ive got the muusic in me
ive got the muusic in me
overlapping ive got the muusic in me
keep telling yourself that
her instructor shakes her head and moves away
across the room through the window leopold watches moved
over the music beyond the swirling couples kate remains in the corner dancing with her imaginary partner fighting valiantly for the right steps muttering to herself dancing alone
kau slams a large book on dr
plodders desk startling him
ive located her
is she all right
shes really not
photograph of a sweatshop
the conditions are appalling
positioned among the workers julia carlson thin ragged worn out stares helplessly into the camera
it was taken a year after she arrived
look at her face
we have to get her back
christine this morning i spoke with the head of funding
theyre talking about canceling the project
they cant do that
theres still time
nothing has happened yet that cant be undone
well get her back
well put this behind us and well get her back
the doctors stare at the photograph
charlie and leopold work at their easels
leopold sighs is there something on your mind
there is a pause
this is rather difficult for me
i have been in the salon contemplating the reception i have received by the various tradesmen i have visited
ive determined i am lacking the dexterity of modern intercourse
i realize our association has been rather distant and i bear you no ill will
you can imagine my relief
the fact is
i need help
why not ask kate
i would appreciate the masculine point of view
why not ask kate
that was a joke
leopold looks worried
charlie puts down his brush
i guess we could start by removing that great big stick from up your
lets start with your walk
you dont walk right
gently you strut
very defensive strut strut strut
you walk into the bathroom its like im watching a parade
walk across the room
i will not
i know you wont
you asked for my help
trust me on this
as leopold struts across the room charlie shakes his head and spontaneously begins to hum sousas stars and stripes march
leopold becomes more and more agitated
as the song crescendos thats enough
charlie hops up casually walks around the room and begins to hum a more relaxed version of stars and stripes
between choruses see
leopold begins humming the more casual version of the song and mimics charlie
now try to enjoy your walk
its a beautiful day
the sun is shining the peasants are singing
voice over charlie and leopold joyously singing the stars and stripes
as the song builds charlie enters leading leopold throughout the room
leopold matches charlie exactly step by step so tightly they appear to be one person marching happily about
chinatown little italy chess in washington square park
leopold and charlie explore the city
leopold works diligently on his walk
a beautiful woman walks by in a revealing outfit
charlie catches leopold watching her and smiles broadly
leopold caught leering turns away sheepishly and smiles
charlie pats leopold on the back
pats his back again
what the hell is that
leopold are you wearing a corset
cracking up charlie good naturedly puts an arm around leopolds shoulder
leopold attempts the same pulls away
with a headset on charlie listens to music
whatd ya say was the name of this number
waltz of the flowers
charlie stops the music and places a headset over leopolds ears
leopold watches calmly
charlie selects a song
instantly leopolds shoulders rise up to his ears
his mouth opens wide
high speed dirt
after a bit charlie turns the music off
leopolds shoulders go down but his mouth stays wide open
charlie and leopold walk through the park
a rubber softball hits leopold squarely on the head
what in the world
a couple race over
the man is black
the woman is white
their child elizabeth follows wide eyed and apprehensive
were so sorry
are you hurt
shes another babe ruth
we had no idea
are you okay
leopold regards them curiously
what do you have to say for yourself elizabeth
leopold stares hard at the modern familial scene
he doesnt speak
after a long moment is this your child
charlie braces for the worst
the little girl stares at leopold
cmon honey lets go
i want my ball
just a moment
bending down to elizabeth firmly pick a hand
she picks his right hand
she picks his left
leopold looks surprised then pulls the ball from his ear
she takes the ball and smiles at him
my mothers name was elizabeth
then to her parents shes a beautiful child
youre very lucky
what do you say elizabeth
elizabeth makes an embarrassed face
charlie and leopold continue through the park leopold lost in thought
charlie watches him in surprise
they walk on
leopold talks animatedly
on the table pumpkin pies pizza pies and pot pies
i understand pumpkin pies pizza pies and pot pies
but i wish someone would explain eskimo pies
he eats a large spoonful of pudding
kate and charlie exchange a worried look
you smoke camels you wear old spices and you drink mountains dew
to kate the pudding tonight is excellent
another thing ive noticed everyone is in a great rush today
instant oatmeal instant coffee speed stick minute maid
youll find theres much to be said for moderation and languor
he eats another spoonful
is it tapioca
taking the spoon out of his mouth its marvelous
well im off
work to do
where are you going
im meeting everyone over at caffeine
its this coffee house we go to
say hello to dennis for me
who is that
dennis is this really good looking friend of mine who doesnt know kates alive because she doesnt know how to flirt
as a rule i dont like to associate with really good looking people
it makes me feel really
i dont know
but dennis is a nice guy
and he always picks up the check
i shall join you
thats a wonderful idea
leopold mentioned how he wanted to meet
people of quality was it
if youd rather i didnt go
charlie you dont want to hurt leopolds feelings
hes going to think you dont want him to go
oh its not that
its just that its sort of a vulgar crowd is all
im not sure youd have such a good time
a little ribald humor
im not as big a stick in the mud as you might think
id enjoy a gay night out kicking up my heels
there is an awkward pause
leopold is so enthusiastic and sincere that despite a feeling of disaster charlie relents
finish off your parquet and well go
charlie gives kate a look of death as we charlie and leopold approach caffeine a trendy coffee house
charlie looks in the window
there they all are
now one more thing
throw the words like and you know into a sentence whenever possible
its how people talk today
proper speech does not cease to exist simply because it is ignored
charles you neednt fret
i have the walk down pat
i will not give myself away
looking in the window oh shit
correcting himself shoot
what is it
see that girl
the blonde one
shes so inconceivably hot
patrice a tall blonde sits at a large round table talking
she is very beautiful
shes very pretty
ok not exactly mine
but i saw her first
i guess we should go in
i dont suppose we could tell everyone you dont speak english
of course not
lets go inside
leopold walks his casual walk inside followed by a very reluctant charlie
charlies friends are sitting at a table talking
they are a relaxed and friendly group
charlie and leopold approach
ad lib greetings charlie
whereve you been
uh everyone this is my friend leo
how are ya
how are ya
after a beat leos staying with us for a while
charlie pulls out a chair for leopold but leopold sits next to patrice instead
patrice takes out her cigarettes
leopold takes a cigarette lights one for patrice then his own
thank you my dear
at a loss um
all look at charlie i have nothing to say
you did not tell the truth about patrice charles
what did i tell you leo
he informed me you were inconceivably hot but i think youre lovely
thank you leo
to the waitress check please
the subway car is inhabited solely by leopold charlie and the oldest ukrainian woman in new york city
despite the fact that the train is empty they are all seated on the same bench
charlie stares straight ahead refusing to even look at leopold
the ukrainian woman hangs on every word
just drop it leopold
but charles it is so ridiculous
i am not interested in her
in any case the problem is not with me but with you
quietly you have no idea what it takes to go about courting a woman
from what ive witnessed tonight it is symptomatic of your entire generation
almost speechless you are some piece of work leopold
now i do not wish to get personal
charlie bursts into ironic laughter and looks at the old woman
she rolls her eyes
but you have been of great assistance to me and i feel this is one area where i can be of some real help
now why was i successful with this young lady and why did you so miserably fail
what makes you think she likes you
well she gave me the number of her telephone and i assumed it meant
as i see it the girl hasnt an inkling of your intentions
and its no wonder
you charles are a merry andrew
a merry andrew
i am not
everything plays like a farce to you
the more wit the less courage
i believe the modern woman desires passion protection sensitivity
no woman wants to be romanced by a buffoon
the old woman shakes her head banter and repartee are fine but you must add to that a different sort of playfulness
you think i should pounce
im saying you must treat her with respect
any oaf can attempt a crude pass
a woman of kates stature would never respond to an artificial tactic
you said kate
i did not
yes you did
didnt he say kate
the old woman nods
we are discussing your problem
you like my sister
she has trouble with men you know
perhaps she has not met the right one
she has met the right one
hundreds of times
but she pulls back
she cuts herself off
you turn around and suddenly youre dating a sphinx
one never can tell
does kate know how you feel
have you made your intentions known to her
whos the merry andrew now
i think youre all talk and no action
what are you waiting for
i do not know if there is a future in it
well leopold no one ever does
kate enters with an arm load of leopolds discarded clothes
she drops them on his bed and begins to hang them in his closet
a notebook falls from his pants pocket
she puts it on the bureau
she quickly picks it up sits on the edge of the bed and starts to read
reading out loud royal family uncouth
making out slow soulful kissing
woman as equals
she flips a page
who drove the chevy to the levy and why was it dry
she flips the page
eyes shine when she talks about
raises her voice when she knows shes wrong
bossy bossy bossy
lose my train of thought when i see her smile
most beautiful when shes angry
the front door is heard slamming
kate alarmed stuffs the notebook back in leopolds pocket
she races to the door glances back at the notebook turns off the light and scurries from the room
the corridor is darkly lit
kate leaves the bathroom as leopold enters
they collide and separate but remain close together
both are dressed in pajamas and speak softly
bread and butter
bread and butter
its an old saying
well not to you i guess
you say it when you pass someone in a cramped space
as close as bread and butter
did you have a good time last night
it was very interesting
did you find that person of quality
leopold looks at her a moment
there is a pause i guess its time to turn in
she reaches her door
leopold stops her
leopold grasps for the words but the habit of inaction returns
he slowly closes the door charlie stands at patrices door with a large painting
he looks over at leopold hiding the next doorway over
she opens the door
i brought you some flowers
he hands her the flower filled painting
i was wondering if you would do me the great honor of accompanying me to the cinema tonight
and allowing me the privilege of escorting you to dinner afterwards
patrice shyly studies the painting
charlie quickly looks at leopold pleadingly
he really does not want to say this next part
leopold however is adamant
deadpan gracing me with your conversation and company would mean the world to me
there is a long pause
patrice watches charlie in disbelief
ill call for you then
they smile at each other for a long moment
silently mouthing goodbye
she closes the door it worked
of course it did
i have no idea what to do next
leave everything to me
not so fast buddy
kate is by the bookshelf gathering reference books on time and space
he is suddenly embarrassed and doesnt know how to proceed
youre up early
she moves to her computer on the other side of the room
before she can sit down leopold pulls out her chair
she falls to the ground
he rushes to her side immediately
im terribly sorry
happens all the time
she opens a reference book and slowly begins typing at her computer
there is a pause
i was wondering
she stops working and looks at leopold
what it is youre working on
its my computer
she resumes her work
actually i meant the work itself
im researching the correlations between your time and the present
leopold stares blankly
im trying to get you home leopold
charlie peaks in signaling leopold spurring him on
i have never seen a woman work as diligently and extensively before
its made me the man i am today
its quite a beautiful day have you noticed
perhaps you would permit yourself some time off and grant me the privilege of escorting you around the city this fine spring afternoon
oh id love to but i cant
ive got too much work to do
ask charlie though
hell go with you
im afraid it really wouldnt be the same
it is your company i am seeking
surprised kate turns around and looks at leopold
gently oh leopold
im so sorry
some other time then
leopold sits at the far end of the room
kate takes a moment then resumes typing
she stops and sits back in her chair
after a long moment she subtly unplugs the computer with her foot and starts banging on the top of it
oh for crying out loud
would you look at this
the computers on the blink again
she bangs harder cheap piece of equipment
maybe if you
no no it does this all the time
just have to wait it out
perhaps it is a sign
oh you think
she smiles at leopold leopold trots his horse expertly along the horse path
kate follows clutching the horses neck bouncing like a clown
i must have gotten a funny horse
leopold turns and rides around kate
boats on central park lake
couples in sheeps meadow
holding the reins of kates horse in one hand leopold grasps kates waist with the other as they ride a single horse through the greenery of central park
a revival house
on the marquee the tenuous duke starring ronald coleman
kate and leopold eat popcorn milk duds m ms and large drinks
the lights go down and the movie begins
the enormity of the medium strikes leopold at once
he involuntarily leans back in his chair grabbing kates shoulder watching attentively
after a bit is that supposed to be my hair
do you see how they think my hair looks
kate looks over at leopold and nods
through his eyes she too experiences movies for the first time
she moves close to him
grammercy park the guggenheim museum central park plaza the metropolitan museum
kate and leopold bound up the steps entering the museum
modern art exhibit
leopold stares blankly at an empty white canvas
he turns to kate questioningly
thats simplicity in its purest form
it speaks volumes in its nothingness
whiteness representing emptiness
leopold eyes the painting skeptically
they move to the next object dart
aaand this represents
they burst into giddy laughter
they round the corner moving to the next room
leopolds smile fades
close up a painting of privileged victorian society
shaken he gazes at a painting in a dream like state
very quietly id almost forgotten how beautiful it was
kate smiles sadly at leopold
they slowly walk out
we hear keys in the lock and laughter outside as kate and leopold enter
laughing m ms cbs fbi
they collapse on the couch
ah jfk pdq xyz
i dont know
i dont know how you keep up with it
so am i
ill tell you what
why dont i prepare dinner tomorrow night
i never have before
i mean even before i hit town
hit town hows that
i cant imagine what itll taste like but i dont think it will be any worse than your cooking
leopold i have a date tomorrow night
a blind date
oh im so sorry
no that just means i havent met him before
it was set up through friends
a hazard of single life
im turning in
kate gets up
leopold automatically stands
another time then
its quite all right
as she gets to the door she stops
i had a wonderful time today
i cant remember the last time i took the day off and just played
id forgotten how beautiful this city can be
i want to thank you for that
the pleasure was mine
kate smiles at leopold and goes out
charlie in a tie is standing with leopold at the dining room table
kate wearing too much makeup for her date runs into the bathroom in a bright red dress
its a very fancy restaurant leopold
are you sure you can teach me everything there is to know
from the bathroom just dont swipe the silverware and give yourself away
nobodys talking to you
it is very simple
i will be your date
just behave as you normally would and ill correct you along the way
now escort me in
charlie and leopold move across the room
after a beat charlie magnanimously gestures for leopold to go first
leopold gives his approval
kate rushes out of the bathroom in a tight black dress
leopold and charlie elegantly walk to the table
charlie sits down pleased
leopold remains standing incensed
leopold takes a cloth napkin hits charlie upside the head
pull the chair for a lady
no name calling
to kate well really
charlie stands up and pulls out the chair
as leopold sits charlie pushes the chair in to hard
youre not shoveling coal into a furnace charles
glide the chair in gently
try it again
charlie gently glides leopold to the table
he remains standing not sure what to do next
well sit down
now dont burst a vein or anything but there are quite a few knives and forks here
how do i know what each ones for
merely start from the outside and work your way in
what kind of beer should i order
how do i look
leopold and charlie stand
kate poses in the gown picked out by leopold
leopold smiles brightly
you look exquisite katherine
almost sadly thank you leopold
she looks at leopold not knowing what to say
finally this is a tie im wearing
you look very nice charlie
the doorbell rings
that must be him
your bland date
remember to breathe kate
and dont use to many big words
youll scare the poor slob away
moving to the door this is always the scary part
she sings open the door to my mystery date
she opens the door and looks straight up
leopold and charlie peer in closer to get a better look
in the doorway stands larry great looking very tall a winner
kate turns back to the others with a frozen smile
well im off
giving larry the once over kate may i have a word with you
as they cross the room i dont like the look of him
what are you talking about
i can spot one a mile away
he helps her with her coat i shall escort you out myself
i will act as your chaperone
that isnt necessary
ill be fine
it is no trouble
she is gone
leopold stares after her dejected
kate and larry are led to their table
larry sits down
kate remains standing
friendly sit down
sighs thank you
she sits so
how am i doing
i beg your pardon
how am i doing
he snaps his fingers to get the waiters attention startling kate
she laughs nervously
what did jeannie say about me
ah she said you were tall
and nice looking
and that you persevere ardently on wall street
well i work there
after a beat that must be very interesting
laughing youve obviously never worked on wall street
laughing along for the hell of it no
their laughter subsides
after a beat what else did jeannie say about me
the maitre d of this very fancy restaurant shows charlie and patrice to their seats
charlie motions patrice to go first just as leopold has instructed
the maitre de pulls out patrices chair
charlie gives him a look to back off
charlie effortlessly glides patrice to the table and takes his seat
have i told you how much i liked your painting
if you get tired of hearing about it let me know
i have to admit i was sort of surprised when you called
i didnt think you liked me charlie
when i first saw you i thought
he makes his jaw drop down to the floor what do you think now
charlie smiles and places her hand over his heart
then he makes his jaw drop again
patrice laughs happily
kate and larry are eating their dinner
aaand thats about all jeannie said
what did jeannie say about me
smiling she said you were enormously sexy had a great body but you dont put out
quite a compelling portrait
turning on the charm would you say its an accurate portrait
leaning into larry a masterpiece
leopold slowly carries a dinner tray to the dinning room table
he moves to the window and looks out
after a while he pours a glass of wine
as they eat their dinner larry drones on
so this guy wants to invest in a stock thats no good
heres what i do
kate stares absentmindedly at larry her mind somewhere else
she looks down at the fork in her hand
she switches to the proper one reflecting on leopolds etiquette
she notices her napkin lying flat on the table
she reaches for it
leopold unfolds his napkin and puts it on his lap
he begins to eat his dinner
kate places the napkin on her lap
she stares at it a long while
finally she looks up at larry
im telling you the guy was a dick
a total asshole
jarred awake who
the guy ive been talking about
realizing her feelings for leopold smiling radiantly at larry goodbye
then as she leaves a parting shot
dont get up
sound of keys in the lock then kate bursts through the door
the living room is dark and empty
she goes through the living room past the hallway into the bedroom
his bedroom is empty
he is not there
she runs into charlies studio and stops short
next to charlies stern paintings leopolds portrait of kate shines in the moonlight
she wears an antique dress
she is lovely
kate sees herself as leopold sees her and is touched
she turns and collides head on with leopold
bread and butter
he is wearing gloves and an apron
he rubs his bruised head inadvertently leaving a trail of suds along his face
youre back early
did you enjoy your date
she moves in close trying to remove the soap from his face
here youve got some
he wipes his face making it much worse
is it gone
she uses the apron to wipe away the soap
they gaze at each other and become serious
softly a funny thing happened to me on my bland date this evening leopold
i really cant explain it
this puffed up puritanical blundering greenhorn kept popping into my mind all night long at the most inopportune times
i couldnt get rid of him
yeah it was
the harder i tried the more persistent he became
hes conceited and inflated and unseasoned and it doesnt seem to matter
hes years old but i cant get him out of my head
is he there right now
larger than life
ill protect you
a long romantic passionate kiss
coles would you grant me license to dine with you tomorrow evening at eight oclock
until tomorrow then
leopold gestures for kate to go first
they head down the hallway together into their separate rooms
the table clock chimes eight times
leopold enters from the kitchen dressed perfectly in the most up to date style
he carries a casserole dish
a second later kate enters from the hallway
she is wearing an old fashioned antique dress
she looks lovely
a little startled you look beautiful
what have you got there
leopold opens the casserole dish
i know you like it
she looks behind him into the kitchen
a colossal mess
leopold lights the candles and pulls out her chair
this time shes prepared
he slides her chair to the table
the candles have burned down casting a romantic glow throughout the apartment
louis armstrongs what a wonderful world plays
kate and leopold sit on the couch sipping wine
tell me more
um where was i
so after my father died i had to go to work
have you had many jobs
i got fired from all of them
im the most unskilled person i know
but they were just survival jobs while i was still in school
i always knew i wanted to go into science like my father
and i did
do you miss him
i think about him every day
he was courtly just like you
i think you are a remarkable woman katherine coles
you just dont get out much
youd be surprised how remarkable im not
no it is you who would be surprised
anxiously they stare into each others eyes
they kiss again
slowly kate leads him to her bedroom door
they look at each other deciding
deliberately cautiously kate opens the door
kate puts her fingers over leopolds lips
gently she leads him inside
they slowly embrace as the door closes
sunlight floods the room
clothes are scattered about
two figures lie curled up together sleeping in bed
one of the figures rolls around
the covers are pulled back revealing good morning
leopold wearing a bathrobe is pouring coffee
the table is set for a huge breakfast
kate also in a robe enters from the hallway
there is a moment of awkwardness as they see each other for the first time
they kiss shyly
kate notices the feast
look what youve done
my own mother never made me a breakfast like this
i will have to have a talk with her
about last night
please sit down
he pulls out a chair for her and kneels beside her
kate i had never before been a considerate man
i had with astonishing complacency squandered my life waiting for some incentive to force me into action
you have made me see how rare our time here really is
i am most beholden to you kate
and always will be
i sense the word but entering into this any minute now
leopold takes her hands in his
she looks at him defensively bracing for worst
do me the honor katherine of becoming my wife
kate lets out a very girlish high pitched scream shall i take that as a yes
did you just ask me to marry you
i love you kate
thats entirely beside the point
youre moving way too fast here
shouldnt we date first
i mean its obvious the first one went well
where i come from thats pretty much the way it works
leopold even though last night we
loved each other that doesnt mean this morning were engaged
it just doesnt work that way now
taking a ring off his fingers and placing it on hers i have loved you since i first set eyes on you
i cannot imagine my life without you beside me
i want to marry you kate and make an honest woman of you
oh leopold sit down
they switch places
leopold sits and kate kneels beside him
relationships these days are much more complicated than that
women today have certain freedoms that men have been taking advantage of for centuries
you must have been aware of that
if you think about it clearly it should be obvious to you that marriage between us is out of the question
do you not love me kate
almost inaudible dont ever think that
then consider my proposal
ill think it over but i can tell you now the answer is
he kisses her
out of breath possibly
a knowing smile i need you beside me
i will not give up easily
smiling do what you have to do
kate and leopold become extremely selfconscious
too casual and too chipper morning
charlie is immediately aware that something is not quite right
he studies the two of them and nonchalant sits at the table
kate and leopold serve themselves breakfast
to kate coffee
as leopold pours they look at each other shyly
after a pause i would like some coffee
she pours charlies coffee until it overflows
as kate wipes up the table charlie notices her ring
he eyes leopold suspiciously
leopold concentrates on his plate
charlie gives kate a questioning glance
she smiles at him looking both innocent and guilty at the same time
after a beat uh huh
all smile privately and sip their coffee without another word
buried behind open books and crumpled up paper kate labors in earnest
she stops suddenly almost violently and studies the notes in front of her
the coffee cup falls from her hand and breaks
calling from her office kate are you all right
she covers her papers and self consciously cleans up her mess
she sits down slowly and peeks at her notes
she has solved the puzzle that will send leopold back
she looks up in disbelief and glances through her window around the lab
everyone is hard at work
helplessly she stares back at the paper on her desk
she pulls open her drawer and takes out the picture of carlson
she stares at it for a long time
she opens her mouth to call for the others stops and looks at the photo
slowly with great indecision kate crumples up the paper
she returns the picture to the drawer
after a long moment she opens a book feigning research her mind a million miles away
leopold and kate sit on her bed watching david lettering
kate clutches her pillow close to her
she looks over at leopold concentrating on the tv with furrowed brow
she smiles sadly
she takes her pillow and flings it off her bed
she snuggles up to leopold
they watch tv
central park in full bloom botanical gardens the frock museum
leopold and kate eat lunch
leopold scans a newspaper
on the tv over the bar bob dole is speaking out against gun control
public office is apparently still the last refuge for the incompetent
show me a man who does not want his gun registered and ill show you a man who should not own a gun
what is a pee pee girl
what are you reading
the village voice
after much consideration i have decided it is time i join the work force
as a pee pee girl
perhaps not that but i am determined to acquire honest employment
leopold i dont know if thats such a good idea
kate my life back home was beneficial to no one
i want my new life to have value
i wont make the same mistakes twice
you have to be patient
i could conceivably wait my whole life away
youre awfully cute when you get causey
i will not waste any more time
i must make a difference
customers fill the aisles
in the center of it all leopold is hard at work
he holds a bottle of perfume
try our fragrance
would you like to try our new fragrance today
what is it
it is called poison
he squirts some at her
i dont think so
have you got i beg your pardon
elizabeth taylors passion
next aisle over
leopold looks after her
after a beat give your mother in law what she really deserves this season
give her some poison
the doctors enter kates office and closes the door
the doctors remain silent whats the matter
there is a long pause
slowly kate realizes the doctors are on to her
she puts down her pen
so you know
we had to go through your computer to access information
your calculations have been verified and the final course has been set
leopold goes back a week from friday a
how long were you going to keep it a secret kate
were you even going to tell us at all
im not sure
what can you be thinking
you cant alter the course of history and assume everything will be okay
it wont be
he has his own destiny to fulfill in his own time
quietly you dont understand
gently hes going back kate
the doctors slowly leave the room and close the door
just the sound of the clock ticking
kate sits at her desk very still
no no no
charlie knocks and enters
there you are
ive only been hollering for the last
he sees her face
kates eyes are red and swollen
she lays out leopolds belongings
what is it
very detached its time
leopolds going back
ill get his things together
tell him tonight
he goes to her
are you all right
pulling away im fine
you dont look so fine
well i am
it was wonderful having him here charlie
he was of invaluable assistance to the project
she shrugs ill miss him
youll miss him
goddamnit kate you love the guy
kate remains silent
kate dont do this
its not right
what am i supposed to do charlie
i cant go back
he cant stay
i cant let him go
im not equipped to deal with this charlie
i dont know how
listen to me kate
dont be the ice princess
beginning to tear up im not
you cant live your whole life under a microscope
youve got to tell him how you feel
breaking down in his arms its too much charlie
its just too much
you owe it to him
i didnt know i could feel like this
i really didnt know
so i looked him right in the eye and said ego is natures compensation for mediocrity
i turned and i walked
he never said a word
he probably didnt understand it
are you all right
youre awfully quiet
how was your day
taking a long pause its time
leopold looks at her
were sending you back
slowly pushing his plate away when
a week from friday early morning
it was a mistake leopold
its out of our hands
we cant pocket people from history like stolen jewels
we havent the right
well miss you
is that all
what do you want me to do fall apart
youd still be leaving
it wouldnt solve anything
who is this woman sitting across from me
what do you want me to say leopold
tell me that you love me as i love you
let me hear you say it
kate remains silent
leopold abruptly throws money on the table
i will not do this
we starts out
leopold walks out of the restaurant trying to remain calm
his emotions get the best of him
finally exhausted he winds up walking along central park south
hansom carriages wait to be taken out
he approaches slowly
he stops along side one of the cabs and strokes the horses head
he looks at the horse for a long time
then he looks at the skyscrapers surrounding him deciding what to do
he lays his face against the horses head torn
kate sits at the dinning room table behind empty sara lee boxes pints of ice cream beer bottles and is working her way through the cookie dough
leopold enters through the front door disheveled
look at you
you look awful
you should see what im looking at
i went back to the restaurant
they told me you went out looking for me right after i left
that was pound cakes ago
where were you
i had a lot to think over
just where i stand around here
there is a long pause
quietly we should have come up with something together
i might have been spared ten or seventy pounds
is that an apology
im sorry for what i said
leopold goes to her
he gently prys cookie dough from her hands
im not going anywhere
yes you are
im not going
im staying here with you
we have no right to
it is my destiny
it is my decision
have you thought about what youd be sacrificing
your family your whole way of life everything
youre not just feeling sorry for me because i ate the contents of the refrigerator are you
i love you kate
the single most miraculous event in my life was not how i arrived here but that when i did i found you
overwhelmed here comes the mushy part
after much consideration ive come to the conclusion i no longer desire a large estate with a full staff and ornate grounds
thats good because if youre staying ill probably get fired again
what do you desire
a beautiful wife a small home in the middle of nowhere lots of children and fine schools with pms meetings every other sunday
i love you too
i do leopold
i love you too
leopold and kate sit calm and resolute
the doctors are in an uproar
this is outrageous
i wont allow it
the decision is not yours to make
do you realize what youre saying
youre tampering with fate preordinance and god himself
we do that every day doctor
it is called choice
carlson is still over there
you cant simply abandon her
we have to get her back
do you think im not aware of that
do you think a minute goes by that i dont feel responsible for her
but only one person can return
the capsule accommodates only one person
leopold has to find her
perhaps she does not wish to return
perhaps shes found greater happiness in her new life
it happened to me
maybe this is her destiny
maybe shes of more important use back there
julia carlson died in the center factory fire of two years after she arrived
she was years old
there is a stunned silence
she was a friend kate
she was never expected to sacrifice her life for this experiment
i wont be a party to it
i know what im asking
theres no way we can force you to go
just think it over
a clock is ticking loudly
kate and leopold lie back to back
youre going back arent you
i keep seeing that poor womans face
she was terrified
you said you wouldnt leave me
ive never been lucky
not one time
six months ago i wouldnt have given it another thought
i wouldnt have lost a moments sleep
youve changed me kate
there is no turning back
i wouldnt want you to change
thats whats tearing me up inside
either way i lose
youve changed me too
i cant go back to my old life anymore
i cant live like that again
god my heart is pounding like a drum
ive never been so scared in my life
take me with you leopold
take me with you
you dont realize what youre saying
you dont understand the kind of life youd lead
what youd be giving up
id be with you
i cant ask that of you
just ask me
come back with me
she slowly turns
she embraces him
dressed to the nines leopold leads a blindfolded kate through the street
she is clumsier than usual
where are you taking me
this is something ive wanted to do for a long time
she takes off her blindfold and looks up at the sign leopold
this will be very therapeutic
he takes her arm and escorts her in
leopold leads kate to the dance floor
he opens his arms and kate steps in the way she was taught in class
leopold pulls her close
this time there is no pretending
partnered together they shine
they move beautifully effortlessly
its almost more than they can bear
as the music plays they stop
leopold holds kate tightly
they look at each other for the longest time
large screen computers are working overtime
kate leopold and charlie accompany the doctors to the capsule
it is nearly time
the time tables have been set
just strap yourself in and youll be fine
you have only a twenty four hour leeway before the machine is set to return to us
you must find carlson within that time frame and get her on board or there will be little chance of her finding a way back
its been a real pleasure
you have a much nicer smile than ronald coleman
the privilege was mine
goodbye leopold and thank you
she gives him a kiss oh my
well send kate to you
as soon as possible
ill see to it myself
see that you do
you have my word on it
the doctors leave
four minutes and counting
ill make this quick
he sticks out his hand
impulsively leopold embraces charlie i shall miss you charles more than you know
ill miss you too leopold
youre the only one who knows how to program the vcr
take care of my sister
take care of yourself too while youre at it
i dont have any words for this
i will see you soon
youll be with me all the time
i brought you something
she takes out a ring and slips it on his finger
so you wouldnt forget me
so you wouldnt think this was all a dream
dont forget about me
i love you kate
wait for me
for as long as it takes
i will come back to you
ill be waiting
they kiss again for the last time
its time leopold
leopold holds kates face in his hands
very slowly they part
leopold takes his place in the machine and straps himself in
he places one hand on the red lever and the other against the glass pane on the door
kate comes over and places her hand over his
wordlessly they say goodbye
after a moment dr
kau gently moves kate away
plodder silently raises his arm signaling leopold
leopold shifts in his seat his eyes never leaving kates his hand still against the glass
kate smiles tenderly at leopold
plodder drops his arm signaling leopold
leopold pulls the lever still gazing at kate
there is a blinding flash of light then darkness
kate raises her head
she sits at her desk surrounded by the doctors
i cannot in good conscience let you go
its out of the question
i cant be a part of it either kate
its too big a risk
kate rises and moves to the window
she is a full nine months we cannot guarantee your childs safety
its that simple
hes waiting for me
i can feel it
she gazes out the window searching the horizon
down from the horizon a farm house
leo coles years old rocks on his front porch swing
using his bare hands as puppets he carries on a conversation
julia carlson pulls up in her car
does katherine coles live here
yelling inside youre leo arent you
you dont remember me but i knew you when you were yea big
she holds her hands an inch apart yeah
im an old friend of your mothers
proudly we had spaghetti at our house times this week
kate comes out on the porch
she looks lovely
leo you dont have to holler like that
im not deaf
the two women scream run to each other and embrace
carlson i dont believe it
i dont know how many years
what are you doing here
i came to see you sweetie
you remember my son leo
weve just been getting acquainted
well come inside
kate heads straight for the kitchen
carlson scans the living room before joining her
although rustic on the outside the inside of the house is furnished with antiques and is victorian in style
covering her agitation would you like some tea
i wish you had called before you come over
it would have given me a chance to straighten up the house
tell me what youve been up to
catch me up on everyone
i heard you received some big endowment or something
i was going to write then call but
she picks up the cup and saucer but it shakes so violently she has to put it down
its all right kate
there is a long pause
carlson gets the tea ready
finally youd leave in days
thats not a lot of time to get your affairs in order
and i warn you its nearly impossible for an intelligent woman back there
kate stands by the back door looking out at leo
hes a fine boy kate
leopold would be proud
were aware of your situation but we felt when the time came you deserved the option
kate nods trembling slightly
kate stands in the doorway as carlson drives off
who was that lady
just an old friend
what she want
she looks at leo nothing important
you brush your teeth
leo shows off his teeth
then give your old mom a hug and go to bed
leo gives her a hug and a kiss good night cookie
kate wraps herself in an old blanket and moves through the house turning off the lights
it is very guiet
all we hear are kates footsteps and the sound of the clock ticking
she makes her way upstairs enters her bed room
she sits down by the window at her desk
she sits a long time lost in thought
she slowly pulls open a drawer and from deep inside pulls out an old photo album
she opens it and begins to look through
inside old black and white photographs newspaper clippings magazine articles trace leopold throughout his life
a photograph of leopold looking as he did the night he departed this world
he stands stiffly beside his family for a formal portrait
very discreetly he points to a ring
it is the same ring kate gave him
a newspaper article shows leopold donating to establish a scientific center researching studies in time and space
a magazine picture shows leopold the sole male figure marching to give women the vote
a photograph of a large formal wedding
leopold around fifty stands alone in the wedding party surreptitiously pointing to his ring
a magazine article shows leopold in his sixties establishing a scholarship program for studies in physics
he is surrounded by academia and subtly points to his ring
a photograph of leopold around seventy shaking hands with albert einstein and smiling broadly for the cameras
a professional photograph of leopold at seventy five sitting regally in a chair
beside him an empty chair
he rests one hand on the back of the chair
the other he holds against his chest showing off the ring
an obituary with the headline philanthropist dies in bombings
a tear falls on the page
kate cries silently looking out the window
the camera follows her gaze past her property
leo and his bride take to the floor for the first time as husband and wife and are greeted with applause
kate older beautiful hair cut short looks on in wonder
charlie standing with patrice and their blonde children approaches kate and leads her to the dance floor
hes so young charlie
hes old enough
look at that idiotic expression on his face
of course hes happy
all weddings are happy
its the living together afterwards that causes all the trouble
julia carlson under dressed over anxious enters the banquet hall
she stands at the back of the large room searching
couples fill the dance floor
across the expansive room over the tops of heads charlie and kate bob amongst the guests
leo cuts in
as they spin in the briefest of seconds kate spots carlson
kate peers over leos shoulder
her eyes lock with julias
julia nods with purpose
kate holds onto leo tightly not wanting to let go
she buries her head in his chest
oh youre so young
i love you leo
always remember that
from behind her shoulders shake as she cries
mom were only moving to denver
i know cookie
from behind a glass partition carlson works at her console
a monitor counts away the seconds
in the darkened lab kate dressed in early s attire straps herself in and smiles tearfully
their voices echo in the lab
they embrace each other for the last time
what will i do without you charlie
softly live happily ever after
pushing the intercom button kate its time
its a letter for my father
tell him about me and
um tell him i love him
i want him to know me
mom i want you to go
he puts his finger to her lips
he looks to his wife then back at kate
he nods his head
they force themselves to smile trying to get through the moment
charlie leo and his new bride stand back
inside the craft the only light comes from the glowing red lever
carlson raises her arm signaling kate
then to her staff
kate presses her hand against the glass as a final goodbye
she grabs the lever with her other hand and turns away staring straight ahead
charlie puts his arm around leo
there is a bright white flash
kate is gone
the others stand there motionless stunned
the screen is black
a flash of light illuminates the forest at the albany estate
kate races from the forest onto a massive lawn stumbling in mud as she hurries to the mansions entrance
huge double doors open to reveal an ornate ballroom
the creme de la creme have gathered and dance
kate overwhelmed rushes down an elaborate staircase
half way down she looses a shoe
she hesitates briefly then continues to the dance floor
in the center of the floor leopold looking very distinguished and attractive dances with a flirtatious young woman
try as she might leopold keeps her at a distance
brushing his shirt front i just love a starched white shirt
its so elegant
you dance like an angel miss beall
you light up the room around you
i thank you
with a big smile thank you
the music changes a lively charleston
leopold heaves a sigh of relief and makes his way through the crowd up the staircase
the dancers become an intricate maze a dead end at every turn as kate searches each male face
in the foreground leopold is stopped by a woman midway up the stairs
as they chat leopold reaches down and picks up the muddy slipper offering it to her
she turns in a huff flouncing down the stairs
simultaneously in the background kate desperately looks for leopold
leopold studies the slipper as he makes his way up the stairs
he slows down hesitates and stops
very slowly he turns around
he becomes very still
tears well up in his eyes
the ballroom clock strikes midnight
kate climbs an opposite staircase to get a better view then stops
in her heart she knows
slowly she turns
leopold stands quietly at the bottom of the stairs gazing up at her
he extends his arm showing her the ring
he offers her his hand
the crowd the room the world around them disappear
their eyes lock
as she descends the staircase the years melt away
kates short hair grows long cascading around her shoulders
the fine lines around leopolds face are gone
they see themselves through each others eyes at the moment of youth when they fell in love
leopold bends down places the slipper on kates foot
he rises looks down at his hands and then up at kate
his hands are caked with mud
she smiles helplessly
not caring he wraps his arms tightly around her
music begins to play a slow waltz
he nods to her
she takes a deep breath
her head bobs in rhythm
she begins to count silently
leopold smiles counting along
an elderly couple watch leopold with interest
who is that dancing with leopold
ive never seen her before
kate and leopold dance past
they are older
as they gaze into each others eyes they twirl
the look of youth returns
at the center of the floor they stop dancing
the rest of the world dances around them
over this background
the scrapbook pictures bleed onto the old formal wedding photo becomes a photograph of kate and leopold the perfect bride and groom both discreetly point to their rings
kate stands with leopold as he establishes a scholarship for studies in physics
the old photograph of leopold and albert einstein changes to include kate waving and smiling broadly for the camera
the professional photograph becomes a double portrait
it shows the two in their s sitting regally in matching chairs
they hold hands and smile serenely
staring directly into the camera they show off their rings
slowly the scrapbook closes
kate and leopold dance the music swells as they become lost in the crowd
the clock chimes
