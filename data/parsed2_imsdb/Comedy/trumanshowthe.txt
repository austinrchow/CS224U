the truman show early by andrew m
niccol a screen play by andrew m
niccol a white title appears on a black screen
one doesnt discover new lands without consenting to lose sight of the shore for a very long time
andre gide the title fades off replaced by a second title
were all in this alone
lily tomlin a fiber optic camera observes a five month old male fetus as he gently floats weightless suspended in the amniotic fluid of his mothers womb
we focus on the unborns hand already a tiny exquisite work of art moving towards his newly formed lips
he sucks his thumb
a seconds old baby boy umbilical cord still attached smeared with blood and protective skin grease is held up by an anonymous pair of latex gloves to the camera
shocked by the unaccustomed light and cool of the delivery room the newborn fights for his first arduous breath
following almost immediately a cry
from another angle we see the crying infant on a television screen the individual lines of the screen clearly visible
the face of the baby thirty four years later still crying
truman burbank thinning hair a body going soft around the edges appearing older than his thirty four years sits at the wheel of his eight year old oldsmobile cutlass supreme
he cries without shame making no attempt to wipe away the tears
pausing at an intersection in a quiet working class suburban street a spherical glass object suddenly falls from the sky and lands with a deafening crash on the roadway several
yards in front of his idling car
truman exits the oldsmobile to investigate
amidst a sea of shattered glass are the remains of a light mechanism
he looks around him but the street is deserted
he checks that all the surrounding streetlights are accounted for even though the fallen fixture is far larger
he looks up into the sky but there is no plane in sight
with some effort truman picks up whats left of the crumpled light loads it into the trunk of his car and drives away
truman sits behind the wheel of his car unscrews the cap of a miniature bottle of jack daniels and empties the contents into his styrofoam cup of coffee
stirring it in with his finger he burns himself
as truman drinks he becomes aware of the delighted squeals of children coming from the gymnasium of utopia elementary school adjacent to the parking lot
the sound of the children triggers a memory in his head
unlike a conventional flashback the scene in his memory appears to be playing on a television screen
a sandy haired seven year old truman runs towards a bluff on the beach
the boys father kirk late thirties beer bottle in hand flirts with two teenage girls at the shoreline
suddenly the father remembers his son
he looks anxiously around
the sight of the boy at the far end of the beach causes him to drop his bottle in the sand and run to him
the boy is near the top of the cliff before his agitated father comes within earshot
out of breath clutching his side truman
truman turns from his perch and waves happily down to his father
but the smile quickly vanishes when he registers the anger and distress on his fathers face
come down now
his fathers unnatural anxiety makes the next bay even more tantalizing
the boy considers defying his father
he puts his hand on the rock above him to stretch up and sneak a peek at the other side
one good stretch would do it
reading trumans mind enraged no
sensing his father is keeping something from him why
unconvincing nothings there
its the same as this
trace of desperation come down please
truman is suddenly aware that the hundreds of other beachgoers have stopped their activities to stare at him
reluctantly he starts to retrace his steps down the rocks
when he finally jumps to the sand his father grabs him roughly by the arm and drags him away down the beach
i told you to stay close
dont ever leave my sight again
you gotta know your limitations
you couldve been washed away by the tide
truman emerges from a subway exit in lower manhattan and walks briskly down the bustling street
a snarl of taxis buses and commuter traffic
a street vendor thrusts a pretzel under trumans nose a career woman catches his eye
truman stops at a newspaper stand and plucks an issue of cosmopolitan from the rack quickly flicking through the glossy pages
glancing in the direction of the newspaper vendor and finding him busy with another customer truman deftly tears a portion of the open page and pockets the cutting
he guiltily replaces the magazine startled to find the newspaper vendor standing close behind him
quickly recovering gimme a copy of the sydney morning herald
we ran out
hastily departing thanks anyway
as truman hurries away the vendor picks up the copy of cosmo and instantly turns to the torn page
it is a lancome advertisement with isabella rossellinis nose missing
truman is still in view but the vendor makes no effort to confront him almost as if he were expecting it
passing one of the tall black mirrored buildings that grow out of the pavement truman glimpses himself in the reflective glass
he doesnt like what he sees and attempts to suck in his gut but quickly concedes defeat
the image triggers another childhood memory
once again the flashback appears to be playing on a television screen
the sandy haired seven year old truman sits in the middle row of a catholic elementary school classroom surrounded by thirty or so other well scrubbed uniformed youngsters
douglas the boy next to truman is on his feet under the scrutiny of a sixty year old nun with a face as wrinkled as her habit is starched
i wanna be a chiropractor like my dad
impressed tell the class what a chiropractor does douglas
he helps people by fixing their backs sister olivia
thats right douglas
holding her back hamming it up perhaps ill be your first patient
the class titters
douglas sits down pleased with himself throwing a smirk to truman
what about you truman
truman rises to his feet
i want to be an explorer with reverence like magellan
the sisters face falls
no ones going to pay you to do that truman
with scarcely disguised glee besides youre too late
theres nothing left to explore
the class roars with laughter and truman takes his seat
from trumans pov we see that he is staring up at relief letters that proclaim american life accident insurance inc
above an office buildings entrance
a police officer walking his beat wanders in trumans direction
from another angle we observe truman from the police officers pov shaky handheld camera on a television screen
truman enters the building
in a cramped cluttered windowless cubicle truman talks on the telephone
into receiver okay okay lets call it what it is
im not gonna lie to you
life insurance is death insurance
you just gotta ask yourself two questions
one in the event of your death will anyone experience financial loss
and two do you care
a clerk drops a large reference book on trumans desk
he checks the spine mortality statistics to present
into receiver hold on will ya
to clerk putting receiver to chest referring to the book thiss no good
lumps all drownings together
i need drownings broken down by category
the clerk shrugs returns the book to his trolley and continues his rounds
returning to his call just think about what ive been saying and lemme
the person on the other end has hung up
with an apathetic shrug truman replaces the receiver
he looks over his shoulder and places another call
lowering his voice can you connect me with directory inquiries in sydney australia
a long delay makes truman even more uncomfortable er yes
do you have a listing for a lauren powers
pause nothing listed
what about a sylvia powers
truman replaces the receiver disappointed
truman stands in line with a crush of other white collar workers
as he reaches the counter the store owner tyrone has anticipated his order and ahs already begun preparing a meatball and mozzarella sandwich on italian roll
truman gazes at the sandwich skillfully under construction pained by his own predictability
nauseatngly cheerful hows it goin truman
deadpan not bad
i just won the state lottery
not listening to trumans reply as truman anticipated good
tyrone what if i said i didnt want meatball today
not missing a beat id ask for identification
truman forces a half smile
we focus on another male office worker in line at the cash register watching truman out of the corner of his eye
about to depart with his sandwich the man receives a guarded rebuke from the female cashier
a whisper to prevent truman overhearing hes right there
youre supposed to pay when hes here
nonchalant shrug as he departs he never notices
we re focus our attention on truman who is taking the wrapped sandwich from tyrone
hold on truman
i got somethin to show ya
tyrone holds up a front page of the new york post that features a photograph of a scaled down replica of columbus santa maria moored in front of the manhattan
trumans eyes widen at the photograph
referring to the photo the flagship of christoforo
our genoese navigator huh
i know you love this like me
averting his eyes with difficulty not me
you got the wrong man
tyrone tries not to let his disappointment show as truman pays the cashier and exits
see ya tomorrow truman
truman eats lunch alone on a concrete bench in a cement park
from his briefcase he pulls out an old hardcovered book to the ends of the earth the age of exploration
a transient in a wheelchair approaches looking for a handout
truman gives the homeless man half of his sandwich reconsiders and gives him it all his appetite gone
as the transient wheels himself away truman loses himself in his book
close up on an old mans face
hair pure white late sixties a vitality in his eyes that belies his years
he stands beside a floor to ceiling window in a dimly lit room
outside the window a single palm tree swaying against a deep blue californian sky
a news anchor style earpiece disappears down the neck of the unconventionally cut suit he wears
suspended from the ceiling above his head is a television monitor upon which a surveillance picture of truman engrossed in his book silently plays
chloe twenty something androgenous looking similarly suited joins christof at the window
never taking his eyes from the monitor you ever pass a car wreck on the side of the road
theyre pulling out a body
you know you shouldnt look but you do
a group of a dozen men and women of varying ages sit around a circular conference table in a sterile windowless meeting room
all stare at a single telephone placed in the center of the table anticipating a call
on cue the phone rings and one of the men after waiting for the second ring picks up
im sorry i got more than enough insurance
he hangs up
after a moment the phone rings again
truman sits at his desk making a cold call
into receiver this isnt about insurance this is about the great variable when will death occur
could be a week a month a year
could happen today
a sunbather minding his own business gets stabbed in the heart by the tip of a runaway beach umbrella
no way you can guard against that kinda thing no way at all
the prospect on the other end unimpressed with his pitch hangs up
trumans supervisor lawrence younger than truman by several years sharper suit sharper haircut appears around the corner of the cubicle
handing truman some documentation hey burbank i got a bridge buyer in stapleton i need you to cloes by four
truman turns pale
stapleton on staten island
sarcastic you know another one
i cant do it
insistent a half hour across the bay
do you good
searching for a plausible excuse i got an appointment uptown
this is a sure thing
conspiratorial theyre upping our quota
you need this
lawrence exits the cubicle
trumans head drops
he picks up the framed picture of his wife from his desk
meryl early thirties a petite woman easy to mistake for frail
he deposits the photo in his briefcase and departs
truman briefcase in hand ashen faced stands in line for the staten island ferry
as the tourists and commuters impatiently brush past him onto the boat truman remains frozen to the spot mesmerized by the scummy water rising and falling beneath the dock triggering
a flashback in his head
the flashback once again appearing an a television screen the seven year old truman sits alongside his father kirk in a small sailing dinghy
shouting above the wind lets go further daddy
lets go further
shouting back its getting late truman
entreating his father please
kirk shakes his head ruefully and indulges his son by heading towards the gathering storm clouds on the horizon
truman turns and begins to fight his way back against the tide of passengers boarding the ferry emerging back on the street into the bright sunlight gasping for air
gathering himself he makes for the entrance of whitehall street subway station
two commuters surrepticiously observe truman as he departs
commenting out of trumans earshot i cant believe hes taking the long way
hell never make it
truman stands in a packed subway car anxiously glancing at his watch wiping his perspiring hairline with a hankerchief
a taxi crosses the verrazano narrows bridge towards staten island
truman keeps his eyes shut tight all the way across
refusing to look down at the entrance to new york harbor
truman finally reaches his destination at a well to do condominium on bay street
as he approaches the lobby he realizes he has perspiration showing through the armpits of his suit jacket
a middle aged concierge behind a reception desk is having his hair brushed by a younger man in his mid thirties
anticipating trumans arrival the hairdresser fusses one more time and swiftly departs through a rear door
truman enters the lobby and approaches the concierge trying to keep his arms tightly at his sides to hide the perspiration
im here to see a mr hamilton
you from the insurance company
you missed him
when will he be back
he waited as long as he could
you was supposed to be here by four
a clock on the wall reads
truman sits by himself in the rattling subway car defeated
the only other occupants in the train a tall woman mid thirties reading a pulp novel and two male youths late teens sitting opposite the woman slouching ogling her
to woman you wanna read to me
his companion smirks
more insistent you wannna read to me
the woman looks up unaware of the boys presence until now
she quickly avoids eye contact and returns to the book
the other boy reaches over and snatches the novel from her grasp
menacing my friend asked you a question
the woman picks up her bag from the floor in a reflex and holds it to her
she looks around the train for assistance briefly catching trumans eye
the youths also look in trumans direction staring him down daring him to interfere
truman quickly averts his gaze
reaching for the book please
the boy returns the book to the woman but before doing so rips out the last page from the novel and stuffs it in his shirt pocket
now youre gonna have to ask me how it ends
the train pulls into a deserted station
feeling vulnerable the woman jumps up from her seat and exits
the youths sensing a chase also exit
scanning the empty platform the woman realizes she has made a serious error
truman watches through the trains open door as the boys corner the frightened woman but still he remains in his seat
were gonna tell you how it ends baby
one of the youths produces a knife from his pocket and waves it in the womans face
dont you wanna know how it ends
the boys pin the woman to the station wall with the weight of their bodies
the woman looks again in trumans direction
again she makes eye contact eyes pleading
the womans second scream is muffled as the train door closes
truman looks up to the emergency handle beside the door
there is still time to act
he stands up and half reaches for the handle but moves no further
the train abruptly pulls away leaving truman time to see one of the youths covering the womans mouth while the other reaches under her skirt before the train enters the
truman bows his head in shame as the train rattles on
the train safely out of sight the youths promptly release the woman
she calmly hitches down her skirt no longer afraid
the young men no longer angry help fix her hair and retrieve her shoulder bag
the threesome walk along the platform together as if lifelong friends
pondering the incident he did nothing
shrugs suddenly more couth physical violence paralyzes him
the backyard of a modest but tidy one story tract home
beyond the plank fence at the end of the property flows a busy expressway
truman wheels a lawnmower towards the garage as his wife meryl pulls up the drive in her four year old toyota camry
she has a sensible blue vinyl bag over her shoulder and carries a new knife set in a wooden block
she kisses truman affectionately on the cheek
proudly referring to the knife set i got it free with the tune up
looking over trumans shoulder she notices a small uncut patch of grass missed by truman in one of his passes
you missed a section
meryl enters the house
truman restarts the lawnmower and obediantly pushes it towards the offending patch of lawn
as the mower brushes up against the unconforming blades of grass truman pulls back abruptly
he checks the kitchen window for meryl and wheels the mower away leaving the patch uncut
meryl is applying ointment to her wrists as truman enters
referring to her hands do they hurt
i was afraid id seize up during cross
one of the keys kept sticking
truman picks up meryls newspaper and skims idly through it
he notes an article headlined slaying trial enters sixth week
referring to the article is he gonna take the stand
dispassionate matter of fact no point
two eye witnesses saw him near the dumpster where they found the legs
she flexes her arthritic wrists
you gonna eat before you leave
ill get something out
sensing something odd in his demeanor did something happen today
truman turns to her too sharply his guilt showing
composing himself what could happen
an abandoned freeway project in queens
the four hundred yard stretch of deserted freeway is paved but unmarked
at one end is an off ramp that abruptly ends in inid air reinforcing steel protuding from the concrete
truman stands at the end of the off ramp with marlon thirty two the kind of physique some descibe as fat others big
marlon drinks beer from a can while truman addresses a teed up golf ball with a number three wood
truman winds up and swings making a healthy contact with the ball
the ball arches away into the night sky lit by the adjacent operating roadway
from a new angle we see the ball take a huge hop on the outside lane of the abandoned freeway and continue down the asphalt
marlon tosses truman another ball from a bucket of badly scarred golf balls a ball initialed with the letter t
truman sets the ball up on the makeshift tee area and launches himself into his second shot
with a slight fade the second ball carries even further than the first
truman hands marlon their sole golf club without comment
marlon is still looking admiringly in the direction of the shot
whose nuts were those
opening a beer from the six pack mine
marlon tees up a ball of his own
initialed with the letter m
i gotta get out marlon
mild interest only yeah
outta my job outta queens
marlon takes a practise swing
outta your job
what the hells wrong with your job
you gotta great job
you gotta desk job
id kill for a desk job
marlon addresses the ball and swings
a sweeping hook shot that bounces off the freeway out of bounds
annoyed by the errant tee shot sonofabitch
it doesnt mean anything
still looking in the direction of his ball nothing means anything
try stocking vending machines for a living
my biggest decision of the day is whether the almond joys look better next to the snickers or the baby ruths
truman selects another m ball from the bucket and tosses it to marlon
adamant i gotta get out
overcompensating with his second shot marlon slices the ball in the other direction
a lucky bounce keeps it on the cement fairway
skeptical picking up his beer sure and go where
truman gulps his beer as he prepares his answer
unable to disguise his reverence australia
impressed no shit
where is australia exactly
truman picks up a golf ball to demonstrate
he points to a dimple on his make shift globe
see here this is queens
sliding his finger around the other side of the ball all the way round here australia
you cant get any further away before you start coming back
tossing the world in his hand warming to his subject yknow therere still places in australia where no human being has ever set foot
still dubious so when are you leaving
its not that simple
takes money planning
you cant just up and go
heading off marlons skepticism oh im gonna do it dont worry about that
i just gotta move slow
pick a moment
bonus times just around the corner
soon as i get a retaining wall built on the back of the house i can start thinking about selling up
and ill be gone
up and away on that big steel bird
as if to convince himself im going dont you worry about that
marlon nods even though the concept of taking flight is beyond his imagination
i never knew anybody who got out
an awkward moment
truman once again not so sure of himself
he masks his doubt by teeing up another ball
truman and marlon wander down the empty freeway retrieving the golf balls
as they return them to the bucket they check the initial on each ball to determine the winner of their long drive competition
slightly the worse for drink tick fucking tock
thats the fucking problem marlon
im thirty four
im older than jesus christ
marlon looks sideways at truman
it sounds to him like the beer talking
where do the dreams go marlon
picking up the last ball marked with an initial t trying to ignore the question you win
where do the dreams go
humoring his maudlin friend theyre still there
just buried under what we settled for
they approach trumans oldsmobile
truman opens the trunk to deposit their humble golfing equipment
inside are the remains of the fallen light fixture
referring to the light you really think it couldve dropped off an airliner
you oughta report it
quickly changing the subject you coming for a drink
i cant tonight
the lines of a television screen signal another of trumans flashbacks
a small group of mourners in black several openly weeping stand on the end of a small jetty including the seven year old truman dry eyed in an ill fitting
suit his weeping mother older sister raquel and a priest at the head of the gathering
the priest nods to truman who holds an ornate wreath heavy and cumbersome in his tiny hands
he heaves it off the dock
a smaller more simple wreath lands on the calm dark water beyond the jetty twenty seven years later
truman stares at the wreath for a long moment turns and wanders back towards the shoreline
in his work suit minus his shoes and socks he sits on the sand
he has a portable tape recorder slung over his shoulder and points a corded microphone at the surf
for a long while we watch trumans impassive face as he makes the recording of the lapping waves staring up at the handful of stars visible through the gloom
we focus on the lantern room of a nearby lighthouse
from the lights pov through the green hue of a night vision camera we observe truman get to his feet and walk towards the dark water
shouting at the surf im sorry
christofs dispassionate face is reflected in the screen of a television monitor that displays the distraught truman at the waters edge
at the formica kitchen table truman makes calculations in a school notebook a bottle of beer close at hand
meryl appears in her robe a glimpse of black negligee beneath restless
she throws her arms around trumans neck
suggestive what are you doing
come to bed
ignoring the suggestion i figure we could scrape together eight thousand
suddenly exasperated oh
god everytime you and marlon we could bum around the world for a year on that
and then what truman
wed be back to where we were five years ago
youre talking like a teenager
maybe i feel like a teenager
getting to his feet
truman holds meryl by the arms talking excitedly to her the way we imagine he did when they were courting
meryl itd be an adventure
we said wed try for a baby
isnt that enough of an adventure
that can wait
i want to get away
see some of the world
meryl gives a derisive laugh
you want to be an explorer
you mean like all the other great explorers from queens
you dont even have a passport truman
i bet you dont even know how to get one
the words sting
truman turns away
seeing the pain shes caused she changes tack
everybody thinks like this now and then
making one more attempt at seduction come to bed
in a nightwatchmans office two uniformed guards drink coffee
how can they have a child
its not gonna be his you idiot
you think shed go through with it
reassessing his own opinion guess i always thought theyd adopt
truman stands in the darkened bedroom in his hanes underwear looking down at his bed
meryl has fallen asleep waiting for him snoring lightly
truman rests his hand tentatively on the bed
the surface rocks
the motion triggers a flashback in his head
as always the flashback appears to play on a television screen
the seven year old truman sits on the upturned hull of a small dinghy in calm deep water
plaintively calling into the mist daddy
his cries go unanswered
two old women seventies sit beside wach other on a sofa against a bare wall looking directly into camera as they talk
nothing else of the room is seen
playing amateur psychiatrist it left him with more than his obvious fear of the water
its as if he felt his father had gone beyond his limitations and he vowed never to repeat the mistake
he was never the same curious little boy again
were all born with a pound of cocaine up our nose
by the time were eleven it runs out
half the people i knew named their babies after him
truman emerges from the subway station and as usual stops at the newspaper stand
he picks up a copy of vogue and flips through the glossy cosmetic ads surreptitiously tearing claudia schiffers nose from one of the pages
he returns the magazine to the rack and begins his daily pilgrimage to work through the rush hour pedestrian traffic
pausing to check his profile in the mirrored building he glimpses the reflection of a homeless man standing directly behind him
truman spellbound by the man suddenly wheels around to face him
the homeless han is in his late sixties
more well groomed and well fed than the average vagrant with a serene smile on his face
from a new angle we see a two shot of truman and the man on a television screen
the homeless man places his hand ever so gently on trumans cheek
truman makes no effort to withdraw
he is transfixed by the the mans eyes
he appears to recognize him
almost to himself mouthing the word daddy
suddenly a distinguished old woman walking a small dog and a young male business executive carrying a briefcase walking in opposite directions along the sidewalk grab the homeless man one
taking each arm
a bus suddenly screeches to a halt beside the struggling group doors already open and before truman can react the old woman and the young executive force the homeless man
onto the bus
truman lurches after them but he is met by the bus doors closing sharply in his face
to bus driver hey stop
truman thumps against the doors but the bus driver ignores his cries and the bus roars away from the curb
he starts to run after the bus colliding with several pedestrians who make no attempt to avoid him
stepping blindly into the street he tries to hail a taxi
a vacant cab suddenly switches off its for hire light as he reaches it
truman pleads with the taxi driver through the closed windows and locked doors of the cab but the driver is apparently oblivious to trumans shouts
frantic truman dashes into a nearby parking structure and grabs a bunch of car keys from the key rack of the unsupervised parking attendants kiosk
running along the rows of parked cars truman desperately presses the car security buttons attached to the key rings a car alarm chirps and truman turns in time to see
the cars winking sidelights
he jumps inside a brand new bmw and guns the car
the parking attendant alerted by the squealing tires appears from the mens room and attempts to wave truman down
running after the car hey
truman ignores the attendant and accelerates into the street without looking causing a taxi and a postal van to take evasive action
catching sight of the bus in the distance truman leans on the cars horn as he recklessly weaves past other motorists
he is only a couple of car lengths from the bus
reading aloud the id number of the bus two four oh six
suddenly the taxis and cars directly in front of him start to slow for no apparent reason
truman looks for a way around but the cars crab across the street blocking any passage working together almost as if they are running interference
shouting at the cars outta the way
outta the way
the bus is escaping
truman suddenly jumps the sidewalk in the car scattering the same cars on the street that seemed intent on slowing his progress suddenly accelerate in unison anticipating his move
by the time truman reaches the end of the sidewalk the cars are clustered together on the corner in an impenetrable jam
truman spies the bus turn the corner at the far end of the street and disappear from view
fumbling with the gear stick
he finally finds reverse but turns to find a hostile group of pedestrians herded tightly together behind the car leaving truman with nowhere left to go
the car door is suddenly jerked open and the out of breath parking attendant yanks truman from the drivers seat
what the fuck are you trying to pull
cowering the fight instantly gone out of him im sorry
no harm done
no harm done
feverishly inspecting the fenders for dents he finds none i oughta fuck you up
the attendant looks into trumans terrified eyes
they get the better of him
get the fuck outta here
the attendant shoves trumans briefcase into his arms and brushes him aside
as he departs truman notices that the traffic jam in the street and the mysterious crowd of pedestrians has dissolved
row after row of parked buses
truman and marlon exit an administration office
instead of heading for the exit truman begins marching down the first row of buses inspecting the number painted on the rear of each one
whatre you doing
gesturing to the office the man told you theres no such bus
two four oh six was definitely the number
marlon stops walking
truman continues his inspection
seeing there is no reasoning with him marlon hurries to catch him up
i never believed he was dead
trying to be patient cmon truman a lotta times they dont find a body
you know what the currents are like in that water
shudders a memory flashing in his head you had to see his face when that wave hit
he wasnt scared marion
it was like he was expecting it waiting for it
he knew it was coming
why would he fake it
trying to make light hes not elvis presley
ignoring the joke pondering the mornings events you know what was really strange about today
an old woman with a little dog and a businessman walking in opposite directions on the sidewalk both react like clockwork
they force him onto a bus against his will a bus that doesnt normally stop outside my building
and when im giving chase the bus never makes another stop and i get the feeling that the traffic and the pedestrians are working together to make sure i never
catch up with it
sarcastic oh so now its also the pedestrians and the buses and the cars
what are you saying the entire population of lower manhattan is conspiring to stop you finding out that your father staged his death to pursue a life as a street
oh yeah that makes sense
truman has no answer
we see an aerial shot of truman and marlon on a television screen continuing to check the rows of buses marlon still marveling at trumans obstinance
they have come to the last bus in the final row
truman hangs his head
the offending bus is not amongst them
he makes towards the exit without comment and marlon follows
unseen by the pair we focus on the id number on one of the buses they have previously checked
a single drip of black paint trickles off the last freshly painted digit
truman and marlon drinking beer sit in the rear doorway of marions delivery van wholesale sized boxes of candy stacked behind them
you think i imagined it dont you
i think youre missing your dad
trying to be delicate the anniversary was yesterday wasnt it
truman is surprised marlon remembered
marlon nods to the sidewalk
you got sand in your cuffs
truman looks down at his feet
a small tell tale pile of sand has poured out of his tight trouser cuff
maybe youre right
if only the old woman hadnt left her dog behind
we see a flashback in trumans head of the earlier scene in the lower manhattan street
it confirms that the old womans dog was abandoned on the sidewalk
truman stands in the corridor of his mothers cramped fussy
doilyed apartment with his older sister raquel late forties prematurely grey
through a doorway the figure of his mother is visible asleep in bed despite the early hour
truman and raquel speak in hushed tones to avoid waking her
dont you dare go in
i just got her off to sleep
it was dad
raquel fixes truman with a contemptuous stare
well the next time he shows up
bring him over
until then im not saying a word about this to mom and neither are you
if it wasnt him it was his twin
can you think of a reason hed want to hide from us
i know a reason hed want to hide from you
look at how you treat us
you live ten minutes away we hardly see you from year to year and then you turn up with this story so insane you dont even believe it yourself
havent you hurt her enough truman
she already blames you
incredulous i was seven years old
but youre here and hes not
has it really taken you this long to invent a story to ease your conscience
im telling you hes alive
snapping back bitterly and im telling you hes fish food
truman meets her unforgiving eyes
without another word he walks out of the apartment
truman safely departed the figure in the bed rolls out
christof fully clothed relishing the danger of being so close to truman without being detected
raquels demeanor immediately changes all trace of bitterness gone from her face she appears younger posture more upright almost a different person
christof hugs raquel
you did well
a cavernous dressing room contains a long row of identical mirrored make up tables
at the only occupied table trumans contrite father kirk is having whats left of his homeless disguise cleaned from his face by a make up artist under the watchful eye
of two dark suited bodyguards
from a mezzanine floor out of kirks vision christof and chloe also take in the proceedings
behind their heads a monitor shows a surveillance picture of an agitated truman sitting in his car trapped in rush hour traffic
weve tightened security
christof nods indifferently knowing the damage is already done
referring to kirk why would he do this to us
you play someones father all those years you are someones father
he sees the way truman is
he feels responsible
christof turns and enters an office adjacent to the balcony containing a state of the art monitor and vcr
christof plays the cued recording without comment
we focus on the screen
a younger looking christof sits in a motorboat in the calm water of long island sound
trumans father kirk twenty seven years younger and a dark haired boy trumans age at the time acting as a stand in sit in the stern of a sailing dinghy
two scuba divers in the ocean
barking instructions to kirk as soon as we give the cue tack to windward
kirk rehearses turning the tiller in the instructed direction
the freak wave will strike from the starboard side
remember you dont go to the diver
the diver goes to you
to simulate the wave one of the divers puts his full weight on the side of the dinghy to capsize it
kirk and the boy are tossed into the water
while the boy immediately bobs to the surface in his life jacket kirk fails to surface
after a long moment he reappears with the second diver some distance away
now wearing a spare aqualung
of course on the day you only surface once youre safely beyond the cove
try it one more time
kirk is staring at trumans stand in clinging to the upturned boat
kirks expression suggests he is not a totally willing participant in the masquerade
the present day christof freezes the monitor on kirks uncertain face
a cluttered garage dimly lit by a single work lamp
truman looks over his shoulder before turning his attention to a dusty trunk under a canvas sheet
the trunk is fastened with a combination lock
he deftly dials the correct combination and opens the lid
inside mementoes from his youth
a how to sail book a stack of great exflorers magazines and beneath it all a garment in a drycleaning bag
truman carefully lifts up the plastic to reveal a schoolgirls lavender cardigan decorated with pearl beading
he puts the cardigan to his nose and breathes deeply
truman hastily drops the cardigan in the trunk and shuts the lid
meryl standing close behind
whatre you doing out here
turning attention to an upturned mower on the garage floor fixing the mower
meryl doesnt look like she buys it
concerned your sister called
she was worried about you
matter of fact i saw my father on state street dressed as a homeless man
attempting to comfort i kept seeing my brother for years after he died
irritated at her subtle dismissiveness what do you want
i made macaroni
i gotta go out
about a replacement
hastily adding mower blade
meryl nods not at all convinced
after an uncomfortable pause she turns and heads back to the house
truman ruefully examines the broken car aerial on his freshly washed oldsmobile
in the background is the warning sign he has just ignored close windows lower aerials
truman removes the metal coathanger from beneath the lavender cardigan and forces the bent wire into whats left of the severed aerial
truman motors down a busy shopping street crowded on both sides with pedestrians
as he drives he tests his car radio
adjusting the tuner knob he finds a station
female voice from radio west on atlantic
hes making a right on woodhaven
truman glances up at the street signs along his route and finds that they coincide exactly with the streets quoted on the radio
distracted he almost bowls over an old lady on a crosswalk
male voice from radio god truman almost hit marilyn
hes on the move again passing the burger king
truman readjusts the radio as it starts to fade out
suddenly there is a piercing blast of feedback
he looks up and as far as the eye can see every pedestrian motorist and shopkeeper along the street suddenly winces in pain and holds their right ear at exactly
the same moment
from radio in distress himself somethings wrong
truman tries to pick up the channel once again but without success
still shaken by his experience with the radio truman exits a drug store with a small brown paper bag
out of the corner of his eye he catches a male bystander still checking his right ear with his finger
he goes to say something to the by stander but thinks better of it
hookers in white heels and spray on skirts display their wares
truman cruises slowly past in his oldsmobile the expression of the prostitutes turning from seductive to contemptuous as each is by passed
suddenly truman pulls sharply into the curb beside a leggy prostitute veronica wearing a platinum blonde wig
she is in deep discussion with a fellow working girl
veronica recognizes the car and instantly bends down to the open passenger window
where you bin
you bin cheatin on me
veronica opens the door and folds herself into the passenger seat
veronica knows the form
as truman pulls away from the curb she is already removing the lavender cardigan from the drycleaning bag on the back seat
she drapes the cardigan around her shoulders
bout time you got this thing cleaned
half joking dont tell me you bin makin your old lady wear it
truman passes her the brown paper bag without reply
veronica removes a bottle of perfume and proceeds to liberally apply it
examining the bottle god do they still make this stuff
whats the sell by date
from a vantage point in a disused tower high above the park
christof and chloe watch as trumans oldsmobile enters the park grounds and comes to a stop near the large metal framed globe the unisphere
both christof and chloe wear earpieces a miniature television propped at their feet shows a close up picture of truman and veronica inside the car
into a flip phone condescending you see him messing with the antenna
what did you think would happen
lapse of concentration is that what you call it
i call it amateur hour
sarcastic in case you hadnt noticed we dont get to do it over
christof totally unfazed regards his zealous young assistant with affection and even a mild amusement
as she hangs up querying the smile that plays around his lips you think this is funny
the mask has slipped before
everything can be explained
truman kills the lights and he and veronica exit the car unaware that they are being observed
adopting a more serious tone as he returns his attention to truman whats dangerous is that he makes the connection between what happened today and the girl we focus on
truman and veronica as they take a seat at the edge of the pool surrounding the great steel globe
like i say i dont normally do this
i gotta charge extra
truman nods his agreement and forks over several bills
veronica deposits the money in her purse and perches herself as modestly as possible on the edge of the fountain
when she is ready truman tenderly places his arm around her shoulder
veronica responds hesitantly becoming immersed in her role
she reaches out her own hand and rests it on the nape of his neck
slowly both heads drift together but stop just short of their lips meeting agonizingly close
so close they can feel each others breath barely a sliver of daylight separating them
then finally their lips touch in the most gentle of caresses
they hold the kiss for another long moment and then simultaneously break
as they look into each others eyes truman goes to say something but veronica hushes him by placing a finger to his lips
then abruptly she moves out of frame the cardigan falling from around her shoulders in her haste
from trumans pov we focus on the cardigan on the pavement triggering a flashback in his head
as with trumans previous flashbacks this scene appears to be playing on a television screen
however on this occasion it is also accompanied by christofs comments from his perch in the tower above the park
hes re created the event on and off for a number of years
weve never understood what prompts him to indulge the fantasy or for that matter what inspired such a painfully shy boy to approach her in the first place
a seventeen year old truman carrying a stack of books spies lauren sixteen going on thirty five wearing the lavender beaded cardigan at her open locker
she is entertaining two girlfriends with what appears to be a lewd tale
wed noticed them making eyes at each other for some weeks but never thought hed say anything
she was a year older wrote poetry way out of his league
truman obviously terrified musters the nerve to approach the lockers
the three girls look up surprised by the interruption
to lauren tongue tied a strangled greeting hi
to lauren as the two girlfriends abruptly depart see you in class
lauren is unsure whether or not to follow her friends
her name is carefully written in blue ink on the covers of her text books
ignoring her lack of interest look
i was wonder i cant go out with you
i havent asked you yet
well when you do thats my answer
softening im sorry
its not up to me
summoning up courage from somewhere why you married
lauren smiles despite herself
im not asking you to have my children just a pizza
how about saturday
lauren looks around the deserted school corridor
we got finals
if we dont go now it wont happen
impatient looking anxiously around well what do you want to do
the seventeen year old truman and lauren enter the park near the unisphere
the park is deserted on a hot june afternoon
we knew we were taking a risk
she hadnt been properly coached but we were torn
hed summoned the courage to make the approach
we wanted to reward that
of course she took full advantage
truman and lauren run up to the ledge of the pool surrounding the steel sculpture
i never knew this place existed
they both stare down at the inviting water
lauren suddenly throws off her cardigan and jumps into the pool without another thought
she comes splashing to the surface
truman stares down transfixed hy the shimmering water
lauren suddenly stops splashing
oh god im sorry
she quickly climbs out of the pool dripping wet
youve got nothing to be sorry about
has someone been talking to you
lauren wrings out her dress
to the sky upset get me out of here
i dont want to be here
lauren starts walking away
confused calling after her what are you talking about
truman runs after lauren and holds her by the arms forcing her to face him
distraught my names not lauren
truman looks into her eyes and believes her
truman and sylvia as she is now called throughout the remainder of the movie sit on the ledge of the pool the same spot as truman and the hooker veronica
seventeen years later
as we have just seen imitated sylvia and truman kiss with great delicacy
truman goes to say something but she covers his lips with her finger
in a minute someones going to come and stop me talking to you
looking around the deserted park who
theres no one around
covering his lips once again you remember when you were a little boy you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like magellan
and your teacher sister olivia said youre too late truman
theres nothing left to explore
and all the other kids laughed
and you sat down
incredulous how do you know about that
it doesnt matter
youve forgotten about that boy truman
you got scared
just because something happens doesnt mean you cant take another chance in your life
i dont understand
looking over her shoulder nervously there isnt much time
everybodys pretending truman
everybody but you
pointing to the buildings on the horizon look at that project
you think anybody lives there
its all for you truman
the eyes are everywhere
frustrated raving everywhere disguised
truman theyre going to fill your head with lies
youve got to make yourself deaf you understand
when youre afraid the most it means youre on the right track
trust that boy
promise me youll do that
truman nods unsure of the commitment he is making
suddenly a plymouth roars towards the fountain out of nowhere
scared i told you truman
the car skids to a stop and a large man ish with a shock of dark hair jumps from the car
the man yanks the frightened sylvia to her feet causing her cardigan to fall to the ground
to sylvia get in the car lauren
truman jumps up
to the man who are you
im her father
no hes not
hes just saying that
does he look anything like me
shut your mouth
the man backhands sylvia roughly across the face and bundles her into his car
truman rushes at the man
leave her alone
the man easily fends truman off knocking him to the ground
he slams shut the passenger door of the plymouth
to sylvia i told you not to come here anymore
to truman who is getting to his feet which one are you
truman is suddenly struck dumb the doubts start crowding back into his head
calling out from the car dont listen to him truman
make yourself deaf
come find me
to truman getting into the car dont bother
were moving to australia
new yorks done something to her head
the plymouth roars away
truman stares after it and then turns back to the cardigan left on the ground
why did he say australia
why couldnt he have said new jersey
veronicas head suddenly appears back in frame beside truman
you want me to do it again
i think i could do it better
coming back to reality no
truman picks up the cardigan
they return to the car
truman drives veronica back to her turf
she smokes a cigarette flicking ash out of the window
veronica what do you know for sure
taking a long drag on her cigarette as she gives the question due consideration the nuns at my school they used to say the whole of life is faith
truman regards his companion in a new light
he comes to a stop at the corner where he picked her up
giving truman an affectionate peck on the cheek on the house
another televised flashback
the seventeen year old truman stands reflectively beside sylvias open and vacated locker
we removed all physical trace of her but we couldnt erase the memory
in a secluded corner of the library the seventeen year old truman sits at a table surrounded by a stack of glossy womens magazines
by tearing out individual facial features eyes
nose mouth ears chin hair from photographs of young women in the magazines advertisements truman has been able to improvise a composite picture of sylvia
the montage is a passable likeness although truman is not completely satisfied with sylvias nose
he toys with several nose examples before reluctantly settling for one
he stares wistfully at the completed picture
seventeen year old truman enters the front door
his older sister raquel has been awaiting his arrival
when he decided to go after sylvia we were forced to intervene once again
excited ive got something to tell you sis
adopting a low serious tone ive got something to tell you too
unable to contain his news im going to australia
moms real sick
trumans face falls
as he enters the bedroom where his ill mother lies gazing at the ceiling we focus on his exchange student application that he has inadvertently crushed in his hands
truman turns into his street but stops several houses short of his own driveway and kills the cars engine
in the light of a streetlamp truman opens his briefcase and removes the framed photograph of his wife meryl
but he turns his wifes face away from him and opens the clasps on the back of the frame
removing the backing he exposes the composite picture of sylvia we witnessed in the flashback of his youth worn and faded by the years
with the frame on his lap truman retrieves a handful of paper fragments from his jacket
he tests the likeness of each one in turn
unsatisfied that any of the new noses is an improvement truman tosses them out of his car window
we watch the paper fragments blowing in the breeze as trumans car proceeds down the street and into his driveway
close up on a nose
we pull back to reveal that the nose belongs to sylvia seventeen years older than trumans composite picture slimmer in the face wearing her hair shorter
she is standing at the waters edge on a long deserted windswept beach several sailing dinghys pulled up beyond the high water line
in the background a solitary white beachfront house an other worldliness to the idyllic scene
looking up into the sky sylvias attention is drawn to a piece of paper carried on the ocean breeze
the paper catches on the mast of one of the sailing dinghys
a page from a newspaper carrying a photograph of truman in the street where he encountered his father
sylvia retrieves the page
the articles headline reads trumans fate in doubt
spying a man late thirties kindly face riding up to the beach house on an old bicycle sylvia secrets the page under her sweater
the man waves cheerfully as he comes to join her on the sand
sylvia waves cheerfully back
in a quiet bar a waitress patiently explains her viewpoint to the barman
a patron on a barstool eavesdrops
she was willing to lose him if it meant he could find himself
registering the barmans blank look never mind
truman sits in his car about to lace his coffee
from inside the adjacent elementary school gymnasium he hears the familiar excited squeals and shouts of school children
truman suddenly throws aside his miniature of jack daniels and sprints across the parking lot and into the school
truman slams through the front doors into the reception area
it is deserted no one stationed at the administration desk the corridors empty
he runs down a vacant corridor pushing open classroom doors as he goes
they are all unoccupied
finally he stands outside the gymnasium
the childrens voices can still be heard
truman takes a deep breath and bursts through the double doors
the room is empty save for a large reel to reel tape recorder in the middle of the basketball court playing a continuous tape of childrens voices
the recorder is attached to speakers on tall stands facing the ventilation ducts
truman stares at the machine in disbelief
truman exits the subway still lost in thought
he stops at the newstand and picks up a copy of vanity fair to resume his ritual search but his heart is not in it
he starts his trek to work pausing to stare at his reflection in the mirrored building hoping that the homeless man will appear at his side once again
but no one joins him
however as truman continues to stare it is the building itself that takes his interest
an imposing forty story office building a black sheer mirrored box clad in the kind of reflective glass that shields its occupants from the world a building truman passes every
as usual a steady stream of employees and visitors enter and exit the buildings high ceilinged lobby past an intimidating security desk manned by two uniformed guards
beyond security are banks of elevators ferrying executives clerical staff and delivery personnel to and from their floors of business
truman abruptly enters the building
he strides confidently past the security desk trying to look as if he belongs
to truman can i help
sneaking a glance at the building directory i have an appointment at er
they went bust
the second security guard is rising from his seat to block trumans path to the elevators but truman reads his mind and makes a dash for it
he slips into an elevator just as the doors are closing defeating the flailing arm of the pursuing guard
a woman executive in the elevator looks in horror at truman
the cause of her concern becomes all too apparent
looking beyond the woman truman discovers that there is no back to the elevator car
the elevator is simply an opening into the body of the building
truman pushes past the woman to be confronted with the fact that the entire office block is nothing but a giant empty shell with no floors above the ground floor
the people truman has just witnessed entering the other elevators are milling around a refreshment table sitting on folding chairs changing their clothes behind temporary curtained cubicles or lining up
to re enter the bogus elevator cars
gradually they all turn to gape at truman who in turn stares back appalled
the security guards suddenly appear at trumans side and take him by the arm
you gotta leave
riveted by the equally stunned building occupants whatre they doing
you gotta leave
the guards frog march truman out of the huge facade towards an emergency exit
not going quietly just tell me what the hells going on
were re modelling
whatre they doing
truman continues to struggle as the guards usher him to the street
you dont tell me ill get you investigated
truman sees there is no point in arguing further
his shouts are attracting the interest of passers by
a thought occurs to him
he starts to run along the street suddenly entering another building at random
an office block with a bank on the ground floor
as he skirts the bank he feels the eyes of the bank staff and customers on him
is he so suspicious looking or were they expecting him
truman rushes to the elevators
the lights above the doors show all the elevators on upper floors
frantic pressing of the elevator button gets no response
truman heads for the stairs but is intercepted by a bank official who bars his way
you cant anticipating his response i know
truman backs away out of the office and continues to run down the streets of lower manhattans financial district
every building he encounters seems to have a security guard anticipating his arrival or a building official hanging a closed for business sign on the front door
he feels the eyes of pedestrians
is he simply drawing attention to himself by his behavior
truman wheels around trying to make eye contact with passers by
they shy away
truman stops still his head reeling
from the office window on the twelfth floor truman can observe the glass building down the street
he ponders the black mirrored box
lawrence appears at his side
you ever been into the amt building
following trumans gaze not since they begun reconstruction
referring to the file in trumans hands whatre you doing with that
defensive im going to visit a site
because i never do
placing a hand on trumans arm thats why we got adjusters
looking at lawrences hand on his arm you got a problem with me going
i got a problem with you not doing your job burbank
you already screwed up once this week
let me worry about that
truman exits with the report
after waiting only a matter of seconds for an elevator he impatiently enters the stairwell
as soon as he disappears from sight a grim christof emerges from a nearby office shadowed as always by chloe
they approach lawrence with the familiarity of business associates
chloe opens a flip phone to make a call
an out of breath truman arrives on the second floor landing of the stairwell to find two burly movers blocking his path with a large office desk they are attempting
truman considers retracing his steps then without warning clambers over the mahogany barrier
hey would it kill ya to wait
truman paces impatiently on an empty subway platform with other frustrated passengers
he loses patience and suddenly turns and runs up the stairs
truman sits seething in a traffic jam that exists for no apparent reason
impatiently to driver is there another way
cant you get around this
truman exits his taxi and takes in the scene
a partially burnt building waterlogged still faintly smoldering
truman checks the address on his file
a small serious looking boy straddles his bicycle on the sidewalk
to the boy when was the fire
shrug week ago
how come its still smoking
started up again
referring to his claims report says here it burnt to the ground
wishful thinking maybe
the boy is wise well beyond his years
truman fixes him with a glare
someone send you to tell me all this
unfazed you the one askin questions
the boy casually rides away
truman wanders aimlessly through a city park observing
we sense truly observing for the first time
a group of youths play a pick up game of basketball
a young woman walks a pair of afghan hounds
an old man answers the incessant questions of his grandchild
nothing appears amiss
truman stands amidst a throng of tourists and commuters marooned on times square
mesmerized by the two fast moving rivers of vehicles flowing through the intersection
truman stares down at the street contemplating stepping out into the traffic
however as his foot is poised the stream of cars that passed so close by seconds earlier now appear to be giving him a wider berth
he steps off the sidewalk and
to an acompaniment of car horns begins to wander back and forth without fear through the traffic confident that each vehicle will take evasive action
safely on the other side of the street he stands in front of the window of an electronics store
he watches a local tv news show covering the santa maria replica moored near pier
however truman is forced to look away when he glimpses his own face on another tv taking a feed from a camcorder aimed out the store window
he shudders at his video reflection
trumans face stares out from a televison monitor
we slowly pull back to reveal that other smaller monitors surround the first until we find ourselves staring at a video wall in a room the size of a football
the curved bank of monitors suspended by cables from the ceiling gives the appearance of a giant patch work mobile
investigating the screens we discover surveillance pictures from all over new york city covering every facet of trumans life
camera angles from the interior of trumans house his backyard car subway station office the deli he frequents the seashore to which he is drawn the park he visits with
veronica the abandoned freeway where he golfs with marlon many of the locations strangely devoid of people
beneath the video wall is a state of the art mixing desk its illuminated buttons glowing brightly in the gloom
facing the desk several operators in high backed high tech swivel chairs wearing the slimmest of headsets
simeon a meticulous young man with a penetrating gaze sits directly in front of the largest of the monitors co ordinating camera angles
christof stands over simeons shoulder staring intently at the live picture of truman now seated at a streetside cafe continuing to inspect his surroundings
chloe hovers in the background
there is an uncomfortable silence in the control room as the production crew feel themselves under scrutiny for the first time
christof leans forward and talks soothingly into a microphone on the control panel
everybody stay focused
remember who you are
truman sits alone at the table still looking for a false move
a delivery man unloads boxes from the back of his truck and carries them into a restaurant supply store
further down the street construction workers take their time tending to an electrical repair in an exposed manhole
a postal worker does his rounds
an old woman struggles with two heavy shopping bags
everybody appears natural places to go
truman turns his attention to a group of italian looking men at the only other occupied table at the cafe
we see extreme close ups as truman scans the mens faces for any sign of phoniness
they are talking loudly making suggestive comments to the waitress and generally showing off like schoolboys
their behavior passes the test all seems genuine
truman idly regards his three stone wedding ring with which he has been fidgeting
the on air monitor shows truman from the rings pov revealing that the small center diamond contains a miniature hidden camera
truman suspects nothing
he looks up to find two well to do oggers out for a lunchtime run making their way down the street towards the cafe
truman happens to glance at the sneakers of one of the joggers
he springs to his feet and blocks the joggers path
staring at the monitor damn
unseen by christof his assistant director simeon takes a moment of pleasure from the older mans distress
to the jogger with the familiar sneakers small world
attempting to sidestep truman excuse me
truman blocks the man a second time
you dont remember
two days ago i gave you my meatball sandwich in the park
you were in a wheelchair
an almost subliminal flashback appears in trumans head confirming that the jogger and the homeless man in the wheelchair two days earlier are one and the same
commenting ironically on his new found mobility a miracle
coming to his companions aid get the hell outta here
the second jogger pushes truman back against the cafe table causing him to stumble
marlon is loading boxes of candy into the back of his van
truman hurries up to him
ive gotta talk to you
sorry im up against it today
ive fallen over something marlon
something to do with my dad
looking at him for the first time are you okay
you look like shit
ignoring the inquiries about his health its big marlon
you wouldnt believe whos in on it
distracted in on what
theres no point trying to show you they cover their tracks too well
but ive been going into a lotta strange buildings seeing a lotta familiar faces yknow what i mean
still engrossed in his own problems somethings definitely in the air
my last delivery a kid got crushed to death
tilting a vending machine
they wont even let me take the rest of the day off
do it anyway
marlon scoffs at the suggestion then realizes truman isnt joking
im deadly serious
we cant talk here
im being followed
suddenly concerned who
i dont know
they look just like regular people
producing a notebook from his jacket pocket but ive been writing down numbers license plates taxi numbers id numbers the same ones keep cropping up over and over
is someone leanin on you tru
cos i got some friends here they owe me
we can lean back
pointing out a taxi parked outside the yard is he one of them
anxious i dont know
one things certain
the key is spontoneity
they cant stand that
thats why weve got to get outta here
can you come with me
weakening christ truman
youre gonna get both our asses fired
marlon shuts his van and gets in
truman enters the passenger side
wherere we going
christof is in deep conversation with two executives
moses a contemporary of christof but more jaded and debauched looking and roman a fresh faced younger man
chloe hovers in the background
a monitor suspended from the ceiling shows a surveillance shot of truman and marlon pulling into a beach parking lot in marlons van
the glass conference room looks out onto the vast control facility where simeon continues to call the shots all too aware of the closed door discussion taking place in the
marveling excitedly referring to truman on the monitor i cant believe how much hes shoved down
that he sensed the significance at aged seven and clung to it so fiercely
roman paces agitated unimpressed
moses mnore respectful
gesturing to the clifftop on the monitor pointedly excluding roman from the conversation you remember moses it used to end right there before the expansion
unable to contain his anxiety any longer christof the cracks are starting to show
reassuring keeping himself in check ill paper over them
coming to the defense of her mentor trumans had bouts of paranoia before and recovered
adamant faintly hysterical no not like this
too much for christof
he wheels on the young man
is that what you have trouble watching
perhaps you dont like watching yourself
roman is stung into silence
realizing his colleague is in over his head including chloe to save romans face why dont you two wait outside
reluctantly roman and chloe exit and join simeon at the video wall
instantly more comfortable in the company of a man his own age hes jumped the rails moses thats all
well get him back on
you know why theyre so nervous
the birth of trumans child is going to double revenue
for gods sake dont let him upstage you
indicating simeon through the glass walls youve been grooming a successor
hes not ready
him or you
jaw setting firm referring to truman on the monitor you cant pull him back in without me
more reflective hes just acting out of character
what if hes in character
what if hes starting to act in character at last
have you ever considered that
truman runs down the beach towards the cliff he attempted to scale as a seven year old boy
truman sits on the clifftop staring out at the view his father had been so desperate for him not to see twenty seven years earlier
however the deserted bay beyond is exactly as his father described almost identical to its neighbor
marlon laboring crests the rise and joins his friend on the clifftop
whatre we doing here truman
this is where it started
where what started
things that dont fit
slips of the tongue
irritated make sense truman
you going religious on me
tears of bitterness welling in his eyes my father didnt want me to see what was over here
whatever it was its gone now
i never shoulda listened to him that day
i knew it was wrong
we see a quick flashback of seven year old truman on the cliff face twenty seven years earlier
there were a hundred people on the beach that day
everybody knew what was going on except me
i dont want to put you down but why would anybody go to all this trouble over you
maybe ive been mistaken for somebody else
a memory triggered a couple of years ago i tried to get hold of a copy of time magazine
the week before an ad said next week truman burbank and the lost generation
marlon shrugs unimpressed
a guy with the same name as me in time magazine
it aint a common name so i looked out for it
but the day it came out every newstand was sold out
no library had it
i even wrote off for a back issue
never seen a copy to this day
marlon remains unconvinced
maybe im being set up for something
you ever feel like that marlon
like your whole life has been building to something
marlon looks skeptically at truman
he hasnt had that feeling
becoming testy a coincidence
havent you ever heard of a coincidence
im a walking coincidence
i cant count em
no somethings happening marlon
ive got to get to the bottom of it
shaking his head in exasperation of what
whyre you doing this to yourself
im scared marlon
im as scared as hell
but ive never felt more alive
its just like she said
suddenly intrigued who
it doesnt matter
she was too beautiful for here
now marlon is really confused
can you lend me some money
a hundred bucks
all i got on me is the takings from the machines
why do you need it
im going away for a while
the comfortably furnished room of a writer
walls lined with books
desk overlooking the sea strewn with notes photos and other reference material
sylvias name on the spine of several published volumes
pages of unfinished manuscript handwritten in blue ink
sylvia stands at a bookcase looking for inspiration
as she pulls out a book a magazine falls to the floor
trumans missing copy of time magazine
his face on the cover with the headline truman burbank and the lost generation
sylvia retrieves the magazine
in front of a nearby mirror she holds trumans photographed face next to her own for a moment imagining them together
then catching herself she quickly lowers the magazine left alone with her own reflection
we see trumans disturbed face reflected in the screen of his television set montaged over that of robin leach host of lifestyles of the rich and famous
meryl wearing her robe head against trumans chest sips from a bottle of beer
attempting to open him up whats going on truman
youre not yourself
vague maybe you just dont know me very well
christof eats a sumptuous meal in an ornate private dining room with an elegant woman thirty years his junior
playing silently on a monitor on an antique side table is a surveillance shot of truman and meryl slumped in front of their television
chloe enters the room and nods an apology to christofs dinner companion a woman her own age
christofs companion shrugs resignedly
christof registers chloes thinly disguised resentment enjoying the rivalry
chloe inserts a cassette tape into a nearby vcr
christof wipes his mouth with his napkin and picks up his wine glass as he gives the television his full attention
a commercial for global travel begins to play
truman continues to watch lifestyles restlessly
however as he goes to get up from the sofa meryl starts to slide down his chest towards his lap
we could do it right here like we used to
the program cuts to a commercial break
the commercial is for global travel
from television travelling down under
global travel is turning rates to australia upside down
round trip to sydney only
global travel at broadway and th
truman perks up at the commercial while meryls attention is elsewhere
abruptly getting up lemme go to the bathroom
dont be too long
truman exits the living room
however on his way to the bathroom he hesitates at the kitchen table
he surreptitiously lifts the platic coated plaid tablecloth to reveal numerous bills laid out flat beneath it to keep the stash hidden
chloe pulls back long white silk drapes to reveal a spectacular view overlooking the hollywood hills
christof rouses from his enormous round bed
his dinner companion also stirs waving coyly to chloe as she modestly covers herself only mildly perturbed by the intrusion
chloe switches on the television set in the extravagent bedroom
playing on the set are truman and meryl still fast asleep in their own bed
what happened overnight
he couldnt do it even on the sofa
smiling to himself god that thing of his must be psychic
matter of fact he didnt masturbate
not for the last two inonths
chloe exits and christof climbs out of bed
meryl emerges from the bathroom ready for work surprised to find truman sitting at the kitchen table
rubbing ointment into her wrists arent you gonna be late
i got a call in the area
nodding to her wrists whats the case
dispassionate rape on the subway
trumans eyes widen
we see a quick flashback in trumans head of the two youths assaulting the woman on his train
theyre guilty as hell but theyll walk
her word against theirs
picking up her bag to leave maybe we could meet for lunch today
meryl gives him an affectionate kiss and exits the back door
truman waits for the sound of meryls car to disappear down the road and exits himself
truman enters the courtroom building
a crush of defendents families attorneys and police officers
truman goes to enter a courtroom but a security guard blocks his path
you a witness
suddenly losing heart no no im not
before the guard can move him on
truman sneaks a look at proceedings through the courtroom door window
he recognizes the two youths sitting at the defendents table
a prosecutor is on his feet addressing the jury
meryl is working attentively at her stenotype machine her fingers rapidly pressing the keys
however truman notices a glaring omission
there is no paper emerging from meryls machine
the roll of paper tape sits on the floor beside her chair leg
the employees and customers inside global travel are all doing a last minute primp fixing their hair and checking their clothes
suddenly in unison they take their positions and begin working
as truman enters global travel one customer looks up a fraction too quickly anticipating his arrival
truman takes a seat at the only unoccupied desk opposite a female travel agent
feeling uneasy about a surveillance camera in the corner of the room he nervously obscures his face with his hand
i wanna book a flight to australia
believing she is being deliberately obtuse australia
a trace of condescension where in australia
entering the destination in her computer for how many
finding the question suspicious one
when do you want to leave remembering of course that you do lose a day on the way there
more urgent than he intended today
reading off her computer screen im sorry
i dont have anything for a week
suspicious a week
patiently explaining its the busy season
paranoia showing you sure youre not trying to keep me here
you are a travel agent arent you
your job is to help people travel not keep em where they are
pointing to the agents name tag doris travel agent or maybe youre a different kind of agent doris
showing amazing restraint i do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for australia tomorrow
but you wouldnt want to do that
why wouldnt i
i thought you were in a hurry
calming down thats right
you want to book the flight
truman pulls out a wad of money from his pocket and several rolls of quarters from marlons vending machines
the agent looks askance at the pile of cash
you were expecting me werent you
the travel agent ignores the question and prints the ticket
its non refundable
christof stands with a production manager mid thirties on the forecourt of the sydney opera house its sail like roofs soaring above them
framing the background the coathanger shaped sydney harbor bridge
unable to conceal his pride happy
christof gives a grudgingly complimentary nod
staring out at the pleasure craft littering the harbor can we contain him long enough
i think so
christof looks skyward at the cottonwool clouds above the harbor
anticipating his next question he flies at night
thick cloud cover to disorient him
hopefully well knock him out with complimentary cocktails pull the shades down during the movies
hell never know
christof gives another grudging nod of approval
the production manager is beckoned by a group of construction workers who are putting the finishing touches to a corner of the opera house
chloe drifts to christofs side a watchman tv in her hand
referring to the surrounding scene why go to all the trouble
christof glances at the tv screen in her hand showing truman sitting in his office gazing at his composite picture of sylvia
he believes she has the answer
why not just tell him shes dead
its too late for that
that wont satisfy him
hes going to have to find out for himself
see it with his own eyes
right now he needs something genuine
rueful all too aware of the contradiction even if we have to fake it
close up on typewriting appearing on a page
please accept my resignation from american life accident inc
to take effect immediately
yours tru truman gets up from the typewriter in mid word and strolls to a fellow agents desk
to agent picking up a dictionary yours truly
you spell truly l
y or l
i always write yours faithfully
truman finds the appropriate page in the dictionary and gazes at the entry for a long moment
he looks up staring into the middle distance
his eyes widen as something clicks in his mind
suddenly lawrence snatches the dictionary from his hand
where the hell have you been burbank
what the hells going on
thats what id like to know lawrence
the agents in the other cubicles turn in their direction
i was just about to resign
isnt that a laugh
i just realized theres nothing to resign from is there
listen dont bother with the resignation
just get the fuck outta here
addressing the whole office whyre you all pretending
gesturing to a computer terminal what is this a front for
why arent i in on the joke
was i away that day
noting two colleagues exchanging a look he pulls the computer off the desk to get their attention
it lands on the floor with an expensive crash
hysterical im talking to you
who am i
taken aback by the sudden violent act you better get outta here or im calling security
im calling security
truman picks up the framed photograph from his desk containing sylvias hidden likeness
suddenly he wheels on lawrence pinning him to a cubicle wall
you dont believe a single word youre saying
to the assembled group none of you do
suddenly talking to a sprinkler head in the ceiling you hear me
we see trumans manic face from the sprinkler heads pov
truman stomps off down the corridor other insurance agents giving him a wide berth
he shoves computers desk lamps and pot holders off desks as he goes
truman steps out of the office suddenly able to breathe again pleased to be outdoors despite the gloomy sky overhead
christof is once again standing at the picture window in the dimly lit control room where we first encountered him
behind him the fronds of the palm tree sway in a gentle breeze
the sky a cloudless cobalt blue in sharp contrast to the overcast day in new york city
simeon co ordinating camera angles sits in front of the largest of the monitors that shows a live picture of truman stuck in his car in gridlock
talking quietly into a slim headset and back to the close up
chloes attention is focused on a subsidiary monitor displaying a freeze frame of truman reading the dictionary a few minutes earlier
to a hard bitten operator staring at the dictionary do you think he sees the entry
hard to tell
sarcastic why dont we ask him
snapping back referring to the book i dont know how it got there
to operator enhance
christof turns his back on the screen and stares out the window
we focus on an enhanced picture of the dictionarys text
in fact really
trumanesque sk a
characteristic of the experiences of truman burbank a trumanesque town conversation etc
playing truman drives erratically down a quiet suburban street
on the sidewalk up ahead he spies a young mother pushing an infant in a baby carriage
truman suddenly swerves sharply and jumps the curb in front of the mother and child the car straddling the sidewalk
he has the drivers door open almost before the oldsmobile has come to a halt
truman dashes from the car and plucks the infant from the carriage while the mother stands rooted to the spot
the startled infant immediately begins to wail as truman holds the crying bundle in both hands above his head
to the mother motioning to the sidewalk say my name or ill smash its head open
the young mother frozen with fright does not reply
vehement say my name
composing herself reaching out for her child please give him to me
screaming above the babys cries say my name
you know my name
bewildered i dont know you
the commotion has attracted the attention of an old man across the street watering his garden
he drops his hose and hurries towards the fracas
halfway across the street the old man stops in his tracks as he sees the baby perilously poised in the air
hysterical i mean it
im ready to do it
whats my name
truman lifts the screaming baby as far above his head as he can his arms shaking fighting the urge to dash the fragile innocent to the concrete
we see a view of the scene from the pov of a streetlight
the young mother recognizing trumans seriousness opens her mouth to speak but no sound comes
entreating the young woman tears in his eyes this is your last chance
the anguish in his voice convinces us that truman is truly on the brink
the young woman now has tears rolling down her cheeks
she is at a loss powerless
his entire body shaking what
the young woman mumbles but is unable to supply the name
truman arms shaking face red with rage realizes he cant go through with it
with everything he has he gathers himself
after what seems like an age he ever so slowly lowers the child into the safety of the mothers outstretched arms
clutching the baby to her breast without thinking thank you truman
truman shudders at the sound of his name and backs away from the young woman as if it is she who now represents the threat
he jumps into his car and slams it into gear driving over the sidewalk and back onto the street
the young woman and the old man stare after trumans car as it roars away
as truman drives he stares paranoid at seemingly innocuous features in his oldsmobile his rearview mirror steering wheel insignia speedometer airconditioning ducts and peers up at the streetlamps lining the
a dozen or so of sylvias friends including the man we have seen before sit around a table on the balcony in the afternoon sun talking animatedly
a ten year old son of one of the guests has strayed into the living room and switched on the television set hidden away in an antique bureau
emerging from the kitchen is taken aback by what she sees playing on the screen
the man on the balcony catches her look as she swiftly switches off the tv
she gently takes the childs hand and leads him outside
truman staring at the freeway from the bottom of the garden
doesnt bother to look up as meryl approaches
referring to a distant car on the expressway see that car way down there
i bet its a suburu station wagon
meryl looks idly over the fence at the approaching car
finally a suburu station wagon motors by
meryl is unimpressed
truman turns his back on the expressway to continue his game
i predict the next four cars will be a white honda civic a blue and white dodge dart with the front hubcap missing a volkswagon beetle with a dented fender
and a motorcycle
meryl doesnt wish to participate in the game and makes for the house
truman holds her arm forcing her to watch
he turns to check his prediction
a convoy of cars approaches
theres the honda
here comes the dented beetle
meryls attention wavers
truman tightens his grip
look damn you
following the vw is a school bus
mocking wheres the motorcycle
truman is momentarily disappointed
meryl seizes her chance and heads for the house
truman follows her inside
yelling after her dont you want to know how i did that
maybe you already know
is that it
behind trumans back a motorcycle putters by
meryl is pouring herself ice tea when truman enters
where have you been
ive been calling you all day
have you been concerned meryl
i always liked it
matching his sarcasm nice of you to say so after eight years
actresss name isnt it
whats your real name
rolling her eyes oh god
whats got into you
take a break
meryl a knowing almost foolish grin know
i invited marlon and rita for a barbeque sunday
i thought id make my potato salad
irritated drop it i said
rambling on we need more charcoal
im gonna take a shower
catching her wrist no
were going for a drive
despite her protests truman drags meryl out the back door and towards his car
as he shoves her into the oldsmobile for years ive been saying i want to go some place well now im ready to go
lets just jump in the car and go
truman holds meryls wrist to stop her exiting the car and accelerates out of the driveway in reverse without looking
as they speed down the suburban street i thought maybe atlantic city
trying to mask her anxiety you hate gambling
i do dont i
so why do you wanna go
cos i never have
thats why you go places isnt it
cos youre curious
i havent been curious since i was seven years old yknow that
back then youd have to nail me to the floor to keep me in one place
all eyes watch the large monitor as surveillance cameras track trumans speeding car
how long to take atlantic city out of mothballs
we could be up and running
three hours maybe
give me a number five gridlock on the jersey turnpike
truman and meryl are hemmed in by a traffic snarl on the new jersey turnpike
we observe the oldsmobile on a television lens from the pov of a tail light on the car ahead
a manic edge to his voice so much traffic this time of day
does that strike you as peculiar
on the side of the road two motorists are arguing over a minor collision
sneering at the sight of the motorists look at them
you believe theyre fighting
i dont believe it
shouting out the window to the motorists why dont you slug him really make it authentic
without warning truman suddenly exits the freeway
but his move is anticipated
at the end of the offramp a pack of cars suddenly appears
other vehicles fill the gap behind
to meryl marveling blocked at every turn
beautifully synchronized dont you agree
incredulous you blaming me for the traffic
should youve never been on this road before
you dont know what its like
manic thats true
we could be stuck here for hours
could be like this all the way to atlantic city
truman suddenly veers the oldsmobile onto the sidewalk
what the hell are you doing
lets go back
i dont know what got into me
truman rejoins the new jersey turnpike heading back towards queens the roadway now relatively free of traffic
would you please slow down truman
truman floors the oldsmobile
the car flies past the exit for route
he continues along the jersey turnpike
truman that was the turnoff
ive changed my mind again
whats maine like this time of year
ive never been to maine
truman looks up through the windshield at a helicopter tracking his progress or lets just see where the road takes us
pleading let me out truman
youre not right in the head
you wanna destroy yourself you do it on your own
eerily calm i think id like a little company
christof chloe simeon and the other operators follow trumans progress from a helicopter shot the oldsmobile optically circled to ease identification
christof jabs his finger at the rapidly thinning traffic surrounding trumans vehicle
to simeon what the hell is wrong with the carousel
keep them together
agitated theyre rusty
we cant keep up
rueful aside we dont know where hes going any more
oncoming is very thin
as he speeds erratically truman glances at the streets either side of the freeway where he discovers a distinct lack of moving traffic
to the anxious meryl at his side look down there meryl
i dont run into traffic
the traffic follows me around
excited by his discovery were in a moving pack dont you see
truman abruptly exits the rapidly emptying freeway
enthusing hes so close
you want to pull him over
we shadow him
we dont want him to panic
hes trying to outrun the traffic
hes trying to outrun the world
keep him on this route
to simeon who is consulting someone on his headset are we ready
executives moses and roman have entered the control room
they hover nervously in the background
truman is forced to slow once again behind a line of other cars at a police roadblock
at the head of the line the cars are being turned around by police officers who are also contending with a swarm of news reporters and television crews
to meryl its hard to go places isnt it
theres been an accident truman
we have to go back
theres no accident
its just more stalling
truman slows beside a police officer
whats going on
grim faced indicating the nearby indian point nuclear power plant leak at the plant
they had to shut her down
is there any way around
the whole areas being evacuated
truman falls in line behind the cars making a u turn when all of a sudden he guns his car and swerves past the barricade
in the twilight sun sylvias guests wander up the gravel path leading away from the beach house the younger children carried in their parents arms
hanging back from the rest of the group sylvias admirer wheeling his bicycle turns back to the house
as the man is about to lean his bicycle against the side of the beach house he looks in a window
lit by a blue glow sylvia sits transfixed by the television playing in her antique bureau the screen obscured from our view
she is unaware of the mans face at the window
recognizing what is playing on the screen the man regards sylvia with a resigned smile
he mounts the bicycle and rides back up the path
trumans car slides to a stop blocked by hazardous waste vehicles straddling the roadway leading up to the power plant the pursuing police car blocking his retreat
truman flees the car leaving meryl in the passenger seat
truman bursts past the alien looking hazardous waste workers in their protective suits carrying detection instruments
the workers give chase in their cumbersome suits trying to cut off his path to the power plant
as he crests a slight rise beyond the plant he is finally tackled to the ground
however peering through the long grass truman is able to make out the lights of a cityscape in the distance
christof a trace of panic in his eyes turning to chloe
did he see it
i dont think so
the reason for christofs concern becomes all too apparent as the helicopter passes over the power plant where the struggling truman is being escorted away
we see an aerial shot from the helicopter as it emerges directly above the sydney skyline
meryl and truman sit at their kitchen table
truman stoic tears rolling down meryls cheeks
trumans airline ticket torn to shreds on the table in front of them
let me get you some help truman
youre not well
ignoring her tears and medical advice why do you want to have a child with me
you cant stand me
thats not true
suddenly angry dont lie to me
trumans raised voice backs meryl to her feet
truman follows getting in her face
tell me whats happening
frightened but remaining poised i thought you knew everything
what could i tell you
backing her up against the kitchen bench youre part of this arent you
meryl grabs a kitchen knife from a wooden block to protect herself
truman youre scaring me
truman looks in her eyes and with surprising swiftness grabs her wrist and disarms her
no youre scaring me meryl
truman grabs meryl by the hair and turns the knife on her
while pressing the blade to meryls throat truman starts to march her around the room talking to the walls light fixtures a mirror doorknob framed picture blank television
stop this now or i kill your leading lady
to a lamp i know you can hear me
christof and the others watch the monitors spellbound as truman looks directly into one camera lens after another
roman is the first to crack
entreating christof get somebody in there
quiet but firm no
siding with the executive showing his true colors shes in trouble
weve got to help her
christof never taking his eyes from the monitor leans into the microphone
we see an extreme close up of meryls ear
unheard by truman from her inner car we hear a familiar voice
call his bluff
in reply to the voice in her head half strangled due to the pressure of the knife do something
upon hearing her remark trumans eyes widen
sensing that she too is addressing a third person he jerks her head around to read her face
wild eyed who are you talking to
incredulous youre the one talking to the walls
you said do something
who were you talking to
i swear ill kill you if you dont tell me
meryl takes the chance to spin out of his grasp and dashes to the bedroom but before she can barricade the door truman forces his way inside
they both tumble onto the waterbed causing it to rock back and forth
gripping meryls hair truman throws aside the bed covers
distraught referring to the bed how could you buy this damn thing when you know he drowned in front of me
truman raises the kitchen knife but instead of stabbing meryl begins to slash viciously at the waterbed opening a large gash
you have any idea what its like to drown
truman drops the knife and forces meryls head into the gaping hole in the bed submerging her head in the tepid water
she thrashes her arms wildly trying to free herself
truman reluctantly jerks her head back out of the water
gasping for air truman stop it
to the ceiling dont let him do it
to a light fixture threatening ill kill her
he dunks her head into the water a second time holding her head down longer this time
she continues to struggle
suddenly the front door chimes
startled truman lets meryl up for air
sneering at meryl right on time
cops must be telepathic
meryl spots the kitchen knife within her reach but truman beats her to it
grabbing the knife by the blade he slices his hand
wincing in pain damn
at knifepoint truman marches meryl down the hallway to the front door
the doorbell chimes a second and third time more insistently
shouting through the closed door stay where you are or ill kill her
its me marlon
he was so convinced it would be the police
he takes a step back against the hallway wall
before he can decide what to do marlon has opened the unlocked front door to be confronted with the sight of truman holding the knife to meryls throat blood streaming
from his own wound
marlon locks eyes on truman
sizing up the situation he slowly but decisively removes the knife from trumans hand
meryl wrenches herself free from trumans now limp grasp and collapses into marlons arms sobbing
distraught dropping character forgetting herself they were going to let him kill me
marlon and truman both nursing bottles of beer sit on the end of their abandoned freeway off ramp
people know who i am my every move complete strangers know my name
even when theres no one around i feel the eyes on me
reluctant admission i was in the bank today
the federal on lewis
a clerk was talking about somebody named truman messing with her baby
is that the stranger youre talking about
truman closes his eyes as he takes in the explanation
half to himself refusing to accept it no
ive never seen her before
registering marlons skepticism i know you already think im going out of my mind but i genuinely believe the world revolves around me somehow
everybody seems to be in on it
its a lot of world for one man
you sure thats not wishful thinking you wishing youd made something more of yourself
christ truman who hasnt sat on the john and had an imaginary interview with barbara walters
who hasnt wanted to be somebody
thats just it
i think i am somebody
sympathetizing i used to dream all my friends and family got together in a hotel room thinking of ways to fuck me up
sometimes i think its in my head sometimes i think its for real
marlon looks around as if drawing inspiration from somewhere in the night
tru weve known each other since before we could get a hard on
truman half smiles at the ribald remark
the only way we ever made it through high school was cheating off each others test papers
jesus they were identical
i always liked that because whatever the answer was we was right together and we was wrong together
truman nods fondly at the memory
the only night either of us ever spent in jail we spent together and i wet myself but you never told anyone
i was best man at your wedding and my brother was best man at my wedding and you didnt talk to me for a month over that and i didnt
blame you because youve been more of a brother to me than hes ever been
and i never shoulda let my goddam father talk me into that
truman is slowly coming around
marlons speech from the heart soothing away his pain
i know things havent worked out for either of us like we used to sit up on freemont street all night and dream they would
we all let opportunities pass us by none of us asks for the dance as often as we should
i know that feeling when its like everythings slipping away and you dont want to believe it so you look for answers someplace else
but well the point is i would gladly step in front of traffic for you
truman grins a melancholy grin nearly all the way back
we see a close up of marlons ear
from inside unheard by truman christof dictates marlons heartfelt speech
christof leans over a microphone at the mixing desk feeding the lines to marlon immersed in the role
hushed tones and the last thing id ever do is lie to you
recognizing the importance of the moment his colleagues stand around in awe at christofs spontaneous performance arguably superior to marlons own delivery
staring into trumans eyes repeating the words in his ear and the last thing id ever do is lie to you
pause think about it truman if everybodys in on it id have to be in on it too
im not in on it cos there is no it
trumans head slowly drops in surrender his doubts draining away
marlon embraces truman in a bearhug
truman looks over his shoulder to the sky where a single star shines
from his chair christof modestly accepts the congratulations of his colleagues
the two executives moses and roman are at the head of the line their earlier disagreement suddenly forgotten
chloe gives christof a warm hug
marlon accepting a towel from a p
still in wardrobe approaches and kneels beside the arm of christofs chair
grasping his hand
leaving his head close to christof i cant thank you enough
i dont know what happened
he was so close
it threw me
christof gives marlon a consoling pat on the shoulder and marlon withdraws
finally christofs assistant director simeon approaches and offers his hand
christof hesitates before shaking
simeon returns to the monitors now showing truman alone at the dock or long island
christof stares out the window to conceal an expression of quiet vindication
the two old women we have seen before sit on their sofa gazing straight ahead
on the teievision in front of them a live picture of truman the first time we have seen him broadcast to a viewers set
he is reading a book at his kitchen table unaware of the cameras recording him
the scene alternates between a wide master shot a medium tight shot a close up of trumans face and two insert shots one over the shoulder shot of the page
he is reading and one from another angle showing the books title to the ends of the earth the age of exploration
at one point a sponsors border appears on screen tastefully framing the action with the message folgers coffee good to the last drop
after several seconds the border disappears
suddenly tbe live picture of truman shrinks into a window on the screen to accomodate a title sequence that begins to piay around the edge of the image
overlapping scenes from trumans life appear in chronological order from infancy to adolescence and finally adulthood
a graphic truman total record of a human life appears on screen accompanied by an introductory narration
you are watching truman total record of a human life
everything that occurs here is real
there are no re creations or interruptions
due to the live and unedited nature of the program viewer discretion is advised
the title sequence is replaced by an interviewer mid fifties conservative suit and hair sitting opposite christof in a larry king style interview setting
projected in the background is the live picture of truman immersed in his book
to camera welcome to week seventeen hundred and sixty eight of truman and there can scarcely have been a more momentous week in the shows history
im your host michael conners and this is a special edition of tru talk the forum where we discuss and analyze recent events with the shows award winning creator and
referring to the image of truman in the background i remind viewers that as this is a living history it is our practise to keep the image of truman on
screen at all times
turning to christof welcome
before we start taking calls the huge surge in ratings over the last few days how do you hope to sustain that audience now that truman appears to have reconciled
himself returned to normal
ratings have never been our primary goal
i imagine well lose those voycurs only interested in witnessing trumans latest torment
however im certain our core audience will remain loyal
but recent events have been so dramatic it does raise the perennial question
what keeps us watching one man twenty four hours a day eating sleeping working sitting for hours in contemplation
it has to be the reality
during this segment we cut to a cross section of viewers the nightwatchmen the two old women on their sofa the barman and the waitress listening to christofs theories on
their viewing habits
weve become increasingly frustrated watching actors give us phony emotions bored with pyrotechnics and special effects
while the world he inhabits is counterfeit theres nothing fake about truman himself
no cue cards
its not always shakespeare but its genuine
thats how he can support an entire channel
a window onto the human condition
i prefer to think of it as a mirror
not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth he gives us a glimpse of ourselves
but how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when truman sleeps
we find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort
havent you ever watched your child or your lover sleep
lets go to some of those viewers calls
the interviewer presses a blinking illuminated button on his desks high tech phone terminal
into speaker phone charlotte north carolina for christof
youre on caller
christof its a great honor to speak with you
truman has never been closer
the way he looked directly at us spoke to us for the first time
do you think hell ever work it out
i dont believe so
he tested his world as we all do at certain times and eventually it passed the test
you have to understand he is a man made for tv the world he occupies his only frame of reference
no for him to come even this close to the truth is a remarkable testament to his instincts
the interviewer presses another line on his terminal
sacramento california youre on tru talk
how much of a strain has the last few days placed on the actors
working on truman has always been a huge commitment for an actor not just in terms of separation from friends and family but since truman essentially drives the plot its
a never ending improvisation
recent events have raised the pressure but also the prestige
cutting off the call of course truman has always been very much in on casting
as with our own lives the only people he cant cast are his family
otherwise he has final approval able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend marlon or alternatively relegate a star to
a bit player
pressing another line istanbul turkey youre on with world renowned videographer christof
ive admired your work my whole life although i cant say ive seen it all
can you settle an argument for me
whats the longest time truman has been off camera
trace of pride in his entire life forty two minutes
a technical fault in accounts for most of that time
the remainder generally results from blindspots in the early days when truman would stray out of range of our cameras
the hague for christof
pressing another line amagansett long island youre on tru talk
how can you say truman lives a life like any other
sensing the thinly disguised resentinent in the callers voice i believe that to be so
i often feel the only difference between trumans life and our own is that his is being more thoroughly documented
we all play our allotted roles hes not a performer
hes a prisoner
the interviewer goes to cut off the call but christof holds him back
rising to the challenge he can leave at any time
if his was more than just a vague ambition if he were absolutely determined to discover the truth theres no way we could prevent him
i think what really distresses you caller is that ultimately he prefers the comfort of his cell as if trying to convince herself
giving herself away no youre wrong
hell prove you wrong
he can still do it
a thought occurring looking directly into camera do i know you caller
your voice sounds familiar
sylvia finger on the button of the phone where she has cut off the call stares at christof on her television screen
it is she who is the female caller
christof seems to stare back at her as the talk show continues
from television recording a human life from birth to death thats still the intention
you still believe truman has more to contribute
still reflecting on the last call more than ever
by unwittingly allowing us to witness his struggles hes constantly forcing us to evaluate our own lives
he gives us hope
lets take another call
pressing a line london england youre on tru talk
by definition truman has to be free of censorship but has the recent violence and profanity caused a problem for the sponsors
sylvia shuts out the conversation on the television focusing on the window that displays truman still buried in his book
she comes close to the screen catching his melancholy
she has a camera and a white envelope in her hand
with a look of resolve she takes her fountain pen and writes trumans name on the envelope in her familiar blue ink
row upon row of digital video cassettes occupy one entire cavernous room truman and a date on the spine of each cassette
suspended from the ceiling a monitor shows a live picture of truman sleeping on the sofa
sitting in front of a playback monitor chloe is transfixed by truman thirty four years earlier a fetus in his mothers womb
what are you looking for
chloe tries to conceal her startlement at christofs unexpected entrance
not taking her eyes from screen he was premature wasnt he
only by two weeks
curious even then
like he couldnt wait to get started
feeling out where the conversation is headed his eagerness to leave his mothers womb also meant he was the one selected
what was it like the first show
the ultimate live television
in competition with five other unwanted pregnancies the casting of a show determined by an air date he was the one who arrived on cue
is it true what you said
on the show tonight
about letting him go if he wanted it badly enough
would you really do that
christof stares at his assistant weighing her loyalty
it wont come to that
the suitably crestfallen truman stands in front of his boss errol sitting behind his ostentaciously large desk
lawrence lounges on the guest sofa enjoying trumans dressing down
truman approaches the bank window
the teller is the young woman whose child truman attacked in the street
she takes a step back at the sight of truman apprehensive the confrontation fresh in her memory
truman glances at the names on the checks in the young womans hand realizing how she was able to identify him in the street
he begins to apologize profusely
truman enters the garage carrying sylvias sweater
he breathes in the scent one last time and reluctantly replaces it in the trunk
with a sense of finality he lowers the lid and fastens the lock
truman emerges from the garage wheeling his lawnmower deliberately averting his eyes from the back of the house
staring out of the kitchen window a tall glass of iced tea in her hand meryl has been anticipating her husbands appearance
she wears a neckbrace we sense more as a reminder to truman than for any benefit she might derive
feeling meryls eyes burning into his back truman fires up the mower and heads directly towards the symbolically uncut section of grass
we focus on the errant blades of grass as they are severed by the mower
the lawn is now uniformly trimmed
from a mechanical platform above the expressway christof and chloe watch trumans final act of defiance laid to rest
in an office building high above manhattans financial district a robotic manneouin in a piece suit stands at an upper story window mechanically lifting a coffee cup to its mouth
in the street below something is different about the rush hour traffic
the pedestrians are all standing around no one walking
some are chatting with each other others primping
the cars vans and taxis are also idling
camera locations are being checked
a miniature camera inserted into the head of a streetlamp a camera technician waves his hand in front of an innocent looking fire hydrant the eye of a mddel on
a bus shelters cosmetic ad is wiped clean the head of a parking meter is replaced a buttonhole camera is placed on a businessmans double breasted jacket by a technician we see from the buttons pov a contact lens camera is carefully inserted into the eye of trumans colleague lawrence another technician we observe from the contacts pov
finally a surveillance camera on the outside of a bank building and a tourists camcorder are positioned
christof is seated at the control desk directing the morning session simeon assisting chloe at his shoulder a buzz of excitement in the room
i hope weve got fresh extras
consulting a clipboard the rotation was made this morning
staring at a monitor irritated i dont like the couple with the baby
theyd never be together
the couple with the stroller are promptly moved further along the street
whos doing wardrobe
i keep seeing the same wardrobe
truman spills out of the subway car with hundreds of other commuters
we hear christofs off camera voice as always unheard by truman
everybody back to one
and action background
at the command the pedestrians and vehicles begin inoving normally truman exits the subway suspecting nothing
he begins his trek to work accompanied by the cued rush hour traffic
i like the woman with the dog
lets keep it moving
i want that traffic kept together
everybody look like youve got places to go
christof covers his microphone to deliver an aside to simeon from whom he has temporarily assumed the role of director
i bet he doesnt stop at the newstand
as predicted truman walks by barely glancing at a newspapers banner headline nuclear power plant reopened
christof scans the shot options available to him on the video wall
the large on air monitor cuts to truman via the point of view of an approaching pedestrian
for an instant the unaware truman looks directly into the lens of the disguised camera
the monitor cuts to an overhead shot from a streetlamp
the camera continues to follow trumans progress
ready car cam one
go to one
truman enters his office building as a taxi cruises by
and cut to interior
truman is immediately picked up by a hidden camera inside the building where he exchanges a half hearted greeting with an ancient security guard
the camera widens the angle
and action vivien
aside proud of his casting looks just like trumans mother at that age
vivien an insurance adjuster approaches the elevator button at the same time as truman
however she reaches for it after truman has already turned his back
incensed damn she missed her mark
impatiently to simeon why do we bother with walk throughs if nobody pays attention
give me a two shot of truman and vivien
go to the master hold the elevators
mustering patience into microphone vivien press the elevator button again and make sure you catch his eye this time
a second time trumans brief encounter with vivien goes like clockwork
as instructed she hammers away at the elevator button and throws a conspiratorial look to truman
the elevator car duly arrives and trumans eyes follow viviens rear as she sachets into the lift
for a moment he appears to glance at a piece of gaffer tape on the marble floor
cut to the interior
the monitor cuts to the inside of the elevator rapidly filling with co workers
just as the doors are about to close lawrence oozes in
he gives truman a smug smile
nice look lawrence
the elevator doors open and vivien exits with two co workers
admiring aside to the remaining fellow males in the elevator i wouldnt kick her out of bed
truman doesnt seem to share lawrences enthusiasm for the comely young woman
he is miles away
assembled around a long oval table for a story confernce are several principal characters in trumans life meryl marlon errol tyrone raquel veronica and the new actress vivien sitting slightly
apart from the rest of the cast
christof takes his place at the head of the table a large monitor showing truman drinking coffee in his cubicle at american life plays silently behind christofs head
to the meeting referring to meryl by her real name regrettably i have to inform you that hannah has chosen not to renew her contract
all eyes turn to meryl
she looks at the floor
im sure we can all respect her reasons
meryl receives a sympathetic squeeze of the hand from her co star marlon now out of wardrobe wearing an armani suit
her separation from truman will be orchestrated over the summer
more up beat however im pleased to announce that televisions first on air conception will still take place
you witnessed the initial contact this morning
glancing to vivien once again using her real name you all know claudia from her work in theatre
thankfully truman doesnt
the rest of the cast nod politely in viviens direction
referring to the bound documents chloe passes to each cast member this is a copy of claudias back story
her characters name will be vivien
shes the new adjuster at the office
the cast idly flip through the documents prominently stamped on the cover not to be taken on set
we intend to entice truman into the affair as soon as possible
claudia will make her advance at the seminar trumans attending next week
details are in your schedules
im sure youll all make claudia welcome
injecting a note of levity more sophisticated than the character he plays question is will truman make her welcome
the cast snickers
immediately back to business i dont have to tell you how critical the next few weeks will be
this takes us into the next generation
when trumans child is born the network will be switching to a two channel format to chronicle both lives
what happens when truman and the baby are both on camera together
there will simply be duplicate coverage
mischievous lets just hope we dont have twins
uncharacteristically flippant when truman dies do we go back to the single channel
the cast turn in her direction
christof has a second occasion to question his assistants loyalty
the barman waitress and patron we have seen before observe truman on the television above the bar
the cameras track trumans progress walking along broadway
as he ducks into a sex shop the threesome at the bar exchange looks
inside the store truman appears apprehensive
whats he doing in there
meryls at her moms
maybe hes got an urge
on screen truman looks through some x rated video titles
referring to trumans overcoat whats with the coat
smirking at the irony maybe he doesnt wanna be recognized
truman bumps into a display of sex paraphenalia knocking an item to the floor
remarking on trumans clumsiness nervous
truman tries to right the display and hurriedly exits the store the cameras following his journey as always
exasperated oh god he never bought nothing
give him a break
its taken him thirty four years to get the nerve to go in there
we focus on a list left by meryl on the refrigerator several pages long
the kitchen itself is a bombsite
more than the cliche dishes in the sink dozens of cardboard boxes stacked haphazardly on the floor
the usually orderly bedroom is also a mess
blankets piled in a heap
several large half filled cardboard boxes cluttering the room
a chair in an odd position near the bed
clothes strewn everywhere
hardly an inch of floor space remains uncovered
truman is asleep in bed the damaged waterbed replaced with a standard mattress
although he is completely covered from head to toe in bedding the outline of his body is still clearly visible
close up on the on air monitor in the temple of a control room
it displays a wide shot of trumans darkened bedroom filmed through the green hue of the night vision cameras
assistant producer simeon and his video operators slouch in their swivel chairs paying scant attention to the screen
simeon gives his instructions in a lethargic metronomic manner
go to two
operator eating a doughnut presses one of the illuminated buttons on the panel and the camera angle changes to a close shot of trumans covered head
the camera stays on the blanketed head for a long moment
and back to the medium
another button is pressed and the angle changes
a trace of frustration is evident in the control room
recording a sleeping subject is unrewarding enough without also having to contend with trumans recently aquired camera shyness
aside to simeon could we have picked a bigger loser if we tried
shrugs that loser pays our salary
hes given up on himself again
makes life easier for us
he is what he is
at the far end of the great room one of the large double doors opens and christof enters as always accompanied by chloe carrying a leather bound folder
simeon and the operators subtely straighten in their chairs
christof pretends not to notice
he is staring intently at the on air monitor
when did he start sleeping like that
about the time meryl left
is that the best shot we can get
whats to see
christof watches truman a trace of concern in his eyes
referring to the debris in trumans bedroom what happened to the room
he started to reorganize
i was going to call you
but half way through he gave up and fell asleep
apparently satisfied christof turns to an operator
i want to check the set ups for tomorrows insurance convention
reading off the notes in chloes folder the operator punches up a batch of camera angles on smaller preview monitors
they show a generic looking marriott hotel devoid of actors
a banner in reception reads welcome american life accident
the operator looks to christof for approval and realizes his producers attention has wandered
christof is staring at the sleeping figure of truman on the on air monitor
give me a shot from his wedding band
pointing out the ring on trumans bedside table he took it off
a trace of concern why is he so still
hes too still
christof picks up a spare headset from the panel and puts it to his ear
isolate the audio in the cans and amplify
an operator pushes up an audio fader on the panel
christof and his colleagues listen to trumans steady breathing in their headphones
simeon and the operators nod reassured that nothing is amiss
christof is not so easily convinced
give me a preview
an ecu on his torso
a camera hidden in the rooms bedside lamp zooms in to trumans prone outline
while the breathing remains steady the body does not rise and fall
anxious barking a command to chloe phone him
chloe picks up a phone connected to the desk and dials
anticipating chloes question wrong number
the phone on the bedside table inches from trumans head begins to ring
truman doesnt flinch
sylvia walks up from the seashore where she has been taking a late night swim
hearing the telephone ringing she rushes to pick it up
however after lifting the receiver the phone continues to ring
the sound is coming from her television left on in the bureau
on the screen truman sleeps seemingly undisturbed by the call
sylvia drying herself watches with fascination
christof and the crew are now highly agitated
a trace of panic he didnt drink tonight
every question receives a shake of the assistants head in reply
chloe promptly cuts the connection and trumans phone ceases to ring
get marlon over there
under what pretext
letting his anxiety show any fucking pretext
christof turns his back on the monitors his mind racing
marlons car squeals to a halt outside trumans house
hurriedly dressed in jeans and coat over a bare chest he dashes barefoot to the front door
he tries the doorhandle pounds on the door and rings the doorbell simultaneously shouting trumans name all the while
frustrated marlon runs to the bedroom and thumps on the window
he can see the shape of truman lying on the bed but his shouts fail to rouse him
marlon picks up one of meryls carefully nurtured flower pots from beneath the bedroom window
shouting a warning im comin in tru
marlon hurls the flower pot through the window sending a shower of glass over trumans bed
still he doesnt move
marlon reaches his hand through the shards of glass clinging to the window frame and unlatches the window
marlon clanbers headfirst through the opened window and lands in an awkward heap on the floor beside trumans bed
he pushes away the clutter in the bedroom and finally stands at his co stars bedside
there is a hissing sound
marlon gingerly lifts the bedcover
beneath the bedding is a life size inflatable female doll
the doll has been punctured by the glass and is slowly deflating
lying beside the dolls chest is trumans portable tape recorder
marlon picks up the recorder and places it next to his ear
the cassette plays the sound of truman breathing
christof wide eyed stares at the image on the on air monitor of marlon and his bizarre companion
marlon is frozen staring into camera
quiet but firm cut transmission
simeon hesitates unsure if has heard correctly
he looks to christof for confirmation his finger poised over an emergency button
enraged i said cut
christof lunges forward and presses the button himself
sylvia watches agog as the scene in trumans bedroom on her television screen is replaced by the truman logo and the message technical fault
please stand by
christof has taken his place at the control panel
on the bank of monitors in front of the mixing desk the operators systematically search through the numerous set ups in trumans home and neighborhood
occasionally marlon or an extra appear in frame as they fan out and begin a man hunt
while the on air monitor continues to play its test card christof and simeon concentrate on another isolated monitor playing in fast rewind time code in the bottom right corner
it is a recording of the nights transmission
simeon stops on the last on camera appearance by truman
they watch truman on screen switch off his bedroom light and climb into bed fully clothed immediately pulling the covers over his head
as the light is switched off the recording camera automatically switches to night vision
simeon continues to play at normal speed now and then scrolling forward in fast forward mode
christof suddenly points to the screen
zoom into the chair
simeon types the appropriate command
on the blown up screen between a cardboard box and a chair leg it is barely possible to make out trumans hand as he crawls commando style from his bedroom
his inflatable replacement already positioned in the bed
referring to the debris he wasnt making a mess
he was engineering a blind spot
how does he know where the cameras are
i dont know
noting the time code on the monitor staring into the back of simeons head all i know is weve been filming a blow up doll for the last three hours
simeon feels the hostility
the systematic search of the monitors continues
they now reveal that dawn has broken on the set
hanging up the phone weve declared a curfew
only the extras required for the search are on the set
everyone else is at first positions
all prop cars accounted for
he has to be on foot
he has the worlds most recognizable face
he cant disappear
all heads turn to chloe as she enters the grand control room with a status report
the sponsors are threatening to pull the plug if we dont make a statement within the next hour
the media is in a feeding frenzy
the phone lines are jammed
every network has a pirated shot of harlon and the dummy
truman rolls in the dirt of a construction site tearing at his clothes and caking his face and hair with black inud
he struggles up a slope onto an adjacent roadway where a shopping cart awaits loaded with soiled plastic bags
looking every inch a derelict truman begins to wheel his shopping cart through the empty streets of brooklyn
truman wheels his shopping cart over a deserted brooklyn bridge
over his shoulder in the far distance we see a lone car approaching
as it nears we recognize a police car
truman takes a look under the bridge as if participating in the search
the car slowly draws alongside the police officer looking straight into trumans blackened face
any sign of him
deliberately gravelling his voice not yet
the police officer takes a second look at truman
after what seems like an eternity he motions his partner to drive on
to truman as the car pulls away take it easy
we pan down one concrete canyon after another
the usually bustling financial district is totally eerily deserted
suddenly we see a line of people fanned out across a street
then another and another
people of every description shoulder to shoulder marching down the otherwise empty streets the way a search is conducted at a crime scene
the lines include principals and extras linked arm in arm wardrobed for their usual roles as executives and secretaries store clerks telephonists maintenance and construction workers waiters and waitresses cooks
shoppers officers fire fighters and homeless people
on one occasion we glimpse trumans colleagues lawrence errol and vivien amongst the searchers
a building to building floor to floor office to office search is also being conducted each structure secured as they go the searchers paying special attention to potential blind spots
such as closets dumpsters man holes sewers car trunks trees and shrubbery
we focus on one of the waves of searchers
truman has linked arms in the middle of a row his disguise still holding up
a swarm of helicopters fills the sky
while his colleagues monitor the bank of screens christof has been joined by the two ever anxious studio executives moses and to christof who is still studying the faces in
a row of searchers rumors are circulating hes dead
pacing nervously the sponsors are threatening to rip up their contracts
unconcerned referring to the static stand by graphic now accompanied by soothing classical music why
were getting higher ratings for that graphic than any time in the series
the television behind the bar carries the still graphic
bar patrons animatedly discuss trumans fate over their drinks
some place bets with each other over the outcome
a crowd of passers by hover around a display of televisions in the window of an electronics store awaiting developments
the two old women we have seen before stare intently at the graphic on their televisions
the fan of extras reaches the harbor and automatically turns to make another sweep
referring to the empty streets when we flush him out how do we explain this
deadpan we tell him the truth
chloe looks askance at christof
joking darkly were making a movie
hopeful well get him on this next sweep
what have we missed
its just a matter of time
weve missed something
christof turns his back on the screens
over his shoulder we see a monitor displaying a view of the harbor
truman has broken away from the line of searchers on the pretext of taking a leak
he is standing on the edge of pier facing the harbor his back turned to those beginning their next sweep
suddenly truman ducks behind one of the green and white inflatable canopies that enclose the wall street racquet club
we see a close up of trumans terrified eyes in his blackened face staring down at the lapping water
it triggers a montage of flashbacks
as usual the images all appear to play on a television screen
truman on the cliff face at seven years old his second grade teacher sister olivia a close up of drowning statistics at his insurance company mesmerized by the water in
the ferry terminal seventeen year old sylvia jumping in the fountain his waterbed rocking and seven year old truman sitting on the upturned boat in long island sound crying into the darkness
truman comes back to reality
he steels himself shuts out the doubts and dives into the water
underwater we see truman panicking at the shock of the cold sea arms and legs flailing
suddenly he stops and sinks for a moment in the weight of his clothes
then slowly he rises to the surface and begins to swim
moored in the harbor is the scaled down replica of columbus flagship the santa maria
christof is spooling through significant scenes in the history of truman on a preview monitor
he pauses on the scene of sylvia and truman at the fountain in flushing meadow park in the shows seventeenth season
sylvia has her finger to trumans lips
christof presses play on the mixing desk
from monitor you remember when you were a little boy
christof fast forwards then presses play once again
trust that boy
christof jabs the pause button freezing the picture
he recites the words to himself
trust that boy
to simeon were not watching the sea
confused why would we
sweep the harbor
truman is at the wheel of the santa maria wind filling her sails
covering the face of the ships compass is sylvias composite picture
his is the only craft afloat in new york harbor
as the archaic vessel passes under the verrazano narrows bridget the bridge appears on fire in the glow of the sunlight
truman steers around norton point and sets a course for the open sea the horizon
christof and his colleagues concentrate on a live aerial shot on a preview monitor skimming over the calm featureless sea
suddenly in the distance there appears a single sail etched against the horizon
simeon punches a button and the image of the sailing ship is instantly transferred to the large on air monitor
sylvia dozing on the sofa suddenly blinks open her eyes as the classical music on the television is abruptly replaced by the sound of a helicoptes rotor blade
sylvia focuses on the screen her breath taken away by the sight of truman at the wheel of the santa maria
staring intently at the on air monitor what do we have on that boat
simeon scans a computer shot list
he types in a code
a camera from the main mast of trumans ship activates
truman unaware of the camera is concentrating on steering the vessel
truman is out of sight of land the sea choppier now rising and falling beneath his boat
he nears a large buoy bobbing clumsily in the strong swell
an official looking sign is attached danger
do not enter
we see an extreme close up of the nautical signpost where a disguised miniature camera tracks trumans progress
christof and the other production staff watch truman from the buoys pov as he sails by
truman hears a helicopter overhead
by now the ocean spray has washed most of the dirt from his face only a residue remains
the rags he wears including sylvias sweater under his open coat are soaked
her picture clings stubbornly to the compass
as he steers he occasionally refers to a how to sail book from his coat pocket
he tacks against the wind as he watches the military chopper circle his boat
alter course immediately
you are entering a restricted area
truman screams defiantly back to the chopper
two young men on a street corner watch transfixed the image of truman steering the santa maria on a portable watchman tv
i knew he wasnt dead
the helicopter pilot continues to circle
pilot over p
alter course or we fire on your vessel
truman screams again at the chopper and gestures wildly at the pilot
get the hell away
its my life
into microphone to pilot eerily composed fire a warning
a round of machine gun fire strafes the water across the bows of trumans boat several rounds striking the deck
in his eyes we see the ghosts return
with great effort he shakes the doubts from his head and retrieves a flare gun from the storage cabinet in the boats wheel house
chopper pilot over p
drop your sails
truman takes aim at the chopper and fires the flare gun
the distress flare hurtles towards the hovering helicopter narrowly missing
truman ejects the spent cartridge and reloads
shocked at the near miss jesus
is he out of his mind
composed into microphone to pilot pull back
before the chopper can take evasive action truman takes aim a second time and fires
the distress flare fishtails into the sky and to trumans surprise and delight finds its mark striking the rear rotor blade
truman lets out a whoop
the helicopter immediately begins to spiral downwards towards the sea
the chopper pilots bail out of the cockpit splashing down safely into the coean while the helicopter enters the waves in a spectacular belly flop sinking out of view in
seconds like a stone
watching the pilots bobbing around in the ocean in their inflatable life jackets thoughts of duty invade trumans head
he shuts out the thoughts and turns his back steering away from the drifting pilots
a look of resolve in his eyes we have never witnessed before
sylvia kneels on the floor in front of the television
as christofs cameras dwell on her likeness the composite picture still covering the ships compass she allows herself a brief moment of satisfaction but she does not dare to hope
christof chloe simeon and the others have been joined in the control room by marlon meryl kirk and audrey
how long will another chopper take
by the time we pick up the pilots too long
we have to stop him for his own good
turn him back with the elements
hesitant theres no rescue boat in the area
he wont know what to do
trying to appeal to christofs sense of reason for gods sake chris
the whole world is watching
we cant kill him in front of a live audience
he was born in front of a live audience
never taking his eyes from the screen reassuring dont worry hes not willing to risk his life for the truth
his doubts will turn him back
simeon reluctantly turns to a panel of controls on the desk marked wave wind and rain
after typing in a command he winds the controls towards their maximum settings
kill the lights
chloe searches christofs face trying to find the man in whom she has believed for so long
darkness suddenly descends as storm clouds roll towards trumans boat at an alarming speed
high winds buffet the boat
truman fights the wheel
hurricane force winds shake the masts and keel ripping the sails to shreds
the picture of sylvia is torn from the compass and lost to the sea
his how to sail book skids off the deck
truman takes a rope from beneath the wheel house and lashes himself to the wheel to secure himself on board
shouting above the storm im coming to find you sylvia
im making myself deaf
screaming up to the sky youre going to have to kill me
monstrous waves continually submerge the deck
truman continues to head into the teeth of the gale
in contrast to his panic stricken colleagues christof gives an outward appearance of calm
however a bead of sweat appearing at his temple betrays him
agitated its not working
he can sail that thing
how can he sail
hes in insurance
he hasnt set foot on a boat since he was seven
to christof on the behalf of the studio i demand you cease transmission
defiant to operators keep running
to moses i take full responsibility
to operator in front of radar style screen how close
tip him over
unable to contain herself any longer entreating him you cant
hes tied himself to the wheel
staring at truman on the monitor becoming affected by his display of courage he doesnt care
to christof lunging for the control panel you lied you hypocrite
the only way he can leave is dead
chloe lunges for the control panel but christof throws her to the floor
enraged do it
all eyes turn in christofs direction as he confirms chloes accusation
staring at the on air monitor numb its too late
truman appears to be losing his fight against the storm each successive breaker taking its toll on his body sapping his strength his bindings the only thing holding him upright
his head slumps the wheel goes loose in his grasp spinning out of control
his will draining away
as he is about to be overcome by the next wave he thrusts his arm into the handles of the spinning wheel
he cries out in pain at the blow to his forearm but succeeds in halting the wheel
he braces for one last wave
but the wave does not come
a strange phenomenon is occurring in the ocean
a distinct division has appeared in the ocean swell
between the large rolling waves lies a corridor of calmer water several hundred yards wide a curious escape lane
the wind and the rain are also subsiding the darkness lifting
truman steers his vessel down this sea lane
after some time several large dark shapes emerge on the horizon
as truman steers towards the nearest shape he discovers what is behind the peculiar wave formations
it is certainly not the moon
the dark shape is a huge iron roller only half of which is exposed above the surface of the sea
the ocean swell is being caused by the roller slowly turning mechanically driven on either end by massive steel arms pumping from the sea bed
in fact there are rollers spaced four hundred yards apart in both directions along the horizon as far as the eye can see the calm sea lanes formed by the
gaps between the rollers
trumans boat is dwarfed by the gigantic machines
the exposed half of each roller the height of a ten story building its length equivalent to several football fields
the massive arms perpetually churn
trumans face is thrown into shadow as the boat slips quietly past the giant rotating drum
the water beyond the rollers is dead calm
truman stares ahead desperately trying to focus his eyes
but if the sight of the wave machines was difficult to comprehend it pales in comparison with the next sight that greets him
his boat is drifting inexorably on a slow collision course with the sky
that infinitely receding horizon line recedes no more
the sea really does meet the sky
the join is only too apparent
looming above him out of the sea is a cyclorama of colossal dimensions
the sky is nothing but a painted backdrop
truman looks upward straining his eyes to see the top of the sky but it curves away at a steep angle beyond his sight
the bow of the boat comes to rest against the sky bumping gently into its latex surface
truman unties his bindings and stumbles across the deck to the side rail
clinging to the rail with one hand he tentatively reaches out towards the painted cyclorama
he touches the sky
he feels the surface puts both terrified hands against it
hie eyes well up with tears
he presses his distraught face into it
he screams at the top of his voice
a primal scream
a pained animal howl
christof and his production staff take in trumans reaction in silence
trumans cry echos around bars offices shops homes and streets wherever a television is to be found
no viewer speaks
they are stunned to silence many teary eyed
as the boat drifts alongside the seemingly never ending curve of the cyclorama trumans attention is drawn to an outline in the otherwise flawless backdrop
he clambers to the prow of the boat
there camoflaged in the painted skyscape just above the water line is a door
truman grabs hold of the recessed doorhandle and halts the drifting boat
he stands in front of the door and closes his eyes in a silent prayer
he opens the door in the sky and steps through
spontaneous cheers and shouts of joy erupt from viewers in their various locations bars homes and offices
strangers hug each other and dance in celebration
even the cynical video operator jumps out of his seat for the first time in the film and lets out a joyous whoop forgetting himself for a moment caught up
in the drama
self conscious he takes his seat again almost immediately
his colleagues are transfixed by the live on air monitor continuing to play its only available shot the open door in the sky truman out of view
truman finds himself on a small metal landing
a steel ladder rises above him to the height of sky the soundstage roof so high as to be barely visible
the rungs also continue downward the depth of the ocean bed to a studio floor far below
truman turns and looks back through the door he has just entered
unsecured the santa maria is beginning to drift away
the sea he has feared since childhood is nothing but an enormous tank
the sky a massive cyclorama
new york city an elaborate set
and it is all housed within an impossibly large soundstage
truman makes no effort to save the boat
he shuts the door to his world
a sign on the back of the door reads closed set
no unauthorized access
gradually he becomes aware of another strange phenomenon taking place in the soundstage
all around him thousands of light fixtures mounted in the cyclorama to masquerade as stars are slowly illuminating switched on by an automatic timer
the light fixtures match the one that almost struck trumans car at the beginning of the film
by artificial starlight truman begins his long descent of the step ladder
below a studio tram makes its way along the soundstage perimeter on the last tour of the day
as he drives a well scrubbed young tour guide delivers his tired commentary into a microphone for the thousandth time to the half full tram of studio visitors
the soundstage roof houses over eight hundred thousand lights of varying intensities to faithfully recreate the constellations
however the passengers are paying less attention than usual
they stare perplexed at the television monitor above the guides head continuing to play the shows only available shot of the open door in the sky
truman suddenly steps in front of the tram
the tour guide stands on the brakes tram lurching to a stop
the guide looks from trumans haunted face to the monitor hardly able to believe his eyes
truman leaps on board pressing his flare gun into the side of the guides head
to the shocked passengers nobody move
to the guide drive
the terrified guide pulls jerkily away in the tram resuming the tour
to the guide gesturing to the microphone keep talking
say whatever you say
the guide hesitantly resumes his commentary into his microphone
the ocean tank contains over six hundred and fifty million gallons of man made salt water temperature controlled
trumans attention drifts to the logo on the side of the tram truman studio tour
he is suddenly aware of the tourists gawking at him
to tourist camcorder around his neck act normal
truman ducks out of sight as a fleet of studio security cars speeds towards the tram
but they streak past on their way to the site of trumans escape
as he tentatively gets back to his feet truman finds a child standing in front of him with an autograph book
please mister truman
on the childs t shirt a large photograph of trumans face
christof talks anxiously on the phone unaware of a shift in the balance of power taking place behind his back
the executives moses and roman are huddling with simeon making him an offer he appears to welcome
into the phone what do you mean hes not there
we cant have lost him again
on the far side of the control room behind a huge curved glass wall on a mezzanine floor a studio tour tram passes by
truman crouches behind a seat on the tram flare gun still trained on the guides head taking in the gigantic video wall displaying pictures from every facet of his life
his heart sinks as he spies the monitor revealing the private spot where he and sylvia met
on your left the control room where the angles are selected and the actors receive direction
of course the one place we cant show you is the story department
there is none
hesitant truman writes the script
from trumans pov we watch chloe approach christof
she has a pure white envelope in her hands
as christof looks up to acknowledge her he almost makes eye contact with truman on the tram
still inside the studio complex the tram enters the courtyard of an indoor shopping mall
truman gift shops
truman is momentarily frozen by the sight of window displays full of books and board games carrying his likeness with titles such as trumantrivia
video cassettes offering truman highlights
his face emblazoned on t shirts caps coffee mugs and posters
even truman dolls and a model of his decaying oldsmobile are offered for sale
the tram slows to a stop behind other trams at the tours end
studio police are checking the disembarking passengers
truman using the tour guide as a shield also exits the tram
frightened for his life here he is
truman contemptuously backhands the guide across the face and makes a run for it
the guards give chase
truman runs into a lookalike mannequin dressed in a brown suit identical to his own promoting trumanwear
he pulls his double to the ground to block the guards path
sprinting along a featureless corridor he reaches a dead end
into radio weve got him trapped
truman enters a doorway marked no entry to find a stairway leading upwards
he takes the stairs three at a time
the footsteps and shouts of the guards not far behind
flight after flight of stairs
at one point he loses his grip on the stairs railing and his gun falls from his hand clattering for an eternity down the stairwell
he finally emerges on a landing
one more door
he tries the handle
truman finds himself on the roof of the soundstage
really outside for the first time in his life
he looks frantically around him
nowhere to hide
the soundstage stretches for miles in both directions as far as the eye can see an interminable expanse of roof
facing him a colossal burbank
several other soundstages almost as gigantic as his own
the palm trees lining the streets dwarfed by the mammoth barns
the hollywood freeway in the distance carrying its ribbons of traffic twenty lanes wide
gargantuan office buildings eclipse any skyscraper truman has ever known
directly below him a dizzying drop to the studio lot and its arched entranceway
above him a large yellow moon in the twilight sky
the real moon not the planetarium projection he has been contemplating for the last thirty four years
truman wheels around suddenly realizing he is not alone
a group has emerged on the rooftop standing still and silent in a semi circle cutting off any escape
along with the studio guards keeping their distance in the background are chloe simeon and the two studio executives moses and roman
in front of them the co stars in his life marlon meryl sister raquel mother audrey and supposedly dead father kirk
no one moves or speaks as truman scans the familiar faces
marlon in particular cannot look him in the eye
trumans gaze finally falls on the white haired old man standing at the head of the group
he approaches truman alone carrying a white envelope calling his name the way a father calls to a son
truman seems to sense the significance christof has had in his life drawn to and repelled by him at the same time
as they stand together looking into each others eyes for the first time they seem to be the only two figures on the roof
for a moment truman averts his gaze to the night sky
quietly half to himself half to christof even the stars i wished on
as truman turns his attention back to christof he suddenly lunges at him catching him off guard the envelope slipping from christofs hand
with a strength he never knew he possessed truman forces christof to the edge of the soundstage roof threatening to throw them both off his counterfeit world
christof clings desperately to truman to save himself
the studio guards dare not move
staring into the chasm remaining eerily calm you wont do it truman
ive watched you your whole life
meeting christofs gaze you never had a camera in my head
suddenly the doubts flood into christofs eyes fearing he has misjudged truman fearing for his life
incensed something was real
a terrifying anguish something had to be real
it takes all of trumans will not to hurl the old man into the abyss
christof petrified looks to the pristine white envelope that lies half over the edge of the roof glinting in the moonlight
truman follows christofs gaze
contemptuously tossing christof aside he retrieves the envelope
christof crawls to safety thankful to still be alive suddenly appearing very small and insignificant
but christof and the other figures on the rooftop no longer exist in trumans mind
truman gazes at his name for a long moment handwritten on the envelope in blue ink then carefully breaks the seal
truman allows the sole item in the envelope to be slowly revealed
a close up of sylvias face including her eyes mouth and that perfect ever elusive nose
a serenity comes over truman
he lifts up his eyes to the mountains on the far horizon
as he stands on the very edge of the soundstage roof without fear clutching the photograph we commence a long slow pull back
truman is unaware that directly beneath his feet on the wall of the enormous soundstage is a billboard acrrying a gigantic picture of his face and proclaiming truman total record
of a human life
th great year
we continue to pull back until truman is nothing but a speck on top of the soundstage so large it never completely clears frame
the two old women in the living room the nightwatchmen the two young men with the watchman tv the patrons in the bar passers by outside an electronics store are
all captivated by their television sets
we focus on the screen of a television
a small female baby sucks a toy on a blanket in the backyard of trumans old suburban home in queens the lawn he mowed for ten years of his life
the infants doting parents marlon and the new actress vivien enter frame and begin to fuss over the child
a border around the action on the screen announces zoe total record of a human life
suddenly we see a childs hand on top of the television screen
a baby stands unsteadily supporting herself against the television set in sylvias house
truman bends down and picks up his baby tossing her into the air much to the childs delight
truman dwells for a moment on the mirror image scene on the television before very deliberately shutting it off
sylvia joins truman and their daughter
together they exit the beach house
we follow them as they make their way onto the deserted sand and down towards the sea
