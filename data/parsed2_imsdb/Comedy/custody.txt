written by eric stuyvesant rick stevens thirty six is middle america personified
he blends in at the crowded ballpark
blue jeans work boots a ball cap and leather jacket complete his attire
he snacks on a bag of popcorn
the crack of the bat and the crowd is on their feet
a ball player slides safely into second with a double
john silverstein thirty three business clad talks on his cell phone
calm and collected he appears unaffected by the cheering crowd
the sits with the crowd
helluva talent that kid
john flashes a quick grin never missing a beat in his phone call
probably be in the bigs in another year
john nods smiles and turns away from rick to continue uninterrupted
melanie simmers twenty four scurries around a sparse but neatly adorned house getting dressed
are you ready
mommy cant be late again
zach simmers six sits on his bed in pajamas
come on baby
dont do this to mommy
i dont want to go
melanie hastily dresses her son
zach do you want mommy to get fired
if i get fired we wont have the money to go to six flags
zach quickly dresses himself
john still talks on his cell
must be something to have that kind of talent
hes just a kid nineteen twenty tops and if he stays healthy and he stays focused the world is his oyster
guys like you and me we squandered those opportunities long ago
john ends his call and turns back to rick
guys like you
i on the other hand knew where i was going
i had that kind of drive i just never had the talent
you knew where you were going
the only thing i knew for certain was that i would run to the corner store every day for beer
melanie pulls into a parking space and turns the car off
lock your door
ill be right back
melanie opens her door
melanie pops her head back in the car
im not thirteen
its against the law to leave me alone in a car until im thirteen
johns phone rings
he ignores the call
i had priorities
i understood what it meant to have an attention span
you could focus
i was the king of focus
the duke of diligence
the count of concentration
rick is still looking at john when he hears the crack of the bat
john appears perplexed
johns pov a foul ball is screaming in his direction
too late the ball strikes john in the face knocking him out of his seat
rick recovers and continues to snack on his popcorn
the polestar prince
melanie carries a soda and a bag of chips
zach stands at the cooler looking through the glass
did you decide
i want coke
a beat no seven up
maybe root beer
make up your mind already
so many choices
a glance to her watch
the game is over
rick and john stand at the front gate
the exiting crowd flows around them
john holds an ice pack to the side of his face
im just saying grow up
you cant keep drifting
i thought i did grow up
when you got married
you matured a little
its a process
no bueller its a decision
one you need to make
you cant keep running without direction
if you dont know where youre going youll never get what you want
melanie and zach stand at the counter
the clerk rings them out
zach grabs the bottle from the counter
i want sobe
melanie snatches the bottle back
an impatient line of customers waits
i dont want coke
i want sobe
melanie puts the bottle back on the counter
well take the soda
zach stomps his feet
two dollars and
hold on a minute
come on lady
a beat as zach and melanie exchange glares
get your sobe
the crowd has waned
i thought i got direction
when cindy had kids
they gave you purpose
but purpose my friend is not direction
my direction is east
i parked in the deck
im right around the
were always going in different directions
mine are much more productive
and much less adventurous
well im gonna
thats what im going to do
john turns and heads south
rick takes a bite of popcorn looks to the sky for a moment grins and heads off northeast
zach takes a long swig of sobe
i want coke
john jogs up behind rick
you want to
get a beer
gotta get home
family my man
take time off for a ballgame ya should probably tend to the family too
you should try it sometime
in the grand scheme of things family is a liability not an asset
rick continues on
do you even know what youre doing or where youre going
yelling over his shoulder
east leads nowhere my friend
you should be heading south
the bar is south
east takes you places you dont want to go
rick reaches the corner and darts across the street
melanie stands in front of her boss s
i know but
its the third time this week mel
you put me in a rough spot here
my boss wants me to let you go
his boss wants me to let you go
i gotta let you go
if a person isnt responsible enough to be prompt to their job theyre not responsible enough to work for me
youre fired mel
just get your things and go
a beat as melanie turns to leave
we still on for dinner
two officers parked on main watch rick cross the street
officers pov a wanted poster of rick stevens
cant tell from here
too far away
lets roost him
call it in
rick walks east on buchtel as police cruiser creeps behind
officers pov slowly driving past the officers recognize rick
get him get him get him
they curb the car in front of rick
rick appears dumbfounded as the officers exit the cruiser with guns drawn
officer one remains stationary
officer two circles behind rick
get em up
up i said
get em where we can see em slimeball
rick raises his hands dropping his popcorn
oh we got ourselves a litterbug here
placing his pistol back in his holster officer two grabs rick by the collar and throws him against the cruiser
officer one remains drawn on rick
his hands shake with nervous anticipation
officer two cuffs rick
leaning in he speaks in ricks ear
you know your rights cretin but just in case you dont
what the hell
officer two spins rick to face him
you have the right to shut the hell up
do you understand this right
officer one appears very eager to discharge his weapon
shut him the hell up jimmy
if you dont shut the hell up my partner might exercise his right to shoot you
do you understand
yes begins to form on ricks lips
a quick glance at officer one and he decides to nod
hes looking at me funny jimmy
you have the right not to look at my partner in any way that might be construed as funny which could result in harm to your person
do you understand this right
rick nods again
i dont think he is
are you twitching boy
look at him hes twitching
nothing pisses me off more than twitching and talking
if he doesnt stop im gonna waste him
you have the right not to twitch or shiver or make any other odd movements that might encourage my partner to discharge his weapon do you understand
melanie grabs her stuff
you never answered about tonight
youre making a huge mistake
an unmarked car pulls on scene
the door opens
low in on walking feet and pan up to reveal detective johnson s a gruff man in tweed
what do we got here boys
we got him
hes a twitcher
a twitcher and a talker
boy i tell you if hed twitched one more time i wouldve deposited large amounts of hot lead in his ass
ill take it from here boys
no thats your job
if we have to write the report i say i get to shoot him
no ones getting shot today bobby
cant i just wing him or something
jimmy get him out of here
officer two moves to his unwilling partner and helps him place his weapon in his holster
officer ones hand is still clenched to his gun as officer two drags him around the car and forces him into the cruiser
tell me im not responsible
i have a kid
he has a goldfish
i have my dignity
mel anie contd he has a brown ring on his collar
hes nothing more than a turd with feet
rick is restless in the back seat
johnson glances in the rear view mirror
you dont want to piss bobby off
hes a little unstable
he represents your force
we have to hire our fair share of disabled quota thing
his psychosis doesnt appear disabling
nelson s prepares a snack
i dont want to talk about it
the first thing i learned when i retired was that time management is an asset
five diverse men including rick stand against the wall
on the other side of the mirror detective johnson sits with the lady in black s
a black veil streams from her hat covering her eyes circa s
take your time maam
we need you to be certain
can i see their profiles
detective johnson keys a microphone
turn to your left
the men follow their instruction
i just dont know
back to front
three men turn to face forward
the other two turn to face the wall
all of you face forward
the two turn forward
are you sure
could you have him step forward
the detective keys his microphone again
number three take two steps forward
rick steps forward and the lights dim on the other four
caught in the spotlight rick squints from the brightness
the lady in black shifts in her seat
a long beat
thats the man that needs to be in custody
the detective keys his microphone once again
okay number three step back
rick does as hes told
turn to your right all of you
the group follows the detectives instruction
one by one the men filter through the door
rick enters on stage
the entire theater is cast in shades of gray
the stage is barren
there is no audience
he looks around for a moment and as he reaches center stage is once again flooded with the spotlight
rick uses his arm to shade his eyes
sfx a soft din of voices
looking stage left rick realizes twelve jurors have appeared in their box
a small audience has congregated
sfx the din swells to a quiet chaos
a rapping of a gavel and ricks attention swings to a white haired judge s
order in the court
the noise level wanes but not completely
another rap of the gavel
order in the court i say
focused on the judge rick doesnt notice the prosecutor approaching from stage right
carrying a folding chair in one hand notes and manila folders in the other he sets the chair behind rick
have a seat
do you know why youre here today mr
why am i here
are you being rhetorical
are you asking me
you stand here today an accused man
accused of what
you have been placed in custody of your children
your children mr
you do realize you have children dont you
but nothing mr
stevens either you have children or you dont
so you accept responsibility for bringing young life into the world
theres no guessing mr
stevens either youre responsible for siring offspring or you arent
i am but im not sure it was responsible
a crime of passion mr
a beat and you accept the consequences of said actions
why am i here
why are you here mr
why are you here
ill tell you why youre here
are you familiar with ms
yeah shes my wife
was your wife sir
was your wife
she recently filed for divorce
were you aware of that
no no i wasnt
well she did
she also named you as her coconspirator in the act of having children
were you aware of that mr
stevens you just told the court that you aware you had children
you have also admitted that ms
cynthia stevens was in fact your wife
pro secut or contd on top of that you told this court that you accepted the responsibility of having said children did you not
then why mr
stevens do you continue to deny culpability in this situation
rick realizes the audience has swelled to nearly a full house
beads of sweat form on his brow
answer the question
answer the question
like a trapped animal rick looks for his escape
the question mr
how can you be sure it was me
the audience hisses
the judge raps his gavel
she picked you out of a lineup sir
what more do you need
time is not an option mr
time is not an option
a look of sad resignation crosses ricks face
you dont deny being married to ms
stevens nor do you deny the act of procreation
you seem to understand that your actions bear consequence
you seem to understand that with parenthood came responsibility
pro secut or contd it seems to me as it should to anyone with the capacity for simple deduction that you mr
stevens did willingly and knowingly enter into the commitments of parenthood fully aware of the potential pratfalls
did you not
yes yes i did
its time to pay the piper mr
to the judge it is the recommendation of the state that richard c
stevens been sentenced to the fullest capacity allowed by law
what about cindy
my ex cindy what about her responsibilities to the children
the prosecutor moves to rick and whispers in his ear
she cut a deal rick
you were the one we wanted
you were the one we got
she took the plea
sure it costs her financially
but what is freedom worth
a clamor begins to rise from the crowd as they talk among themselves
the rap of the gavel
i see no reason to extend this any further
stevens you have been found competent by the state and by this court
you are completely cognizant of your surroundings and you leave me no choice
this court finds you guilty as charged
guilty of what
you are hereby remanded to custody of your children for no less than a lifetime
this court is adjourned
a gasp in the audience mixed with cheers
rick appears dumbfounded
a bailiff approaches rick and begins to lead him off stage
rick scuffles and struggles
the judge stands and begins to collect his files
i cant do this alone
dont make me do this alone
ill never make it
if you cant do the time mr
stevens then dont do the crime
nelson enters the kitchen carrying a book
she hands the book to melanie
highly effective strategies of time management for the single parent
it was written by a man
a married man
lots of single parents are married
rick sits alone his head hung low
a jailer s approaches leading three young children to the cell
kris is followed by phillip and nicholas
the door swings open
the children run to their father
i love you daddy
i love you too phillip
i love you more
i love you more
i love you more
daddy how come youre in jail
is this where we live
when can we see mommy
come here guys
i want to talk to you
the boys gather round
whats wrong daddy
i dont know when were going to see your mom again
is she okay
shes kind of mad at daddy
mommy mad at me too
no baby not at all
your mom needs time to work through some things
so for awhile its just going to be us
whats she need time for
to figure out who she is where shes going what she wants
i miss mommy
she misses you too baby
and this isnt permanent
were going to fight this
were going to appeal
well take it to the supreme court if we have to
you dont want us either
of course i want you
i just dont think i should have to do this alone
the jailer still lingers in the doorway leaning against the bars
i feel for you i really do but ive seen your kind before
youre a lifer
whether its fair or not
whether justice was served
it doesnt matter
youre here for the duration
the boys cling to their father
the clank of the door being closed
the jailer whistles a sad spiritual as he walks away
melanie sits on her couch and cries
whats wrong mommy
why are you crying
did i do something wrong
nothing at all baby
pulling a book from an end table tell me a story
the camera pulls back to reveal that the room is really a well furnished cell
once upon a time a very long time ago
kids and toys are strewn across the floor
rick wears a heavy shade of facial growth
he reads the genealogy of morals
the jailer stands at the cell door
get yourself cleaned up
you have visitors
in the courtyard
shaved and wearing sunglasses rick approaches his parents
he reaches his father s first
quite the pickle youve got yourself in
so it seems
ricks mother gives him a big hug
she was no good for you
i knew it from the start
i know but whats done is done
the children notice their grandparents and run to greet them
they tackle their grandfathers legs
theres my boys
rick and his mother sit at a picnic table while the boys play with their grandfather
youre dad and i are here for you
i know mom
are you eating
yeah i guess
do you need anything
watch the kids one night
i could use some time to myself
i suppose that would be all right
wed have to ask your father but i dont see why that would be a problem
a beat other than that everythings okay
because it doesnt have to be like this
mary ryan a friend of mine her son had the same thing happen to him
wife just up and left with no warning at all
he didnt waste a day
no sir he was up and at em almost instantly
you can leave here you know
mary ryans son did
i like it here mom
whats to like
its dingy and filthy
its no place to raise children
its home and its stable
the one thing the boys need right now is stability
you cant keep hiding forever
its been five days mom
im not hiding
i just need time to adjust
mary ryans son thinks youre hiding
do i know this guy
ricks mother slides a business card across the picnic table
no but i think you should
i hate that woman
how can a mother abandon her kids
how could she do this to my babies
rick looks to a blue sky
on a wad of blue cotton candy
pull back to reveal cindy and her new beau scott s and leather clad
cindy walks focused on her cotton candy
she doesnt realize that scott has stopped to watch a hottie walk past
the two exchange a flirtatious glance
catching up yeah baby
i hope shes living in hell too
melanie looks through the want ads
some jobs are already circled
what ya doing
looking for a job
i know what you could do
you could stay home with me
what do you pay
zach reaches deep in his pocket and pulls out a few coins
he counts them
sixty five cents
you can afford that
if it keeps my mommy home with me
rick sits across the desk from frank ryan an uncouth italian man who seems content to stuff his face with a submarine sandwich and speak through his mastication
so needless to say i understand your situation
my old lady she took off and left me with the kids five years ago
but im not bitter or anything
i found me a good day care and moved on with my life
you should too
of course its hard sometimes feels like youre in prison but you gotta be a man
stand up for yourself
provide for your family
and you can help
ill put ya to work
some long hours but it all pays off
keeps you off the welfare system if ya know what i mean
id rather pay you than pay the government to pay you
you can start monday
rick stands to leave
heres the number to the day care
tell them you know me theyll cut you a break
the clock reads when rick pulls into the day care parking lot
rick and the boys follow ms
heath on the guided tour
and when school starts we have a bus service that will take the two oldest to and from school
we have story hour at eleven lunch at noon and nap time at twelve thirty
rest assured our programs are designed to be nurturing caring environments that provide the parental guidance your children need in those hours you cant be with them
so are there any questions
no you seemed to cover everything
heath bends down to the kids level
youre going to like it here
the kids grab ricks leg
no daddy dont leave us here
heath looks up to rick
reassuringly theyll be just fine
rick pushes a broom as the clock unwinds
melanie sits in front of her first interviewer
it would be really nice to have you on board but youre just a little too qualified
the children are into everything
there appears to be absolutely no rules
rick eats his lunch
the children are engaged in a food fight
melanie sits in front of her second interviewer
rick fumbles with his keys as he unlocks his car door
melanie sits in front of the third interviewer
the children run around in their underwear nicholas in diapers as the provider launders their clothes
melanie sits in front of the fourth interviewer
youre just not qualified
the clock reads as rick shuts off his car and opens the door
melanie sits in front of the fifth interviewer
i dont think ive seen such a perfect candidate
the provider is hurriedly scrubbing the childrens faces and hands
tracking beside rick reaches the door and opens it
melanie leans forward in her seat
the children are crying
you are bad bad children
rick approaches the room
stedicam on ricks face cu
on fifth interviewer
you really fit the billet
as rick enters the children run to him
so did everything go okay
they were angels
did you have fun boys
the boys look to the provider who has a nasty scowl on her face
we love it
rick loads the kids into the car
the boys giggle as they rough house in the back seat
get those seat belts on
the kids reluctantly comply
so how was your day
didnt they feed you
they said they would feed you
the brochure said meals provided
we didnt eat nuffin
daddy im hungry
she appears relieved
unfortunately we filled the position earlier today
whip pan to cell doors slamming closed
rick pulls through the drive thru takes his order from a smiling employee and doles out the grub the as he drives off
the kids arent interested in eating
french fries are flying everywhere
rick stands in a doorway
frank fingers through a file cabinet
so how was your first week
thirteen hours a day doesnt leave me much time for my kids but a jobs a job right
now youre talking
frank finds ricks check and smiles as he hands him his laurels
two hundred and fifty bucks
pretty good huh
two hundred and fifty bucks
dont spend it all in one place
i give you sixty five hours of my time and you give me two hundred fifty bucks
its the american way
this country was founded on low paying back breaking long hour jobs
why work like this makes you a bona fide patriot
ya gotta love it
mumbling as he exits whats not to love
ready to leave the boys goof in the hallway
in the office rick waits patiently as ms
heath tallies up the weekly totals
that will be two hundred seventy five dollars and thirty six cents
im a little short
rick takes the money from his pocket and hands it to ms
we take checks too
those things you use when you dont have money
im sorry im clueless
my wife handled the checks
does it help that i know frank ryan
he told me to mention his name
you know frank
i work for him
heath looks back to her books
that changes everything
two hundred ninety five dollars and thirty six cents
frank owes me money and one way or another i will collect
so im forty five dollars short
and thirty six cents
dont worry about it
its your first week
you didnt know so well let it ride and just add it to next weeks balance
a beat as rick turns to leave
you know there is a way you could save quite a bit of money
potty train the toddler
heath pulls some literature from her desk drawer
handing rick the pamphlet the toddler
melanie sits at a computer
when are we going to have a normal life
we do have a normal life
i mean when are we going to be like other people
she pulls a flyer from the printer
on flyer baby rick and nicholas sit on the cot
rick reads to himself
nicholas looks at the pictures
big boy go potty
are you a big boy
huge mong gus
rick and the boys are in the baby isle
rick picks up a pack of pull ups studies it for a moment and throws it in the cart
on a community bulletin board he sees a flyer for baby sitting
he pulls the flyer folds it and stuffs it in his pocket
rick sets nicholas on the potty
big boys go potty on the potty nicholas
nicholas go potty on the potty
nicky shakes his head no

nicky shakes his head again no again

rick and the boys are in the toy isle
nicholas has a huge grin on his face and a big toy in his hand
rick takes the toy and tosses it in the cart
nicky stands in front of his father

heaths office again
hows the potty training coming

i run a reputable business and i need the balance by next wednesday or maybe you should consider other arrangements
phillip runs into the office crying
blood streams down his head
kris follows close behind
i didnt do it
rick kris and nicky sit patiently
ricks mother and father burst through the doors
where is he
is he going to be okay
hes going to be fine
theyre working on him now
from what they told me its just a few stitches
boys will be boys
a nurse peeks out
stevens can you come back
the doctor could use your help in calming the child down
ill watch these two
phillip is in a halo
the doctor appears perplexed as he stands near the child
how can i help
well i need to give him a local so that i can sew the laceration but hes not cooperating
maybe hold his hand and distract him
rick moves to phillip
hi little buddy
i need you to be a good boy okay
so did you have fun today
did you play with all your friends
the doc injects the child
that fuckin hurts
but daddy it does
thats a big people word
youre a little people and little people dont use big people words
to doctor im sorry
the doctor offers a smug smile and begins to sew the cut
do that again and my daddys going to kick your ass
phillip runs down the hall with a huge butterfly bandage on his head
he stops to chat with all the nurses
rick walks a few steps behind carrying his coat
the doctor hurries to catch up with rick
look im really sorry
can i ask you something
rick shifts uncomfortably
sure i guess
my sons a wuss
he cries over hangnails
my wife and i have tried everything to toughen him up but nothing works
i was wondering if our kids could play together
maybe some of phillips boy would rub off on junior
rick stands at the counter
the boys rough house with their grandparents in the background
that thing that covers medical emergencies
i dont think i have any
everybody has insurance
i dont think i do
the receptionist slides a bill across the desk
from ricks pov the bill he holds shows a balance due of
can i run a tab
you dont have a check
rick walks with his mother
the boys and their grandfather are a few steps ahead
im not even responsible for myself
how am i suppose to raise three kids
it can be done
i dont see how
find a way
everything happens for a reason
god doesnt abandon his children and neither will you
god doesnt pay day care
there are other things out there
less expensive ways
could you watch them
i dont think your father is willing to do that
we raised our kids rick
how bout tonight so i can catch a breath
my watching them while you were in there with phillip wasnt enough
make me feel guilty
ill just ask god to watch them
he never abandons his children
ricks mom reaches in her purse and pulls some bills from her wallet
i dont want your money mom
take the money
as rick puts the money in his pocket he finds the flyer
nicky sits on the potty
i cant do it daddy
you can do it
i cant do it
would you do it for a nickel
i cant do it
rick lifts the child from the toilet
rick stands in front of the toilet and relieves himself
nicholas watches by his side
he finishes and zips himself up
daddy go potty in the potty
ricks pov a puddle on the floor
a rap on the cell door
rick turns around to find melanie looking in
the baby sitter
oh right im glad you could
my daddy has a big pee pee
i was just demonstrating the art of
melanie enters the cell followed by zach
you have a kid
so do you
not criticizing just surprised
i dont believe anyone at their old day care had kids
if they did they kept them in a closet and only brought them out on special occasions
christmas easter an occasional birthday and maybe when they had friends over for dinner but only as a status symbol
it was like theyd say heres the white picket fence
heres the suv
heres the dog
oh yes heres the
kids you can get back in the closet now
youd could make a fortune with a renta kid business
that has potential
ive often thought of renting mine
why pay for a baby sitter when thousands of people would pay good money to set your kid on the mantle for a few hours
so whats his name
rick drops to a knee and extends his hand
you got me there
i am old
older than dirt
when i was a kid we didnt have dirt
we had rocks and we had hammers
if we wanted dirt we banged a few rocks with really big hammers and then we had dirt
worked the chain gangs
youre too old for my mom
kris and phillip who have been sitting in the corner realize they have visitors and spring to greet them
this is kristian
this is phillip and the little guy from the potty is nicholas
guys this is zach and
the four boys run os to play
ever try cheerios
for potty training
give him something to aim at
drop a cheerio or two in the toilet and let him pee away
ill have to try that
so any questions about the job
melanie moves towards the boys
im going to go talk to them for a little bit
ill let you know
melanie crouches to the boys level
they appear to take a real shine to her
nicholas hands her a book and the four of them move to the cell cot
the boys gather round
my mom tells great stories
we dont have a mom
thats okay i dont have a dad
once upon a time
the cot morphs into a sofa
the dingy cell morphs into a well lit room
rick watches from a doorway
read it again
read it again
read it again
im gonna talk to your dad
well read another one in a little bit
you have a real knack there
not a knack really
its just about finding hope in places there should be none
whatever it is ive never seen them take to a woman like that
you want the job
id like that
rick is pushing his broom when a gorgeous blond woman walks past
they exchange long flirtatious looks
melanie is fixing the boys sandwiches
rick and the woman sit eating lunch
youre really funny
and kinda cute
maybe we should
go out sometime
id like that
i dont know
melanie on the phone
the boys run to her as she hangs up
who was that
that was your daddy
i love daddy
is he coming home
no hes going to be late
he has a date
they all snicker
so i guess you have to deal with me a little while longer
melanie chases them in circles
they fall in a pile and wrestle
rick picks at his food
the woman has barely touched her plate
youre a single father
so many men refuse to accept any responsibility for their kids
so how many do you have
im sure theyre just angels
the boys jump on a bed
rick appears completely devoid of the conversation
my sister has three
she said when the second one was born it doubled the work
she didnt realize the third would double the work load would again
and to think you do it all by yourself
youre a terrific man
did i tell you i love kids
they love me
it just comes so instinctively even though ive never had kids myself
i get lots of practice with my nephews though
so when can i meet your boys
kris stands with arms crossed and scowling
his posse of brothers does the same
kris pov looking up at the woman crouching down to him and smiling
youre not my mom
rick motions for the check
rick flees on foot
the woman gives chase
melanie tucks the boys into bed
rick sits with woman
a guy like you is so hard to find
i think i love you and i think you need to love me too
rick jumps into his car locking the doors behind him
woman tugs at the door handle as he drives away
melanie pours two glasses of wine
rick and woman are engaged in a deep kiss
they fumble through the door
melanie lights a candle on a table set for two
rick and woman tear off each others clothes
melanie finishes eating alone and blows out the candle
woman rests her head on ricks shoulder
that was incredible
i know i havent known you very long but i theres something i need to say
the woman wrapped in sheets runs down the street
rick gets to the door and catches himself in the jamb
calling out was it something i said
melanie washes the dishes
rick drives home in silence
melanies asleep on the sofa
rick kneels beside her
he lightly runs his fingers through her hair stirring her slumber
did you have a good time
yeah it was good
pretty much sucked
why cant i find a woman like you
youre trying too hard
i feel bad for the boys
they dont have a mom
shell always be their mother but shell never be their mom
quit trying so hard
youre forcing issues that cant be forced
everything happens when and how its suppose to
its about spirit and finding the will to love again for you and the boys
melanie sits up and puts on her shoes
you want to stay and
im going to get
a beat as they study each others eyes
daddy i have to potty
ill see you tomorrow
rick turns to tend to nicky
he stops for a moment then heads to the kitchen for a handful of cheerios
rick is on his hands and knees wiping the floor around the toilet
nicky almost dod it
almost baby boy
rick walks against the flow of the crowd
as if in a dream everywhere he looks he sees melanie
every woman has her face
the lights strobe in rhythm to the music
rick sits with john and his wife carrie silverstein
finally had to grow up
youve got direction
i dont know if youd call it direction but theres a definite sense of purpose
good for you
yeah but is it good for the kids
do the kids have direction
kris is in pushup position
rick is dressed as a gunnery sargent
only two kinds of people make it in this world boy those that are smart and those that are strong
if you dont want to be smart and do your homework then you can be strong and do pushups
rick stirs to reality
im probably not as demanding of them as i should be
you have to instill a sense of direction at a very early age
the entire family sits eating dinner
ricks mother looks to phillip
so phillip what do you want to be when you grow up
phillip studies rick for a moment
rick nods an approval
daddy says i can do three things when i grow up
and what are those
phillip takes a deep breath
i can go to college and move the hell out of his house
i can join the military and move the hell out of his house or i can get a job and
move the hell out of my house
rick shakes his head
ya gotta let them be what theyre going to be
no you have to mold them early
if you dont mold them theyll grow up to be democrats
and you do this with your kids
thats not the point is it carrie
i think rick is doing a wonderful job
its a struggle going at it alone but
excuse me gentleman i need to powder my nose
carrie walks off
i cant believe you
whining about being single
married men would kill to be in your situation
im just saying its hard
you have your sons to raise without feminine interference
do you understand the significance of your situation
do you understand the power in your circumstance
rick and the boys play baseball with an empty wrapping paper roll and a dirty sock
rick takes a swig of his beer
men all over the world would kill for that kind of power
rick and the boys head out the door with fishing poles in tow
john isnt letting this soapbox go
you have the kids and she pays child support
and you sit here and whine about things being hard
give me a break
it does have its advantages i suppose
rick and the boys sit in front of the tv watching football
rick has a beer in his hand
the boys drink root beer from beer mugs
john realizes the beer bottles are empty
john heads to the bar
carrie approaches the table
he went to grab a couple beers
you know rick someday some girl is going to realize what a good man you are
carrie i dont even have the funds to buy my own beer
love isnt about money
love is about truth and selflessness and discovering who you are and wholl be
someday someone will find you
melanie talks on the phone
rick pulls her from her seat
ill call you back
melanie fumbles the phone
a beat as they look into each others eyes
rick pulls her in for a kiss
what was that for
for finding me
rick and melanie sleep in each others arms
nicholas stands at the bed
have to potty daddy
go potty buddy
nicholas holds the box of cheerios
rick sits straight up to the sound of nickys cry and an empty box of cheerios on the floor and nicky ankle deep in water
frank sits at his desk
i thank you for everything but its time to move on
where are you going
what will you do
i dont know frank but im worth more than this
rick places his paycheck on franks desk and exits into the hall
the corridors echo as rick walks away
youll never make it without me
rick is strutting his way into a new job
hes dressed well
rick sits at his new desk arranging a few personal
he leans far back in his chair and clasps his hands behind his head
melanie rick and the boys fly a kite on a summers day
melanie rick and the boys are eating pizza
tears stream down phillips face
phillip whats wrong
well i wanted that piece and kris took that piece and i really really wanted that piece
whats so important about that piece
zach grabs the pizza and stuffs it in his mouth
phillip wails louder
kris reaches for a pitcher of soda
a tussle ensues
easy on the drinks guys
arriving home rick grabs an envelope that is taped to the door
kris bolts through the door and heads to the bathroom
phillip is crying again
whats wrong phillip
rick opens the envelope and pulls out a note
i gotta pee and kris
were not going to fight over the bathroom
ric k contd kris your brother has to go too
kris mopes back into the room
phillip sticks his tongue out at kris
the boys exit
rick looks up from his reading
rick balls the note and sticks it in his coat pocket
phillip and kris stand side by side over the toilet
a beat as phillip looks at his brother
this time mines bigger
kris begins to cry
stedicam on face as rick enters
ricks pov cindy sits at a table in the back
on rick as he approaches the table
im really glad you could make it
rick seats himself at the visitors window
cant really discern who sits on which side
he picks up the phone
i took off work to be here
so what do you want
i want to see your boys
i dont think thats a good idea
im their mother
you forfeited that obligation remember
thats not fair
you abandoned your kids
i did not
i left them in the care of their loving father
theres a difference
i just want to see the boys
you think they even know who you are
im their mother
you keep saying that
i know things can never go back to the way they were before
rows of men are lined up outside the bedroom door
a man buttons his shirt and exits
cindy lies in bed smoking a cigarette
cindy appears impatient
lets keep the attorneys out of this and settle things like civil adults
rick watches melanie and the boys play nintendo
the boys run to their father
melanie moves to rick and gives him a kiss
this is a surprise
leave work to spend the day with us
come on guys
someone is here to see you
a beat rick
rick leads the boys out the door
from melanies pov looking out a window as rick loads the boys into their mothers car
cindy closes the car door
theyll be here
ricks pov he watches cindy back out and leave
melanie packs her things
where are you going
anywhere youre not
what about the boys
what about me
im all about second chances but not when i come in second place
what are you talking about
why was she here
what was that
shes their mother
ive been more of a mother than she ever was
shes their mother
who willingly walked out of their lives
shes their mother
you keep saying that
you think this is easy
you think raising these boys is something i want to do alone
every day is like a prison sentence
every thing i do every decision i make is directly affected by the boundaries of my responsibility
i have three children but i have no me
everywhere i go people stare at me
dressed as dirty paupers rick and the boys hold tin cups out to the passing by
they stare at me and i know what theyre thinking
a pedestrian drops a coin in ricks coffer
you poor poor man
you poor poor children
how unfortunate to only have your father
how terrible it must be not to know your mother
melanie finishes packing her suitcase
what about zach
how noble of you to be the only single parent in the world
how stoic you are
so concerned with the best interests of your children
their best interest is walking out the door
melanie exits slamming the door behind her
against a burning sky rick waits in the drive
her hair is strewed
the boys pile out of the car and gather round their mommy
she kneels to their level
when can we see you again
is someday tomorrow
someday is someday baby
give your mom a hug guys then get in the house
the boys hug their mom and then run to the door
a tear wells in cindys eye
i thought things had changed
i am who i am rick
im not cut out to be a mommy
i could have told you that
i had to give it a shot
rick turns to walk away
ricks pov sees the boys looking out the door
rick turns back around to cindy
at whose expense
at whose expense
whos going to dry their tears tomorrow when they realize your never coming back
whos going to rock them to sleep at night when they ask why mommy doesnt love them
you are and you wouldnt have it any other way
a furious pull back zoom to cindy standing in front of a door marked solitary
she steps in
the door slams behind her
rick is donned in crisp business attire
he and the boys sit at the breakfast table
is mel coming today
i dont know buddy
i love mel
she loves you too
the clock unwinds
rick sits on the sofa his remote control in hand
unkempt he has a rough growth on his face
yelling dont you yell
if you have something to say come here and tell me
phillips in the closet rick unlocks the closet door and lets phillip out
what were you doing in there
who locked the door
rick on the sofa
the boys gathered at his feet
he has a heavy growth of facial hair
he shirt is unbuttoned
his shoes have been discarded
he stares blankly forward
the boys lay sleeping at his feet
one by one people show up and begin to remove the furnishings
an open door allows service providers to enter and disconnect
first the gas then the telephone
close up on a running faucet that slows to a trickle then a drip then dry
ricks mother and father enter
she sits by her unresponsive son
father lingers at a distance
she stuffs a few dollars in his pocket as the cable guy shows up
the reception on the tv turns to snow
take care of my babies
rick never acknowledges her
she kisses him on the forehead and leaves
close in on a bed where ricks parents lay
what are you giving him money for
to help him through the hard times
hes a good father just having a rough go
ive never met a good father that couldnt support his kids
a man enters to repossess the tv
people continue to enter the house taking ricks belongings
on ricks mom
you could watch the boys while he works
im too old for that
the better side of life has passed me by
what if they fall
i dont hear like i used to
what if one of them was seriously hurt and i didnt hear their cry
i hate that the only thing i feel competent to do is give them money
i love my son and i love my grandbabies but how would i live with myself if something happened to those children
slowly pulling up and away reveals another cell
a representative from the electric company stands in front of rick
sir youre months behind on your electric bill
rick reaches in his pocket and pulls the funds his mother has given him
takes the cash
its a start but not nearly enough
exits shutting off the lights behind him
the strike of a match and a candle is lit
in the flicker of the flame rick has a look of desperation
he holds a gun
ricks pov looking down on his sleeping children
the howl of the wind and the candle is extinguished
a wail pierces the darkness and then a gunshot
a bang against the bars wakes rick and the boys
i always knew you were a lifer
rick sits across the desk from an adoption agent
because of their age it may take awhile
well start them out in foster care but eventually theyll all be placed in loving nurturing environments
the boys are loaded in a wagon and pulled away from rick by an unrecognizable couple
a small hand painted sign that hangs from the back of the wagon reads bon voyage
from ricks pov the boys move further and further away
kris tries to christen the wagon with plastic bottled water
from the boys pov their waving father fades in the distance
rick snaps back from his daydream
theyll be together though right
stevens i wish i could make that promise but the odds of an adoptive family willing to take them all is astronomical
come on guys were out of here
im sorry i made a mistake
rick sits at the picnic table reading a book
the boys are off playing
he grabs his knee and cries
rick drops his book and runs to the child
guards on duty pay no attention
rick reaches the child
the injury appears rather serious
can i get some help here
his calls go unanswered
a tear forms in his eyes
months of frustration boil in his face
a convict passing by kneels by rick
can you help me
can you help him
i dont know
what does he need
i dont know
he needs a father not a book reading baby sitter
in a hushed rage i cant fucking do this
yes you can
the convict runs his hand over the childs leg and everything appears healed
use your mind and your heart
its different than it ever should have been
but different isnt wrong
use what you have
there is a vein of wealth inside you just waiting to be mined
think differently than you have ever thought before
worker harder than you ever thought you could
love these children like theyve never been loved before
the answer lies within
quit worrying about how these misguided events have torn your life apart
quit dwelling on all of your misgivings
look around you
youre not alone
but you and you alone will make the difference
rick notices his cell door is unlocked
he steps into the corridor
ricks pov walking past cells he sees people he knows
his mother and father appear very old
melanie is at mrs
zach clings to her leg
john talks away his phone
rick and the boys wait for their caseworker
a pregnant woman and her twelve children sit a few seats away
her face and clothes are as dirty as her childrens
rick looks at his watch and then at her and then back to his watch
he slips the watch off his wrist and hands it to her
its not worth a lot maybe a few hundred bucks but it might keep you in soap for a year
a caseworker comes to rick
stevens i can see you now
rick and the pregnant woman lock eyes
i aint some charity case
i know what you think when you look at me
you think look at that poor poor woman
look at those poor poor children
how unfortunate it must be that they only have a mother
how terrible it must be not to know their father
i didnt mean it like that
no one ever does
rick and the woman continue their stare
i can see you now
im sorry im going to have to reschedule
rick is reading from a large textbook and jotting in a notebook
he wears his glasses
his boys come to him
taking a break from studying he lays his glasses on the table
the boys pile into his lap
nicky holds a storybook
rick opens the book so all can see
once upon a time
the cell once again transforms into a small suburban house
one by one things lost are replaced
rick is eating pizza and looking through the want ads
a few ads are already circled
daddy im hungry
nicholas pulls his shirt up to reveal his stomach
its very very empty
rick hands him whats left of his pizza
he takes a swig of beer
daddy im thirsty
rick takes a long look at his beer
get your coats on
were leaving guys
rick has a cart full of groceries at the check out line
an older woman stands behind him
the clerk rings up a final total
thirty two hundred and fifty six dollars
rick looks dumb founded
think its bad now
wait til theyre teenagers
rick loads boxes of cereal kool aid spaghetti os loaves of bread and numerous other things into a trough
the boys dance in excitement
rick and his mother walk along
mom i have an idea but i need your help
ricks mom reaches in her purse
put your checkbook away
what i need you cant buy
what do you need
for you to believe in me
rick his parents and the boys pound a sign into the front yard that reads mow em and grow em lawn care
cindy is pushing a grocery cart when melanie and her new boyfriend pass
melanie stops in her tracks turns around and after a brief beat approaches cindy
i know you
ricks ex wife
and you are
can i ask you a question
what is phillips favorite color
his favorite color is blue
how many teeth has kris lost
i dont know
two on top and two on bottom
he got a quarter for the first one fifty cents for the next two and he parlayed the last into an even dollar
nicholas cries at night because he thinks the house is filled with ghosts
kiss him once on the forehead once on the cheek and sing the cradle will rock and hell sleep the whole night through
kris favorite subject is math
he loves to read and write but he doesnt do so well in social studies
he knows how to ride a bike
because i taught him
phillip wants to learn but hes always afraid hell fall
nicky just likes to flintstone his tricycle
phillips favorite cartoon is tunenami
mel anie contd hes afraid of the dark and cries himself to sleep at night saying his mommy doesnt love him
whats your point
im more their mom than youll ever be
so why are you here with slick and not with your kids
yeah they do
now if youll excuse me i need to find the asparagus
a beat i couldnt do it ya know
melanie turns back around
i always thought i wanted to be a parent and i was really good at being pregnant but i sucked as a mom
i know that now
i dont have what it takes
i dont think ive ever felt as much pity for anyone as i do for you right now
take care of my boys
all of them
rick and the boys stand by the river looking up a huge embankment
there appears to be no permanent trail
looking up scattered people sit at different levels on the climb
well guys i guess this is it
we can do it daddy
yes we can
rick stretches out
the boys jog in place
rick cracks his neck
the boys crack their knuckles
in slow motion they begin their ascent running wildly up the incline
rick falls flat on his face
the boys all trip over him leaving them all in a pile
rick bounces up and dusts himself off
the boys do the same and away they go
rick and the boys are on their hands and knees with hand trimmers snipping away at the lawn
rick caries the boys
phillip is draped across his shoulder
nicholas hangs around his neck
kris clings to ricks leg and is dragged with each step
they pass a weary climber who has taken a moment to catch his breath
you can do it
yes we can
rick is using a push mower on this huge estate
nicholas follows behind with a bubble mower
the boys are dragging rick up the hill
rick and the boys are crowded onto the seat of a large commercial mower
the boys do a victory dance at the top of the hill their arms extended far above their heads
kris stops for a moment and then tugs at his fathers shirt
rick tries to ignore the child but then stops mid dance
what is it kris
kris points up
rick is looking through college literature insurance applications and ymca programs
rick holds a college pamphlet
ricks pov he looks at the pamphlet then up to see they arent even close to the top
they have just reached a plateau along the way
we can do it
through a weary voice
yes we can
rick wears his painters pants
the boys are armed with an assortment of paintbrushes
paint cans and ladders adorn the room
rick and the boys continue their climb
the breaths are heavy but they march steadily upward
rick and the boys hand in hand walk toward the church
rick stands back and looks at one finished wall
kris mimics his father backing up to have a look for himself
too late kris has tripped over a can of paint
as he sits on his butt a look of fear crosses his face a tear forms in his eye
rick takes his paintbrush and dots kris on the nose
phillip and nicholas are quickly engaged in painting each other and a full blown paint war ensues
a choir of voices sings
melanie and her boyfriend sit in silence
what did i do
not you its me
melanie looks her boyfriend square in the eyes runs her hand down his cheek
melanie exits the car and runs down the street
rick and the boys stop to rest
kris throws a rock while rick is looking away
rick looks up to find phillip picking up a stone
put the stone down
no buts put the stone down
off screen sfx a huge thud and someone rolling down the hill
i knew this was a hard climb but
a resting climber appears
long way up
long way down for that matter
so whats your point
no point just an observation
the climber holds out a canteen
for the boys
daddy im thirsty
rick studies the climber for a moment
the climber hands the boys the canteen
you know if you stop here halfway between a long way up and a long way down you really havent accomplished much have you
were not stopping
were just resting
thats what i said fourteen years ago
rick looks toward the top
we can do this
yes you can
a reinvigorated rick hops to his feet
we can do this
yes we can
rick is back on the stage
the audience is full
what is so important mr
stevens that you would burden this court with convening today
i just needed clarification
on what mr
i know if i have to i can do this alone but do i have to do this alone
a hushed murmur rises in the audience
the judge raps his gavel on the bench
order in this court
a beat as things quiet down
your inquiry mr
is it in the best interest of the children or in the best interest of you
i dont know
he doesnt know
he just doesnt know
i dont know
then this court sees no reason to amend the original verdict
the order stands
tell it to someone who cares mr
i have laid my heart out on the line time and time again only to walk away empty handed
this love this caring this sharing of life its a sentence and my heart has been condemned
it doesnt matter who ive told whats in my heart is never quite enough
the people i have cared for most have shunned me in life and in love
unanswered phone calls
unnoticed displays of affection
a rose that withers on the doorstep
no matter what i do its never enough
just once just one fucking time i want to be enough
your only condemnation is self pity
you have people that care all around you but youre too blind to see them
if you dont pull yourself together soon my friend they soon will all be gone
in b w slo mo rick stands watching his sons play
the wind blows the leaves of a tree
the boys run further and further out until they are out of sight
rick calls out to them
slowly across the field three young adults return
rick is now an old man hunched over and aged with wrinkles
the three young men walk beside their elderly father supporting him with each step
rick is holding flowers
the boys have an assortment of instruments to add a serenade
the music is a mishmash of odd notes that could only be construed as music to a parents ear
melanie stands on the front porch her arms crossed
what do you want
im a proud man sometimes foolish
i have a long way to go before i could ever be the man you need me to be
and i got confused between what i should have done and what i thought was right
yes you did
i put you on a pedestal and then i knocked you down
it wasnt fair
lifes not fair rick
you were more a mother to my boys than they have ever known
you were more a woman to me than i have ever deserved
youre not going to make this easy are you
cut the bullshit rick
rick wraps his arms around melanie and pulls her in for a hug
in mels ear i can live my life alone
i can raise my kids alone
i can walk this path alone
id much rather do it with you
grabbing him by the collar shes torn
melanie shakes her head
she turns to go inside
turning back around
i shouldnt have come here
no you shouldnt have
rick turns to leave
you just dont get it do you
youre here for you you selfish prick
melanie lays in bed covering her ears
days go by when i lose me
there are nights when i lay in bed and i can hear zach through the walls
hes crying out for me and i lay there motionless wishing i was anyone but me anywhere but here thinking that somewhere sometime there has to be room for me
but that someday never seems to come
loving you means i lose me
and i will never lose let that happen
mel anie vo contd so dont come knocking on my door asking for my heart if you dont have room for me
melanie enters the house closing the door behind her
rick tosses the flowers on the porch turns and walks away
the boys follow behind
i could have looked sad
i can look sad too
but i look sadder
nicholas starts to cry
rick falls flat on his face
he lays there motionless
dont quit daddy
rick pounds the ground pulls himself up dusts himself off and with a determined look starts back up the hill
daddy doesnt quit
rick and john sit at the bar
you love her
i think so
i dont know
if you think youre in love you are
i suppose i am
does your heart skip a beat when she walks by
shes my best friend
does your heart skip a beat when she walks by
do your palms sweat when you think about her
does she inspire you
with music and poetry
and is there passion
and have you ever told her this
have you ever told her this
dont you think you should
it only confuses things
loving your best friend confuses things
i cant think of a love more lucid
rick stands to leave
you know ill never forgive you for this dont you
you had the power and the dream at your fingertips and youre giving it all away
you didnt marry your best friend
i thought you had things all planned out
affairs of the heart and those of the mind are two different things
its not too late you know
with a shrug john drops to one knee in front of rick
go home john
go home and talk to your best friend the way you talk to me
rick bursts through the front door
his mother appears aghast
i need you to watch the boys
but youre father
ricks father enters
no more excuses
its time to live life and enjoy our grandkids
to rick go
the boys will be fine
cant we just give him money to pay for a baby sitter
rick bolts out of the house
melanie is working as a waitress
shes pouring coffee when she sees rick
to herself oh shit
the cup has nearly reached the brim
pay attention would ya
rick reaches her
what do you want
melanie is at the next customer who early awaits a refill but she doesnt pour
so where are the boys
theyre at my parents
not going to use them to try to persuade me with guilt
is that what you thought
i have a son of my own
i know when people are using their kids
to customer excuse us for a moment okay
id just like some coffee
melanie walks off
rick grabs a cup from a recently vacated table and sets it in front of the patron
excuse me miss
what is your problem
the coffee its cold
rick picks up the cup pulls a lighter from his pocket and runs it several times under the mug
setting the cup back down
quit your bitching
rick moves to melanie
i cant believe you came here
i cant believe youre a waitress
beats chasing around after snot nosed brats all day
i thought you liked my kids
i was talking about you
melanie moves on
rick gives chase
he catches her and spins her around spilling coffee all over the floor
i deserved that
so what do the kids need
a surrogate mom
this isnt about the kids
then whats it about
its about me the selfish prick
hear me out okay
looking at her watch
you have seconds
melanie there is a grace about you that reminds me how clumsy i am
there is an honesty about you that reminds me how deceitful i can be
there is a beauty in your eyes that reminds me how ugly ive become
there is a kindness in your voice that contradicts my coarseness
there is a glow around you that illuminates my dullness
there is spirit in you that challenges my laziness but most of all there is a woman in you that sparks my desire a desire to be graceful and honest
and beautiful and kind
a desire to be better than i am or ever thought i could be
i think my ten seconds are up
melanie sets the coffee on a nearby table
get it yourself
i love you
i dont think i heard you
if i give you my heart will you promise to treat it softly
kiss it when it hurts
put it in a box and know that it belongs to you
thats not what you said
i said i love you
as brutal as that can be
i love you
i love you i love you i love you
i kind of like you too
rick comes to another plateau and finds melanie waiting for him
i never thought youd make it
been waiting long
i never thought youd find me
i had to find me first
i hope you plan on walking cause im not sure i can carry you
so how do we do this
the two begin the ascent together
one step at a time
side by side
maybe you could carry me
rick jumps in melanies arms
they tumble to the ground under his weight
rick packs his things in boxes
a knock at the door and the room morphs back into the cell
rick turns around to see the jailer standing at the door
getting out of here huh
its time to move on
if you leave dont ever come back
not even on a visit
youre a very ugly man
id hate to explain to the other guards why youd come to visit me
ricks mom and the boys are playing
grandma i love you
i love her more
i love her the whole universe
i love you all the whole universe plus one
rick and melanie walk across the stage
so this is where it all happened
its funny the tricks the mind can play on you
but the judge he sat right over there
and the jury sat right there
and the audience was filled with all these people who didnt really give a shit about me
a bunch of innocent bystanders
and they all sat passing judgement on me not knowing the situation just staring over their schoolmarm spectacles and pointing their crooked fingers
all the worlds a stage
always casting dispersions
rick walks off leaving melanie at center stage
she looks around
the faint echo of a judges gavel can be heard in the distance
guilty as charged
did you hear that
nothing at all
pan reveals rick melanie the boys and john sit watching a ball game
the secret of life melanie is to always pay attention
a pregnant carrie returns to her seat carrying a box of hotdogs and drinks
always be prepared for whats right around the corner
the crack of the bat
johns pov a foul ball is screaming in his direction
