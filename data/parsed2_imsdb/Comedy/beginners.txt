written by mike mills a single daisy stands in a vase in an empty kitchen
oliver fields clicks on the light to the closet
he looks at the rack of his parents clothes
he begins to put some in a box marked home some in a box marked thrift
oliver enters the bathroom and flushes bottle after bottle of pills and liquids down the toilet
next he struggles as he looks over the old toothbrush hairbrush all the bottles and tubes besides the sink
he stares for a beat then throws them all away
oliver hauls trash outside adding it to a very large pile of bags
an older jack russell terrier arthur follows him
oliver and arthur sit on the office floor surrounded by papers boxes books and trash bags
he finds a photo of hal fields in an open jean jacket no shirt its attached to a personal ad application which he begins to read
in the dark oliver fields has a tape recorder and microphone he follows andy as he excitedly prepares a group of friends looks on

until she died in their bed after four months of cancer and eating french toast for every meal and watching the teletubbies everyday and confusing white straws for her cigarettes
and skipping back and forth through time inside her head
hal fields sits on a couch in a purple sweater looking into camera struggling for words
six months later my father told me he was gay
he had just turned
same camera angle hal still looking into camera we jump cut to him wearing a robe
i always remember him wearing a purple sweater when he told me this but actually he wore a robe

he changed all his clothes
the camera moves through a large group of men and streamers gathered for los angeles pride event
he got a boyfriend andy a physical trainer who was also studying for his professional pyrotechnic license
camera lands on hal beaming with pride his arm around andy who looks into camera and says

oliver walks through the living room arthur follows
oliver makes a circle through the house arthur follows
oliver sits looking down at arthur

arthurs face looks up at him filled with a dogs love and no words
while i understand up to words i dont talk
oliver leans down pushing his head into arthurs
camera follows oliver down a long corridor
oliver sits as hal lays in a coma on a ventilator
the room is dark oliver uses a flashlight to quietly read to his father
a nurse opens the shades
a doctor and two nurses stand over hal everyones nervous
hal is struggling with all the tubes down his throat
oliver is trying to help him breathe talking into his ear
oliver is ushered out of the room
the nurse draws the curtain
moments later oliver sits with hal now off the ventilator but still very weak and disoriented
oliver coaches his breathing
calm calm breaths
its the middle of the night hal is connected to many i
s in both arms still disoriented hes tangled up in the tubes trying to pull them out of his arms
he wakes up oliver
please help me with all these ropes
oliver rushes and helps him
pop pop stop youre gonna hurt yourself
a nurse quickly enters and helps hold down his arms
fields were going to have to secure your arms again
she puts his hands in restraints oliver helps

the nurse smiles embarrassed and continues with her job
shes a great nurse in the hospital we dont really know her youre very high on drugs
you always have some very good reason havent you
no pop i just dont want to be like you and mom
aside to the nurse thank you
in the kitchen we see year old oliver watching his mother georgia and father kiss quickly politely and then his father leaves quickly
hal remains in silhouette through the shot
different day in olivers bedroom oliver watches hal and georgia kiss and hal leave more like a performance than anything real
different day in parents bedroom oliver watches hal and georgia kiss and hal exit quick and dry
year old oliver studies them each time
different day olivers bedroom georgia quickly opens the door and finds oliver drawing
he turns and georgia shoots him with her finger oliver falls to the ground
olly you can do better
he gets up and she shoots him again he falls more dramatically knocking his head on the floor
his mom looks at him affectionately
oliver walks arthur across a lit field towards the dog park
everywhere dogs and their people are playing
oliver and arthur sit on a bench like two humans
oliver watches the action arthur stares at oliver
go have your own experiences with your own people
ill be right here
arthur stays by olivers side
im a human
im not a dog
and youre a jack russell thats a breed
your personality was created by this guy john russell a hunting enthusiast in the s
and he bred your ancestors to have stamina and courage for the hunt
you think youre just you and you want to chase the foxes but other people planted that in you years ago
now somewhat arbitrarily you are considered very cute by us humans and we keep breeding you not to chase foxes but to be cute and we put you in movies
and television shows and you youre chasing tennis balls cause there as close to a fox as youre going to get
arthur stays by olivers side
cu on olivers hands as he draws a t shirt that reads my personality was created by someone else and all i got was this stupid t shirt
reveal that oliver is in a design office
liz s enters they improv hellos
jump cut thru a series of olivers drawings
a speech bubble that reads a fair amount of failures
he draws portraits of girls with dates ellen o
oliver stops drawing lost in his thoughts
in the dark i
room hal is still attached to many i
s oliver is helping hal look at a book of japanese rock gardens with a flashlight
want me to read this
i found it in your books

oliver opens it they look at a few pages together photos of serene gardens
oh thats nice
hal keeps peeking at a bouquet of flowers in the corner of the room
hal takes the flashlight from oliver and guides it to the flowers
oh andy brought those for you
hal continues to direct the light across the room we follow the circle of light as it moves a cross a wall landing on a painting
oh who did that painting
well i dont know
its just a painting on the wall
hal continues exploring olivers enjoying his fathers curiosity he lands on some photos displayed on the table
a and these
theyre just photos pop
but how do they relate to the exhibit
theyre just personal photos
theyre not art
hal slowly moves the flashlight up the wall across the ceiling to a strange assortment of fire detectors sprinklers sensors all laid out against the acoustic tile ceiling
hal points up
oliver looks for a beat then
uh well thats the water sprinkler thing
well its beautiful
putting the japanese gardens there
its just beautiful
oliver looks from the ceiling to the rock garden book
the ceiling and the gardens look the same
oliver is moved by hals confusion
andy years old physical boyish storms into the room
andy gets on the bed opposite oliver
he gives hal a big kiss on the lips
oliver backs away slowly
andy picks up hals hand turns it palm up and presses his face into it
i brought something for you
oliver watches from outside the room as andy excitedly pulls a portable tape player out of his bag
we made a recording for you
andy pushes play on the recording we hear andys voice this is for our friend hal fields
we love you
we hear voices hooting and then large fireworks laughter and clapping
oliver watches his fathers happiness from a distance
cu on olivers hands drawing bright streaming colors of the fireworks
later oliver gets to his real work pulling out a few x photos of a band the sads
there are some instructions on record company letterhead he is to do an album design for their new record they want him to draw portraits of the three members
oliver begins to do quick portraits of them based on the photo
another band that wants portraits
well at least it pays the rent
you do something decent once and thats all people ever want
jump cut through the different portraits developing
its not what oliver wants to do
elliott and shauna let themselves in
elliot grabs a stool and sits down
oliver continues to draw as shauna and elliott try to get his attention
the pen is not your friend
the paper is not your friend
the party is your friend
were your friends
your friends are your friends
elliot is now dressed as a cop and shauna as a large chicken they are dancing with no music as oliver sits on a couch depressed dressed as sigmund freud
complete with wig beard glasses pipe
i got the skills
hes got the moves
i got the moves
youve got the skills
oliver elliott and shauna are leaving
arthur cant believe hes being left behind
its actually the first time they will separate
arthur you havent been invited to this party
youre gonna stay and look after the house
oliver tentatively shuts the door takes three steps arthur begins to howl
oliver tries to ignore it but stops again
he looks back at the house and the howling
arthur victorious sits in elliots lap in the front seat while oliver drives and shauna is squeezed in back in her chicken outfit
you remember when oliver was funny
and he could actually like talk in complete sentences
i dont think so fun maybe but not funny unless like serious is funny
then hes fucking hilarious
elliot and oliver laugh
you are very lovable
yeah very lovable
oliver carries arthur they all enter a costume party making their way through the crowd of people in all kinds of disguises music blaring oliver slides into the less populated
a woman rushes up to oliver surprised to see he has a dog
so cute does he do tricks
his names arthur he doesnt do tricks
in the background are a couple dressed as julian and ethel rosenberg we see them observe oliver and arthur
arthur promptly sits down
olivers totally surprised
hes so cute
arthur sticks out his paw
oliver doesnt like seeing arthur blindly perform
oh my god hes so cute i want him
in freud accent does it make you feel powerful to order my dog around
maybe give you a sense of power
oh youre being a therapist
oliver picks up arthur and escapes the kitchen
the rosenbergs are still watching
oliver and arthur sit in a chair next to a couch where a man dressed as a witch complete with green face and long black hair is lying back as
if in a traditional analysis session
well i didnt ask for this
who would ask for this
this cheek this chin
you know this is my life
this isnt a story
this isnt a joke
oliver is playing along but hes really not emotionally ready for this party
he feels very far away
im so glad you came doc
just really good to get this stuff off my chest
in freud accent im sorry
our time is up uh
for this week
thank you for coming in
the witch moves on
oliver sits with arthur in his lap alone lost in all this joviality
we see that the woman dressed as julius rosenberg is watching him
just as oliver is about to get up she plops herself down onto the couch ready for her session
oh i was just i was gonna take a break actually
she pulls out a writing pad oblivious
oliver can tell shes not going to give it up
back in accent well i guess we should start with your mother
the woman writes on her notepad and shows it to oliver never had one
well then your father
she mimes shooting herself in the head and dying
i dont understand
you cant talk
is it a mental problem
do you need analysis
she writes on her pad i have laryngitis thats a physical problem
she smiles at him looks at him a little too long oliver is more and more pulled in by her playfulness she writes why are you at a party if
cu on oliver surprised and impressed by her observation
i was doing such a good job of hiding it
how could you tell
ethel holds up her notebook
she has drawn two eyes
olivers taken by her
clearly im gonna need a drink
she smiles and nods
you stay here yeah
oliver moves to elliot and shauna are deeply engaged in conversation with someone dressed as a pickle and someone dressed as much less colorful chicken
no its just not a natural color for a chicken
motioning to shaunas and look you see what happens when you free yourself from the cage walk away from the factory
you just have no real color
oliver slips past hands arthur to elliot
he scoops ice from the bucket and starts filling two cups
uh oh one
uh oh two
what does that me one two
well thats two two people
a girl and a guy
yeah wow making moves
oliver leaves arthur in elliotts arms
watch him ok
oliver begins to leave his drinks
we see his pov of the woman dressed as julius rosenberg waiting on the couch
oliver slips into one of his memories
intercut the phone rings wakes up oliver he turns on the light answers the phone
pre cancer hal talks excitedly
im not sorry i woke you
i went to akbar tonight
hal and his friends brian and robert make their way through a crowded gay club
hal is by far the oldest and most excited man there
they had wonderfully loud music
in sit in sit in sit
what kind of music is that
probably house music
hal gets a pad and pen to write this down
a bunch of young gay guys dance
hal is on the side dancing by himself hands in the air twinkling his fingers
so did you meet anyone
at the packed bar hal drinks alone
young gay men dont go for older gay men
back to oliver in bed on the phone
you have it easy
oliver snaps out of his memory
he makes his way through the crowd and delivers the drink to her
he looks at her a little too intensely then blurts out
would you like to dance
she happily nods yes
they walk to the dance floor we think olivers going to be shy but he breaks into a kinetic angular dance
shes surprised with us she laughs they have a good time
jump cut through the night oliver julius elliott and shauna are talking to a magician
julius picks a card the magician mixes it into the full deck pops a card into the air it is hers
shauna and elliott can see that olivers coming alive
they dance again now theyre sweaty the dance floors packed its the pinnacle of the party
the partys winnowing down in the background julius and oliver look at each other in the mirror for a beat and then simultaneously take their wigs off revealing their true
shes mouths a silent hi
can i give you my number
she pulls out her pad and pen and hands them to him
as he writes oliver spies arthur sitting in the corner of the bathroom staring directly at him
tell her the darkness is about to drown us unless something drastic happens right now
oliver looks to her
i feel bad dragging arthur to the party
i should get home
it was really nice meeting you
she writes on her pad au revoir au revoir
oliver and arthur walk up the empty street oliver kicking himself for missing his chance with her
his phone rings
on the other end silence
a little breathing the party in background
is that you
one beep means yes
ive always wanted to have a phone call with someone who doesnt talk
you want to do something
okay im parked just right up the street
they hang up
oliver is filled with hope
cut to julius walking out into a pool of street light
they smile at each other but dont say anything
they get into his car
you point ill drive
oliver starts the engine
she points forward and they head off
at the light she points left he follows
down the street she points right
oliver drives up on the sidewalk before the street heads down it for half a block then takes her right
we can hear them laughing
oliver arthur and the woman enter a very fancy hotel lobby
oliver is impressed
she mimes giving him a tour but still doesnt talk
oliver and the woman open the door and enter her suite
they look at each other nervously
they sit on her bed
she steals his pipe puts it in her mouth writes on her pad and shows it to him
oh my mother
my mother died five years ago
in a hoarse whisper oh merd
oh you spoke
im not supposed to
she writes and present him with a new question
my father died two months ago almost three
she looks at him with sincere empathy and surprise
olivers opened up an now everything gushes out he barely knows what hes saying
he he was gay
shes very surprised
he was gay the whole time they were married
he came out after my mother died and uh
he was years old
theres a quiet moment of deep connection
she mouths no dont say sorry
she reaches out and gently runs a finger across olivers brow and the outline of his face hes so vulnerable she lovingly mischievously squishes his face together and messes up
then she leans in and they kiss for the first time delicately
can we just sleep
they lay down she takes his arm and pulls him into spooning her
he pulls the covers over them
oliver wakes still in his clothes
anna is already up
she waves and oliver smiles
anna holds up her notebook who are you
she writes again go to ny
how long are you here when you get back
anna holds up one finger
anna shakes her head and smiles
she gestures smaller
she pantomimes a camera rolling and herself acting
youre filming here
oliver smiles as he interprets her gestures
she makes a casual tossing motion with her hand
just somewhere else
anna only shrugs
she writes more and tosses the notepad on his lap
oliver reads can i see you again
hes very happy
they walk down the long hallway oliver carries her bags anna holds onto arthurs leash
oliver reaches out and holds her hand
they stop and kiss gentle and comfortable with each other
oliver now alone with arthur heading home hes happy
cu on his face as he remembers
repeat scene oliver and annas first kiss tentative and delicate
olivers pov hal and andy kiss lovingly
olivers pov andy comes up behind hal doing the dishes kisses him
hal smiles very happy
olivers pov andy kisses hal in the hospital
oliver and arthur enter his home much more alive than the last time we saw him come through the door
hello house low voice hello oliver
oliver makes two piles of mail one says oliver fields one has a yellow forwarding sticker that says hal fields
the hal fields pile is much bigger
jesus pop you get so much mail
oliver slows and stares at his fathers magazine the advocate
two attractive shirtless men on the cover under the title americas sweethearts
olivers lost in memory
hal its remarkable how well youve recovered from being on the ventilator
hal sits on top of his hospital bed wearing one of his all black outfits looking much healthier
a doctor sits on his bed oliver listens from the side
the bronchoscopy revealed a mass about the size of a quarter
it is located in your lower right lung
cu on hal taking this in
im afraid the biopsy showed its cancerous
it appears to have spread
to the large hilar lymph nodes in your chest and liver
doctor long contd with the already weakened state of your heart and lungs
long talks about treatments oliver drifts back from the conversation slowly retreating to a window in the far corner as we continue to hear dr
long speak we see olivers thoughts fixating on a mass about the size of a surgery isnt possible given its location
we can start radiation treatments and see if youre strong enough for chemo
you will be able to go home
we cut back to hals face stoically digesting the news
do you have any questions
as the doctor leaves
oliver takes his fathers hand
well lets not rush out and tell everyone
no need to get him up a tree
hal takes a moment and composes himself
in his eyes we can see that he knows there is an end to his life
can you read me something
hal hands oliver his advocate magazine he begins to read from tough guys do dance
the brazilian ballet star is already known not only as a skilled partner but also as a gifted and versatile dancer who adeptly fields roles ranging
camera tracks out of the room leaving the two men alone
series of cu jump cuts we see olivers hands as he draws a series of silhouetted figures hanging from trees others happily beheaded all with talking bubbles that say lets
not rush out and tell everyone jump cuts oliver draws another severed head then a woman smoking next to the words first lung cancer
jump to later oliver tacks his drawings to the wall looks at them
he looks down and pets arthur as we hear
yeah hes fine
he sleeps on your bed
but is he eating
hal sits on his bed fully dressed oliver is visiting
yeah yeah hes eating
oh god i worry so much about as andy enters his hands mysteriously cupped together
oh here we are
andy shows hal his cupped hands
what have you got in there
oh andy you cant bring that kind of thing in here
oh i can look
andy flashes open his hands revealing nothing
he snorts and laughs
oliver watches with amusement
nurse sophia enters
its time for inspection
the nurse works her way between andy and hal to take his pulse
andy feels interrupted strangely hurt by the nurse
the nurse begins to take hals vital signs
hals boyfriend im sophia
andy gets more and more upset
you know i have the right to be here as much as anyone else
hal lovingly cuts him off trying to ease the tension
go take a walk
andy walks out feeling embarrassed and rejected
what was all that
oh andy hasnt had it easy
be nice to him
to everyones surprise andy storms back in with a bouquet of flowers dumps them on hals chest kisses him triumphantly and leaves again
knowing he stole them andy where did you get these
jump cuts oliver helps a group of hals gay friends and andy get settled
theyre jovial they come with drinks and flowers the room gets very full
oliver hands out cups offers wine andy lifts his paper cup and makes a toast
guys guys this is to us
a nurse suddenly enters
drinkings not allowed in the room
all the guys freeze
oh its not
she shakes her head no the party stops she leaves
oliver instinctively polite starts packing up their cups
moans and complaints from the group
no no no
shes a wonderful nurse
he pauses a beat then raises his cup again heres to health care
hal swigs back his wine
they all laugh grab their cups and toast
to health care
hal looks happy oliver smiles but cant believe his dad
what did you do with my father
he was so polite
oh i invited him but he never returns my calls
the guys drink merrily
someone shoves a cup into olivers hand pours him a drink
oliver elliott and arthur are shopping in a very old and crowded used book store
oliver picks up a stack of magazines as elliott interrogates him
two four six eight
thats all youre gonna tell me
im gonna meet her at her hotel again
yeah im very happy
are you happy
oliver drops his books on the counter to check out
to shop owner heres eight
turns to elliot
we havent actually had a conversation yet so you know
the three are now in olivers car
youre thinking about her all the time
and you know that because
because youre not talking about it
i know you
theres a pause then the truth
im and falling for a girl again
georgia works at her writing table
young oliver bored watches her
its like i lost the instructions or i i never had them
young oliver walks up to georgia
at the museum
is something wrong with you guys
georgia is startled she hides her feelings with humor
whatre you in the fbi
oliver shakes his head no sla
oliver sits silently
there is nothing wrong with me and pop
georgias mask breaks revealing sadness
oliver can see it she can see he sees it
georgia gets up and leads oliver out of the room
they stand in front of his bedroom door
when you feel bad you go into a room and scream loud as you want for a minute or two then its out of you
its called catharsis
she opens the door pushes him inside and closes the door
young oliver pauses confused in his room
he doesnt scream
he comes back out
i dont feel like screaming
georgia never ruffled
oliver and arthur watch from the car as elliott gets a can of spray paint heads to a blank wall across the street and sprays a large tag on a
he then runs back to the car looks proudly at his work
what the fuck is that
l e it elliot well thats ridiculous
getting his criticism more youre not very supportive
well its just copying something someone did like years ago in the bronx
im part of a tradition of civil disobedience something bigger than myself
oliver cant believe elliott said that
elliott drives along side oliver whos walking with a spray paint can terrified as hes never done this before
he tries to spray nothing comes out
how does it work
shake it you have to shake it
oliver shakes it awkwardly then sprays across the wall oliver runs back to the car exhilarated
what was that
you know something bigger than myself
lets do it again
elliott drives off
olivers coming to life
okay but when you see her dont tell her that you painted historical consciousness on the wall
we see more of olivers graffiti on different buildings oliver exits his house alone down his front stairs to the street
halfway down he hears now familiar sound of arthur barking and howling
oliver cant believe it
anna is sitting on the bed gently petting arthur
he misses your dad
gets up nervous and walks past oliver into the next room
oliver follows her in
they pause uncomfortably anna suddenly leans in and kisses him
before it goes to far
maybe we we could um just talk for a second
they awkwardly break apart
anna goes to a chair oliver follows
while nothing has really been expressed between the two anna seems to understand the problem
well my name is anna
youre worried you cant trust me because you dont know who i am
i get it
that makes sense to me
she falters looks at him vulnerably
oliver abruptly kisses her
she pushes back
she traces his brow slowly with her index finger the way she did their first night
the music carries us they lie in bed naked
anna innocently leans over and takes olivers arm and bites down hard
she stops and kisses it admiring her teeth marks
she gets up sits at a side table and finds her cigarettes
oliver watches her
the music seems to bend and slow down this continues as we fall into memory
cu on young olivers hand pushing on a record making the bending slowing sounds
oliver stop it
oliver stands up bored georgias in the connecting bathroom getting ready to go out
this musics old
its black black music is the deepest cause they suffered the most them and the jews
oliver plops down on the bed listening to her
in my next life im gonna marry a good hot blooded jew someone full of emotion
im jewish right
georgia comes and sits with him caresses his hair as she talks with him
youre a quarter im a half your fathers none
he has the least emotions youll have more emotions than him but ill have the most emotions
she likes that she has the most emotions
they head out
you get to play chauffeur but just to the bottom of the hill
year old olivers in the driving sear georgia smokes and admires his handling of the car
youre turning into a wonderful driver
oliver escorts georgia up the large steps of the museum
the crowd from an opening gathers at the top
georgia and oliver approach a david smith sculpture
after staring at its angels for a beat georgia begins to do an angular modern dance pantomime of the sculpture imitating its shapes with her body
oliver locks up with embarrassment
a confused and concerned museum guard approaches
excuse me mrs
youre not allowed to interact with the art
its just that
still embarrassed oliver takes georgias hand and walks her away from the guard
you like being a good citizen
annas sits in her kimono
olivers buttoning his shirt
can you toss me my camisole
oliver throws a sweater
no my camisole
she throws the sweater back at him
oliver looks around helplessly
he grabs a flower out of a vase and hands it to her
you dont know what a camisole is
i was brought up by these animals and they didnt like questions
theyre both smiling now
they were very frowned upon
so i had to guess
anna takes this in
you can ask me anything
cut to oliver and anna at the window
whats out there
thats a tree
another building like this one
people in the building like us
half of them think things will never work out
the other half believe in magic
its like a war between them
he moves away from the window
how do you know so much about people
well you have to learn how to read their faces
she climbs onto his lap straddles him
here is mad
anna passes her hand across her face and shes mad
her hand passes again and shes happy
sometimes its just nothing
she points at her blank face
this is nothing
and they are good at looking one way and being another way
her playfulness is very meaningful to oliver hes in love
they walk through a caged in freeway overpass oliver is carrying arthur while blindfolding anna with his hands
over this we hear the sounds of the quiet hotel room and an intimate conversation between them
you dont know me
i like that
no thats not true
yeah you have blonde hair that goes down to about here
you smoke in non smoking rooms
oliver is still covering her eyes leading her to a certain point the busy sound of the freeway fading up
okay open your eyes
high angle on huge trucks and traffic racing just beneath oliver and annas feet under the overpass
the trucks lay on their horns as they pass scaring and thrilling them
moments later they walk alongside the la river together arm in arm happy
the intimate conversation continues in voice over
you drive on the sidewalk
you were raised by animals
sometimes you look very alone like you just got here
they meet up with friends on the banks of the river
yeah you see you dont know me at all
oliver and arthur are leaving walking down the long hallway together
arthur seems to stop and look up at oliver
shes unlike any girl ive ever met
oliver stops and looks at arthur
someone flashy walks into your life and youre just gonna fall for it
are we married yet
no uh it doesnt work like that
there are other steps its complicated
they look at each other a beat and then walk on together
i hope this feeling lasts
oliver is shaving hals face
what happened with michelle
i dont know
she seemed great
she was great
maybe you should take out a personal ad where you explain your situation
yeah i mean you want to be in a relationship but you cant stay in one
thats your fatherly advice
well a lot of people use them
if andy wasnt going to be monogamous why should i be
hals friends hold up a hand made welcome home sign in the living room
oliver helps hal walk to his crew andy at the center holding arthur
hello house answers back in deep voice hello hal
andy holds arthur
hal and arthur kiss
theyve clearly missed each other
jump cuts oliver takes bottles of pills and syrups and inhalers out of a sav on bag
he makes a chart of the medicine the dosage and puts the pills in a dish
its emotional job for him
oliver watches as andy sneaks up behind hal with his hands cupped closed
hal turns and smiles
oh god what have you got this time
its a green caterpillar
no no no you dont have a green caterpillar
oh yeah i do
andy opens his hands to reveal he actually does have a green caterpillar
oh my god
andy puts the caterpillar down on the saucer of hals tea cup gives him a big kiss and starts to leave
hey you going
yeah michaels in town
andy waves goodbye and leaves
hal is sad but covering it up
he catches oliver watching
i thought he was your boyfriend
well at least im the number one boyfriend
hal grimaces in pain doubles over
oh my stomach
alright come on
oliver tries to clear the couch of books and dogs for hal to sit down
well lets say when you were little you always dreamed of some day getting a lion
oliver eases hal down onto the couch
and you wait and you wait and you wait and you wait and the lion doesnt come
then along comes a giraffe
oliver helps hal get his feet up
you can be alone or you can be with the giraffe
id wait for the lion
oliver grabs the oxygen tubes and puts them on hals face
thats why i worry about you
hal looks at oliver with love and concern
cu on olivers hands as he writes the history of sadness
cut to him drawing an explosion with the caption earth begins sadness not yet invented
he draws a man and a woman with the caption first couple to marry for wrong reasons
he draws a spilled glass invention of alcohol ancient egypt
he draws a mans face and torso first gay man accused of being mentally ill
he draws a man labelled present having been crushed by a giant boulder labelled oliver stops drawing thinking of a conversation with his father
cut to hal on his couch previous scene talking to oliver

arthur runs down the hotel hallway followed by oliver they come to a corner and anna jumps out scaring them they laugh and continue on together
oliver and anna are in the overcrowded used book store we saw earlier
oliver sees her down the aisle
hey what did you get
she puts the cover of liv ullmans changing over her face ullmans face on the cover becomes annas
and i found this crazy book
she holds an old copy of the joy of sex in front of her face
thats kind of a classic american thing
anna opens the book to a large drawing of a couple having sex
maybe we can figure out some classic american things to do
oliver takes the book and flips through the pages
yeah like page
or all the way through through
oliver anna and arthur sit at the end of an aisle looking at a book on old hollywood
the book has a photo of louise brooks from the twenties
louise brooks star of silent screen
effectively banned from hollywood in early thirties ended up working as a salesgirl at saks fifth avenue
oliver turns the page we see a photo of veronica lake
oh i love her
she was a pin up model and a film star
success was short lived
series of broken marriages
she struggled with mental illness and alcoholism
she died of hepatitis at the age of
all these actor stories end sad
i can tell you that already
its not a good life
oliver closes the book they share a look and something vulnerable
anna changes the mood pulls out the joy of sex skips through the pages as she talks
now i want real mexican food
she stops on an illustration she likes
and i want to try page
oliver anna and arthur walk up to a typical l
taco truck on the side of the street
there is nothing fancy looking about it
its really good
jump cut theyre sitting on milk crates by the truck ready to take their first bite anna dives in un selfconsciously were not sure what she thinks
what do you think
its so good
olivers so relieved
oh i wasnt sure youd like it
youre an actress and staying in that fancy hotel
anna can barely swallow her huge bite
i like this place
they lie on the bed continuing their conversation side by side looking up at the ceiling together
i used to love hotels
but now im always in a new apartment or
in another hotel somewhere
how do you keep hold of friends
it makes it very easy to end up alone to leave people
you can stay in the same place and still find ways to leave people
she reaches up with her hand their fingers intertwine
you are like that
its what you do
oliver nods yes
they know each other much better than either one knew
so we are the same
yeah i guess so
the look to each other
thumps and loud s music wakes oliver in the middle of the night
he turns the lights on discombobulated
he gets up works his way through the dark house
turning on lights
hals awake hes taken down dozens of books from a wall to wall bookshelf
a huge physical task
maria a nurse is with him
oh did i wake you
handing maria some books thank you maria
to oliver and now that youre here uh would you please put those up there
what are you
prednisone makes you crazy
im just not sleepy
i feel great
oliver and hal are sitting at either side of his desk arthur is in hals lap
the sound from last scene bleeds over
pop you should rest
hal looks sick but energized he shuffles his desk of papers
as soon as i finish these papers
in a different voice right hal
as soon as youre done you can rest
oliver can only sit and worry
anna oliver and arthur are walking in elysian park a view of downtown behind them
olivers looking at her face she notices
nothing youre pretty
jewish girls are not pretty
they can be interesting or cute but not pretty
youre kidding right
thats what my mom told me
she did not
as anna continues to explain the sound begins to fade down
no youre right this girl at school told me that
and i went home and my mom said anna who told you that
and olivers narration fades in over them walking
this is what it looks like when anna tells me about being jewish in
and when i tell her that my mother was jewish
and then my father turned in his gay badge when my mother turned in her jewish badge
and they got married in
my mother didnt know she was jewish until she was
this is what people looked like
and lions and giraffes
this man was man of the year
her father tried to hide that they were jewish
this is the swim team that asked her to leave once they discovered that she was jewish
this is what pretty looked like in
my father realized he was gay when he was
this is what pretty looked like
this is the high school where they first met
this is the war they both went to
and this man was popular when they met again
this is the only place my father could hide and have sex in the fifties
my father said if you got caught my the vice squad you could lose everything
this is everything
my father laid down on a couch like this and told the psychiatrist all his problems in
the doctor told him that homosexuality was a mental illness but it could be cured
not everyone got cured
this is where my parents lived in
and this is the home where the first gay rights group was secretly meeting
while they were reciting their vows here in this church
allen ginsburg was writing his famous poem howl blocks away in this room
who let themselves be fucked in the ass by saintly motorcyclists and screamed with joy
who blew and were blown
ginsbergs reading continues over oliver flips through a mock up he made for the sads its all the happy faces from s advertising that we saw in the last scene
one face per panel
later the three members of the sads and a record company rep arrive
jelly roll morton piano plays we see but do not hear the meeting take place
the sads look at the designs which include many of the history of sadness drawings we have seen now in cd cover format and no portraits of the band
its clear that the sads are not into olivers work
cut to after the meeting the record company rep talks to oliver alone
just do the portrait of them its an album cover right
thats what they want
olivers very disappointed but polite
oliver and arthur leave the office defeated
oliver walks into hals living room carrying his full tray of medication
i know i know
hal begins taking his many pills with each one he pings his glass with a teaspoon as he swallows
the room is cluttered with books
oliver picks up a toppling pile of files from a paper filled side table
hey no no no
thats the gay pride day stuff
just leave those
oliver begins to neaten a messy pile of books on top of a chair
and thats for gay book club
you better leave those too
but what about this chair
is it gay
the chairs not gay
hal gets up and walks to the kitchen his oxygen cannon cord is attached to the pump behind him stopping him short
pop pop the cord wont go that far
oh to hell with it
hal pulls off the oxygen and keeps walking frail but determined
andy enters with a large pilates ball
oh hey whats that
now that youre out of the hospital youll have to exercise get you back into shape
oliver cant believe it
thats a great idea
okay lets try it
ill ill show you how
hals still heading to the sink
yeah later on im gonna make myself some tea
okay ill clean it up
its a little yech
andy walks out hal pours water into a kettle in front of him on the window sill is the same vase from the first scene of the film with some
dead daisies in it
your mothers vase needs some flowers
oliver looks at them frustrated and uneasy
oliver and hal walk amongst all the products
hal wears his portable oxygen and grabs different kinds of papers dumping them in the basket oliver holds
pop you just got out of the hospital you should take it easy
theyre in a new isle hal continues his march
you need to tell andy that youre
hal continues on avoiding looking at oliver
youll tell him wont you
olivers flabbergasted but his dads vulnerability is clear to him
andys on an elliptical trainer through a window we can see oliver approaching with the weight of the world on his shoulders
andy sees him can immediately sense that something is wrong
oliver approaches seriously this makes andy nervous he stops his workout
oliver tries to find his words
you know that i tried to have sex with women
i wanted you to know i tried it just it didnt work
hey i dont have a problem with gay guys
have you ever had sex with a man
i heard that if a man hasnt had sex with another man hes always afraid of gay men
you know theyre a threat
olivers blown away by the logic
i dont know andy
i didnt want you to feel threatened i dont want to have sex with you
what i do most people wouldnt even call it sex
andys relieved he got this off his chest all tension is relieved for him oliver is just confused
andy gives oliver a big sweaty hug
oliver enters as hals finishing the dishes
i couldnt tell him
no its not
you cant hide this from him
he loves you
for someone with so much relationship advice you seem awfully alone
oliver angry but at a loss for words takes the flower vase and leaves arthur follows
oliver and arthur exit a side door go to a planter full of daisies and cuts some for his mothers vase
he looks back arthur
just act natural
when hes not looking well make a run for it okay
we cut to arthur sprinting up a trail in elysian park
oliver and anna chase after him
in contrast to the previous scene there is lightness and laughter here
the three enter the phone is ringing anna is staring at it with dread
oliver looks at her he finally moves to pick it up
it keeps ringing
its my dad
they both watch the phone as it rings and stops
hes that bad
she picks up the phone and gestures for oliver to pick up the line next to him
ill be my dad you be me
in a deep mans voice honey
she gestures again oliver picks up the phone on his side of the bed
anna turns away he can only see her back across the bed
he turns away too
anna continues to talk in a different voice
cest toi cheri
you never call me back
you know i cant stop thinking about you know about it
you are the only one i can tell that to
oliver breaks role turns around looks at her
you should tell mom about that not me
she just looks at him
back into phone
you are my girl
they hang up
shes embarrassed she lightens the mood to get out of this intimacy
now i have to kill you
just as it was going so well
she tosses a pillow over his face and pretends to shoot him twice
she pulls the pillow back tentatively hes smiling
how do you feel about vandalism
its the last question she thought hed ask
i dont know
anna oliver elliott shauna and arthur drive up sunset blvd
they arrive at alvarado park and get out
above them a well lit large blank white billboard
as oliver and elliott get spray paint cans from the back of the car
oliver dont write any of that serious stuff okay
just write something funny
girls like funny
the gang get to the top of the stairs on to the roof where they can see the large blank billboard towering in front of them
you know what
here give me arthur
well just stay here and get arrested
you know thats good
oliver leaves arthur with her and anna and elliott and him head off to the billboard
they climb its structure its high and a bit scary
on the top is a gang plank looking over the city
anna is happy she came
elliott goes to paint the back side of the billboard
oliver meets up with anna over looking the city
im gonna stay here with my new friend the handrail she holds
oliver walks out and writes big letters across the billboard
he makes his way back
annas not where she was he looks and finds her in the gangways between the two billboards with a view to downtown below her
cest beau ici
he comes to her wanting to get beyond the romance somehow
im trying to impress you
gasps ironically really
she walks to him and puts her hands around his head somehow its more intimate and vulnerable now
theyre at the bottom of the ladder
they all run back to their car
oliver anna and arthur walk down the hallway
arthur bolts ahead suddenly getting free of oliver he runs to and old man wearing all black and looking just like hal
oliver runs up to stop arthur
we see the old mans face its not hal but it the resemblance hits oliver too
the man is struggling with his hotel key card
whats with this card
uh do you mind
oliver swipes the mans key the door opens
oliver looks overwhelmed by this ghost
anna senses whats happened
she leads oliver to their room
oliver sits on the bed sinking
anna watches him
she comes to him hugs him
he looked like your dad
she wants to take care of him she lays him back on the bed helps him take his coat off shes sitting on him caressing him oliver is overwhelmed by
somewhere along the line he stopped admitting to himself that he was sick
camera tracks with oliver helping hal into the cancer center
hal is full of life
hal arrives at the cookie plate in the cancer center lobby
cu on the cookie plate
hal sits happily eating his cookie
he is chipper alive without self pity
hal looks into camera olivers perspective as he pulls his shirt off the radiation machine is in the background
hal grandly introduces oliver to the technician
oliver this is blake
hes a wonderful man
cu of the small round registration tattoos on hals chest
i finally got a tattoo
registration purposes of course
anna still straddles oliver shes moved by his story
good for him
oliver continues to tell anna about hal
he did a lot of shopping
bought all these books
and new clothes
hal buying more and more paper oliver helping him
he was obsessed with staples
he bought a lot of plants
olivers very emotional now as is anna
he had a lot of parties
oliver arrives at hals there is a party going on oliver is surprised he carries groceries with him
well glad you could make it
i thought i was making dinner
its movie night
oliver and hal make their way through a crowd of hals gay friends
theyre in party mode
hal you look wonderful
oh im turning the corner on this thing
we loose hal and oliver in the group
twelve of hals gay friends sit around the table in an assembly line of paper folding envelope stuffing labeling stamping
he had these political letter writing parties there was an out gay congressman he was supporting
hal leads the guys as they put the letters together
back to oliver and hal arriving in the kitchen with the groceries
he started telling everyone that he was getting better
theyre finally almost alone
whyre you telling them youre turning the corner
you have stage cancer
its not as bad as it sounds
there is no stage
thats not what it means
what does it mean
it just means its been through other stages
oliver doesnt know what to say he looks through the door at all of hals friends happy laughing partying
he looks back at hal ready to fight him more but for the first time we can see fear and doubt in hals face
what movie are we watching
the life of harvey milk
he was the first openly gay politician
yeah i know who harvey milk is
hal heads back to the party leaving oliver alone in the kitchen overwhelmed
moments later everyone is crowded onto the couches theyre watching the harvey milk film
hal paces and dictates to a secretary
he hired a secretary that he could dictate to
he wrote an essay about religion
hal works with his secretary as oliver looks on
hal pulls the lap top to himself and reads what he has dictated
eventually jesus grew old
he could no longer walk far and he could no longer preach in a loud voice
one day he announced to his apostles that he was departing
the three disciples prayed with him gave him water bathed and fed him
after gasping for breath for several days one morning just as dawn came jesus passed away
you re wrote jesus death
they all laugh
it was so violent we need new stories
oliver goes over and kisses hal on the head
oliver enters and sees hal and andy taking a nap together on the day bed
hal wakes up and waves at oliver
for the first time i saw him really in love
oliver waves back at his father
he sounds amazing
but that must have been crazy for you
anna hugs and kisses oliver
shes both overwhelmed by his need and sympathetic to all that hes lost
later that night the room is dark oliver is asleep
anna is nervously awake
she quietly gets out of bed puts her pants on and sneaks to the door
arthur wakes up and hops to her wanting to follow
she starts to close the door arthur scratches she tries again he scratches
she opens the door arthur trots out into the hallway anna catches up with him
a troubled anna walks down the hallway with arthur
a dark empty ballroom filled with tables
anna sits in the dark and smokes
oliver wakes up slowly figures out that anna is not in bed
oliver now in clothes sleepily looks for anna
oliver enters the ballroom arthur trots to him
he sees anna across the room full of heavy feelings
he sits by her
i couldnt sleep i wanted to walk around
olivers petting arthur
hes confused and hurt
youve lost so much
what if i cant make up for that
if this is too much then we should just stop
oliver gets up and starts to leave annas surprised
she catches up with him puts her arms around him from behind
she forces him to stay there
i dont want to stop
they hold this pose in silence for a beat then surprisingly he hoists her over his shoulder and carries her back to their room
she laughs theyve made it past this trouble
andy has a set up of large fireworks ready to go hal and twelve friends stand by olivers behind
the fireworks go off
it is incredibly loud
big fireworks explode the guys laugh and holler
hal raises his arms up in the air in celebration
as andy lights up some more
oliver covers his ears he yells out
hes still yelling after the explosions stop
the guys all sensing the insanity laugh and yell back at him
olivers laughing now the noise the absurdity
hal and oliver make eye contact
hal yells less strongly than the others but trying
they keep eye contact
they are bonded happy out of their normal confines
oliver comes to hal yelling again
cut to later all the guys spread out across the parking lot looking for arthur who must of fled during the explosions
arthur runs towards camera chasing a tennis ball that anna threw for him
he runs back and jumps onto the bed waking oliver
hes sleepy shes happy wants him to wake up
ah youre awake
arthur says its time to get up he says he has the day off
he talks to you too
your english is not so perfect
and he said ten minutes
hard cut oliver and anna roller skating to carousel music
theyre having a great time being terrible at it
oliver and anna join elliott and shauna on the side of the rink
arthur is half hidden in a duffle bag at their feet
to anna you did really well
yeah i cant believe that was your first time
to arthur you watching all the humans going around and around
the manager of the rink suddenly arrives upset
theres no dogs allowed in the building

if i leave him on his own he loses all control
theres no dogs allowed in the building
yeah but if i leave him in the car he cries he howls
i cant leave him in the car

oliver anna and arthur make their way out the door and down the street in their skates
they roll down the main lobby hallway arthur running behind dodging people as they go
they struggle to skate down the hotel hallway past a maid
sorry excuse us sorry
they enter annas door
oliver anna arthur enter on their skates
still very playful they skate around the big room
the phone rings
annas face falls they both know it must be her father
she musters on trying to have a good time
oliver goes and unplugs the phone
he shouldnt do this to you
the phone in the next room keeps ringing
he awkwardly skates to it and unplugs it
oliver skates to her concerned
even if we dont answer hes still in here points to her head
i go somewhere else hes still here
oliver can relate
your leaving soon
i think you should come to my house and move in with me
would you want a strange girl like me
yeah a lot
shes very moved
do you cook
yes not so sure
she almost cries as she thinks this over
she skates to him puts her arms around him
i would love that
but now im going to have to kill you for sure now
cause im falling in love with you
the sound in the room fades down olivers narration fades in over the shot of them embracing in their skates
anna and i are in a relationship in
this is what the sun looks like and the stars
this is what it looks like when we eat
when we tell each other the stories in our heads
i was born in
anna was born in
this is what the sun looked like
she left home when she was
she lived here and here and here
she had three serious relationships
she left all of them
i had four serious relationships
i left them too
or let them fall apart
we didnt go to this war
we didnt have to hide to have sex
our god fortune allowed us to feel a sadness that our parents didnt have time for and a happiness that i never saw with them
we didnt know how we learned the stories in our heads but sometimes they stop running and i can really see annas eyes in
this is what it looks like when she says i love you in
this is what it looks like when she cries
when she tells me theres always a new empty room waiting for her
they used to make her feel free
now they make her feel the opposite of free
olivers at his desk looking at photos of himself and his mother at a museum exhibit from the s
we see young oliver and georgia an exhibit of stuffed animals a quote on a wall
oliver goes to his notebooks looks through them till he finds a small rainbow sticker
he puts it on the table and thinks
olivers helping hal take his medication hal deals with is mail
with each swallow he pings a glass with a fork
hal opens a letter from a gay rights organization he hands oliver the rainbow sticker we just saw
here that means gay pride
yeah everyone knows that here
he gives hal another pill another reluctant difficult swallow another ping
no they dont
everyone knows about that pop
dont be ridiculous
hals hiding something he doesnt look oliver in the eyes when he asks
did you know about me
oliver shakes his head no
no i just thought you and mom werent in love
we loved each other
but you were gay that whole time
i learned how not to be
i knew i was gay though at dinner parties i was looking at the husbands not the wives
i couldnt have survived if i didnt know that
i just chose not to follow those instincts
what about sex
you guys had sex
she didnt think i was the greatest lover but we made do
look i liked my life the museum our house thats what i wanted
you wanted mom too right
frustrated and angry oliver takes the pill tray into the kitchen leaving hal behind
yes stop that
she proposed to me you know
this draws oliver back into the room
i said look i love you and were great buddies but you know what i am
and then she says that doesnt matter
ill fix that
olivers never heard this part of the story before
ill try anything
the first gay pride flag was made in by a man named gilbert baker
he gave a meaning to each color
this man was president
this was invented this is what movies looked like
on november th
harvey milk was shot and killed
one week later my father opened his annual museum christmas exhibit
he collected stuffed animals from people in the community and put them on display
my father printed a quote from the velveteen rabbit in large type on the wall
the stuffed rabbit asked what is real
and the horse said real isnt how youre made
its a thing that happens to you
when a child loves you for a long long time not just to play with but really loves then you become real
and the rabbit asked does it hurt
and the horse said sometimes
does it happen all at once like being wound up or bit by bit
it takes a long time
thats why it doesnt happen to people who break easily
oliver enters to find hal and andy dancing humorously to loud opera music
hal dances free without restraint full of life
generally by the time you are real most of your hair has been loved off and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints
but these things dont matter at all because you are real and you cant be ugly except to people who dont understand
the music blares as arthur greets oliver
hal comes to oliver andy continues to dance
andys moving in
is that a good idea
hal hugs oliver
just be happy about it
oliver cant just be happy about it
hard cut to olivers design for the sads tacked on his wall a clumsy drawing of a man and a woman with the caption first couple too in love to
reveal a sads band member looking at the design in disbelief
the rest of the band looks at olivers wall of designs there are no portraits of them
we cut into the meeting mid melt down
this is the idea is that its the history of sadness
oliver spreads out an impossible long cd panel design
here this could be your
the panels go on and on
your gonna need a big cd box
jump cut later olivers still trying to talk the band into his idea
four billion years ago earth begins
and the idea is that sadness has not been created yet
jump cut oliver and the record company rep now alone
im sorry too
they shake hands and she leaves
jump cut olivers now alone with arthur in his lap
well that went well

olivers car stands in front of his house
he gets annas suitcase out of his car

shes nervous but tries to get over it
this is the living room
he leads her into the dining room
oliver points to a photo of his parents when they were in their s

oliver continues his tour leading her up the stairs to his room

i emptied these for you

anna looks around not able to deal with the intimacy stability and generosity
are you okay
she wants to be she hides it all by initiating sex with him physical and fast
oliver wakes up he figures out hes alone again
feelings he was trying to overlook come to the surface now
oliver comes into the living room finds anna on the couch
feelings of hurt and mistrust well up in him
nervous at olivers look feeling in trouble she tries to reconnect
i couldnt sleep i didnt want to bug you
oliver cant overcome his mistrust of her and the whole situation
she tries to defend herself honest and vulnerable
i was nervous and excited
i kept thinking maybe im not so lost
why were you crying yesterday
theyre miles apart
oliver deep in thought something building in him
repeat memory young oliver watches his mother and father go through the motions of kissing
oliver and arthur stand outside his house at night
oliver notices annas drawers are still empty
they eat their connection is broken
oliver is moody and distant
oliver alone in the kitchen brooding
anna enters in her kimono
you seem so unhappy with me
well are you happy here
maybe im not perfect at it
i dont really know what im doing
but i want to be here
hes silent distant confused
shes hurt by his silence and mistrust and leaves
we see but dont hear oliver and anna talking arguing through a series of jump cuts
the sound comes back for the last line
i dont know anna
i dont think this is what i am supposed to feel like
anna looks crushed and surprised
i will go back to new york then
she gets up to go
a cab is picking her up anna looks back up at olivers house hoping something will happen nothing does she puts her suitcase in the trunk and gets in
oliver paces by his door
he rests his head against the door lost in a confused sadness we cant tell hes crying
olivers pov as he pushes hals wheelchair down a cold hospital hallway
inside a small doctors office hal oliver and dr
long have a meeting
hal you dont need to come in for any more treatments
stoic and irreverent hal feigns surprise
have i done something wrong
its best that you stay home
hospice can help you more now any more treatments would just cause more pain
im sorry i wish we could do more
you did an excellent job dr
for coming to the party
jump cuts from hal and olivers pov we jump through time as two men deliver and set up a hospital bed in hals living room
and the nurse puts sheets and a blanket on the bed
oliver wheels hals chair in outside the house taking him to see a view of the canyons
hals face reveals hes finally stopped denying the end is near
oliver and hal sit side by side in his new hospital bed its dark and quite and oliver has his hand in hals
you always wanted to hold my hand when you were little
i couldnt you know
i was afraid it would look funny
i wanted to be close you know and my father certainly was never close with me
god i hope i wasnt like that
i can barely remember you from when i was little
i guess i was at work
young oliver walks behind georgia as she meanders through the crowd feeling alone
she turns and finds oliver on her tail
a fancy woman is talking pretentiously about a painting
georgias critical and amused she sidles up to the woman and gently places her head on the womans shoulder
georgia smiles at her casually unnerving
oliver pulls her away
lets go home
cut to oliver and georgia heading away through the gallery
what about your father
what will he possibly do without us
as theyre making their way out of the museum an formal older lady stops them
yes mary its an emergency olivers appendix has ruptured
they look at oliver whos mortified
hes a very composed child
oliver pulls her away before she starts any more trouble
georgias in drivers seat theyre at a stoplight
oliver points left and she turns

up a new street they arrive at the next stop
oliver points left
going in circles
i like it
irreverent but heavy they drive on
oliver and georgia enter
she heads down the hallway to her room young oliver follows behind
she walks down the hallway to her bedroom enters and closes the door
oliver lies on his bed in the half darkness
hes been there a while arthur staring at him
oliver remembers anna on her hotel bed the night they met messing up his hair kissing for the first time
oliver feeling the most lost cant help but look at arthur whos staring him down
we knew it wouldnt work even before we met her
oliver gets this more than ever
something changes inside of him he picks up his cel phone and dials
where where you
oliver arrives with arthur in a hurry
oliver hands arthur a dog bed and a bag of dog food to elliott
youre going to take care of elliott

its an incredibly sad and desperate howl
oliver gets to his car the howling doesnt stop oliver cant ignore it
oliver gets out of the car heads back to house to get arthur
oliver and arthur drive up to a new house
oliver looks at arthur with guilt
oliver watches andy cry as arthur licks him all over
he remembers me
its true olivers surprised
andy closes the door oliver walks the first ten feet to his surprise silence
he walks to the edge of the yard silence
he tentatively gets into his car silence
he drives away
oliver sees the manhattan skyline as they cross the bridge into manhattan
oliver crosses the cold new york avenue
oliver passes a bodega with flowers he pauses
oliver now with a bouquet of flowers in his hand looking for the right number finds her building
on his way to the door he has doubts about the flowers he decides to throw them away
oliver rings her buzzer no answers a stranger leaves the building and he catches the door before it close he enters
oliver makes it to her door he knocks theres no answer
he pulls out his phone and calls her

olivers flabbergasted shes not behind the door

the bare poor bathroom is not fancy
outside my window
oliver walks and looks out her window
thats my neighbors roof
the room at the end is my bedroom
oliver enters her bedroom
thats my closet
those are my clothes and my pictures
there is a single rack holding up some clothes
her pictures are taped to the wall
oliver sits on her bed
why do you leave everyone
why did you let me go
oliver thinks for a moment
repeat memory oliver watches his mother walk down the hallway very alone and enter her bedroom it feels like some gesture of hopelessness
maybe because i i dont really believe that its gonna work
and then i make sure it doesnt work
hal lies in the hospital bed set up in his living room
juan a young handsome and probably gay hospice nurse is gently helping him take his morphine
hal looks at juan with love and affection
oliver watches from the kitchen door
isnt juans hair wonderful
i use this great mousse
well its terrific
do you wanna try some
hal turns shy and young
just a little bit
i dont think so
just try a little bit
itll be fun
how do you do it
okay im going to show you how
juan steps away and grabs his mousse puts a little in his hand and sits back down on hals bed
he begins to spread it gently through wisps of hals white hair
oliver watches hal close his eyes and deeply enjoy this simple affection and camaraderie with another gay man
is that it
hal looks into camera which is olivers pov
how do i look
olivers filled with love happiness regret
you look great
olivers still on her bed his heart and mind is somewhere else
hals unconscious on his hospital bed
some of hals friends gather around his hospital bed as hals gay priest gives him his last rites oliver and juan watch in disbelief in the background
olivers alone in the kitchen his head on the table asleep
juan walks to him and wakes him
oliver gets up
he can now see to the hospital bed hals lifeless profile
oliver is lost
oliver goes to hal puts his head on his chest and cries
once you make the call you have less than an hour before two men come and place the body into a bag
they charge dollars for cremation and deliver the remains in a small metal container the size of a jar of peanut butter
you will need to get a death certificate
you will need to make copies and send them to cancel every credit card phone account utility gym membership every insurance policy mortgage to settle their taxes
you will have all their mail forwarded to your address
you will write their obituary
you run it with a photo in the paper for two dollars a word
you will wonder if its right
youll throw a lot of their stuff away
youll bring a lot of their stuff to your house
this is the photo my mother kept in her bedroom
when i was a kid i thought that was my arm giving her daisies
now i make a new mistake and think its her arm giving me the daisies saying here heres simple and happy
thats what i meant to give you
oliver arrives at andys door
andy answers arthurs jumps up to see oliver
oliver picks him up he gets all of arthurs stuff hes a little cold to andy
its cause im gay isnt it
oliver stops and looks back
you never called or came to see me
oliver falters not know how to say it then
no its because my father loved you so much
this hits andy hard
oliver turns to leave but cant
he turns back goes to andy and they hug
oliver and arthur arrive happy and relieved oliver jumps on his bed and arthur follows
hey howve you been
oliver opens the front door to anna
shes a bit tentative but shes here and happy
come in come in
arthur runs up and anna bends down to greet him
they missed each other
anna walks in and oliver follows
the living room
she heads to the dinning room
oliver laughs nervously
in the dining room hals old boxes are still stacked along the walls
oliver leans forward and pulls something out of a box
she looks at a personal ad application with the picture of hal in the open jean jacket we saw at the beginning of the film
can i read it
im looking for sex with the hope it turns into friendship or a relationship
but i dont insist on monogamy
we see repeat shots of hal and in every shot hes looking at camera
hal telling oliver hes gay hal napping with andy and waving at oliver hal after juan put in his hair mousse looking at oliver hal showing oliver his radiation tatoo
im an old senior guy but im attractive and horny
im an art historian now retired
more repeat shots hal with andy at the l
pride picnic hal playing with arthur on his couch
and in addition to art i like houses gardens parties and walking with my jack russell
im trim gray hair blue eyes hairy cheest
i like giving and and what
oliver finishes reading for her
i like giving and getting rubdowns and then going into mutual soft stuff
they both smile
i have a nice house with food drinks friends and me
if you are willing to try an older guy lets meet and see what happens
she looks at the photo again
he didnt give up
they look at each other more vulnerable and willing than weve seen them
anna walks down the hallway oliver follows her
anna and oliver sit side by side on his bed
what happens now
i dont know
how does that work
they look at each other they smile
