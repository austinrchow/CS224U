by charlie kaufman may there is a gunshot
a crow screams
a fluttering of wings
birds eye view
we circle lazily above the forest
through a break in the trees we catch an occasional glimpse of a prostrate form on the ground
as the circling camera gets closer we see that the form is a human body
im not sorry
a bead of sweat trickles down her cheek
then a blinding flash of light obliterates her face
i am sorry
a tear wells in puffs eye and runs down his face
another blinding flash of light
i dont even know what sorry means anymore
as nathan speaks a trickle of blood drips down his face from his out of frame forehead
another blinding flash of light
its a frenetic hand held shot as lila is pulled from a police car and dragged into the precinct house
reporters shout questions
lila attempts to shield her face from view but she is handcuffed and can only manage to hunch her shoulders
a ratty interrogation room
institutional green walls
beat up file cabinets
a bit of fluorescent light spills in through the frosted glass door
lila thirties sits at the end of a long table
a reel to reel tape recorder whirs in front of her
she is smoking
three fat mean looking cops sit in shadows at the other end of the table
one of the cops eyes her lasciviously
lilas hand shakes as she brings the cigarette to her mouth
im not sorry
so i spend the rest of my life in jail
ive been in jail my whole life anyway
a jail of blood and tissue and coursing hormones
one of the cops sighs and massages the bridge of his nose
its going to be a long night
a jail called the human body
the lascivious cop smiles lasciviously at lilas reference to human body
my soul held prisoner in this reeking stench ridden bag of bones and entrails
a bag of feces and piss and fibroid cysts in my tits and precancerous moles on my sun damaged back
the lascivious cop gags then vomits on the floor
lila drags on her cigarette calmer now
at least now ill be able to blame the state not god for my incarceration
puff thirties dirty scraggly hair and beard but in a crisp business suit testifies before a congressional committee
the auditorium is filled with reporters and spectators
puff sits in front of a microphone counsel at his side
he pours himself a glass of water drinks clears his throat then speaks stentorian confident
i am sorry gentlemen sorry for all of us
yours is a complicated sad world
this is a revelation to the assembled crowd
people whisper to each other
and i never knew that
i was living a life of simplicity of purity when i was ripped out of my eden and immersed in this harshness
some would argue that the life i was living was not a human life at all
and gentlemen i dont have any clever retort
i am not a philosopher
the only thing i know is that i am sorry sorry for my expulsion from eden sorry for my lila rotting in her jail cell and sorry for nathan
rotting in his grave
nathan thirties in a white robe sits alone at a white table
everything is white except for an oozing bullet wound in nathans temple
i dont even know what sorry means anymore
when i was alive i knew maybe it was all i knew but here sorry is meaningless
love is meaningless
jealousy is meaningless
ambition is meaningless
everything that motivated my every breath while i was alive is meaningless now
beat i guess thats how i can be sure im really dead
lila watches the slowly churning tape recorder reels fixated
the cop who vomited is mopping it up
the other two are sipping coffee
my story begins when i was twelve
checks watch jesus
its got that faded memory look
twelve year old lila hurries home from school books clutched to her chest
other kids walk along the street in pairs or groups laughing and chatting
lila walks alone a worried scowl on her face
something terrible happened when i was twelve
colors are still muted
it looks to be somewhere in the early s based on the preponderance of bay city rollers posters on the wall
twelve year old lila enters the room closes the door locks it rattles the doorknob to make sure that the door is really locked
she draws the shades
she pulls some t shirts from her dresser drawer and stuffs them into the space between the bottom of the door and the floor
muffled hey no fair
drop dead eric
lila stands nervously in front of the full length mirror on her closet door
she takes a deep breath and begins to unbutton her shirt watching herself carefully in the mirror
something terrible started to happen to my body when i was twelve
my mother said because of it i would never be able to get a man so i should get used to the idea of dedicating my life to the pursuit
of knowledge or religion
lilas shirt is now unbuttoned
she pulls it open
she is wearing a training bra over the very beginning of breast buds
on the chest above the bra and on her stomach below it is hair
dark curly hair
she stares at it touches it cautiously
then she starts to cry
she crouches into a ball and weeps
the doctor said
old fashioned office
twelve year old lila sits on the examination table her shirt off
an elderly male doctor touches the hair fingers it
her mother looks on
to the mother its hormonal
nature is a funny and complex thing
it could get worse with time
young lila turns to the camera
by the time i was twenty i looked like an ape
the cop who vomited gags again
lila stares at him
her face is hard blank
she stubs out her cigarette
puff testifies before the committee
i dont think theres anyone in the world who doesnt know by now that i was raised in the wilderness by an ape
well to be fair by a man who thought himself an ape but it amounts to the same thing gentlemen does it not
this has a faded memory look also
a naked bearded dirty middle aged man and a naked dirty ten year old puff walk along like apes crouched over and dragging their knuckles
my father escaped from a new jersey mental institution in
its raining and deserted
puffs father in pajamas comes tearing around the corner
he runs crazily towards the camera waving his arms puffing out his cheeks
he had been committed the previous year after applying one too many times at our local zoo for the job of apprentice ape
puffs father passes a newspaper vending machine stops goes back and examines the headline
it reads president kennedy assassinated
puffs father looks heavenward and clutches at his temples in despair
my father saw what the human race had come to while he was
he felt something had to be done to create a better world
puffs father climbs out a second story window with a small bundle in his arms
he runs off into the night
he stole little me from my mother his ex wife and raised me with love and tenderness and respect as an ape like himself
puff looks pointedly at the congressman
apes dont assassinate their presidents gentlemen
the congressmen are shamed they look down they take notes they mumble instructions to the assistants seated behind them
an adult puff and his now older father sit on the forest floor and pick bugs off each other and eat them
until quite recently i believed myself to be an ape although i didnt know specifically what type
apes dont think in terms of type
it might be argued gentlemen that apes dont even know that they are apes
in retrospect however id say that i was a pygmy chimp
puff holds up an illustration of a pygmy chimp
several reporters run from the room a scoop
nathan talks to nobody in particular
i have to say i always hated apes
of course i dont any longer
i dont even know what hate means now
but while alive i hated apes
i blame my parents
i mean i dont blame them
i dont know what blame is really anymore but i think they influenced me in my ape hating tendencies
ten year old nathan in a bow tie and shortpanted suit walks along with his uptight british parents
they arrive at the ape pen
nathan is excited
he jumps up and down
the apes jump up and down also
look mama monkeys
clamping down on his shoulder nathan those are not monkeys
those are apes
mountain gorillas to be precise
there is a commotion off screen
two uniformed attendants drag puffs father straitjacketed and kicking and screaming like an ape past nathan and his parents
i am not a human being
i am an animal
nathan his father and the other zoo patrons look on curiously a little frightened
nathans mother chooses to ignore it
tell him harold
then by rote we must never act like apes son
for you see the ape is our closest biological relative specifically the pygmy chimp
holds up the same illustration of a pygmy chimp that puff showed the congressional committee a single chromosome separates us
but you know what truly separates us from the apes what makes us better than apes
if we do not have these as humans then we might as well be living in pens and throwing our feces about masturbating in public
beat a reverie sniffing red swollen female rump
lila lights a new cigarette with her spent one
oh i had sexual urges
i had the urge to merge officers
inside i was grade a female
laughs derisively but what self loathing i felt
who would have someone as repulsive as unladylike as me
i did everything i could to shield the world from this repulsiveness
stockings hang over the shower curtain rod
the window shade is drawn
towels are stuffed in the space under the door
a twenty year old naked lila is covered with shaving cream face to feet
she is shaving
there is a pounding on the door
lila what are you doing in there
i need to get ready for my date
ill be out in a minute
the door opens
look ill just
stops in her tracks when she sees lila what the
lila is mortified
lila is sitting in her bathrobe on her bed and staring out the window
there is a bit of shaving cream behind her ear
her roommate runs back and forth getting ready for her date
i dont know why you didnt tell me about this
its embarrassing okay
its not so bad
beat so it just keeps growing
well dont jump down my throat
im just trying to help
how is that helping natalie
look if youre going to be like that
you should be appreciative that im interested
why because im a freak and you are beautiful and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles
pegged youre fucked up lila
out the door why dont you fucking try electrolysis or something
figure it out for chrissake
the door slams
lila hugs her knees to her chest
at sixty dollars an hour electrolysis was not a feasible solution
i explored my alternatives
twelve year old lila walks sadly through an art museum
she looks at various old portraits of men
she studies their facial hair
when she turns a corner she is shocked to see a large renaissance painting of a naked woman entirely covered with fur
she hurries to it
she looks at the placard next to the painting
it is a painting of mary magdalene
i remember once coming across a painting of mary magdalene entirely covered with fur
i guess thats where i got the idea that maybe the catholic church might be a place that encouraged excessive hair growth in its women
lila in a nuns habit is on her knees praying
so i became a nun
sighs please let this hair go away
but my prayers were always so selfish
a bunch of naked women dance and chat around a campfire
lila is there pretty hairy
so are many of the other women
i tried being a lesbian separatist
chanting a woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle
but i guess i just wasnt attracted to women even hostile man hating hairy ones who wore sensible shoes
lila in a full beard sits on a throne before a crowd of gawking dumb looking mouth breathing children
next to her on a separate stage is a sour looking middle aged midget man sitting on a throne staring blankly into space
for a while i was a professional circus freak
lila in a santa suit with beard sprayed white sits on a throne in front of a crowd of gawking dumb looking mouth breathing children
one of them is on her lap
next to her sits the sour midget dressed in an elf suit
during the holiday season they made us wear costumes
depressed ho ho ho
thats not real
the kid pulls lilas beard
you little fuck
aside from the great dental this occupation was not pleasant
lila walks home
shes wrapped in winter clothing but we can still see a bit of her white beard
the street is deserted
she spots a lighted window she peers in
its a warm family scene
large group of chatting laughing people
fire in the fireplace
big turkey on the table
they say the holidays are difficult for a lot of people
lila looks down the street and sees dozens of lonely looking people peering forlornly in warmly lit windows
some on ladders to peer in second floor windows
the room is lit with candles
lila finishes shaving herself all over
then she takes the double edged blade out of the razor and climbs into the a bathtub filled with warm water
she is about to slice her wrists
i decided there was something poetic about killing myself with a razor blade
on the shelf next to the tub a little gray mouse watches her intently
at first she is startled but then she and the creature seem to be communing
his little black beady eyes reflect the light
lila starts to cry
she puts down the blade
lila wipes a tear from her eye
the way that mouse looked at me
there was no judgement
it didnt care if i had hair all over my body
i was just what i was
i felt so free
do you understand what im saying
the cops look up on the spot
it seems their minds were elsewhere
something about a mouse right
we see a tent in a clearing
a smoking campfire
there is a rustling inside the tent
lila steps out naked
she is covered with fur
she pours a cup of coffee and stands comfortable in her skin watching the world around her
squirrels jump from tree to tree birds look down at her
birds and squirrels and rocks and trees didnt seem to judge my hair
i felt at peace when there were no humans around
i figured out a way to spend as much time as possible with no people around
i became a nature writer
lila picks up a pad and pen from a rock sits on the rock and writes
a woman under a hair drier reads a book intently
we see the first sentence of the chapter last night i almost died on this mountain top
we hear lilas dramatic reading competing with the very loud sound of the hair drier
last night i almost died on this mountain top and the irony is i had never felt more alive
there is a violent violent storm
the hair drier drone has turned into the explosive noise of rain beating down in sheets and wind howling at fifty miles an hour
lilas tent blows over revealing her huddled there with a sleeping bag wrapped around her like a blanket
i knew it was coming when in late afternoon a thunderhead drifted over sneaking in like kids through the back door of a movie theater forced casual
it turned the sky a queer shade of green
a green that said watch out baby this is gonna hurt like hell
i couldve hightailed but that would be cheating
part of the nature experience is recognizing its mastery over you your smallness in the face of it
lightning hits a tree nearby
it falls with a smack practically on top of lila
she screams then defiantly stands throwing off the sleeping bag
the wind and rain whip her hair around her head
she laughs with amazing gusto and raise her arms like a runner winning a marathon
as nietzsche said what does not kill me makes me stronger and that goes double if youre a woman
we see many copies of a book entitled wind in my hair by lila jute
i became a successful nature writer
we see a woman under a hair drier reading wind in my hair
we pull back to see that a long row of women under hair driers are reading lilas book
they all stand defiantly proudly knocking their hair driers up and back as they do
the blowing hair driers whip the womens wet hair around their heads
the blowing hair drier drone is unbearably loud
then i became a famous nature writer
i said to myself fuck humanity
a big display of the book fuck humanity by lila jute
a long line of women with beautifully coiffured hair snakes out of the store
and i became a recluse
i had a menagerie of animals at my house
they loved me because i was me
they loved me on the days i shaved
they loved me on the days i didnt
for a while this was enough
lila lies in bed tapping on a lap top
a dog lies with her and licks her knee
she seems to enjoy it and gets lost in a reverie
the dog morphs into a handsome man kissing her knee and working his way up her thigh and under her nightgown
lila is getting seriously hot and bothered
her head lolls
but the reverie dissipates and the man turns back into a dog rooting around her crotch with his cold nose
she pushes him away
the dejected dog gets off the bed
by the time i was thirty i was very very horny
lila gets out of bed and studies herself in the mirror
she brushes her hands against her hairy body
i had to have a man in my
at any cost
i would become what i needed to become to achieve this
i would become a hairless lie
the mirror image of lila shimmers and turns into lila with no body hair
lila all made up and with a smart new hairstyle
she assumes a coquettish pose and smiles cutely at herself
i was rich enough for electrolysis by this time so i began the long arduous process of having each inappropriate hair burned out of my body at the root
one of the cops is doodling
one is picking wax from his ear with a pencil
one is reading a paperback novel under the table
this is when everything changed and this is where my confession really begins
the cops look up
lila lies shirtless on a table while rose her fifty year old electrologist works on her back
oh yes honey
getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over
smooth as a babys butt
i love it rose
im getting to be a real girl
you still in the market for a real boy
beat cause theres this guy
my brother knows him
might be right up your alley
i could use someone up my alley
playing dumb i dont get that
is that sexual
shut up and tell me
handsome thirties psychologist
must love animals rose
what do you mean
somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine
handsome animal loving psychologist said he would love to meet you
your brother didnt tell him about the nature of our relationship did he
my brother is discreet
rubbing her hand over her jaw wont he be able to tell
my brother says the guys a thirty five year old virgin so maybe he wont know how women usually feel
plus hes got bad eyesight almost legally blind which is helpful in this situation
plus hes got an extremely small penis of which he is mortifyingly ashamed so chances are hell be so grateful for any non judgmental attention that hell be yours forever
god he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff
yeah well my brother is his shrink
its a chi chi place
lila sits at a table with nathan fastidious in dress and manner
there is an awkward firstdate silence
she sneaks a glance at his crotch
then meditations on a banana slug was a delightful read
thank you so much
i love slugs
all slugs not just banana slugs
as do i
theyre so even keel
they forge ahead with slow determination
they dont get distracted or side tracked
they dont care what they look like
they dont care that people look at them and go ewww
they dont seem to be especially ego driven this is true
youve got to respect that
i have to say that im not there yet
whatever youd call it
im not there yet
i still have many human characteristics
thats not necessarily a bad thing
i suppose not
one would like to move along
to move beyond
im not sure we can escape our natures
believe me ive tried
im not even so sure anymore that we should want to
i love that you said that
it makes me feel a bit lighter
ive been rather heavy lately
thinking about my childhood
realizing how much a product i am of my upbringing
beat cautiously ive been seeing someone
feigning surprise you are a therapist right
im a psychologist but i do research
im a behaviorist
i work with animals
mice at the moment
i hope you dont perform any of those dreadful torture experiments nathan
my work now is
right now im teaching mice
well table manners to be candid
doesnt know what to say hows it going
quite well really
its a lot of work
a lot of reinforcement mostly positive
right now ive gotten two of my subjects to use napkins
tiny napkins of course
paper or cloth
i hope you dont think me daft
its important work
its part of a larger sociological experiment
im federally funded
whats the larger experiment
its my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice they can be taught to humans
going out on a limb arent you nathan
speech the truth is most people dont have table manners today
and when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels
im not sure
stridently courtesy decorum manners are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse
rudeness vulgarity meanness are the norm
we are animals after all
ergo if i can teach table manners to mice i can teach them to humans
if i can teach table manners to humans i can save the world
lila stares at him for a long moment
her thoughts are unreadable
lila lies on her back
rose works on her breasts
i really like him rose
searching passionate about his work
my brother says he likes you too
says he likes you even more than he likes his own mother
and according to my brother nathans abormally close with his mother
i began going to a therapist when i was in my thirties because i felt that i wasnt enjoying life the way my friends were
beat after a time my childhood came up
it is another sepia scene
nathan as a ten year old sits at the table with his parents
there is a bowl of salad in front of each of them
everyones head is bowed in prayer
lord we thank you for this bountiful gift we are about to receive
eyes open and young nathan reaches for a fork to eat the salad
he grabs the wrong fork
mothers eyes widen in horror
my god no
disappointed oh nathan
nathan looks up
that is the wrong fork young man
to father harold tell the boy
that is the wrong fork young man
panicky ill use the right one
harold tell the boy more
go to your room
tell the boy again
looking at mother no buts
go to your room now
looking at father and
and think about what youve done
adult nathan sits on the couch dabbing at his eyes
wendall his therapist sits across from him and writes something in his notebook
and do you think maybe this early childhood indoctrination has something to do with your interest in table manners in the present
nathan thinks long and hard about this
he seems to be really straining squinting his eyes
finally i dont think so
wendall nods and scribbles something on his pad
why do you ask
wendall looks up
people in lab coats hustle back and forth
nathan also in a lab coat is hovering over a lucite encasement
inside we see two white mice both attached to electrodes
they sit in little chairs at a little table
in front of each of them is a little plate of salad and three forks of varying size under lucite domes
nathan nods to his pretty french assistant gabrielle who presses a button
the lucite domes over the salads lift
tentatively both mice reach for a fork
there is a tiny piece of velcro on each mouses paw and a tiny piece of velcro on each of the forks
the first mouse picks the correct fork and stabs it into the salad and eats happily relieved
the second mouse picks the wrong fork
nathan presses a button which sends the mouse flying off his chair with an electric shock
the correct mouse keeps eating unconcerned
nathan makes a note in his notebook
gabrielle watches nathan as he writes enchanted
the table is elegantly set candlelit
lila sits at it while nathan fusses in the kitchenette
something classical wafts over from the stereo in the living room
nathan places a salad in front of lila and sits across from her with his own salad
it looks wonderful
you look wonderful
im on top of the world tonight lila
work is going splendidly and my personal life is
lila picks up a fork from the inside of her setting not the outside
lila tastes the salad
oh nathan this salad is delish
clenched teeth my god
strangely tell her harold
stops himself its just that
its just that the outside fork is the salad fork
one goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses
oh im sorry
picks up correct fork im sorry nathan
i never really learned those things
forced casual no biggie
there is a long silence as they both eat the salad
boy this is good
im sorry that i became so upset
no im sorry
im really backward in certain areas
beat blurting its only that i really enjoy your company and
you really enjoy my company
beat blurting please dont talk with food in your mouth lila
youre so pretty and it only mars your
im being critical
nathan pounds his forehead with his fist
lila waves her hand to indicate that its fine
she doesnt say anything because shes chewing
its just that i have some peculiarities and
i like you too nathan
yeah beat but i have some peculiarities also
happily i dont care
i dont care
then concerned like what for example
lila takes a deep breath about to go into it thinks better of it
nathan smiles relieved
lila smiles back
nathan recoils slightly skittishly half points to his bared teeth
apparently theres a piece of food stuck in lilas teeth
she closes her mouth runs her tongue over her teeth smiles again mouth closed
rose is doing lilas feet
my brother says things are going really well between you and nathan
i cannot believe how in love i am with this man
hes so cute
i even like his cute little penis
its like a little pigs penis or something
beat rose we connect on every level
ive finally found someone i can feel completely safe with
dont throw that away
i had that once with a guy
but i threw it away for a cheap thrill
one night stand
i married a midget
marrying a midget was a cheap thrill
well he wasnt really a midget
he was on the cusp of midgethood
thats what made it cheap
had he been an actual midget there wouldve been nothing cheap about it my dear
i didnt know you were into that sort of thing
let me tell you honey midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship
and theyre exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor
screams with delight then i have a friend you might like to meet
three foot one
be still my crotch
rose nathans no midget but hes asked me to move in with him
my brother told me
and i think im going to
mulling it over stand on a stepladder sometimes
lila moved in with me
did i love her
i thought so
but from my new vantage point i realize that love is nothing more than a messy conglomeration of need desperation fear of death insecurity about penis size and the self
involved ego driven need to collect other peoples hearts
not that i judge it
puts head in hands
looks up listen i dont want to be dead yet
is there any way to
nathan looks around for some sign of another person
there is nobody
no i suppose not
beat no biggie
anyway lila moved in
we had our problems but we both wanted love so badly we turned a blind eye
nathan lila and nathans parents looking very very old sit at the dining room table
salad is about to be eaten and everyone glances sideways over at lila waiting for her to make her move
she reaches for the wrong fork corrects herself and picks the salad fork
nathan breathes a sigh of relief
his mother looks disappointed clucks
they eat in silence
finally its lovely to finally meet you mr
ive heard so much about you and ive seen you in photographs from nathans childhood but its nice to meet you in the flesh
i must say you look exactly the same as in the photographs
thank you dear
actually mother and father you look very very old
you look terrible
his mother and father touch their faces reflexively then look at each other and laugh
tell him harold
son your mother and i are doing a production of the gin game at the local community theater
we forgot to take off our make up
the mother and father laugh again
then they pull at their latex faces
the wrinkles come off
and they look exactly as they did in the flashback scene albeit a bit pink faced
there is another pause
awkward goodness you two look exactly as you did in those old photos
cold yes so you mentioned earlier dear
changing the subject lilas a nature writer mother
i love nature
as long as it stays in the zoo where it belongs
the father and nathan laugh at mothers joke
lila joins in weakly against her better judgment
to lila dont you agree dear
of course she does mother
nathan is in bed in starched pajamas
he lies on his back under perfect covers and stares straight up at the ceiling
what are you doing in there
pissy ill be out in a minute
im sorry about my parents
you didnt seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mothers stupid tasteless cruel animal jokes
i was simply attempting to keep the evening light
you know that i feel similarly to you about nature
beat i simply love the
naturalness of it all
lila emerges from the bathroom radiant hopeful
oh do you darling
lila happily leaps into bed
she smothers nathan with kisses
im so relieved
lets celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow
oh shit thats a great idea
nathan kisses her
itll be wonderful
ill show you my old stomping grounds
nathan kisses her ear
he looks confused sticks his finger behind her ear and pulls it out with a dab of shaving cream on it
i dont think so
hes dressed in spanking new freshly starched safari clothes big shiny new hiking boots
lila sits in the front passenger seat
she is dressed in a costume identical to nathans but as opposed to nathan she seems awkward in it
she fidgets in it straightens it sighs comes to terms with it and looks dreamily out the window at the passing trees
she is home
thats all that matters
darling did you bring the insect repellent lotion
beat oh and the sun block
what spf sweetie
we are ready
beat say wouldnt it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block
think of all the time one would save
i think ill get johannsen in chemistry on that
did you bring the first aid kit
we could call it quit bugging me sunny
laughs a lot get it
s u n n y
laughs appreciatively thats very funny
i love you so much
then gentlemen one day i saw something i hadnt seen since my father died in a freak accident involving a rotted log and four thousand bees stinging his head
i saw other human beings
they chattered away at each other in what appeared to be gibberish
later i learned it was english
now i wonder if perhaps my initial assessment hadnt been correct
puffs pov through some brush we watch nathan and lila hiking
we hear puffs loud heavy breathing and in the distance the relentless gibberish chatter of nathan and lila
lila glances over
it was a flash of white
i ruled out deer immediately
were with lila and nathan now
lila has stopped and is peering into the distance
did you see that
i dont know
mightve been a person
nervously it might behoove us to turn back at this point
lila walks in the direction of the sighting
not budging if its a person why should we go see it
its not like its nature or anything
its just a person
beat sometimes people who live in the woods dont want to be seen
they live in the woods because theyre anti social lila
we have to respect that
lila trudges through the brush
better than being left behind
this is the way to get ticks lila
this is it
youve hit the nail on the head here
lila is in her element
her whole demeanor has changed
she is tracking
she sniffs the breeze cocks her head moves stealthily
then she sheds her clothes almost shaking them off like a dog shaking off some cute costume his owner had dressed him in
oh for gods sa
lila turns her head and glares at nathan
there is an animal fierceness in her eye that shuts him up instantly
she turns back to pursue her prey
i had never seen anything like it
puffs pov we see a naked lila looking in our general direction but not seeing us
the sun dapples her body
she moves closer and closer
it was an ape as i had never seen before
like me yet different in certain essential details
and all at once i felt a heat pass through me
my heart raced
gentlemen i wanted to touch her to caress her to be one with her
i had urges and desires i could not explain
i felt overwhelmed by the power this strange creature had over me and so i did what any animal would do when it comes across an animal of superior strength
the cops are transfixed
we are with lila
she creeps along when suddenly a tan muscular figure tears out from behind a tree and runs practically on all fours through the dense underbrush
lila follows almost as agile as the forest creature
nathan just stands there
the chase continues
there is a great deal of heaving and panting
puff shimmies up a large tree
puff leaps from branch to branch
lila follows easily
puff swings from a vine
so does lila
finally they come to the end of the trees a clearing
there is no nowhere for puff to leap
lila is with him in the tree
they are crouched bloody heaving on separate branches staring at each other
after a long moment lila speaks
who are you
puff cocks his head
the high timbre of her voice surprises him pleases him but he doesnt understand the words
you dont understand my language do you
puff looks at his crotch
apparently there is some activity down there
lila following his eyes glances down there also
laughing i take it back you do understand my language
puff grabs for his crotch and begins to play with himself distractedly looking at her all the while
he falls out of the tree
branches crack and snap as he passes through them and then there is an unpleasant thud when he hits the forest floor
lila shimmies down the tree and kneels by puff
he is unconscious
nathan comes limping through the brush
somehow his safari suit and boots are as clean and pressed as they were in the car
he is carrying lilas clothes
somehow he has had time to neatly fold them
oh my god
is he dead
please put something on
lila looks up at icily at nathan
youll catch cold
beat what do you suppose he is a survivalist
i think hes feral
jumping back feral
dont touch him
he might be diseased
my god rabies
he looks perfectly fine
i think we should go
before he wakes up and i dont know eats us or whatever feral things do
i dont understand you
this is fascinating and you just want to run away
i mean here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization totally free and all you want to do is run back to your
thinking actually i just had an amusing thought
musing feral huh
look at him
he doesnt understand english
he moves like an animal
nathan what the hell are you talking about
doing a little dance forget mice
actually forget guinea pigs cats monkeys and chimps also
im on to stage five the human subject
you cant take him from his home nathan
ranting dont you see
hes my tabula rasa my eliza dolittle
hes my ticket to the top of the behaviorist food chain
hes going to make me famous
i wont allow you
hes happy here
is he lila
is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness
never to know the love of a good woman never to revel in the pitter patter of little feet never to read moby dick or marvel at a monet or
just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work smoke a pipe and wonder about the nature of reality
weakening resolve youd be taking away his freedom nathan
freedoms just another word for nothing left to lose lila to quote janet jackson
lila looks off into the distance her eyes brimming with tears
as nathan continues his speech we move closer and closer into lilas eyes
nathans voice fades into nothing by the time we dissolve
belonging to something a person or a society is a basic human craving
we are communal creatures
this poor soul has no one nothing
a naked very hairy lila sits by herself on the cliff and watches the sunset
theres a chill in the air and she shivers and hugs herself
oh god i have no one
you give me this beautiful gift this glorious sunset
but with no one to say isnt that a beautiful sunset to it becomes meaningless just another stupid sunset
they happen everyday
lila is hovering over the unconscious puff
nathans voice comes back into focus
he is still speechifying
what is it that makes us human if not the knowledge that we are indeed human
think of this poor souls education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon
grab his feet
well throw him in the trunk
nathan hovers over the lucite case with the tiny dinner table in it
his assistant gabrielle presses a button a door opens and two white mice scurry in
the male pulls out a chair for the female
the female climbs up on the chair and the male pushes the chair in then scurries around to the other side of the table and climbs onto his own chair
the lucite lid over the silverware and salads lifts and both mice pick up the proper forks and begin eating
nathan scribbles in his notebook
nathan looks up
gabrielle jerks her head in the direction of a very large lucite case
inside puff now dressed in a diaper and connected to all sorts of electrodes is stirring
nathan and gabrielle hurry over
puff groggily takes in his surroundings
this is quite a lot to take in
the white room the strange apes in strange suits his own clothing the wires
after surveying the scene for a moment puff becomes frightened and agitated
he tries to escape
not understanding lucite he smashes into it again and again
he tears at his diaper
nathan gives a nod to gabrielle who presses a button on a panel
an electric shock sends puff flying
he lies on the floor confused and dazed
after a moment he gets up and again crashes into the lucite
nathan gives the signal to gabrielle and once again she shocks puff
he once again gets up and crashes against the lucite
again he is shocked
he gets up again and is about to crash against the lucite but he thinks better of it and squats in place immobilized
to gabrielle only three shocks
a chimp takes fifteen
this is going to be tres simple no gabrielle
in love with nathan oui doctor oui
to puff good morning
to gabrielle we need a name for him dont we
today is your day
well i had a sweet little mongrel puppie named puff when i was a girl
this one reminds me of my dog all shaggy
giggles girlishly i loved my doggie very much monsieur
charmed puff it is then
is that okay
to puff good morning puff bronfman
bronfman and this is my assistant gabrielle
were your mommy and daddy while you are here
gabrielle likes this concept a great deal
she smiles and moves closer to nathan
to puff how about some salad son
gabrielle poises her finger above the button
she winks at nathan
nathan carrying a brief case is walking to his car
gabrielle hurries to catch up to him
her high heels click on the pavement
oh hi gabrielle
out of breath hi
i just wanted to tell you that i very much enjoy working with you
blushes now im embarrassed that i say this
they walk along
i really enjoy hearing that
youre a terrific assistant

i should not have asked such a stupid question
i know you are a very important man and
dont be silly
i am a foolish little thing
i am pink in my face no
it is only that i have been so lonely lately and
i am ashamed
ill see you tomorrow okay

nathan is charmed
nathan and gabrielle sit at a romantic little table in a trendy coffee shop
thank you so much for accompanying me
not at all
i have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man
but im talking too much again no
of course not
youre so sweet
oh why are there not more men out there like you
gabrielle starts to cry softly
nathan doesnt know what to do
his eyes dart around then there there
gabrielle looks up at him appreciatively
you know just the right thing to say
she reaches across the table and touches his hand lightly for a moment
listen youre the best assistant ive ever had
smiles i like it when you say my name
is that stupid
nathan in his pajamas lies in bed reading
he looks up
what are you doing in there
be right out
the phone rings
nathan picks it up
beat happily oh hi
nathan sits up in bed
who is it
who is it
into phone absolutely gabrielle
covering phone testily someone from work
into phone sorry about that gabrielle
who from work
into phone excuse me one second would you gabrielle
nathan puts down the phone and heads to the bathroom
who is it nathan
nathan opens the bathroom door
look lila when im on a work
lila turns with a gasp
she has shaving cream all over her chest
nathan looks stunned
he backs away
the lights are low
the room is peppered with lit candles
gabrielle in a slip lies on her bed eating cherries from a bowl and listening to nathan and lilas conversation on speaker
its hormonal nathan
i cant help it
your entire body
im getting electrolysis
its working but it takes time
so meanwhile i have to
you have to shave
like an ape
crying apes dont shave you son of a bitch
you know what i mean
please dont be mad at me for this
im the same person i was before you knew damn it
i have to think
i have to think
footsteps and a door slam
lila is near the phone now and crying in desperate heaves
oh god why
rustling sound then into phone hello
is anyone there
gabrielle calmly pops another cherry in her mouth and hangs up the phone
nathan in his pajamas drives
his face is set in a furious scowl and he drives fast
gabrielle drives leisurely
she is calm a slight smile on her face
nathan paces in front of puffs lucite case
puff watches suspiciously from the corner where he is huddled
the lights are off
but there is a green glow from a couple of exit signs
i dont get it
i dont get it
i dont get it
how could i find myself in this mess
this is a mess
this is not a situation i understand
this is a mess
how do i extricate myself from this mess
is my girlfriend a man
i dont understand
this is not part of any plan
she deceived me
she has hair
beat but am i being fair
so what if she has hair
who am i to judge
i have hair
beat but im supposed to have hair
i am a man
men are supposed to have hair
beat but poor lila
think of what shes had to go through
the courage shes had to have in the face of this abomination of nature
i should love her all the more
i should love every hair on her body
i mean she doesnt mind that i have a mortifyingly small
the lights flick on
nathan turns with a start
shes in an overcoat
i did not know
im sorry to disturb you
i just came for some papers i left
no im sorry if i startled you
i came to think
beat remembering god did i hang up on you
perhaps i called at a bad time
i am sorry
i just got distracted
im so sorry
is everything fine
laughs now youve got me talking french
laughs i was in my p
s when i remembered i left some papers i need to go over
opens overcoat to reveal lingerie see
i rushed right out of the house
i must look a mess
im so embarrassed
taken im in my p
puff is taken also
his eyes are wide
beat and how is our son
laughs out of control he seems fine
i guess we woke him
the lights and all
i should turn them off
she does maybe i sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when i was a little girl
a little giddy when you were a little french girl
back in control that would be good
gabrielle kneels by puffs case
puff crawls over tries to touch her through the lucite
gabrielle sings a french lullaby
its very sweet
nathan watches her looks at her thigh her hair the delicate way the tip of her nose moves when she sings
puff gets drowsy
he curls up on the floor and sleeps
quietly to nathan there
nathan stares at her transfixed
she pretends not to notice
shall we close up then
maybe we should just sit for a while
its very peaceful
its nice yes
im glad i ran into you both in our silly pajamas
it is two happy coincidences no
yet you look so sad
a great man like you should not be sad
life is funny thats all
she stretches languorously revealing a lot of leg
i am sleepy
i shouldnt say this but youre pretty gabrielle
its unprofessional i know
i always think myself so ugly
no not ugly but plain
buying her line really
not at all
youre a very pretty girl
you should know that
you should be confident
thank you so much
its very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment
i wouldnt lie
you are sweet
gabrielle walks slowly by nathan
he inhales deeply breathing her in
she smiles to herself
he reaches out touches her leg
vaguely protesting doctor
she moves into nathan
she presses her thigh against his shoulder
nathan leans forward kisses her exposed thigh
back to reality im sorry
lila is shaving herself all over
shaving and weeping
there are nicks all over her body
she has no eyebrows any more
the hair on her head is hacked off
nathan and gabrielle are lying naked on the floor
gabrielle rests her head on nathans chest
was that okay
i mean was i able to
you are an animal
thats thats terrific to hear from someone so
feminine so female
i love being female because it how do you say allows me to be close to men
im glad youre female
beat do you think our boy witnessed the primal scene
anyway its time he grew up
nest ce pa
sighing running her fingers along his chest i love chest hair on a man
i know it isnt fashionable now hairy men
but to me it is the very sign of masculinity
gabrielle looks up innocently at him
what is wrong my darling
nothing my darling
all is right with the world
puff watches from his case
gabrielle smiles to herself
i saw it gentlemen
i saw the whole sweaty passionate ugly beautiful act and to use the vernacular i wanted me some of that
the congressmen laugh appreciatively
the laughter is a little too enthusiastic and goes on a little too long
it stops abruptly
and i think i understood from that moment that in order to get some i would have to do what they said
in order to experience this primal basic animal thing i would first have to become a civilized prissy uptight human
i would have to become nathan
the congressmen nod sadly in recognition of this reality
puff in his lucite case sits behind a set dinner table
he seems attentive calm interested as nathan teaches him table manners
gabrielle stands very close almost possessively close to nathan
she wears a lab coat but it is unbuttoned and underneath she is wearing a skin tight black minidress
she strokes the back of nathans head as he works with puff
talking to an idiot excellent puff
now the lady youre with excuses herself to go powder her nose
the wheels turn in puffs head
he thinks hard
then he stands
gabrielle shrieks and claps happily
nathan leans over and kisses gabrielle
he makes an exaggerated kissy face pursing his lips trying to imitate nathan
the phone rings
gabrielle pulls herself away giggles as nathan tries to keep her from going and picks up the phone
still giggling dr
one moment please
puts it on hold lila
takes phone hi honey
lila sits on the couch
eyebrows are attractively drawn onto her face
she wears a very femme blonde wing
lots of make up
so hows it going today
honey can we talk tonight
you know about stuff
things have been so strained for the past three weeks since you know and i just want to talk
nathan phone cradled between shoulder and ear puts his face in his hand
gabrielle rests a hand on his shoulder
everythings fine honey
we dont need to talk
besides i have to work late
i really need this
youve been working late a lot
nathan looks up helplessly at gabrielle
okay well have dinner tonight
gabrielle gets mad exhales sharply pulls her hand away
nathan gives her a pleading look grabs for her
she moves away
be home around seven
hangs up what
what was i supposed to do
disgusted i dont know nathan
what are you supposed to do
you dont abandon somebody because they have a physical problem
i thought thats exactly what you did
you just dont have the courage to admit it to yourself
a tear runs down his face mingles with the blood
i still feel guilt
one wouldve hoped
you know i really did love lila
but with her
and then when gabrielle revealed her feelings
and gabrielle was so
and she had an accent
i was lost from that moment on
but gabrielle was right
i couldnt admit it to myself this shallowness of character let alone to lila
lila and nathan eat
lila is in her new very feminine make up wig and dress
her table manners are impeccable almost robotic
there is an awkward silence are you seeing somebody else nathan
i just have to know
of course not
it would just be helpful to know
because you know you seem so distant
and you work late every night
and we hardly ever have sex and when we do its
i dont know
it feels different
im just preoccupied
do you like my new look
its really good
im trying you know
starting to cry im trying to be what you want
i want to be what you want nathan
all i want is to be what you want
takes her hand its okay lila
youre what i want
you know that
youre exactly what i want
hopefully sniffing really
because im really trying you know
rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis
hard to stomach thats great
ive signed up for a ballet class
and look at my nails
a real girl
lila holds out her hands
her finger nails are polished fire engine red
its a great color for you
oh nathan lets have a baby
lila holds and rocks a swaddled baby
she passes it to nathan who looks at it and sees that its a baby monkey
lila looks on lovingly oblivious
nathan sits with his head in his hands
wendall listens attentively
so anyway thats the nightmare ive been having lately
do you suppose it has anything to do with lilas unusually hairy body
beat no why
well it seems that since lila broached the subject of children youve been on edge and i know you have an issue with the uh body hair
revelation oh i see
yes thats something to think about
thats very good
thats what you get the big bucks right
i just think it might be important to explore your feelings for lila
i love lila
i mean shes a wonderful person
she loves me
thats no small potatoes
i mean she really loves me
shes sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me
and shes a good person
a truly good person
how rare is that in this world eh
and how could i stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection if it can even be called that
i mean god knows im not perfect
what about my eyesight
its lousy thats what
lilas not going to leave me because of my eyesight
what about my penis
and how do you feel about gabrielle
nathan puts his head in his hands and sighs
nathan is holding flash cards up to puff
puff tentatively reads aloud from the cards
gabrielle sits nearby on a stool fish netted legs crossed arms crossed and an angry expression on her face
good eve n ing lay dees and gent elmen
puff smiles happily
nathan and puff both look over at gabrielle for her approval
none is forthcoming
isnt puff doing spectacularly honey
gabby what is it
beat nathan we have to talk you and i
not in front of the boy
gabrielle stands turns and stomps across the room
nathan follows her angry switching hips with his eyes as does puff
she exits into the hall
nathan looks at puff and shrugs
puff returns the shrug
nathan follows gabrielle into the hall
gabrielle stands there waiting a troubled look on her face her eyes brimming
nathan emerges tries to embrace her
my little french
pushing him away stop
what is it
you have to choose nathan
its like sophies choice
only it is nathans choice
did you ever see that movie sophies choice
it is like that
only it is this
gabby you know im trying to sort things out
it is now that you must decide
soft i love you doctor nathan
hard but i will not wait
i will not be your chippy
i will not be your little mademoiselle parlez vous side dish
soft my love
i want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly
nathan gets a faraway look in his eyes
nathan and gabrielle sit on a blanket on this otherwise empty beach
there is a light breeze
gabrielle has one of her breasts exposed and is nursing an infant
nathan looks at the babys face
it is angelic
he looks up and smiles at gabrielle
she smiles back
nathan snaps out of his reverie looks pleadingly at the waiting gabrielle
i love you so much gabrielle
there is a but nathan
but i dont know how to leave lila
gabrielle tears off her lab coat
underneath she is wearing practically nothing a skimpy black dress
she throws the lab coat at nathan turns and storms down the hall
nathan watches until she disappears around the corner
quietly now theres a butt nathan
he brings the lab coat up to his face and breathes in her fragrance
lila all prettied up and civilized and manicured is setting the table for dinner
she is humming
nathan walks in the door
lila doesnt hear him
he stands in the doorway for a moment watching lila from behind
his face is blank
lila catches sight of him
laughs i didnt see you there sneaky boy
runs over and kisses him youre like a boy sneaking in
so bored the back door of a movie theater
you remember that from my book
kisses him again whats wrong
gonna have a drink
ill make it
beats him to the portable bar im so happy nathan
everythings going to be so great
scotch on the rocks right
giggles just kidding
i know what you drink mister
i know what you drink
pours and blends and shakes etc
lila hands nathan a frothy pink concoction with a pineapple wedge sticking out of it
nathan stares contemplatively out the window and sips his drink
lila watches him comes up behind him puts her arms around him
nathan cringes but tries to cover it
lila feels the cringe but pretends not to have
she keeps her arms around him for a moment longer then casually removes them
fishing hows work
are you satisfied
i dont want your work to be cruddy
my assistant quit today
he was highly valuable to the project
cant you hire somebody else
lila screws up her face in concentration trying to come with a viable solution to nathans problem
i could come work for you
i know i havent been all that supportive of this project but ive come around
oh yes baby
i think that this is a wonderful project youre doing taking this poor unfortunate uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being
what a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are
and i want to help
you wont have to pay me and i was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway
who needs it
i have you and i have being a woman and i have thinking about womanly things
i love being a woman because
such as what womanly things
such as my man and how to please him
kisses him such as making wonderful dinners for my man
kisses him again leads him to the table sits him down such as looking pretty for my man
kisses him again and im writing an article on quilting for the ladies home journal
i had sold my fucking soul
i let her sell her soul
i stood by as she did it
beat at the time though i thought it might help
when she came to work with nathan she seemed different gentlemen i dont know somehow soulless
puff is in his case in formal evening wear in a makeshift opera box
there is a mannequin woman sitting next to him and a boom box pumping out beethovens fidelio
puff seems attentive refined occasionally bringing a pair of opera glasses up to his eyes pinky extended
outside the case nathan and lila look on
the opera is over
puff stands applauds yells bravo and tosses a rose in the direction of the imaginary stage
the rose hits the lucite wall and falls to the floor
nathan and lila stand and applaud puff
bravo to you puff
that was wonderful
puff smiles and performs a foppish bow almost a curtsy
he picks up the rose sniffs it dramatically savoring its scent
nathan and gabrielle are having sex
they are focused and intent although gabrielle keeps chatting
you were wonderful today darling
such authority with the ape man boy
it made me so hot for you
the way you are taming him it sends chills down my girlish spine and
everywhere else too
take me darling
tame your little monkey of love
there is a mutual climax
a moment of silence then a spent nathan rolls off onto his side of the bed
we see that it is really lila in bed with him not gabrielle
sighing well im tamed dr
nathan stares up at the ceiling
we see a montage of interactions between nathan puff and lila
nathan demonstrates the proper way to taste wine sniffing the cork swishing the wine around in the glass sipping nodding in the affirmative to the waiter
puff inside his case imitates it perfectly
nathan shows puff a flashcard which reads ill start tonight with the foie gras
puff is holding up a small hand mirror and trimming nose hairs
puff juggles three balls while riding a unicycle
puff dressed as peter pan stands with legs spread and hands on hips
he is singing i gotta crow
puff dressed in an apron and chefs hat is tossing a salad
there are two types of vinegar to choose from
he hesitates then chooses the balsamic
nathan and lila applaud
puff in a smoking jacket and smoking a pipe is sitting in an easy chair next to a fake fire and a fake sleeping dog and reading a book of
poems by yeats
lila and nathan outside the case applaud and embrace
i think hes ready
jumping up oh boy
now puff were leaving on the electronic collar
i dont think well need to shock you but just in case
nathan unlocks the case
puff tentatively steps out into the world
he hugs nathan
its a grateful obsequious slightly pathetic hug
nathan hugs him back but hes keeping him at a distance
puff pulls himself out of the hug but still rests his hands on nathans shoulders and looks him in the eye almost like a lover
then he parts with nathan and goes over to embrace lila
she graciously receives him
after a moment in the embrace puff starts dry humping lila
lila cant get out of his clutches
nathan presses a button which shocks puff and sends him flying
puff appears disoriented then gets up off the floor brushes himself off and turns to lila with a bow of his head
my apologies madam
its okay puff
shant happen again
lila nathan and puff walk along
puff is astounded by everything he sees
he looks with wonderment at the tall buildings the cars the many different types of people
he looks like an idiot
puff lila and nathan are eating lunch
everything is very proper
puff is doing wonderfully
this is great puff
youre doing fine
im loving this
its such a treat to be out and about
what a wonderful invention a city is
the immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks the colorful street vendors
the waitress comes by
how is everything
youve got to give me the recipe
my compliments to the chef
im glad you
puff stands and grabs her and starts humping her
nathan presses a button on a small black box
puff falls to the floor
the waitress looks on sort of confused
and will that be all today
lila nathan and puff are in the back seat of the moving taxi
it shant happen again
i swear it
im just getting my sea legs you know
patting puff on the back its an animal urge puff
its nothing to be ashamed of
lila looks at nathan amends her statement
to puff you just have to control it
were not apes
thank you very much for that
puff is sitting in a chair and facing a screen
the collar is around his neck
nathan and lila stand behind him at a slide projector
i dont think this aversion therapy is really necessary doctor
i understand the problem
humor me puff
its essential that i am able to trust you to function independently in the world
i bow to your expertise in these matters
lila dims the lights and switches on the projector
an image of a pretty fully clothed woman appears on the screen
puffs eyes widen but he remains seated
youre doing fine
the slide changes to a naked woman standing in a neutral position no expression on her face
puff twitches but stays seated
the slide changes to another photo of the same woman in the same position but with a seductive smile on her face
puff clutches the arms of the chairs
youre doing very nicely puff
the slide changes to another picture of the same woman this time she is naked has her back to the camera is sticking her butt out and looking over her
shoulder at the viewer with shiny heavily lipsticked pursed lips
puff is shaking
puff leaps out of his chair screaming and lunges for the screen
nathan grabs the black box and jolts him
puff goes flying in the air and lands with a crack
he heaves for a while then leaps up and runs for the screen again
again nathan shocks him
again he lands on the floor
he heaves stands lunges for the screen again
nathan shocks him
this happens seven more times
smoke is pouring out from the collar
puff struggles to his feet
looks at the screen
puff sits down in his chair and studies his finger nails
nathan switches off the projector
excellent work puff
extra desert tonight
tomorrow the acid test
this is a hooters type establishment called chesters
the waitresses are very busty and in tight t shirts which are emblazoned with the name of the restaurant
lila nathan and puff sit at a table
puff studies his menu intently not daring to look up
lila looks around uncomfortably
a waitress approaches
how you all doin today
cheerily very well
awkwardly very well
looking down very well
what can i get for you
puff why dont you order first
looking at menu uh whats a reuben please
the waitress leans over to study the menu
her breasts are in puffs face
the what honey
oh the reuben
thats a sandwich with corned beef and sauer
thats what ill have
corned beef is a good food
lila nathan and puff walk along
puff im proud of you
you did remarkably well under difficult circumstances
puff jumps up and down excitedly
i tried so hard
i really concentrated
oh im so happy
and because you did so well we have a little surprise for you
happily extra dessert
lila nathan and puff enter
puff sees his lucite case
it has been transformed into a bachelor pad
inside is a king size bed a tv a couch coffee table shelves lined with books a small kitchenette
there is a curtain which can be drawn for privacy
puff is taken aback
puff gasps and runs into the room
he is thrilled
nathan holds up a key
free to come and go as you please
theres some mad money in the night table drawer
taking the key hugging nathan its wonderful
do you think im ready
do you really
i trust that youll make good mature decisions
i trust that youll do the proper thing
oh i will
gravely your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me
i dont want to disappoint you
remember when in doubt dont ever do what you really want to do
taking it in got it
lila and nathan sit as far as possible from each other and read books
nathan looks at his watch
puff dressed identically to nathan reads moby dick and smokes a pipe
he distractedly taps his foot stands and studies a monet print on the wall
his foot is still nervously tapping
he checks his watch
im going to go down and check on puff
see how hes holding up
stretching should i come with
you just relax
hows the book
lazily happily ummm
nathan kisses lila on the forehead
i wont be long
nathan drives with a determined look on his face
the apartment is a mess
every single light is on
gabrielle is lounging in a stained nightshirt with a dopey cartoon bear on the front
shes got some sort of pimple medication dabbed on her face
she unconsciously but ferociously bites her nails as she watches tv and talks on the phone
there is no trace of a french accent
into phone youre kidding
beat yeah no duh
i had a wild hair up my ass over that for a month
theres a knock at the door
gabrielles eyes widen
she jumps up from the couch and starts straightening
into phone call you back
hangs up assumes french accent you bastard
what do you want
i just want to talk
ripping off her nightshirt we have nothing to say
you are a rotten bastard thats what
nathan stands there leaning against the door
just one minute of your time
youve made your decision mister stinky american
now i hate you
no i dont hate you i dont even think about you
ive got some things to tell you
gabrielle is standing in front of a mirror holding different sexy outfits up to herself trying to decide
well i think it would be easier if i could talk to you in person
we hear banging and rustling and arranging coming from inside the apartment
well i think
you think too much
i need a man who doesnt think so much but acts more than he thinks
is what i need
you heard me
you make me sick when you pretend to not understand what i am saying to you
go away from here
turning away well look im sorry to have bothered you
he starts to head down the hall
beat then screaming all right already
come in if you must
the doors open you son of a bitch
nathan heads back to the apartment tries the knob
the doors open
the lights are low
the place is neat
cool jazz plays quietly in the background
candles are lit
gabrielle is nowhere to be found
nathan takes it all in
its quite seductive
in here you lousy piece of merde
nathan follows her voice
he exits into the bedroom
candles in here also
gabrielle now made up and in a satin teddy lounges in bed eating cherries from a bowl
nathan just stares
she is slightly out of breath but trying to conceal it
a film of perspiration glistens on her brow
god youre beautiful
i look a mess
you look so beautiful
come already to the point
im going to leave lila
i cant stop thinking about you
ive moved on
ive been seeing johannsen in chemistry
raging that goddamn neanderthal
im the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray sun screen
did you know that
calm dismissive thats not how he tells it
of course not that swedish thief
hes a thief of hearts
beat i love you gabrielle
just give me some time to let lila down easily
shes a really nice girl and i dont want to hurt her more than is necessary
beat you hurt me you know when you made nathans choice
does that not even matter to you you pig
gabrielle cries quietly
nathan moves closer to her
he strokes her hair
can you ever forgive me
gabrielle looks up at him
her expression is noncommittal and pouty but she grabs his arm and pulls him down on top of her
puff dressed a bit like hes a victorian dandy sits in the front row and watches a naked woman on stage dancing
a topless cocktail waitress comes by with a fresh drink for him
she takes away his empty glass
he is horribly drunk and holding himself with exaggerated rigidity an amateur drinkers attempt to look sober
lila sits on the couch still reading
she looks up
nathan kisses her on the forehead
you were gone a long time
sits down next to her yeah
puff and i got into a big philosophical discussion
hes really quite well read considering hes only been literate for a month now
hes going to make us famous lila
so hes doing okay
quiet evening enjoying his new digs
thats funny because you know i just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside
he called here when he ran out of his mad money after spending an entire evening drinking watching strippers and fucking a whore
then casually oh and what did you do tonight honey
and what did you do tonight honey
ive fallen in love with somebody else lila
pointedly and what did you do tonight honey
i fucked her
i fucked her
but thats what the hell i did
standing do you know what i gave up to be with you
i gave up my soul my beliefs
i gave up my body hair
yeah well im sorry
the human heart is a strange thing
how the hell would you know anything about the human heart
moving to her lila
lila turns around and slugs him square on the jaw hard knocking him to the floor
hows that for ladylike nathan
lila opens up the hall closet and pulls out a suitcase
lila looks pale and shaken
for two weeks i holed myself up in a motel room
i didnt even know who i was
my world had crumbled
there is nothing that makes you feel dirtier than finally deciding to sell your soul and finding no buyers
lila lies in bed watching tv
she is a mess
the room is a mess
the wig is off
theres hair sprouting on her face
the curtains are drawn
there is a knock at the door
no maid service
for gods sake cant you read the fucking do not disturb sign on the fucking doorknob
lila its rosie
beat go the fuck away rosie
please honey let me in
rose please go away
lila i want to help you
lila gets up drags herself to the door and opens it
rose stands there trying not to let it show how lousy lila looks
howd you know where i was
nathan told my brother
your brother should have his license revoked
yeah although im not going to turn him in
i like hearing the dirt
suddenly crying why didnt your brother tell you that nathan was having an affair
rose holds lila who hangs on her as she weeps
i dont know honey
i dont know
maybe he just didnt want to get involved
lets get you out of here
come stay with me until you get your strength back
cheerily free electrolysis if you want it
well get that face of yours cleared up in no time
lila mulls it over
she looks back at the hotel room
she sniffs in her snot
i gotta get myself together
i want to look good
if im gonna fuck with nathan and i am i want him to want to fuck me when i do it
this sequence is lila getting her strength back both emotional and physical
it is intercut with scenes of nathan and gabrielle taking puff on the lecture circuit
lila eating a good breakfast
lila struggling to do push ups
lila getting electrolysis on her face
lila reading nietzsche
a bearded psychologist addresses a crowd of bearded psychologists
and so without further ado i give you dr
nathan bronfman and puff
the room bursts into applause as nathan and puff walk out onstage both in tuxes
nathan stands behind a podium puff sits casually legs crossed in a chair
lets get right to it
here we have puff the day of his capture
a video of puff naked in his lucite case clawing at it shrieking like a banshee and neurotically hopping up and down is projected onto a screen behind nathan
there is a collective gasp from the audience
puff watches the video with amused detachment
the video stops
and here he is today a scant three months later
puff stands bows slightly to the audience
they burst into vigorous applause
puff why dont you say a few words to the assemblage
it would be my pleasure doctor
behind podium distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community i stand before you today a living testament to the amazing skill of dr
to say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement
bronfman took me from playing with my own feces then to crayons and then to an appreciation of the complex works of franz kline joseph beuys and marcel duchamp
from compulsive masturbation to
gabrielle waits in the wings
and so goodnight adieu until we meet again au revoir
the audience bursts into thunderous applause
gabrielle joins in
nathan and puff hurry off stage
gabrielle embraces nathan
you were wonderful
i wasnt a tad stiff
dont be silly
hugs puff and you were wonderful too
i loved the way you said au revoir
puff and gabrielle exchange a look
she discreetly pinches puffs butt smiles winks
nathan doesnt see this
he puts his arm around gabrielle
come on you two
lets go celebrate
nathan and gabrielle walk on ahead
puff tags behind watching gabrielles delightful walk
puff sits up on his bed looking dejected
he listens to the sounds of nathan and gabrielle having sex in the adjoining room
he looks at his watch gets up gets dressed
a sweaty sick looking puff watches a porno film in a little booth
he steps out into the fluorescent glare of the store
he walks out past several skulking degenerates
puff exits the bookstore walks down the street checking out the tawdry hookers
he chooses one
she leads him into a dark alley
lila in a tai chi class
lila doing jumping jacks
lila reading the art of war
lila doing stomach crunches
lila doing chin ups
lila swimming laps
lila getting more electrolysis
puff is on stage demonstrating his ballroom dancing technique
he is waltzing with gabrielle
nathan stops the music and picks up a microphone
now the tango
nathan puts a tango record on
gabrielle and puff perform expertly
the audience applauds
gabrielle nathan and puff are eating dinner
i think it went swimmingly today
you two make an excellent team
gabrielle and puff look at each other
she touches puffs knee under the table
nathan is busy eating
puff paces as he listens to sex noises from the next room
puff walks along checking out the prostitutes
he signals to one with a nonchalant jerk of his head
lila doing one handed push ups
lila rolling on the ground with a rifle
lila in boxing gloves punching a bag
lila reading the kama sutra
lila getting electrolysis
puff addresses the crowd
lila and nathan look on adoringly from the wings
to be taken from the depths of ignorance and depravity and raised to heights of culture and refinement
this is the priceless gift bestowed upon me by dr
puff leans against the wall drinking whiskey from a bottle as a prostitute down on her knees in front of him does her business
the look on his face is not one of pleasure or even release
it is a look of decay
lila does chin ups
her sweaty muscular arms glisten in the sun
lila wind sprinting
lila getting electrolysis
rose moves away from her
standing triumphantly ready
nathan and gabrielle in lab coats sit chatting with puff
puff sneaks glances at gabrielles legs and cleavage
she makes his viewing possible
off clipboard so weve got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements my wonderful men
were all going to be rich and famous
nathan kisses gabrielle
thanks to you nate
thanks to you buddy
and your diligence and intelligence and perseverance
to gabrielle and of course to you my sweet for your
applauding here here
gabrielle kisses nathan while glancing at puff
a midget in a business suit enters
its the sour looking guy from the freak show
excuse me are you dr
is that a little boy
teaching no puff
this man is a midget
in actuality they prefer to be called little people
isnt that correct my good man
this little person is actually a fully grown adult man puff believe it or not who due to a genetic anomaly is miniature but perfectly proportioned
to midget turn please
the midget turns
jotting in notebook interesting
now my diminutive friend what can i do for you
the midget pulls out a gun
you can get into that goddamn lucite bachelor pad for starters goliath
nathan gabrielle and puff look frightened
they stand and back into the case
to puff not you joyboy
puff stops in his tracks
nathan and gabrielle continue to back into the case
what is this about
we have no money on these premises
please if you are from some little person terrorist fringe group
loud and scary shut up
nathan and gabrielle hurry into the case
the midget closes and locks the door behind them
puff is frozen with fear
she looks different now
kind of sexy
she wears guerilla like black clothing and a beret over her closely hacked off hair
she also carries a gun
yeah this is lila cunt
and dont let the hirsutism fool you
i know more about being a woman and more about the black hearts of men than you in your pretty little powdered bullshit fantasy world can ever imagine
i know the darkness and cruelty of nature sweetie pie
lila you dont intend to hurt us do you
eat shit thumbtack dick
to midget thank you frank
youre the best
lila kisses the midget on the top of the head
anything for you lila
see frank and i are kindred spirits
we both know what its like to be shunned because of our appearance
we both know how easily that turns into self hatred
praise the lord and pass the ammunition
rose enters hurriedly carrying rope
she bends over and kisses frank hard on the mouth for a long moment then to lila sorry im late parking is a bitch at this place
lila looks over and sees the two trained mice in the lucite case sitting at a tiny table and very politely eating their lunch
one of the mice makes eye contact with lila
lila is naked in the bathroom and about to kill herself when she makes eye contact with the mouse on the shelf next to the tub
lila brings her focus back to the room
everyone is watching her waiting for some direction
uh tie them up rosie
if you will
frank keeps the gun on gabrielle and nathan
rose enters the case and begins to tie them up and gag them
puff is sitting in the car
the electronic collar is back around his neck
lila holds the black control box and the lucite case with the two mice in it
she stands outside the car with frank and rose
im going to miss you
and im going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me
shut up you
lila laughs and hugs her
i like you so much with or without hair
confidentially but dont spread that around
bad for business
im really glad you two found each other
frank and rose put their arms around each other
frank is exactly crotch high to rose
were soul mates
souls have nothing to do with it babe
ill be in touch
no you wont
but its okay
you have stuff you gotta do
lila tears up
so does rose
they just stand there for a moment then choked gotta go
lila hurries around the car gets in and drives off
rose and frank embrace
rose sighs contentedly
lilas car drives along
puff looks nervously out the window
lila and puff are driving in silence on a dirt road through the woods
lila pulls off the road drives to a place where the car will be camouflaged and parks
puff stays in the car
lila gets out pulls the lucite mouse case from the back seat
lila puts the case on the ground and unlatches it
the mice looks confused at first
then the male mouse pushes the door open and holds it for the female mouse who exits
the male mouse follows her and closes the door behind him
he turns to lila nods then extends his arm for the female mouse to hold on to
she does and they walk off together on their hind legs into the woods
lila sighs and turns to puff
puff gets out casually then makes a mad dash for the road
lila calmly presses the button on her black box
puff spasms and falls to the ground
puff stays on the ground breathing hard
take off your clothes
so does lila
she is covered with hair except for her face
but whereas puff is now white and soft looking lila is tan and taut and muscular
this is a reversal of the way both of them were when they first met
puff seems taken with her body
were going back to nature you and i
im going to retrain you
im going to make you free again if i have to kill you doing it
but i like being human now
lila shocks puff
he falls to the ground
i want to be the way i was before
ill show you how apey
puff and lila have built makeshift shelter out of leaves and twigs
they are sitting around a campfire naked and dirty roasting a couple of skinned squirrels on sticks
the black box rests in lilas lap
puff looks at the roasting squirrel is repulsed
talking is to be kept to a minimum
eventually when we are ready there will be none
language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves
there is no other reason
puff begins to disagree
lilas hand hovers over the button
he stops himself
confused i agree
lila shocks puff
any answer is the wrong answer
puff and lila lie seperately under blankets of moss
the breathing is heavy
both seem to be sleeping
puff opens his eyes and tries to extricate himself from the moss without making any noise
lila presses the button and puff falls in a quivering mess
whisper youll thank me eventually puff
well you wont thank me because we wont be speaking but youll sort of thank me with a special look the look a dog gives you to let you know
he loves you
what an enchanting picture you paint of our future together
lila shocks puff once again
as he spasms we puff testifies
and so commenced my reeducation gentlemen
lila taught me so much
she was a stern but fair teacher
and over time i began to remember the carefree joy of living in a pure state of being
but something else happened as well something perhaps distinctly human
i began to fall in love with lila
lila and puff are naked and collecting mushrooms and berries
time has passed
both lila and puff are dirtier and hairier
puff still wears his collar
lila bends over to pick a mushroom
puff looks at her from behind
boy you look so good from this ang
lila turns puts her finger to her lips in a gentle no talking reminder then shocks the hell out of puff
he spasms and falls on top of her knocking her to the ground
he regains his composure finds himself on top of lila
they look at each other for a moment
then they kiss
its a violent kiss
they grope each other
this is primal sex now
in the dirt
lila even presses the shock button at the right moment
puff seems to like it in this context
nathan and gabrielle are in bed making love
it is gentle romantic in good taste in direct contrast to the animal violent sex puff and lila are having
nathan pulls himself off of gabrielle and falls onto his back staring up at the ceiling
a penny for your thoughts mon cheri
i dont know
gabrielle nathan and nathans parents eat dinner
nathans parents are in clown make up
there is a long silence
nathan is still sad
gabrielle steals glances at nathans parents
finally nathan speaks
uninterested so mother and father hows godspell going
how did you know we
the parents look at each other burst out laughing
tell him harold
its going famously son famously
despondent im glad
harold ask nathan whats wrong
yes please somebody ask him what is wrong
i dont know
nathan and gabrielle are in bed
nathan stares up at the ceiling
finally i want our boy back
i worked so hard
we worked so hard you and i
he wouldve made us famous
we still have you and i
and thats great
but it would be great in a better way not a better way but a different way if i could find him and bring him back
where do we look for little lost puff
i have some thoughts
i think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape
that is horrible
apes are dirty
you better believe theyre dirty
and they dont know their forks from their assholes
nathan seemingly in the grips of a sudden horrific migraine scrunches his face and holds his ears
he relaxes a bit and gets out of bed
he walks across the room pulls on some pants and picks up a container called stop buggin me sunny
im going alone
this could be dangerous
pulling covers up and turning away from him onto her side okay my sweet
a little resistance would be nice damn it
without opening her eyes please let me go with you
nathan is driving along a wooded dirt road
hes in his immaculate safari suit
he looks tired
he stops the car pulls out a gun and gets out
nathan gets out of the car and runs into the woods
he looks around there is no one there
he sighs and walks back to his car pulls out a map and marks an area with a red x
nathan is in his underwear
he is ironing his safari suit as he talks on the phone
no luck yet my sweet
we see an unfolded map on the bed
there are red xs in almost all the state parks along the east coast
lila and puff are having sex again next to a campfire
now lila is wearing the collar and puff is giving her well timed shocks
they giggle and kiss after they finish
puff sits up
he holds his stomach and grunts hungrily
lila grunts back
she stands and retrieves a sack of berries
puff and lila greedily gluttonously stuff their faces
lila takes some berries and smashes them against puffs face
she laughs heartily
he looks annoyed for a second but then grabs a handful and squishes them against lilas face
pretty soon they are having a berry war and are covered in purple stains
they hug each other out of breath and laughing
it was paradise
beat sadly at least for a tiny little while
lila and puff lie naked in a tree lazily soaking up the midday sun
there is a rustling in the bushes
they both look up alert but calm
nathan immaculate in his safari suit appears in the clearing
he holds a gun
ive covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern ohio
oh please is that as articulate as you can be after all the time i spent teaching you
weve discussed wittgenstein for christs sake
not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject
down from the tree
both of you
keep your hands where i can see them
dont want you pulling any weapons out of your fur
nathan laughs heartily haughtily at his joke as lila and puff climb down from the tree
look at you two
you both disgust me
to puff i gave you
i created you in my image puff
i took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners
and this is how you repay me
by heading back to the ooze first chance you get
i should leave you here with lila the ape woman
it would serve you right you ungrateful piece of crap
but im not going to
youre too valuable to me
totally selfish of me
you serve my purpose
but if you had any smarts you would realize that i serve your purpose as well
life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit
dont worry lila
you can stay
i dont have any interest in you anymore
to puff cmon monkey boy
puff looks at lila
lila shrugs helplessly
puff reaches out to touch her hand
puff looks at lila again
she jerks her head in the direction of nathan
puff sighs and moves to nathan
nathan prods puff and they head off through the trees
suddenly puff elbows nathan
nathan grunts doubles over
puff turns lunges and the two wrestle on the ground
puff pries the gun from nathans hand and jumps up
nathan stands also backing away
puff has the gun trained on nathan
lila runs to puff stands behind him
puff put the gun down
lets be reasonable human beings here
were all reasonable human beings arent we
jumping up and down like a chimp unka unka unka unka unka
look why dont you and lila stay here and have your natural life
ill just go on my way
youll never see me again
to lila guiltily i have to talk
is that okay
to nathan you did create me in your image nathan
before you i was a simple happy complete being in harmony with the world around me
after you i became duplicitous cynical angry anal totally out of touch with my surroundings
in a word nathan i became you
lila has reintroduced me to myself
and incidentally what im about to do kill you is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the earth
before when i killed it was for food or in self defense
now i will kill for revenge
revenge is an abstract concept nathan
and i learned abstract thinking from you
a crow screams
the fluttering of wings
the bullet hits nathan in the head
then i shot nathan
puff dabs his eye
then lila shot nathan
then puff shot me
then i died
thats all i know
thats the end of my story
do i get to go to heaven now
beat or is it
beat i just stay here is it
i just stay here and tell it again
and after that
yes of course
sighs clears his throat we move into an extreme close up
beginning again i dont even know what sorry means anymore
when i was alive i knew maybe it was all i knew
lila runs to nathan
she kneels beside him
calmly we bury the body
we disappear into the woods
beat then quietly no
this is the end of the road
theres a dead human being here
for all of his faults he was a human being and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody
forget him lila
well never talk about it again
well never talk again period
i love you
puff what happened to you is as much my fault as nathans
maybe more so because i knew it was wrong and i went along with it anyway
im taking responsibility for the murder
i want you to go back to your old life
i wont let you do that
i shot the bastard
and im glad
go back to the woods
this is a sacrifice i need to make
in my world we have something called penance
its another abstraction but i had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent
it doesnt exist for you and it shouldnt
see i could never be free again anyway so i might as well be in jail
beat then ill live for both of us lila
ill be the most free truest animal in the whole forest
for both of us
tearing up thats what im counting on
an idea but first ill live among them just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind
if you think it will help
lila now in prison coveralls sits in a dayroom with other women convicts
she is watching a tv mounted on the wall
puff is testifying
and so gentlemen that is my story
i agreed to testify before this committee because i hoped to convey to the american public that there is indeed a paradise lost
human beings have become so enamored of their technologies and their intellectual prowess and their fancy gourmet foods that theyve forgotten to look to the earth as a teacher
this is hubris my friends
and my story of destruction and betrayal is proof of that
i will keep my promise to lila
i will shed this suit and go back into the wilderness
i will live out my days naked and free
thank you sir
your story has touched us all deeply
we will pass some legislation addressing this problem
that is all i ask
to camera good bye lila
i take you with me in my untamed heart
puff stands and exits the auditorium
in the prison common room lila wipes a tear from her eye
she seems genuinely happy
she looks out a small barred window and sees a bluebird light there then fly away
puff walks along a man on a mission
as he walks he sheds articles of clothing
he is followed by reporters and cameramen and celebrity hounds
soon he is naked
puff walks along naked
people cheer from porches
puff walks along
he is still followed by reporters
cows watch the parade
puff walks along a dirt road
he is about to disappear into the forest
an older woman rushes out from the crowd
i saw you on c span
ive been looking for you for thirty years
then there you were such a beautiful beautiful grown man
the older woman starts to cry
puff holds out his hand for her to shake
formally its a pleasure to meet you mother
but im an ape like dad was
checks watch and i have to go back into the woods now
resigned yes i suppose so
i suppose i knew that was going to be what you would say
its good to see you again though
im in the book if you ever want to drop me a line or something
im an ape mom
im an ape
and apes dont drop lines
his mother weeps
puff gently rests his hand on her shoulder for a moment then he turns and waves to the reporters
the crowd bursts into applause
puff jogs into the woods
there is a collective sigh and then everyone turns and heads back in the direction from which they came
we hold on the woods for a moment
a car pulls up
puff hurries out of the woods and jumps in the passenger side of the car
puff leans over and kisses gabrielle who is driving the car
hello my little boy
did you bring any clothes
im freezing my ass off
nathans silk suit just like you asked
putting on suit god ive wanted you forever
puff kisses her
say my name
eyes glistening you remind me so much of nathan
like father like son
stroking his face you remind me so much of nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie
this turns gabrielle on
she kisses him passionately
when the kiss runs its course puff speaks
gabrielle kisses him again even more passionately this time as much as i loved nathan im not sorry she killed him if it means i can have you
is that a terrible thing to say my sweet
putting her finger to his lips hush
no it is never terrible to be in love
nathans memory lives on in our sacred union
beat im not sorry she killed him either
nathan was wonderful
he was erudite and sophisticated and charming
you are all that too
but you have something more
you have a bit of the animal in you
they smile flirtatiously at each other
puff leans over and kisses gabrielles neck
lets go eat im starved
the car makes a screeching u turn
it disappears in the direction of the city
when the dust clears we see the two white mice standing there on the side of the road shivering and emaciated
the male holds out his the thumb and the female holds a tiny little sign which reads new york
there is a look of hopelessness in their beady black eyes
