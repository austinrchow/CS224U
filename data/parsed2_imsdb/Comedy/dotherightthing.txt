ahmad sits down with them
ella you have a brain use it
in the bg we hear the dum dum dum of a giant box
the sound gets louder as the box gets closer
the youths look down the block and see a tall young man coming towards them
he has a very distinct walk its more like a bop
this is radio raheem
the size of his box is tremendous and one has to think how does he carry something that big around with him
it must weigh a ton and it seems like the sidewalk shakes as the rap music blares out
the song we hear is the only one radio raheem plays
radio raheem stops in front of the group looks at them and turns down the volume
its quiet again
peace radio raheem
you the man radio raheem
its your world
in a big way
radio raheem nods and turns up the volume
radio raheem waves to mister senor love daddy as he walks by
mister senor love daddy gives radio raheem a clenched fist salute

da mayor lowers the can from his mouth and looks up at his heckler

da mayor changes his face into a more grotesque look

mookie turns around and goes back
doctor this is da mayor talkin
doctor always try to do the right thing

mookie is hiking up a flight of stairs
he puts the pizza box down and takes a breather
sweat drips off his face
he bends down to pick up the pizza box and tackles the last few flights
mookie pushes the buzzer
a young puerto rican woman opens the door
i hope its not cold
mookie hands her the pizza
no its not cold
twelve dollars for the pie
nilda hands him a handful of singles
mookie looks at the crumpled mess
nilda attempts to close the door but mookies foot says hell no
let me count this first
first he straightens out the dollars then counts the bills
i counted the twelve dollars myself
twelve is right but no tip
i carried your pizza up five flights of stairs and shit
the cheese didnt slide over to one side like it sometimes does with delivery people who dont care
i do care

nilda looks at him and sees right away hes not going anywhere
nilda goes into the apartment and we hear her talking in spanish to a male
mookie bends down to tie his sneakers
nilda reappears and holds out a lonely lone dollar for him
mookie has her hold it out for awhile then he takes it
nilda slams the door
your pizza is gonna be fucked next time

baked apple new york times record heatwave hits city pow
a powerful gush of water flies out right at the camera
ahmad has just turned on the johnny pump and the white stream of water flies across the street
this attracts all the people of the block
its a chance to cool off and momentarily beat the killer heat
they both scrape beer cans on the sidewalk
she stands with caution away from the fire hydrant
ella does not want to get wet
theyre still scraping away
folks young and old begin to get in the water and play
both now have cans with the ends scraped away and go to the johnny pump
punchy bends down behind the hydrant and places the can over the water
the can now directs the water into giant streams
ahmad sneaks up behind ella and picks her up
shes kicking and screaming furiously

ahmad is not having it
he carries a kicking ella into the middle of the street in direct line of fire
they both are hit with a blast of water and are soaked to the bone
ella starts to punch ahmad and chases after him
we hear the familiar rap music of radio raheems box
radio raheem is too cool
by the way hes dressed it could be fall not the hottest day of the year
but you could never tell it from him
hes too cool
raheem looks at cee he wants to get by and he doesnt want to get wet either
and if his box gets wet somebody is gonna die
cee knows this too
cee stands in front of the hydrant blocking the water so radio raheem can pass
he slowly bops across the street as all eyes watch
when hes clear cee moves and the water gushes out again as folks play
we hear a car horn blowing
people move out of the way as the vehicle speeds through the spray
an older man charlie stops his white convertible and blows his horn
im not playing

the people all move to the car for they know what is about to happen
cee and punchy leap off the hydrant unleashing a jet blast that flies directly into charlies car
the whole block is dying
charlie pulls his flooded car over to the curb jumps out and runs to get hold of cee and punchy
of course hes slow as the kids turn into track stars and make like carl lewis
charlie a wet mess tries to buy some sympathy from the folks none is to be bought

the man looks at the crowd of blacks and puerto ricans around him and he considers what he just heard

on a stoop a group of puerto ricans sits talking drinking cerveza frio and playing dominoes
one of their cars is parked near the stoop and blasts salsa music
as usual we hear the rap music of radio raheem but underneath the salsa music
radio raheem does not like to be bested the salsa music from the parked car is giving him competition this is no good
radio raheem stands in front of the stoop and raises his decibel level
the puerto rican men look at him then begin to yell at him in spanish
there is a standoff the rap and salsa clashing in a deafening roar
one of the men stevie gets off the stoop and goes to the car
stevie turns the car radio off
radio raheem smiles nods turns his box to a reasonable listening level and bops down the block
radio raheem still the loudest
radio raheem still the king
you got it bro
the men curse in spanish and shake their heads in bewilderment and stevie turns the salsa back on
vito and mookie see buggin out on their way back to sals

buggin out gives mookie five and a menacing look at vito
vito is down
buggin out is walking down the block when clifton a yuppie accidentally bumps into him stepping on his new sneakers
he looks at his sneakers
there is a big black smudge on his new white unlaced air jordans
he runs down the block after clifton
clifton turns around

buggin out looks down at his marred air jordans

we see stoop ball double dutch hand games bike riding skateboarding etc
radio raheem approaches mookie
i was going to buy a slice
ill be back after i make this delivery
on the rebound
mookie stares at the gold brass knuckles rings radio raheem wears on each hand
spelled out across the rings are the words love on the right hand and hate on the left hand
thats the dope
i just copped them
let me tell you the story of right hand left hand the tale of good and evil
he thrusts up his left hand
it was with this hand that brother cain iced his brother
he thrusts up his right hand
see these fingers they lead straight to the soul of man
the right hand
the hand of love
mookie is buggin
the story of life is this
he locks his fingers and writhes cracking the joints
one hand is always fighting the other
left hand hate is kicking much ass and it looks like right hand love is finished
stop the presses
love is coming back yes its love
love has won
left hand hate koed by love
mookie doesnt know what to say so he doesnt say anything

radio raheem enters sals with music blaring
no service till you turn dat shit off
turn it off
mister radio raheem i cant even hear myself think

sal grabs his mickey mantle bat from underneath the counter
everyone sal vito pino radio raheem and the customers are poised for something to jump off static
he smiles and turns off the beat
two slices extra cheese
sal puts mickey mantle back into its place
when you come in sals famous pizzeria no music
no rap no music
this is a place of business
extra cheese is two dollars
mookie hands the pizzas over and takes the money and counts it
mookie walks says hello to the people he knows
mookie runs up stoop
we hear a key in the door the lock turns and mookie enters

mookie turns on the shower and screams the water is ice cold
mother sister sits in her window looking out at the block
da mayor has fallen asleep sitting on his stoop
his hands loosely hold a brown paper bag that is tightly twisted around a beer can
sweet dick ml and coconut sid each hold an umbrella for protection from the hot and harsh rays
ahmad punchy cee and ella sit on a fire escape trying to keep still trying to find a cool spot in the shade
no one says a word
sal takes a seat at one of the tables
pino sits down next to his father

the once white hot sun is now turning into a golden orange glaze as it begins to set
ahmad cee punchy and ella dance on the roof around a box that is turned into we love
each one is trying to come up with some new moves a new dance and a name for it
radio raheem is walking down the block and there is something wrong something is not quite right
his music is not loud the rap song begins to drag and finally stops altogether
he looks at his box and presses the battery level indicator
the needle doesnt move
his batteries have had it
twenty d duracells
twenty c duracells
d not c
you dumb motherfucker
learn how to speak english first
radio raheem points to the d batteries behind the counter
how many you say
radio raheem has to laugh at that one
just gimme my twenty duracells please
da mayor is looking at a bunch of cut flowers when radio raheem comes out with batteries in hand finally
mother sister is sitting in her window as usual
da mayor walks up the stoop with a bunch of fresh cut flowers in a discarded wine bottle for a vase
da mayor holds them out for mother sister who does not acknowledge him at all
id thought you might like these
i guess not
da mayor takes a seat on the stoop and puts the flowers to his face
aint nuthin like the smell of fresh flowers
dont you agree miss mother sister
mother sister does not answer
he puts the flowers down
summertime all ya can smell is the garbage
stink overpowers everything especially soft sweet smells like flowers
he looks up at mother sister who immediately turns away
if you dont mind im gonna set right here catch a breeze or two then be on my way
da mayor looks up at the setting sun
thank the lord the sun is going down its hot as blazes
the sun is an orange and purple glaze
radio raheem is back in action
hes alive hes bad and he got his twenty d duracell batteries his box is kicking
radio raheem bops by coconut sid ml and sweet dick willie
close coconut sid ml and sweet dick willie all three shake their heads in bewilderment as radio raheem goes by

sweet dick willie gets up from his chair and goes to the corner zips down his pants and urinates
ml hold this for me
sweet dick willie and coconut sid laugh

sweet dick willie zips up his pants and returns to his seat

an old puerto rican man rings a bell as he pushes a cart on wheels
on the side of the cart is hand lettered helado de coco and a big block of ice rests on top surrounded by different colored bottles of flavors
a group of kids eagerly waits for the ices
the man scrapes the block of ice puts the shavings in a paper cup and drowns it with syrup
da mayor is walking down the street
we hear the familiar tune from the mister softee truck as it comes down the street
eddie the young kid who earlier ran an errand for da mayor looks up from the sidewalk where hes playing and runs out into the street in pursuit of mister
eddie is running in pursuit of the truck unaware of the oncoming speeding car
da mayor sees speeding car bearing down on eddie
da mayor runs across the street and knocks eddie down out of the way of the car
both are thrown as they are hit by the reckless driver
eddie is crying as da mayor picks him up
doctor you know better to run out in the street
stop crying son
a crowd gathers
doctor theres nothing to cry about
a woman in her twenties louise eddies mother breaks through the crowd and hugs her baby
mayor knocked me down
you should be ashamed of yourself
maam the boy is just scared to death
what actually happened is that i was minding my business when i saw your son about to be run over
i ran into the street to save him and i had to knock him down to keep the both of us from getting hit
the crowd agrees thats the way it happened and louise stands up
eddie is that the truth
eddie is quiet
eddie you hear me talkin to you
eddie is still mum
im talkin to you boy
miss the boy is fine
louise hits eddie on da butt
eddie starts to dance as his mother hits hard shes heavy handed
what i tell you bout lying

eddie runs away
and when your father comes home hes gonna wear ya little narrow behind out too
you didnt have to hit your son hes scared to death as it was
i appreciate ya helping my eddie

louise goes away probably to give her son another whooping
da mayor tips his hat to her
sal sits at a table talking to jade as she finishes her special slice
sal that was delicious
vito pino and mookie look on watching sal have the time of his life
jade gets up and mookie helps her

da mayor is walking by mother sister in her window when she calls him

he gets up
mookie walks into the kitchen and sees carmen tinas mother fixing some food on the stove
carmen stares at him its a look that would definitely stop traffic she mutters some spanish and goes into her bedroom slamming the door behind her
he opens the refrigerator and takes out all the trays of ice
mookie sits down on the bed with a bowl filled with ice cubes
mookie rubs an ice cube on her forehead

weve seen it at daytime but now we see it at night
even though the white hot sun is gone nonetheless the heat is still stifling
and in a peculiar funny sort of way its worse
you expect it to be hot during the light of day when the sun is beating down on the cement and tar but at night it should be considerably cooler
well not tonight its hot
all the residents of the block the corner men mother sister da mayor jade etc
all the people weve seen throughout the day are now coping with the night time heat plus its humid as shit
everyone is outside sitting on stoops on cars and you know the kids are playing running up and down the block
now its the hottest night of the year
buggin out sits down on a car next to radio raheem as usual his box is blasting

vito pino and mookie are cleaning up
sal its almost quitting time so please start counting my pay
i gotta get paid
sal is looking into the cash register
we did good business today
we got a good thing going
nothing like a family in business working together
one day the both of you will take over
and mookie there will always be a place for you at sals famous pizzeria
yknow it should be sals and sons famous pizzeria
all three look at each other
the horror is on their faces with the prospect of working slaving in sals and sons famous pizzeria trapped for the rest of their lives
is this their future
its a frightening thought
ahmad cee punchy and ella enter
were about to close
just four slices regular slices
ok but thats it
its been a long day
mookie goes over to the table where ahmad cee punchy and ella sit
look i want you to get your slices then outta here
no playing around
you got it
we all wanna go home
we hear the dum dum dum of radio raheems box
as everyone turns their heads to the door buggin out and radio raheem are inside already
we have never heard the rap music as loud as it is now
you have to scream to be heard and thats what they do
what did i tell ya bout dat noise
what did i tell ya bout dem pictures
what da fuck
are you deaf
no are you
we want some black people up on the wall of fame
turn that jungle music off
we aint in africa
ahmad cee punchy and ella start to dance while mookie takes a seat the impartial observer that he is
why it gotta be about jungle music and africa
its about turning that shit off and getting the fuck outta my pizzeria
what ever happened to nice music with words you can understand
this is music
youre closed alright till you get some black people up on that wall
sal grabs his mickey mantle bat from underneath the counter and brings it down on radio raheems box again and again and again
the music stops
radio raheems pride and joy is smashed to smithereens
its going to the junkyard quick
there is an eerie quiet as everyone is frozen surprised by the suddenness of sals action the swings of his mickey mantle bat
all look at radio raheem and realize what is about to happen
radio raheem screams he goes crazy
radio raheem picks sal up from behind the counter and starts to choke his ass
radio raheems prized possession his box the only thing he owned of value his box the one thing that gave him any sense of worth has been smashed to bits
radio raheem like many black youth is the victim of materialism and a misplaced sense of values
now he doesnt give a fuck anymore
hes gonna make sal pay with his life
vito and pino jump on radio raheem who only tightens his grip around sals neck
buggin out tries to help his friend
mookie just stands and watches as ahmad cee punchy and ella cheerlead
the tangled mass of choking biting kicking screaming confusion flies through the door of sals out onto the sidewalk
the kid yells fight
he looks up
she looks up
he also looks up
the people on the block run to sals famous pizzeria to see the static
radio raheem buggin out sal vito and pino are still entangled rolling around on the sidewalk but now before an entertained crowd of onlookers break it up
this is crazy
the fight continues
da mayor is smart enough not to get in the middle of this war
we hear sirens somebody has called
the cop cars come right through the crowd almost running over some people
the cops get out with nightsticks and guns drawn
we recognize two of the faces officers long and ponte
any time there is a skirmish between a black man and a white man you can bet the house on who the copes are gonna go for
you know the deal
buggin out is pulled off first then vito and pino but radio raheem is a crazed man
it takes all six cops to pull him off sal who is red as a beet from being choked
handcuffs are put on buggin out as he watches the other cops put a choke hold on radio raheem to restrain him
radio raheem is still struggling then he just stops his body goes limp and he falls to the sidewalk like a fifty pound bag of idaho potatoes
officers long and ponte kick him
radio raheem just lies there like a bump on a log
the crowd stares at radio raheems still body
hes unconscious or dead
the officers all look at each other
they know they know exactly what theyve done
the infamous michael stewart choke hold
lets get him outta here
the officers pick up radio raheems limp body and throw him into the back seat
buggin out is pushed into another car
the cop cars speed off in their haste to beat it they have left the crowd
its at this point the crowd becomes an angry mob
the mob looks at
sal still on the sidewalk being helped to his feet by vito and pino who are in bad shape themselves
the mood tone of the mob is getting ugly
once again they have seen one of their own killed before their eyes at the hands of the cops
we hear the murmurs of the folks go through the crowd
the cops in their haste to get radio raheem out of there have left an angry mob of black folks with a defenseless sal vito and pino
the mob looks at them
mookie looks at the crowd and notices hes on the wrong side
he leaves sal and his two sons
da mayor walks in front of the crowd
good people lets all go home
somebodys gonna get hurt
if we dont stop this now well all regret it
sal and his two boys had nothing to do with what the police did
get out of the way old man
you a tom anyway
let em be
mookie picks up a garbage can and dumps it out into the street
he walks through the crowd up to da mayor sal vito and pino
mookie hurls the garbage can through the plate glass window of sals famous pizzeria
all hell breaks loose
the dam has been unplugged broke
the rage of a people has been unleashed a fury
a lone garbage can thrown through the air has released a tidal wave of frustration
da mayor pushes sal vito and pino out of the way as the mob storms into sals famous pizzeria
the people rush into sals famous pizzeria tearing it up
the cash register is opened
we see only coins sal has the paper
da mayor leads sal vito and pino back to his stoop where they watch in horror
there it goes
you was there
first white folks they saw
you was there
someone lights a match
sals famous pizzeria is going up in flames and now its a carnival
burn it down
burn it down
one might have thought that the elders who through the years have been broken down whipped their spirits crushed beaten into submission would be docile strictly onlookers
thats not true except for da mayor
the rest of the elders are right up in it with the young people
the photos of famous italian americans are burning
the mob now moves across the street in front of the korean fruit and vegetable stand
sweet dick willie coconut sid and ml stand at the head of the mob
its your turn
hes scared to death as the mob is poised to tear his place up too
the clerk wildly swings a broom to hold them off
me no white
me no white
the mob starts to laugh they feel for him
korea man is ok
lets leave him alone
him no white
him no white
sal vito and pino look on as sals famous pizzeria goes up in smoke
jade is running through the mob looking for her brother
mookie is running around with the rest of the mob
the wail of fire trucks and police sirens is now added to the night
the mob moves back to in front of sals as the fire trucks and police in full riot gear pull up in the street behind them
the firemen rush to hook up their hoses the police force themselves between the crowd and the burning sals famous pizzeria
the mob doesnt listen they will not be moved
the mob will not be moved until they see sals famous pizzeria burn to the ground
the firemen douse the pizzeria trying desperately to stop the fire from spreading into the adjoining buildings
good people were giving you one more warning
please go back home
this is our home
this is our neighborhood
it will take force to move this mass of people
youve had your warning
the hoses are turned on the mob
we see mookie mother sister sweet dick willie ml coconut sid jade ahmad cee punchy and ella etc
go down before the powerful blast of the firehouse
now weve come full circle
were back to montgomery or birmingham alabama
the only thing missing is sheriff bull connor and the german shepherds
it would take force to move them and thats exactly what the mob got
people are trying to hold on to each other cars railings anything to keep from being swept away
da mayor sal vito and pino watch in disbelief
its unbelievable what is happening before their eyes
people are screaming kids and women are not being spared from the brute force of the firehoses either
we see the reflection of the fire in the storefront window as mister senor love daddy looks on
jade and mother sister try to hold on to a streetlamp as a gush of water hits them their grips loosens the water is too powerful and they slide away
down the block and da mayor runs after them
some burnt photos on the floor
the mickey mantle bat burns
radio raheems box has melted into a black mass of goo
as we move in tighter on the melted box we begin to hear the rap song that weve hear throughout
all other sound drops as the rap song gets louder and louder until its deafening
smiley sits up from where he hid during the burning and looting of sals famous pizzeria
smiley looks around and goes directly to the smoldering wall of fame
he stands there
smiley pins one of his malcolm x martin luther king jr
cards to the wall of fame
were on smileys face and a smile slowly travels across
its the first time smiley has smiled in years and nobody is there to see this event
the camera from high above cranes down on the block
the sidewalk is deserted broken glass is everywhere and it looks exactly as how one expects it to look the morning after an uprising
the camera now moves in on the we love storefront where mister senor love daddy is in his familiar place behind the mike
what can i say
say what i can
i saw it but i didnt believe it
i didnt believe it what i saw
are we gonna live together
together are we gonna live

da mayor wakes up in mother sisters big brass bed she was born in it
at first he has no idea where hes at then sees mother sister sitting down across the room smiling at him
is it a good morning
you almost got yourself killed last night
ive done that before
da mayor gets up out of her big brass bed
where did you sleep
i hope the block is still standing

da mayor and mother sister both look out the parlor window to see the block and mookie
mookie walks up to sals famous pizzeria as it still smoulders in the morning light
sal emerges from the wreckage he looks like he might have slept there
whatdafuck do you want
i wants my money
i wants to get paid
sal looks at mookie in disbelief
mookie i always liked you

mookie is stunned by sals outburst
he picks up the bills

mookie turns around and goes back
doctor this is sal talkin

mookie thinks about it looks at the two c notes still smiling up at him
he quickly scoops them up
i got it
as mookie turns and walks away sal goes back into sals famous pizzeria to salvage what is salvageable and the block begins to awake from its slumber ready to deal
once again with the heat of the hottest day of the year
