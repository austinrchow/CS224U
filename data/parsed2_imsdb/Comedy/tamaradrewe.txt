written by moira buffini based on the book by posy simmonds th october andy cobb early thirties is digging an english garden in the hot sun
he is lean naked to the waist
its hard to tell which century he inhabits
only when he stops to drink from a plastic bottle do we realise he is of our time
and love slipped the bonds of restraint
at a table under a willow tree sits tess early fifties funky specs at a laptop
she pauses in her typing staring at andy
his touch was like a cosmic yes
underneath a converted barn cross legged on a bench in a bikini top sits eustacia
she is hunched over a note pad writing at tremendous speed oblivious to all but her work
fuck you screamed kelly fuck you to hell
scott stepped back from the cell door as the gob of spit flew
sitting at a barn window is american academic glen mccreavy a physically awkward man more at home with his intellect than his body
he is surrounded by foolscap post it notes books and markers dominated by a poster of a dour victorian thomas hardy
he is writing
this complex contemporary matrix is what hardy meant by the ache of modernism
he regards it
he deletes it
he looks at his blank screen breathing deeply
the only words left say chapter six
inchcombe had seen it all before
hed seasoned it the metallic smell of blood and gunshot forensics hunched like vultures
the dreadful mundanity of murder he thought
nicholas hardiment writes fluidly with pencil and paper
a good looking man of fifty
dark hair strong figure
he approached patel who was stricken
she was one for whom a corpse was still an obscenity
inchcombe realised a disturbing truth
his lack of feeling was almost
he stops writing
a playground on the edge of an idyllic english village
jody long fourteen skinny restless is lying at the bottom of the slide gazing at the clouds
casey shaw her shy placid best friend is sitting on a toddler toy reading aloud from a magazine
ive been wearing the wrong size all my life said katie
i was always popping out
turns out im a gg she says
now my bras finally fit though simon prefers me without one
jody checks to see if her breasts have grown
a woman in an upmarket apron is taking a tray of scones and biscuits out of the aga
its beth hardiment
once pretty shes now mumsy and countrified
she examines her baking satisfied with its perfection
mary the help is doing the washing up
do you think i should be reminding them to drink enough
its very hot out there
beth theyre writers not babies
you run round after em too much
glen walks outside breathing in the fresh air
beth approaches with her tray of scones and biscuits
can i tempt you glen
glen picks up a scone
i often take something snacky down to nicholas at this time of day
i know how the brain needs feeding
how are you settling in
the last writers retreat i stayed at kind of froze my balls off you know
screeching firedoors curried lasagne and a needy poet from whom i still bear the scars
we try to keep it peaceful here far from the madding crowd
well its paradise
the blight on this rural paradise is a vandalised bus shelter near the only t junction in the village
a twee shop hanging baskets and grade ii listed buildings make up the view
its shatteringly dull
casey and jody walk up towards the bus shelter
their boredom is epic
an open topped bmw goes past and halts briefly by the junction
the tones of classic fm blare out much to the enjoyment of the middle aged couple within
this weeks top of the shocks goes to katie pound in an off the shoulder lime by roberto
she looks like a bug
car hoots wankers
you wanna sack your stylist girl
bet they did that on purpose dressed her up like an insect
they zoom away
glen lowers himself into a comfy garden chair his mouth full of cream and jam
behind him nicholas shed
nicholas is panicking down the phone
nadia what the ffff are you doing there
i havent told her yet
nadia is walking up the road from the station in her high heels carrying an overnight bag
she is weeping into her phone
you keep saying you want to be with me
jody and casey are all ears
i cant tell her just like that
its twenty five years a marriage
come on nicholas
or im going to get in a taxi and find your farm
come up there and drag you out i want to be with you
i thought youd be pleased
through the window nicholas sees beth leaving a scone by diggory a sleeping poet in a pretentious hat
of course im pleased
nadia go to the pub and stay there
ill come when i can
are you going to tell her
just give me a couple of hours he ends the call just as beth is nearing the door panicking the phone back on to its holder
beth opens the door to see nicholas apparently hard at it
hows the worker
just about to embark on forensics
well give me your pages and ill get started
nicholas hands her several pages
reckon i might pack it in a bit early today
need to think about my blood smears
might take a drive have a pint
stir the old grey matter up
who were you talking to just then
she says the impala contracts should be through in a day or two
beth immediately knows he is lying
the lie pains her
she goes to the door
beth decides to try and call his bluff
i could come with you
for a drive
i dont know when we last went out
buying time by biting his scone this is absolutely yummy
we could go into hadditon get a meal
what about the guests
marys got casey to help
but im supposed to be thinking you know about the you can run it by me
im good at forensics
nicholas has run out of excuses
beth approaches andy with her scones and biscuits
nearby glen is sitting back in a sun lounger
diggory sleeps on
can i tempt you andy
andy takes a scone with a wide smile
thats glen our new academic
turns out hes working on thomas hardy
said he might have some farming questions
needs an expert yokel does he
would you mind
and the writers are eating al fresco tonight could you check theres no bird shit on the seats
beth looks distant troubled
nicholas and i are going out to dinner
as she walks away andy glances at the shed a look of puzzled dislike on his face
glen settles back in his chair
nicholas dreading his predicament is staring out at a cows arse
the cow starts to piss
he shuts his eyes in desperation
shooting from inside the car we pass the sign ewedown
the same car drives through the village
jody and casey appear from behind a wall and chuck eggs at it
they both land on the windscreen
jody and casey run away laughing
the driver brakes swerves and comes to a halt
tamara drewe gets out
shes twenty eight startlingly beautiful
she looks around shocked for the culprit
the immaculate picturesque street is deserted
tamara takes it in with an expression of such distaste that it might as well be a landfill site
what a dump
as she drives away we see nadia sitting outside the pub in her urban heels anxiously smoking a cigarette
tamara drives up to an old farmhouse
she gets out of the car and stands at the gate
air of neglect dark windows
tamara looks at the place as if it stirs memories
she doesnt move
at the back of the house tamara walks through an overgrown neglected garden
she peers through the back door into the kitchen
a thin layer of dust on the surfaces a sense of recent abandonment
suddenly a pigeon flies out from the porch eaves just over her head
it completely spooks her
she backs away
she doesnt know what to do
jody and casey are slouched on the bench at the bus stop
three teenage boys are doing wheelies over the t junction
one of them almost lands in the shop
an old lady comes out shoo ing them away
we could walk up the garage
im supposed to be helping my mum up at stonefield
they keep you busy
you never stop you
neither of them moves
the boys are yelling
two try to put the third head first into the bin outside the shop
jody and casey are not impressed
the writers are sitting round a table lit with tea lights in jars
casey is helping her mum mary an efficient local woman in her late thirties
she wobbles the heavy serving dishes dangerously
it was called from hearth to heath doomsday and revelation in victorian verse
what was it about
oh you know
pale poets on laudanum dark towers and sunless seas a little sturm and drang in a teacup
at an upstairs window we can see beth hold a dress up to herself and then abandon the idea
did it sell
well my kind of books arent about sales
i mean thats not why i write
what are you working on next
upstairs through a window we see beth is putting on a blouse
beth is looking at herself in a cheval mirror
shes full of hope that nicholas will take her out and dread that hell find some excuse
is there anything left to say about that maudlin bore
excuse me but there is nothing dull about hardy
that is a misconception
at least youve been published
im seething with envy id love to be published
i publish myself on the internet
oh do you earn money doing that
so what do you write
casey drops a potato in glens wine
im here picking up tips from the master
the door to the garden is open letting in the eveing air
nicholas is waiting for beth by the mirror
he is full of unease but cant help finding himself handsome
his phone bleeps a text
he reads it anxiously
beth why dont i just pop out on my own
beth determined to force things comes downstairs
but im ready
shes on her way to join him
is that i mean are you wearing that
just looks a bit
now beth knows she is right
she takes her jacket off gutted
you know hadditions always packed with pissed londonites on a friday
i doubt well get a table anyway
lets do it properly next week make an occasion
im always taking you for granted
im vile i know you should kick me really but hes about to leave
beth speaks calmly
who is she
the question hangs in the air
nicholas smile is frozen
for a moment he tries to find a lie
oh come on beth
look its nothing
its been once or twice thats all
beth its not anything
beth is raw with pain
her voice raised who is she
tess faintly hears
she stops mid chew listening for more
nicholas coughs up
just a researcher with radio
whats her name
nadia nadia patel
this hits a nerve
shes in your book
no no i met her when i was on desert island discs
you put her in your book
just the name
and desert island discs was a year ago
yes but once or twice
i was going to tell you but beth utters an inchoate cry
tess hears it
beths pained voice drifts out of the house
you lying pig
a hush falls over the table
beth im a ruin i know but ive been in a real state about this
i didnt want to hurt you
another wounded cry from beth
in the kitchen andy picks up his plate and goes
beth is incandescent
how can you lie to my face
can we talk calmly about this
there are people out there you look me in the face and lie
for gods sake were surrounded by you bastard
a thrilled intake of breath goes round the table
the writers with the exception of glen who is mortified are poised like scavengers waiting for more
beth were like a pair of compasses
dont you dare joined solidly at the top but with the ends able to roam in freedom his phone beeps
thats from her isnt it
are you keeping her waiting
nicholas finally snaps
weve talked a lot about the creative mind and we agreed that it needs freedom to explore
leaving the house take your freedom
i cant live like this any more
it makes me feel worthless
casey gawps fascinated
nicholas is following beth outside
her agony travels through the quiet evening air
the writers are open mouthed
calm yourself down
go set up home with patel
see if she does your tax return
will you please do you love her
diggorys fork stays in mid air
glen is horribly fascinated
this is pointless
is she young
for heavens sake
the guests are hanging on every word
beth retreats back into the house
if you leave here tonight to be with her
dont come back
for a moment she hopes hell apologise
youre making fools of us both
beth tears stinging picks a plant out of the tub by the door and hurls it roots and all
its a direct hit
beth slams the door
nicholas wipes soil off his glasses brushes it off his shirt
he realises with a sinking heart that he must pass the writers to get to his car
i didnt know they provided material too
beth her back to the door is regretting her gesture
beth does everything for him you types his manuscripts deals with his agent makes his female characters convincing
nicholas still at the door listening
she even came up with the name dr inchcombe
no wonder hes bored
i hope she takes him to the fucking cleaners
nicholas walks to his car
he roars away
beth comes into the kitchen
her eyes flicker over pictures of her daughter and nicholas
she is in shock
glen is mortified
at the end of the day this is why im glad to be single
beth is going through agonies of self criticism
we see her thoughts an exotic clinch
nicholas in thrall to nadias confident passion
why would he choose me
the gossip flutters round the table
will she take him back thats the question
id be torn
hes far too up himself
what about the farm though
splitting up all this
must be worth a fortune
i think shes very rash making him choose
alone beth weeps
nicholas is walking nadia to his car
thought you werent going to come
i was busy
rowing with my wife
where are we going
to your farm
a look of frustration crosses his face
he turns to her
we could have gone on just as we were
but you said you wanted to be with me
now and then
nadia looks at him
the scales are beginning to fall
they get in the car
as they drive away tamaras car pulls up
she gets out of the car and takes in the pub before entering
zoe a buxom australian is behind the bar
big glass of rioja please
and i need a room
sure how many nights
zoe pours the wine
shes disarmingly friendly
you here on business
business of a kind
i dont mean to pry im just really nosey
im from here
tamara smiles her disagreement
i keep meaning to leave but
hard to get away
my mums house is just up the road
youre not staying with her
zoe finishes pouring the wine
have that on me
and heres your key
up the stairs right in front
you cant miss it
tamara utters her thanks surprised at zoes kindness
she takes her drink and the key upstairs
zoe remains grinning
we see why
andy cobb has just walked in
zoe pulls him a pint
didnt think id see you tonight
bit of an atmosphere at stonefield
tell me everything
andy shakes his head
remind me never to try it
andy youre just a sex object
no oned have you
he grins back at her
tamara is in a deep bubble bath
she glances at herself in the mirror scrutinising her beauty
she fingers her nose
slowly a look of doubt steals over her as if shes not quite comfortable in her own skin
glen is eating his breakfast looking at all the hardiments family memorabilia in the kitchen
andy is eating toast
so the hardiments have lived here centuries huh
no bout twenty years
still strangers by local standards
beth comes in tense anxious and haggard
andy come and look at ingrid
i think shes coming into heat
she goes out
shes a nice lady
yeah i owe her a lot
husbands a sleazebag huh
wed say prick here actually
we might even call him a fuck
thats good too
andy approaches beth
she is cleaning out the hen coop with all the frenetic energy of an abandoned wife
this is going rotten underneath
shall we look at ingrid
its falling apart
i can do that
andy takes the shovel
beth bites back tears
he wont last five minutes
beth looks down embarrassed by but grateful for his support
glen wanders into beths office
the wall in front of him is dominated by a framed newspaper profile of nicholas surrounded by framed covers of inchcombe books
the whole room is a shrine to nicholas career
glen is in the hall looking at beths prints and pictures old maps wildlife and framed letters from grateful writers who have stayed at the retreat
he stares at a print of farm workers in the nineteenth century
i know why im drawn to thomas hardy
he writes about failure better than anyone else
i need this book to go well
i need a tiny reward for my endeavours
his stomach gurgles ominously
i need a dump
glen walks down the corridor by the kitchen to the downstairs cloakroom a marvellous victorian toilet of reassuring size
he shuts the door in relief
glen is on the loo
even in this small room there are framed photographs of nicholas receiving awards
he looks at them in wonder
if thats the way you feel
nadia im devastated
through the frosted window glen sees nicholas
but if thats your decision ill have to learn to live with it
beth comes in from the garden
glen sees nicholas quickly end the call
for beths benefit into his phone i told you
i love my wife
dont ever phone me again
glen is shocked by this duplicity
no dont touch me dont you dare
glen panics realising their reunion is going to be right by the door
he puts his hand on the flush hoping to warn them too late
not good enough
not any more
you do what you like and then youre sorry
i hate myself
i hate myself
glen opens the door a chink
they are feet away from him
nicholas looks unshaven shagged and guilty
where were you
drove her back to london
took all night
you drove her home
she was in a state
do you think shell get over it
to glens horror he starts to cry
then beth is sobbing too
they are in each others arms holding each other
i dont know why im like this
i couldnt do without you
glen looks away from the clinch horribly embarrassed
he opens the toilet window puts the soap dish straight
looks again still hugging sobbing kissing puts his hand on the flush too awful to reveal himself takes it off again
straightens his hair examines his teeth sweating
he looks again
at last the emotion is abating
nicholas releases beth
she wipes her eyes
ive got to go to the bottle bank
lets talk later
the goats come into heat
i love you so much
nicholas is watching her his expression strange
he walks away
at last glen emerges incredulous at nicholas lies
glen flops into a sun lounger near diggory
ive just seen the hardiments kiss and make up
the hat is on
looks like shes taking him back
when the hat is on it means dont speak
peace is restored
the sound of a burglar alarm suddenly blares over the garden
diggory sits up infuriated
glen is following andy down the hill from stonefield
the cows are too close for glens comfort
he hurries through
i dont like cows
i mean really
they exude bovine malice
yeah these girls are killing machines
they dont like americans either
glen and andy are in the valley between the two farms
its winnards farm
lady there died a while back
place is empty
you think its being robbed
probly just kids
nothing to do round here except make trouble
what if its bad guys
dont you have a blunderbuss or a fowling piece or something
they climb up through a copse
glen and andy are going up the hill towards winnards
used to belong to my dad this place
but it all went tits up
land was flogged to a consortium and the house was sold to londoners the drewes
so this is your ancestral pile
born in that room up there
he points up at the back bedroom window
you must have been pretty resentful
an eighteen year old andy jumps off a stile into the lane behind a slim fifteen year old girl on a horse
the girl turns
she has a huge nose
this farms mine big nose
the girl kicks the horse into a trot her nose in the air
andy and glen turn the corner to the back of the house
tamara is up a ladder wielding a hammer at the alarm box
hey whatre you doing
tamara gives the alarm box a great whack
who are you
andy you moron its me
andy looks more closely
a disturbing spark of recognition
hardly recognise you
the noise becomes a high pitched squeal
you wont do it that way
then help me
andy turns the alarm off
tamara enters the dusty kitchen
used to do bits of work for your mum
been keeping an eye on the place since she died
what sort of work graphics
i do horticulture now
youre a gardener
andy says nothing
he stares at her nose
glen has come in
this is a great old house
would you like to buy it
im not really the property owning kind
prefer my life to fit into hand luggage
thats why youre back to flog it
make a nice second home for some banker wankers
andy if you want it why dont you make me an offer
because sadly im still prey to the economic forces that threw the peasant classes off the land
tamara opens a cupboard
its full of empty wine bottles
their eyes meet
what the fuck have you done to yourself
tamaras face falls
glen and andy are walking back
andy is brooding
shes completely different
how was she before
whats the story
there isnt one
just a teenage thing
tamara pulling down her pants andy unbuttoning his jeans
she jumps up on the worktable pushing a stack of turnips out of the way
they kiss passionately
you should find someone youre in love with
you stupid prick
andy looks at her
she is sincere
you saying you love me frosty tits
you say it youre the girl
she kisses him
as they start to make love i love you
i love you
glen looks over at andy interrupting his thoughts
romeo and juliet huh
andy carries on down the hill shaking his head
tamara is watching andy walk away with glen
her eyes follow him curiously then she firmly turns her back
tamara rips a bin liner off the roll and shakes it out
she takes a deep breath
she opens the cupboard and begins to bin the distressing mountain of empty wine bottles
beth is standing at the hedge looking down at the valley with nicholas at her side
thinking of the first time we saw this place
youve made it a wonderful home beth
not wonderful enough
she starts to walk away
nicholas holds her back
if you cant put this behind you then were stuck
well id better sort myself out then
what has to happen
i am sorry beth brings her arm up to push him away
nicholas catches it draws her to him
he kisses her insistently
beths resistance diminishes
soon it has gone
we begin to see the depth of beths physical love for him
at that moment glen walks round the corner
he tries to backtrack mortified by his intrusion on their passion
nicholas turns away in frustration
just taking the air
flustered he knocks into a tub of lobelias
beth and nicholas remain
the moment between them is gone
round the corner glen is cringing
jody and casey are reading a celebrity magazine
would you do him
what about him
hes gay you dobbin
they turn to a big spread on a band called swipe
id walk through fire to do him
hes not just the drummer
he writes the lyrics its his band
hes the fucking genius not steve culley or any of these wankers
id do ben
i wanna be her in that dress with him licking my teapot lids
casey is still carrying this image as she serves a tray of nibbles on the patio
she stands among the writers watching a fly get caught in one of the vol au vents
people talk about the muscularity in prose
i want a similar muscularity in my verse
i dont want a poetry thats flabby or obese thats why i adhere to the tightest rhyme schemes diggory picks the vol au vent up and without looking puts it
in his mouth
casey moves over to nicholas and glen
abb acc dee d
they give you the armature the beating heart the nerve ends
so has the muse shone on you greg
ive been pretty distracted
most recently by those delicious cookie things that beth brought round this afternoon
of course we call them biscuits here
and by the place itself the people
sometimes wish i could get distracted
ten page a day man rain or shine
wow thats scary
ten pages how do you do that
well greg i wouldnt presume to give an academic tips
matter of fact i read one of your books
another distraction but i thought it was decent stuff
how do i do it
i just get on with it greg
nicholas walks away leaving glen smarting
the female writers surround nicholas
he tops them up full of charm
under his breath glen impersonates we call them biscuits here
nicholas raises his glass for a toast
to the muse however you find her
he is looking at beth
she is gratified
then his eye shifts his glass still in the air
tamara drewe is climbing the stile at the bottom of the garden in a low cut t shirt tiny pair of denim shorts and bare feet
the evening light bathes her in a golden sheen
thats tamara drewe
no it isnt
i met her with andy
whats happened to her
shes had a nose job dad
shes completely different
thats what andy said
such a sad girl
she used to come and help you wash the car didnt she nicholas
i think she liked a bit of family after her dad left
is that tamara drewe who writes the column in one of the sundays
writes for the independent now
she spent weeks going on about her nose job
smart way to pay for it i suppose
was her old one an awful conk
shes poured herself into those shorts
i hope they dont give her thrush
whats the etiquette with nose jobs
do we mention it or
tamara has arrived in earshot
absolutely everyone including a very curious casey is staring at her nose
sorry to intrude
her hand defensively brushes her nose
poppy walks towards her full of warmth
poppy how are you
love your new hooter
it isnt actually new just smaller
at last beth remembers her manners
tamara so sorry about your mum
are you staying down for a while
ill have to
theres so much to be done
you must let us know if we can help
actually i was going to ask if you could spare a pair of strong arms
ive got a skip coming tomorrow and nicholas
nicholas is opening another bottle of prosecco
it pops its cork over his trousers
he mutters a swear word
i do skips
well thank you
youre very kind
is andy around at all
beth is helping nicholas wipe his trousers
oh i cant spare andy
hes making a new coop for my buff orpingtons
tamara and glen are carrying junk out to a skip
tamara is in big boots and a slightly more practical pair of shorts
beth is preparing lunch talking to poppy
nicholas is going through his typed up manuscript not really listening
shes had the writers down there helping her all day
i hope she realises theyre here to work
cant believe what a difference her nose makes
well i think its a mistake taken away all her character
come on she looks ten times better
and she knows it
i found those shorts really irritating
going around with half her bum hanging out
i mean why
to annoy people like you
might get a pair myself
of course you wont
because youre not desperate are you
always something a bit desperate about tamara drewe
beth looks at him puzzled as he works on
tamara and glen are having a rest
so why did you change your face
changing my face is the best thing i ever did
and i dont care what anyone thinks
would it work for me
maybe if you did the wrinkles too
oh youre just coming on to me
she starts work again
in your column you write about yourself
does that come easily
but it feels right
my first novels definitely going to be autobiographical
your first novel
youre going to dash one off just like that
ideally id like to make it into fiction before im thirty
and then maybe a swimwear collection a chat show a pasta sauce range
life sure is easy for the beautiful
you know before i got the nose job i had no trouble getting taken seriously
maybe when they removed that bit of cartilage they pulled my brain out by mistake what do you think
glen smiles won over
glen is coming from the bar with a pint for andy and a half for himself
he has just been served by zoe
shes single man
andy looks over at zoe
well its not exactly a relationship we just have an occasional thing
zoe doesnt want to be tied down and not zoe
you should get in there
marry the girl
then you get to live back in your ancestral home
not her type
the trouble is andy you think like a loser
and i know that because im the loser that losers turn to for tips
im the losers loser
im a pedigree loser
i had a graphics business went bust
and then with my great business acumen i invested in a polytunnel full of ganja
howd that go
made a tit of myself
spent about six years stoned out of my box and im only just getting it back together
besides even if i was the last man in the world tamara drewe wouldnt have me
i dumped her
oh you are a loser
i was twenty
my mates thought i was cradle snatching
and they used to call her beaky
tamara in her school uniform is gutted
we see her stricken face as she turns away
then she turns back and hits andy
his nose streams blood
glen is preparing to leave
you told her the truth
the time might come when she respects that
andy as your love guru i suggest you ask tamara for a date
but take a shower first ok
piss off glen
tamara is in her shorts and boots chucking empty bottles and old saucepans into the skip like an amazon
nicholas is at the hedge looking down the valley towards winnards farm
he is watching tamara like a hawk as if he cant quite believe what he is seeing
nicholas and tamara are polishing nicholas car
boys know nothing
nicholas looks up at her smiles indulgently
tamara stops work
ive been reading inchcombes dose
the bit where doctor inchcombe finds himself having thoughts about the dead guys daughter
tamara walks around the car bringing her polishing cloth closer to his
you describe her light smattering of freckles and her striking profile
she turns her head
who did you base her on
have you noticed me
nicholas looks at her in surprise
because ive noticed you
she waits hoping for a kiss a hug anything
she puts out a hand almost touches him
he steps back
think its time you went
tamara is mortified
youre making yourself ridiculous
this really hurts
tamara takes the bucket of soapy water and throws it over the car and nicholas
oh grow up
nicholas is still staring at tamara who is jumping on the stuff in the skip
glen is strolling up the hill from the pub
he follows nicholas gaze
a man can dream huh
nicholas looks at him affronted as if he doesnt know what hes talking about
tamara hot and dirty runs up the stairs with her roll of bin liners
she opens the door to her mothers bedroom
she is completely unprepared for it
a neat womanly room covered in photographs of tamara as a child teen and young woman
on the dressing table is a lipstick the lid lying next to it as if it has just been used
tamara picks it up
she sits suddenly exhausted
for the first time she looks lost
tamara still looks slightly shaken as she walks up to andy
he is watching ingrid meet darcy a billy goat
go on ingrid have some kids
pretty direct isnt he
hes not even bought her a coke
and he stinks
she doesnt mind its like lynx to her
if shes ready shell stand for him if not she wont
thats disturbing human
darcy is up and at it
thought youd have gone back to london by now
looks like im stuck here for a while
actually ive got a proposition for you
andy glances at the goats bad idea
we should go for a drink sometime tam
you know for old times sake
so we can reminisce about how i smashed your nose
you didnt smash it
yes i did
it just bled
the memory is between them
ive got to do the house up before i sell it
it looks like an eighties timewarp
would you like the job
he just looks at her
painting it and tidying the garden
good hourly rate
it cant be easy down there tam
what dyou mean
all the memories and stuff
is it that you want someone around
like when you look up id be there too
jesus christ the goats are giving ok its bollocks thats very sweet of you andy of course you wouldnt want to fraternise with your gardener
is that a yes
andy doesnt reply
come on goat whisperer i thought id be doing you a favour
i thought you needed the work
its all over with ingrid and darcy
shes had a shit time but shell still call him
hell lose her number
he wont ring her back
andys face cracks into a smile
he is won over
glen types a sentence
he reads it
he stares at the blank page
it stares back at him
just write you numbskull
you moron you dumb fuck write
glen is passing beths office
shes working through a stack of fan mail
she smiles when she sees him
hows thomas hardy
glen unburdens himself
im wasting my sabbatical
ive been working on this book forever why cant i finish it
im two years past my delivery date and fantail could ask for their chickenshit advance back
i cant write
im fucking constipated
its a disaster
he notices the in tray
is this all his fan mail
i do a couple of sessions a week to keep on top of it
pretty good at forging nicks signature
glen looks awed and defeated
would you like me to read it
youd do that
be glad to
if you think it would help
beth suddenly sees andy out of the window
just need andy barging in on you what an idiot
beth catches up with andy
if youre going into hadditon were really low on chicken feed
ill get it tomorrow
im on my way down to winnards
doing one or two jobs for tamara
shes got you helping her too
just painting decorating sorting the garden
beth is quite put out
andy that sounds like a lot
i need you here
i can easily do both
as long as youre not working for her in the hours that i pay you
without thinking she has made andy feel like a servant
i wont rip you off
he walks on leaving beth feeling very uncomfortable and somehow slightly bereft
andy comes in
he shouts into the house
got some colour charts for you to see
he sets out all the colours charts and plans he has been working on
she is dressed to kill
what would you choose for in here
id have this one
and then upstairs in the bedroom she starts gathering her things
so what dyou have to do to get a cup of tea round here
im off to work
suddenly tamara is no longer just a blast from the past
he sees a future a future that he wants
he slowly smiles back but shes already striding away
pounding rock music slightly distorted by distance
jody and casey are trying to get in over the boundary fence
a security guard is already running towards them
this is our village
our fucking field
jody is ready for a fight but casey pulls her back
beth is tending to ingrid making sure shes not scared by the noise
ingrid looks as if she couldnt give a damn
over by the barn she sees glen unaware that hes being watched breaking out of a mournful walk to groove to the music
at the other end of the farm nicholas is staring over the hedge with tissue paper ear plugs
he pretends his arm is a rifle like a little boy
he aims at the cows
swipe are playing bit like the libertines in their prime
there is one girl in the band bass guitarist fran redford
the drummer ben sergeant is also vocals
the lead singer steve culley is mixed race confident and charismatic
he is getting very up close and personal with fran
ben is getting more and more furious
in the wings we see tamara talking to a publicist trying to make herself heard above the roar of the music
she is pointing at steve and fran
the publicist nods
suddenly ben leaps up and takes hold of steve pulling him away from fran
there is a scuffle fran trying to separate the boys
ben takes a microphone
swipe is no more
steve culley is a cunt
ben storms off the stage
the audience are in uproar
hes seeing fran
i wont work with that tosser again
steve is coming into the wings
he punches ben
you fucking baby
he virtually lands on tamara
they both hit the ground
steve storms off fran following calling his name
ben is dazed
he looks up at tamara
im tamara drewe
im supposed to be interviewing you for the independent
she smiles sweetly smoothing his hair
it was scheduled for later but maybe nows a better time
jody casey and the boys are sharing a bottle of cider
they should let us in free
they come here drink our water use our fields they leave all their crap in our drains tamaras car sweeps past with the roof down
it is closely followed by a bright yellow porsche
ben is driving and his boxer dog boss is in the passenger seat
jody clocks him
she jumps up and down in the road with both arms waving
what are you doing
that was ben from swipe
jody and casey scream with delight chasing the car
ben skids his porsche to a halt right next to tamaras car
he jumps out
tamara is walking towards the door
the distant festival is still audible
tamara backs towards the door with ben inches away
youre not allergic are you
to indie drummers
who are your influences ben
everyone asks that
this your place
dyou want it
no i want something else
jody and casey arrive at the brow of the hill breathless
they see ben pin tamara against the door
who the fucks she
i seen her up at stonefield
shes got a nose made of plastic
how come she gets ben
ive loved him since march
just as bens about to kiss her tamara coolly opens the door and draws him into the house
jody is gutted feeling the full injustice of her life
tamara leads ben to the kitchen
the hall has been stripped
would you like a beer
tamara opens the fridge
ben is inches away
he still hasnt kissed her and hes just about to
moe tucker with the velvets
five foot nothing
used to stand up to play
put the snare drum on its side and hit it with mallets
you write all the songs thats pretty rare for a drummer
everything youve ever heard about drummers is total shit
you mean you dont spontaneously combust
she goes in to kiss him
but ben grabs a pair of chopsticks from a utensils jar
he starts to play around tamara hitting the surfaces the shelves and everything on them a brilliant rhythm
he gets closer and closer
tamara is utterly mesmerised
he still doesnt kiss her
any more questions
tamara is speechless
he kisses her
andy is walking in the copse up to tamaras
he spots a couple of wild mushrooms and picks them
in the distance he sees glen bending and stretching
a cow is looking at him over the fence
glen sees it and startles
the sight makes andy smile
he carries on towards winnards farm in high spirits
andy comes up to the house
he sees the yellow porsche then a large boxer dog sitting by the front garden
it starts barking at him
andy calms him right down
hey hey who are you mate lost are you
andy strokes boss
andy takes a key from under a flower pot
andy opens the kitchen door
you want breakfast
boss bounds inside and disappears
andy is puzzled
he steps into the hall
do you know about this dog tam he notices two half drunk beers
he wanders into the hall
he sees bens boots and most of tamaras clothes abandoned
the unmistakable moans of lovemaking are coming from tamaras room
he turns on his heels pained
andy strides back across the field chucking the mushrooms in the mud on his way
aa posy drawing aa postcard of winnards farm
the exterior is half decorated
two cars parked tamaras and the yellow porsche which looks more like a permanent fixture
the garden has been cleared and dug ready to plant
andy is stoking a bonfire
he is smouldering like the embers
he gives the yellow porsche an angry look
nicholas and glen are both walking in the field
they pass each other each managing a painful smile
how goes the opus
fine nicholas just fine
their smiles fade
nicholas descending into deep gloom glen into deep anxiety
beth is mending the engine of her huge mower
glen now wearing a scarf is sitting on the seat watching her work
its his most obscure novel the well beloved
most people have never even heard of it
about this guy of twenty who falls in love with a beautiful young woman
then when hes forty he meets the womans daughter and he falls in love with her
and finally when hes sixty he meets the oh he doesnt
falls in mystical love
hardy was like that in his life too
even as he aged he only had eyes for young women
like in one essential way he never grew up
in his trousers
he was still at it in his eighties
snow on the rooftop but fire in the cellar
why wont it come for you glen
the way you talk about its so engaging
yeah but theres an academic style you know
who are you writing for
whos your ideal reader
glen cant answer
because if you wrote the way you spoke
it would make me want to read hardy
if you wrote like you were talking to a friend
pass me that thing
glen passes it looking at beth as she tightens a bolt
try it now
glen turns the key
the engine starts
glen starts to drive the mower delighted
beth watches him amused
a cosy dinner for all the writers more ladies in their forties and fifties
nicholas is topping up his glass
i simply pander to popular taste
oh your books are far more than that
just airport fodder
glen at the foot of the table finds this modesty rich
your prose is so vivid
and inchcombe for all his flaws is a man with total integrity
who did you base him on nicholas
my books dont say anything profound
i cant pretend to be an intellectual not like glen here illuminating our ignorance with his critical glow but i do love prose
and i think i can turn a reasonable story
glen peers into the kitchen
beth is serving desserts
he goes to help her leaving the ladies around nicholas like cups around a teapot
let me help
they need dusting with this
i went to my room and i wrote for three hours
the time just vanished
thats great thats brilliant
i feel like a man whos just passed a gargantuan stool
sprig of mint on the top
glen returns to the dining room with two desserts
he listens to nicholas as he serves them
the real secret of being a writer is learning how to lie
a frisson of shock goes round the lady writers
because thats what storytellers are
thieves and liars
as he serves nicholas the basis of all excellence is truth
glens intellect wins the day
the room her mothers is empty except for a mattress on the floor clothes rail designer bean bag and desk
tamara is sitting at it tapping away on her pc almost pained with concentration
ben is bored
are you done yet
im just starting something
that poxy column
cant it wait
not the column
just stuff coming out
dont want to stop it
do it later
play with me
ben strums his guitar determined to get her attention
she is such fun shes sexy and she lives on an old farm but something gnaws away at me its causing me real harm
tamara what can you do with it
what can you do with her name
its stands there lonely and rhymeless its driving me nearly insane
tamara the lovely the ultimate dazzling girl make me pasta carbonara cos im ravenous tamara then shag me wearing your tiara
tamara is delighted
she leaps on him
andy is planting a bed
bens boxer dog is digging up work hes just done
andy swears at him under his breath
andy looks up
ben is at the bedroom window naked
can you let my dog in
jody and casey watch from behind the hedge as andy angrily goes to let the dog in
he must like kissing plastic
he doesnt love her
hes just on the rebound from losing fran numbing his pain with loads of empty rampant sex
what he really needs
is a fifteen year old from ewedown
stranger things happen
hes only ten years older and thats nothing
if he met me if he just met me
itd be love right
but id settle for sex
beth is feeding the hens
in your parents bedroom
still i suppose being an exhibitionist is part of his job strutting about on stage
he doesnt strut hes a drummer
he sits on his arse
very good looking isnt he
poppy you tubed him and we both got quite hot and bothered
is that his car the yellow porsche
bit brash vrooming through the village
but fancy our tamara bagging a bone fide rock star
she was such an ugly duckling
she must be thrilled to bits
andy cant listen to any more
andy peers through the door
zoe is setting tables
zoe lets him in
were not open for another hour
andy and zoe are in the near darkness making love against the wall
andy is lying on one of the seats his head on zoes lap
im going to move on soon andy
dont know if i can stick a winter here
the way the light disappears its doing me in
im a blue sky girl
got to have some warmth
andy just looks up at her smiling his understanding
we all need a bit of that dont we
boss is outside sniffing round the front door
sounds of the end of an epic shag from the upstairs window
he sits bored
he hears the noise of crows in the field
he is off like a shot
boss is having the time of his life chasing the cows
penny upminister an uppercrust landowner in a horrible coat is trying to catch him
the whole herd is now on the rampage boss in pursuit penny bringing up the rear
nicholas sees them heading straight for his shed
tamara is opening a tiffanys box
there is a ring inside it
she looks at ben almost in disbelief
boss can be heard barks fading in the distance
whats it look like
for which finger
whatever one you like
thats a nice one
why not put it on that
hes pointing to her ring finger
tamara is moved
penny upminister has managed to get boss on a bit of rope
she is handing him over to beth at the top of the field
those girls could have aborted
calm down penny
ill sort him out
nicholas is approaching
it beats me why you people want to live in the country
youve got no sense of responsibility
its not our dog
penny is suddenly all coy
youre looking great
what this old thing
you look like royalty
laughs delighted well i try
cant wait for your next book
inchcombes such a sauce pot
giles is always says what are you reading penny
youve got steam coming out of your ears
she laughs like a drain
nicholas joins in
beth is striding away with the dog infuriated
ben has put a ring on tamaras finger
so whats the ring saying ben
its saying hello im a ring
will you marry me
tamara looks at him searchingly
i didnt know
didnt know what
that you were in love with me
the ring says im platinum with a long guarantee
so give me a reply
tamara is grinning from ear to ear
youre the best fun in the world
id love to marry you
she throws her arms around his neck
can i say it then
i love you
tamara holds him profoundly affected
something akin to fear flickers across bens eyes
the phone rings
shes being proposed to
bens porsche skids to a halt music blaring
diggory is looking on in irate astonishment
the hat is on
there are writers here trying to write
beth is in the hen enclosure a hen in her arms
this is a buff orpington
shes looking a bit peaky today
not a great layer but shes very decorative
beth puts down the hen
were fully organic but i like to think that our champion product is the written word
nicholas approaches his hand held out heartily
the famous ben swipe eh
ben just about manages to shake it
thought the whole world knew that
it wasnt on newsnight no
ben is engaged to tamara
isnt that lovely
hed just popped the question when i rang
she said yes
nicholas cant hide his disbelief
ben is insulted
were delighted for you both
boss leaps up straining against a chain
whys he on a chain
he was out of control
howd you like to be chained up
he was chasing livestock
he couldve got shot
they shoot him ill fucking shoot them
he takes boss
beth and nicholas are left alone
i think the word is gobshite
i hope he makes her happy
its hard for girls when their dads walk out
gives them bad taste in men
whats that supposed to mean
just saying her father left when she was a girl and that is ten pence psychology
you dont know what youre talking about do you
he walks away
beth is completely taken aback
nicholas wearing a woolly hat and scarf is writing
patels eyes were open eloquent in death
he looks up
in the distance he can just see tamara talking to andy in the garden at winnards farm
nicholas opens his desk
he finds a pair of old binoculars
he focuses them on tamara
she holds out her hand with the ring on it
andy has his arms wrapped around himself his shoulders hunched
he nods affecting congratulations
nicholas tries to close in on tamara
but she turns and goes indoors
also the yellow porsche arrives
nicholas puts the binoculars down
he knelt down forensics be damned and closed her eyes forever
tamara is turning the ring around her finger
mai buff orpingtons
oh the written word
thats what the country does to you turns you into one
its a shame it doesnt fit
perhaps you should have taken one of mine with you when you went to buy it
yeah but i didnt know you then
when did you buy it
ben realises his mistake
tamara laughs shocked
was this for someone else
ben shrugs not wanting to admit
the truth dawns
you gave it to fran didnt you
its yours now
she never wore it
she didnt want it
you asked her to marry you
it was a gesture ok when she started seeing steve
look i love you now
tamara doesnt believe him
she is devastated
its not the ring that matters
i mean fuck the ring
its just a consumerist piece of zinc
what matters is i want to marry you
with my whole heart
and all the other stuff
like my brain and my entrails and my whatever pancreas
it all wants to marry you
he hugs her starts kissing her but tamara hardly responds
nicholas is staring out at the darkness
beth is organising things around him
she wondered if you had a delivery date in mind
i told her easterish
mind that cocoa its hot
across at winnards tamaras bedroom light comes on
for a moment she gazes out
nicholas gazes back
theres a few invites ill pop them there
just tick the ones you want to go to
ben wraps his arms lovingly around tamara
she draws the curtains as he pulls her away
and tim wants to know if youll do your christmas signing in hadditon
i know hes always ungrateful but i think its so important to keep these little bookshops open dont you
beth is on her way out
she turns and kisses him
come in soon my love
nicholas stares out into the darkness
he isnt working
he isnt doing anything
from the field nicholas is an ageing isolated figure in a tiny pool of light
mud frost and gloom add to the sense of neglect
jody is smoking
casey is eating pringles
they share a magazine
look at that cellulite
she been sitting on a bead car seat or what
casey turns a page
her latest tattoo count was nine including a sumatran tiger and eternity written in sanskrit
shell be getting a barcode done next
right across there
nice baby though
id like one that colour
jody chucks her fag end into the bin
the bin is on fire
casey chucks in the pringles box
they warm their hands watching one of the boys wheelie his bike and fall off right into a freezing puddle
what a dick
i think hes cute
no you dont
would you snog him
be like having a slug in your mouth
bens yellow porsche speeds right through the puddle further soaking ryan
ben and tamara are both wearing designer shades despite the gloom boss in the back
jody and casey are both on their feet in a second
ben gives them a grin and a wave
jodys heart soars
jody is outside the back door
she lifts a flowerpot and takes the key from underneath
she keeps this here for andy
what if shes got an alarm
soon find out
jody opens the door
they go in
the alarm is hanging off the wall the wires pulled out
jody grins at casey satisfied
what if they come back
if youre too chicken go home
the girls wander in awed
jody turns and grins her eyes like a cats
nicholas is doing a book signing
theres a good crowd
is that claire with an i
beth has a tray of mince pies
glen is at her side
what about you glen
where will you be
in london with a collection of spare academics
i guess well be decking the halls in our own erudite way
ill miss our chats
ive been in a state of writerly bliss these last weeks
i hope i get to come back
wed love to have you
glen doesnt want beth to move away
you know this is the best mince pie ive ever had
if it was possible to have an orgasm from mere food this mince pie would do it
she moves away
glen heads for the wine kicking himself
tamara and ben walk in
ben looks at the country casuals in undisguised horror
what the fuck are we doing here
its kind of research i want to write about them
theyre funny ben come on
they move through the crowd
the was the best
someone just bought my last three cases
so ive got her this gorgeous rajastani gagara skirt
arriving at the mulled wine
besides i want to show you off
what am i arm candy
more like arm fungus with that face on
ben meet glen
glen meet ben my fiance
youre getting married
beautiful dress magazine photoshoot everything the aspiring novelist needs
i knew youd be pleased
have a mince pie
can we get out of here
she abandons him
glen has turned away
ben stands amid the nice chat like a man being tortured
meanwhile tamara is jumping the queue at nicholas desk
in field of tares you made fred a corporal
but theres no such thing in the royal artillery
they call them bombardiers
oh thank you for that
she flashes a smile at the army geek and puts her copy down in front of nicholas
could you do it for ben
hes my fiance
were getting married in the summer
so i hear
you have my heartiest commiserations tara
he hands her the book dismissively
tamara is smarting
well merry christmas
she turns away
jody sniffs bens aftershave longingly
casey plucks his guitar
they listen to the note in hushed awe
jody puts her foot into one of tamaras killer stilettos
she picks up bens drumsticks and kisses them reverently
we gotta live the dream casey
live the dream
jody and casey jump up and down on the unmade bed
jody pulls a black t shirt from under a pillow
she holds it to her face
casey is looking out of the window
the yellow porsche is heading up the lane
a wild panic
they put things back where they found them
she nicks the t shirt
the girls sprint down the stairs and out
they dive behind a bush as the car pulls in
they lie on the ground splitting their sides with hushed laughter as ben and tamara disappear into the house
tamara and ben are having a heated discussion
why dont you sell it like you keep saying
ive started writing
you can write anywhere
but this is proper
not just stuff for the paper
its about my teens and is working for me here
well it might be memory lane for you but its doing my fucking head in
i want london
i want some urban ok
are you with me or what
cos ive had it with this place
tamara is hurt and deeply disappointed
of course im with you
and every time i look out of the window i see andys arse whats that about
andy is bending down the top of his arse peeking out in the morning sun
ben stares at it with distaste
andy is plucking a goose putting all his frustration into it
andy looks at him
tamara says you sell christmas geese
can i have one
andy smirks pointing at a big white duck
that ones spare
is that a goose
you can take it now if you like
oh come off it
its fucking alive
oh you want it from tesco all plucked and headless sitting on a bandage
bens curiosity gets the better of him
how dyou do it then
andy points towards an upturned traffic cone held in place by a metal frame
gently put its head down there then quick in the skull with an air rifle
pluck it while its warm little pot to catch all the blood do you enjoy doing that
no but in my low wage economy this flocks worth a lot
youre a sick fuck andy
andy has had enough
what did you say
hes at least two inches taller than ben
i said grow up little drummer boy
ben thinks about it
he walks away
glen appears with his suitcase on wheels containing most of his worldly goods
tamara rang me this morning
said to finish the house
it goes on the market in the spring and thats it over
why does the asshole always get the girl
he stands with andy comrades
andy slaps him on the back
or youll miss that train
snow falling outside
jody and casey are in school uniform
jody curled up on the bed casey at tamaras pc
the room has been redecorated
it wont be just a shag case
itll be an event
ill be wearing like a gossamer slip with a bra bit prada
or like a filmy linen shirt and
we see jodys thought bubble
ben is leaning against the door frame giving her a smouldering look
hell be wearing a black t shirt all taut over his buff bod and underneath calvin klein boxers black
jody moves towards ben
he buries his face in her neck as if hes found the love of his life
and hell have like one tattoo of my name and lush pecs and well have candles and white sheets and ill smell of allure by chanel
ben lifts jody on to the bed
they marvel at each other
he bends down to kiss her
and he tries to stop himself but im a vision and he gets drawn into my power and itll be like uhhh
but also respectful
and my v plates will melt into nothing
she looks up
casey is reading at the pc
are you listening
i like this
theres this bit right where her dad takes her for dinner and she thinks its some big treat but what hes doing right is telling her hes leaving them
and she right shes gutted and she yaks all her food into a napkin and puts it on his plate
its about her plastic fantastic
shes sad jode
shes a lucky cunt
outside the farm the snow falls
tamara is trying to write
ben is playing his drum kit high as a kite
the noise is deafening
tamara sits back looking around the boyish pad
it feels alien
the phone rings
andy is on the phone examining the decrepit shed
nothing has changed in a decade
so what about the shed
am i dismantling it or mending it
tamara takes the phone out onto the balcony to escape the noise
she slowly smiles knowing what hes thinking
i dont know the shed
what do you think
i recommend preserving it
always useful a good shed
andy puts the phone down grinning
tamara is grinning too sharing the same memory
beth is decorating a little pink valentine cake
shes on the phone to nicholas
yes we thought itd be a good opportunity to catch up
couldnt you do it another day
nicholas is standing by the window on his phone
beth you know what its like
judys off to new york tomorrow
we can never find a window

he puts the phone down
beth looks at the cake
it says to my valentine in piped lettering around the edge
she picks up her icing bag full of unease
in the middle of the cake she ices a big question mark
then she quickly looks up a number and dials
judy and nicholas are eating their starters
beth hello love
im so sorry i think nicholas has got his phone turned off and um hes right here
ill put him on
oh actually dont worry ive just found it
beth puts the phone down biting her lip
she is relieved ashamed and ultimately not reassured
she looks to camera
nicholas has been telling the truth a lot recently
the cake with its question mark is finished
roses are red violets are blue
jody dressed in tamaras leopard skin coat is admiring herself in tamaras mirror swigging from a bottle of wine
we hear casey reading the card
you are so fit i wanna shag you
love from ben pfwoor
jody takes another swig with a wicked grin she sits at tamaras pc
we hear casey knock three times on the back door
outside casey is waiting
jody lets her in
she has accessorised the leopard print coat with red stilettos a chloe bag and bright red lipstick

ben is reading the email looking angry and jealous
what the fuck is this
beth opens the email
come to winnards farm
andy is on the public computer looking completely puzzled
ill give you the biggest shagging of your life
beth starts utterly shocked
zoe is leaning over andys shoulder reading the email
she must want a foursome
ben is bashing away at his drums
boss is barking
tamara is trying to remonstrate with ben over the din
how many times
i didnt send it
are you listening to me
will he stops
he looks at her betrayed
why dont you believe me
i didnt write that email
explain it then
is this about fran
whats fran got to do with it
shes the reason you dont trust me
just because she fucked around on you it doesnt mean that i will
ben furious starts drumming again
tamara boiling with frustration walks away
tamara is on the phone at the far end of the flat
i wasnt pissed or depraved or andy is outside his shed
its ok its ok
the drumming leads up to a massive crescendo and stops
can you go to the farm
just take a look see if anyones been in
bens really pissed off
hes massively got the hump ben appears from the other end of the large room
got to go
she puts the phone down
ive just asked him to go and check over the farm are you thick
isnt it obvious who sent it
that tosser andy cobb
he wouldnt do that
making himself all cosy in your house
going through your stuff probly wearing your fucking pants no way
bet it was him that nicked my black t shirt
there is no way andy would do that
ben pulls his jacket on
well that says it all the way you leap to his defence
he hasnt done anything
you know what
i know fran fucked my best friend but at least she was straight with me
ben where are you going
he pushes her away harder than he meant to
she lands on the sofa shocked
im taking the dog for a crap
he grabs the lead and opens the door
it slams shut
tamaras dread overwhelms her
poppy is reading a print out of tamaras email
beth is folding sheets
oh come on mum
shes just stirring shit
tamaras always done that
whys your father on there and poor andy
its so tasteless
helping with the sheets you know how subversive she is
she once sent me a valentine from prince harry and i believed it
its her sense of humour she likes causing trouble
at school she used to give us first years tips on how to shoplift
she taught you to shoplift
mum shes marrying ben sergeant
why would she look at an old git like dad
nicholas is in the shadowy hall listening with interest
poppy helps beth upstairs with the laundry
nicholas steps into the kitchen
poppy has left the email on the table
nicholas picks it up deeply curious
nicholas is walking up the field wearing his red scarf
andy is outside his shed doing heavy work
what did you make of that email from tamara
it dont make any sense
her london boyfriends trying to fuck her up thats my theory
andy carries on working
she could do so much better
nicholas walks on
couldnt agree more
casey and jody are pouring over a gossip mag pictures of celebrity blonde with new man
how come shes with a different bloke every week and when lesley hunts sister shagged jeff dobson just once after he lied he loved her she gets called a dirty
pointing at the blonde thats cos she does it in five star resorts around the world and not the feathers carpark
over the page ben canoodling in a freezing park with fran
whos the daddy
steve culley and fran redmond recently announced they were expecting
but in a valentine tryst shocker fran is snapped with ex ben sergeant
ben and fran we say get a room
hes back with fran
after that email jode
tamaras car zooms past
her expression is black
what if shes dumped
tamara arrives outside her house
she remains in the car reluctant to go in to face her isolation
she looks at herself in the mirror
the face that stares back seems like that of a stranger
tamara is lying in bed with her brand new nose bandaged up
he face is covered in bruising
she is panicking experiencing a loss of self
the mask drops
all her old insecurities come back
she gets out of the car and slams the door unable to stand the sight of herself
she lets herself in
the inside of the house has been transformed by andy
the drab gloomy shades of her mother have gone replaced by warm tones which bring out the beauty of the house
tamara wanders through
she turns around taking it all in
she never knew the house was so beautiful
jody is weeping into her mobile phone
ill never see ben again
and its all my fault
jodys mum comes into the room
whats all your fault
putting the phone down none of your business
im bloody sick of you looking like a wet weekend
whatve you done
are you in trouble
leave me alone
you take care with boys jody
you know what can happen
what can happen
what can ever ever happen in a place like this
she throws herself on her duvet inconsolable
beth is with lucetta another writer crossing a field
lucetta raises her binoculars passes them to beth
are they crows or jackdaws
its so nice to get these little details right
ive got an unhappy wife and a newly qualified vet discovering a forbidden world of physical love in a bird hide
nicholass red scarf makes him visible from afar
nicholas sees tamara
he waits while she emerges from the copse
im looking for andy
hes not up at stonefield
tamara is about to turn back
so what about this shag ive been reading about
oh fuck off
i liked your email
well i didnt send it
and i wouldnt shag you if you were the last man left after a nuclear winter
ill come round tomorrow then
drop dead you smug prick
nicholas watches her storm back up the copse
tamaras car pulls up
jody and casey wheel around closer on their bikes
tamara tries the door
the pub is shut
she looks in through the glass and sees zoe up on the bar clinging to andy in a long embrace
tamara is frozen
andy kisses zoe long and tender
she gets back in her car trying to hide her distress which has taken her completely by surprise
jody and casey stare mutely as she drives away
andy and zoe finish their kiss
still time to change your mind
fun in the sun
just not a traveller zoe
youre like a big old tree
nicholas parks his x
as he gets out he is on the phone
ill probably stay on at the library for another hour or two
just checking some law reports
tamara is playing with the ill fitting ring that ben gave her
she puts it a jar and closes the lid
theres a knock on the front door
she startles her face falling
she answers it
nicholas is on the threshold
she lets the door fall open
she backs into the hall
nicholas walks in
he closes the door
they look at each other
neither of them moves
you can tell me to leave
tamara says nothing
you can throw me right out
nicholas slowly takes his red scarf and coat off
he hangs them on a coat hook bringing himself closer to her
just say and ill go
she still cant speak
nicholas takes her in his arms
he is big and fatherly and comforting
tamara feels a sense of relief of not being alone
her arms go around him
when he kisses her hes surprisingly real vulnerable even as if hes left his lordly persona at the door
tamara closes her eyes
their kisses become more urgent
tamara is lying in nicholas arms in the growing darkness
he looks blissfully post coital
tamara is gazing ahead
a tear rolls down her cheek
it lands on nicholas chest
are you crying
nicholas is taken aback
he instinctively holds her
am i really that bad
tamara shakes her head glad of him
im just not myself
yes you are
she looks up at him
youre relentlessly rudely uncompromisingly yourself
a smile appears on tamaras face
i used to watch you out of my window helping your daughter learn to skateboard up the lane
bit of an obvious crush wasnt it
is that why youre crying
am i here as revenge on your ex
i dont know why youre here
why are you here nicholas
since you climbed over that stile in the summer i havent thought about very much else
she doesnt believe him
you can use me in one of your books
nicholas is putting his coat on
tamara is uneasy
when can we do this again
what about beth
look beth and i have this kind of bullshit
isnt life complicated enough
nicholas shakes his head
he kisses her
nicholas strolls in
hes ecstatically happy
beth is getting something out of the aga
oh poor you was it awful
didnt move till well past chiswick
but look i nipped into fortnums
he hands her a package
all my favourite teas oh
he embraces her
he is affectionate magnanimous in his bliss
beth is taken aback by his warmth
you feel like my buzzy toothbrush just after ive charged it up
you should go up to london more often
maybe i will
nicholas goes to the table
the writers greet him as he sits
sorry everybody traffic was a pig
do carry on
im trying this magic realist bit at the end of chapter three where the characters slowly turn into that sounds very innovative
do you think so
its sort of the key to the structure which im thinking of as a nest shape
nicholas listens benevolently as lucetta shares
his good humour is so out of his recent character that beth watches him with increasing unease
there is something in her eyes akin to suspicion
beth is putting glens luggage into the boot
so after two years of radio silence i contact my editor
and she loves i mean loves the chapters i did in the fall
i tried writing at the library but i could feel that awful paralysis descending again
i missed everything that ive been you know finding here
seeing the view oh my god its so beautiful
they are now in the village driving down the main drag
im glad youve come back
a few solid weeks should holy cow
an egg hits the windscreen shot the same way as the earlier scene
casey and jody hide
beth gets out of the car to clean the window
lets egg the self regarding sacks of shit
glen is helping beth prepare the evening meal
they are both animated enjoying one anothers company
theres this theory he gave his wife syphilis right
no evidence but the symptoms fit
the poor woman gets kind of eccentric and moves her bed up to their attic the bastard meanwhile hardy falls in love with a woman who is thirty nine years
younger than him
i dont believe it
nicholas is passing through reading the independent
thats right a hardy book
nicholas returns to the paper
he gave his wife syphilis
beth is ashamed of his condescension
hes completely distracted
hes up and down to london all the time
the latest inchcombes taking everything hes got
nicholas is reading hunched over a computer
he glances round
tamara wearing a robe is awaiting his opinion
is it any good
because i keep shush
points at the screen this is brutally candid
you lay yourself completely bare
im well known for it
its very moving
tamara knows this is praise indeed
she is deeply gratified
have i done my duty
now do i get my treat
tamara almost in his arms is crestfallen
you are so cheesy
tamara is staring at him with something akin to distaste
jody and casey share a magazine and a spliff in the bus stop
zero ben sightings in two whole months
last time i saw plastic she looked like a minger all red eyed and gutted
bens a love rat
she should move on
shes probably topped herself
i would if ben dumped me
dont say that
what if shes done something
like got in the bath with her heated tongs
like taken a stack of pills
we see jodys thought bubble of tamara luridly dead her mouth coated with dried froth and vomit
dyou think she might be lying there all choked in vomit and drug froth
thatd be dire
if we find her well get in the papers
oh my god
rock chick dead at winnards farm
andy is outside the farm beside his landrover
he walks up to the front door
behind the railings the girls arrive
whats uncle andy doing here
hearing the knock tamara springs out of bed
nicholas spins into a panic
casey and jody are watching as andy waits
she could have been lying there days
she could be like putrid now like rancid oh no im gonna chuck like bloated and all greeny
and uncle andyll find her by the smell
tamara opens the door in some deshabille
to her surprise she sees andy on the threshold looking spruced up and handsome
the contrast with nicholas couldnt be more apparent
she finds herself genuinely pleased to see him
behind the railings the girls cant help their look of disappointment at seeing her alive
havent seen you for a while
thought you might be ill or something
or depressed or ive had my head down writing
come for a drink
lets lighten up
id love to but
shake off the winter blues
come celebrate the spring
im kind of on one with my writing
over her shoulder andy sees nicholas red scarf and coat hanging on the coat hook
he hides his shock
tamara is unaware that he has seen
can we do it soon though
id really like to just not right now
he nods at her in disbelief
he turns on his heels and goes
tamara closes the door
outside andy is leaning over his land rover sickened
dyou think hes in with a chance
id do him
jody hes my uncle
shed be mad not to have him i bet he goes a like a train
nicholas is creeping down the stairs
tamara is troubled
whats he doing here
he just came on the off chance
off chance of what
he wants to know about roofing for the shed
andys land rover roars away
im freezing my tits off
casey is looking back at tamaras door
tamara is peering out
nicholas joins her putting his coat on
he kisses her passionately
he wants to stay
shes insisting he leaves
the dirty cheating sod
tamara wanders in looking like shes trying to shake nicholas out of her hair
she sits full of apprehension
we see her fears beth in her apron pulling tamaras hair back and coming at her face with an electric hand held whisk
you fucking little slut
she puts her head in her hands
jody and casey have googled nicholas
they are outraged
prolific author of intelligent crime novels
fucking d list
how could she do that after ben
maybe shes numbing the pain
hes not even a proper celeb
maybe older guys know more
you know bed stuff
hes a perv
i hate him
jode i know who i feel sorry for
beth is walking to the post box
jody and casey are at the bus shelter gazing at her with keenest pity
how are you
jody nudges her
beth posts her mail
you waiting for the bus
bus got scrapped
so it did
hope it doesnt rain
she turns for home
gutted for her
fat arse though hasnt she
casey and jody stroll down a lonely lane
therell be the divorce and like acrimony and her worldll fall apart
but maybe one day shell put the bitterness behind her and find a new love
dont be daft
shes old you big sop
a parked x looms out of the mist
thats d lists car
so this is where he hides it when he goes to shag plastic
big old turd
hes a rotten cheater
like my dad
come on case
lets fuck him up
nicholas looks to see if the coast is clear then lets himself out
nicholas is striding purposefully back to his car with a smug post coital grin
then he sees that one of his tyres has been let down
he gets out his phone
jody and casey are in the trees watching satisfied
beth is on the phone preparing to cook
oh poor you
what a drag
tamara is half running down the track with a foot pump
the rooks are cawing
yes its a frightful bore
well ill hold off on the paella
tamara arrives breathless
nicholas signals her to keep quiet
she looks guilty anxious
youre a marvel
see you soon
the line goes dead
beth is disconcerted
glen walks in
beth could i use your printer
nicholas is on the motorway with a flat tyre
but i couldnt hear traffic
she snaps out of it
but she knows
did you ask me to read something
the tyres are done
nicholas is about to get in the car
nicholas someone knows
maybe we who cares
he kisses her passionately
she is troubled but eventually responds
jody nudges casey
casey pap them
casey holds out her mobile and takes a picture
then tamara extricates herself from his embrace
jody peers at caseys photo
a close up clinch
tamara dressed for a walk heads down the lane
she looks preoccupied
jody appears from behind the hedge
she heads for the door motioning casey to follow
jody is at the computer
casey is keeping a nervous watch
this is wrong jode
shes asking for it slut
im going to email d lists wife
we should send the photo and be done with it
jody suddenly startles
while i was sitting here
an e mail from ben come in
just like that when im here

and as its a cute little brown girl with curly black hair i think we can safely say its steven culleys and not mine

ben throws a treat lovingly at boss
boss catches it
big favour to ask

tamara doesnt deserve him case
she starts to type dear ben i cant see you as i am shagging an old married man whatre you doing
but i have found a reliable dog lover in the village
no way jody

casey tries to stop her pressing send
jody digs her nails into caseys hand
jody presses send

youre an idiot
im not having nothing to do with it
jody shouts over her from
otherwise my whole lifell go by and ill be washed up and thirty four like my mum and no one decent will ever even have snogged me
casey is leaving
fuck off then
nicholas is writing
theres the festival brochure
youre on in the lanson marquee
ive marked a few bits in case you want to read
beth hands him a hardback
youre a marvel
he kisses her and prepares to leave
she is suspicious
i could come with you
you hate festivals
but its only hadditon
its completely boring
youll hate it
her suspicion will stay silent no longer
have you got anything to tell me nicholas
nicholas attacks the best form of defence
god its like living with the effing moral police
are you ever going to trust me
nicholas drives through a huge puddle in his x splashing casey
he roars on oblivious
getting her mobile out right
glen is admiring his finished manuscript
beth is making sponge preoccupied but pleased at glens achievement
im doing this cake in celebration
glen holds up his mug of coffee
although i cant bear the man for what he did to his wife
andy comes in with an armful of logs
well things were different then
she had no choice
beths mobile bleeps
she picks it up
she couldnt just walk away
i mean whod put up with that now
beth drops the mixing bowl
she cannot speak
what is it
looking to andy how do i find out who sent this
andy takes the phone sees the photo
it says number withheld
he returns the phone
did you know
andy nods guiltily
beth acknowledges what this means
couldnt tell you
im sorry beth
glen looks at the photo nicholas and tamaras clinch
oh my god
this is just this is horrible
right under my nose
i feel sick
its so shitty so insulting
you do not deserve to be treated if youre kind to me ill cry
i dont want to cry
i must be very clear
if there is anything i can do
i have to do it myself
beths face cracks into distress
hey come on
i trod in the sponge mix
tamara is out on a walk
she approaches the shed sees andys landrover parked beside it
tamara smiles tentatively
how are you
andy says nothing
would you like to have that drink
i could do with a friend at the moment and you and nicholas hardiment
thats a nice piece of work isnt it
tamara is utterly dismayed
i get it from his point of view
hes always been a cheating wanker
he loves having his cake and eating it but since when did your standards drop so low
you could have anyone
all you have to do is bat your eyes
i care a lot about beth
she helped me out when i was at rock bottom
im not going to split them up
its a bit of fun
tamara is covered with shame
its none of your bloody business
i reckoned i could still see the blazing girl you used to be
i dont know who you are
she turns away her eyes stinging
boss is crapping on a verge
ben is on his phone
this is ben sergeant
jody falls off her bed
thats right yes
i love dogs
the crap is done
man and dog are back in the car
so ill meet you at winnards farm four thirty
ben zooms off
jody is haranguing with her mum
its a nice dog mum
well i dont like em
dog hair and slobber all over the place
but i said yes
no dogs no way and thats final
jody is devastated
i hate you
you want to jody slams her bedroom door
she stares at herself in the mirror
she steels herself
live the dream jody
tamara pulls nicholas into a quiet corner
andy cobb has rumbled us
has he told beth
i dont know
but he might
and i wouldnt blame him
well i suppose it has to come out sometime
its a good thing
feels like a relief
means you and i can start to think about our plans
for the future
i know its been hard sharing me with beth
but im yours now
im going to leave her
i want a new life and i want it now
tamara is appalled
a minder interrupts
during the interview tamara takes a seat at the end of the front row
the audience listens attentively
it all runs very smoothly
i start a book in the summer publish it the following spring
bit of a factory really
so youve just finished like the night inchcombes seventeenth adventure
are you already planning the next
there wont be a next one
frankly im sick to death of inchcombe
in fact im about to kill him off
theres a gust of dismay in the crowd as though a real death has been announced
thats a bombshell for your fans
all for tamara yes but im moving on to fresh pastures
inchcombe will be meeting a very sticky end
and its one murder im really looking forward to
how could you
this might be a good moment to take a few questions
yes the lady in the apron
you write a lot about adultery
is that from personal experience
tamara turns round
nicholas colour drains
beth is with glen close by glaring at him
he tries to make a joke
madam what a saucy question
why do you cheat persistently on your wife
nicholas considers whether he wants to be publicly humiliated
he decides not
because she lets me
beth takes this like a blow
even tamara is shocked by it
tamara is striding away from the marquee red with shame
nicholas is at her side almost jogging to keep up
its got to stop nicholas
i cant go on using her lying to her
wont be fun but ive got to do it
i dont feel alive with beth
i havent been living for years
shes had me smothered in a comfy blanket nicholas listen to me
she makes him look at her
we had fun
but its wrong
and its over
im in love with you
nicholas looks as if hes just been punched
you cant end it
tamara fuck supper
will you keep it down
my god youre cold hearted
please dont shout
you dont feel a thing do you
i do feel
i feel like im blazing away inside all the time
why do i do these things
what am i doing with you
the question hangs between them
theres someone else isnt there
oh for gods sake
not that narcissist drummer
its that ignorant lunk isnt it
that muscle bound wastrel andy cobb
andy cobb is a far better man than you
in saying it tamara realises its true
she walks away
nicholas bends almost double in pain letting out a great moan from the soul
a fan has been waiting at a respectful distance
nicholas numbly takes his book
instead of signing he tears it to pieces
he hands the tatters back to the fan
jody knocks on the door
she pushes it
its jody long
about the dog
she looks around
she heads up the stairs
jody enters tamaras bedroom
she stares at the bed
she runs her hand over the cotton percale
she puts on tamaras slip and looks at herself in the mirror
jody spins round
the door closes
ben is standing behind it
he is wearing a tight black t shirt the man of her dreams
i guessed you might be the somebody whos been getting in here pissing about sending e mails and fucking people up
dyou know what im saying
youve been breaking in
i didnt break in
used the key
found it under a pot
well for fucks sake
did you nick my t shirt
took it as a souvenir
jody is very scared
she is crying
creeping about in our stuff
what gives you the right
like i always wanted to meet you
just to tell you stuff
i love you
so thats nice
least someone does
i used to lie awake thinking about you being here
in ewedown the bumhole of nowhere
it was the best thing to happen ever
ive been so in love with you
and when you left i couldnt bear it
i thought the valentine would make you come back
dyou still love me jody
even though i wanna lock you up in a young offenders institution
jody nods unsure
what would you do for me then
would you do anything like a proper fan
jody looks at him scared
she manages a nod
ben approaches her
lets see then shall we
we see jodys phone flashing on the bed
what are you doing not fucking answering
casey is at the triangle leaving a message on jodys phone
boss is running round and round it
means ben must be casey suddenly realises where jody is
the dog runs off up the street
casey sets off towards winnards full of apprehension
beth is taking nicholas awards down and chucking them in a box
glen is trying to save them from smashing
i bet that bitch wants a baby
well shell find out nicholas doesnt do children
she is brandishing a diamond dagger award
hell leave it all up to her
thatll age her
but suppose he discovers fatherhood
they do these men second time round
they get all nappy happy
i was barely twenty when i got pregnant
ive never done anything
yes you have
look at this place
i hate him ive wasted my life
what about all the work you do here
baking fucking biscuits
glen holds her
when i was lost with my book you helped me more than you know
you asked who i was writing it for
he starts to really hold her
the sobbing subsides
he kisses her
beth looks at glen a revelation
the future opens up
she kisses him back
nicholas is standing in the doorway looking grey
may i speak with my wife
glen releases beth
you may not
she walks away
beth walks outside towards the chicken coup
nicholas pursues her
she sees boss running across the grounds chasing birds
thats ben sergeants dog
perhaps hes come to beat the shit out of you good
beth i finished it
shes been chasing me this wild crush theres something desperate about her something almost unhinged good god even when you try and tell the truth you lie
nicholas is falling apart
i want you to leave
i want a divorce
i want stonefield
and you go home
she throws a handful of chicken feed at him
boss runs away
beth storms off
nicholas looks profoundly shocked like a man who has just realised hes in danger of drowning
tamaras car pulls up outside
she gets out looking at the yellow porsche in complete disbelief
jody is shakily pouring a pot of tea
now put two sugars in and stir it
thats a decent cup
which is lucky jody cos if it had been shit id be on the phone to the extremely scary local cops right now
please dont tell my mum
i knew it was boring round here but for fucks sake
im gonna get out as soon as i can
going to work in vegas as a croupier
vegas or a cruise liner
aim high thats what i say
tamara lets herself in
she calls ben
youve had an infestation
jody shamefaced prepares to cough up
boss is lolloping round
the whole herd of cows is staring at him
boss regards the animals with curiosity
he wags his tail
will they play
he starts to bark
nicholas sees glen sitting on the edge of an old rusting trough
fury overwhelms him
i want a a word with you
its glen asshole
nicholas is stomping through the mud and cowshit
you fucking devious bastard
im a bastard
you think i havent noticed how youve been worming your way in
you keep your hands off my wife you low rent pedant
youve abused her long enough with your goddamn lies i want you out of my house
she made this place and i fucking pay for it
ive given beth all this
what can you give her
i can give her integrity
obscure literary shit not worth ten you know if i made my pile fantasizing rapes and homicides i wouldnt be so proud
glen grabs him round the middle
they struggle like overgrown schoolboys
bethll come to her senses
you need an income to run stonefield
and mines bigger than yours
glen nuts him
nicholas slips backwards in the mud
he whacks his skull on the sharp rusting corner of the trough
he falls to the ground
glen is astonished at his own prowess
get up nicholas
lets talk about this like grown men
blood trickles from the wound on nicholas head
oh my god
glen becomes aware of a sound like a drumbeat the drumming of hooves
the herd of cows come over the brow of the hill and down towards them
boss is chasing them barking
the beasts are terrified stampeding
they are heading straight for the trough
nicholas is trying to get up on his knees
glen puts out a hand to help him
but before nicholas notices he instinctively retrieves it
glen turns on his heels and runs terrified
he throws himself into the hedge as the cows thunder past
they disappear down the hill boss still behind them
glen looks back towards the water trough
nicholas is lying on his front his face pressed into the mud unmoving
glen walks over
he gingerly peers at him
the back of nicholas skull is broken open
blood is pooling in the mud and shit
he looks all around
has the accident been seen
no human is visible
has his part in it been noticed
he bends down as if to turn the body over in case by some miracle nicholas still lives
he cannot bring himself to touch him
fear overwhelms him
he runs away
tamara is looking at jody stunned
it was you
jody cant look her in the eye
jody has explained that she did it out of deep love for me
to bens astonishment tamara smiles
he grabs his moment
its an apology
tamara takes bens hand and leads him through to a dresser in the hall
she opens it
she takes the ring out of the jar and puts it in his hand
im in love with someone else
at that moment casey appears at the back door
jody the dog
boss is still worrying the herd
hes got them against a gate
the animals are very distressed
behind them we see andys landrover appear
andy gets out of his landrover takes out his rifle comes through the gate
loads his rifle while watching the dog
the dog and the cattle
he raises the gun
through his sights the dog
as his finger tightens on the trigger
a shot rings out
he looks round off right
up on the ridge of the hill penny upminster is standing in a straw hat and flowery wellies with a smoking gun
beth chucking fan mail into the bin stops in her tracks
tamaras head appears at the front door
beth is coming down the field where nicholas lies
she sees a figure in the distance
she squints the sun in her eyes
opposite her she sees tamara descending through the copse
tamara walking down by the trough discovers nicholas body
she drops to her knees light headed with shock
beth walks into the field
she sees tamara kneeling looking at something on the other side of the trough
tamara looks up
beth no brazen
that is brazen
beth carries on walking towards her
tamara is running towards beth
she cannot bear her to see
she throws her arms around her protecting her
it is too late
beth is seeing the corpse
a great wave of shock hits her
tamara holds her tight trying to contain it
another great wave of shock
her cries of grief soar over the valley
tamara ashen is on the phone to emergency services
youll get to it through byley farm
his skull is broken
no i havent but
yes she is
beth has turned nicholas over
she is washing the mud from his face with water from the trough
theyre on their way
beth seems totally closed off
tamara gingerly approaches
she touches beths shoulder
help is coming beth cannot bear to be touched
her hand involuntarily flies out
it slams into tamaras face
tamara steps back
her nose is broken pouring blood
she gasps riding the pain knowing she deserves it
its the biggest wake up call of her life
beth stares at her at first astonished at what she has done then satisfied
tamara stumbles away
tamara sits beside a dewpond gingerly washing the blood off her face
andy is watching
she turns away from him
she starts crying bitter tears
tam come on
it was an accident
still tamara cries
he comforts her
she lets him
he holds her for some time
id better get up to stonefield
come with me
well get this sorted
tamara shakes her head
she separates herself from him and stands
then get ben to take you to london
make sure he looks after you
tamara walks a few paces away
she stares straight ahead
i dont want to be with ben
she looks back at andy
he begins to understand
she walks off
glen sick with dread is drying his face with a towel
he picks up his muddy shoes and clothes wraps them in a bag and shoves them in his case
his eyes alight on his poster of thomas hardy
he pulls it down
ben and the girls have dug a grave for boss
casey is putting flowers on the top
ben starts to cry like a broken hearted little boy
jody instinctively puts her arms round him
the girls are immensely moved
jody looks over at casey
she pap me
casey waits until ben is not looking
then she takes pictures with her mobile phone
jody cradles ben in her arms doing her best moved but sultry pose
casey tries not to laugh
jody is ecstatic
the man of her dreams is in her arms
her wish has come true
an ambulance and two police cars are in the courtyard
the police are carrying the corpse covered in blankets
andy crosses the yard to the barn
he bumps into glen furtively coming out of the door
glens case is packed
what are you doing
glen cant look him in the eye
i figured id best you know take myself off
she doesnt want writers around the place now
and police autopsies not my thing you cant run away
im not running away
i just finished my book my time here is up
beth is asking for you
shes on her own over there
glen she doesnt need a writer around the place
she needs a man
beth is sitting still pale with shock her hands around a mug of tea
im so sorry
beth looks up at him despairingly
i mean of like foul play
it was my fault
i let the dog go
i shooed him away
the police said it was an accident but
it wasnt your fault
what i dont understand is why was he in that field anyway
he hated cows
and when they were coming why didnt he get out of their way
i have to tell you
for a moment confession and silence hang in the balance
glen opens his mouth to speak
you live in the country
you share it with those dangerous beasts
and when theyre scared they run
like we do
glen is full of horror at his lie
but beth is only grateful
stay with me
her eyes still red with grief are full of their future together
he will stay
he wants it all
beth leans into him seeking comfort
he puts his arms around her his face ashen with the weight of his secret
as he holds her he looks around the room
nicholas is everywhere glaring down at him from photographs
tamara is in the garden a strip on her nose
she sees andy in the dusk
hes leaning against the gate watching her
dont say anything
kind of suits you
and i always did like the old one
they are in each others arms
the embrace lasts and lasts
tamara is leading andy up to the house
you did it on purpose didnt you
made it so beautiful id never be able to leave
been dying to get rid of you
this is my house
i was born in that room
so you were
they are at the threshold
