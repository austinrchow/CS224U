href b b the sting second draft screenplay by a white on black title appears in the lower left hand corner of the screen its a bleak windy morning the
kind that clears the streets of all but the winos who carry their own heaters and the point men for juvenile gangs
we pick up a solitary figure joe mottola coming down the street and entering what appears to be an abandoned tenement
he pauses a second to dust his white winged alligator shoes on the back of his pants leg
sharply dressed and surrounded by the aura of one who is making money for the first time and broadcasting it on all bands he seems an incongruity in this part
we follow him up a flight of rickety stairs to a second floor flat
he knocks on the door is admitted by a cautious doorman
suddenly we are plunged into a room of chattering clamoring people
this is a spot for the numbers racket a place immune from legal interference where any sucker can bet on a number between and in the hope of getting the
to payoff that goes to those few who guess right
the bettors are queued up in several lines before a long table where they place their bets and are given receipts in return
others wait at a cashiers window to pick up previous earnings or to ask for credit
mottola moves through the crowd to a back room where betting slips are being sorted and money counted under the watchful and somewhat impatient gaze of a supervisor an older
man named mr
the yankee white sox game is heard on the radio in the background
mottola noticing that his entrance has aroused little interest saunters over to the phone girl and gives her a little pinch on the cheek
the girl slaps his hand away obviously having been through this before
beat it mottola
granger glances up and exchanges a token nod with mottola who plops down in a folding chair next to the radio
the phone rings
yes hold on a second
calling over to the supervisor mr
granger chicago on the line
granger is a little apprehensive about talking to chicago but takes the phone anyway
a flabby bald man named combs is on the other end of the line
visible beyond the door and interior window of his office is a large room cluttered with tables typewriters clerks and adding machines
this room is the clearinghouse for all the transaction of the numbers game
all the betting slips and income from the spots are brought in here and processed
granger this is combs
why havent we heard from ya
everybody else is in
we had a few problems with the law this morning
the mayor promised the jaycees to get tough on the rackets again so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good
nothing serious it just put us a little behind for the day
you been making your payoffs havent ya
he does this every year
theres nothing to worry about
okay finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can
i dont wanta be here all night
believe me the mans gonna be real happy
looks like we cleared over ten grand this week
not impressed we cleared here
well hell you got the whole chicago south side
how do ya expect the eight lousy spots ive got to compete with that
reading off a sheet of paper on his desk they did grand in evanston
is gary and in cicero
looks like youre bringing up the rear granger
granger burns inside
one of the girls whos been sorting and counting hands him a slip of paper
i just got the count
well put the take on the
well be waitin
combs hangs up smiling to himself proud of the way he gave the needle to granger
granger storming over to a safe and jerking open the door
mottola hustles out of his chair
handing him a bundle of bills take this up to the city on the
theyll be waitin for it at the clearing house
and dont stop for no drinks
you can get a cab down the street
mottola takes the money and slips it into his inside coat pocket with all the dramatic flair of the true flunky
no one would ever guess that he was just an overdressed messenger boy
mottola emerges from a side entrance into a narrow alley
he walks briskly down to the end and turns left into a large alleyway this one connecting two streets
the alley is deserted save for one scruffy slovenly dressed young stranger coming toward him from the opposite direction
the man carries a battered suitcase and seems to be in a hurry
suddenly mottola hears shouting coming from somewhere behind him
he turns around to see a small weathered looking thief come racing around the corner and down the alley toward him frantically pursued by a gray haired black man
limping noticeably the black man manages a few cries for help and then stumbles and falls
the stranger yells at mottola to cover his side of the alley and then readies himself for the arrival of the thief
mottola just stands there not the least interested in the exercise of justice
just as the thief is about to run on by the stranger throws his suitcase at the little mans legs sending him sprawling and separating him from the wallet hes
been carrying in his left hand
the stranger makes a dash for the wallet and kicks it back to where mottola is standing
almost by reflex mottola picks it up
the thief scrambles to his feet and starts back toward his new found enemy brandishing a knife
both the stranger and mottola brace themselves for an attack
the thief realizing that there are two people to fight begins to think better of it
he is not a young man nor particularly strong
shaking his fist at the stranger you fuckin nigger lover
ill get you for this someday sucker egg
mottola and the stranger exchange glances of relief as the thief flees out onto the street and disappears
the black man meanwhile has struggled to his feet and is staggering toward them
he collapses against the alley wall after a few steps
the stranger rushes over to him followed somewhat absently by mottola
you gotta go after him
hes got all the money
dont worry we got the wallet
he get ya with the knife
the stranger opens the black mans coat to reveal a bloody wound at the top of his leg
trying to move give it to me
i gotta know its all there
you just sit tight old man
were gonna have to get you to a doctor
starting to leave ill call a cop
no no cops
mottola has given him his wallet which the black man now opens disclosing a fat bundle of bills tied by a rubber band
mottola and the stranger are amazed by the amount of money
a little uneasy you wanted by the law or somethin
naw its okay
youre crazy carryin that kinda money in this neighborhood
no wonder you got hit
trying to get to his feet thanks
im obliged to ya but i gotta get goin
his leg gives way under him you aint goin nowhere on that leg

theres five thousand dollars there and heres a hundred for you
taking the bundle of bills from the black man plus the bill all right
ill make your drop for you old man
and dont worry you can trust me
mottola puts the bills in his inside coat pocket right next to the numbers money
the stranger who has now finished bandaging watches him do it
if that punk and his pals decide to search ya youll never fool em carryin it there
suddenly afraid again what do we do
you got a bag or somethin
how bout a handkerchief
the stranger goes into the right coat pocket and pulls out a wrinkled handkerchief
let me have the money
mottola takes out the black mans five grand and hands it to the stranger
he puts it in the handkerchief
you better stick that other in here too if you wanta keep it
pleading just hurry will ya
mottola pulls out the numbers money and puts it in the handkerchief too
the stranger ties it all up
demonstrating by slipping the bundle down into crotch all right
carry it down in your pants here
pulling it back out and tucking it in mottolas pants aint no hard guy in the world gonna frisk ya there
to the black man so long partner
dont worry everythings gonna be all right
the black man nods gratefully but theres still a trace of worry on his face
mottola trots off down the alley and out onto the street glancing around cautiously for signs of trouble
he walks hurriedly down the sidewalk toward the cab stand in the distance
suddenly the little man with the knife appears out of a doorway about yards behind him
mottola notices him and quickens his pace finally breaking into a dead run
we follow him as he dashes headlong down the street opening a big lead on the guy with the knife
he reaches the taxi zone
he hops in a cab and slams the door
he jumps in closes the door and breathes a sigh of relief
which way is mason
about blocks south
okay go north
the joliet station fast
mottola settles back in his seat and starts to laugh
whats so funny
i just made the worlds easiest five grand
he takes the bundle out from inside his pants in order to gaze upon his new found fortune
he unties the handkerchief
its full of toilet paper
mottola looks like hes just been shot
hightailing it down the street two newly solvent con artists on the lam
its hard to run theyre laughing so hard
the stranger chucks his suitcase in a trash can and pulls the real handkerchief out of his pants
jesus what a bundle
did you know he was that loaded
hell no i just cut into him
i woulda settled for pawning one of them shoes
as they split off music begins and we go into a done to a driving chicago blues the sequence is designed to establish somewhat the milieu of the stranger known
to friends and enemies alike as hooker
we see the following hooker is getting a radio and well worn suit out of hook
its like seeing old friends again
a shabby little place he rents above a cigar store
we pick him up in a jerry built outdoor shower which hes rigged up on the fire escape
the rinse water drips down through the landing into the grimy alley below
singing with plenty of money and you oo oo oh baby what i wouldnt do oo oo
jauntily carrying a magnum of champagne and some flowers obviously on his way to see someone special
hooker stands in the wings holding the flowers and champagne watching his date for the evening a stripper named crystal do her routine
crystal finishes up and comes off the stage
tired hi hooker you gettin married or somethin
come into a little dough
you wanna get outa here tonight
i got a oclock show
i need the five bucks
ill spend fifty on ya
crystal looks at him a second and starts to giggle
were pretty sure shes gonna get outa here tonight
little more than a reconverted brick basement the place contains three shoddy homemade roulette tables
hooker accompanied now by crystal nods a greeting to the doorman and proceeds to a table where there are already several other people laying their bets for the next spin
hooker knows the wheel man an old timer named jimmy
glad to see him hooker
how ya doin jimmy
collecting bets and paying off the winners aint seen you in months boy
thought maybe you took a fall
naw just a little hard times thats all
its all over now
you gonna have a go here
pointing to the betting board how bout a ten spot on the line here
the been lookin good today
lotsa action on th street down there too
as jimmy finishes his spiel he starts the wheel spinning and drops in the ball
betting is allowed to continue until the ball drops from the outer ring into the center
taking out his wallet three grand on the black
jimmy is stunned
the others at the table used to dollar bets look at hooker like hes some kind of foreign dignitary
worried you sure you wanna start off that big
bet like that could put a real dent in us
i feel lucky tonight
aw come on hooker why dont you just
three grand on the black jimmy
jimmy wants to argue some more but the ball is getting ready to drop into the center
we see jimmy quickly press a hidden lever under the table with his foot
the ball falls and settles into red with a motion that is not quite right
the others at the table fail to notice but hooker is not fooled
he stares venomously at jimmy who knows that hooker is on to him
making an attempt at levity in order to explain good thing that ball came up red
guy could get in trouble around here losin a bet that big
jimmy reaches for hookers money
hooker stops him by putting his hand on it
spin it again
jimmy doesnt know what the hell to do
he gives hooker a little head motion to indicate a small window high up in one of the walls
behind it we see a pair of eyes
suddenly hooker understands why jimmy had to cheat him but it doesnt change his demand
spin it anyway jimmy
jimmy is beside himself
if he doesnt spin again hooker may expose him
if he does spin and loses his management will fire him
he pleads to hooker with his eyes but its no use
jimmy spins the wheel and reluctantly drops in the ball
this time there is no foot on the lever and it settles into black
hooker stares at the ball a second and then looks up at his terrified friend
dont worry pal
i knew it was my night
hooker pushes the money over to jimmy and walks out of the room
hes lost but hes still working on a lucky night
hooker and crystal out on the street
irritated thanks for the evening hooker
i can still make the oclock
if you wanna spend bucks on me again mail it
she walks off down the street
going into his pocket for more money hey wait a minute
he comes up with aw the hell with ya
a late model ford roars up and screeches to a stop in front of the plant
out bursts a carefully groomed tight lipped young man named greer who hustles into the plant
we follow him through a maze of machinery to the service elevator and up to the third floor where we find ourselves in the clearinghouse room we saw earlier
the working day is over now and everyone has gone except for combs who sits somberly in his office
they found mottola
he was drunk in a dive in joliet
never got on the train
aggravated i dont wanta hear about his day greer
what happened to the money
he lost it to a coupla con artists on his way outa the spot
combs sits in quiet thought for a second
finally all right
better get on the phone to new york
see what the big mick wants to do about it
pause i gotta pretty good idea though
an agitated young man floyd weaves his way through the craps and roulette tables and hustles up a staircase to a second floor room with a drawing of a snarling
tiger on the door
below the tiger the word faro appears
there is a large man of thuggish demeanor guarding the door but floyd gives him a small hand signal and walks right by him
in the center is a beautifully carved wooden table on which sit a faro board and a dealing box tended by a stone faced dealer who calls the progress of
the game in a continuous abacus like device that keeps track of the cards which have already been played
on the opposite side of the table completely absorbed in the rhythmic appearance of the cards from the dealing box sits doyle lonnegan
although is clothes and accessories are those of a wealthy man there is a coarseness to both his movement and speech which bespeak lower class origins for which he now
has nothing but contempt
floyd enters the room and approaches him cautiously trying hard to make as little noise as possible
doyle can i see you a minute
not looking up from the table im busy floyd
we had a little trouble in chicago today
one of our runners got hit for grand
calmly which one
you sure he didnt just pocket it
no we checked his story with a tipster
he was cleaned by two grifters on th
they workin for anybody
i dont know
were runnin that down now
all right mark mottola up a little and put him on a bus
nothin fancy just enough to keep him from coming back
get some local people to take care of the other two
impassively we gotta discourage this kinda thing
hooker still in his suit but looking a little worse for wear knocks on the door of one of the apartments
a young black woman louise answers the door holding a baby
admiring hooker in his suit goddamn johnny hooker youre a sharp hunky in them linens
if you wasnt so pale ida sworn you had class
hooker steps inside and walks right into a big hug from an older black woman alva
alva has a hat on obviously just about to go out
beyond her we see the eirie kid and the black man known from here on as luther coleman playing a game of mah jong on the dining table with a
man whose back is to us
an year old boy is listening to the radio
turn that down leroy
oh johnny luther said you was somethin to see today
ill never be as good as that mark alva
well we gonna hear all about it when we get back from church
leroy get your jacket on boy
leroy goes to get his jacket
louise is finished putting the baby to bed
you goin to church now
they been havin late bingo down there
im gonna call on the lord for a little cash while hes still payin off
luther you look in on that child from time to time will ya
luther nods that he will
alva leroy and louise leave for church as hooker strolls over and tosses two packets on the table
luther doesnt pick his up but the other man does
we now see that he is the thief in the opening sequence
he is called the eirie kid and he is delighted at his share
hey luther told me he was carrying a wad but i didnt figure this much
which way did he do eirie
he was gonna take it all and run
laughs the bastard
he can blow his nose all the way
they laugh again but luther doesnt share their enthusiasm
he watches hooker who becomes uncomfortable under his gaze
where you been
flopping into a chair i had some appointments
not fooled how much did ya lose
after a pause all of it
pissed in one goddamn night
what are ya sprayin money around like that for
you coulda been nailed
i checked the place out
there werent no dicks in there
youre a con man and you blew it like a pimp
i didnt teach ya to be no pimp
whats eatin you
ive blown money before
no class grifter woulda done it thats all
you think my play is bad
i think its the best
hooker sinks back embarrassed that he misread colemans intentions
its the only reason i aint quit before now
im gettin too slow for this racket
i done the best im gonna do
you hang on too long you start embarrassin yourself
what are you talkin about
we just took off the biggest score weve ever had
we can do anything we want now
its nothin compared to what you could be makin on the big con
youre wastin your time workin street marks
you think im gonna run out on ya or somethin
just cause we hit it big
luther i owe you everything
if you hadnt taught me con i wouldnt know nothin
a little embarrassed aw hell you sound like some goddamn sucker
you know everything i know
you got nothin more to learn from me
but you played the big con
you said it was nothin
a game for flakes and mamas boys
and im tellin ya now youre a fool if you dont get into it
a bigger fool than i was
pause holding up the money i been lookin for this one all my life johnny
now i got a chance to step out at the top
hooker knows its no use
after a long silence what the hell you gonna do with yourself
aw i got a brother down in k
runs a freight outlet
i can go halfsies with em
it aint too exciting but its mostly legal
hooker just nods
straighten up kid
i wouldnt turn ya out if ya werent ready
flipping hooker a piece of paper i got a guy named henry gondorff i want you to look up
there aint a better insideman alive
hell teach ya everything ya gotta know
youll take a cut of what i make wont ya
im out johnny
if thats the way you want it
thats the way i want it
its late at night now
hooker and eirie wander along the street together not really ready to go home but with no other ideas either
hooker obviously preoccupied idly strikes a match on a street lamp as he passes and lets it burn out
he does this several times
how do you like that coleman huh
after three years
aw come on it was the only thing to do
he knew he was holdin ya back
we were partners
if it werent for luther id still be hustlin pinball down at gianellis
i dont need anything more than i got
you aint gonna have nothin if you dont lay off them games of chance
theres a depression on ya know
theres always a depression on
if you saved a little you wouldnt have to grift so much
i like griftin
you could buy yourself some things
clothes or a nice car
i dont look any good in clothes and i dont know how to drive
what else ya got to sell eirie
they walk on a few more feet when suddenly a police car pulls up alongside them and two men jump out
the first a uniformed policeman grabs eirie around the neck
hooker makes a break for it but the second figure a burly detective named snyder tackles him in the middle of the street drags him back into the alley and
plasters him up against a brick wall
the two have met before
hi there snyder
things a little slow down at the bunco department tonight eh
somebody lose the dominoes
you scored blood money today hooker
you need a friend
knocking snyders hand away aw find yourself a shoplifter to roll
snyder gives hooker a swift knee in the thigh and follows it with an elbow across the head
hooker flies into a row of boxes and garbage cans
getting up slowly you got the wrong guy pal
i been home with the flu all day
rising to a fuller height you can stake out my toilet if you want
snyder infuriated by hookers irreverence slams him to the ground again
the policeman is no longer holding eirie but is almost daring him to make a move
eirie wants to go to hookers aid but he knows the policeman will beat him to a pulp
pulling hooker out of the heap and smashing him against the wall again ill tell ya what you did smart boy
you tied into a loaded mark on th across from maxies
you and coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on th
if he hadnt been a numbers runner for doyle lonnegan it woulda been perfect
startled by the information youre crazy
im not stupid enough to play for rackets money
not intentionally maybe but that dont make no difference to lonnegan
hell swat you like any fly
ill square it with the fixer
nobody can buy you a prayer if i put the finger on ya
snyder lets go
hooker sinks back against the wall
he says nothing hes waiting for the price
i figure your end of the score was at least gees
i want no matter what it was
lying my end was only one
not taking the fake then youll have to come up with another grand somewhere
hooker is beat and he knows it
he reaches into his coat pulls out a stack of bills and counts out to snyder
eirie looks on in amazement he didnt think hooker had it
pocketing the money and motioning his partner to put his gun away youre a smart egg hooker
no use dyin for grand
snyder and his policeman friend get in their car and start down the street
hooker and eirie walk nonchalantly in the other direction
i thought you blew all your money
that stuff i gave him was counterfeit
theyll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it
snyder and his partner disappear around a corner
hooker suddenly takes off like a shot
he runs into a drugstore and goes to the phone booth
theres already a woman in it
hooker rips open the door and throws her out
hurriedly he begins to dial
standing outside the booth what the hell you gonna do when snyder rushes his finger right to lonnegan
youre committin suicide kid
waiting for the ring aw christ it doesnt make no difference now
if snyder knows about it so does everybody else
he never gets anything first
damn theres no answer at luthers
listen to me hooker
what ever you do dont go back to your place tonight dont go anyplace you usually go ya hear me
get outa town or somethin but
hooker still getting no answer slams the phone down and blasts out of the booth
eirie chases him frantically calling him to come back but hes giving away too many years and theres no stopping hooker at this point
pumping down the street
hooker races into luthers brownstone charges up to the third floor
hooker runs up through a small group of people on the stairs
he bursts into luthers room the door of which is already open
the room shows signs of a struggle a turned over chair a broken lamp but there is no coleman
hooker goes slowly to the window
he looks down into the courtyard and then suddenly sprints back out the door
as we hear him scrambling down the stairs the camera dollies to the window and looks out
there on the concrete below face down is the body of luther coleman
hooker races out to it and kneels down
shaking the body cmon luther get up
you gotta get up luther
in the distance sirens are heard
heads are out of the windows and some people are starting to gather in the courtyard
goddamn you luther will you get up
pounding on the body im not waitin for you luther
im not waitin anymore
get up you son of a bitch
goddamn you luther goddamn
the sirens are close now and hooker tears himself away from luther and runs
the others gather to look at the body
we open on hooker sleeping in some remote corner of the station covered with newspapers for warmth and barely distinguishable from the clutter of junk surrounding him
a station security officer on his morning sweep wanders by and delivers a terrific blow to the soles of hookers feet with a nightstick
hooker jolts awake with a cry of pain as the officer diffidently moves on toward another sleeping victim
tired and sore from his night in the station hooker struggles to his feet and attempts to take stock of the situation
he tries to smooth the wrinkles out of his suit but its futile
a quick check of his wallet finds it as empty as hed remembered it
hooker walks in and goes to the toy section
he looks through several small novelties till he finds what hes looking for a little tin replica of a policemans badge
he looks around for station detectives and seeing none slips the badge into his pocket
hooker rinses out his mouth towels off his face and slicks his hair back with water
its a drop in the bucket but it seems to revitalize him a little
we see hooker removing a sign from a door but the angle prohibits us from reading it
he drops the sign in a waste can and walks out into the crowded passenger lobby
after scanning the area carefully for a minute he goes up to a conservative young business man whos busy reading the schedule board
flashing open his wallet to reveal the little tin badge and then closing it again quickly excuse me sir
id like to ask you a few questions
flustered what for
i havent done anything
we dont doubt that but theres a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station
have you made any purchases here today
reluctantly yes a ticket to chicago
then im afraid well have to impound your money until were sure that its all good
can i see your wallet and your ticket please
handing them over but i got a train to make
taking out the money and returning the wallet itll only take minutes or so
you can pick it up at the window down the hall
but what about all these other people
blowing up well get em
give us a chance
im not the only agent in here ya know
we go around advertising ourselves how many counterfeiters do you think wed catch huh
pointing to his suit you think im wearin this rag here cause i like it
christ everybody thinks lifes a holiday or somethin when you got a badge
pouring it on i been here since three this morning charlie and i never knew there was so much ugliness in people
you try to help em and they spit on you
i shoulda let ya go and gotten yourself arrested for passin false notes
the businessman is totally shamed
im sorry really i am but my train leaves in ten minutes
all right ill give ya a break
pointing to a hall down that hall there theres an unmarked door on the left
go on in there and wait at the window
ill take this
he holds up the money in the back and run it through right away
well have you outta there in a couple minutes
you dont know how much i appreciate this
with a little wave think nothin of it
the man goes off down the hall more than grateful to be given a break like this
hooker heads for the back
we follow the man down the hall to the unmarked door
he strides on through to find himself face to face with a wall of busily flushing urinals
boarding the for chicago
the man wandering up and down the hall wondering how he could have missed that room
the street runs along side an elevated train track
we pick up hooker coming down the street eating a hot dog he bought with the money he just earned in the train station
he appears to be looking for an address referring every now and then to the piece of paper luther gave him the night before
finally he stops in front of an old three story building which contains a carousel on the bottom floors and what appear to be apartments on the third floor
he peers inside the big sliding glass doors and seeing no sign of life goes around to the side to look for a way in
a year old woman billie appears in her bathrobe on the second floor landing and descends the stairs to get the morning paper
shes eating an apple
although she has just gotten up and looks it she has the presence of one who is probably quite striking at other hours
the sight of hooker fazes her not at all
excuse me im looking for a guy named henry gondorff
you know him
starting back up the stairs no
luther coleman sent me
billie stops and comes back down the stairs
its the first time shes stopped chewing
checking him out you hooker
why didnt you say so
i thought maybe you was a copper or somethin
she goes to a side door and unlocks it
its the room in the back
he wasnt expecting you so soon though
hookers not quite sure what that means but theres something about billie that makes him know that you dont ask
hooker walks past the now motionless carousel to the room in the back and knocks on the door
he gives the door a little push and it swings open
the room inside if small and cluttered consisting of a bed a sink and a bathroom all covered by a layer of books dirty clothes and beer bottles
draped over a chair fully dressed but completely passed out is the one and only henry gondorff
to himself the great henry gondorff
water blasting out of the fixture
we see gondorff still fully clothed sitting in the bottom of the shower the spray streaming off his face
an imposing figure with deep set eyes and full beard he just sits there stoically looking like a soggy lumberjack
hooker sitting on the floor between the toilet and the sink watches listlessly
finally turn the goddamn thing off will ya
i can talk cant i
hooker makes no move to get up
gondorff struggles to his knees turns off the water and slumps back against the wall
the two men just look past each other a second
down in the bottom
glad to meet ya kid
youre a real horses ass
yeh luther said you could teach me something
i already know how to drink
gondorff wipes his face with his hand
his mood softens a little
quietly im sorry about luther
he was the best street worker i ever saw
he had you down as a big timer
aw i conned a senator from florida on a stocks deal
a real lop ear
he thought he was gonna take over general electric
some chantoozie woke him up though and he put the feds on me
you mean you blew it
pause luther didnt tell me you had a big mouth
he didnt tell me you was a fuck up either
gondorff looks at him coldly you played the big con since then
no i lammed it around for a while while things cooled off
philly denver baltimore nuthin towns
hookers disappointment is obvious
but dont kid yourself friend i still know how
hooker nods unconvinced
getting up from the floor and emptying the water out of his pockets you gonna stay for breakfast or do you already know how to eat
tired i picked something up on the way
sensing something lonnegan after you too
i dont know
havent seen anybody
you never do kid
we go to hooker
he hadnt thought of that
lonnegan in plus fours and argyles sits on a bench as other members of his foursome tee off
floyd comes up to him
we got word from chicago
they got one of the grifters last night
what about the other one
theyre still looking for him
whos got the contract
combs gave it to reilly and cole
they staked out the other guys place last night but he never showed
they figure maybe he skipped town
you wanna follow em up
lonnegan regards floyd patiently and then pats the bench beside him
floyd sits gingerly
you see the guy in the red sweater over there
we cut to one of lonnegans foursome a short squat little irishman in a red sweater
he was a good time friendly manner and a winning irish smile
we like him immediately
names danny mccoy
no neck mccoy we called him
runs a few protection rackets for carnello while hes waiting for something bigger to come along
me and danny been friends since we were six
take a good look at that face floyd cause if he ever finds out we let one lousy grifter beat us youll have to kill him and every other hood
in chicago whod like to do the same thing
you understand what im sayin
lonnegan is called to the tee by one of his foursome
he exchanges a friendly smile with mccoy and belts the ball down the fairway
gondorff dried off now and in a new set of clothes is pulling up the shades of the large facing windows of the carousel building
the morning light pours in illuminating fully for the first time the ornate merry go round and its massive oaken horses
hooker watches him go about his business
billie calls down from the mezzanine which surrounds the carousel
you feeling all right this morning henry
you mind opening the round a little early today
we got some business coming in before hours
gondorff waves okay
to hooker great little countess that billie
runs a good house up there too
one of the few left that luciano doesnt own
gondorff walks around on the carousel checking straps bearing and poles
hooker follows him
getting impatient gondorff you gonna teach me the big con or not
on his back checking underneath one of the horses you didnt act much like you wanted to learn it
i wanna play for lonnegan
getting up you know anything about him
exploding yeh he croaked luther
what else do i gotta know
gondorff just sits tight and waits for him to cool off
waving gondorff off embarrassed at his own outburst aw right he runs the numbers outta the south side
going over to start the machinery and a packing company a chain of savings and loans and half the politicians in chicago and new york
there aint a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya
ill take him anyway
whirling on him why
like steel cause i dont know enough about killin to kill him
its the right answer
gondorff didnt know it himself until now
you cant do it alone ya know
it takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make em look good
well get by without em
this isnt like playin winos on the street
you gotta do more than outrun the guy
incensed i never played for winos
going right on ignoring hookers remark you gotta keep lonnegans con even after you spent his money
and no matter how much you take from his hell get more
youre sacred of em arent ya
right down to my socks turkey
if ida been half as scared a that lop ear i wouldnt a fallen asleep on em
lonnegan might kill me but at least he wont bore me to death
then youll do it
if i can find a mob thatll risk it
but no matter what happens i dont want you comin back to me halfway through and sayin its not enough
cause its all you got
gondorff switches on the carousel and steps back to admire his handiwork
the carousel makes a grinding sound does a few lurches and stops cold
music begins and we are into a short detailing the arrival of the others three members of gondorffs mob
throughout gondorff wears the fedora hat which is his trademark
we begin with a tall good looking man kid twist making his way through the railway station
impeccably dressed and carrying a small suitcase he combs the terrain carefully with his eyes
finally he catches a glimpse of the thing hes been looking for
its gondorff standing by a newsstand
gondorff makes a quick snubbing motion on his nose as if flicking off a gnat
this is known among con men as the office
twist returns the sign with a barely discernible smile as he walks on by
con men rarely acknowledge each other openly in public but its obvious that these two are glad to see each other
hooker in having his hair cut and his nails manicured
gondorff gives instructions to the barber
hooker is modeling a new suit in front of a mirror
he doesnt look too pleased but gondorff peels out a bankroll anyway
a pair of white spats stepping off a bus
we follow them into a where we tilt up to reveal j
singleton the most flamboyant of the bunch
on his way to the check in desk he silently exchanges the office with gondorff who is sitting on a lounge reading the paper
hooker being shown into a small apartment room by an old woman
it consists of a bed a table and a sink
hooker nods his acceptance to the woman and gives her a bill
he takes another look around the room and decides to go out somewhere but first he wedges a small piece of paper between the door and the jamb about an
inch off the floor
we hold on a slight bespectacled teller eddie niles in the process of counting a large deposit
niles is all business if hes ever smiled no one knows about it
he glances up for a second and sees gondorff officing him from across the bank
without a word he shoves the money hes been counting back into the hands of a startled customer abruptly closes up his window flips his identification tag on the managers
desk and walks out of the bank
this room has obviously been relegated to the status of the storage room
it contains the water heater mops and brooms old bed springs etc
in the middle of the room a space has been cleared for a table around which are seated hooker gondorff niles singleton and twist
gondorff is in his t shirt but still wears his hat
kid twist is in a suit as usual
the room is illuminated by a single bare bulb hanging from the ceiling
showing hooker photographs of three men these are combs favorite torpedoes
riley and cole
we recognize riley and cole as the two guys who got into mottolas cab
they do most of the small jobs but lonnegan might not wanna use em on you cause theyre kinda messy
we go to hooker
hes real grateful
billie wearing an evening dress enters the room and begins gathering up the empty beer mugs on the table
we got reason to believe riley was the guy who hit luther
but if you see either one of these two find yourself a crowd or take em someplace you know you can handle em
but most of all let us know
if they got a hit on you we gotta fold up the con
youre too exposed
you got that
hooker nods but we know he hasnt really got that
you sure itll be one of these two
theyre just the only ones we know of
billie has finished gathering the mugs and leaves the room with them
we follow her down the hall and into the carousel music filters up from the arcade below
the room has a bar along one wall and the rest of the space is taken up by tables and couches
its a comfortable place but not opulent
some of the girls sit patiently on the couches others play canasta at the tables
most of the men are at the bar fortifying themselves for the task at hand
billie comes over to the bar
to the bartender set me up five more beers will ya danny
as danny goes to fill the mugs billies eyes fix on a man at the end of the bar
we move to reveal snyder intently scanning the room as if hed lost a dancing partner in the crush
not finding what he wants he comes down the bar to billie
you the owner here
flipping out his badge lieutenant snyder
joliet badge snyder
dont cut much up here
trying to ignore her remark im lookin for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap
thought he mighta come in here
dont think so
i know everybody in the place and i always bounce the lamsters
all right if i look around your lobby
no but youre welcome to a free beer before you go
billie grabs a bottle of beer pours some in a shot glass and pushes it over to snyder
he ignores the gesture
with controlled force i dont really need your permission
we go to billie
she knew that when he came in
the discussion continues
hooker a bit out of his depth here listens and stays silent
lonnegans a fast egg henry
hes not gonna sit still for a standard play
everybodyll sit still for somethin
what did ya find out about the train eddie
hes been taking the century limited outa new york on friday and getting in here early saturday morning
he usually stays a day to check on his policy operations and then flies back
wonder why he doesnt fly both ways
the porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars
minimum straight poker
last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left new york
fancies himself a gambler huh
lotta plungers ride that train just to play him
breaking into a smile see j
hes slowly down already
snyder has completed his inspection of the lobby and found nothing
danny meanwhile has set up the five beers on a tray
which way are the rooms
who told ya this guy was in here
i just know what kinda women he likes
im gonna check all the joyhouses till i find him
maybe i could help ya if ya told me his name
i think ill keep that to myself
which way are the rooms
right through there
but i wouldnt go in there if i were you
picks up the tray snidely what are ya gonna do call the cops
i dont have to
youll be bustin in on the chief of police just up the hall
she exits with the drinks snyder is stopped cold
he calls after her
keep your nose clean lady
he cant spend all his time here
billie comes over to gondorff and whispers in his ear while the others talk
his eyes flick momentarily to hooker
i think we ought to play him on the rag
its the tightest game we got and its not all over the papers yet
no good j
youre not gonna con stocks to a banker
lonnegans too smart for that
what are you going to do con the payoff to a gambler
twist is right
it wont work
gondorff has nodded to billie and now rejoins the conversation
she serves the others beer
well use the wire
never known a gambler who wouldnt like to beat the ponies
the wire is ten years outa date
thats why he wont know it
im not sure i know it
well give him the hook on the train and play him here
you think i can get in that poker game eddie
all you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool
i also gotta win
he looks at hooker
there is a challenge in their book
gondorff smiles broadly then casually to them all
by the way any of you guys been passing off any green goods lately
we go around the table
billie if that dick comes in again stall him till i can get a look at him
and let me pay ya for these beers
what are you talking about
its on the house
pulling out a bill naw i want ya to have this
he hitches up billies skirt and puts the bill in her garter
dont look at it till ya go to bed though or itll turn to paper
billie smiles and leaves the room
she walks halfway down the hall and stops
she cant wait
lifting up her skirt she finds that the five has indeed turned to paper
as she breaks into laughter and continues on down the hall we actually little more than a service area between two apartment buildings
niles kid twist and a middle aged black man named benny garfield enter the alley with an old man and follow him down a stairwell to a subterranean basement
a faded sign above the door says stenners billiards
we follow them inside to a an office comes off it at one end
judging from the fluorescent lights overhead and the scattered cue racks which still hang tenuously on the walls the place indeed used to be a pool hall
niles and garfield go all the way to the back while twist stays near the front with the old man
looks all right
its big enough and off the street
i dont know
this is kinda short notice
im not sure we can get it all done by saturday
gondorffs ridin the mark in from new york on the century
garfield thinks it over a little
hes taking another look at the place
we go to twist and the old man by the door
well take it
pointing through the door you manage the building at the end of the alley
with pride for fifteen years
ill need a room over there that faces this way
how much a week
only rents by the month
two hundred and fifty for the two of them
pulling out his wallet this is the last time i expect to see you down here
watching the bills being counted into his hand never heard of the place
we go back to niles and garfield
been a while since i stocked a wire store
not many mobs playing that anymore
all we need is the bookie setup for now
well worry about the telegraph office later
all right ill rent ya everything i got in the warehouse for two grand
thatll give ya phones cages blackboards and ticker gear
you supply the guys to move em
if you want a counter and bar thats another grand
i dont know where the hell im gonna get em though
cmon you can do better than that

you want the stuff tomorrow or dont ya
its gonna take hours just to clean it up
pause besides gondorffs still a hot item
where am i gonna be if he gets hit
just give us what ya can benny
well send a truck down
twist has rejoined them by now
to garfield you wanna work flat rate or percentage
whos the mark
we pick up doyle lonnegan accompanied by two bodyguards and floyd making his way through the station
he stops at a cigar counter to buy some cigarettes and we reveal gondorff and hooker sitting on their suitcases on the other side of the room
eyes fixed on lonnegan guy in the blue pinstripe and grey fedora
hooker looks and finally spots him in the crowd
we go back to lonnegan as he moves off from the cigar counter toward his train
hooker watches him with the intensity of one gazing on a religious object
hes not as tough as hed like to think
picking up his suitcase neither are we
lonnegan and his retainers getting on the train
two cars down the line we see hooker and gondorff boarding also
on his way in gordorff takes the conductor aside
i hear theres a friendly poker game on this train tonight
you know anything about that
you think you could get me in that game
i dont know
theres usually a waiting list
gondorff flashes a bill
loosening up a bit thatll get you first alternate sir
gondorff pulls out another fifty
taking the money ill see what i can do
kid twist enters and threads his way through the maze of tables to a door at the back of the building
a large bull of a man is stationed there obviously to discourage those who dont have credentials to enter
twist is not such a man
going right on through how ya doin lacey
innocently pleased for one so menacing good to see ya again twist
inside is another room this one much better lit than the outer one
there are only three tables in here around which are seated the elite of the con world
twist is enthusiastically greeted by duke boudreau a large rotund man whose stylish dress and authoritative manner mark him as a powerful figure in this group
when did you get back in town
coupla days ago
im workin a big one with gondorff on the north side
the two men sit down together apart from the others
listen duke were setting up a wire store
i need a twenty man boost right away
i got twenty or so in here tonight
take your pick
these guys have gotta be the quill duky
we cant afford to rank the joint
to one of his assistants get me the sheet jake
lets see whos in town
a silhouetted figure appears in the entrance doorway
the word chill races from table to table and the place falls still
the bartender pushes a button behind the bar and a buzzer goes off in the back room
boudreau gets up from his table and opens a small viewing port in the door
the silhouetted figure is now walking slowly past the silent tables
its snyder and hes checking out every face in the place
twist you know this guy
taking a look through the viewing port no
never saw him before
hes a dick though
snyder walks all the way to the back and then retraces his route
about halfway back he stops at one of the tables recognizing a grifter he knows
its the eirie kid
what are you doin up here
im on vacation
you seen your friend lately
yeh he packed it in and enrolled in detective school
snyder in no mood for jokes grabs eirie by the hair and slams his face into the table
eirie just stays there he knows it doesnt pay to assault a detective
twist is watching all this intently from the viewing port
you see him you tell him to pay his debts before i get him
eirie raises his head slowly but says nothing
there is a slight trickle of blood from his nose
snyder turns and walks slowly out of the bar
when he is a safe distance down the street the chatter and drinking resume
twist gives an all clear signal and returns to the table where he and boudreau were talking
boudreau reads from a list of names
twist listens with a certain preoccupation
hes still thinking about the little confrontation he just witnessed
paltrow sterling furey and the big alabama are in from new orleans
fiskin and the boone kid from denver and phillips barnett and limehouse chappie from new york
those and the guys outside should give ya or so to choose from
good have em down at stenners old pool hall before
were gonna run through the route tonight
okay twist but you know if this blows up i cant do ya no good downtown
gondorff is federal
dont worry about it pal
ripping through an open stretch between new york and chicago
singleton is walking down a passageway and stops at a door and goes in
gondorff is rapidly shuffling cards to four empty places
he is alone
he looks up as singleton enters
yeh i think so
i gave the kay ducer a c note
you find out the deck
he usually plays with a royal or a cadenza
handing him two sealed decks i got you one of each
he likes to cold deck low s or s
nice work j
singleton slips out as gondorff unpeels the packs
we pick up lonnegan coming out of his compartment flanked by only one bodyguard and floyd
he starts through the passenger section toward the compartment where the poker game will be held
suddenly a drunken woman comes staggering around the corner and bumps into him
they grapple a moment and lonnegan pushes her away in disgust
sloppy drunk keep your mitts off me ya big lug
if ida wanted you handlin me i woulda asked ya
lonnegan ignores her and proceeds down the passageway
as the woman proceeds in the other direction between passengers we see it is billie
she drops something on a seat beside a passenger
a hand reaches to pick it up
it is lonnegans wallet and it is hooker who picks it up
hooker waits a moment then stands and goes in the direction lonnegan has taken
he passes by the open door to the card room hesitating only slightly to hear the greetings exchanged inside before the door is shut
then he continues on into the next car
he turns into gondorffs compartment
gondorff is still practicing
he looks up as hooker enters and tosses him the wallet
she got him clean
he hasnt missed it
gondorff nods takes the money out counts it
looks like hes expecting a big night
he takes out his own wallet and puts the money in it and tosses the empty wallet back to hooker and resumes his shuffling and dealing
hooker sits back silently and watches him
hes waitin for you in the card room
let him wait
as he deals on the second pass he attempts to cut from the bottom muffs it completely and sprays half the deck on the table
hooker regards him steadily as he gathers them back up
gondorff finally meets his gaze
you just worry about your end kid
if we ever get to it
a specially outfitted compartment with a table and chairs in the middle and leather cushions around the outside for kibitzers
lonnegan and other players are already there and seated
theyre getting slightly impatient
to the conductor where the hell is this guy
i dont know
he said hed be here
gondorff is standing in front of the mirror dressing
he grabs up a clean white shirt and rumples it up in his hands
he then picks up a half full bottle of bourbon
hooker gives him a disapproving look
gondorff smiles and pats some on his face
everybodys itchy now
all right lets start without him
clemens give me the cards
the conductor hands him a sealed deck
as he begins to open it gordoff comes into the room coatless rumpled unshaven and looking slightly tipsy
the others at the table all men of high school or financial standing are somewhat put off
sorry im late boys
i was takin a crap
this bit of grossness does little to improve his image
making the introductions referring first to gondorff mr
shaw is a bookmaker from chicago
shaw meet mr
clayton from pittsburgh mr
jameson chicago mr
lonnegan new york and mr
gondorff nods and takes a seat none too gracefully
straight poker gentlemen
dollar minimum table stakes
we assume youre good for your debts
shuffling the cards mr
shaw we usually require a tie at this table
if you dont have one we can get ya one
yeh thatd be real nice of ya mr
he begins to deal obviously not pleased that his evening seems to be peopled with drunks
a truck is now parked at the end of the alley and several workmen are busy unloading it
one group carries a large blackboard others have boxes of glasses ash tray stands furniture etc
take several cuts
now a blaze of activity
we take several cuts of workmen papering the walls tacking down carpet putting in new light fixtures painting signs all under the supervision of niles
from now on we will refer to the pool hall as the store
back in the office kid twist is interviewing one by one a group of con men lined up outside the office door
a gray haired old buzzard curly jackson approaches the table which is serving twist as a desk
curly is practically in rags and has several days growth on his face
he wears a little beret which he takes off to address twist
names curly jackson
i worked for gad bryan outa baltimore
you ever played the wire curly
used to rope for it long ago
i can shill mark board anything you want
i dont run with riffraff and i only drink on weekends
affecting an english accent me specialty is an englishman
twist is taken with the man despite his appearance
all right curly youre in
we got a rack of suits over there
get yourself a nice tweed one
exiting thats all right
i got all my own stuff
gondorff and lonnegan have most of the chips
lonnegan is slightly ahead
gondorff has made a token attempt to wear the provided tie having tied it in a knot around his neck but not having bothered to put it under his collar
he has a shot glass and a bottle next to him from which he has been drinking heavily
he and lonnegan are the only ones left in this hand
throwing chips in raise
likewise see ya and raise three
more chips see and raise five
five and call
lonnegan lays down his hand a solid two pair
gondoroff turns out three tens
lonnegan is beat
tough luck lonnihan but thats what you get for playin with your head up your ass
couple more like that and we can all go to bed early huh boys
lonnegan burns and the boys have no comment
the work is still progressing
we see two workmen installing a ticket tape machine in a secluded area of the store
we bought ya a tap into moe anenbergs wire
hes got eyes at every track in the country
youll get race results odds scratches pole positions everything and just as fast as western union gets em
know how to use this thing
all hes gotta do is read
we go to kid twist still conducting interviews in the office
a young rather sullen man buck duff steps to the table
i was in maxwells boost in troy
you the duff that didnt come up with his end when little jeff was sent up
wasnt no problem a mine
he was a con man wasnt he
he was a tear off rat
he got what he deserved
no sense helpin pay his bills
like ice shove off duff
duff stands there a second and then slouches away from the table
he stops however by the door
the next man up is the eirie kid
twist knows hes seen him somewhere before
nervous as hell namess joe eirie
twist waits for more but its not coming
you played for any particular mobs
you know the wire at all
i never played no big con before
but luther coleman was a friend a mine
i thought maybe there was something i could do
pointing to eirie slightly swollen nose you get that nose in duke boudreaus tonight
eirie nods a reluctant yes
you got moxie eirie
get yourself a suit
eirie is so happy he can barely blurt out a thank you
buck duff enraged that twist would hire a total amateur turns in disgust and strides vengefully out of the store
the room is dense with smoke now and the players are feeling the heat
gondorff has his white shirt open revealing a stained t shirt underneath
the bottle next to him is almost empty
he sneezes and wipes his nose with the tie lonnegan gave him
the chips are now about equally divided between gondorff and lonnegan
the others are losing badly
throwing in his last few chips raise
two and call
jameson lays down two pair
gondorff has a flush
gondorff rakes in the chips which now put him ahead of lonnegan
well im out
dont worry about it pal
lemongan here wouldnta let you in the game if you werent a chump
getting to his feet ive had enough of your lip shaw
gondorff grabs the whiskey bottle next to him breaks it against the table and waves the jagged end in lonnegans face
barely able to stand up just take it easy there larrabee
jameson and the conductor step in between
lets take a break for a couple minutes and cool off
lonnegan storms out of the room followed by floyd and bodyguard
we pick up lonnegan coming down the passageway to enter the smoking room
to his assistant ive had it with that bum floyd
stack me a cooler
trying to settle him down youve only been playin three hours doyle
not to be pacified i dont care
load me a deck
set it up for threes and nines
ill cut it in on his deal
taking a deck and beginning to sort it what do ya want the others to get
they gotta be outa there early
im gonna bust that bastard in one play
a pair of hands shuffling
we pull back to reveal that theyre gondorffs
he passes the deck to lonnegan to be cut and turns to pen a new whiskey bottle
lonnegan takes the deck and in one lightning motion substitutes a new deck while making it look like hes cutting the old one
gondorff picks up the deck and begins to deal
as the hand is picked up we see that gondorff has four threes lonnegan four nines and everybody else has nothing
opening the bidding fold
gondorff looks at lonnegan very carefully for a second
lonnegan meets his stare
the spectators shift a little
its the biggest bet of the night
see and raise
taking it to him raise
lonnegan fingers his remaining chips
he knows hes won but he wants to bleed it for every bit of suspense
going for broke see and raise the rest
lonnegan pushes in the rest of his chips
gondorff who is only required to match lonnegans total throws in all his too
its a showdown
lonnegan puts down his four nines
gondorff just stares at them a second lets out a deep sigh and lays down four jacks
lonnegan is aghast
this just cant be
he glances at floyd who can do nothing but sit there with his mouth open
raking in the chips well thats all for me tonight boys
im gonna leave ya some cab fare
the other players look at each other in disgust and reach for their wallets all of which are well stocked
to lonnegan you owe me grand pal
lonnegan with a stare that could kill reaches for his wallet
suddenly the stare goes soft
he tries a few more pockets
getting up to get it i guess i left it in my room
blowing up what
dont give me that crap you little weenie
how do i know you aint gonna take a powder
waving his wallter which is full of lonnegans money you come to a game like this you bring your money
lonnegan having had all he can take goes for gondorff but is restrained by the conductor
all right buddy im gonna send a boy by your room in five minutes and you better have that jack or its gonna be all over chicago that your name
aint worth a dime
gondorff stalks out of the room
we pick him up coming down the passageway to his compartment
the drunkenness has vanished
we follow him into his cabin where hooker is waiting anxiously
howd ya do
modestly well we got some workin money anyway
gondorff tosses his winnings on the table
big smile okay kid youre on
but i gotta tell ya its a hard act to follow
lonnegan sits in a chair smoking obviously still upset
floyd paces in front of him
i know i give him four threes
we cant let him get away with that
what am i supposed to do
call him for cheating better than me
theres a knock at the door
floyd goes and opens it
my names carver
shaw sent me
floyd motions him in without a word
your boss is quite a card player carver
how does he do it
very matter of factly he cheats
lonnegan says nothing
he doesnt like smart asses
he looks hooker over a second as if considering whether to have him wasted or not
reaching into his coat pocket hell have to take a check
pulling out a check i couldnt find my wallet
yeh he knows that
startled what do you mean
pulling out lonnegans wallet and tossing it to him he hired a dame to take it from ya
lonnegan just holds the wallet
he cant believe it
you were set up lonnegan
shaws been planning to beat your game for months
he was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya
the heat rising i could have you put under this train for this errand boy
cool as hell so could shaw
then why the rat
cause im tired of bein his nigger
pause i want you to help me break him
lonnegan looks at hooker long and hard as if the intensity of his gaze could separate truth from fiction
lonnegan hadnt expected this but now that its here it better be on the level
the silence is suddenly broken by the noise of the train braking into the station
to hooker cmon ill give ya a lift home
hooker hesitates not sure whether to accept or not
whats the matter
you gotta get back to shaw
naw he picked up some jane in the bar
cant see him till morning anyway
all right then
driving through the city the driver and floyd in front hooker and lonnegan in back
hooker glances out the window from time to time just to make sure theyre really going to his place
shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from
i need somebody respectable
but not completely legit
what im gonna do isnt very legal
insulted im a banker friend
thats legit in this state
all you gotta do is place a bet for me at shaws place
ill supply all the money and the information
lonnegan is listening but youd never know it
if you help me out ill pay ya back the money you owe shaw myself
thats worth fifteen grand to ya
maybe a couple million
we go to lonnegan
hes still not talking but that last phrase has registered
the car pulls up in front of hookers place
youre dreamin kid
getting out marshall street
tomorrow at if youre interested
diffidently if im not there by quarter of im not coming
hooker nods and walks up the steps to his apartment building
lonnegans car speeds away from the curb and on out of sight
hooker breathes a sigh of relief
hes passed his first test or has he
we follow him up the stairs to his room
hes just about to unlock the door when he notices the little piece of paper he left in the door is on the floor
without the slightest hesitation hooker leaps over the bannister and races back down the stairs
two gunmen riley and cole burst out of his room and fire at him over the railing but hes already too far down
riley and cole give chase
riley and cole barrel out of the building and onto the sidewalk
there is an empty bus stopped at a light but they find no sign of hooker
as the light changes we cut to the other side of the bus where we see hooker crouched on the rear wheel housing hanging on to a vent
hes a little shaken but most of all hes still alive
we hold on him as the bus moves off
everything go all right
lying yeh it was easy
hooker and gondorff are sitting alone in the back office while the work goes on outside
their conversation continues
no signs of trouble
what do ya mean
you know somebody tailin ya
a torpedo or somethin
wanting to get off the subject no not a thing
gondorff has his doubts but lets them ride
we concentrate on some of the fine details i
garfield explaining how the ticker will read out to singleton and billie curly jackson showing a younger con man how to mark the odds board properly
how bout lonnegan
i gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to
he threatened to kill me
hell they dont do that and you know youre not gettin through to em
we concentrate on niles whos making up the boodles or fake bankrollls
he puts a real bill on the bottom then two inches of cut green paper on top and then another bill on top of that so that it looks like
he has a whole stack of bills
the bundle is then bound with a sealed label like those used in banks that says
we see that he has already made several of these bundles
then he drove me home
he tried to put himself away as legit so i went right into the pitch
did he hold you up on anything
naw he just sat there and listened
i dont know if he bought it or not
twist in the middle of the room giving a route to the eirie kid
he shows him where to get his drink at the bar where to sit and finally how to leap up and throw his racing form down in disgust
thats all right
once they start listening theyre in trouble
just dont give him more than he asks for
if you rattle his imagination a little hell come up with all the right answers himself
but all hes gotta do is catch you in one lie and youre dead
they both look tired
you think hell show
did he say he wouldnt
softly hell show
at first it appears to be deserted but we move to reveal a figure in an upper window of the apartment building which forms one side of the alley
its kid twist
his eyes roam the street for what we do not yet know
probably prosperous at one time it has since declined its large fountain and eating area bow host to two bums and hooker who sits alone in a rear booth near
dressed in a tuxedo he nurses a cup of coffee and anxiously alternates his glances between the clock and the empty street outside
the place is full of people although we avoid long shot so as not to give away the room as a whole yet
instead we concentrate on the tense waiting faces of some of the more familiar people gondorff and niles in tuxedos behind a barred cashiers area
gondorff mutilates a piece of gum in his mouth
niles just stares out into space cracking his knuckles
eddie cut that out will ya
the boardmarker walking nervously back and forth in front of his odds board checking every letter and number
he stops to cross a t on one of the horses names
it was already crossed but he does it again anyway
billie and singleton in an area hidden from the rest of the room watching the print out on the ticker machine
the clicking of the ticker is the only sound we hear in the store
curly jackson in front of a mirror pasting a fake van dyke on his chin to go with his tweed suit and monocle
a couple of billies girls adjusting their waitress outfits and primping their hair
each has a tray full of drinks beside her
the eirie kid silently retracing his route to make sure he has it down
despite the crowd there is no talking and little movement save for the constant swirling of smoke from several cigars and cigarettes
the group is like a theatre company waiting to go on opening night
its and hooker is worried
he looks up to see two large men obviously racket goons come in the front door and take a seat facing him in the next booth
they stare at him impassively waving the waitress away when she comes to take their order
hooker knows theyre lonnegans men but is somewhat unsettled by the fact that lonnegan is not with them
suddenly a voice
hooker turns around to find that lonnegan is seated in the booth directly behind him
his bodyguard is in the one behind that
you should always look to the back too kid
sliding out of his booth and into lonnegans i was afraid you werent gonna come
we havent got much time
curtly get on with it then
pointing to telephone sometime after a guys gonna call here and give you the name of a horse
pulling out a wad of bills all you do is take this two grand across the street to shaws place and bet it on that pony
theres nothin to it but dont take too much time
we only have or minutes after you get the call
youre not gonna break him with a bet
this is just a test
the big one comes later
be careful with that though its all i got
and you were gonna pay me back
i am after this race
lonnegan says nothing
hes not sure he likes a man whos stupid enough to bet his last dollar on a horse race
i gotta get back before shaw misses me
hooker hustles out across the street and into the alley
lonnegan watches him through the window and then settles back in his seat to wait for the phone
as hooker descends the stairwell into the store he gives kid twist the office
twist turns away from the window and looks at his watch
lonnegan waiting by the phone idly pinging a knife on the salt shaker
a man enters the store and walks over to use the phone
were waitin for a call
the man looks at lonnegan a second and then at his four goons
he decides maybe hell make the call later
kid twist again
billie enters the room with a piece of paper
kid twist looks at it a second and then picks up the pohne and begins to dial
hes getting impatient now and lights a cigarette and then the phone rings
he answers it quickly and we hear bluenote at to on the nose
the receiver clicks down at the other end
lonnegan hangs up and goes out the door followed by his entourage
we follow him across the street and into the alley where he signals one of the bodyguards to check the place out
kid twist pushes a button on his window sill and a buzzer goes off inside the store
the previously inert figures there spring to life
lonnegans bodyguard descends the stairwell and knocks at the door where he is greeted by hooker in the capacity of host
he looks the place over and motions an okay to lonnegan
as lonnegan enters we see the room for the first time in its entirety
overnight it has been transformed into a swank private club with bar cigarette girls upholstered furniture and chandeliers
look at that
hes got four apes with him
thats what i like about these guys j
they always got protection against things wed never do to em
everywhere there is activity
a bank of telephones buzzes incessantly
sheet writers scurry from phone to phone taking bets of tremendous size from prominent people
ruth on dancing cloud
we reveal that the phones are controlled by a master switch which one of the recruited con men operates from behind a partition
the boardmaker wearing headphones suspended from a sliding wire hurriedly chalks up races and odds on a huge blackboard
from the loudspeakers we hear the words last flash
the odds on bluenote settle down to to
lonnegan makes his way through the throng toward the betting line
his bodyguards fan out to various positions in the room
the betting crowd itself known as the boost consists of close to twenty people none of whom of course are what theyre pretending to be
there are brokers with pasty faces sportsmen tanned and casual and financiers with goatees and highly tailored clothes
large amounts of money are changing hands at the betting window
boodles are in sight everywhere
lonnegan slips into the betting line feeling somewhat estranged from the general merriment around him
there are two men in line ahead of him
the first curly jackson slaps down several bundles of cash in front of niles whos the cashier and places a bet on war eagle
gondorff appears at the cashiers window and catches sight of lonnegan
never get enough huh pal
id think youd get tired of losin honnigan
piercingly the name is lonnegan
to niles make sure you see cash from this guy eddie
hes got the name for bettin money he dont have
the man in front of lonnegan puts on dancing cloud
he makes the bet on credit
lonnegan steps to the window
two thousand on bluenote
writing out a ticket is that all
pissed thats all
bluenotes race is now up on the board
the race caller comes on the loudspeaker
ladies and gentlemen
this is arnold rowe your caller for the second race at belmont in new york
a mile and
four year olds and up
and theyre off
we see that the caller is singleton and that hes calling the race from a concealed booth next to the cashiers cage
around the first turn its a war eagle first by a length jail bate second by one and a half dancing cloud third by a half on the outside followed
by lucky lady mojo wits end and bluenote
lonnegan goes to the bar orders a drink and settles down at one of the tables
it happens to be the one the eirie kid is at
gondorff and niles watch it from the cashiers cage
worried thats not where we want him to sit
eirie tries to ignore lonnegan at first but realizes he better make some conversation
cmon war eagle
to lonnegan that dancing clouds a hell of a finisher
war eagles gonna have to open up a little more on em
you know anything about a horse named bluenote
naw hes never done much
probably in here just to round out the field
war eagles where you wanna have your money
eirie excuses himself and heads for the bar
into the clubhouse turn its war eagle by two lengths dancing cloud has moved up to second by a half lucky lady is third by three followed by jail bait
mojo bluenote and wits end
the heretofore chaotic energy of the parlor is now focused on the race
several of the patrons begin to yell for their horses
lonnegan remains seated
he seems bored with it all
hooker comes over to clear some empty glasses from his table
out of the corner of his mouth you really picked a winner kid
give em a little time
into the backstretch its war eagle still by a length dancing cloud closing on the inside is second by two lucky lady is third by one and a half followed
by bluenote jail bait wits end and mojo
lonnegan perks up just a little
bluenote at least has moved up
the rest of the people in the place are really rooting now
few of them remain seated
hooker arrives at the bar with the glasses he cleared from lonnegans table
eirie is already there fortifying himself with a scotch
youre doin great eirie
he loves ya
eirie nods somewhat unconvinced and heads bak to the table
into the far turn its dancing cloud now by half a length war eagle is second by two bluenote is third by a half and moving fast on the outside
lucky lady is fourth by four lengths followed by jail bait wits end and mojo
lonnegan is getting more intent now
coming down the stretch its dancing cloud by one length war eagle and bluenote are neck and neck by two
now its dancing cloud bluenote and war eagle
shouting now dancing cloud and bluenote head to head
the place is going crazy
even singleton is standing up to get the necessary excitement in his voice
dancing cloud bluenote
dancing cloud bluenote
its bluenote by a nose
dancing cloud is second by two war eagle third by three and a half
time for a mile and and seconds
most of the patrons collapse into their chairs like spent lovers
eirie slams his racing form to the floor
nobody had bluenote
tearing up his ticket bloody awful
who in blazes is bluenote
to eirie very self satisfied war eagles where you want to have your money huh
eirie doesnt reply
he cant believe bluenote won
lonnegan looks to hooker
hooker gives him a wink
for the first time lonnegan permits a smile
niles is counting out to him all of which gondorff won the night before
gondorff looks somewhat perturbed
lonnegan picks up the money and tauntingly waves it at him
getting his name right this time dont bother to come back with a pikers bet like that again lonnegan
we got a minimum here
to hooker show this bum out
hooker hesitates a second
go on ya goddamn ninny
gondorff gives hooker a hard shove in the back with his foot sending him into a table and sprawling to the floor
indicating lonnegans bodyguards and tell him not to bring his garbage men in here no more
this is a class joint
hooker pretending to be humiliated gets to his feet and escorts lonnegan to the door
lonnegan stops gives gondorff a derisive smile and walks out
once hes gone the general clatter and hubbub in the room cease like it had been turned off by a faucet
most of the boost sit down and relax
curly jackson rips off his van dyke
its been itching him
hes gaffed kid
he should start coming to you now
combs sits passively on the edge of his desk glancing across the room every now and then at riley who is slumped uneasily in a folding chair looking like a
defendant at the inquisition
both remain silent like two men in a waiting room
suddenly what theyve been waiting for arrives
lonnegan comes into the office flanked by his bodyguards
skipping the usual pleasantries he walks right over to riley
all right riley
what the hell happened
not looking at him we missed him
you werent hired to miss him
there wasnt any way he coulda known we was in there
we made a clean pick on the lock and didnt leave no footprints in the hall
somebody musta wised him up
yeh and what does cole say about that
i dont know
he took it hard
all right get outa here
youre outta work
riley gets up and drags himself out the door like a whipped dog
well put salino on it
i need somebody careful
why waste our best people on a small time job like this
it aint no heavy gee were after
the guys a five and dime grifter
then why aint he dead
they didnt think hed be so cagey thats all
theyll get him next time
itll take a little longer but there wont be any holes in it
combs gives up
the second times the charm
and tell cole i wanta see him when he gets in
hes not comin in
not to get bounced off a job anyway
he had his chance and all he did was shoot up a rooming house
made a lotte noise and woke up a few cops but didnt hit nothin
combs keeps his mouth shut
theres no way to talk to lonnegan when hes like this
cooling a little this is salinos job now vince
if cole wants to muscle in on it thats his business
but hes breakin the rules and when salino finds out about it i cant feel sorry for whats gonna happen to him
the finest the period had to offer
we pick up hooker coming down the hall to lonnegans suite
he is admitted by the bodyguard
lonnegan wearing a smoking jacket is seated at a table counting a pile of money
there are two other assistants standing behind him
they dont look friendly
well what did i tell ya
youre a lucky man all right
i could do it every day
why dont ya then
cause its better to do it all at once
leaning close were puttin down grand next week
at we make million
twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us
you got a system carver
you stayin in or not
drawing up a chair barely able to contain his enthusiasm its foolproof
we got a partner downtown runs the central office of the western union
race results from all over the country come in there and go right across his desk on their way to the bookies
all he does in hold them up a couple minutes until he can call us and get a bet down on the winner
then he releases the results to the bookies and we clean up on a race thats already been run
it cant miss unless the western union dicks get onto it
lonnegan is amazed
he sits back a second then comes forward again and pushes a pile of bills over to hooker
hooker smiles and begins to count the money
you got the grand yet
not yet but
stopping suddenly hey theres only a grand here
more like a command i think we oughta place another bet tomorrow
getting angry what is this
thats my money
you tryin to muscle me
controlled if your systems as foolproof as you say youll get even more
hookers in a jam and he knows it
after a pause i gotta talk to me partner first
we cant afford to expose our game too much
let me talk to him
you want your money back
try and get it in a court of law
softening a bit cmon dont be a sorehead
ill make it worth your while
migth even help ya finance the big play if this one works out
hooker says nothing for a minute and then reluctantly nods his head
four oclock tomorrow
pick me up at dewey lyles
we pick up hooker coming out of the hotel and going off down the street
as he does so we pull back all the way across the street and through the interior of a parked car to reveal the silhouette of a man seated at
we move to his right hand which rests on the steering column
its covered by a black glove and the middle finger is missing
his trigger finger however taps lightly on the wheel
one of the old wooden kind accordian doors with glass panes in the upper half
hooker dials rapidly
i told him the tale
he wants to see ya
all right when
stay inside ill come in and get ya
and be hard on him for a while hes talking money
hooker blows a mock kiss through the phone and hangs up
he turns to leave the booth when suddenly he sees something that stops him cold
there looking through the glass is the smirking face of detective synder
hooker is immobilized
snyder puts his hand inside his coat and slowly draws out his gun
he points it right at hookers face and then violently smashes all the glass in the upper half of the door with the barrel
fragments of glass spray into the booth a couple of which imbed themselves in hookers cheek
hooker quickly whips open the door trapping snyders hand in the accordian and jarring loose his gun
hooker sprints out of the booth as snyder scrambles for his pistol and gives pursuit
we follow the two men up alleys and sidestreets as they race through the dregs of the city two panting shadows moving through places that only get light at night
the wind blows drops of blood off hookers cheek as he runs
snyder still has his gun but would rather inflict pain than death
hooker makes for a condemned building and scrambles up the stairs steps giving way under him as he goes
on the fourth floor he ducks into a room and quickly locks the door
we pan the room to reveal that the whole back side of the building is gone
hooker runs toward the ledge and leaps through the air landing on the fire escape of an adjacent building some feet away
he kicks in a window and goes off down the hall
we cut back to snyder furiously kicking in the locked door
he finally crashes through only to find an empty room and a beautiful panorama of the city and its nearest hooverville
winding his way through the slum area of town dashing along backstreets over fences and through vacant lots making good his escape
from our angle he looks like a rat in a maze
why didnt you tell me about snyder before
i thought id lost him
hooker sits sullenly at the table
billie stands over him putting some ointment on his face to close the cuts
gondorff looks on
their discussion continues
well you found him again and were gonna have to do somethin about it
what else havent ya been tellin me
i told ya everything there is
then whyd ya move outa your room
it was too noisy
you cant play your friends like marks hooker
hooker doesnt reply
he knows gondorffs on to him
you know how easy itd be for one of lonnegans guys to nail you
all we need is a couple days henry
a couple days and well get lonnegan down and stomp on em
you just wont learn will ya
hell you come in here i teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know stuff most grifters couldnt do even if they knew it and all you wanna
do is run down a bullet
pause youre just like all them new jerks
lotsa nerve and no brains
and ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there wont be one gee left who knows the big con
was anything more than a way to make a livin
a couple days thats all im askin
i can stay clear that long
trying to be angry and failing christ theyll probably miss you and hit me
located across the street from hookers apartment building
hooker sits down alone in a booth with a plate of ham and eggs hes hardly touched
the two cuts on his face have pretty much stopped bleeding
a big fan above the counter area drones away lethargically its air stream insufficient to either cool the place or drive out the smell of onions and grease
a waitress loretta emerges from the kitchen and ambles slowly over to hookers table
slim and raven haired she manifests an indifference bred from years spent delivering things to people who are rarely grateful for what she brings
only a light scar on her left cheek hints at another side
yeh i guess i shoulda had the meat loaf
deadpan it isnt any better
wheres june today
figuring up the bill she dont work here no more
im fillin in for a couple days
till i can get a train outa here
where you goin
putting the check down and walking away i dont know
depends what train i get on
hooker looks for some sign that shes putting him on
he doesnt get it
he takes out some money drops it on the table and walks out
a truck with the words clayton bros
custom painting and decorating stenciled on the side is parked out front
two men wearing overalls and painters caps walk into the office to the reception counter we see that they are twist and singleton
to the receptionist excuse me
were here to paint mr
obviously not expecting them mr
hold on just a second
she goes to get mr
hooker is standing on the curb outside the diner obviously waiting for somebody
lonnegans car pulls up and hooker hops in the back
what happened to your face
had a little fight with a raggle down on th
she got me with her ring
harmon is looking over the authorization papers that twist and singleton have given him
he cant find anything wrong with it
brigham signed it all right
i cant understand why he didnt tell me
ah hes like all them supervisors
they think theyre too good for regular people
he says he was in here a while ago and the place was a mess
harmon looks around hoping its not true
well try and hurry so we dont keep you out of your office too long
why cant i work with you in there
look pal we gotta cover the floor the furniture everything so we dont spill on nothing
now if you wanta sit in there with a tarp over your head youre welcome to it
all right how long will you be
hour or two at the most
we do good work
harmon is resigned
twist and singleton pick up their gear and march into the office
once inside we notice that the office has an exit door which opens to an outside alley
twist immediately removes his overalls revealing the suit and tie hes wearing underneath
he takes out a picture of himself a woman and three small children and puts it on harmons desk replacing a similiar picture of harmons family
singleton meanwhile has spread a few tarps and begins to paint the walls
lonnegans car pulls up and stops across the street
well go to the side door
we follow hooker and lonnegan across the street to the side entrance which opens into hooker knocks and twist of course answers
les i got mr
lonnegan with me
he wants to see you a second
irritated what the hells the matter with you
we coulda met at a club or somethin
i thought it might be good for him to see the setup
hushed well we cant talk in here
theyre having the place painted
twist walks over to the intercom on his desk
he leaves the door open so that lonnegan can get a good look at the office twists picture in it the painter etc
lonnegans not missing any of it
talking into the intercom miss barnes im going home a little early today
tell anyone that calls that they can reach me here in the morning
harmons secretary at the other end of the intercom
harmon is with her
they look at each other a second and harmon decides he better see whats happening in his office
he opens the door to find it empty except for a pile of painting equipment and one haphazardly painted wall
dark and somewhat foreboding its peeling dragons and shoddy lanterns compete for space with the many slot machines and arcade games that line the walls
hooker lonnegan and twist sit at one of the more secluded tables
they are not eating
cant do it
therere telegraph inspectors all over the place
i got grand coming in from the coast and im not gonna blow it for a lousy gees
well get somebody else to do our betting
i could come up with grand in a day if i had a reason to
but who says you will
i got a guy i can depend on
hes liquidating everything he has for this
you wouldnt even give carver his money back
i need more proof thats all
anybody can get lucky once
stubbornly on a shot
the hell with ya
well keep the deal we got
if it works again tomorrow ill have a half million in cash here by noon the next day
feebly beginning to break we were getting from our guy
with coming off the top for me laying your bet
either way you end up with
a weeks a long time friend
anything can happen
all of it bad
hes right les
yeh and what if we play tomorrow and he doesnt come up with the money
we risk our whole operation for nothing
ill say when we make our bets
not if you want me to keep makin em for ya
and what do we know about your guy
he says a week but who knows if its a month
lonnegan heres a banker
he can get that dough with no questions asked
twist says nothing for a minute then all right
be at the booth at
ill give you all three places this time lonnegan
that better be proof enough
hooker and lonnegan smile at each other like life long friends
they get up to leave and we frame the shot with a coffee cup large in the foreground
as they go out the door a black gloved hand with four fingers enters the frame and puts a nickel down next to the cup
snyder finishes a donut and a cup of coffee puts down a dime for the lot and exits
we follow him down the street to a corner newsstand where he stops to buy a morning paper
as he peruses it hes approached by two large clean cut men in white skimmers
are you lieutenant william snyder
i dont know whats up
the captaind like a few words with ya
ya got a couple minutes
completely floored yeh sure
the two men show him to a waiting car
snyder stands in the middle of a dusty old machine room surrounded by four or five federal agents
visible around the room are several folding cots and portable lockers
the agents have obviously been quartered here temporarily
they all wear white skimmers save for one a portly man captain polk who paces the room smoking
there is something long suffering about him as if he wondered how he ever got in a service that thought white skimmers were classy
what is this
i got work to do
sit down and shut up will ya
try not to live up to all my expectations
not in the mood to screw around we were told you know a hustle artist named johnny hooker
snyder doesnt answer
do ya know him or dont ya
yeh but i dont know where he is
well we do
hes chummin around with a big c named henry gondorff
ring any bells
every bunco man in the country knows gondorff
theres word hes gonna run a con on the north side here
we got a year old florida warrant on him but its a thin beef and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold
all we want you to do is pick up hooker for us
why dont you pick him up yourself
cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin him
if word gets around that feds are in on it too gondorffll fold up the whole thing
wouldnt that be too bad
youd hafta move outa this nice office ya got
enraged dont crack wise to me flatfoot
i spent a lotta time in dumps like this eatin gondorffs dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin him off
but its not gonna happen this time
were not even gonna let the police know were here
if you keep your mouth shut and do a job therell be a promotion in it for ya
and you better take it cause i can make ya work for us without it
what the hell good is hooker to ya
hes gonna set up gondorff for us
hell never do it
self satisfied i think he will
lonnegan sits by the phone watching the clock and sipping a cup of coffee
specifically the small room from which singleton does his race broadcasts
singleton himself is hunched over the ticker machine reading the print out
billie sits at the microphone table with a pencil and pad ready to write
visitation is still up by two at the three quarters
single action second fasanella third
whats the line on visitation
checking further up on the print out sheet to
that aint bad
hell probably fall down
gondorff appears at the doorway
how ya doin
eyes still glued to the ticker nothin yet
i got a good one on the lead at hialeah but hes fadin
best we had was cats eye in the second at del mar and he was only
not many longshots comin in today
billie prepares to write on her pad
yeh go ahead
at the finish its single action by two fasanella second visitation third
reading up the sheet again line on single action
hell with it thats no good
billie crumples up the piece of paper shes been writing on and chucks it in a wastecan
we dont need big odds on this one j
take anything you get at or better
gondorff leaves the room as singleton turns back to his vigil at the ticker
a little weary okay the fairfield stakes at santa anita
mile and a quarter for year olds and up
everyone is in his place as before
today however curly jackson is playing the part of the aging sport
well scrubbed and clean shaven he cuts a dashing figure in his blue blazer and white pants
we go to gondorff in the cashiers cage
hes talking to niles whos busy handing out fake bankrolls to members of the boost
hes gonna hit ya with grand eddie
how much cash we got
not enough to cover a bet that big
get a couple extra guys in the line then
well give him the shut out
lonnegan is still waiting
he takes the grand out of his coat pocket and thumbs through it just to make sure its all there
singleton and billie at the ticker again
billie looks a little sleepy
singleton is obviously involved with the progress of a race
okay billie here we go
billie snaps to and prepares to write as singleton reads
at the wire its wrecking crew the winner by five grand theft second wingless third
reading up wrecking crew was
ripping the sheet out of the ticker thats our boy
billie and singleton hustle out of the room
we follow billie through the store and across the alley to the building from which twist keeps his lookout
gondorff holding the ticker sheet singleton has given him emerges from the office and starts giving instructions to the boost
all right furey your horse is wingless
paltrow the big alabama and phillipsll take grand theft
rodgers and eirie have wrecking crew
jackson his dandy cowan change of heart fiskin and chappie made to order
pointing to the eirie kid eirie he gets a bang outa seein you lose so we oughta use that on em
if you play the birds of a feather routine we worked on it should steam him up pretty good
you think you can handle that
a little nervous yeh sure
you guys in line take your time and i wanta see lotsa joy on wrecking crew
billie enters and gives twist the piece of paper she wrote the race results on
he picks up the phone and starts to dial
the phone rings and lonnegan answers it
wrecking crew at grand theft to place made to order to show
lonnegan smiles and hangs up the phone
lonnegans in line at the betting window
there are four people in front of him this time and they are moving rather slowly
the last flash call is heard on the speakers
getting impatient cmon lets hurry up there
the man at the head of the line turns around and gives lonnegan a chilling look as if he were beneath contempt
he puts down on grand theft
the next man in line plunges down on wrecking crew
just as lonnegan is about to step to the window gondorff gives a quick signal to singleton
the speakers come on
ladies and gentlemen this is arnold rowe your caller for the fairfield stakes at hollywood park in los angeles
a mile and for three year olds and up
and theyre off
counting out his money twenty thousand on wrecking crew
im sorry sir
we cant take bets after the race is started
he points to a sign above the window which says exactly that
lonnegan grabs up his money in disgust
dont take it so hard pal
you probably woulda lost it
lonnegan wanders over to the bar in a funk
and around the first turn its wrecking crew by a half length grand theft second by one his dandy is third by one half followed by change of heart back
flip made to order and high ground
the assembled patrons are once again thoroughly involved in the race
eirie comes up to lonnegan at the bar
who you got
half heartedly wrecking crew
maybe its our day
lonnegan nods and wanders away
hooker comes over to him
i didnt get the bet down in time
pissed oh jesus
gondorff and niles back in the office
looking out at the floor looks like hes sulking
if were lucky thisll bring him back stronger than ever
coming for home its wrecking crew by six lengths made to order is second by two and a half high ground is third by a length and grand theft is
coming fast on the rail
its wrecking crew made to order and grand theft
wrecking crew wins it by five lengths grand theft is second by a nose made to order is third by two
time for one and mile and seconds
eirie explodes in a joyous frenzy
he grabs lonnegan by the shoulders and shakes him
you hear that
you hear that
yeh lonnegan heard that
lonnegan shakes loose grabs his coat and heads for the door
he finds hooker waiting for him outside
tell your friend ill have the money here by post time tomorrow
well take the first race where the odds are or better
and make sure i can get to that window this time
how am i gonna do that
coarsely i dont know figure something out
lonnegan storms across the street to his waiting car and drives off
hooker relaxes into a smile
hes already figured something out
hooker sits at the counter finishing a plate of meat loaf
loretta is down at the cash register leaning on the counter looking idly out into space
hooker glances over at her every once in a while to see if she might be interested in striking up a little conversation
he finishes his meal and comes down to the register to pay his bill
meat loaf apple pie and a cup of coffee
ringing it up sixty five
hooker gives her a dollar
she goes to the register for change
what time you get off work here
you doin anything tonight
handing him his change yeh sleepin
hooker figures thats enough of that
he pockets his change and starts out the door when suddenly he stops short
across the street in a doorway is the silhouette of a man
hes pretending not to look at the diner but hooker isnt fooled
he goes back to loretta at the register
you got a back door to this place
whats wrong with the front
urgently now look i dont have time to fuck around

cracks of concern begin to appear in lorettas marble
what does this guy want
evenly hed like to kill me
loretta just looks at him a second
realizing that this is no joke she turns and walks slowly but steadily to the bathroom
hooker waits until shes out of sight
hooker goes to the front door and steps outside
cole looks up at the sound of the door
hooker makes a big show of spotting him and runs back into the diner
cole his cover blown draws his gun and races across the street in pursuit
arriving just in time to see hooker go into the bathroom he charges in after him only to find the place empty
he goes quickly from stall to stall on the chance that hooker might be hiding in one of them
he comes to one thats closed and seeing a pair of womans legs under the door rejects that and moves on to the next one
we cut inside the stall to reveal loretta sitting on the toilet with her skirt hiked up
right behind her crouched on the back of the seat is hooker
cole has finished his rapid inspection now and having found nothing looks around for hookers probable escape route
he sees the open window and climbs out to find himself in a small air shaft from which he knows hooker could not escape
hooker seizing the time bursts out of the stall and runs back out through the diner
cole sees him but too late to get off a shot
he climbs back in the window and gives chase
we pick up hooker barreling down the street with cole a hundred yards or so behind
hooker makes a sharp cut into an alley and we see immediately that its a hopeless dead end
inexplicably he makes no attempt to run back out
cole draws up and cuts into the alley anticipating the kill which should be easy now
he prepares to sight down his victim when suddenly he realizes there is no victim in sight
hooker miraculously has vanished
cole scans the alley frantically for some trace of him
there are no windows or doors at the street level
not even a drain pipe
just brick wall
hooker has disappeared into thin air
cole slams his gun into his shoulder holster with a curse and starts back out of the alley when all of a sudden he stops in utter terror
his mouth drops open and he chokes out the words salino hey look
i didnt mean to move in on
before anything else can come out two bullets rip into his chest
he falls to the concrete coming to rest on a manhole cover which we notice is slightly ajar
we beneath the manhole
we see hooker making his way through the slop having gained another reprieve but unaware that with two down there is still one to go
hooker comes in the front entrance and goes to the elevator one of the old fashioned kind with the iron grid on the inside
hes still a little rattled and waiting for the elevator is making him restless
it finally arrives and he steps inside closing the grid behind him
as he starts to push the button for his floor he realizes for the first time that hes not alone
he looks to the corner to find snyder holding a gun on him
this time theres not much doubt that hell use it if necessary
snyder brings hooker into the crate room where capt
polk and the other agents are waiting
polk as usual has his coat off revealing his shoulder holster
captain polk shoving a chair over to him have a seat
hooker remains standing
ignoring it drinking from a cup you want a drink or something
we want to talk to ya about henry gondorff
dont think i know him
well give yourself a couple seconds crumb
you wouldnt wanna lie to me
snyder here says you done a lotta griftin in this town
snyder doesnt know shit
polk almost laughs but he checks it
you got nothin on me
well get it and if we cant well just make it up
grand larceny extortion
with special emphasis counterfeiting anything you want
hooker says nothing but its not from defiance now
hes beginning to get the picture
look i got nothin against you but youre in trouble here
all you gotta do is tell us when gondorffs gonna play his chump
we come in at the sting make the pinch and you walk out free as a bird
no questions no court appearance nothing
youve already done time twice and judges dont like three time losers
you wanna sit in the can for forty years startin tonight
ill make parole
you wont even get a review till youre seventy
and if the board starts to go soft well let ya out in the yard some night with a hard nose young bull wholl put fifty slugs in your face
and ask what you were doin there later
hooker wants to come back with something but cant find it
dont be a sap kid
you could save us a little trouble
but henry gondorff is through whether you help us or not
theres nothin left to do now but save yourself
hookers thoroughly whipped
he sits down for the first time
softly will you wait until the chump is played
we dont care about the mark
he deserves what he gets
with heat i mean completely played
until hes beat and the score is taken
you come in before we beat him and ill kill him
youll have a tough time explaining that wont ya
all right hooker but you take it on the lam and well shoot you down on sight
barely audible just as long as i get to finish the play
gondorff and hooker are playing gin rummy and drinking
gondorff makes little comments as he plays but hooker is quiet and withdrawn
the carousel is not in operation and a heavy silence hangs over the place
whats the matter kid
youre not sayin much
just a little nervous thats all
luther always told me to bite my toenails when i get nervous
you see yourself doin that and you realize it aint worth it
hooker smiles feebly
billie appears at the door
things are a little slow tonight henry
i wanna open the round for the girls
gondorff takes out a set of keys and tosses them to her
she leaves to go start the merry go round
gondorff settles back into the game
take it easy you wont lose him now
we had him years ago when he decided to be somebody
believe me ive seen enough to know
softly how many guys you conned in your life henry
two or three hundred i guess
sometimes played two a day when i was in sheas mob
we had it down to a business
pause course chicago was a right town then
the fix was in
the dicks took their end without a beef
all the wall street boys wanted to make investments for us
even had marks looking us up thinkin they could beat the game
pause yeh kid it really stunk
no sense in bein a grifter if its the same as bein a citizen
gondorff chucks his cards on the table
hes through for the night
i better do some packin
im gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow
then why you doin it
seems worthwhile doesnt it
maybe its just for the cave in on lonnegans face when we put in the sting
thats good enough
hooker gets up to leave
apologetically i appreciate your stickin your neck out
i wouldnt have asked ya if it werent for luther
aint nothin gonna make up for luther kid
pause revenge is for suckers
i been griftin years and never got any
hooker just nods and walks out the door
we follow him past the carousel which is now full of giggling prostitutes in various stages of undress
their childish frolicking is charming from a group usually so jaded but its lost on hooker tonight
its late now and the street is deserted save for an occasional derelict or streetwalker on her way home from a nights work
we pick up hooker coming down the street toward his apartment building
he walks slowly almost reluctantly as if he didnt care whether he ever got there or not
as he nears his building he notices loretta coming out of the diner across the street
he stops and watches as she looks up and disappears into an adjacent building that advertises rooms for rent
after a few seconds we see a light come on in one of its second story windows
hooker just stands there a second debating with himself trying to figure out a reason for doing what hes going to do anyway
we follow him across the street to lorettas building and he goes up the stairs to the room where the light came on
he passes a couple of derelicts on the way
he knocks twice and loretta answers in her bathrobe
she is more than a little startled to see him
looks like he missed ya
yeh this time anyway
loretta notices an old busybody peeping out at them from her room across the hall
good night mrs
hillard quickly closes her door
shuffling a little i ah
thought you might wanna come out for a while
maybe have a drink or somethin
you move right along dont ya
with more innocence than confidence i dont mean nothin by it
i just dont know many regular girls thats all
and you expect me to come over just like that
if i expected somethin i wouldnt be still standin out here in the hall
loretta looks at him carefully
she knows its not a line
with less resistance now i dont even know you
slowly you know me
im just like you
its two in the morning and i dont know nobody
the two just stand there in silence a second
theres nothing more to say
she stands back and lets him in
a record spinning lazily on an old phonograph
we hear robert johnsons come on in my kitchen
gondorff is sitting up in bed with his hat on lost in thought
billie is curled up asleep next to him
theres a packed suitcase next to the bed
billie wakes up and turns over a second
cmon henry knock off
youve done everything you can
gondorff nods his agreement like a zombie and goes right on thinking
hooker and loretta are asleep against each other their bodies illuminated every few seconds by the light from a neon sign across the street
we dolly to the window and move in on another window in the building next door
theres no light on in it but we can discern the basic outline of a face behind the curtains which are slightly parted to afford a view of hookers room
by a black gloved hand
i said come on in my kitchen cause its gonna be rainin outdoors
we open on hooker in bed the morning sun streaming in on his face
he awakens slowly looks at the ceiling for a second and remembering last night turns to the side to find that loretta is no longer there
still drowsy he gets out of bed and looks around the room for a note or some evidence of her continued presence
he opens an empty closet then opens empty drawers
finding nothing he suddenly hits on another possibility and looks in his wallet
the money is still there
almost disappointed he slumps down in a chair as the harsh reality of what will happen this day floods back in on him
music begins and we we see the black gloved hand opening a small wooden box
wrapped inside is a shiny black revolver at this point in two pieces
the hand reaches in and takes them out
hooker is poking at a plate of waffles and sausage
the waitress on duty is not loretta and hooker has noticed
gondorff is standing in front of the bathroom mirror putting on his tuxedo
he goes to his dresser pulls out a very small gun and tucks it in his cummerbund
the hand swirls a pipe cleaner inside the barrel of the revolver and picks some lint out of the chamber
he then screws the barrel onto the body
this is all seen in closeup
hooker now has his tuxedo on
he takes two small rubber bladders out of a drawer and puts them in his pocket
lonnegan paces nervously around the room looking at the clock
obviously waiting for something hes getting extremely impatient
we watch the hand carefully loading bullets into the chamber of the revolver
gondorff emerges from his room carrying his suitcase
he stops and looks up at the mezzanine where billie is standing
they smile sadly at each other and give a simple wave having done this too many times to get sentimental about it now
gondorff walks out of the building
hooker is busily stuffing all his possessions in a paper bag lumping clothes with food records and toilet articles
lonnegan goes to the door to admit floyd and two assistants one of whom carries a large brief case
lonnegan takes the brief case to a table and opens it
inside is a half million dollars in cash
we see the hand putting a silencer on the revolver
the gunman puts the revolver up to his eye to check the alignment and for the first time we see the face that goes with the hand
it is fully as menacing as we had imagined broad flat nose thick cracked lips narrow eyes and cauliflower ears
hooker is on the phone now
we see that hes talking to captain polk
snyder listens also
hooker finishes the conversation hangs up and goes to take one last look at himself in the mirror
finding everything in order he grabs up his sack of possessions and leaves the room
we pick him up emerging from the building and follow him around the corner to a secluded alley which he generally takes on his way to the store
as he walks along he notices loretta coming toward him from the other end
shes wearing a coat obviously on her way somewhere
as she comes closer we move to reveal the gunman appearing suddenly in the alley behind and to the right of hooker
the gunman quickly takes out his revolver braces it in the crook of his hand and takes careful aim
loretta sees him
the gunman fires
loretta falls dead on the asphalt
hooker spins around in confusion
the gunman moves quickly toward him
hooker starts to back up but the gunman stops when he gets to loretta
he kicks her over to reveal a gun under her body
she was gonna kill ya kid
hooker is stunned
he cant believe it
dragging the body over behind a trash can her names loretta salino
lonnegans people set her up in the diner
cmon lets get outa here
hooker wants to stay and try to figure it all out but the gunman drags him away
polk snyder and several federal agents are busy putting on their shoulder holsters and checking their weapons
to snyder whoever gondorffs playin for is bound to be a wheel
as soon as were inside i want you to get the guy outa there as fast as possible before the reporters show up
we cant afford to embarrass any big shots
lonnegan carrying the brief case personally is seen getting into his limousine
four assistants get in with him
gondorff enters the store carrying his suitcase
several of the boost are already there
gondorff clasps his hands to generate a little enthusiasm
hes obviously up for this one
hooker sits in the back seat with the gunman right next to him
hes still very uneasy with this man
she coulda killed me last night
too many people coulda seen ya go in her room
she was a professional
used to work in the dutch schultz gang
who are you
gondorff asked me to look after ya
how do i know youre tellin the truth
dont have much choice do ya
we go to hooker
no he doesnt
we pick up polk snyder and the other federal agents coming out of the warehouse in their white skimmers and piling into cars
niles is busily spreading boodles all over the cashiers area
singleton checks his microphone
it works fine
he checks it again
he holds the brief case in his lap his fingers tapping lightly on it
hooker and the gunman enter and go over to gondorff who breaks into a wide smile
hooker returns it halfheartedly still ill at ease about what has happened
there are four or five driving in a column
snyder and polk ride together in the back of the lead car
lonnegans limousine pulls up outside and the bodyguards pile out
gondorff hooker and the others waiting the tension expressed in their faces
lonnegan sits tensely in the usual booth
he keeps both hands firmly planted on the brief case
the phone rings and lonnegan goes to it
place it on syphon at
lonnegan hangs up with the look of the financial killer
eight to one odds is more than even he could have hoped for
we follow lonnegan across the street and into the store
the bodyguards remain outside
the store is buzzing with activity
money and booze are everywhere
the sheet writer and the boardmarker can hardly keep up with the action
lonnegan walks quickly to the betting line and finds to his relief that theres only one man ahead of him
the man puts on kings image
lonnegan steps to the window swings up the brief case and opens it for niles to see
straight faced five hundred grand on syphon
niles is struck dumb
hes never seen that much money before
playing the flustered clerk hold on ill have to get the manager
niles goes and returns with gondorff
whats the problem
pointing to the brief case he wants to put a half million on syphon
gondorff looks at the money a second and then looks up at lonnegan like hes gotta be crazy
uneasily i cant lay that off in time
we lose a bet that big it could break us
challenging if ya win it could make ya too
to niles what are the odds on syphon
eight to one
gondorff looks at lonnegan long and hard
a half mill on an eight to one shot
youre dumber than i thought lonnegan
youre more gutless than i thought
the words last flash are heard on the speaker
gondorff looks at lonnegan with utter contempt
he turns to niles
chopped take it
niles hurriedly writes out a slip for dollars
lonnegan allowing himself a sly smile picks it up and retires to a nearby table
he flashes a little okay sign to hooker who acknowledges it with a nod
ladies and gentlemen this is arnold rowe your caller for the san antonio handicap at pimlico in baltimore a mile and for three year olds
and theyre off
lonnegan takes a deep breath and leans forward in his chair the larceny boiling in his veins
hooker looks to gondorff
gondorff gives him the office
hooker has to smile
and around the first turn its kings image by a neck syphon is second by one key to the vault third by one half followed by mr
moonlight red ridge moneyman and no charge
unexpectedly kid twist bursts in through the entrance
barely able to control his enthusiasm he hurries over to lonnegans table and sits down next to him
sorry but i just couldnt wait
did everything go all right
motioning for him to keep his voice down take it easy
everythings all right
i put it on syphon on the nose
in utter horror on the nose
i said place
place it on syphon
that horse is going to run second
lonnegan looks like hes just been stabbed
he vaults over the table to the tellers window and grabs niles
you give me my goddamn money back
you hear me
theres been a mistake
im sorry sir
the bettings closed
lonnegan begins to shake him violently
you give me my money back
theres been a mistake do you hear me
gondorff leaps to niles aid when suddenly there is a crash at the entrance door and polk snyder and eight federal agents burst into the room guns drawn
the place falls silent except for the loudspeaker the members of the boost afraid to move
gondorff and niles look at each other wondering how this could have possibly happened
motioning to hooker all right hooker you can go
hookers eyes go to gondorff who looks back at him in utter disbelief the betrayal raging in his features
hooker unable to meet his gaze lowers his head and starts to walk out
almost unnoticed theres a flash of movement at gondorffs belt
a small gun
hooker clutches his back and falls dead on the floor the blood spurting from his mouth
polk reacting instantly pours four shots into gondorff who goes down in a heap
pandemonium breaks loose
the members of the boost race for the door
lonnegan is totally stunned
first he lost his money and now hes involved in a murder
snyder rushes over to him
we gotta get you outa here
snyder drags him through the crowd and out onto the street where an f
car is waiting
his bodyguards have long since fled at the sight of the f
my moneys back there
well worry about that later
snyder gets in beside lonnegan and the car speeds away
the pandemonium has now ceased
those who could escape have the rest are lined up against the wall in frisking position
gondorff and hooker lie on the floor dead
the loudspeaker drones on
singleton is still calling the race from his booth apparently oblivious to whats happened
and the winner is kings image by four lengths syphon is second by two moneyman third by two and one half
time for and miles and seconds
polk walks slowly over to hookers body and bends down
hooker opens his eyes and slowly drags himself up off the floor spitting out a little rubber bladder filled with blood that hes had in his mouth
gondorff does likewise
niles twist singleton and the rest of the boost begin to laugh and shake hands as do the federal agents
to polk nice con hickey
i thought you were feds myself when you first came in
no problem henry
snyder went for it all the way
laughing you shoulda seen the rag he lit under lonnegan
gondorff turns to the others
okay lets take this place apart and get outa here
you can get your splits from eddie at boudreaus tonight
gondorff walks over to hooker whos wiping the blood off his face and hands
you beat him kid
softly you were right henry
its not enough
but its close
you wanta wait for your share
naw id just blow it
gondorff nods and walks slowly to behind the bar
he comes out with his suitcase in one hand and hookers paper bag in another
he throws the paper bag to hooker who stops by the door
eirie kid is standing there
hooker gives the office to eirie who beams and gives it back
then hooker and gondorff leave
we hold on them two ragtail grifters again as they walk off down the street and disappear around the corner
