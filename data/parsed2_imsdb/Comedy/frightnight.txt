written by marti noxon moving through a tract development
the houses are like mexican food the basic elements are all the same just mixed differently
a gloomy night no moon
and a slightly ominous pattern emerges
green thriving lawns and meticulously tended homes abut brown yards and porches littered with old newspapers and pizza joint flyers
each third or fourth house is for sale or worse seemingly abandoned
this area is in danger of becoming a ghost town
a deep commanding voice pierces the silence defy reason
defy everything you know
now we move in on one of the homes
not the nicest on the block but inhabited
lights on in the windows
inside the house
a middle class family lives here
the living room is empty but the tvs on
a commercial for peter vincent
a las vegas institution hes a magician whose show is all gothic horror movie imagery
peters wiry hot a rock and roll bad boy
hes cutting a girl up with a chain saw
and grinning like a mad man
peter vincents fright night
the family dog is up on the coffee table eating whats left of a fast food burger and fries still in the box
somethings moving in the dark
also on the table a role playing game in progress
magic the gathering
elves and wizards
only at the hard rock
nightly wednesday through sunday
now we hear what at first sounds like a muffled argument coming from another room
get off her
more voices yelling something being thrown
an ugly domestic scene
we creep down a dark hall toward a cracked door light seeps through the opening it slams open and adam crashes toward us
hes nice looking a little nerdy and hes in a blind terror
we get a glimpse of the horrible scene behind the door
a teen girls room the sound of flesh ripping
we see a pale arm on the ground shaking violently as if something is tearing and tugging at the body attached to it
we bolt away with adam who we now see is blood splattered as he races upstairs
a phone cradle is ripped out of the wall which adam nearly falls over
adam races into his parents room
another horrible glimpse his mothers body splayed across her frilly bed
blood on pale pink sheets
adam goes to his fathers side of the bed and now we see adams fathers body
his father was reaching for a gun hed hidden under the bed
adam gets down under the bed desperately reaches for the gun
its just beyond his grasp
come on come on come on
he gets it
but the gun has a gun lock
adam has to dig in his dead fathers pockets for his keys
adam starts to cry
come on come on
he finds them struggles to unlock the gun with shaking hands
the bed is turned over in one violent throw
adam is exposed
we see only a hint of the creature that looms over brutally strong veins dark and visible under the skin
human but not quite
adam reacts in horror
he knows hes dead
hes ripped out of frame as we hear were looking at a nice day here in clark county hitting a season low of only degrees
music starts under the disc jockey as we look down from high above at the same suburban neighborhood as before
in the daylight it seems nice
pocket parks decorate almost every corner and kids ride bikes in the street
mothers unload groceries
so get out there and enjoy this beautiful wednesday people
we swoop closer and find that radio comes from a passing minivan with those cutesy stick figure family decals on the rear window
the for sale signs and brown lawns dont seem nearly so foreboding now
we swoop up again and see beyond shadow hills past the wall that encompasses it and become aware for the first time that the community is surrounded by flat arid
in the distance we can just make out the glow of las vegas proper
it looks like a distant fantasy a land locked pleasure island
the wheels of a dirt bike as it zooms down the street
widen to see charlie brewster who is pushing the bike as fast as he can
it starts sputters then craps out
to the bike pissed you want me to take you apart huh
charlies and has the slightly awkward feel of someone who just recently came into his body and good looks
hes a wry thoughtful kid whos enjoying but not quite trusting a sudden surge in popularity
still talking to bike i will
ill sell you for parts
dont think i wont charlie stops embarrassed
doris a neighbor watches him talk to his bike
paused as she hauls her trash cans to the curb
shes super pretty in a wholesome way except for her ridiculous body
she nods to the bike amused
nothing doing huh
the things got no ambition
re trash cans can i uh give you a hand
i got it
she walks away her sweatpants have the word lucky across the butt
he watches her go appreciatively
doesnt notice his mom jane struggling to pull their own cans to the curb
dont leer at the neighbors kid
jane s attractive and frazzled wears a real estate brokers blazer
charlie wheels his bike back to the curb
he and his mom have had an affectionate teasing relationship which has only recently started to have more edge
shes the one who put a word on her butt
im just reading it
jane eyes a large dumpster full of concrete that sits in front of their next door neighbors yard
is he ever going to move that thing
you need to get over it mom
observes him then youve been tense or something
schools great actually
hasnt dumped me yet
he says this like hes surprised
thatll teach you to get so tall and handsome
getting what you want is stressful
especially when youre not used to it
more to lose
are you reading those books again
the power of whatever the hell
he glances at the dumpster
theyre not working
youre still flipping out about a big box
now jane moves to the open garage and starts loading open house signs into her trunk
charlie stands there
she shoots him a look then he helps her load
its an eyesore
im trying to convince people to move in not join the legions leaving town if you say mortgage crisis again im getting a new mom
the guy moves in and puts a giant trash can in his yard
when the perrys lived there charlie has heard this before
its a common refrain
the perrys were the greatest neighbors ever
but they moved
i thought you were happy their place finally sold
back on the neighbor hes not digging a pool
where do you think all that concretes coming from
youre spying on the guy now
hes thirteen feet from our house
thats not spying thats observing
a beetle convertible pulls up
amy drives and her two hot friends cara and bee sit in the back
any is a stunner
and shes as cool as she is beautiful the girl every other guy in school would die to be with
but charlie is
and he cant believe his luck
which puts him off his game
she makes him feel like hes always playing catch up
charlie moves toward the vw
jane calls after him
oh hey ed called
im tired of making excuses charlie
if you dont want to talk to him would you please tell him
kinda defeats the purpose
he gets to amy and the girls
amy glances at the dirt bike
still cant get the bike started huh
so you dont need a ride
amy calls his bluff and starts to drive off
charlie grabs his backpack and races after her
no hey stop she laughs stops the car
charlie tries to jump in and she drives again
charlie runs and finally dives into the back headfirst
the girls are laughing
watching them drive off gone in a cloud of teen spirit
the beetle zips through a commercial strip
more suburban paradise
charlies in the front seat now
amy drives one hand on the wheel
casually drops one on charlies leg
charlie tries to act casual but hes stoked and
cara half sleeps in the back while bee leans forward flirty and eyes charlies colorful puma sneakers
charlies a sneakerhead a serious collector
takes a man to wear purple chuck
chuck likes it when i call him chuck right chuck
intimidated by these girls he tries to form a witty retort
its theyre not thats like puce
thats a macho puce
can you stop someplace
im severely under caffeinated
ignores her to bee did you see the poster for the formal
the theme is hope
they asked me to be on the committee again but i was like hope is completely
did you suggest despair
nobody would see that coming
or global warming
everybody has to wear tin foil
laughs to charlie did you go last year
we basically did the whole thing bee and me
i ah was in training that week
this big triatha cutting him off chuck was still under his rock
were so glad you crawled out
i have econ first period
amy takes her hand off his leg
its no big deal
amy pulls into a coffee place
the girls climb out
thank you jesus
amy catches charlie looking at his watch fidgeting
youre not going to flunk for missing econ brain
no im but shes already walking away
he watches her move off anxious and smitten
charlie arrives with amy cara and bee all the girls now sport coffee drinks
charlie has one too with whipped cream and the works
kids stream into a nice modern looking high school
amy takes charlies arm
you stress too much
i wasnt worried
you were doing your worried thing
i have a whats my ladies
a couple of handsome jock type guys mark and ben roll up along side charlie and the girls
they draw looks from other students as they move through the courtyard
the cool kids
to charlie re drink seriously
you cant ride with the girls anymore
you let them brush your hair my pretty pony
mark grabs the cup away from him
starts drinking it
takes his arm chucks secure arent you
we see that ben is also wearing pumas
its a thing
charlie shows his off hes secure
i have track after school maybe we can hook up later
pulls her aside awkward you know the formal
dont think i wasnt going to ask you because i thought it was an obvious go
hope puppies kittens the whole deal
you and me
nobody goes to the dance senior year
she smiles moves off
he watches her lets out a breath
i knew that
mark and ben enjoy the view as the girls move off
mark incredulous says to charlie did you find a frickin genie lamp man
make a sacrifice to the hot ass gods
how do you get that
game my friend
charlie moves off
and even though hes playing it off we see that marks hit a nerve
this hot girlfriend thing is a bitch
mark calls after him you dont even have a car
charlies in econ class
seated in a back row near mark and ben
a number of seats in class are empty
teacher looks around
marks chart then courtney heuer
a girl raises her hand
charlie bored idly checks out the class
stops when he sees a tweaked looking kid ed staring at him
evil ed is a slight faintly punk looking kid whos been picked on by bullies his whole life
hes hyper intelligent hyper critical and
and his binder is covered with comic book stickers
ed sees that hes caught charlies eye
nods significantly at him
like you know and i know
charlie looks away
as if he didnt see him
charlie mark and ben move down the hall
mark shows charlie a picture on his phone
a woman posing seductively
where did you get that
shes hard up man
equations dont keep you warm at night
they stop see evil ed approaching
this amuses mark and ben
but charlies uncomfortable wants to bolt
i think its going to talk to us
i need a minute
its going to talk to brewster
when are you going to get the message
we dont know you he does
before the summer and his jock lobotomy
to ed uncomfortable whats the deal man
ed stares charlie down
ben and mark bust out laughing
mark looks at charlie
just the two of you
he can school you in the ways of geek douchery
the way ed says his name is enough to propel charlie into action
he grabs ed and pulls him aside
mark and ben watch with interest out of earshot
eds tone is dire serious as a heart attack
charlies looking around self conscious
what do you mean hes missing
i keep trying him nothing
no texts no phone
and hes not the only one whos gone
you heard roll call
so kids arent coming to school
what do you want me to do about it
meet me at his house after school
well check around
see whats up if hes okay
i cant after school
i dont think you get what im look do we have to do this here
ed cant believe it
charlies totally blowing him off
he starts to lose it raises his voice what am i not even suppose to speak to you now
keep it down
dont spaz its so horrible
crossing the streams
will high school as we know it cease to exist
ed glances at mark and ben who still watch from a distance
you want me to tell your pals how well we know each other
the lego contests the farscape conventions or how your first sexual experience was with an electra figurine no
then be my backup
adams after school
dont be late
charlie sees the guys watching him
he shrugs like i have no idea what that was about
the sun has set behind the mountains
its gloomy gray out right before dark
charlie and amy park climb out of her car with drinks from planet smoothie in hand
shes still in her track and field clothes
you know what i want
youre eating right now you know
as you speak
you literally just forced me to get you a smoothie so large they named a planet after it i ran six miles
what did you do
i watched you
but not in a creepy way
charlie winces a little
it sounds creepy
so dont judge
you dont want me to burn my big ole booty off do you
charlie on impulse stops her kisses her
what was that for
i dont know youre just
a sweet moment
these two have a definite thing
theyre about to kiss again when janes girlish laugh stops them
they both turn and react as they see
a muscled male squatting and hunched over clad only in a white wife beater and jeans
we cant make out his face
jane stands over him laughing at something hes said as he fixes their sprinkler
push in as the guy looks up
this is jerry
handsome to the point of devastating
an all american adonis
look at mom
shesa damn right
if he followed her home you have to let her keep him
amy laughs almost skips toward them milking the moment
ed paces anxiously in front of adams house
he has a duffle bag over his shoulder
keeps checking his phone
he finally dials in a number
im in front of adams
remember the videos we all made back when
you and me and adam bro
want your pals to get a load of that
amy and charlie approach jane and jerry
they overhear so not a pool whats the work youre doing
jerry has an easy going way about him
an inviting charm
i had to rip up half the basement
these houses were built practically overnight
im never surprised when they come apart
just needed a new stem
jane sees charlie and amy approaching
jerry this is my son charlie
and his do we say girlfriend now
i mean only if shes amys amused at charlies squirming finally saves him
shakes jerrys hand hi
he cant help but give amy an appreciative once over
she enjoys it but pulls away and moves closer to charlie
charlie notices the exchange the way this dude oozes manliness
doesnt like it one bit
he shakes jerrys hand a little too firmly
lowers his voice a bit
jerrys our new neighbor
the perry place
looks to charlie smiles no kidding
sorry about the mess man
i was just telling your mom ill have the dumpster gone next week
doesnt bother me
jerry does night construction on the strip
noticing charlies shoes you play ball
im always looking for a pick up game
now and then you know
its more of a collector thing
to jerry those teens they sleep on sidewalks to get them
charlie looks at jane thanks for embarrassing me
well theyre bold
i like them
jerry looks back at jane
a little flirtatious
id ask you guys inside but its a mess
ive been meaning to
a drink something
it hangs there waiting for an invitation
jane just smiles
and thank you so much
for the help
least i could do
jane amy and charlie walk toward the house
jerry moves off
amy looks at jane amazed
why did you blow him off
oh my god
a guy that good looking still single
hes a player
breaking it down
ive had enough man trouble
im not getting suckered again
amy and charlie meet eyes
that was loaded
dont listen to me
jaded old charlies phone buzzes
he checks it
a video clip from ed
titled kid comeback and super squid
it shows charlie ed and adam when they were younger prancing around in homemade costumes and indeed tights
the text message says minutes or this is going wide
alarmed to amy wow
i gotta go
call you later
i have dinner on i gotta go
ill eat later
but charlies already off and running
charlie approaches sees ed pacing in front of the house
hes flipping out
where the hell have you been
you said after school chill out
ed is already lugging his big duffle to adams front door
its dusk dude you know what that means
that the suns gone down
whats over him ed knocks loudly
rings the bell
a long pause
lets go but eds already heading around the house with the duffle
ed wriggles in through the dog door
he turns lets charlie in
charlie looks around
this is nuts
its the same house we saw in the opening but completely righted
tv is off the walls are clean
furniture in its proper place
they move into the house
ed is wired scared
ed and charlie here
charlie follows him in
resigned and placating
ed opens his duffle bag
inside are crosses stakes holy water even a small ax
ed hands charlie a stake
charlie eyes it incredulous
youve got to be kidding me
this is it
i hate to tell you this but that guy your neighbor
hes a vampire
one of the undead
i just met him
thats a terrible vampire name
seriously i didnt name him man im just reporting the facts
ed moves up the stairs
charlie reluctantly follows
its darker up here
come on this is a gag right
eds barely listening cautious
every shadow is potential death
total shmuck bait
they pass the empty master bedroom where we saw adams parents slaughtered
now its clean and empty
then ed turns into adams room
its full of geekery
action figures the like
charlie sticks behind him
the guys dont register the mostly obscured form of somebody hiding behind the door
a large male figure
ed catches sight of the guy and spins toward it freaked
charlie also reacts scared
get back demon
ed thrusts his cross forward which knocks the door open toppling a movie character standee
then ed lets out a slightly manic laugh
i killed that sucker dead
theyre not here okay
they left town
his dad was a deadbeat ed pulls a map out of his pocket
it has lots of red and black dots marked on it
he thrusts it at charlie
no see its not just them
it started there was this thing on channel a lady escaped an attacker who tried to bite her
ed points to the red dots on his chart
they form a loose circle around charlies house
adam and me we graphed the attack the disappearances
whole families gone
and thats you guys at the center see
his windows are totally theres a ton of houses like that
people work nights on the strip but every window
ive been watching him
it all fits that jerrys a dracula
dracula is a specific vampire
i know what youre saying
im mocking you
youve been reading too much twilight fiction okay
this is real
a real monster
and hes not brooding
hes the fucking shark from jaws
he feeds he kills and he doesnt move on until everyone around him is dead
and that book sucks
charlie cant help but pause
eds conviction is so real
but he shakes it off
what about your neighbors the perrys
he moved into their house
havent seen them around have you
yeah in san diego like a month ago
exception proves the rule
you havent asked him in have you
he cant get in without an invitation
no but your mom
youre on drugs
i thought youd take my word but i have evidence at home
charlie stops fighting it and humors him
eds lost it
we have to stake him in his nest
you and me
not now its dark
cause hes nocturnal
just for okay for a minute pretend youre not a douche now look ed this stuff it was fun when we were eight whatever
i grew up okay
you dont want to fine
but dont get an attitude because id rather have a life than make shit up
youre soooo cool brewster
go ahead join the clark high early peakers
this is the pinnacle for them
and that includes your girl
undeniably doable but we used to make fun of her and her pals remember
theyre bimbos shut up
charlie barely refrains from hitting ed
instead he shoves him away
he looks up at charlie genuinely hurt and desperate
adams gone you act like it has nothing to do with you
we were inseparable man
and you know when i got popular
the minute i stopped hanging out with you
charlie takes off
ed watches him go
a while later
its really dark now
ed gripping his duffle bag nervously skates down a residential street
houses here are spaced far apart and the lights in many of them are off
ed is anxious watchful
he knows its not safe
every dark corner is potentially the end of him
a few cars pass
something moves behind him
ed abandons his skateboard and bolts
a hand slams on his shoulder spins him around
its mark charlies pal from school
you crossed my yard
tracked your nerdjuice all over it
sorry my mom works hard on that shit ed glances around nervously its dark and anything
else could be out there
can you just hit me
i dont have time for the build up
he steels himself go
just do it
mark winds up and swings a brutal blow
ed ducks and runs
marks immediately on his heels
the guys dodge and dart through the neighborhood
but ed has experience in the art of losing bullies and he manages to shake mark for a moment
ed scrambles over a wooden fence but his duffle bag gets caught on top
most of his vamp hunting stuff spills over on the other side of the fence
theres not time to get the stuff
he can hear mark approaching in the dark
he drops into a neighbors backyard
ed spins and slams right into mark no its jerry
ed falls back and scrambles away terrified
im armed mother fucker
jerry moves after ed angry but controlled
more like a man than a monster
mark pulls up on the other side of the wood fence
sees eds vamp hunting stuff on the ground laughs
a beat mark glances at the high fence
decides hes done
he kicks some of eds stuff as he moves off
ed trips over kids toys and bikes as he runs to the house
theres a porch light on over the back door
pounding on door hey
let me in
but theres no answer
ed is desperate sees jerry closing in walking across the backyard
ed takes a rock and smashes the window over the kitchen sink
ed falls through the window into the kitchen
jerry stalks toward him
all hulking menace
but eds safe now
calls out forget it sucker
jerry kicks in the kitchen door
ed terrified falls back
i thought you did your homework
youve been watching me
ive been watching you
ed bolts into the house
as he races through the empty rooms he pulls a stake from his pocket
we see hes wearing a cross around his neck on a long chain
jerrys following but barely breaking a sweat
ed sees a sliding glass door to the back
he fumbles with the lock gets it open and runs into the backyard
ed races for the back gate jerry has him by the back of the cross hes wearing
eds lifted way off his feet by the chain until hes choking on it the cross directly under his neck
jerry looks away as he snaps the chain off ed and hurls the cross into the neighbors pool
ed falls to the ground watches the cross sink in despair
jerrys standing over him
smiles a little
we get just a flash he suddenly has more teeth sharper in rows
bit off more than you can chew
shaking terrified ed brandishes the stake
well see man
i know my shit
but jerry doesnt appear to be afraid
he looks at ed with actual sympathy
whos going to believe you
you see the truth but what good is it when youre alone
eds shaken but still grips the stake
dont play that stuff
that mind crap
come on try me
you say youre glad youre different
but how can you be in a place like this
even your best friend
youre nothing to him now
eds listening despite himself hurting now
jerry moves a step in
ed raises his stake again but with slightly less conviction
it can be over
i can make all that pain go away
eds fighting tears
life as he knows it is gone
you were born for this and you know it
your life what you had
thats the illusion
off eds silence i can take you somewhere great
somewhere youll belong
ed takes this in
his eyes clear a bit
its a gift
and jerry moves closer blocking our view
a new day
sunny and hot
a truck moves the dumpster from jerrys house
through the kitchen window jane watches the dumpster drive away
shes pleased a little surprised
says to herself
good on his word
a knock at the door
she lets herself in
my voice seems to be on some frequency he cant hear
amy looks at jane who shakes her head
amy moves to the island
grins a little
talk to hot neighbor again
you should facebook him
shakes her head temptress
charlie runs down
wet from the shower discombobulated
pecks amy grabs food off a plate
hes out of sorts
off her look weird dreams
charlie gives jane a quick peck and follows amy out
amy and charlie head to the car
charlie turns looks back at jerrys house
the blacked out windows
charlie snaps out of it
its crazy to even entertain eds theories
that guy was such a tool
she gets in the car
smiles a little
charlies in class
hes restless agitated
on his pad he absently draws vampire images blood
charlie looks up
charlie looks around
and just like he said quite a few other kids are missing
charlie takes this in looks around
seats all around him are empty
this time it makes an impact
charlie mark ben and the rest of the guys get ready for practice
marks in the middle of a story but charlie is distracted barely listening
shes wearing a jumpsuit dude
like one zip and pop
whats up with you
dreaming about your little boyfriend
charlie takes this in worried
you see him around today
i dont track its whereabouts
what did he want anyway
but charlies clearly distracted
look i have to go
ill bail with you
no im i dont feel so well
he takes off
ben and mark watch him perplexed
another suburban development
rows and rows of red tile roofs houses stacked right on top of one another
charlie rings the bell of a modest place
not as big as where charlie and jane live
but nice well tended for
eds mom victoria answers
shes surprised to see him
yeah hi mrs
victoria breaks into a wide smile
god youre a sight for sore eyes
victoria pulls charlie in and hugs him happy
calls out rick
look at you
oh i you dont have to now rick eds dad comes into the room
shakes his hand
ed said youd sprouted
and youre the rick awkwardly gestures around his face
yes sir ed will be so sorry he missed you but you should both be in school now shouldnt you
hes not here
did you see him today
hes usually up and out early
were working on a class project
i guess we crossed paths
im so glad youre doing that
ed hed be mad that i said so but he talks about you all the time
this lands hard on charlie
how remiss hes been
would it be okay if i went upstairs
ed has a book we need
make yourself at home
charlie goes upstairs
victoria makes a face at rick thats good
theyre both pleased
eds room is a shrine to comic books horror and fantasy movies
theres an art table where ed has been working on some illustrations for a noir style graphic novel
charlie stops and looks at them
he looks at the photos on the wall including a few pictures of ed charlie and adam when they were friends
charlie and ed arms around each other
charlie is shorter and thinner with really bad acne
best not to dwell
he turns and sees peter vincents fright night poster on a wall
charlie takes it in laughs a little
then charlie examines a whole wall devoted to eds investigation of jerry
maps news reports vampire lore printed off the internet books etc
if you didnt know the difference youd say its just more of eds fictional world
charlie stares at it all for a beat
then shakes his head
its all a fantasy nothing more
this is crazy
he starts to take off
but sees that eds computer is on and one file stands out
the jerry diaries
charlie gives in to his curiosity clicks it open finds a bunch of quicktime files
he opens one
as blurry short clips play jerrys truck in motion but it looks like nobodys driving doris the neighbor chatting on jerrys lawn with nobody
over and over its appears that jerry doesnt show up on video
taking this in
its dark as charlie comes home
he looks warily at jerrys house as he searches for his keys
bam he walks right into jerry
charlie tries to maintain his cool
what if jerry is what ed thought
you could really do me a solid
i have a girl on her way over for a beer and im totally out of beer
theyre at charlies back door the one that leads to the kitchen
set me up ill pay you back two times
a sixer for your mom and one for you
uh yeah sure
jerry watches charlie as he unlocks the door
this is when charlie should invite him in
let me see what moms got
shes kind of a light domestic
charlie steps inside
pointedly doesnt ask jerry to enter
charlie intentionally leaves the door open moves to the refrigerator
but keeps his eyes on jerry
if he steps in uninvited eds theory is blown
same floor plan as my place huh
jerry leans against the door jamb but does not cross the threshold
charlie observes this
charlie and jerry meet eyes
then a cold smile creeps over jerrys face
charlie fumbles lets one of the wet beers slide from his hand it hits the ground explodes
can i help you with that
ill get it
jerry takes in charlies frantic refusal
now hes darkly certain
hes been made
charlie tosses the broken bottle into the sink
moves to the doorway with the remaining beers
charlie hands them over the threshold
but doesnt cross
there you go
jerry watches him intense
his tone shifts cocky and intimidating
a threat disguised as guy talk
this girl tonight shes a handful
women who look a certain way they need to be managed
you dont mind my saying you got a lot on your shoulders for a kid
your pal amy
must be a line of guys dying to pluck that
your mom too you dont see it maybe you do shes giving it off
its on you to watch out for them
you up for that
but holds himself in check
i think i can manage
cause there are bad people out there man
better keep an eye on your women
jerry backs away intimidating even as he retreats
thanks for the beers
charlie watches him move into the dark
charlie bursts into his room freaked out races to the window
his room is free of all geekery
now its all sports and sneakerhead stuff
amys there on his bed and surrounded by school books
shes reading wuthering heights
whereve you been
you told me to meet you here an hour ago
jerrys nowhere to be seen and his house is quiet
lights on behind blacked out windows
charlie breaks away from the window
its an effort
his focus is still half there even as he tries to talk to amy
he checks his phone
checks for anything from ed
why shouldnt it be
no it should
re her book you ever read this
amy moves to charlie
puts her arms around him
in a frustrated unconsummated sort of way
like us you mean
amy laughs pulls him onto the bed
shes feeling frisky
kinda makes it hotter
yeah so you keep saying
he smiles a little
she kisses him
but feels his distance
am i boring you
im kind of wiped out thats all
i can fix that
she kisses him again
despite himself charlie gets drawn in and turned on
she pulls back serious
want to get under the covers
see how it goes
charlies dying inside
could not be a worse time
believeme when i say thereis nothing in the worldidratherdo charlie
dont be nervous
she kisses him again
its intense passionate
charlie weakens a little
maybe death and mayhem can wait
amy moves to take off her top
god ding dong
somebody is ringing the bell at jerrys
practically tosses amy off him
you hear that
he rushes to the window
doris is at jerrys front door
holding a bottle of wine
jerry comes to the door
he and doris start chatting
shes flirting up a storm
shit shit shit amy sees what charlie sees
shes a stripper
they were bound to find each other
take away two tiny pieces of cloth stripper
no jerry is showing doris in when he stops and looks directly at charlie
charlie dives away from the window grabbing amy and pulling her down too
he looked right at us
not a big deal charlies freaked now
doris is in there
no it is a big
a very big
he saw us and he was pissed
amy moves away
looking at him skeptically
if youre not into this say so
dont do me any favors
i am i totally am
just i dont trust that guy
he glances out the window again
amys irritated not used to having her passes rejected
she gathers her stuff
youve got your neighborhood watch thing
come on dont be that way but shes gone
charlies torn he should go after her
but doriss muted laugh from the other house draws his attention
he looks again at jerrys house
he can see faint shadows moving behind the windows in the house like ghosts
charlies conflicted freaked what can he do
he picks up the phone
then thinks better of it
finally he stops at the window eyes on jerrys place
listening and watching intently
charlies fallen asleep in a chair by the window
hes startled awake by a womans screams
they sound like they are coming from jerrys
but are they screams of pleasure or pain
charlie looks out the window
jerrys house is dark
its all quiet
charlie looks at the clock
charlie sits back on his bed
was it a dream
then charlie hears a motor start
charlie goes back to the window
jerrys truck starts and jerry drives off
off charlie unsettled
a short while later
charlie moves cautiously into jerrys backyard
hes wearing all black and his dads old winter gloves
he looks at his iphone
on the phone a diagram
how to pick a lock
charlie steels his nerves
at jerrys back door he clumsily tries to pick the lock
after a moment or two he realizes he has no idea what hes doing
he walks away from the door frustrated
then turns and impulsively tries to kick in the door with his foot
then something occurs to charlie
he goes into the garden
charlie finds a fake rock
turns it over
it has a key in it
charlies like duh
he puts the key in the back door lock
charlie moves through the first story of the house
hes cautious on edge
at first the place seems totally unremarkable
a typical guy pad
lots of inexpensive furniture bad art a salt water fish tank
at every turn charlie expects something or someone to jump out at him
its unbearably tense
charlie looks upstairs
moves through a plain white hallway finds an open door that leads to jerrys office where he keeps an extensive library
on one wall hangs a tapestry that looks very old decorated with a strange insignia
charlie takes a picture of it with his phone
charlie goes into jerrys bedroom opens his closet
sees a variety of uniforms
cop gas man ups etc
charlie reacts chilled
jerrys truck is pulling into the driveway
charlies in a panic
jerry will be inside any moment
theres no time to get out so charlie ducks into the closet
charlie pushes as far back into the closet as he can go
leans against the back wall
the back of the closet swings open and charlie falls back into a hidden hallway
charlie stands stunned see that the hallway is lined by small rooms on either side
its clear that these are additions jerrys added
each room has a small rectangular window so you can see in
charlie reacts sick
it looks like a prison
despite the danger he creeps over and looks in one of the rooms a pale hand slaps against the window
doris is in the window now
bruised and so pale she looks almost blue
oh my god
oh shit charlie tugs on the door
he stands back what to do
charlie hears a noise
the front door
and then jerrys footsteps approaching
get me out of here
doris pounds on the door
in a cold panic
im i wont leave you but charlie has no choice
the footsteps are getting closer
charlie ducks inside one of the cells across from doris moves behind the door
jerry steps into the hallway walks right by charlies hiding place
pauses near him
the door is ajar
was it that way before
charlie holds his breath
jerry moves to the cell and retrieves doriss half alive body from it
charlie cautiously looks through the crack in the door
the door to doriss cell open
charlie can see part of doriss body and face
jerry is mostly obscured bent over doris holding her
charlie watches helplessly horrified
dont kill me
doriss body tenses and starts to jerk as jerry tugs and rips at it savagely
its clear hes feeding on her although we cant see his face
doris screams then starts to cry
its stark and real and terrifying
it seems to go on and on
doris weakens her head lolling to one side her light fading
a small stream of blood spreads across the white pavement
in the position shes in she is eye to eye with charlie
she sees him smiles weakly
then mouths something too weak to make much sound
charlie is petrified
doris gets it smiles a little grimly puts a finger to her lips
after what seems like an eternity jerry is satisfied
he tosses doris aside and stands away from her
charlie ducks behind the door as jerry emerges and casually wipes a spot of blood from his mouth
then jerry locks doris back into her cell
pockets the key and moves off toward the stairs
after a moment hes gone
the sound of a tv starts in jerrys living room
something banal like the real housewives of orange county
charlie knows this is his moment
with shaking hands he retrieves his iphone and pulls up the how to pick a lock screen
charlie looks through the window in doriss cell
shes breathing alive
charlie whispers to himself as he uses a bobby pin and a tiny screwdriver on the lock
the bobby pin slips
charlies losing it
the tension is unbearable
charlie can hear jerry moving downstairs
the lock slides open
charlie breathes with relief
then he grabs doris and bolts
charlie slips in a pool of blood left behind from jerrys feeding but he manages to stay on his feet
he pushes doris ahead of him to a back staircase
his phone drops out of his pocket he has to double back every moment counts
doriss barely aware of whats happening let alone where she is
a moment later
charlie and doris emerge downstairs near the entry hall
they can see the front door and hear jerry moving in another room
charlie looks around trying to get oriented
jerry emerges almost sees them
charlie ducks into a hiding spot and grabs doris covering her mouth
a long beat as jerry returns to the living room with a beer
settles in a chair facing away from the door
charlie considers his options
says almost silently same floor plan
he grabs doris and bolts for the kitchen
a back door
charlie and doris race for it doris stumbles and bumps into a chair
stifles a cry
jerry turns at the noise
charlie throws the back door open he and doris escape
the sun is just starting to rise
charlie races for his house with doris holding on to him tight
shes crying with gratitude and relief manages thank you thank you
doris looks up at him her eyes turning black her veins going gray
a first ray of pure sunlight hits them
in a flash doris starts to burn
charlie is helpless to stop it as she goes up in flames and explodes
jerry moves into the kitchen
the back door is closed now but the blinds sway slightly
and there are bloody prints on the floor from charlies sneakers
jerry takes this in coldly furious
charlie sits on his bed still in a state of shock
this shit is for real
jane comes to the door her knock cursory
youre going to be late
jane moves to the windows throws the curtains open
charlie winces at the sun
he got no sleep looks like hell
the hours you keep
its like living with a vampire
looks at her
she has no idea
listen promise me that guy next door jerry
under no circumstances do you invite him into our house
i think i can handle myself
no no you cant charlie dont even look in his direction understand
and at night you stay inside
because hes dangerous
what kind of dangerous
charlie starts gathering his things
getting ready to bolt
can you trust me
for once dont ask a million questions charlie
im your mom not some ridiculous woman im sorry
we just dont have time for a big thing
im telling you thats enough
im done with this conversation
she moves away
mom but shes gone
charlie looks after her worried
charlie approaches the school
kids swarm around him happy and care free
charlies in another world
as various pages pop up true vampire tales
vampire chat city how to kill a vampire as he scrolls and frantically scribbles notes
as charlie notes tons of contradictory facts
vamps must avoid all daylight
vamps can walk in fog or twilight
vamps always sleep in the dirt
vamps never sleep
vamps can only die from stake through the heart
vamps only die from fire
three bites to turn a victim into a vamp
one bite and the victim has to feed from the vamp
vamps change form bats animals etc
vamps absolutely can not shape shift
we see now that hes on a computer in the school library isolated behind some stacks
he clicks a link on one of the sites which leads him to peter vincents website
its an elaborate interactive site
it says that vincent is a serious student of all things occult especially vampires and has amassed a vast collection of books and artifacts
it also claims that there are different tribes of vampires
he writes in big letters hey
charlie looks up
amy stands over him a little wary
charlie covers his writing and closes his computer screen
he looks like hell
disheveled sleep deprived tense
you werent in class
what are you working on
i thought it was something creepy
then look id better

she looks away losing patience
im just i could use some coffee
she looks back
charlie and amy sit in the busy quad
we cant hang out at my house any more
my moms flipping out about some stuff
i can see you at school but for a while why

he has to protect her but how
ben and mark join them
notice how tweaked charlie looks
you look like dog shit
your pal the spaz his folks were here earlier
its a big thing

charlie stands upset
charlie chill out you dont know what youre talking about
he could be dead for all you know
mark steps in
youre worried and its totally understandable
but hes better off man
hell be happier with the other trolls on the shire
charlie decks mark
they go to the ground and charlie lets loose on him
a bunch of other guys pull them apart amid shouts etc
mark is bloodied and freaked
what the fuck man
amy stands back appalled
what the hell is wrong with you
youre an idiot you know that
and its hobbits on the shire
charlie turns to amy come on
but she shakes her head and moves to mark and ben
just get out of here charlie
he knows its over
heartbroken he takes off
charlie gets off the bus and walks toward one of the nicer hotels
hes looking at another how to on his phone
how to meet a celebrity
as charlie grabs a las vegas sun from a rack
charlie watches a bunch of conventioneers with badges in the a guy about charlies size leaves his coat and badge on his chair goes to get his food
charlie sweeps in and quietly takes it
s but all wiry rock n roll attitude
leather pants and tattoos long black hair wrapped in a bandana
dark painted nails and heavy eye make up
heavy metal music blares
the whole scene is over the top goth cheesiness
lots of stage effects and fire
pamela anderson look alikes in skimpy outfits prance on stage as another sexy girl is handcuffed s m style to a circular we see that this is a run through
tech guys work light boards etc
a director and scattered others sit in the seats
sneaks in one of the back doors
silently moves close to the stage
hes wearing the stolen coat
the badge holder now has the sun masthead logo inside
it looks at first glance like a legit credential
peter reveals a tray full of sharp daggers
he raises them to the audience
the knives are real
he cuts his own palm with one bleeds
doesnt even wince
the girl is real
he grabs her feels her up
peter yanks down on the circular board the assistants tied to sending her spinning
and if i miss shell really be dead
the music switches
its all tension
peter flings a dagger
the assistant ducks as the knife embeds in the board behind her this close where her head was
also out of character peter speaks in a thick queens you cant say that
moves to her stop the stop
the music stops
the spinning board stops
you almost tore my extensions out
why do you have to throw a real knife
it barely cuts
that board is like butter
he tears the makeup appliance off his hand that made it look like he cut himself
the assistant pulls out of her velcro straps
everybody else fakes it
but this looks authentic then learn how to throw
she stomps off the stage
peter cant believe it
he starts to stalk off stage
charlie rushes toward him
vincent a tech guy moves in on charlie
from the sun
we had an appointment
i dont think so
talk to my guy
were doing a piece vampires
separating myth from fact
you want a comment
thats a shit idea for an article
peter starts to move off
charlie anxious follows
i really i need your expertise
youre the man on this stuff right
peter sees how desperate charlie is
what is this like your first assignment
takes this in then ten minutes
peter lives in a two story penthouse at the top of one of the casino hotels that he works in
its lavish floor to ceiling windows etc
still goth influence reigns
the decor is tacky haunted mansion all the way
charlie is shown into the museum by peters assistant arthur who looks and sounds a lot like peter
dont touch anything dude
charlie enters comes face to face with a snarling werewolf
then realizes its a life size model
charlie stands back takes in the place
its an amazing combination of fantasy memorabilia and actual occult weapons and objects
it seems to go on and on
got rooms of this crap
charlie examines a case that holds all kinds of torture devices and battle axes as well as spiked ball maces etc
cases hold ancient texts and scrolls haunted objects etc
charlie is genuinely impressed
the geek in him cant help it
peter enters talks to arthur midori me
arthur pours peter a green drink as peter pulls off his black wig bandana attached and peels off a nude body shirt that has a bunch of tattoos printed on
he steps out of his boots with three inch lifts
collapses into an arm chair
hes just another balding middle aged guy with bad eyes
peter downs his drink
arthur hands him the bottle
peter looks at charlie
in truth peters isolated himself to the point that he actually welcomes a visitor though hed never admit it
looks like pee but im hooked
on the job
peter scratches avidly at his crotch
leather it doesnt breath
fucking rashes are killing me
so im your expert huh
for your vampire thing
theyre all the rage huh
so say i want to kill one
how how would you do it
you got fire beheading
or go classic stake through the heart
so all that actually works
how the fuck do i know
i thought youre i read books man
you think im hanging out with dracula and the easter bunny
charlie realizes he has no choice
he has to reveal more
i i have a personal interest in this story
off peters look a friends missing actually
i think one of them got him
them meaning a vampire
he lives next door to me
but its no joke
if you look at these clips youll see
they take some time to load but
charlie moves to peter shows him his phone
digs into his pocket
and i printed up some photos i took
in his place
charlie put the photos in front of peter on the table
peters expression closes
he stands pissed
no come on im youre a nutjob
charlie deflates his desperation showing again
listen to me
i saw it
i saw him kill a girl
she burned up in my hands
you have to tell me how to stop him
get this loser out of my sight

he gestures to arthur
my cousin art
hes me on stage
thats how i teleport
people see what they want to see
this is what youve been looking for i promise
i can take you to him to his place
in clark county nevada
a hot bed of supernatural activity
a transient population
a town where people work all night sleep all day
a town full of con artists
not buying it no
youre working me or somebodys working you
charlies getting angry now
he already got my friend
i know how i sound
but im not crazy
i didnt want this
i dont want to know this
just tell me what to do
peter feels charlies sincerity
for a moment he looks genuinely conflicted
but his expression hardens
you heard me
he moves away
but charlie is on his heels
peter looks to arthur nods
so i save my own skin so he can keep killing
we have to kill him
arthur throws charlie out the door closed firmly behind him
charlie stands shut out
what the hell is he going to do now
moving in on the brewster home an odd sight is revealed
every window is draped with strings of garlic
charlies revealed in his window hammering up another long rope of the stuff
his gaze falls on jerrys house and we follow it
now we find that charlies entire room is decked out in anti vamp decor
not just the garlic but crosses and other religious pictures etc
charlie looks at the clock night coming too quickly
hes grimly focused as he starts sharpening a stake
jane doesnt enter this time
jane walks in
takes in the decor
the whole house looks like that show dark shadows
its a gag
takes this in then you like her a lot dont you
a moment when they could connect
but charlie just nods
then dont use tape on the walls
eds parents left a few messages looking for him
charlie looks up at this
he goes back to his work
jane looks at him for a beat then she starts to go
the doorbell rings
before jane can really react charlie pushes past her
dont open it
charlie races downstairs
amy is standing in the living room
howd you get in
it was unlocked
you have to lock the door
okay whatever listen
youre flipping out
punching out your friends and blowing everything off and is that a stake
he forgot he was holding it
he hides it behind his back
amy sits upset
looks around and sees that the living room is decked in more anti vamp decor
even if youre losing it you dont get to blow me off
you dont go from something to nothing overnight
youre not nothing to me charlie
whatevers happening just talk to me
charlie takes this in emotional
but i cant let you get hurt
you need to forget about me for a while
how am i going to get hurt
charlie now theres another knock at the door
jane comes downstairs i got it no
dont answer it
a tense moment
jerry stands at the door
this is ridiculous jane
its jerry from next door im telling you dont answer it
this is my house
ill answer the door if i want to
she starts to move to the door again
charlie blocks her way desperate
he murdered ed and adam
and i have proof
jane is stunned at a loss
from the other side of the door jane
i need to talk to you
just hold on
your son is harassing me
he pounds on the door
jane examines charlie closely
whatever he says dont he broke into my house
id rather not take this to the authorities
but i will
hes sick deluded mom
a tense beat
finally get the authorities
my son is a good kid
charlie sags with relief
a brief look of appreciation passes between charlie and jane
as he backs away from the door
his expression goes cold
he disappears into the dark
charlie races to a window
sees jerry move out of sight
what is he doing
whatever it is its not good
jerry stands back intense
hes got to take care of this problem now
charlies running from window to window now trying to see whats going on
just if we stay in here he has to give up
he cant get in without an invitation
like a vampire
amy and jane are blown away
charlies going crazy
jerry carries a shovel and a small saw
he stalks into the brewsters backyard where hes hidden from the street
jane follows charlie worried
think about what youre saying i have
ive processed believe me
jane takes this in
this is the gag
i cant believe you got jerry to go along with it
as he starts to dig underground amazingly strong and swift
charlie hands amy and jane both crosses on chains
put them on
just do it
i dont think this is funny
but she puts it on
jerry pulls up the natural gas line that leads to the brewsters house
he saws it open and lights the end on hisssssssssss
a strange sounds coming from under the floor
the gas fireplace explodes the stove explodes the water heater all explode at once
windows blow out as charlie jumps on jane and amy dragging them to the ground
the room starts to burn
charlie amy and jane are in a panic
they try to put the fire out but its no use
a chilling sight jerry stands on the other side of the blown out windows
his expression dark
through the flames he says dont need an invitation if theres no house
charlie grabs amy and jane and they run through the house
y charlie and jane race into the garage
i can drive i drive
they jump into janes car
hit the garage opener gun it mom
jane guns it through the opening garage door destroying it
she clips charlies dirt bike pushing it onto the sidewalk as she takes off
janes car swings wide into the street almost smashing into an arriving fire engine
charlie amy and jane scream
they narrowly avoid a head on collision with a fire truck
as he sees the dirt bike in the driveway
he jumps on
tries to start it
what did we do
what does he want
they are racing away when the dirt bike comes crashing through the back window of the car nearly taking amys head off
then the bike starts the wheels spinning wildly in the back seat
amys hair gets caught in the spokes its horrible as it yanks part of her hair out
charlie grabs her away from the bike she falls into his arms crying as jerrys big pickup appears in the rear windshield
jane speeds down the street which is wide and not heavily trafficked here
unlike the planned community of shadow hills now we can see were surrounded by great expanses of empty desert
jerrys truck smashes repeatedly into janes
my brother has a gun
good to know
is he here
call the police
anybody jane manages to evade jerry until the truck skids in a long arc in front of them and blocks them
jane screeches to a halt
in a flash jerry is out of the truck and coming for them
go charlie steps on the accelerator grabs the wheel and aims charlie
they run jerry over with a terrible thudddd
amy and jane scream
jane is aghast stops the car
oh my god
charlie steps on her accelerator foot the car zooms forward
are you nuts
you cant kill that guy
you have no idea
its him or us
jane looks at him can feel that hes telling the truth
charlies looking around as they speed down the highway in the rearview
no jerry anywhere
where is he
whered he go
everybody looks up
the roof of the car
jerrys hand shoots up through the floorboard under janes feet
jane and amy scream
jerrys eye glares through the small hole
its all black
hes tearing through metal from the undercarriage of the car where hes clinging face up
the more he rips away the more he reveals his face
his veins and eyes are black
his nose snout like
and his fangs emerge from lethal rows of jagged teeth like a shark
its shocking horrible
as jerry drags over the highway the pavement grinding away at his clothes and flesh
he reaches through the hole hes made and slams his fist down on the floor break
the car screeches to a sudden halt
on charlie amy and jane screaming even after the car has stopped
the car is rear ended by another vehicle
its a minivan
janes car is slammed the back is a crush of glass and metal
a grim moment only the sound of hissing air and groaning steel as everyone assesses the damage
are you jane
jane is woozy
charlie sees that the other car is drivable
the guy inside a family man is stunned and pissed
gets out of his car what the hell do you think youre doing
charlie gets out of the car too
yells urgent no
hey man stay in your but its too late
the guy is met by a horrific jerry hideously torn and bleeding who appears from under janes in a flash jerry grabs the guy and vamps ripping the family mans
as those cute stick figure family decals are splattered with blood
now out of the car react
jerry is a fucking vampire
jerry drops the business man whos dead as he hits the ground
he moves toward them
charlie looks at amy and jane
i told you so
charlie urgently grabs them
shoves them down the highway
get out of here
ill catch up
shes hurt get out of here
they back off
charlie pulls a large cross out of his coat and brandishes it as he walks toward jerry
jerry keeps his distance taunting let them run
just makes them easier to kill when im done with you
ding ding ding the family mans car door is open and the warning bell rings over and over
charlie eyes the car
keys still in it
he circles jerry backing him off
i repel you with the power of christ the lord
when did you take your last confession
thats a mighty big cross you have there
question is do you actually know how to use it
jerry lunges for charlie but he dives for the family mans open car door
but jerrys on him hands burning as he rips the cross from charlie and shatters it with his hand
then he tosses charlie who flies and hits janes car then crumples to the ground
jerry gets charlie around the neck holds a sharp splintered end of the broken cross against charlies chest
the wood still burns into jerrys hand but jerry holds on
ever take one of these in the chest
charlie struggles terrified
but they missed the heart
jerry positions the stake right over charlies heart
terrified and overpowered
shouldnt have been so nosey
jerrys about to plunge the stake through charlies heart when a thick wood stake comes through jerrys shoulder
jerry howls falls off charlie and we see that hes been staked by the business end of a real estate sign
jane stands over them quaking with fear and adrenaline
amys right behind her with a crowbar
leave my kid alone
jane collapses and we see that theres a lot of blood on the back of her head
jerrys in agony as he stumbles away pulls the sign post out of his shoulder
charlie grabs his mom and drags her into her wreck of a car
amy dives into the car with them
charlie presses the accelerator
will it still drive
come on come on come on
it lurches forward then goes
metal scraping the ground raining glass
but it runs
they start to bolt when bam
jerry stands up right in front of the car lunges at them
charlie runs over jerrys body again
they speed off
jerry writhes in the middle of the road
but even as he does he heals
his body knitting itself back together
charlies giving a report to a pair of uniformed cops
so a gas leak caused the fire at your home and
my mom didnt feel right we were trying to get her to the hospital
it was stupid to let her drive
yeah it was
and driver who rear ended you you get the exact make and name of the van
it wasnt there when you got there
hit and run
happens all the time
charlie stifles his surprise
on her cell pacing as she eyes charlie with the cops
we wont stay up all night
bee and cara need help with trig its not a party
i love you
she stops at the open door of a hospital room
her gaze who lies motionless in a bed
a doctor checks her chart
amy hangs up
charlie finished with the cops joins her
theyre both pained as they look at jane
maybe you should have said something to the police
a vampire moved next door borrowed some beer ate a stripper and then blew up our house because we wouldnt invite him in
amy looks at him
the doctor approaches
you should get some rest
shes going to wake up right
assuming the swelling is minimal i hope so
but you dont know
we need to give it time
the doctor puts a hand on charlies shoulder leaves
charlie turns away upset
amy watches feeling helpless
peter in a bathrobe looks out his floor to ceiling windows at the lights of the strip
the assistant from the show toddles out on high heels and a ridiculous mini dress
her hair is messy post sex
good show tonight
hes barely paying attention
you were late again on the devils torture chamber
but shes gone
he moves back toward the library shelves
as he does he notices the photos charlie took at jerrys place
absently he sifts through them
he picks up the one of the insignia
this means something to him
he goes to a wall safe
hidden inside are a bunch of personal items
some from his childhood
old photos of his mother and father
and a hand drawn sketch in a youthful scrawl of the insignia
he puts the two side by side
off peter looking at the sketches
charlie and amy sit on a tiny couch
both are scared and regretful
this is my fault
you didnt make any of it happen
ed came to me
i turned my back on him
how were you supposed to believe him
none of it makes sense
he did talk a lot of demented crap
he was my best friend
he asked me begged me to believe him
everybody yeah they do
i turned into a dick
i figured my dweeb past not big with the ladies
so youre saying this is my fault
i wanted you to like me
i tried to erase ed all of it
i know how that feels
i knew you were a dweeb
off his look you think i want a dude like mark or ben
i like that youre different
it didnt hurt that your skin cleared up
she smiles takes his hand
a sweet connected moment
then something alarming occurs to amy i cant believe we didnt have sex
im going to die a virgin
how did this happen
were not going to die but what if we do
lets do it
i think we should kill the vampire first
ill perform much better
they laugh trying not to cry
then oh my god charlie
what are we going to do
were going to fight
then charlies phone rings
peter stands with the photo of the insignia in hand
i can help you
a few minutes later
charlie and amy move out of janes room
the peter vincent
under whelming believe me
but hes what weve got
they close janes door and we see that its covered in crosses of every shape and size
its quite a spectacle
a nurse passes looks at charlie and amy quizzically
my mom is very religious
a midori cocktail widen to reveal that peter is pouring himself a whopper
amy and charlie sit nearby
ill tell you what i know but thats it
dont expect me to join your scooby gang
ill take it
i found the origin of that insignia you showed me
its a species that originated in the mediterranean
they nest in the earth explains that hole you saw
and they kill slowly keep their victims alive for days
so they turn all of them
off amys look make their victims into vampires
it takes a while before they complete the change
they usually finish them off before that
so how do you kill these guys this tribe
but its a strong breed
you need a plan a voice interrupts over an intercom
its arthur peters assistant
guy says you need to sign for something
send him in
i order things when ive had a few cocktails
its a wait
you get deliveries this late
i dont know
maybe charlie stands
you said he could come in
the delivery guy
an invitation airhead
they turn and see evil ed in one of jerrys uniforms
its clear hes changed
a glint in the eye more muscular
charlie takes ed in pained
ed grins at him
ed flips open a cell phone
looking at them now
hangs up then hes modern jerry dispensed with all that master stuff
charlie steps in front of amy
youve got a problem keep it with me
you let him get me man
ed is creeping toward charlie
you let him turn me into this
at that ed vamps
black eyes black veins
one of the cabinets shatters
ed charlie and amy spin to see peter standing by the open collection case
a small nail in his hand
hes shaking like a leaf
stay away demon
amused queens accent stay awaaaay demon
ed closes in on peter
peter looks to charlie
whatcha got there
itsy bitsy little stakey
lethal to you
got to get pretty close to use it though
peter looks at the short piece of metal in his hand
he bolts down the nearest hallway
no you dont
ed bolts after peter
charlie and amy race the other way
peter pushes a button on a doorway bolts into a panic room
ed is on his heels but just misses grabbing peter before the door closes
the powerful door closes on eds arm crushes it
ed howls as his arm severs
the door locks
but what doesnt kill him makes him stronger and crazier
a panic room
you better panic loser
you better watch your neck
peters in shock watching eds severed arm twitch on the floor
prince of darkness is a little baby man
i love it
all the fat chicks in your fan club are gonna be so bummed
he hears ed flipping out but ed doesnt show up on the
charlie runs with amy to the elevator
the control box has been ripped from the wall
oh my god oh my god
amys starting to lose it
charlie grabs her
look at me
theres another way out of here
and there are a million things to fight with in here
were going to make it
amy pulls herself together
charlie and amy race through the rooms of peters extensive collection
tracking them not far behind his stub of an arm bleeding and healing as he goes
give it up chuck
if you hadnt ended up such a dick i might have tricked you out
we could have rocked this evil shit
but you blew it
nothing but the big dirt nap for you and your lady
round a corner its a dead end
they see a large antique confessional at one end of the room
as he comes around the same corner a moment later
amy and charlie are nowhere to be seen
jerry enters his appearance different
healing from the car incident has taken it out of him
hes pale and weakened and still has lots of cuts and bruises
hes also changed into new clothes jeans and a sweater
we see the same guard that charlie spoke to earlier
sign in please
i know where im going
jerry ignores him keeps moving toward the elevator
im talking to you
sign in or youre not going nowhere
slow and deliberate
ed is moving in on the confessional
sees movement behind the curtain
i expected more of a fight
girls made you lazy in the head
pussyll do that
ed yanks the curtain on the confessional open
arthur hides there terrified
look at that
vincents got a vincent
a large cabinet on the other side of the room
amy and charlie are squeezed behind it
they react to horrible screams as ed rips arthur apart
charlie holds amy close muffling her sobs
blood seeps across the floor under their feet
his face bloodied
the trembling body of arthur on the ground at his feet
ed turns arthur over
arthurs still breathing reaches for something around his neck
no its a chain with pictures of sweet faced children on silver charms
ed lifts arthur off his feet and chokes him with one hand
dont take it personal
id eat you but im saving my appetite
arthurs turning a horrible purple eyes bulging
ed breaks his neck with a horrible wrenching crunch
dinner with an old friend
a door to a stairwell opens jerry steps into a hall
he looks healthy again
he wipes a small smear of blood from his mouth
amy and charlie hold their breath as ed looks around the room
arthur is motionless at his feet now
i know youre here
i can hear you breathing
its totally cool
he laughs hyper
sooo i take out the prom king and queen
embarrassment of riches
charlie shoves the case he hides behind with amy over onto ed
yells to amy amy bolts from the room as charlie punches the glass out on another case that holds the battle axe
he grabs the weapon
ed shoves the cabinet off him with his good hand stands
charlie and ed face off
piece of cake
cause im a god damned killing machine and youre like all the clark high big shots nothing
you picked the wrong side man
ed lashes out slicing charlie on the arm with his sharp nails
charlie yells but holds his ground
i didnt pick you didnt think
charlies wrecked about what he has to do
charlie takes a swing with the axe
ed starts bounding around the room avoiding charlies swings as he clings to walls and impossibly the ceiling
call that a swing slugger
charlie swings and swings but ed is too fast for him
finally charlie connects with eds neck
blood flies charlie cant look anguished
youre not even trying
charlie looks back eds head is only half off
hes grinning even as he bleeds everywhere
its macabre horrible
ed slashes charlie again with his claw like nails
charlie cries out
amy can hear charlie yell
she smashes into one glass cabinet after another pulling out and pocketing everything she can find to fight ed
finds a gun loaded with silver bullets
you are something arent you
jerrys closing in on her
shes shaking terrorized
bam bam bam
she empties the gun into jerry anyway
it knocks him back but hes still standing
he picks a silver bullet out of his shoulder unimpressed
amy flings holy water in his face
jerry screams burns
ed is already starting to heal as he and charlie continue to fight
but his head still flops hideously to one side
bone is a motherfucker chuckles
hard to cut
charlie takes another swing with his axe
ed jumps out of the way
ed manages to get charlie in a one arm embrace of sorts positions himself so he can bite his neck
is this weird for you too
i feel like such a homo charlie flips ed they are wrestling when charlie sees amy approaching with a spiked mace
charlie ducks and amy smashes ed in the head
charlie grabs a long sharp piece of the shattered wooden cabinet
ed is on the ground
charlie has his shot
but he hesitates
ed starts to get up his head a mess
its now or never
bimbo has some juice jerrys here
to ed pained im sorry
whap charlie stakes ed in the heart
ed looks at charlie with surprise
eds hideous features seem to dissolve
for a brief moment he looks like himself again
i wasnt even a badass vamp
i was his renfield
funny if you ed starts to vibrate horribly his whole body moving so impossibly fast hes little more than a blur
then he burns up from the inside out
charlies paralyzed in a world of hurt
amy grabs him
pulls him out of the room
i found the stairs
jerry vamp faced and recovering from the holy water sees amy and charlie running up ahead
he sprints after them
charlie sees him and topples a giant figurine in his path as well as cabinets etc
they slow jerry down enough to get slightly ahead
she flings the door to the stairwell open and they race down peter sits huddled in a corner ashamed and shaking
the security camera flicks through different rooms until it lands on his dead cousin arthur
its like peters looking at his own mutilated corpse
off peter terrified
amy and charlie emerge from the stairway
they find themselves on the floor of a hard rock type casino which is on the bottom of the building where peter lives
amy slows as they fold into the crowds
stop i need to not now
hes coming for us
he cant kill us not here whos going to notice
whos going to care
amy look around
amy takes in the people on the floor
two guys yell and fight at a craps table
a couple makes out in a dark corner etc
its loud chaotic
now charlie sees jerry some distance behind them now moving toward them in the crowd
they meet eyes
charlie grabs amy scans for someplace to hide
he spots a nightclub reflections
the outside walls are all mirrored like a brightly lit diamond
behind them in the crowd he sees them slip into the club
the inside of the club is made up of mirrors and windows
the dance floor is packed
all writhing bodies and sweaty abandon
its dizzying disorienting
charlie sees jerry enter look around for them
the best bet to get lost is to dive into the crowd
charlie leads amy through the throngs of people the different levels of the club are like a maze
glass staircases lead to mirrored balconies
a hopped up dj climbs up on a balcony starts throwing t shirts into the crowd
tequila man t shirts
the crowd goes nuts surges forward
someone bumps amy and charlie and they lose hands
charlie turns a drunk chick gets in his way tries to dance with him
he pushes past her
charlie cant see amy instead sees himself over and over again in a series of mirrors the infinity effect
its dizzying disorienting
then he sees jerry a shark moving in and out of the crowd disappearing behind mirrored columns reemerging
charlie also sees that jerry doesnt reflect in the mirrors around them
instead the crowd parts as if by magic
jerrys heading straight toward whos been pushed toward the dj stand by the crowd
shes spinning looking desperately for charlie
charlies frantically pushing toward her
but the crush of people makes it nearly impossible to gain ground
as a hand slips into hers
she turns relieved to find holding her with a firm grip
amy struggles and cries out as jerry pulls her away from charlie toward ramp that leads to another dance floor
jerry laughs throws her over his shoulder
a guy in the crowd high fives him
all part of another crazy night in vegas
go get her man
amy sees her fast moving reflection in the mirror she appears to be floating above the people
charlie can see her but cant get to her
the crowd is indifferent to her cries
charlie grabs his cell hits a button
it dials then peter
were in the casino the club
jerrys got amy
hes got peters holding his cell
he hangs up
jerry hidden away from charlie now puts amy down
she tries to run but he holds her tight
charlies coming hell find me im counting on it
amy spits on him
jerry reacts a flash of rage and he exposes his brutal rows of teeth for just an instant
he grips her harder sways with her to the music
leans close to her ear seductive
his predatory skills in high gear
you just need a taste
it can be like a dream
jerry draws a nail over his wrist draws a line of blood
he puts his mouth over the cut bloodying it
he forces her into a deep kiss
she struggles mightily but then her body relaxes as if shes been sedated
jerry looks up sees charlie coming toward them
but amys altered now
staring into jerrys eyes like a child
charlies getting closer when amy
a hand falls on his shoulder
howd you get in here
you have to help me
that guy hes going to kill her hes a the doorman glances at jerry and amy
jerry stokes charlies anguish running his hands over amys ass kissing her neck
then shes liking it
charlies beside himself enraged and terrorized
you dont understand
then you can tell me your whole sad story no
theres no time amy
charlies increasingly desperate tries to run
but the doorman has a good grip pulls him back
sees that charlie is restrained
jerry locks eyes with charlie and smiles his horrible fangs exposed
hes taking charlies woman and enjoying it
as hes being dragged away jerry brutally bites amy
its a nightmare
charlie loses it screaming and flailing
but there is no helping her
peter packs a bag getting out of town
i see you got my message
sees charlie standing in the doorway
howd you get in here
securitys a little lax
everybody got their throat ripped out
peter backs away as charlie moves in
charlie is different
like hes aged a decade in one night
he change you
look at your monitor
peter turns to a security monitor in his closet
charlie i dont know if amys alive or dead or turned but hes got her
my mom may not make it
im going to end him or hes going to end me
one way or the other thats how its going to be and youre going with me
dont you get what this is
theres no fighting
theres only surviving if youre lucky you call this surviving
if you live and we all die you think youll ever be able to get us out of your head
i know i wont
i never could not after the first time
this stops charlie
i told myself i probably made it up
i was a kid
maybe it was easier to believe in monsters
made what up
the vampire who killed my parents my brothers
but not me
surprised but now it all makes sense
peter continues haunted i didnt collect all this stuff for fun
i thought maybe i could find the tribe avenge my people
so do it
well go in at dawn
hes got to rest sometime its not like that
when i was a kid i hid because i wanted to live
i still do
this isnt the comics
you want to be a dead hero
good for you
but im out
you think im a coward
im just a realist
moment of hesitation for charlie
has he been affected by peters words
then so you bail on people erase them
i dont want to make it to tomorrow not if youre the kind of man i have to be
peter is full of self loathing but resolved
charlie turns to leave
peter takes something from his luggage
a stake carved from white wood
he hands it to charlie
blessed by saint michael
kill a vampire with it its supposed to turn his victims back
if amys changed you can still save her
if its for real
who knows whats for real any more
charlie takes the stake
starts to go
peter stops him theres no guarantee hell be asleep during the day
hes housebound not hibernating
ill figure it out
no you need a plan
to stake him you have to get close hes stronger than you
slow him down
wont stop him
torch him youll have a few good minutes before he really goes up
believe me a vampire on fire isnt thinking clearly
but if hes on fire how do i get close enough to stake him
you just worry about yourself
with that charlie leaves
disgusted with himself
charlie sits by janes bedside
shes still comatose
we move closer and see that charlies drawing a map of jerrys house on some scrap paper laying it out from memory as best he can
he glances at the clock as it ticks toward da as charlie plots he talks to jane his silent confidante
those rooms upstairs thats probably where hes got amy
i get her out assuming shes then i have to get him on the ropes
then looks up an idea occurring
jane lies there peacefully
i have to go
more energized charlie stands and gathers his things
he stops contemplates his mother for a moment regretful
im coming back for you mom
charlie buys fireproof clothing a small open flame lighter and a spray canister like the kind an exterminator uses
the guy at the counter looks charlie up and down
charlie takes this in
finally charlies like fuck it
going to kill a vampire
the guy looks at him
then good for you
the store guy waits
charlie hands over his money
looming silhouetted against early morning light
next to it charlies house stands in charred ruins
charlie stands on the front lawn contemplating the houses
he wears fireproof clothes has stakes and crosses strapped to him holsters made out of duct tape
slung over his shoulder is the spray canister
and he holds a crowbar in a free hand
he looks like something out of one of eds graphic novels
before he enters charlie douses himself in holy water
lets do this shit
he swallows hard scared but determined
widen to find charlie cautiously moving through the house
the blacked out windows give the place a gray stifled air
behind charlie we see that the front door has been broken open with the crow bar
charlie anxiously looks around for jerry fully expecting him to jump out and go for his throat
he takes the stairs up to the second floor two at a time
charlie moves down the hall stops at some of the small rooms
finally charlie hears a groan
he opens a window in the door for yet another room
amys lying on the floor turned away from him
charlies not sure what hell see when he gets a better look at her
amy slowwwwly gets up turns
and aside from a bruised bite mark on her neck she looks normal
she rushes to charlie keeps her voice down
she reaches through the window
they link hands emotional
you shouldnt be here where is he
i dont know
he dumped me here
he said so how do you feel
please get out of here
hes too strong im stronger
in a nerd power way
he reaches into his jacket pulls out a cross
it should he looks up
amy is gone
calls out in a hushed panic amy
its like she vaporized
charlie races down a hallway looking for any
he tries door after door that wont open
he finally finds one door thats unlocked rushes through almost falls through an open floor in an unfinished portion of the house
jerrys building more cells
charlie backs out of the doorway turns a corner and bam
he runs into jerry
no wait its peter
hes not wearing his wig etc
but hes cleaned up and standing tall
dressed all in black
you sorry howd you a beat
then guess i dont want to be a man like me either
peter opens his leather coat its loaded with weapons
and a flask
lets kill something
dont get greedy
and i found something else
from my collection
from around his back he reveals a double barrelled shotgun with a cross mounted on the barrel
no you think im fucking macgyver
theyll buy us some time
charlie is grateful but nows not the time for man hugs
we have to find amy
she was in a room upstairs then she just disappeared
this house what do you mean she disappeared
she was there
i looked away looked back she was gone
peter takes this in
show me where
peter and charlie pry open the door to the room where amy was held
peter walks over the floor finds a trap door
i use it all the time
where does it go
only one way to find out
peter lowers himself into the hole under the trap door wait youre going in
like a great date
get me drunk and ill try anything
peter lets go and falls
charlie steels himself goes in after him
charlie and peter land painfully on a dirt floor
they look around eyes adjusting
theres barely any light
theyre in a large unfinished basement
the floor is dirt and the main story of the house is held up by numerous at the far end of the basement there is a door that leads to
another room storage area
as he sees something
a mound of dirt
like a grave
charlie indicates to peter to follow him
they whisper you uncover him
ill light him up then stake him
charlie pulls a fabric mask like a ski mask over his face
peter looks at him
theyre standing over the grave now
charlie nods to peter
peter does his best to hold the shotgun on the grave as he pushes the dirt aside with his free hand
after a moment peter uncovers part of the body
then he moves up toward the face
charlie douses the body with liquid from the canister
you should be a magician
as the face emerges charlie readies a match then reaches for his stake stop
no charlie stops just as hes about to toss the match
who is that
its adam sleeping in a shallow dirt grave
he pushes his mask back
i know him
dont wake him up for peter stops
hes looking over charlies shoulder horrified
in the dirt behind charlie are more graves
eight or ten at least
sees the graves
you know them too
charlie reacts stunned
peter moves to another grave uncovers another sleeping face
and then another
a hulking man a suburban mom
charlie uncovers another body
my geometry teacher
she was hard up
how about we go back to my run away plan
we cant burn jerry out
theres no way well get all these people out if the house goes up
i thought youre here for amy
off charlies look great
save the geometry a scream stops him
charlie and peter spin its coming from behind the door to the other room
theyre both petrified as they move toward the door
peter readies the gun again
charlie pulls a cross out along with the stake
they creep toward the door
charlie puts his hand on the doorknob
charlies violently shoved through the door into the storage area charlie hits the dirt hard
the door slams shut and locks behind him
hes in a smaller room with a large dirt grave in the middle
peters confronted by jerry
who smiles darkly
you look bigger on tv
peter fires the shotgun blam
but he misses jerry and the power of the blast sends peter
charlie reacts to the blast but sees that st
michaels stake has fallen from his hand and rolled to the edge of the grave
he cautiously moves to retrieve it
he stops as he sees a figure emerge from the dark
her clothes are torn now a thin trickle of blood runs down her neck
she looks impossibly sexy
her hair her eyes her lips all shining and full
forgetting himself he goes to her
pulls her into his arms
she clings to him near tears
peter scrambles on the ground shotgun trained on jerry who moves toward him calmly
the cross on the gun the only thing holding him back
peter fires again grazes jerry
in pain he transforms and vamps before our eyes with a blood curdling yell
one by one the tribe of vampires wake
amy pulls away from charlie says you should have run with me while we had the chance
you should have saved me charlie
charlie takes this in pained
then its not too late
she brings her lips close to his ear
hes inside me now
her eyes go dark fingernails grow sharp and dig into charlie
he feels the change
charlie shoves her off hard
but she holds him tight and they tumble into the grave
jerry backed by adam ms
granada and a handful of other vampires closes in on peter
its over guy
charlie his girls having her way with him
shes way out of his league anyway
peter trapped wont be able to keep them at bay much longer
desperate he blasts them again
hits one on the shoulder
but its not stopping them
and your aim you dont get it
im on your side
peter smiles a little
shows his rows of sharp fangs
jerry and the others stop
amy and charlie struggle
he reaches for his cross but she throws him off her with a violent hiss
charlie gets his first look at amy in full vampire glory
shes even more freaky looking than jerry or ed
her face is nearly overtaken by a wide mouth filled with razor sharp teeth
her eyes are crazed and blood red
its gruesome and terrifying
charlie sees the stake at the lip of the hole
dives for it
amys on him in a flash
she throws him to the ground
hes got the stake in hand
ready to strike
she straddles him sexual and raw
charlies repulsed terrified
ill be the best you ever had
the only you had
we can be together forever
she leans in licks his neck seductively
she sits back the stake in her chest
she falls away shuddering
charlie pulls the stake out scrambles out of the nest
he looks back at her anguished
amy in terrible pain laughs
charlie breaks the door open with his crowbar
he backs away from her
into the basement where jerry and the the tribe are circled around a body as ms
on peter whos pale and shaking
charlie attacks them with the crowbar
get off him
he hits ms
granada off peter
manages to hold off jerry for a beat
spins and hits adam in the head
amy enters from the other room already healing
jerry sees her holds up a hand and backs the others off
ill finish this
jerry all swagger moves in on charlie
charlie sees peter barely alive spit out his fake vamp teeth
peter meets his gaze wry and weak
worth a shot
master of illusion
now charlie notices shotgun not far from peters body
he dives for it but jerry steps on it kicks it away
you think thats going to stop me
time to man up
jerry brutally kicks charlie sends him sprawling
im going to kill your girl make you watch
ill take my time with you
and once youre dead ill finish your mother
too bad about that one
she sucked me dry
like a pro
amy smiles a little
jerry grabs charlie lifts him off his charlie enraged sprays jerry with gas from the canister right in the eyes
jerry recoils hissing
adam and the other vamps move in
jerrys over it
hes on charlie in a flash fangs bared
about to rip his neck out
peter has the gun again has managed to pull himself up into a sitting position
he blows away one of the support beams
blam he misses
charlie dives for safety as the ceiling collapses in part of the basement
sunlight streams in forcing jerry amy and the other vamps into a corner
nice sweater loser
another beam collapses
burying jerry amy and the others under debris from the floor above
a stunned beat
peter slumps exhausted from the effort
charlie looks at him amazed
im better with stationary targets
yeah you are
peter looks at him sad
get out of here
we dont have much time before they dig out
i can save you
i have to kill him with this
youre a brave mother i get it
and you were right
this is how i had to go
but we didnt count on an army
hell kill you both he said were already dead
go now you live to fight another day
stay there wont be one
its what he has to do
he starts digging
but charlie ignores him determined
pulls his mask down over his face again
jerry bursts out of the rubble attacks charlie
charlie falls back pulling jerry with him into the light jerry bursts into flame but holds charlie tight amy and the other vamps start to claw their way out of
charlie and jerry fight nearly engulfed in flames now charlie
peter gets up painfully moves to help
raging and desperate charlie and jerry continue to battle
finally jerry pulls charlie down with him rolls on the ground as they fight
trying to put out the flames
jerry starts to disintegrate hes about to explode into bits
charlies stake is now on fire
a last desperate attempt
he can see jerrys heart about to burn away
amy suddenly screams shes burning inside dying
or so it seems
the vampire is being burned out of her
peter cries out too reacting less violently
but in pain
still burning looks down as the stake of saint michael in his chest
right through the heart
he starts to shake violently faster and faster just like ed did becoming little more than a macabre blur
for a moment jerrys human form hangs in the air
thinking fast peter tackles charlie who is still in flames
they tumble into one of the open graves
dirt pours in around them extinguishing the fire
transformed and healed
she rushes to the edge of the open grave
peter pulls charlies mask back
charlie is burned unconscious
she crawls into the grave
cradles charlie in her arms
amy starts to cry
peter looks on concerned
finally charlie opens his eyes
peter falls back exhausted
those are his last words
what a tool
we pull away leaving this tableau
until adam ms
granada and the other members of the tribe emerge from the rubble
lets agree to never talk about this
charlie amy jane and peter are in peters penthouse
its a glittering night a spectacular view
jane released from the hospital looks healthy and glowing
she smiles at peter who also looks more together
she has a glass of wine hes drinking a coke
think youll ever feel the same about a nighttime sky
same as what
i was always terrified
were just catching up
charlie sees the connection between peter and jane
im not seeing that
she deserves some fun
your mom fully cheated death
you deserve fun
oh i plan on it
now that youve killed your first vampire
i am so going to perform
charlie kisses her
its intense passionate
its different theyre different
the childish part of them long gone
he runs his hands through her hair pulls her close
something beeps talks
what is that
charlie a little sheepish shows her
hes wearing a battlestar galactica wrist watch
it was eds
amy smiles a little softens
peter is passing
is down with it
perfect woman can i get you a drink
ill take another
ill give you a hand
charlie follows peter into the dining room where a bar cart is set up
peter moves to it
pours himself a midori
i thought you were on the wagon
off his look im on the day wagon
thanks for inviting us
we should celebrate
your moms clean bill of health
you wanted to put the moves on her
just im watching you
ive got to look out for her
yeah you do
so heres what im thinking
we faced the beast and we won
can you imagine the possibilities if we had got that shit on film
show up on film yeah
but werewolves do bigfoots do
we get proof catch something we could build a stage act around that you wouldnt believe
wed blow those cirque bitches away
what about saving people from evil
what a chilling laugh interrupts them
and somehow familiar
peter nods to his collection cabinets
all this stuff
ever think about collecting something else
snow globes or charlie stops catches sight of something moving in the just a wisp a phantom
the face is it ed
his features twisted in a grimace of fear and pain
but he looks again and the face is gone
yeah definitely get new stuff
peter leads charlie out back to the ladies in the other room
still on about his idea
im serious man
do you know how much we could make
think about how much people pay to see a tiger or boobs right
what if we had a tiger boobs and a zombie
after theyve gone we linger on the window
is that eds eerie reflection again
youre so coooool brewster
