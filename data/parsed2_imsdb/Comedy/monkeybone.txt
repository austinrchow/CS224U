written by sam hamm based on the comic book dark town by kaja blackley and vanessa chong over black screen with portentous spooky music underneath
just as the music reaches its crescendo we hear a simian screech
a buck toothed cartoon monkey swings past on a vine
title wipes in with him monkeybone tm in a pocketwatch swings back and forth in f
gaping at it is a goofy bespectacled cartoon character sucking his thumb as his eyes move back and forth
after a moment the left eye freezes in place but the right eye keeps going back and forth with the watch
shrinks voice o
youre going back
back to when it all began
are you going back yet
come on get back ve havent got all day
now both eyes are locked in place
the patient is hypnotized
a squat lumpy teacher miss hudlapp is straining to erase the gettysburg address which is written along the very top of the blackboard
theres an obtrusive rhythmic banging noice in b
it was third grade
the teacher was miss hudlapp
she was kinda squat and lumpy she smelled funny but she was kind
turning around suddenly how many times have i told you
in this class we do not pound tenpenny nails into stanleys head
hapless ten year old stanley still goofy and bespectacled in his front row desk
nails stick out of his head
the four mean kids poised around him lower their hammers and return to their seats grumbling
a dreamy smile crosses stanleys face as he gazes at miss hudlapp
you know how some teachers have those kind of flaps on their arms those big sacks of limp flab that like dangle
as miss hudlapp pulls her sweater off two massive arm flaps fifty gallons of flab apiece spill out and smack into the floor
miss huddlapp claps two erasers together kicking up a cloud of dust
young stanley watches transfixed by her massive arm flaps
we track in on the gigantic arm flaps as they swing hypnotically back and forth with a loud slap each time they collide
it sounds weird
but for some reason as i watched those big old flaps of hers i began to feel
now we track in on the mesmerized stanley
a song comes up underneath donna summer i feel love
beat and then the horror began
stanley looks down at his lap in horror
the boys and girls around him are pointing and tittering
grimacing in embarrassment he discreetly places a heavy textbook onto his lap suppressing the bulge in his pants
the book goes flying across the room
the bulge is fighting back
the kids duck and cover beneath their desks as stanley slams a stack of textbooks onto his lap
its no use the whole stack goes flying and books come raining down on the entire class
now miss hudlapp is staring directly at him
whats that in your lap
she marches toward him
stanley pulls his backpack over his lap
it was useless
like putting a baseball cap on the washington monument
all at once there he was
the backpack bucks and wriggles as if something inside is trying to get out
and then with a flourish of rousing disco strings it does
the libidinous cartoon monkey bursts out of the backpack points at miss hudlapp and announces in his barry white baritone oooo oo ooh baby
i love your way
kc and the sunshine band comes up underneath as monkeybone dances to the front of the class
he grabs miss hudlapp by the hands and begins dancing the bump with her arm flaps
butt left whap
butt right whap
the kids are bug eyed agog
with each whap their little heads turn back and forth as if theyre watching a nude tennis match
a roomful of live humans watching the cartoon heads turning in sync with the kids onscreen
tv industry hipsters ad execs manufacturers reps
theyre all guests at this sneak preview of the monkeybone show and theyre laughing uproariously
in the midst of the crowd is a handsome young couple julie mcelroy and stu miley
julies a research scientist brainy professional abnormally well adjusted and pretty enough that shed be intimidating if it werent for a prominent goofy streak
stu is the one guy in the auditorium who isnt laughing at the cartoon on the screen
in fact hes solemn as a judge peering nervously around to see how the rest of the audience is responding
because hes the cartoonist who created the characters on screen
in his looks gangly disheveled and manner sardonic self deprecating hes the obvious model for the character of stanley
as the monkey dance continues we zoom in on the mortified face of little stanley
his eyes begin doing the familiar hypno swirl
a cuckoo pops out of a wall clock
adult stanleys thumb pops out of his mouth
he awakens from his trance in a cold sweat
how about it doc
can you help me
these imaginary monkey cases take time
i vould estimate
on the desk is a catalogue open to a two page spread depicting a foot cabin cruiser
new for summer
with his free hand the shrink is working a calculator
twelve years and three months ought to do it
the shrink hustles stanley to the door and shakes his hand
one question doc what did you mean when you said imaginary
all in good time my boy
all in good time
the shrink shoves stanley out and slams the door behind him
then he doubles over weeping with laughter
vot a crackpot
monkey on ze back hah
roll now he notices a backpack which stanley has left on the couch
it twitches slightly of its own free will
a window shatters
the shrink comes hurtling out
monkeybone straddles him like slim pickens riding an h bomb hootin and hollerin all the way down to the street
a gob of gore hits stanley in the face as he exits the building
he kneels on the sidewalk finding a pipe and a goatee
at this rate ill never find a good shrink
those guys are a waste of money
ill show you how to stop sucking your thumb
monkeybone sticks his thumb in his butt as he and stanley toddle off into the sunset
standing o from the crowd as the cartoon ends and the lights come up
herb an all purpose sidekick type appears at the podium thank you
thats our pilot
the good news is comedy channel has just picked us up with an order for six new episodes
herb leads a round of applause
julie nudges stu the only guy in the room whos still in his seat
now lets give it up for the guy who started it all
creator of americas most disturbed comic strip
the man behind the monkey
mister stu miley
a spotlight hits him and he stands to tumultuous applause
he looks genuinely stunned
he cant believe its happening
julie surreptitiously pinches him on the bottom giving him a start
she winks at him
he shoots her a small private smile then turns to wave at the adoring crowd
stu working his way through a crowd of well wishers and fans
i dont actually draw all the animation no
we have sweatshop workers who couldnt get jobs at nike doing that
a beautiful heavily pierced female fan hands stu a marker
miley would you draw monkeybone on my belly
as a guide
for my tattoo artist
she exposes her taut midriff
stu thinks for a moment then goes to work
when hes done monkeybone appears to be climbing out of the girls pants and waving to her
nearby fans applaud
you have to draw the rest of him she begins unbuckling her belt so stu will have enough room to draw monkeybones bottom half
i i have to uh check in with my doctor
do he wanders across the room finds julie deep in conversation with a bunch of other guests and pulls her aside
theres something really cool i want to show you
he grabs her by the sleeve pulls her across the floor to theres nothing cool about it its a stairway landing with metal fire doors that open onto the parking
see these doors
the cool thing is you go out they close
you cant get back in
he opens one door and holds it for julie
you want to leave
but stu youre a big hit
everyone loves you
they dont love me
they love monkeybone
it was you who got the standing o
it was you drawing on the belly over there
that was especially monkeybone
come on doc i dont want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps
i just want to be us
conspiratorially i have something i have to give you
cant you give it to me later
yeah i could but the thing is if later got here sooner it would be
he gives up trying to explain
pulls her close and kisses her
for a moment they completely forget about the party in the next room
then herb appears behind them trying to catch stus eye as he waits for the clinch to break up
finally he pries them apart sorry julie wont be a minute
now stu i know you dont like the idea but you really ought to talk to these guys julie and i we were just gonna go
but before stu knows whats hit him herb is leading him back to go
theres a potload of money here pal
you got three major toy companies
you got the guys from burger god over here
the ones that found the pig hair in the french fries
theyre ready to pop for a pre emptive endorsement
kids love burger god the merchandisers shoot stu an expectant wave
stu waves back and turns in the opposite direction
herb grabs him by the sleeve
herb its too much
its all out of hand
do you know what kind of opportunity you have here
you gotta strike
im talking mansions
champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth
i dont want to be rich
its just a trap
being rich is not a trap
that is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them
i have to go
i got the ring
beat tonights the night herb
tonights the night
he nods toward julie whos at the open bar grabbing two glasses of punch
herb realizes a proposal is in the works
oh my god
my life was totally crappy herb and she
she made me happy
which id never been
she loves me the way i am right now
beat i dont want everything to change
i dont want her saying yes to some big success
i just want her saying yes to me
in some weird way i respect that
julies over by the punchbowl
she sees the two boys staring at her conspiratorially makes a face at them as she waves back
if i get you out of here you pop the question tonight
stu nods gravely
stu julie and herb in the parking lot
a small safari of flunkies is loading enormous boxes full of monkeybone junk into stus beat up car stuffed dolls action figures board games lunchboxes beach towels team jackets and
stu groans at the sight of it
theyre just prototypes
take em home and look at em before you say no
scanning the streets if you could just hold on a minute or two were expecting a couple more trucks
stu glowers at herb as he opens the car door for julie
youre a beautiful couple
stu backs out of his space
the small parking lot is full of delivery trucks from would be merchandisers all too large for the spaces theyre parked in
stu has to keep backing up because the exit lanes are blocked
its like negotiating a labyrinth
look at this
he wont let us leave
hell take over both our lives if we let him
stu stop it
that monkey is good luck
you thought him up and everybody loves him and hes probably going to make you rich
its weird thats all
i never had any good luck until i met you
what if its all just another bad dream
whats the bad part
i might wake up
laughing taking his hand if you do ill be right there beside you
so face it
youre just going to have to be happy
i am happy
it just so happens this is the happiest night of my life
he says it so solemnly that she cracks up
after a moment he joins in
a plastic banner stretches between two poles on either side of the entry to the lot
it shows monkeybone in a typical languorous pose its his world
we just live in it
sunday nights this fall two guys on extension ladders are taking the sign down as stus car idles at the exit below
theres a strong wind tonight and one guy loses hold of his end of the banner just as he gets it detached
as stu pulls into the intersection he sees a delivery truck approaching in the opposite lane with a cardboard likeness of monkeybone mounted atop the cab
that damn monkey is everywh suddenly his view of the street disappears
the monkeybone banner has fallen directly across his windshield like a huge shroud
all he can see is a great grinning monkey face
unable to see he slams on the brakes and off screen horns blaring
the horrible crunch of metal but stus car comes to a halt untouched
after a moment he opens his eyes
and julie opens hers
did we just hit something
i dont think so
are you okay
she thinks it over nods
stu takes a moment to catch his breath then opens the door gingerly
a horn blares as a car speeds past in the opposite lane nearly taking stus door off
he jumps back inside waits opens the door again
his eyes widen in horror as he steps out to survey the scene
the asphalt is strewn with monkeybone merchandise stuffed dolls games lunchboxes
skid marks show where the truck which was carrying all this and slammed into the rear of a buick regal pinning it up against a telephone pole
stu races up to the buick
its front end is mashed up like an accordion but the occupants a couple of teenagers dressed for the prom seem to be okay
are you guys all right in there
that stupid monkey banner
it fell on my windshield it practically killed us all
to julie god julie if anything had happened to you im fine baby
were all okay
we were lucky
id better go report this
he spots a phone booth and starts across the street
on the way there he plucks a stuffed monkeybone doll off the pavement and chokes it with both hands
julie stays behind with the prom kids
the teenage boy in his tux is glassy eyed miserable beyond description
the boy begins to sob softly
julie nods in sympathy
then everyone winces
the air is full of a horrible creaking noise like nails on a blackboard
what was that
did you hear that
the horrible creaking noise continues
behind her the telephone pole that the car slammed into is beginning to teeter
then it topples
he sees julie running toward him and holds up a single finger
i want to report an accident
finally he glances up just in time to see the telephone pole coming down toward the phone booth like a gigantic sledgehammer
his eyes widen
the stuffed monkeybone slips from his grasp
a horrible crash
camera zeroes in on the monkeybone doll which stu was holding surrounded by broken glass its face twisted into an insane almost macabre grin
the screen fades to pitch black for a few seconds
until we hear a distant siren and an image comes swimming into focus
hes in the back of an ambulance with paramedics all around him working feverishly
julie hovers above him holding his hand
im here baby
i love you
youre gonna be okay baby i promise all at once he seems to be receding from julie and the others as if sinking through the bottom of the stretcher and
beyond through the floor of the ambulance
julies voice grows weaker more distant im here baby
i wont leave you
and then all trace of the ambulance is gone and hes floating down through some strange limbo surrounded by the silhouettes of billowing shrouds with the sound of birds calling
all around him
an awful mechanical ratcheting noise fills the soundtrack
stus eyes close and when they reopen he finds himself in a tiny roller coaster car descends from dense clouds down the length of an impossibly long and rickety metal
the track leads through a vast black void
to a tiny island floating in the darkness
an island that looks not unlike a disembodied fist
and as the car draws closer the fist begins to open tulip like turning into a hand with a full sized town nestled in its palm
in the town carnival lights begin to glitter
music begins to tinkle
the car a one passenger job with a cartoon animal face on its prow stops with a lurch
stu steps out onto a fog shrouded train station platform
before he knows it the little car departs behind him
hes stranded alone
am i dead
beat off in the fog is a big wheeled cart with the sign psychological baggage claim
there stu finds two suitcases and a backpack
he examines the tags
they all belong to him
he sits on the edge of the cart opens a suitcase and pulls out
a bagged copy of marvel comics conan the barbarian an mm reel of highlights from ray harryhausens jason and the argonauts with swordfighting skeletons on the box cover a spiral
notebook its cover labelled stu m
geography its inside pages covered with drawings of dinosaurs and airplanes transparent plastic models of the visible man and his mate the visible woman with a couple of spare organs
that young stu never quite found a place for a vinyl lp of breads greatest hits which stu quickly slips back into the suitcase lest anyone see it
as he gathers his bags he hears odd squeaks and chittering
carry your bags mister
a strange furry creature pops out from beneath the platform and yanks on stus pants leg
it looks like a raccoon but its flat an animated pelt
before stu has time to let out a yell a flat snakeskin comes slithering out from beneath the baggage cart
stu looks down and sees a squashed rabbit humping his leg
wanna meet my sister
these bordertown types are known as roadkill and theyre sporting the tire tracks to prove it
stu screams shakes them off and runs
a long stone stairway leads to decorative wrought iron gates
shadowy carved sphinxes sit on either side
as stu races up the steps a sputtering neon sign comes to life overhead a fanfare blows as the creaky gates begin to part
a spotlight hits the sphinxes and they come to life
they rise up on their hind legs put on boater hats
one of them blows a note on a kazoo
welcome you to dark town and while youre in your coma this odd amusement park town will be your home sweet homa stu bolts through the gates with the roadkill
trio right on his heels
the indignant sphinxes exchange a look of outrage
its a carny town a tourist trap seedy and nightmarish
despite the festive trappings theres something off about it an air of neglect and decrepitude as if theyd tried to turn alcatraz into disneyland and given up halfway through
stu looks back and sees the roadkill gaining on him
he spots a small group of other humans
they the humans just yawn
theyre coma victims just like stu
he ditches one of his suitcases as the roadkill come after him
pony ride mister
he turns and spots a helpful looking fellow in a cowboy outfit
the cowboy is in fact a centaur rider and mount rolled into one
the characters who run this place the barkers ticket takers and ride operators are all weird hybrids part human part animal
they could be the ancient gods of some primitive culture reduced to working as street entertainers in this ramshackle resort town
stu pinballs down the street bouncing from one shock to another joe camel doing community service as a street sweeper hey mister
got a smoke
a yeti selling sno cones from a cart outside the morpheum theatre
the marquee reads first run continuous performances popular prices rated nr h not recommended for humans a cyclops working as a barker at the penny arcade a video rental outlet
bad dreams video offering your favorite nightmares cult and classic three nights for
a three headed devil emerges from the shop carrying a sackful of videos and recognizes stu much to his horror
hey arent you stu miley
were big fans
could we have your autograph
reduced to babbling hysteria stu ducks into the nearest building
above the door an animated neon sign shows a happy boozer lifting his martini glass then falling over flat on his back at which point his eyes are replaced by
the traditional cartoon xs
this is the coma bar
stu bursts in flattens himself against the wall as the roadkill skitter past outside
hes given them the slip
he looks around
the bars a weird melange of styles
coma victims ride around in wheelchairs refurbished as bumper cars drinking cocktails from iv bottler
a four armed elephant god is at the mighty wurlitzer while a mermaid vocalist in a half shell belts out the wistful lyrics of johnny mercers dream
and over at the bar
new in town huh
whatre you drinking
out of breath stu edges toward the bar as the bartender bull turns away to grab a fresh glass
chasing me animals horrible animals
what kind of animals
bull is a full fledged minotaur body of a man head of a bull
his features are cubist weirdly squashed over to one side
yeah i know picasso
thats what everybody says although personally i dont see the resemblance
what are you drinking
olive or eyeball
where exactly am i
land of nightmares
yeah ive seen a few of your dreams
youre quite a celebrity down here
stu gives him a cockeyed look
bull points to a monitor mounted over the bar on which a panicked man in pajamas is trying to run barefoot through a great sticky sea of molasses
i told you its the land of nightmares
same on every channel
all the stuff people dream after they have the extra anchovies
he changes channels with a remote
now we see a guy falling through midair arms and legs flailing falling falling falling
jeez it all looks like bad late night cable
sad commentary huh
now a small muffled voice speaks from the area of stus backpack disembodied voice o
whats your last name shit
turning angrily to stu i beg your pardon
i didnt say anything
you were in a bullfight with a mack truck
stu claps both hands over his mouth to prove hes not the one talking
bull glowers at him snorting steam out of both nostrils
i was uh just getting ready to leave
we got us some kind of ventriloquist here
the elephant god from the wurlitzer organ comes lumbering over
well hello sailor
get a lot of dates with that ding dong on your face
bull and jumbo rear back to punch stus lights out
hes saying his prayers when his backpack begins to bulge and quiver and a small furry beast pops out cackling his head off
just kiddin folks
drinks for everybody pointing at stu on him
bull and jumbo back off stunned
the monkey grabs stus face and plants a big wet smooch right on his nose
tight on an eeg monitor
theres a sudden blip on the readout
just a spike maam
its perfectly natural with coma patients
im a doctor too
i know this mans brain julie strokes stus limp hand
hes comatose cocooned in a tangle of wires and tubes
his head and shoulders are heavily bandaged
hes hooked up to as much machinery as you can cram into one room
go home doctor
come back when you can do us some good
dead on her feet julie stumbles toward the exit
as shes leaving she passes the waiting room julie
she turns and sees an older colleague from work alice waiting in the doorway
hovering right behind alice is herb
and behind him it appears that almost everyone in the waiting room is a friend of julie and stus
disheveled and groggy they rouse themselves and make their way over to julies side
shes overcome with emotion
the sound of the key in the lock is met by insane barking
julie and alice enter and are met by buster the pet basset jumping and yipping like crazy after hours without food or human company
now dont pick a fight
im staying over
oh poor buster
he hasnt been fed in a day and a half
let me get some food
alice kneels to play with the dog
she hears a sudden gasp from the kitchen
julie is standing by the open refrigerator wearing an absolutely stricken expression
alice finds julie holding a bottle of champagne veuve clicquot la grande dame all wrapped up in a bow and ribbon
i dont know
i guess it was
she bursts into tears
alice sits her down at the kitchen table and takes the champagne from her
dont get all poignant
were keeping this bottle on ice
when he comes around youre going to need it
a limp julie soaking in a steamy tub one arm dangling over the side
on the vanity is a framed photo strip four poses for a dollar
in the first three stu and julie are making outrageously goony faces
in the fourth they imitate the stern faced farm couple from american gothic
she gazes at it for a long long time
eventually she smiles
open on two photos mounted in a single frame
on the left buster keaton droopy eyed in his familiar porkpie hat and vest
on the right a photoshopped image of buster the bassett hound in the same pose also wearing keatons hat and vest
these photos are on the wall of the cramped room which serves as stus studio and julies office
monkeybone strips are scattered across the drafting table
alice is making up the sofa as a guest bed
as shes hanging her coat in the closet she comes across an acrylic canvas in the back stashed behind a battered portfolio and a box full of spiral bound sketchbooks
she pulls it out
shes obviously disturbed by it but she cant tear her eyes away
shes still gaping at the painting when julie enters in a terrycloth robe
who did this
that was right about the time we met
when he first came in to the sleep lab
before your time
the canvas depicts a group of surgeons with the faces of wolves
theyre standing over a human patient replacing his internal organs with machine parts
the style is at once cartoony and unsettling
he always joked about you curing him but i never realized what you cured him from
he hadnt gotten a good nights sleep in years
the nightmares would wake him up and hed start right in painting
chuckling that boy looked like pluperfect hell
alices gaze goes from the nightmare paintings to the monkeybone strips tacked up over the drafting table
how do you get from here to there
it was bicameral disjunction right brain and left brain out of balance
he was a rightie so i made him switch the pencil to his left hand
just to see whatd come out
a smile comes to julies face
she settles in on the floor beside alice and digs through the various portfolios until she comes up with a quickie cartoon on the back of a napkin the prototype
left handed he was funny
hed been doing all this scary intense work
then he found out he could draw this stuff and make me laugh and he liked that
shrugging and then the nightmares just
wow two guys in the same brain
which one did you fall in love with
julie smiles at the cartoon
she isnt telling
ive put a ton of work into that boy alice
i am not going to let him get away from me
julie in her white lab coat wanders through intensive care and finds a woman hunched over stus bed bawling her eyes out
kimmy looks up
shes crying so much she can barely recognize julie
my poor stu
my poor baby brother
whend you get in
an hour ago
gathering herself i tried to prepare myself but i didnt know he would be like like this
i cant even bear to look at him
how about you
im fine kimmy
i had so much i always wanted to say to him
at least he had a chance to give you the ring
the engagement ring
he asked me to send it to him julie turns to look at stu in the bed
the certain knowledge that he was about to propose is like a knife in her heart
kimmy feels bad as well having let the cat out of the bag but before they can hash it out mrs
he shakes hands with the women then checks stus readouts making notations on his clipboard
vital signs have stabilized
can you give us a realistic sense of my brothers chances
hes held on this far
we cant do much but wait and see
machines are whats keeping him alive is that right
this remark sends a shiver down julies spine but she keeps silent
at the moment yes
can you give me a realistic idea
of how long this is going to last
comas are unpredictable
he could wake up today tomorrow a month from now
honey i have to clarify this
the thing is dr
edelstein my brother has an absolute horror of doctors hospitals needles all of it kimmy he doesnt know whats going on
he doesnt even know hes in a please julie
this is not easy for me
our father took a long time to die
a long time
it just about killed us all
and stu and i made a pact that when our time came we wouldnt let it drag out
its too soon even to talk about that
give me a date doctor
pause theres always some brain damage
but at three months
the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day
i want him to have every chance doctor
we can certainly give it
no one says anything
but both women look at stu and then at each other and everyone knows exactly where everyone else stands
julie has a sinking feeling that stu is working on a month deadline
a beauty pageant shapely ingenues in evening gowns being introduced by an emcee with enormous teeth
and now the last of our five finalists
george is a pudgy shmoe with a small pencil mustache whos wearing glasses a necktie and nothing else
he steps forward holding a briefcase in front of his crotch looking extremely mortified
and now george will give us his analysis of heisenbergs uncertainty principle as it pertains to third world economics
camera pulls back and we realize were in where bull the bartender and a number of patrons are watching georges nightmare on the tv mounted over the bar
onscreen nude george is sweating bullets
he has no idea what to say and the audience is beginning to laugh at him
in a desperate feeble attempt to buy time
he begins to sing
im gonna wash that man right outta my hair
in fact he goes into a little softshoe keeping the briefcase poised over his crotch
unfortunately the case pops open dumping frilly lingerie all over the stage
the weeping george must crawl around on all fours to retrieve it
by now the onlookers at the bar are cracking up
all except one the lonely disconsolate fellow on the last stool nursing a martini stu
hey stu why so glum
everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare
three months bull
three months tonight
three months since the accident and im no closer to going home than i was then
aw buck up
have another tini
im sick of martinis
im sick of the waiting and the carnival rides and watching peoples nightmares
and of course i need not add he grimaces at monkeybone whos stretched out atop the mighty wurlitzer at the other end of the room
the mermaid chanteuse is singing a dietrich number the laziest gal in town or at least trying to because monkeybone is caterwauling behind her
by the time she gets to the grand finale hes practically baying at the moon
pissed off she shakes her fist at monkeybone and pulls the lid of her clamshell shut
this suits monkeybone just fine as it leaves him alone in the spotlight to soak up what little applause there is
thank you thank you for that very modest response
i know youre all in comas but still
its dedication time
he gestures to jumbo the elephant organist who begins to vamp
weve got a special dedication tonight
this ones from my ever lovin boss mr
stu mopey i mean miley and were sendin it up to a very special lady in the land of the living
yes i do mean julie the beautiful miss julie who if she has a brain in her head is shacked up right now with some good lookin doc she met
in the e
pointing at stu just kidding buddy
because if we know anything about miss julie we know she is faithful loyal and true
even if her boyfriend is an eggplant
which is why were dedicating
this very special tune
jumbos tasteful vamping gives way to a raunchy rock beat and monkeybone begins strutting across the top of the piano bumping and grinding and shaking his booty to the tune
of mah baby does the hanky panky
mah baby does the hanky panky
monkeybone sings the same poignant line over and over until stu comes storming over from the bar and yanks him off the wurlitzer by the scruff of his scrawny neck
a trouper to the end monkeybone waves at the crowd even as stu drags him off to an empty table in the farthest corner of the room
you have humiliated me in public for the last time
i doubt that
besides i cant help myself
im just a figment of your imagination
then you can learn to act normally
i had to
aw come on
you know you love me
youre a masochistic pain freak
you gotta love me
i am not
and i dont gotta
monkeybone waves and winks at every female who passes by
stu whacks him upside the head
you are too
mooning over julie when we could both be gettin some o this fine local action
its not like shes gonna know
out of town under five minutes and in a coma dont count
the women here arent my type
most of them arent even my species
cocktail waitress kitty a seven foot cat faced feline sex bomb arrives in her skimpy black dress and shows stu a cheshire cat grin
monkeybone reclines odalisque style on the table
refill on that martini
id like something with an umbrella in it and a really smutty name
sex behind the sofa with your parents in the same room watching the brady bunch
nothing for him
hes being repressed
is something wrong stu
you seem so tense
aaah its the same as always
poor mopes just wishin he was me
ive been trying to get through to the head guy the nightmare god whats his name
to see if he could expedite my case
but i wait and i wait and
im starting to think ill never see her again
a softie at heart kitty sits across from stu and takes his hand
i shoulda proposed kitty
that way at least shed know how i feel
that way shed
wait for me
she leans forward sympathetically
from this particular vantage monkeybone has an unobstructed view of kittys cleavage
and so does stu although hes not quite as obvious about staring
she is waiting for you stu
i know she is
guys like you dont come along that often
believe me i know
monkeybone slinks over behind stu up onto his shoulder and whispers into his ear my fellow americans
i have a dream
let us boldly go where no man has gone before
trying to ignore him im sorry kitty what were you saying
i mean it stu
youre one in a million
kitty is holding the cleavage pose for an unnaturally long time
her furry tail begins to swing back and forth playfully in the air
its hypnotic like a windshield wiper
stu stares at it
monkeybone stares at it
and monkeybones tail responds by straightening
bending upward slightly
im not so special
im just kind of stu is suddenly aware of something long red and wet unrolling onto his shoulder
its a tongue
dangling out of monkeybones open mouth
stu lets out a yowl of shock
blushing bright red he grabs the tongue and shoves it manually back into the monkey mouth whence it came
come on pal
it was a compliment
youda done the same if you had the equipment
stu lunges at monkeybone who jumps over him bounds off the edge of the table and grabs hold of a chandelier
im reportin this to my union
the sidekicks union
me tonto and robin the boy wonder
you top bananas better watch your ass
stu grabs a chair and swings it at the chandelier
monkeybone makes a series of submarine noises and dives directly between kittys breasts into her skimpy black dress
stu circles around kitty following the undulating monkey sized blob thats tunnelling around under her dress
finally monkeybone pops out of the back of the dress and nuzzles kittys ear i left my phone number in your undies
try not to lose it in traffic
ill be right back after i choke my monkey
monkeybone runs under the pool table
stu is giving chase when suddenly a door blows open in the chill night wind
everyone in the bar freezes in place
for there in the doorway is a looming ominous figure the most dreaded figure in all of dark town a grim reaper nine feet tall and swinging a scythe come
to take some hapless coma victim to the land of death
eerie winds whistle and the shroud flutters in the night breeze as the reaper looks from face to face
for a moment he focuses on stu
stu backs away involuntarily with a mounting sense of dread
and monkeybone jumps into his arms clinging to him fearfully
but the reaper moves on past each coma victim in turn finally stopping in front of a tiny wizened prunelike old gent in a wheelchair who looks to be years
old at least
cant hear you young fellow
earl biegler ive come to give you aw hell
gasps of anticipation all around the room as the reaper hands earl a long white envelope
earl opens it slowly and removes
an oversized rectangular ticket
the size of a hershey bar made of solid gold with the letter e stamped upon it
various characters around the barroom react in hushed voices an e ticket
he got a reprieve
good for him
hes gonna wake up
earl throws his crutches aside jumps out of his chair and dances a jig waving the ticket over his head
stu stares at him with naked envy
so long suckers
see you in the funny papers
earl does an end zone dance toward the door
one by one other patrons get up from their seats to watch earls departure
the coma victims shuffle toward a big ride across the midway
its a test your strength machine the kind where you slam down a mallet and try to ring the bell
its surrounded by crocodile moats and storm fences and electrified barbed wire and a big sign reading private earl still jubilant inserts his e ticket into a receptacle at the
a drawbridge lowers and carousel music cranks up and carnival lights blink on and fireworks rocket into the sky
all around them faces turn skyward
clouds are parting
an eddy of swirling colors is forming directly above the e ticket ride and a pinpoint hole opens up at its center
the test your strength machine has been outfitted with a seat where the bell ringer should be
once earl has settled in a giant mechanical man lifts its enormous mallet
and slams it down on the lever end of the machine sending earl rocketing upward toward the hole in the sky
the seat hits the bell but earl keeps going up up up
then with a distinct pop hes gone
over the rainbow
hes practically dead already
how come he goes back and i stay here
maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket
turning abruptly stu marches across the street to the grim reaper whos climbing onto his winged bicycle and seems shocked that anyone would want to chat with him
monkeybone scurries alongside terrified
he got an e ticket
when do i get to wake up
lets not disturb the nice reaper
ive been stuck down here for months
somebody had better start paying attention or im gonna im gonna kick ass
lets not kick the nice reapers ass
monkeybone practically swoons
but the reaper just stares at stu the reaper climbs onto his winged bike and pedals off down the midway
stu lets out a howl of frustration
lets calm down talk things over
how about some comedy relief
brontosaurus walks into a gay bar
stu boots monkeybone aside
theyre at a game stall manned by elsie the cow the one where you throw baseballs at milk bottles
stu picks up a baseball and hurls it at the departing reaper
the ball hits the reaper smack on the head knocking him off his bike
in unison impressed damn
monkeybone cowers in fear as the reaper gets up shaking a fist at them
but stu isnt intimidated
he grabs another ball and winds up
i think weve got this backwards
is disturbing me
the reaper scared shitless jumps back on his bike and pedals off as the ball whizzes past
stu starts chasing after him
the reaper turns down a side street and pedals up an incline one of the fingers of the hand that holds dark town
when the bike hits the end of the finger it takes off into the void and keeps on going
and dont come back unless youve got my e ticket
the reaper vanishes
stu sits dejectedly on the edge of the curb
who am i kidding
im never gonna get out of here
ill never see her again
just then a multi armed messenger boy in royal livery toodles past on a childs scooter
stu looks up
six arms reach into six pockets
finally the messenger finds an envelope and hands it over
inside is an engraved invitation you are invited to a at hypnos hideaway penthouse suite pm sharp if you snooze you lose stus eyes widen with excitement as the messenger
the god of nightmares
do you know what this means monkeybone
hes finally going to hear my case
im going home
as shes done every morning for the last three months julie brushes stus teeth
although she looks a bit more worn and haggard than when we saw her last she always affects a cheerful manner around stu on the off chance that he might
be aware of her presence
she packs the toothbrush away runs a hand along his stubbly cheek
i think we can go another day without shaving
long as you dont look like youre growing one of those stupid little goatees
she opens up the entertainment section of the daily newspaper
hey theres an article about the monkeybone show
theyve run that one episode about eight times now
herb says it gets higher ratings every time
theyre hoping youll give em some new material soon
long bored pause wanna hear another joke
she refolds the paper and reaches into a bedside drawer for a paperback entitled the book of raunch
she pages through it for a moment
let me see
here we go
a plane full of explorers crashlands in new guinea they are captured by a cannibal tribe and taken to the chiefs hut where
wait a minute
i know this one
reading ahead you stinker
you swiped this joke for a monkeybone strip
she whacks him on the arm with the book
no response at all
lets try again
why did the pervert cross the road
the sound of sobbing interrupts her joke
she looks up and sees kimmy standing in the doorway red eyed and crying
whats the matter
this is hard for me julie
but its been three months now and
long pause i gave the order
julie just stares at her for a beat or two refusing to understand
then it sinks in
her hand goes to her mouth in horror and grief
camera tracks up the seemingly endless length of the hypnospire up up through a heavy layer of clouds to the rotating penthouse dome of the building
which is festooned with oodles of inch dss satellite dishes
elevator doors open and we glide into the swank swingin space age bachelor pad of hypnos god of sleep
a giant flying cupid welcomes us tiny bumblebee wings somehow keeping his vast bulk aloft
hyps hideaway occupies the entire penthouse floor and theres always a party in full effect
a rotating disco ball flashes colored light on walls floors and ceilings covered with shockadelic op art patterns
of course a party needs party animals and the darktowners on the scene are in fine fettle working up a sweat on the dance floor
dj sleepy zzzs has three turntables spinning at once
as stu wanders through he gets a big surprise
reproductions of his old nightmare paintings are hanging on the walls
theyve been turned into one sheets for the coming attractions at the morpheum
ycall that art
why my three year old can paint better than that
like youd know
you started out on the back of a napkin you little
scowling at each other the boys turn their backs and part ways
we follow monkeybone to the wet bar where he almost immediately bumps into a statuesque gorgon with a full head of writhing snakes
like the do
so tell me are you a uhh
only fifty dollars to find out
you got it big boy
he grins and shrugs what the hell
as they head for a back room the bartender hands him a snakebite kit
a look of apprehension crosses monkeybones face
but before he can change his mind the gorgons hand yanks him out of frame
stu meanwhile is crossing the dance floor moving among glittering animal people who dance in their bizarre uninhibited way
a five legged woman the bottom half of her body a big human hand smiles at stu as he passes
he tries to talk to her but shes dancing and with five constantly moving legs its difficult to get in close
say have you seen mr
he was here a while ago
arent you stu miley
the nightmare guy
stu grins meekly nods yes
she pulls him over to dance
i heard you were going to be here tonight
this is so cool
jumbo the elephant god is dancing in ungainly fashion nearby
his trunk swings out and hits one of the hand womans arms which snaps off like marble statuary
before she can let out a squeal he does it again
now shes armless a regular venus de milo
you fat slob
watch what youre doing
why dont you slap me
go on slap me
come on stu
lets go where the real fun is
she leads him over to the sunken living room
among the other guests we see a cyclops a yeti a bbq pig
a number of sofas and lounge chairs are arranged around a big crystal orb in the center of the room
the orb is where nightmares happen
although the perspective shifts and the locales change abruptly as in a movie all the nightmares have a d quality as if theyre taking place right here in the room
live feed huh
hyp gets all the best stuff before it goes out to the theatres
stu grins in anticipation
he finds an empty chair and starts to sit down but theres a slug with a mans head already in it
stu picks another seat
the hand woman sidles up alongside him
theres a new one just starting
in long shot we see a handsome young couple dressed in paisley prints
emerging from a sylvan glade they kiss in golden sunlight
then the man breaks free sprints through knee high sunflowers to the middle of the field where a picnic blanket is waiting
his face goes pale as he recognizes the man in the paisley shirt
that thats me
nice shirt dude
paisley shirted stu pours champagne for two
toasts his beloved who is of course julie the dreamer of the dream
he pulls out a little velvet ring box and offers it to her
but when she tries to take it he pulls it away teasing her and steals a kiss
suddenly the two of them are locked in a tight embrace rolling together through the flowers laughing full of joy
the darktowners are rubbing their hands together in anticipation of horrors to come
stu looks from one misshapen face to the next his heart pounding with dread
what is this
whos dreaming this
hey keep it down
julie rolls onto her back on the grass face aglow
only to realize
that stu is no longer there beside her
she looks around
gets to her feet
and the background behind her morphs suddenly into
the room is decorated for a farewell party complete with streamers and confetti
edelstein various medical personnel and friends are wearing party hats lifting champagne glasses in a toast to the guest of honor
the comatose stu
the darktowners clustered around the orb can barely conceal their animal excitement
its obvious that the nightmares theyre watching are more than mere entertainment they get some kind of addictive visceral charge from the spectacle of human terror
he tries to push his way forward to the orb
an angry cyclops elbows him aside
a yeti grabs his coat and pushes him out of the way
what are you doing
comatose stu stands in the center of the room upright and immobile in a party hat
a weird umbilical cord extends from his navel to a huge groaning bellows device like an artificial lung its all that keeps him breathing
edelstein hands a pair of oversized ceremonial scissors to kimmy and she cuts the cord as if opening a new mall
applause all around
julie races toward stu in slo mo shrieking as he deflates into a limp puddle of flesh before her eyes
julies distress is killing him
yet all around him darktowners are cackling their heads off growling howling punching their fists in the air like rowdy drunks at a football game
he loses it altogether
he wont be stopped this time
he makes for the orb climbing over sofas pushing guests aside knocking over their drinks hey
watch it you stinkin gringo somehow julie has heard him
down in the nightmare orb her dream self is looking up trying to locate the source of stus disembodied voice
he struggles to reach the orb but the cyclops is holding him back
stu breaks free and flings himself on the orb which shorts out in a haze of smoke and sparks abruptly ending the nightmare
julies image vanishes and stu gropes at the air despairing
the real julie awakens suddenly and lets out a scream of her own
only now does she realize where she is
shes fallen asleep in the visitors chair next to stus bed
the clock on the wall reads am
stus readouts are spiking like crazy
stu is being dragged across the dance floor by the yeti and jumbo the elephant god
hand woman brings up the rear
who invited this schmuck anyway
oh its my fault
i thought he was cooler than that
its my girlfriend
ive gotta get a message to her
but just then a hush falls over the room and someone screams
a wall panel does a degree turn and a circular bed rotates into the room
languishing atop it garbed in a silk robe which exactly matches the black white checkerboard pattern of the bedspread
is a chubby grinning sleepy eyed satyr with horns and hooves
two wasp women are with him on the bed brushing his furry goat legs and feeding him grapes
as stu fights his way over he sees an odd lump wriggling under the bedcovers
out pops monkeybone clutching a bottle of champagne
i knew i left it in there somewhere
he shakes the bottle pops the cork and sprays spurting bubbly at hypnos the girls and everyone else within firing range
i like a monkey with vision
you said it partner
hilarity all around
stu snatches monkeybone off the bed howd you get in there
its a party
hypnos sir i needed to talk to you wait a minute
stu miley right
boys and girls mr
stu miley in the house
leading a round of applause this is an honor
we see a lot of nightmares down here but yours are like caviar man
you da shits
hypnos i saw a dream
my girlfriend was having it
she dreamed they were pulling the plug on me
she was watching me die
well i have to get a message to her
i have to let her know im okay
until i can get out of here
a vaguely embarrassed look crosses hypnoss face
all the nearby darktowners stare at their shoes clear their throats
which is actually what i wanted to talk to you about
see ive been here three months with a brusque gesture hypnos sends the party girls packing
he slings one arm around stus shoulder and pulls him aside
kid didnt they tell you about this party
tell me what
its a special kind of party
a farewell party
get what im saying
you mean you mean im stu explodes with joy
he practically dances a jig
one by one the celebrants turn their backs and slink discreetly away
i think i
im about to
am i mistaken or dont i get to
is there some
ysee stu as i understand it you made this pact with your sister
no life support
monkeybones jaw drops
he slaps himself across the forehead
no life support
well yeah but that doesnt
it was different then
i was depressed
my life is great now
im in love
monkeybone marches back and forth across the bed wearing a dimwits expression as he mocks stu in a singsongy voice
pull the plug
pull the plug
take my organs
i dont need em
i dont need no
im an idiot
pull the pl stu grabs the monkey and clamps a hand over his mouth
besides julie wouldnt
actually stu julie doesnt get to decide
thats why she was having the nightmare
an embarrassed shrug theyre pulling the plug at nine am
but thats twelve hours
in checking his watch stu removes his hand from monkeybones mouth
the singsong resumes
im so dumb
i deserve to die mr
hypnos you run this place
im begging you
theres gotta be something i can do
stu i like you personally i admire your work but im just the god of sleep
this is deaths bailiwick
maybe you could talk to death
me go crawling to death
my friend it will be a cold cold day in las vegas nevada before i go crawling to that piece of hyp shuts up
looks around the room as if hes afraid of being overheard
then he gestures to the boys to join him on the bed
they climb aboard eagerly
hypnos hits his remote
and they rotate away from the party
privacy at last
now death is not what you would call a people person like me
death is a putz and i should know
im his little brother
youre deaths brother
by the book stick up the ass my way or the highway death
believe me over the course of eternity you get pretty damned tired of that schtick
spreading his hands so i need a job
he sticks me in this broke down amusement park with a buncha animals to run it
im supposed to be grateful
the penthouse is pretty swank though
i decorated it myself
guys i dont mean to be rude but i only have eleven hours and fifty three minutes to
theres one thing you might try
only one guy in history ever pulled it off
well actually two
actually no there was that other guy who
well very few people have done it
hyp ill do anything
and i mean anything
ask the chicks in the back room
youve seen those e tickets right
well what you gotta do
is go into the land of death
and steal an e ticket right out from under deaths nose
land of death
how do i get there
kid listen thats all im saying
and you didnt hear it from me
hyp hits the remote
the bed begins to rotate outward again
youve heard of a fate worse than death
thats whats waiting for you if you screw up
hyp gives the boys a wink and a thumbs up then wanders off to shmooze his other guests
monkeybone shakes stus hand
fate worse than death
well its been real boss but i gotta go buff up my resume
dont put yourself out
ill go to the land of death alone
stu you have my absolute confidence
dead grabbing him by the throat ive got one chance to get back to julie and im gonna take it with or without you
he turns and stalks off
monkeybone stands there blinking
arent you gonna talk me into it
thanks for nothing
stunned monkeybone scurries along behind him pleading
you gotta talk me into it
youll screw up on your own
i mean a guys gotta have a sidekick
for moral support
wisecracks snappy banter wrapping himself around stus leg its the land of death stu the land of death
dont go in there without your comedy relief
you can come
suddenly realizing something went very very wrong here
now we just gotta figure out how to get there
as if in reply a pale spectral presence comes drifting across the dance floor an eight foot tall grim reaper
the boys duck behind a potted plant to watch as he zeroes in on the wet bar where a beautiful coma victim lulu is drunkenly making out with another sloshed
corpse to be fred
lulu doesnt notice
she continues grappling with fred
muttering the reaper dives in and tries to disentangle them
shay youre kinda cute
she ditches fred and throws her arms around the reaper
repulsed he pushes her away props her against the nearest wall and touches her with one bony finger above the heart
its like throwing a switch
her body stiffens
her eyes cross
her tongue droops out of her mouth
she makes a noise like a dial tone
the true horror of death is that it makes you look like a total idiot
the reaper pulls a collapsible hand truck from beneath his shroud and starts maneuvering lulu onto it
how bout one for the road
the reaper ignores him
fred holds up a cocktail glass
hold this for me pally
the reaper heaves a sigh and takes the cocktail glass
fred grabs a pitcher filled with some luminescent tropical concoction
and pours it down the reapers front
wincing at the reaper in his sopping wet pink stained shroud
is that what they call death with dignity
the reaper wrings out his shroud and grabs the hand truck
as he wheels lulu past the boys monkeybone pops up with a helpful hint two words for you my friend club soda
stu claps a hand over mbs mouth as the reaper turns down a hall
the still muttering reaper wheels lulu toward the entrance to dark town
the boys are skulking along behind him at a discreet distance
hes taking her to the land of death right
so all weve gotta do is
hitch a ride
beat stop shaking
ill protect you
why couldnt i be arnold schwarzeneggers figment
the reaper approaches the gates
he presses a remote control beeper and the meshing teeth of the gates slide back far enough to let him pass through
stu realizes theyve only got an instant to make their move
he dives through the gates at top speed
as soon as hes on the other side he hears a nasty clang behind him
monkeybone is caught his body contorted like a pretzel woven in and out among the meshing teeth
stu gives him a good hard yank and he slips out like a strand of fettuccine
they hear rumbling on the tracks outside
a car is arriving
the reaper loads lulu into the little roller coaster and climbs aboard
the car begins to move
stu and monkeybone get there just in time to jump onto the luggage rack in the back
they peep over the back of the car at the reaper and wonder what to do next
monkeybone spies a tool kit mounted under the rack opens it and pulls out a big nasty monkeywrench
the boys nod in agreement
monkeybone clambers over the back of the car and hoists the wrench
stu covers his eyes
stu looks up sees a confused monkeybone alone in the car with lulu
now he clambers into the car as well
whered he go
i dont know
theres no trace of the reaper except for a rumpled shroud a wristwatch and a st
christophers medal on the floor of the car
the boys exchange a puzzled shrug
monkeybone tries on the watch
the wall clock says its not quite am yet julie has managed to round up all her co workers alice hutch clarissa et al
theyre groggy disheveled un made up unshaven
but theyre there
thats when they pull the plug
thats how long weve got to wake him up
beat now these are stus old charts from five years ago when he first came to the sleep lab
she points to a series of easels where hutch and alice have been tacking up eeg printouts engram maps etc
they show incredibly intense nightmare activity
the chart below is his new chart
the lower chart shows a jagged spike virtually identical to the one on the upper chart
julie pauses for effect then pulls on the edge of the lower chart opening it up like a gatefold the onlookers gasp
opened accordion style the lower chart shows the same spike recurring again and again ten times over
hes stuck in a loop a nightmare loop
beat anybody here know what oneirix is
sure its an enzyme
the brain secretes it during violent dream activity
its nightmare juice
julie and i were on the team that learned to synthesize it
if those charts are right stus swimming in the stuff
puzzled are you thinking we can decrease the levels
i want to give him more
i want to give him a massive dose
thats not going to stop his nightmare i dont want to stop the nightmare hutch
i want to crank it up
i want to take it right off the charts
i want to scare him awake
the group exchanges nervous glances its risky
julie claps her hands all right
we have a plan
as the group swings into action hutch pulls julie aside
you know julie even if this works which it probably wont that stuff is tricky
you dont know what itll do to his brain
whatll it do if they pull the plug
a panoramic view of an impossibly grand gilded age train station
a central turntable is the hub for dozens of tunnels which converge like the spokes of a wheel disgorging long trains full of dead passengers from all over the world
far above in the dizzying reaches of the vaulted dome that crowns the station reapers on flying bicycles spiral about like mosquitos bringing dead souls to their final reward
this is thanatopolis land of death truly the end of the line
a wet squeegee scrapes across the frame wielded by a grim reaper in a jumpsuit bearing the logo of land of death window washers inc
the noise is irritating so a reaper on the inside snaps the venetian blinds shut cutting off our view
camera pulls back and we realize weve been seeing all this through the wall to wall windows of
it looks like the observation bridge in the nose of the nautilus the decor is ornate and the office equipment vacuum tubes pipe intercoms etc
is on loan from the jules verne museum of defunct technology
reapers are bustling about everywhere
one of them pushing a hand truck laden with oversized crates bearing the label dead souls
batch of souls just back from processing
put them over there with the others
he unloads the crates in a corner of the room where scores of crated souls are already piled up
we have a new shipment death o
yeah yeah yeah
ill get to it
we cant see death himself just the back of a tall swivel chair
with much creaking it rotates around bringing us face to face with
hes not at all what youd expect
hes a chubby cheeked bespectacled accountant type
a harried bureaucrat just trying to do his job
theres something sweet almost avuncular about him
theres an open crate of dead souls on his desk
dead souls take the form of perforated paper dolls
two dimensional underwear clad usually wearing expressions of shock
death pulls a sheet from the box detaches the dead soul and outfits it with a cut out toga
now he places it in a big diorama with oodles of toga clad souls staring up at a scale model of an active volcano
he throws a switch and beams as the volcano spits blobs of ketchup into the air
last days of pompeii
now there was a great moment in death
if i may point out
death grumbling digs into the box and pulls out another soul
his eyes light up
he clutches the sheet with trembling hands
i cant believe oh man i sinatra
do you know how long ive been waiting for this
sure enough the doll on the sheet is ol blue eyes
death digs in a desk drawer and pulls out a shoebox diorama
dino and sammy standing at microphones with a third center mike conspicuously open
make that your bleakness
the dispatch team is waiting
grumpy death shoves frank dean and sammy back in the drawer
okay okay send em in
a flunky opens the office door and a long line of reapers glides in
death lugs an enormous musty leather bound book over to a long table
he snaps his fingers and whistles
his pet hellhound a tiny plump weiner dog with a horned deaths head for a face comes skittering across the office floor and jumps into his lap
meanwhile the assistant turns on a chugging card shuffling univac computer which spits out a length of tickertape
chakasandra singh new delhi
death checks the name against the master list in his big ledger
he pulls out a document and puts his stamp on it the death warrant
this he gives to the reaper at the head of the line
mulrooney lavinia p
head crushed in a pants press
as the line moves along we notice an odd looking reaper nearing the desk
his gait is wobbly
his head bobs independently of the rest of his body
theres a big luminescent stain on the front of his shroud
everyone freezes as death points a bony finger directly at the wobbly reaper with the iridescent stain
youre the customer okay
youre about to die
its a big occasion
a formal occasion
and as you shuffle off this mortal coil the last thing your eyes behold is a grim reaper covered with
sputtering what the hell is that
two voices come out from under the shroud at once cranberry margarita
sex on the beach
much coughing and throat clearing from under the shroud
by now deaths lapdog is growling at the stained reaper and death cant hear what anyone is saying
he shushes the dog
the little hellhound yips viciously
death whacks him on the rump
well whatever it is you get that shroud to the dry cleaner asap
now where were we
devereaux san francisco
complications resulting from coma
says here hes supposed to recover
a loud chorus of a wwwwws from the disappointed reapers
death stamps the word reprieve on clarkes warrant
his assistant crosses the room
in the far wall is a steel reinforced vault door with a hydraulic wheel the kind you see at banks
the assistant dials in a combination turns the wheel laboriously pulls the door open and steps inside
returning a moment later with a priceless gold e ticket
the upper half of the stained reaper begins to gyrate wildly
monkeybone is doing an agitated tap dance on his head
his tail whips repeatedly across stus face
the reaper in front of the boys stares at the e ticket crestfallen
take this to dark town
sad to say hes gonna live another forty years
a consoling pat on the shoulder sorry
nobody said this job would be easy
the assistant hands the reaper a yellow mailmans pouch containing the e ticket
but before he can depart the stained reaper aka stu and monkeybone jumps to the front of the line
say death just out of curiosity could we maybe swap jobs with that other guy
see weve been meaning to drop in on dark town i mean ive been meaning to
death is stunned by this unprecedented breach of protocol
the other reapers in the line are abuzz
i beg your pardon
i got relatives there
an enraged stu is yanking on monkeybones tail signalling him to shut up
monkeybone in pain squeals repeatedly
finally he reaches down and the blow sends stu staggering
death and the other reapers look on in astonishment as the stained reaper does a bizarre dance across the floor top half and bottom half moving independently
miraculously he manages to right himself and regain his balance
now what were you saying
in unison nothing
id like to have a word with you in private
he stands and gestures toward a side room
the boys follow
the little hellhound scampers out from behind the desk
and grabs the hem of their shroud in its teeth
the boys keep on walking but the shroud stays behind
somehow they go three or four steps before they realize theyve been exposed
death jumps a foot in the air and shrieks
the boys back toward the big window overlooking the trainyard
the reapers close in on them brandishing their scythes
that little twerp
hes the one who put you up to this
with a screech monkeybone leaps into the air bounds over the heads and shoulders of the advancing reapers and snatches the yellow e ticket pouch from the guy death gave
he bounds over a table and into stus arms with the precious pouch in hand
death lets out a great rattling bellow of rage
his features begin to jitter violently
his head explodes
nothing to lose at this point
with a crash the boys dive through the big window overlooking the trainyard
the headless death gropes around blindly waving to his assistant
the assistant opens a cabinet containing a half dozen identical heads
he pulls out a spare and screws it onto deaths neck
the boys land hard at the edge of the trainyard
behind them reapers are shepherding a line of newly arrived dead people past a sign which reads processing this way
by the time they can dust themselves off an alarm starts blaring
reapers drop what theyre doing point at the boys
nearby a flying bicycle is propped up against a sign
side by side they race toward the bike each of them clutching the strap of the pouch yanking each other back and forth in a tug of war
he pulls the pouch onto his shoulder and monkeybone with it
they grab the bike climb aboard and pedal off revealing the sign it was leaning against cycle repair
stu pedals onto the central turntable area
the batwings on the rear of the bike flap feebly but the flying bike just wont fly
monkeybone looks over his shoulder
a small army of reapers anned with scythes is pouring into the trainyard behind them
theres a thing here
theres a switch
monkeybone fiddles with the ignition switch
a black cloud of exhaust belches violently from the rear of the bike almost pitching them off their seat
the batwings start to flap faster
the engine backfires and dies
stu fiddles with the switch but its no go
isnt that lulu
lulu is still sitting in her little car at the edge of the tracks eyes crossed mouth agape
monkeybone waves brightly
then a mob of reapers appears on either side of lulus car swarming out onto the tracks
stu starts pedaling for his life
he makes for the train tunnels in the far wall of the station
illuminated signs over the tunnels read calcutta
waco tx and directly ahead
by now theyre well out onto the turnaround
stu pedals frantically bouncing over tracks and ties
monkeybone bites his fingernails down to the quick as he watches the column of reapers pursuing them onto the tracks
watching through a crooked spyglass as the boys pedal down the tracks
now weve got em
petting his hellhound he reaches for a wall switch
the boys are almost at the dark town tunnel
the reapers on foot will never be able to catch them
but as they pick up speed for the stretch run the ground begins to move beneath them
death has activated the train turnaround the rotating platform at the end of the line which allows an engine to reverse direction
before they know it theyre doing a full
the boys continue to bounce down the tracks but the tunnel entrances seem to be spinning before their eyes
before they know it theyre pedaling directly toward the mob of angry reapers
werent we just here
stu jerks the handlebars hard right and jumps the track hes on
he winces in pain as the bike bounces over a series of rails
whatd i tell you
you go to the land of death wear a jockstrap
the reapers are spreading out around the turntable encircling it
stu rides around the periphery of the great turning platter but theres no getting off
theyre completely surrounded
monkeybone covers both eyes and wails in fear
but stu is rattling the ignition switch making one last effort to get the bike aloft
the engine catches
trailing black fumes the bicycle rises
the reapers converge in its path and raise their scythes
but the bike just manages to clear the tangle of scythes leaving the reapers slicing at empty air
through the big window he sees the boys leveling off flying toward the dark town tunnel
theyre moments away from a clean escape
stus readout monitors are registering frantic nightmare activity when julie and alice enter
julie sets her purse on stus bedside table removes a syringe and a test tube filled with purplish fluid
whats the maximum safe dose
most weve ever used is half a cc
he unlocks a red security box on his wall
inside is a toggle switch labelled fate worse than death
he flips it
the plunger goes down injecting fluid into stu
monkeybone is sitting on stus shoulder facing backward thumbing his nose at the reapers
stu glances back as well laughing unable to believe his own good luck
since theyre both looking the wrong way neither of them sees the sheer monolithic wall rising up directly in their path
its no ordinary wall
its stus painting the one alice found in the closet the wolf surgeon canvas from his scary period and as the bicycle slams into it it begins to topple over
pinning stu against the ground underneath
just stu who finds himself on an operating table with the world of the painting coming to d life around him
the wolf faced surgeons are closing in on him baring their fangs brandishing their scalpels and their metallic replacement parts
suddenly the fabric of this weird reality tears just like a rip in a canvas
a furry paw reaches through grabs stu by the hand
this aint my nightmare
monkeybone pulls stu through the rip in the back of the giant toppled canvas
the bikes there waiting
they hop aboard and pedal off into the dark town tunnel a split second before the reapers arrive to slice them to ribbons
stu pedals so hard his heart is about to burst
he feels down at his side the yellow pouch containing the e ticket is still there
the reapers are clustered at the mouth of the tunnel but they arent following
the boys weep with glee
its a miracle theyve cheated death
an exhausted stu huffs and puffs as he pedals the bike up the last stretch of track to the platform outside the gates
he climbs off the bike and stares back it looks like the last thousand miles or so have all been uphill
he slings the yellow pouch over his shoulder
you saved my life monkeybone
i never wouldve made it without you
we got exactly five minutes left
now that im leaving i feel like theres lots of things i havent said
whos gonna look out for you
are you gonna be okay when im gone
oh dont you worry
ill be fine
youve been a hell of a figment pal
i sure wish i could take you home with me
the gates slide open
stu passes through
but monkeybone lingers behind a moment just long enough for one of the singing sphinxes to slip him a big nasty baseball bat
worried about my feelings are you
well theres a new twist
dont joke around little buddy
i mean it
i really do love y he turns and monkeybone mark mcgwires him upside the head
stu crumples in a heap
love you too
laughing maniacally monkeybone steals the e ticket and goes racing off stus head is swimming
it takes him a few seconds but he gets to his feet
by now monkeybone is halfway to the e ticket ride
worse yet stus watch reads am
the streets are lined with darktowners rooting monkeybone on as if hes the hometown favorite in a big footrace
which he is
monkeybone reaches the e ticket ride drops his e ticket into the receptacle at the gate
the drawbridge lowers
as stu sprints down the street the snail man oozes into his path and trips him
before he can get up cackling darktowners converge on him forcing him back to the ground and holding him there
its all part of the deal
weve got big plans for that body of yours
the familiar miasma of colors is beginning to swirl in the night sky overhead
monkeybone straps on a needle tipped helmet which makes him look like a simian dart
then he climbs into the seat of the test your strength machine and braces himself for the big ride
onlookers applaud as the robot lifts its mallet and lets fly
the tiny figure of monkeybone soars toward the swirling colors
his dart helmet strikes the black hole dead center
stu watches helplessly as monkeybone penetrates the veil of the sky and vanishes
hes still screaming when the cackling darktowners drag him out of the plaza by the heels
rocketing upward through the clouds in his dart helmet a look of sheer exhilaration on his simian face
somewhere a clock begins to chime the hour
most of our cast is either in stus room or in the hallway outside
plus weve got a man of the cloth two legal types with briefcases and several of the nurses from the facility
alice squeezes julies hand and julie squeezes stus
the minute hand on the clock hits twelve
kimmy sobbing into a handkerchief gives dr
edelstein the nod
as he reaches for the power switch
julie drops the hand with a gasp
the doctor jumps half a foot
all at once stu is sitting bolt upright in bed
shaking his head and feeling around gingerly under the bedclothes as if something very sharp has just poked him in the ass
kimmy sighs and faints dead away
stu blinks and looks about the room disoriented
it could be because hes just come out of a coma after seven months
or it could be because hes a monkey unaccustomed to hanging out in a human body
hey you are a looker
a burst of laughter from the others in the room
weeping tears of joy julie flings herself across the bed and hugs him tight
while julie is hugging him stu is checking out his new fingers and toes rubbing his sparse patch of chest fur
doctors and nurses look on in amazement from the doorway
its a miracle
its a miracle
two more ticks of the clock
stu is almost oblivious to julie
he lifts up the sheet sneaks a quick peek at his crotch and grins delightedly
julie gives him another kiss whispers in his ear thank you
thank you for coming back to me
what she doesnt know is that although he still looks like stu his body is now occupied by monkeybone
since hes now a hybrid character man on the outside and monkey within lets call him
boy i dont know about you guys but im starving
a damp stonewalled vault with a barred door
stu is sprawled on the floor out cold when a voice awakes him
rat guard o
stu comes around just in time to see a panel sliding open in the ceiling far overhead
a torrent of junk stale popcorn half eaten candy bars molten ice cream pops and sticky soda rains down on his face
a horde of dark figures emerge from the shadowy catacombs around him
all at once hands are grabbing at him from all directions
stu lets out a scream backs up against a wall who are y what do you want
a mongol warrior with a droopy mustache looks up at him
after a moment stu realizes that the dark figures have almost no interest in him instead theyve been grabbing at the half eaten snacks that cascaded down onto his head
a long haired slav rasputin dives on a hershey bar with only one bite out of it but an oddly familiar fat man gets there first
stu gapes at him
a fat bastard but damn quick on his feet
thats how he keeps his girlish figure
gotta move fast in this crowd or youll starve
here you go pal
have some popcorn
he offers stu a box of popcorn soaked in dr
what is this stuff
they feed us the slops from the morpheum theatre
you hope for jujubes settle for goobers
what are you doing in here
various others emerge from the shadows to shake stus hand
im jack the ripper
atilla the hun
trade you a twizzler for a box of raisinets
what in hell is this place
as if in reply a fanfare sounds in the distance
a rat guard stands at attention by the door tooting his kazoo to announce the arrival of an honored guest
all hail the most glorious
most esteemed all powerful god of sleep
his royal lassitude enough enough im hung over
as hypnos passes the dungeon dwellers race up to the wall of bars that separates the entry area from the dungeon proper
did you bring me the cough medicine
did you remember the night light i asked for
king you pussy
bite me poe
i hate waking up in the dark
sorry steve maybe next time
and hows our new guest settling in
stu lunges at hypnos who backs up just out of reach
i was coming to congratulate you
it aint easy snatching one of those e tickets
steve here was the last guy to pull it off and that musta been what years ago
whyd you do it
whatd i ever do to you
its simple stu
we need nightmares lots of em
so whenever we can swing it we send a guy up to stimulate the flow
a nightmare maker
like steve here
weve been doing this all the way back to atilla and genghis khan
but why me
whyd you pick on me
the monkey of course
it was his idea
nobody wants to be a sidekick stu
so one day he comes to us hes got a proposition
we help him get your body
in return he gives us all the nightmares we want
im a comic strip artist
whats he gonna do draw really scary cartoons
oh no no no
ysee stu as it happens that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams
and she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice
stus face goes white as he realizes the point of the master plan
oh were predicting a record box office
its like i always say
nightmares are your best entertainment
hypnos marches off chuckling
stus head sinks into his hands
stus back from the hospital
julie is removing his bags from the trunk of kimmys car while stu and kimmy chat in the front seat
i just couldnt stand the thought of you suffering
i love you so i would never have
forgive me stu
please forgive me
weve still got a pact
if anything ever happens to you ill be right there to return the favor
baring his teeth so drive carefully
from now on
he climbs out
kimmy is so rattled that she smacks bumpers with the car parked in front of her
she peels out with the hand brake still on
stu bone and julie enter with luggage
he stands there for a moment scoping out the unfamiliar surroundings
she sets the bags down taps him on the shoulder
stu bone grins insipidly
she kisses him pulls him into a tight embrace and then overwhelmed by emotion begins to sob
oh baby i cant believe youre back
home sweet home huh
actually i was expecting something a little swankier
how much loot does old stu rake in anyway
she gives him an extremely puzzled look
meaning me of course
im referring to myself
you have to assume monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise
why dont you just
rest on the sofa for a minute
ill be right back
she goes into the kitchen as stu bone plops onto the sofa
he spies a bowl of fresh fruit on the coffee table and immediately tries to pick up a banana with his foot
but he cant
hes got shoes on
frowning he unties his shoe peels off his sock
his bare foot is in the fruit bowl when julie returns from the kitchen with a tray holding a chocolate cake and the bottle of champagne stu bought three months
the cake bears the message welcome home i love you in pink icing
she sits beside him with the goodies
he removes his foot from the bowl crosses his legs wiggles his toes at her
she smiles uncertainly
then she opens the bottle of champagne and pours two flutes full
heres to a bottle
we should have opened
three months ago
she finishes pouring hands a flute to stu bone
his face is smeared with cake and icing
hes scooped out a big fistful and crammed it right into his pie hole
he grins at her
bitchin good cake
stu are you
youre acting kind of
grabbing another fistful in what way
then we hear tiny nails skittering across the hardwood floors at high speed
and buster the dog races into the living room
look whos here
stu bone tenses instinctively
the dog is yipping wagging his tail insanely at the sight of his long lost master until he gets just a little bit closer and senses that something is very
buster sizes stu bone up and growls
stu bone bares his teeth and hisses
the dog lunges and stu bone jumps up on the sofa
oh shit the cake
he bends down snatches up the cake and cradles it under one arm as he kicks at buster from the sofa
the frazzled julie pours herself another jolt of champagne a stiff one
sounds of julie taking a shower in the adjacent bathroom o
stu bone is sprawled in bed pillows propped up behind him flipping channels on the bedroom tv with his trusty remote
the discovery channel happens to be showing a jane goodall special
narrator on tv the mating rituals of the african silverback are as rigidly formalized as those of any animal we know with the possible exception of man
onscreen a female gorilla is presenting her furry haunches to an alpha stu bone watches this erotic spectacle with a connoisseurs eye
he glances over at the open bathroom door and catches a teasing glimpse of julies shadow as she steps out of the shower and pulls on a robe
he scratches and sniffs just to put himself in the mood
on tv monkey foreplay which consists of a pounce from behind
narrator on tv in the wild a dominant chimpanzee male is likely to engage in sex numerous times throughout the day with a shockingly wide variety of stu bone mutes
the nature special and sneaks up behind julie just as she emerges from the bathroom in her robe and towel turban
what are you watching
she tries to pass but he grabs the belt of her robe and spins her around
he delicately unwraps the turban then opens her robe and pulls it closed around the two of them
you sure this is
got a doctor on duty
as long as its okay with monkeybone stu bone almost lets out a gasp of shock
what does she mean
glancing downward which it seems to be
stu bone does a take
the good news is she doesnt suspect
the bad news is hes apparently named after his creators penis
all at once the air is full of barry whites lush baritone on the bedroom cd player
through the bedroom doorway we see stu bone and julie waltzing romantically belly to belly still wrapped up in the single robe
the only jarring note is busters frantic barking
the poor dog is stuck behind an accordion gate in the hall going crazy trying to warn his mistress about the imposter in stus body
the dog is almost drowning out barry white so stu bone stops kissing julie long enough to reach over with one foot and kick the door shut
julie watches from the bed as stu bone begins peeling off his pjs going into a bizarrely formalized monkey mating dance
he circles back and forth from one side of the bed to the other making faces grunting feinting at her occasionally
julie has some dim sense that this ritual is supposed to be erotic but in fact its making her damned nervous
she finds herself scrunching up on the bed trying to keep out of stu bones way
now he leaps up onto the foot of the bed
and with an animal howl of triumph pounces at julie
terrified she rolls out of the way
stu bones skull slams into the headboard
are you dazed he sits up
he tries to stand but his rubbery legs give way and he pitches over cracking his skull again on the nightstand
julie helps a punchdrunk staggering stu to the stairway
how was it
i dont recall
it was great baby
lets get you to the er
as they pass buster lets out a little growl of satisfaction from behind his gate
hold on the dogs satisfied expression as stu bone loses his balance and topples down the stairs o
rasputin atilla jack the ripper and stephen king are engrossed in their weekly parcheesi game
stu is clinging to the bars bemoaning his fate
im not like the rest of you
im just a regular guy
im not a nightmare maker
neither are we
we got our bodies hijacked just like you
the guys who replaced us are the nightmare makers
i was a mess sergeant in the mongol horde
i never wanted to be the scourge of asia
i just wanted a new recipe for yak
i was jack the haberdasher
did you all have sidekicks
hey i got screwed over by my own dog
go through hell to get that e ticket and who winds up in my body
that darn cujo
typhoid mary runs past giggling pursued by a huffing hitchcock
hes sure got a thing for those icy blondes
the rat guard appears to announce miley
you got a visitor
at the sight of stu behind bars she breaks down crying
im so sorry stu
i wanted to tell you what was going on
i really really liked you
my situation is really not important
the thing is my girlfriend is now living with and possibly engaged to a demented monkey
youre such a beautiful man
look at you stuck in this place and only thinking of her
listen to me
is there any way i can warn her what monkeybone is up to
break it up you two
the rat guard pushes stu back with a prod
kitty reaches out
give me a moment
just to look at him
oh my sweet sweet stu
as she gazes at him love struck the overhead panel opens and a deluge of crud from the morpheum lands directly on stu
kitty bawls inconsolably as the rat guard leads her away
stu bone in pajamas and a head bandage reading the morning funnies
he pounds the table practically weeping with hilarity at the monkeybone priceless
this stuff just kills me
im heading in to work baby
are you sure youll be okay
theres just one thing i dont get
monkeybone creator awakens from coma thats a big story
thats front page news
but i cant find a word of coverage in this stinkin rag
shuffling through the paper hey
dont i have a tv show
they only made the one episode
theyve shown it about nineteen times
i need a new pr guy
julie grins plants a goodbye smooch on his forehead and exits
he waits a minute then reaches for the phone
the house is crawling with press
there must be three dozen reporters and photographers and tv crews hanging on stubones every pronouncement
yes being in a coma taught stu miley a thing or two about life
buckle your seat belts for one
but seriously stu miley is a different man today
im much homier
the front door opens
a stunned julie pushes her way inside
and speaking of which heres the light of my life the pert and saucy miss julie mcelroy
i had to park two blocks away
is something he pulls her to his side for a photo op
flashbulbs go off
i took the liberty of calling a little press conference
were on tv so dont say shit
covering his mouth shit
i said it
i said it again
stu what is it about monkeybone that makes him so popular
well its partly that he punctures all the phony pretensions of our modern society
and its partly that hes a breathtakin heartbreakin rump shakin sex machine
beat ask these gentlemen here
theyre an important cog in my media machine
theyll be doing six new episodes of the monkeybone show under my personal supervision
he pauses for a photo op with mike cachuela and mike mitchell
its all synergy
the show synergizes the strip which synergizes the merchandising which synergizes the religion which synergizes the barbara walters special and then baby we are all in the united empire of
julie squeezes through the crowd finds herb working the phone
i tell you hes ready to merchandise
weve gotta move quickly
get the toy guys the burger guys the lunchbox guys herb
what in gods name herb holds up a finger
hes too busy talking
stu bone enters with the video crew in tow
julie somehow manages to sideline him
whats this about merchandising
you always hated merchandising
well baby i do but to look at it from another angle
theres a potload of money here
supercharged pop music underneath as stu bone comes running around a corner followed a moment later by a screaming horde of beautiful groupies in black miniskirts and high heels
its like something out of a hard days night only more so
tight on stu bone head still bandaged eyes closed snoring slightly
he wears a big monkey grin as he dreams the above
a carload of supermodels
they kill their engine in the middle of a busy intersection and climb out to join the mob chasing stu bone
he cuts around a corner ducks into an alley and flattens himself behind a dumpster
as the girls run past he pulls out a handkerchief and mops sweat from his brow
then with a what the hell twinkle he steps out and flings his sweaty hankie into the midst of the groupies
a catfight ensues as they scramble after this precious memento
the chase resumes
suddenly he realizes hes slowing down
running in slo mo
same deal with the girls on his trail
after a moment he freezes
he cant move anything except his eyes he looks right left up down
and suddenly he sees hypnos winking into view directly in front of him
hypnos is perfectly capable of moving
he strolls right up to the frozen stu bone and slaps him repeatedly moe howard style
you two bit simian stooge
what the hell is this
we didnt send you up here to shake your booty and chase broads
we sent you up to make nightmares
stu bone tries to speak
all that comes out is a slo mo drawl
now find that nightmare juice and get to work
cause you may be a free man during the day
but when you dream your monkey ass is mine
he winds up throws a roundhouse punch at stu bones face
stu bone sits up suddenly in bed
for a moment hes relieved it was all a dream
then he realizes his face is swelling like a prizefighters
his front tooth is loose
blood is streaming from his nose
hes awake fully dressed and fishing around in the pocket of julies topcoat
he finds her key ring and tiptoes furtively to the front door
ill show him
he unlocks the door and enters the darkened lab
finds the dispensary area and kneels beside a locked refrigerator
then he shuffles through the keys on the ring until he finds one labelled fridge
on the top shelf is a corked beaker of purple fluid bearing the label oneirix with red danger stickers all over it
stu bone takes it out flashes a sinister grin and empties its contents into a similar beaker
then he refills the original from a hip flask and replaces it
hes just about to leave when hes startled by a series of simian grunts and squeaks which are translated in subtitle hey handsome
he turns and spots a seductive female baboon whos confmed to a cage in the corner
the conversation continues in monkey talk
come here good looking
beat why dont you let me out of this cage
hey id love to baby but
itd put me in hot water
caressing his chin i know how to be very very grateful
he pulls out a matchbook and scribbles a number on it
tell you what angel
when you get out give me a call
a light goes on suddenly in the outside hallway
stu bone tries to dive for cover but the female baboon grabs him by the belt and pulls him against the cage
startled he drops the oneirix beaker which rolls out into the hall
the beaker clatters loudly as it rolls through the lab door
stu bones hands grope through the doorway but the female baboon has got him by the pants leg and wont let go no matter how much he rattles the cage
he cant quite pull himself through the door
he unbuckles the belt
unzips his pants
keeps clawing toward the beaker
but he still cant quite make it and the baboon wont let go
now his pants are down around his knees
he keeps wriggling until his pants legs are entirely inside out and still he cant quite reach the beaker
his shoes are caught in his pants cuffs
minus his pants he grabs the beaker
in fg through all this is a dim teenage janitor pushing his electric floor polisher
he has his walkman on and he cant hear any of the mayhem behind him
he sings along atonally with the music gettin jiggy wit it gettin jiggy wit it
a disheveled stu bone back from his secret mission is trying to take his clothes off so he wont wake julie
but she starts to rouse so he jumps into bed fully dressed and pulls up the covers
is that you
where did you go
i was asleep
baby dont lie
i know you went out
you mustve been dreaming
she pulls the covers back
hes still wearing his topcoat shoes socks and shorts
but no pants
youre wearing a topcoat stu
where are your pants
well miss smarty if i didnt go out i wouldnt need any pants
now would i
he pulls the covers up to his chin
the two of them lie there in the dark staring up at the ceiling
the entire monkeybone brain trust has come to visit herb syndicate head mr
bowers and several corporate reps hoping to arrange tie in deals
host stu bone has started to take on a simian look more prominent ears flared nostrils heavy beard stubble etc
the burger god rep sets a tray of fast food in front of stu bone the packaging all covered with angelic haloed monkeybones
as you know burger god has outlets nationwide
were prepared to back a major tv buy to launch our mega monkey meal
beat go ahead
try a bite
stu bone takes a bite out of his monkeyburger looks pleased at first then begins picking something out of his teeth
whats the matter
i think its a pig hair
examining a contract how much is mcdonalds offering
stu bone immediately signs the contract and shakes hands with the burger god rep
herb consults his agenda
oh heres something
the city zoo is kicking off a fund raising campaign
they wonder if youd be willing to appear at a benefit
its a benefit
but we could probably get people and entertainment tonight to cover it
i get it
we could give the public the impression that we were doing something
you remember bill here from the bazoom toy company
hes got a little something i think youll like
the toy rep sets a lockbox on the table
a stencil on the box reads top secret
he pulls out a key and opens it to reveal
a tuxedoed collectors edition monkeybone doll lying on a bed of crushed purple velvet
he carefully removes the treasure from its chest
its right hand is hinged
the dolls thumb is up its rear
its a prototype
code name little jack horner
go on pull out his thumb
stu bone stares at the doll cautiously yanks its thumb out
we go to slo mo as the rising arm causes a noxious aerosol spray to shoot out of monkeybones ass
and we stay in slo mo as stu bone stares at the doll in wonderment and awe
a man in looooove
still in slo mo the execs crack up gag hold their noses at the awful stank of it
stu bone is the only one not laughing
he reaches out to touch the doll to fondle it adoringly and suddenly were back to real time
you know kids they love anything gross
this is a work of genius
this is art
this is the answer to all my prayers
beat say just a technical question could you fill these babies up with a particulate solution of one part chemical enzyme to ten parts water
well i guess
he breaks into riotous laughter and begins blasting monkeyfarts at herb and the execs who dive for cover under the conference table
laughter and back slapping as stu bone walks his guests to their cars
so heres my idea
we do a giveaway at the zoo benefit
we get a big pinata
we fill it with monkeybone dolls hundreds of em
thats a great idea
you guys dont know it but you just saved my ass
with a big grin he pantomimes sticking a thumb up his ass in obvious imitation of the doll and then gives the thumbs up sign
the unnerved execs gape at him as he goes back inside hes developed an odd loping gait and his arms swing outward in wide arcs as he walks
he digs around under the sink finds the purple beaker of oneirix
looks at the farting doll
thisll get him off my back
a promo for the monkeybone cartoon show
monkeybone swings across the screen on a vine followed by a string of grinning live action fans doing a scratch n sniff pull out a plum line dance
its his world we just live in it
back with six all new episodes starting a distraught julie mutes the tv
her friend alice is on the sofa beside her having coffee and dessert
the thing is im responsible for the way hes acting
its the nightmare juice
its got to be
julie that stuff probably saved his life
i cant explain this alice but im not so sure it did
its as if
hes not stu any more
the stu i love is gone
beat he spends all his time in the garage
he says hes
tight on the flask of oneirix as stu bone picks it up
hes wearing a gas mask
hes rigged a clothesline in the garage
monkeybone dolls are clipped to it ass end up forming a makeshift assembly line
he dips a turkey baster into the flask
withdraws a quantity of purple fluid
plucks the finger out of the first dolls behind
and plunges the turkey baster into the dolls hindquarters filling it with oneirix
the dolls buttocks take on the purple hue characteristic of orangutans in heat
stu bone holds the doll at arms length and pulls its finger launching a purple puff of spiked nightmare gas
nightmare in a butt
looking around okay
guinea pig guinea pig
stu bone steps out into the driveway and hears a low growl buster is giving him the stinkeye from behind the picket fence
stu bones eyes light up with inspiration
cmere ole buddy
loud barking outside
julie wanders over toward the window
lets bring him in for some tests
i guarantee youre overreacting
julie lifts the curtain and sees stu bone in his gas mask bent over in a weird crab like stance chasing buster around the yard with the monkeybone doll
julie doesnt seem especially surprised but alices mouth falls open
actually no i dont think im overreacting
buster is apparently alone now hes pacing in circles under a high tree branch staring up and growling
someone throws a pine cone at the picket fence
busters head turns just for an instant and stu bone plunges out of the tree directly on top of the dog
the two of them grapple rolling around on the grass
for a moment it looks like this battle royale could go either way
then stu bone gets on top of buster straddles him shoves the ass of the monkeybone doll up against his muzzle
a purple cloud of nightmare gas hits buster in the face
the dog goes limp
his eyes roll back in his head
he starts to twitch
sweet dreams you little bastard
disheveled but triumphant stu bone stands up pounds his chest with both fists and lets out a tarzanian roar
lights go on all over the neighborhood
angry neighbors poke their heads out the windows
stu bone skulks back into the garage
he throws back a tarp revealing hundreds of boxed monkeybone dolls stacked so high they fill an entire wall of the garage
he pulls out his turkey baster cranks up the clothesline and goes to work
camera tracks in on the twitching face of buster and we see a german expressionist nightmare all low angles and heavy shadows
were in some kind of operating room where a struggling patient is being wheeled in on a tall creaking gurney
four orderlies in surgical masks are holding him down
the patient is buster
and the orderlies
a cat surgeon draws the sheet back
looks at the spreadeagled buster
and brandishes a big nasty pair of garden shears
the dark town audience is scratching its collective head at busters dream which is showing in one of hyps nightmare orbs
an angry hypnos slams down the phone and storms across the dance floor to his big circular bed
that stinkin monkey
i cant believe it
we give him a body and he sends us dogs
a feline beauty embraces him from behind pulls him onto the bed
lets not think about dogs
lets think about pussycats
she draws one sharp claw lightly down his chest
he gives her a now youre talkin grin and hits a switch causing the big circular bed to rotate off the dance floor and into the boudoir
as it turns we see kittys paw closing discreetly around a key chain on the nightstand
stus curled up on the dank floor when hes awakened by the sound of a visitor in the corridor outside kitty
she passes a sack containing food and bottled water through the bars and shushes the astonished stu before he can speak
youll need it when youre traveling
glancing back at the guards she pulls a key from her cleavage
dont ask where i got it
you cant do this
youll get in trouble
youre the only true hearted man i ever met
you find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy
how am i gonna get past the guards
ill worry about the guards
loudly she turns down the corridor
stu stands there for a beat gaping at the key in his hand
then he hears the sound of carnage outside
a ferocious bloody battle seems to be underway
realizing that kitty must be in trouble he uses the key to unlock the dungeon door
he finds kitty hunched in the corner on all fours surrounded by blood and tufts of fur and an abandoned guards hat
thanks kitty ill never forget you for th she looks up at him feline eyes aglow
theres a three foot long rodents tail dangling out of her mouth
he races off as kitty resumes her feast
the sound of fighting has roused the other dungeon dwellers and when they realize the dungeon door is open they come rushing out en masse
then the panel opens
they hear food raining down behind them
hitchcock is the first to turn back then stephen king then atilla
a moment later theyre back to their old habits climbing over one another to get at a half empty box of raisinets
the usual gang sitting around at their computer terminals etc
julie is coolly reading notebook entries into a tape recorder
subject when unaware of observation prefers to hold eating utensils
successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils
they had a case like that at johns hopkins
wires got crossed between hands and feet
ill try and find it on the net
subject climbs backyard tree
to perform elimination
when confronted with product
blames it on family dog
dead silence from the mortified group
they never had a case like that at johns hopkins
julie somehow keeps a stiff upper lip deeply embarrassed for stu but a scientist nonetheless
seems perfectly obvious
hes been possessed by a monkey
the others all glower at hutch for this egregious display of bad taste
stu bone and herb are standing outside the garage in formal attire as a crew of zoo workers load monkeybone dolls into a pickup
youre really gonna pop the question
got the ring
got the airline tickets
soon as they break that pinata well grab a cab and its off to the land of palm trees and coconuts
i cant believe you
you used to hate being the center of attention
now youre proposing in public at a benefit
yeah i was thinking
i mean im a celebrity now do i really want to get married
but on the other hand if youre married they cant testify against you
herb wonders if this is a joke decides it is and forces a chuckle
julie is getting dressed for the benefit when the phone rings
oh hutch what
hutch is at the sleep lab standing over the open refrigerator
the nightmare juice
somebody switched it for a beaker of grape kool aid
but whod would want to her eyes move to the window to stu bone out by the garage
call the police
ill be right over
two detectives examining the scene of the crime
the technical name is oneirix
its an enzyme
its present in the brains of cutting her off writing yeah yeah
and theres been no sign of a break in
remembering the janitor found a pair of torn up pants
it was the same night the monkey tipped her cage over
remember that julie
suddenly afraid yeah
i remember it vividly
liveried waiters scurrying all about in preparation for the benefit
zoo workers set up tables and chairs underneath a giant canopy
stu bone watches with satisfaction as the last of the dolls is loaded into a giant pinata in the shape of stanley
the big creaky swivel chair swings around revealing death
now if i may ask what kind of idiot sneaks into the land of death twice
the party hes addressing is stu whos stretched out horizontally strapped to a medieval torture rack with a whole posse of grim reapers standing guard around him
youre mad at me
you have every right to be
but were both mad at dark town
were both mad at hypnos
now youre gonna tell me it was all his idea
you were completely innocent im not going to tell you that
i wanted that e ticket
i wanted it so bad id stare you right in the face to get it and id do the same again
i have a girl up there
and i never i shouldve i just want to tell her i love her
im a simple man
im just doing my job
i enjoy my job
why does everyone want to make it difficult for me
stealing tickets switching bodies
it is so irresponsible
death im trying to make things right
take my soul
turn me into a paper doll
but give me just one lousy hour
well youd need a body
death gestures for the reapers to unshackle stu
if it wasnt for that comic strip of yours i wouldnt be doing this
but a good chuckle is darned hard to come by
chortling that one where monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal i thought i would die
coming from you thats quite a compliment
now come here
before i change my mind
death rears back and kicks him full force smack in the ass
the supernatural might of the blow sends stu rocketing upward through the a team of surgeons
the lead surgeon has his arm buried up to the elbow in the open torso of an organ donor
detaching the left kidney
screams all around as the organ donor sits bolt upright
the startled surgeon drops the kidney back into place
what the who the hell am i
youre an organ donor
am i dead
the chute didnt open
we kind of assumed i need this body
just for a few minutes
ill bring it back okay
the organ donor grabs a lab coat from a nearby rack and races out
and since stu is temporarily occupying the donors body we will henceforth refer to him as o
stu comes racing around a corridor
his lab coat is already covered with gore and hes having trouble holding his guts in
his pancreas spills out onto the floor just as two doctors stroll past
eyeing the pancreas might have someone take a look at that
the doctors move on
stu spots a janitors cart with a roll of duct tape on one shelf
he wraps it tightly around his midsection to keep his innards from falling out
then he runs for it
now the team of surgeons rounds the corner in hot pursuit
the lead surgeon spots o
stu at the end of the corridor and takes off after him
but he slips on the pancreas and goes sprawling
the pancreas goes flying down the hall where it gets squashed in rapid succession by a gurney and by a little old ladys motorized wheelchair
when the surgeons retrieve it its a hunk of pulp
i think it can still be saved
put it on ice
guests are beginning to arrive for the benefit
in the cages and habitats animals stare up at a gigantic monkeybone balloon
the bazoom toy rep is rounding a corner when herb pops out from behind a tree and blasts him with a jolt of purple gas from a monkeybone doll
he sputters and coughs
then he grabs the doll away and blasts herb right back
the two of them chase each other around the tree giggling
the bazoom reps wife in her formal gown affects a look of supreme mortification
stu climbs over the fence finds a hidden key and lets himself in
stu rushes frantically from room to room
no reply the joints empty
stu enters the studio and spots a newspaper on his drafting table
the paper is folded back to a big display ad for the benefit meet stu miley and monkeybone pm tonight
he checks the wall clock time is short
reaching into the drawer of the drafting table he pulls out a tackle box which contains old brushes
and a small velvet box
stu opens the velvet box to reveal grandmas antique ring
he hears growling behind him its buster
the dog looks up cocks his head and begins wagging his tail
somehow even though stus in a different body buster recognizes him
stu exits ring in hand
behind him buster is throwing a fit barking flinging himself at the screen door
he wants to come along
a bus pulls up at the corner and o
stu boards it
buster throws everything hes got at the door and it gives
he takes off after stu
as herb is walking toward the refreshment table an odd look crosses his face
all at once he begins to tug at his collar
he yanks his tie off doffs his jacket onto the pavement
the nightmare drug is kicking in
the whole zoo swims around him
all at once hes being attacked
by a horde of empty clothes
julie has arrived at the zoo
shes wandering zombie like through the food court flanked by her friends alice and clarissa
whatever hes done im responsible for it
thats not true julie
its not true
this is not about your guilt julie
there could be innocent people in danger
hes not the same guy
hes not your stu
beat i didnt want to tell you this but the other day he pinched me on the butt
i didnt want to tell you this but the other day he tried to mount me from behind
look you have to tell the police
tell them what
i dont know anything concrete
all i have is a feeling
all of a sudden they hear shouts and laughter from the area of the reptile house
in the distance zoo security guards are chasing a naked man through the crowds of formally dressed partygoers
oh my god weve got a flasher
the guards catch hold of herb and drag him away past julie alice and clarissa
he doesnt recognize any of them
hes psychotic clothes
beware of clothes
theyre working together
all of them
the three women exchange looks of stupefied horror
passengers are holding their noses frantically pulling on the bell rope to alert the driver that they want off
as we move toward the back we see o
stu sitting alone with rows of empty seats on either side
he looks rough
hes bone white his taped up lab coat is crusted with blood and he never did find any shoes
also its a hot night and hes starting to get a little ripe
flies are buzzing all around him
buster runs down the sidewalk as fast as his stumpy little legs will carry him in pursuit of the bus
the team of surgeons has been tracking o
stu across the city
through the windshield they see the bus pulling up outside the zoo
stu hops out and sprints across the parking lot
stu doesnt even stop at the ticket window
he vaults over the turnstile knocking benefit guests aside
the surgeons arent far behind
they race up to the ticket window did you see a corpse running this way
the ticket taker shrugs and points off in o
the last stages of dinner
waiters are already clearing plates and although julie has barely touched her food she sends her plate away
onstage a band is playing tasteful zoo jazz
when the number ends stu bone approaches the dais and leans into the mike
as emcee i want to thank you all for joining us at this swingin bash
its a special night for the birds and the lions and the monkeys but its also a special night for tapping his chest this monkey
and its special because of a very special lady
her name is checking a note in his pocket julie mcelroy
just kiddin julie
julie stands reluctantly
the crowd applauds
and to make this special night extra special id like to do a special number
especially for you
a disco ball lowers
stu bone turns to welcome a group of backup soul singers who are just joining the band on stage
the tent begins to rock with a throbbing beat
and stu bone launches into a wild eyed hip shaking parody of mick jagger singing the rolling stones monkey man
as he sings stu bone gyrates over toward julie bumping and grinding like the cartoon monkey sex machine he is
he waves his mike to the crowd urging everyone to join in
julie gasps in disbelief but the crowd is eating it up clapping and singing along with stu bone
he gestures for pretty women to join him out on the floor
he opens his shirt at the neck exposing a hitherto unseen plenitude of chest hair
he pulls out a hanky to mop his brow and tosses it to the crowd
he wipes his armpits with a second hanky and tosses it to the crowd
he blows his nose into a third and tosses it to the crowd
then he jumps up on the tables and shakes his booty wildly strutting in and out among the dessert plates
if the real jagger could see him he would creep home a sad and broken man
for the big finale he jumps off the table and slides across the floor to julies table arriving on his knees
i am just a monkey man
im glad you are a monkey
soft voice how about it julie
he pulls out a ring box and hands it to the beet red julie
the crowd lets out a collective gasp followed by wild applause
she stares down at the ring a big vulgar sparkler
she cant speak
well hop a plane tonight
an island ceremony
an abba dabba honeymoon
it looks so
it is new
why wouldnt it be new
but the heirloom ring
your grandmothers ring
you want a used ring
shes taking a long time to say yes
the audience is muttering
operators are standing by
offer expires at midnight december
suddenly a gore stained figure bursts into the tent
julies jaw drops
she barely gets a glimpse of o
stu before the zoo guards arrive to haul him away
boy the nuts are out tonight
whatd that creep call you
he called me doc
which stu bone never does
someone in the crowd yells
stu bone turns and does a simian comedy shtick for the crowd
thats me folks
by the time hes done scratching his ribs julie has vanished
she races out of the tent grabs a passing zoo guard
where did you take that man
the guard points to an animal control van
julie sees o
stu peering out through a small barred panel
their eyes meet
who are you
why did you say those things
oh doc its all a mixup
we were in the land of death
he stole my e ticket
thats how he got my body see
all they had left for me was this corpse
julie digests this nods professionally and turns to walk away
dont walk away doc
hes only here to give people nightmares
no response doc
dont you remember the dream
they were pulling the plug i called out to you and you heard me
this stops julie cold
her spine is tingling
she turns slowly a single tear rolling down her cheek
the dog runs right past julie and bounds up to the animal control van barking his head off
now julie is starting to believe
she turns stu
i had to come back julie
i had to give you this
through the bars he hands her the little box containing grandmas antique ring
i meant to give it to you before
the night we crashed
i was so happy julie i
try to remember me like that okay
not like this
she slips the ring on her finger looks up at o
stu with tears welling in her eyes
he makes an odd snorkeling kind of noise
im crying too
i just dont have any tears
im all dried up
the two detectives we saw in the sleep lab have just arrived at the gate and alice and clarissa are leading them over
detective please let this man out of the van
the partygoers are lined up under the gigantic stanley shaped pinata which is hanging from a tree
a tubby banker in a blindfold takes a good hard whack
cracks are beginning to appear
okay folks its pinata time you know the rules five bucks a pop and remember its all for the benefit of our friends the animals
eyes brightening oooooh
this ones on me
the next contestant is a gorgeous woman
he blindfolds her and embraces her from behind to help her with her grip on the bat
choke up baby
suddenly he notices the cops marching up with julie o
stu and co
he freezes terrified backs away from the babe and catches a bat in the face
several people rush up to help him as the cops consult with the benefit organizers
i dont understand officer
this is a benefit
surely this can wait until sorry maam
we need to question mr
miley on a most urgent matter
those dolls have been tampered with
stu comes marching through the crowd
he passes a life sized display of stanley and monkeybone
grabs the backpack off the stanley figure
and proceeds deliberately toward stu bone
the old command seems to retain its magical power because stu bone clutches his gut as if stricken at the sound of it
i mean it this time
back in the pack
stu bone bends over jerks and twitches becoming more simian by the moment as o
i can explain
i was sick of being a figment see
its awful being a figment
and i never really wanted to give people nightmares
i just told em that so theyd help me get a body
yeah my body
back in the pack you simian shitbird
the cops are tres confused by all this maam can you give me some idea of whats going on here
but julie holds them back so the scene can play itself out
now stu bone is doing a weird little monkey dance playing up to the puzzled crowd who laugh and snicker wondering what to make of all this
laugh damn you
laugh at the sidekick
the happy little monkey
he doesnt have any feelings
hes just a figment of your immagination
he turns suddenly grabs the bat from the puzzled babe he wails on the pinata like ken griffey jr
stu tries to stop him but its too late the pinata bursts and hundreds of purple assed monkeybone dolls spill out onto the ground
an equal number of rabid partygoers surge forward to scoop them up
the cops swing into action trying to hold the crowd back
stu bone climbs a tree and jumps from a branch onto one of the twin jungle towers at the pavilion begins climbing toward the giant monkeybone balloon moored up above
stu sees him pulls away from julie stu bone unties the mooring rope and wraps it around his midsection
now freed the balloon lifts into the air carrying him aloft
stu climbs up the opposite tower as the balloon starts to drift away
he grabs hold of the mooring rope as it whips past
and the team of surgeons who have been combing the grounds in search of o
stu catch sight of him just as he floats off into the air on they rise to an altitude of ten or twelve feet
stus additional weight pulls the balloon back down and both of them hit the ground
they have to run at top speed just to keep pace with the balloon
as hes trying to kick o
stu off the rope a gust of wind catches the balloon and lifts it high into the air
for about three seconds
the boys tumble to earth off balance in a heap bouncing along the pavement
the balloon pulls them over a wrought iron fence and drags them through the alligator pit
giant jaws snap as the boys glide overhead like bait on a hook
as the balloon lifts up again o
stu hauls himself along the length of the rope
he gets close enough to grab stu bones leg
stu bone reaches down to push him away
grabs a fistful of duct tape
the tape tears exposing the great big gash in o
he tries to pull himself together
a server ladles out a cup of punch from a big silver punchbowl
something pink comes plummeting out of the sky and the next thing he knows the server is drenched
the surgeons come rushing up
they all stick their hands in the punchbowl at once
fishing out o
put it on ice
i think it can still be saved
one of the team finds an ice cooler full of soft drinks
in it goes
both boys scream as the balloon drags them perilously close to the razor wire atop a tall storm fence
they clear it by inches but they dont have much time to celebrate
theyre dangling over the bengal tiger exhibit and the great cats are leaping into the air trying to snag them
stu squirms out of reach his liver drops out
it lands close enough to the fence that one of the surgeons thinks he can reach it
he reaches through the bars and sees a pack of bengal tigers racing toward him
he manages to grab one end of the liver but a tiger gets the other end and its a tug of war until the tiger bites the liver in half
sending the terrified surgeon sprawling on the pavement outside the bars
the head surgeon examines the remaining half liver
put it on ice
i think it can still be saved
stu bone socks o
stu hard across the face
he lets go of his incision and his small intestine falls out
since its still connected at both ends the intestine forms a great big loop
the server has just brought out a new punchbowl full of nice clean punch
he sets it down on the table and is about to ladle out a cupful when stu flies past overhead
his intestinal loop slides across the table knocking over glasses snagging the punchbowl at its base
and yanking it right off the table
bystanding guests are drenched in punch as the punch bowl flies end over end
and with the sound of a gong being struck beans a member of the surgical team from behind
naturally its the guy whos lugging the ice chest full of o
when the punchbowl strikes he goes down hard pitching the ice chest
at a pair of cops who are over by the pinata loading confiscated monkeybone dolls into a shopping cart
the ice chest knocks them off their feet and sends the shopping cart rolling downhill
the cops try to get up but they skid every which way on the spilled ice underneath
on top of which the surgical team is all over them playing grab ass with the cops as they try to retrieve precious organs
the head surgeon kneels beside his fallen comrade the guy who got beaned by the punchbowl and feels for a pulse
put him on ice
i think he can still be saved
cops sprint downhill trying to intercept the runaway shopping cart full of confiscated dolls
the cart slams into a fence and goes ass over teakettle dumping its contents into the penguin habitat
hypnos and an audience of darktowners peer into the nightmare orb
they see a keystone cops vision of fur clad eskimos with clubs and spearguns amid a colony of terrified penguins
that stinking monkey
stu gets an idea as he looks down at his dangling intestine
he begins feeding it out giving himself more rope to work with and when its long enough begins swinging it like a lasso
water buffalo graze buddha like as stus intestine snags one of them around the horns
the lasso draws taut and holds
the balloon is moored in place again
stu pulls himself upward toward stu bone who kicks at him frantically
a cop pulls his sidearm and takes aim at the now stabilized balloon
i think i can bring em down
the cops shot hits the giant monkeybone balloon smack in the ass
with a gale force helium fart the balloon zooms upward
the intestine snaps
stu bone and o
stu shoot off into the air
they exchange a look as the last gasp of helium hisses out of the gigantic balloon
then it occurs to them to look down
at the tiny cars parked far far below
they must be close to a hundred feet up in the air and all at once the ground is coming up fast
julie et al scream in horror as the two bodies plunge earthward
and falling and falling until they smack into the hot asphalt of the parking lot the deflated balloon settling over them like a shroud
their bodies have stopped but their spirits keep on falling
and the fight continues even into the afterlife
as they plummet down through the heavens they revert to their true personae
its stu vs
monkeybone creator vs
sidekick still duking it out like a couple of skydivers fighting over a single parachute
darktowners pour into the streets to watch the epic struggle overhead
theyre placing bets rooting their favorites on
the ground shakes and thunders and the darktowners scatter in all directions diving for the nearest hiding place
they seem to know what this mighty rumbing signifies
the e ticket ride pops out of the ground begins to rise into the air and a colossus appears beneath it
a fifty foot warrior clad in japanese ceremonial armor he towers over dark town so mighty and enormous that he can wear the e ticket ride as a hat
stu lands a haymaker and the two of them break loose of each other landing in the upturned palms of the colossus
stu watches in disbelief as a panel pops open in the giants chest revealing
i dress up when i want to make an impression
so howd it go
saw my girl said goodbye everythings gonna be okay
shrugging i guess im yours now
death id like to point out that none of this was my fault
the roots of this tragedy go back to a callous uncaring society that death lets out a mighty roar and claps his great metal hands together
man and monkey are surely squished
but when death opens his hands stu is still there cupped safely in his palms
back in your head where he belongs
beat no offense stu but on your own youre kinda vanilla
i didnt want to send you back without him
youre sending me back
its irregular but
i just love that strip of yours
i figure ill take the family circus guy instead
thank me next time you see me
he sends stu rocketing upward into the stratosphere with a single flick of his finger
then he turns
a bunch of frightened darktowners pitch the quivering satyr out into the middle of the town square
so nice to see you
i can explain he looks up tremulously
a giant shadow falls across him
followed by a julie sobs in a policemans arms at the exit to the zoo
i dont know what happened
all i know is
he was in a coma
and then he came back
and now hes gone again
they wander out
behind them a squad of cops are confiscating monkeybone dolls from squawling children as they file out
the two corpses on gurneys are being loaded into the back of the police ambulance
the surgeon and his team come wandering up
we lost a corpse we saw him heading this way
i got a couple of fresh ones in the back
the surgeon pulls the sheet off corpse aka o
its him all right
the second corpse sits up abruptly
his sheet falls away revealing stu the real stu
now back in his own body
the surgeon and his team run away from the ambulance shrieking
buster barks like a maniac
julie turns and sees an impossible vision ambling toward her
stu alive and kicking
she cant believe its him until he grabs her and pulls her close
is it you
is it really you this time
he pulls her close and kisses her long and hard quelling all doubts
tell me im not dreaming
youre asking the wrong guy
they wander off arm in arm
stu tugs at the seat of his pants
whats the matter
my tail itches
he does a take as he realizes what hes just said but julie smiles and he shrugs it off
