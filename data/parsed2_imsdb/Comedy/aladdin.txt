ah still good
camera begins to pan to right
peddler hurries to catch it
wait dont go
i can see that youre only interested in the exceptionally rare
i think then you would be most rewarded to consider
peddler pulls the magic lamp out from his sleeve
do not be fooled by its commonplace appearance
like so many things it is not what is outside but what is inside that counts
another pan this one slower to left
again peddler rushes to catch up
this is no ordinary lamp
it once changed the course of a young mans life
a young man who liked this lamp was more than what he seemed
a diamond in the rough
perhaps you would like to hear the tale
peddler pours shiny sand from the lamp into his hand
it begins on a dark night peddler throws sand into the sky where it forms a starry nightscape
where a dark man waits with a dark purpose
camera tilts down to find jafar sitting on his horse and iago on his shoulder
gazeem comes riding up to the pair
gazeem a thousand apologies o patient one
jafar you have it then
gazeem i had to slit a few throats to get it
pulls out half of the medallion
jafar reaches out for it but gazeem yanks it back
ah ah ahhh
iago squawks as he flies by and grabs the medallion
jafar trust me my pungent friend
youll get whats coming to you
iago whats coming to you
jafar pulls out the second half of the medallion
he connects them and the insect medallion begins to glow
finally it flies out of jafars hand scaring the horses and is off towards the dunes
jafar quickly follow the trail
all ride off following the glowing speck of light until it reaches a large dune
it separates into two and the halves plunge into the dune
all that remains are two glowing points of light on the dune
but then the dune begins to rise up transforming into a giant lions head with the glowing points serving as the eyes
jafar at last after all my years of searching the cave of wonders
cave of wonders
gazeem by allah
jafar now remember
bring me the lamp
the rest of the treasure is yours but the lamp is mine
gazeem starts to approach the lions mouth which forms the entrance to the cave
he chuckles as he goes
iago awk the lamp
awk the lamp
now that iago and jafar are alone iago opens up in normal english
jeez whered ya dig this bozo up
jafar puts his finger to his lips and shushes him
gazeem reaches the cave but is blown away by the roar of the caves speaking
cave who disturbs my slumber
gazeem it is i gazeem a humble thief
cave know this
only one may enter here
one whose worth lies far within
a diamond in the rough
gazeem turns to jafar with a questioning look
jafar what are you waiting for
gazeem hesitates then moves one foot inside the cave
with great apprehension he plants his foot down
relieved he begins his trek again
then another roar comes
he turns back but the lions mouth slams shut and the dune collapses back to normal
all that are left are jafar iago and the two separated halves of the medallion
cave seek thee out the diamond in the rough
iago unburied himself from the sand coughing as he does so
iago i cant believe it
i just dont believe it
were never gonna get a hold of that stupid lamp
just forget it
look at this

im so ticked off that im molting
he flies up to jafars shoulder
jafar patience iago

diamond in the rough
cut to a rooftop where aladdin rushes up to the edge carrying a loaf of bread
he almost drops it over the edge
guard stop thief
ill have your hands for a trophy street rat
aladdin looks back then down then at the bread
all this for a loaf of bread
he jumps off landing on two ropes strung between buildings with drying clothes on them
he skies down them collecting bits and pieces of clothing on him as he goes
finally hes nearing the end of the rope at a window when a woman reaches out and slams the shutters closed
aladdin slams into the shutters and falls to the street his fall being broken by numerous awnings and the pile of clothes around him
he pulls off the top layer of clothes and is about to enjoy his bread when
guard there he is
guard you wont get away so easy
aladdin you think that was easy
he looks at three women laughing at him

aladdin pulls a sheet over him and wraps himself as a disguise
he rushes over to the women
aladdin morning ladies

its the first guard
aladdins disguise falls off

abu dances on the guards head laughing
aladdin perfect timing abu

aladdin battles a guard wielding a sword
he dodges a couple of swings then pulls down the guards pants
abu raspberries the guard then dodges an attack
the guard swings at aladdin but destroys a barrel of fish
as aladdin runs off the guard pulls a fish over his lower body as a pair of pants
one jump ahead of the lawmen thats all and thats no joke these guys dont appreciate im broke
aladdin and abu scamper up a pile of barrels then kick one down on top of another guard
guards one at a time riffraff
aladdin just a little snack guys
aladdin scampers to the top of a platform
the guards shake the platform back and fro trying to knock him off
guards rip him open take it back guys
aladdin i can take a hint gotta face the facts youre my only friend abu
aladdin jumps off the platform to certain death only to grab abus hands like an acrobat
the pair swing into a harem

aladdin and abu exit
cut to muscleman flexing to a crowd
the guards rush past

one jump ahead of the slowpokes one skip ahead of my doom next time gonna use a nom de plume
one jump ahead of the hitmen one hit ahead of the flock i think ill take a stroll around the block
a chase sequence in which aladdin and abu pursued by the guards race through a flock of sheep hurdle a man sleeping on a bed of nails of course one
extremely large guard lands on him
abu disguises himself with jewels until a shopkeeper discovers him
crowd stop thief
aladdin lets not be too hasty aladdin is surrounded by guards in front of a door
the door opens and a large ugly lady comes out
lady still i think hes rather tasty aladdin tumbles away then puts his arm around a guard acting like theyre all chums
aladdin gotta eat to live gotta steal to eat otherwise wed get along
they all jump into a pile and fight
when they stop aladdin and abu are gone
they are sneaking away in barrels
they run across a flaming pit followed by guards who hop up and down screaming in pain as they cross the rocks
aladdin and abu pass a sword swallower then abu goes back pulls the sword out of the swallowers mouth
abu advances on the guards who retreat in fear
guard hes got a sword
guard you idiot weve all got swords
abu sets the sword down gently then runs
aladdin and abu are once again surrounded with guards coming from left and right
he jumps up and climbs a robe trick being done on the street as the guards all crash into each other
aladdin one jump ahead of the hoofbeats
aladdin one hop ahead of the hump
crowd street rat
aladdin one trick ahead of disaster crowd scoundrel
aladdin theyre quick but im much faster crowd take that
the guards chase aladdin up a staircase into a room
he grabs a carpet and jumps out the window aladdin here goes better throw my hand in wish me happy landin all i gotta do is jump
the guards follow him out the window but they go straight down to the street and land in a pile with the sign crazy hakims discount fertilizer
aladdin uses the carpet as a parachute to land safely and out of danger
aladdin and abu high five each other
aladdin and now esteemed effendi we feast
aladdin breaks the bread in two and gives half to abu who begins to eat
but aladdin looks over and sees two young children rummaging through the garbage for food
the girl sees him then drops her find and tries to hide
aladdin looks at them then the bread then at abu
abu uh oh
abu takes a big bite of his food but aladdin gets up and walks over to the children
the girl pulls her brother back
aladdin here go on take it
the children giggle with delight
abu tries to swallow his bite then looks guilty
he walks over to the children and offers his bread to them
in delight they pet him on the head
abu ah dont
abu sees aladdin walking into the daylight where there is a parade going on
aladdin peers over the shoulders of people
he sees prince achmed riding on a horse
bystander on his way to the palace i suppose
bystander another suitor for the princess
aladdin is startled as the two children come running out from the alley
the boy runs out in front of the princes horse startling it
prince out of my way you filthy brat
the prince brings up his whip to attack the children but aladdin jumps in front of them and catches the whip
aladdin hey if i were as rich as you i could afford some manners prince oh i teach you some manners
the prince kicks aladdin into a mud puddle
the crowd laugh at him
aladdin look at that abu
its not every day you see a horse with two rear ends
the prince stops and turns back to aladdin
prince you are a worthless street rat
you were born a street rat youll die a street rat and only your fleas will mourn you
aladdin rushes the prince but the doors to the castle slam shut in his face
aladdin im not worthless
and i dont have fleas
come on abu
lets go home
aladdin makes the climb to his home with the view then tucks in abu for the night
aladdin riffraff street rat
i dont buy that
if only theyd look closer would they see a poor boy
theyd find out theres so much more to me
he pulls back a curtain to reveal the beautiful palace
someday abu things are gonna change
well be rich live in a palace and never have any problems at all
dissolve to same shot during day
cut to int
of sultans chamber
the door bursts open and prince achmed storms in missing the rear end of his pants
prince ive never been so insulted
sultan oh prince achmed
youre not leaving so soon are you
prince good luck marrying her off
sultan oh jasmine
the sultan goes off into the garden looking for his daughter
he finds her but is interrupted by rajah jasmines pet tiger who blocks him off
rajah has a piece of the princes undershorts in his mouth
the sultan grabs the cloth and yanks it out of rajahs mouth
confound it rajah
so this is why prince achmed stormed out
jasmine oh father
rajah was just playing with him werent you rajah
rajah comes over and allows jasmine to pet and hug him
you were just playing with that overdressed self absorbed prince achmed werent you
she cuddles with rajah enjoying the moment until she looks up at her angry father
sultan dearest youve got to stop rejecting every suitor that comes to call
the law says you
must be married to a prince
they walk over to a dove cage
sultan by your next birthday
jasmine the law is wrong
sultan youve only got three more days
jasmine father i hate being forced into this
she takes a dove out of the cage and pets it
if i do marry i want it to be for love
sultan jasmine its not only this law
she hands him the dove and he puts it back in the cage
im not going to be around forever and i just want to make sure youre taken care of provided for
jasmine try to understand
ive never done a thing on my own
she swirls her finger in the water of the pond petting the fish
ive never had any real friends
rajah looks up at her and growls
except you rajah
satisfied he goes back to sleep
ive never even been outside the palace walls
sultan but jasmine youre a princess
jasmine then maybe i dont want to be a princess
she splashes the water
allah forbid you should have any daughters
rajah looks up and thinks for a second
jasmine goes to the dove cage and yanks open the door
the birds fly off into freedom
she watches them go
cut to int
of sultans chambers
sultan i dont know where she gets it from
her mother wasnt nearly so picky
a shadow falls over him
he looks up startled and sees jafar
ah jafar my most trusted advisor
i am in desperate need of your wisdom
jafar my life is but to serve you my lord
sultan its this suitor business
jasmine refuses to choose a husband
im at my wits end
iago in the parrot voice awk
sultan oh ha ha
have a cracker pretty polly
he pulls a cracker out from his pocket
iago looks terrified
then the sultan stuffs it in iagos mouth
iago grimaces as he tries to eat it
jafar and the sultan both laugh
jafar your majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals
iago glares at him
now then perhaps i can divine a solution to this thorny problem
sultan if anyone can help its you
jafar ah but it would require the use of the mystic blue diamond
sultan uh my ring
but its been in the family for years
jafar it is necessary to find the princess a suitor
jafar says the word princess with the accent on the second syllable cess
he turns his staff with a cobra head towards the sultan
the eyes of the staff begin to glow
the room darkens jafars voice slows down and deepens
the sultans eyes get a hypnotized look
everything will be fine
jafar the diamond
sultan here jafar
whatever you need will be fine
the sultan removes his ring and hands it to jafar
the room returns to normal as jafar pulls back the staff
jafar you are most gracious my liege
now run along and play with your little toys
sultan still hypnotized yes
jafar and iago exit
we follow them
when theyre out of the room the parrot spits out the cracker
iago i cant take it anymore
if i gotta choke down on one more of those moldy disgusting crackers
jafar pulls a rope which reveals a hidden entrance to his chambers
jafar calm yourself iago
iago then id grab him around the head
jafar speaking over iago
soon i will be sultan not that addlepated twit
iago and then i stuff the crackers down his throat
the pair pass through a door and slam it shut
gardens at night
a shadowy figure walks through
we see it is jasmine in disguise
she reaches the palace wall then begins to climb it
she is tugged from behind by rajah
jasmine oh im sorry rajah
but i cant stay here and have my life lived for me
ill miss you
she begins to climb again and is helped up by rajah who begins to whine and whimper
she disappears over the wall
cut to daytime on the street aladdin and abu are up to their capers again
they are on top of the awning of a fruit stand
aladdin okay abu
abu dips over the edge and looks at the proprietor
proprietor to passing crowd try this your taste buds will dance and sing
abu grabs a melon and hangs there distracting his attention
hey get your paws off that
abu blah blah blah
proprietor why you
get away from here you filthy ape
he grabs the melon away from abu
but in the foreground aladdin dips down and snatches another melon from the stand
abu bye bye
he zings back up
the proprietor takes the melon to the front where he places it on top of a stack
he looks confused like he has just done this
aladdin nice goin abu
breakfast is served
aladdin and abu on the roof break open the melon and eat
we see j asmine walking through the street
shopkeeper pretty lady buy a pot
no finer pot in brass or silver
shopkeeper sugar dates sugar dates and figs
sugar dates and pistachios
shopkeeper would the lady like a necklace
a pretty necklace for a pretty lady
she is charmed by the action but is startled by a fish thrust into her face
shopkeeper fresh fish
we catch em you buy em
jasmine i dont think so
she backs away but bumps into a fire eater who is startled into swallowing his fire
oh excuse me
he gulps then belches fire from his mouth
jasmine is disgusted
he is pleased and taps his stomach
aladdin sees her and a strange look comes over his face
im really very sorry
aladdin hes obviously deeply in love with her
she pulls the hood of her cloak over her head
abu sees him and jumps up on his shoulder waving his hand in front of aladdins face
abu uh oh
jasmine stops at the fruit stand and sees a young homeless child reaching for a piece of fruit
she picks one up and gives it to him
jasmine oh you must be hungry
here you go
the boy runs off
proprietor youd better be able to pay for that
jasmine mystified pay
proprietor no one steals from my cart
jasmine oh im sorry sir
i dont have any money
jasmine please if you let me go to the palace i can get some from the sultan
proprietor do you know what the penalty is for stealing
he takes her hand and pins it down on the table intending to chop it off
jasmine no no please
the sword drops but his hand is stopped by aladdins
aladdin thank you kind sir
im so glad youve found her
ive been looking all over for you
jasmine whispering what are you doing
aladdin whispering back just play along
proprietor you know this girl
jasmine sadly yes
she is my sister
shes a little crazy
he circles his finger around his ear
she is shocked
the proprietor grabs him by the vest
proprietor she said she knows the sultan
aladdin she thinks the monkey is the sultan
abu is picking a pocket
he hears this then straightens up
jasmine playing along kneels and bows to abu
jasmine oh wise sultan
how may i serve you
abu well blah blah blah blah
aladdin tragic isnt it
he leans forward picking up another apple from the cart with his foot
but no harm done
walks over to jasmine
now come along sis
time to see the doctor
jasmine to a camel standing nearby oh hello doctor
how are you
aladdin no no no
not that one
to abu whose pockets are bulging
come on sultan
abu bows to the crowd and everything hes stolen from the cart falls out
what is it
abu picks up what he can carry and the trio run off
come back here you little thieves
cut to int
of jafars lab
iago is running on a gear in a bizarre contraption
at the top of the contraption is a storm brewing
iago huffing and puffing with all due respect your rottenness couldnt we just wait for a real storm
jafar save your breath iago
he places the sultans ring in the contraption
iago yes o mighty evil one
iago runs faster
a lightning bolt streaks through the ring passing into an hourglass below
the sands begin to swirl
jafar ah sands of time reveal to me the one who can enter the cave
the sand in top forms the cave of wonders
it falls through into a storm but it shows aladdin climbing up a ladder followed by jasmine who is covered in her cloak
there he is
my diamond in the rough
iago thats him
thats the clown weve been waitin for
iago loses his footing and is sucked into the gears
jafar lets have the guards extend him an invitation to the palace shall we
iago goes flying past and slams into the wall upside down
jafar laughs hideously and the camera zooms in on the sandstorm with aladdin in it
finally we dissolve into the real aladdin climbing to the top of the ladder followed by jasmine
aladdin almost there
jasmine climbs over the top but trips and falls into aladdins arms
she stands up
jasmine i want to thank you for stopping that man
aladdin uh forget it
he grabs a pole
so uh this is your first time in the marketplace huh
aladdin pole vaults to the next building leaving jasmine behind
jasmine is it that obvious
aladdin well you do kinda stand out
he stares at her still in love
she returns the look
but he realizes what he is doing and returns to normal
i mean uh you dont seem to know how dangerous agrabah can be
he lays a plank between the buildings for her to walk over but as he is leaned down she vaults over his head
he looks back in surprise
she tosses the pole to him
both aladdins and abus eyes bulge
jasmine im a fast learner
cmon this way
they go inside the roof of a building dodging planks and beams as they go
watch your head there
jasmine is this where you live
just me and abu
come and go as we please
aladdin well its not much he pulls back the curtain and exposes the palace but its got a great view
palace looks pretty amazing huh
jasmine oh its wonderful
aladdin i wonder what it would be like to live there to have servants and valets
jasmine oh sure
people who tell you where to go and how to dress
aladdin its better than here
always scraping for food and ducking the guards
jasmine youre not free to make your own choices
aladdin sometimes you feel so jasmine youre just both in unison trapped
they look at each other realizing that theyre perfect for one another
but aladdin then realizes where he is and breaks the look
he takesthe apple out of abus hand and rolls it down his arm into the hand of jasmine
aladdin so wherere you from
jasmine what does it matter
i ran away and i am not going back
he takes a bite from the apple in his hand then hands it to abu who has a disgusted look on his face
abu why you
aladdin walks over and sits next to jasmine
jasmine my fathers forcing me to get married
aladdin thats thats awful
abu appears from behind the princess and tries to steal the apple
abu races up to a higher point chattering and cursing as he goes
aladdin abu says that uh thats not fair
jasmine oh did he
aladdin yeah of course
jasmine and does abu have anything else to say
aladdin well uh he wishes there was something he could do to help
abu oh boy
jasmine hmm tell him thats very sweet
aladdin and jasmine have been getting closer and closer until aladdin leans in to kiss her
he is interrupted however by the guards who have found them
guard here you are
aladdin and jasmine theyve found me
to each other theyre after you
jasmine my father must have sent them aladdin do you trust me
aladdin do you trust me
he extends his hand jasmine yes
she takes it
aladdin then jump
they both jump off the roof fall and land in a pile of salt
they try to get away but the exit is blocked by a guard
guard we just keep running into each other dont we street rat
again the guards turban is pulled down by abu but more guards are here and block the exit
the first guard pulls abu off his head and throws him in a vase
three other guards grab aladdin
guard its the dungeon for you boy
aladdin hey get off of me
jasmine let go of him
guard not realizing she is the princess look what we have here men a street mouse
he throws her down
jasmine standing up and pulling off the hood of her cloak unhand him by order of the princess
the guards suddenly stop and bow forcing aladdin to bow as well
guard princess jasmine
aladdin the princess
abu peeking out from the vase the princess
guard what are you doing outside the palace
and with this street rat
jasmine thats not your concern
do as i command
guard well i would princess but my orders come from jafar
youll have to take it up with him
the guards drag aladdin out bowing as they go
jasmine getting a very pissed off look believe me i will
cut to int
of palace jafar emerging from his secret chambers
he slides the door shut carefully but the princess comes storming in before he is finished
he slams it shut pinning iago inside the door frame
jafar oh uh princess
jafar im stuck
jafar how may i be of service to you
he spreads out his cape hiding the door
jasmine the guards just took a boy from the market on your orders
jafar your fathers charged me with keeping peace in agrabah
the boy was a criminal
jasmine what was the crime
iago i cant breathe jafar
jafar why kidnapping the princess of course
iago if you could just jafar kicks him back inside the door and it slams shut wow that hurt
jasmine he didnt kidnap me

jafar walking away as if shocked oh dear

jasmine what do you mean
jafar sadly the boys sentence has already been carried out
jasmine what sentence
jafar with a sinister tone death
she collapses to the floor
jafar i am exceedingly sorry princess
jasmine how could you
she runs from the room crying
iago finally makes it out through the door
he flies up and lands on jafars shoulder coughing
iago so how did it go
jafar i think she took it rather well
they both get a sinister smile on their faces
to jasmine at night crying at the edge of the fountain
rajah comes over to comfort her
she pets him
jasmine its all my fault rajah
i didnt even know his name
cut to int
rats scurry by and we descend until we see aladdin chained to the wall
aladdin to himself she was the princess
i dont believe it
i must have sounded so stupid to her
abu from a distance yoo hoo
abu appears at the window at the top of the dungeon
hey cmon help me outta these
abu stops then begins chattering wildly dropping to the ground
he wraps a cloth around his head and makes his eyes big in an imitation of the princess
aladdin hey she was in trouble
ah she was worth it
abu jumps up on aladdins shoulders and pulls a small set of tools out of his pocket then frees aladdin
abu yeah yeah yeah
aladdin dont worry abu
ill never see her again
im a street rat remember and theres a law
shes gotta marry a prince she deserves it
abu finally frees aladdins hands
abu ta da
aladdin rubbing his wrists im a im a fool old man youre only a fool if you give up boy
we see an old man sitting in the corner that neither aladdin nor abu have seen before
aladdin who are you
old man a lowly prisoner like yourself
but together perhaps we can be more
aladdin im listening
old man there is a cave boy
a cave of wonders
filled with treasures beyond your wildest dreams
treasure enough to impress even your princess id wager
listeners will note that the old man pronounced the word princess as prin cess rather than the standard pronunciation of prin cess
the old man turns his back and iago sticks his head out of jafars old man disguise
iago jafar can ya hurry it up
im dyin in here
aladdin but the law says that only a prince can marry old man youve heard of the golden rule havent you boy
whoever has the gold makes the rules
he grins showing a hideously bad mouth
aladdin so why would you share all of this wonderful treasure with me
old man i need a young man with strong legs and a strong back to go in after it
aladdin ah one problem
its out there were in here
the old man walks to a wall and pushes open a hidden exit
old man mmm mmm mmm
things arent always what they seem
so do we have a deal
aladdin looks at abu who shrugs his shoulders
abu oh hmm
cut to desert scene
we see aladdin leading a horse with the old man and abu on it
to cave of wonders
cave who disturbs my slumber
aladdin it is i aladdin
touch nothing but the lamp
the cave opens up with a roar and a staircase appears in front of old man remember boy first fetch me the lamp and then you shall have your reward
aladdin cmon abu
to abu hiding under the shoulder of his vest
aladdin begins to descend the staircase
he reaches the bottom and enters a golden chamber filled with treasure
aladdin would ya look at that
abu uh oh
aladdin just a handful of this stuff would make me richer than the sultan
abu peeks out sees the treasure then bolts for it
abu stops in mid run hovering over a rug on the floor
we gotta find that lamp
they begin to make their way through the room when the carpet rises off the floor and begins following them
abu gets the feeling theyre being followed
he turns and the carpet lies flat on the floor
he continues and the carpet begins to follow again
again abu turns back but the carpet is rolled up and leaning against a pile of treasure
abu runs to aladdin and tugs his pant leg
aladdin abu will ya knock it off
again the carpet follows but this time when abu turns the carpet jumps to the other side
it reaches down with a tassel and pulls abus tail
when abu jumps around carpet again goes to the other side
this time abu lands in a karate stance
carpet reaches down and plucks abus hat off then puts it on himself
abu sits thinking for a second until carpet waves a tassel in front of his face
abu and carpet both jump scared and run away
abu tackles aladdin and turns his head to look at the carpet
aladdin abu what are you crazy
the carpet peeks out from behind a pile of treasure
aladdin a magic carpet
im not gonna hurt you
the carpet slowly comes out shyly then picks up abus hat and dusts it off
it flies over to aladdin and hands the hat to abu next to him
abu screeches and jumps onto aladdins shoulder
aladdin take it easy abu
hes not gonna bite
the carpet again picks up abus hat and hands it to him
abu shakes his fist and screeches at it
carpet begins to walk away sadly
aladdin hey wait a minute
maybe you can help us
carpet looks back excited
it then flies over and wraps around the pair
you see were trying to find this lamp
carpet motions for them to follow it
i think he knows where it is
they pass through a long cave until they emerge in a giant underground cavern
in the centre of the room is a tall pillar with a staircase going up to it
it is surrounded by water with unevenly placed stones forming a bridge
at the top of the pillar is a beam of light
aladdin begins to cross the bridge
aladdin wait here
abu sees a shrine with a golden monkey
the outstretched paws hold a giant ruby
abu is hypnotically drawn to it
aladdin climbs the stairs quickly
carpet sees abu and grabs his tail trying in vain to hold him back
aladdin finally reaches the magic lamp
aladdin this is it
this is what we came all the way down here to he looks down and sees abu break free of carpets hold and lunge toward the jewel
abu abu grabs the jewel
there is a rumbling and the room begins to shake
cave voice infidels
abu uh oh
cave voice you have touched the forbidden treasure
abu places the jewel back into the paw but the jewel and the shrine melt into lava
now you will never again see the light of day
aladdin races down the steps but they flatten into a ramp and he skies down until he flies into the air
the water has turned into lava
he is falling toward it when all of a sudden carpet appears and catches him
abu is standing on one of the rocks of the bridge
he looks left and right and sees rocks exploding into lava
then carpet races over and aladdin grabs him just as the last rock is exploding
carpet lets move
together they race back through the caves dodging walls and falling debris
abu grabs aladdins head and covers his eyes
aladdin abu this is no time to panic
he pulls abu off his head and sees they are flying into a wall
carpet goes into a dive then through another cave
finally they emerge through the internal entrance
outside the cave begins to growl and close
carpet and company are almost to the top when a boulder drops on carpet sending it to the floor
aladdin grabs onto the rock wall and holds on
he sees the old man at the top within reach
aladdin help me out
old man throw me the lamp
aladdin i cant hold on
give me your hand
old man first give me the lamp
aladdin reaches in and pulls out the magic lamp
he hands it up a nd the old man raises it above his head
old man ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha
aladdin has climbed out with the assistance of abu
but the old man kicks aside abu and grabs aladdins wrist
aladdin what are you doing
old man giving you your reward
jafar returns to his normal voice
your eternal reward
he pulls out a crooked dagger and is about to stab aladdin when abu bites him on the wrist
he screams but lets go of aladdin who falls into the cave
old man throws abu into the cave as well
carpet sees this but is pinned under a boulder
it struggles to break free then does
it races up and catches aladdin but he has already hit the wall several times and is unconscious
on the surface the cave roars one final time then sinks back into the sand
jafar pulls off his disguise
jafar heh heh heh
its all mine
i he cant find it in his pocket where is it
kiss fade to jasmines bedroom
she is sitting on her bed next to rajah who looks sad
the sultan walks in
she looks as if shes been crying
sultan there there there my child well set it right
now tell me everything
cut to int
aladdin lies unconscious on the carpet
abu tries to wake him
abu oh oh
carpet rises up lifting aladdin up
he awakes slowly
aladdin oh my head
he looks at the entrance sealed in
angry shaking his fists at the entrance that two faced son of a jackal
calmer whoever he was hes long gone with that lamp
abu pulls out the magic lamp
aladdin why you hairy little thief
looks like such a beat up worthless piece of junk
hey i think theres something written here but its hard to make out
he rubs the lamp
suddenly smoke comes out of the hole the lamp begins to shake and glow but aladdin holds onto the lamp and our wonderful friend the genie comes out
ten thousand years will give ya such a crick in the neck
he hangs aladdin on a nearby rock
then he pulls his head off and spins it around yelling as he does so
carpet pulls a aladdin down
does it feel good to be outta there
genie uses the lamp end of himself as a microphone
nice to be back ladies and gentlemen
hi where ya from
sticks the mic in aladdins face
whats your name
aladdin uh al uh aladdin
genie says his name as if hes discovered something major aladdin
a neon sign lights up with aladdins name on it circled by chase lights
the sign changes to reflect the genies upcoming line
nice to have you on the show
can we call you al
or maybe just din
or how bout laddi
genie disappears then a dog wrapped in plaid jumps in
sounds like here boy
aladdin shaking his head i must have hit my head harder than i thought
genie still a dog do you smoke
mind if i do
dog poofs into smoke then back to the genie
abu screeches wildly
oh sorry cheetah hope i didnt singe the fur
havent seen you in a few millennia
slap me some tassel
carpet flies over and high fives the genie
genie looks at aladdin
say youre a lot smaller than my last master
lifts his beer gut
either that or im gettin bigger
look at me from the side do i look different to you
aladdin wait a minute
im your master
genie slaps a diploma in aladdins hand and a mortarboard on his head
he can be taught
what would you wish of me as arnold schwarzenegger the ever impressive inside a cube the long contained as a ventriloquist with a dummy often imitated tosses the dummy aside
but never duplicated he multiplies into multiple genies who surround him
genies duplicated duplicated duplicated duplicated duplicated duplicated duplicated duplicated duplicated
genie says it like a ring announcer at a boxing match
goes into ed sullivan right here direct from the lamp right here for your enjoyment wish fulfillment
genie three wishes to be exact
and ix nay on the wishing for more wishes
turns into a slot machine arm pulls down and three genies appear in the windows
thats it three
three genie caballeros come out of the slot
uno dos tres
changes into b w groucho marx
no substitutions exchanges or refunds
the duck drops with the secret word refunds
aladdin to abu now i know im dreaming
genie music for friend like me begins master i dont think you quite realize what youve got here
so why dont you just ruminate whilst i illuminate the possibilities
genie lights up like a fluorescent light well ali baba had them forty thieves scheherazadie had a thousand tales but master you in luck cause up your sleeve you got
a brand of magic never fails
genie produces thieves who surround aladdin with swords
genie appears in his vest then sticks his arms out and boxes the thieves into submission
you got some power in your corner now some heavy ammunition in your camp you got some punch pizzazz yahoo and how see all you gotta do is rub that
lamp and ill say boxing ring appears aladdin in the corner being massaged by genie
then genie turns into a pile of fireworks and explodes
then genie appears inside lamp and grabs aladdins hand and rubs lamp with it
mister aladdin sir what will your pleasure be
let me take your order jot it down you aint never had a friend like me no no no
genie produces a table and chairs then writes down things on a note pad like a waiter
life is your restaurant and im your maitre d
cmon whisper what it is you want you aint never had a friend like me
genie appears as a plate of chicken then returns to normal but enlarges his ear to listen to aladdin
finally he explodes into four duplicate genies
yes sir we pride ourselves on service youre the boss the king the shah
say what you wish its yours
true dish how about a little more baklava
the genies give him a shave haircut and manicure then aladdin appears in a comfy chair eh
surrounded by the treasure and being fanned by women
the genie appears and fills the screen with baklava
try some of column a try all of column b im in the mood to help you dude you aint never had a friend like me aladdin rises up on
a column of food with a giant a on top then jumps to another column with a b on top
he falls off and is caught by a cushion held by genie
he opens his mouth and his tongue turns into a staircase
a miniature genie dressed like a magician comes out
the mini genie does a little dance with the genies two giant hands
at the end they surround the mini genie and squish him into nothing
can your friends do this
do your friends do that
do your friends pull this out their little hat can your friends go poof
well looky here can your friends go abracadabra let er rip and then make the sucker disappear
the genie pulls off his head duplicates it then juggles them
he tosses them to aladdin who juggles with one hand and spins one of the heads on his fingertip like a basketball
he tosses the heads back onto the genie who proceeds to try and pull himself out of a hat at his base
he spirals around and around until he turns into a white rabbit
the rabbit transforms into a purple dragon very reminiscent of figment from epcot center
the dragon breathes fire which turns into three harem girls who dance around aladdin
just as he begins to enjoy them they disappear
so dont you sit there slack jawed buggy eyed im here to answer all your midday prayers you got me bona fide certified you got a genie for a charg
i got a powerful urge to help you out so what you wish i really want to know you got a wish thats three miles long no doubt so all
you gotta do is rub like so and oh
genie imitates what he is calling aladdin then turns into a certificate which rolls up and surrounds aladdin
genie pulls a list written in arabic out of aladdins ear which he uses to rub his behind like drying off after a shower
mister aladdin sir have a wish or two or three im on the job you big nabob you aint never had a friend never had a friend you aint never
had a friend never had a friend you aint never
you aint never had a friend like me
the dancing harem girls reappear and aladdin leans in to kiss one
she turns into the genie who zaps four dancing elephants into existence
to the other direction he zaps in four dancing camels and a grand finale dancing number ensues
abu grabs as much gold as he can but the genie wraps everything up in a cyclone and zaps it away until theyre all back in the cave
genie has a neon applause sign on his back
abu turns his hat over and sees that is is empty
genie so whatll it be master
aladdin youre gonna grant me any three wishes i want
genie as william f
buckley ah almost
there are a few provisos a couple of quid pro quos aladdin like
genie ah rule number one i cant kill anybody
he slices his head off with his finger
so dont ask
rule two i cant make anyone fall in love with anyone else
head turns into a big pair of lips which kiss aladdin
you little punim there
lies flat then gets up and transforms into a zombie
rule three i cant bring people back from the dead
its not a pretty picture he grabs aladdin and shakes him i dont like doing it
he poofs back to normal
other than that you got it
aladdin looks at abu as if plotting ah provisos
you mean limitations
to abu some all powerful genie cant even bring people back from the dead
i dont know abu he probably cant even get us out of this cave
looks like were gonna have to find a way out of here they start to leave but a big blue foot stomps down in front of them
genie excuse me

did you rub my lamp
did you wake me up did you bring me here
and all of a sudden youre walkin out on me
gets madder and madder i dont think so not right now
youre gettin your wishes so siddown
they all get on carpet
genie takes the form of a stewardess with lots of arms pointing out the exits
in case of emergency the exits are here here here here here here here here here here here here anywhere
keep your hands and arms inside the carpet
the carpet and passengers fly out of the sand in the desert and off into the distance
cut to int
of sultans chamber
jafar is there with iago jasmine and the sultan
sultan jafar this is an outrage

genie still as stewardess thank you for choosing magic carpet for all your travel needs

aladdin genie i wish for you to make me a prince
genie all right
woof woof woof woof
takes on square shoulders and looks like arsenio hall
then becomes a tailor fashion designer
first that fez and vest combo is much too third century
these patches what are we trying to say beggar
lets work with me here
he takes aladdins measurements snaps his fingers and aladdin is outfitted in his prince costume
i like it muy macho
now still needs something
what does it say to me
it says mode of transportation
excuse me monkey boy
aqui over here
abu tries to cover himself with carpet but genie zaps him and he flies over
abu uh oh
genie here he comes aladdin and genie are on a game show set where aladdin stands behind a podium with al on it
and what better way to make your grand entrance on the streets of agrabah than riding your very own brand new camel
watch out it spits
a door bearing the genies head on it opens where abu is transformed into a camel
he spits out the side of his mouth on cue
but the genies not sure
mmm not enough
he snaps his fingers and abu turns into a fancy white horse
still not enough
what do you need
the genie snaps his fingers repeatedly turning abu into a duck an ostrich a turtle and a cadillac with license plate abu
that ones a guess i dont know cars but judging by the tail fins nuff said
finally hes returned to normal
esalalumbo shimin dumbo
and on the keyword of the spell dumbo abu turns into an elephant
carpet struggles to get out from under abus size feet
talk about your trunk space check this action out
abu sees his reflection in a pool of water then jumps into a tree
the tree naturally bends right back down to the ground where abu hangs on and looks at aladdin upside down
aladdin abu you look good
genie hes got the outfit hes got the elephant but were not through yet
hang on to your turban kid cause were gonna make you a star
we zoom out slowly with the oasis in the distance as fireworks begin to explode outward
cut to a cu of a pile of toys
look for the beast here
we tilt up and see the sultan balancing them
he carefully balances the last piece on top then sits back and sighs
jafar storms in though and the pile collapses
jafar sire i have found a solution to the problem with your daughter
the problem with your daughter
sultan oh really
jafar unrolling a scroll right here
if the princess has not chosen a husband by the appointed time then the sultan shall choose for her
sultan but jasmine hated all those suitors
he tries to stuff a cracker into iagos mouth
iago backs away
the sultan absentmindedly pulls the cracker back
how could i choose someone she hates
iago is relieved but the sultan quickly stuffs a cracker in his mouth
jafar not to worry my liege
there is more
if in the event a suitable prince cannot be found a princess must then be wed to
jafar the royal vizier
why that would be
sultan why i thought the law says that only a prince can marry a princess im quite sure
jafar desperate times call for desperate measures my lord
he pulls out the staff and hypnotizes the sultan with it
jafar you will order the princess to marry me
the spell breaks momentarily
but youre so old
jafar holds the staff closer the princess will marry me
sultan the princess will marry
the spell is again broken this time by the trumpet fanfare of prince ali
what is that
ha ha ha
you must come and see this
we see an advancing parade led by what appears to be the genie in human form as a major
marchers make way for prince ali
swordsmen say hey
its prince ali
major hey clear the way in the old bazaar hey you let us through its a bright new star now come be the first on your block to meet his
make way here he comes ring bells bang the drums

prince ali fabulous he ali ababwa
genuflect show some respect down on one knee abu the elephant marches through town with aladdin ali on his back
now try your best to stay calm brush up your sunday salaam and come and meet his spectacular coterie
iago is dancing to the music until jafar glares at him
the major wheelbarrows six men up onto abus trunk
they stand on each others shoulders as ali shakes hands
prince ali mighty is he ali ababwa
strong as ten regular men definitely he faced the galloping hordes a hundred bad guys with swords who sent those goons to their lords why prince ali
the pile collapses on ali but a genie tm brand lightning bolt zaps the pile and he ends up holding them all up in an acrobatic wheel formation
the genie turns into an old man then a child and speaks the last two lines to the crowd
chorus of men carrying the camels hes got seventy five golden camels
in pops a typical parade commentator harry dont they look lovely june
chorus of women on a float purple peacocks hes got fifty three
in comes another commentator
june fabulous harry i love the feathers
genie genie is off screen a giant balloon gorilla proceeds down the parade when it comes to exotic type mammals has he got a zoo im telling you its a
world class menagerie
genie pops in as a leopard then a goat and speaks the last two lines to the two children from earlier
we cut to a balcony where three harem girls are joined by the harem genie
girls in couterpoint prince ali handsome is he ali ababwa theres no question this alis alluring that physique how can i speak never ordinary never boring weak at the knee
everything about the man just plain impresses well get on out in that square hes a wonder hes a whiz a wonder adjust your veil and prepare hes about to pull my heart asunder to gawk and grovel and stare at prince ali
and i absolutely love the way he dresses
jasmine has been watching from the balcony of the palace
she humphs it off then leaves
chorus hes got ninety five white persian monkeys
hes got the monkeys lets see the monkeys
and to view them he charges no fee
hes generous so generous hes got slaves hes got servants and flunkies
proud to work for him they bow to his whim love serving him theyre just lousy with loyalty to ali
aladdin throws gold coins out to the people who rush over to collect them
abu and the parade march up the steps of the palace and inside
the sultan runs back inside to the door to the throne room but jafar stands in front of the door
suddenly it bursts open with abu leading the way and crushing jafar and iago behind the door
genie prince ali
ali ababwa heard your princess was a sight lovely to see
and that good people is why he got dolled up and dropped by with sixty elephants llamas galore with his bears and lions a brass band and more with his
forty fakirs his cooks his bakers his birds that warble on key make way for prince ali
more and more fanfare build up until aladdin flies off abus back on magic carpet and flies down to the sultan
jafar slams the door shut
sultan clapping splendid absolutely marvelous
aladdin takes on a deeper voice
your majesty i have journeyed from afar to seek your daughters hand
sultan prince ali ababwa
im delighted to meet you
he rushes over and shakes alis hand
this is my royal vizier jafar
hes delighted too
jafar extremely dryly ecstatic
im afraid prince abooboo aladdin ababwa
you cannot just parade in here uninvited and expect to sultan
by allah this is quite a remarkable device
he tugs at the tassels and they tug his moustache
i dont suppose i might
aladdin why certainly your majesty
he helps the sultan up onto the carpet and he plops down
jafar pins the carpet down on the floor with the staff
jafar sire i must advise against this sultan oh button up jafar
learn to have a little fun
he kicks away the staff and carpet and sultan fly away
iago who was standing on the head of the staff falls down repeatedly bopping the staff with his beak as he descends
sultan and carpet fly high into the ceiling then begin a dive bomb attack flying under abu scaring him
the flight continues in the background while jafar and ali talk in the foreground
jafar just where did you say you were from
aladdin oh much farther than youve traveled im sure
jafar does not
jafar try me
iago lands on the staff
sultan look out polly
they all duck in time as the carpet whizzes centimetres over their heads
carpet returns and the sultan chases iago around the room
iago hey watch it
watch it with the dumb rug
the carpet zooms underneath iago who sighs wipes his brow and crashes into a pillar
he crashes to the floor and his head is circled by miniature sultans on carpets saying have a cracker have a cracker
the real sultan begins his final approach
sultan out of the way im coming in to land
jafar watch this
jafar spectacular your highness
sultan ooh lovely
yes i do seem to have a knack for it
carpet walks over to abu dizzily then collapses
abu catches it
this is a very impressive youth
and a prince as well
whispers to jafar if were lucky you wont have to marry jasmine after all
jafar i dont trust him sire
one thing i pride myself on jafar im an excellent judge of character
iago oh excellent judge yeah sure
jasmine walks in quietly
sultan jasmine will like this one
aladdin and im pretty sure ill like princess jasmine
jafar your highness no
i must intercede on jasmines behalf
jasmine hears this and gets mad
this boy is no different than the others
what makes him think he is worthy of the princess
aladdin your majesty i am prince ali ababwa
he pricks jafars goatee which springs out in all directions
just let her meet me
i will win your daughter
jasmine how dare you
they all look at her surprised
all of you standing around deciding my future
i am not a prize to be won
she storms out
sultan oh dear
dont worry prince ali
just give jasmine time to cool down
jafar i think its time to say good bye to prince abooboo
diss to jasmine on her balcony at night
we tilt down and find aladdin and company in the courtyard
aladdin what am i going to do
jasmine wont even let me talk to her
i should have known i couldnt pull off this stupid prince wish
abu struggles with his elephant paws to open a banana
he squishes it and the banana squirts into his eye
he then tosses the banana peel into a heaping pile of the same
genie to carpet playing chess so move
carpet does knocking a black piece off the board
thats a good move
as rodney dangerfield i cant believe it im losing to a rug
aladdin genie i need help
genie as jack nicholson all right sparky heres the deal
you wanna court the little lady you gotta be a straight shooter do ya follow me
genie back to normal wearing a mortarboard
he points out his words on a blackboard tell her the
aladdin no way
if jasmine found out i was really some crummy street rat shed laugh at me
he puts on his turban which lights up as the genie
genie a woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh
aladdin pulls the chain turning off the light
genie comes out holding the real turban
al all joking aside you really oughtta be yourself
aladdin hey thats the last thing i want to be
okay im gonna go see her
i gotta be smooth cool confident
how do i look
genie sadly like a prince
aladdin flies up to the balcony on carpet
jasmine is on her bed sighing
rajah is by her side
aladdin from a distance princess jasmine
rajah looks up and growls
jasmine whos there
aladdin its me prince ali
ahem then he jumps to his deep voice prince ali ababwa
jasmine i do not want to see you
aladdin no no please princess

rajah growls and advances on him
jafar just leave me alone
aladdin down kitty
over the edge of the balcony carpet is watching with genie below
genie hows our beau doing
carpet cuts his neck with his finger
aladdin good kitty take off
he takes off his turban to brush rajah away
jasmine she looks at him thinking she has seen him before

aladdin quickly replaces his turban uh no no
jasmine you remind me of someone i met in the marketplace
aladdin the marketplace

bee buzzes into his turban aladdin yeah right
aladdin uh youre right
you arent just some prize to be won
he looks disappointed
you should be free to make your own choice
jasmine and rajah look at each other in confusion
ill go now
he steps up on the ledge and drops off
aladdin pokes his head up from over the edge what
jasmine now shes amazed how how are you doing that
she looks over the edge and sees the carpet
aladdin its a magic carpet
jasmine its lovely
carpet takes jasmines hand with a tassel
aladdin you uh you dont want to go for a ride do you
we could get out of the palace see the world
jasmine is it safe
do you trust me
jasmine she looks at him at the saying of that all important line what
aladdin extends his hand the same as before do you trust me
jasmine gets a sly grin on her face yes
she takes his hand and gets up on carpet
it zooms into the sky knocking them both into sitting positions
the music of a whole new world swells
jasmine looks back and sees rajah looking up at her questioningly
she gasps as they fly over the palace wall and into the sky
aladdin i can show you the world shining shimmering splendid
tell me princess now when did you last let your heart decide
carpet zooms down through the town stopping slightly to pick a flower
it gives the flower to aladdin who gives it to jasmine
i can open your eyes take you wonder by wonder over sideways and under on a magic carpet ride carpet does as aladdin sings then zooms into the clouds
a whole new world
a new fantastic point of view no one to tell us no or where to go or say were only dreaming jasmine looks back and watches agrabah disappear from sight
carpet flies in and out of the clouds
jasmine a whole new world a dazzling place i never knew but when im way up here its crystal clear that now im in a whole new world with you
aladdin now im in a whole new world with you
they each catch a small cloud as carpet continues the flight
it then circles a pillar of clouds giving a swirly look to it
jasmine unbelievable sights indescribable feeling soaring tumbling freewheeling through an endless diamond sky they join a flock of birds in the sky
one of them looks terrified and squawks
carpet does somersaults and flips at times putting aladdin and jasmine in free fall but catching them
they then zoom above the clouds where a starry night awaits them
jasmine a whole new world
aladdin dont you dare close your eyes jasmine an hundred thousand things to see aladdin hold your breath it gets better
jasmine im like a shooting star ive come so far i cant go back to where i used to be
they zoom down over a river apparently the nile for beyond the ships sails are the great pyramids
they wave at a worker sculpting the complete nose of the sphinx
he smiles but chisels too much and breaks off the front section of the nose
aladdin a whole new world
jasmine every turn a surprise aladdin with new horizons to pursue jasmine every moment red letter they fly alongside wild horses running
jasmine pets one of them
both ill chase them anywhere theres time to spare let me share this whole new world with you a whole new world thats where well be they fly through greece
where aladdin grabs an apple from a tree and rolls it down his arm to jasmine who is now sure she is dealing with aladdin not prince ali
aladdin a thrilling chase jasmine a wondrous place both for you and me
carpet hovers along over a lake and we see the reflection of the moon in the lake
fireworks burst and we see the couple at a chinese new year celebration sitting on a rooftop
jasmine its all so magical
jasmine she looks at him and decides to burst the bubble its a shame abu had to miss this
he hates fireworks
carpet looks up realizing what is happening
he doesnt really like flying either
and now aladdin realizes it that is
jasmine she pulls off his turban you are the boy from the market
i knew it
why did you lie to me
aladdin jasmine im sorry
jasmine did you think i was stupid
jasmine that i wouldnt figure it out
i mean i hoped you wouldnt
no thats not what i meant
jasmine who are you
tell me the truth
aladdin the truth
he looks at carpet who wave him on giving up hope
the truth is
i sometimes dress as a commoner to escape the pressures of palace life
carpet slumps down in defeat
but i really am a prince
the feather on his turban falls down over his eyes
jasmine why didnt you just tell me
aladdin well you know um
royalty going out into the city in disguise it sounds a little strange dont you think
jasmine not that strange
she flicks up the feather and cuddles with him
carpet puts a tassel under his chin and looks mystified
dissolve to ext
of palace balcony where aladdin and jasmine return
carpet forms a set of steps and she descends
aladdin then descends just below the balcony
jasmine good night my handsome prince
aladdin sleep well princess
they slowly lean forward to kiss but carpet bumps him up and they kiss sooner than expected
she walks away slowly then turns and looks at him
finally she enters her room through the curtain
he falls back onto the carpet who descends to the ground
for the first time in my life things are starting to go right
he looks up at jasmines balcony and four sets of hands grab him
a gag is tied around his mouth
muffled words abu
we see the elephant hanging from a net tied in a tree
guard hold him
shackles are placed on his feet and his hands
another guard ties carpet in a knot around a tree
jafar im afraid youve worn out your welcome prince abooboo
make sure hes never found
a guard hits him in the head and he falls unconscious
cut to a cliff where guards laugh as aladdins body drops into the water
he is conscious now but his feet are tied to a rock
the rock hits the sea bottom then the turban lands and the lamp tumbles out
he sees this and struggles to rub the lamp
however he loses consciousness and falls to the floor
the lamp unsettled by his movement rolls down and rubs against his hands
it shakes and genie emerges with a bath brush rubber duckie and shower cap genie never fails
get in the bath and theres a rub at the lamp
squeaks the duck hello
sees unconscious aladdin al
kid snap out of it
you cant cheat on this one
i cant help you unless you make a wish
you have to say genie i want you to save my life
he grabs aladdin by the shoulders and shakes him
his head goes up then falls
ill take that as a yes
head turns into a siren
turns into a submarine
he babbles in something that sounds like german
on the surface a giant water spout emerges and lands on top of the cliff
aladdin reawakes and coughs the water out of his lungs
dont you scare me like that
aladdin genie i uh i uh
he cant think of how to say it so they just hug each other
genie oh al
im gettin kind of fond of you kid
not that i want to pick out curtains or anything
cut to jasmine in her room humming a whole new world and brushing her hair
the sultan appears in one of the double doors hypnotized
jasmine oh father i just had the most wonderful time

sultan still monotone from the hypnosis you should be jasmine
i have chosen a husband for you
sultan the other door opens and reveals jafar

he brings the staff close to the sultans face
aladdin sees the staff with its glowing eyes

aladdin grabs the staff and smashes it on the floor
jafar flinches and the spell is broken for good
sultan oh oh oh my

he advances the staff sultan what

the trio advances on jafar
jafar your majesty all of this can be explained
iago well thats it were dead forget about it

but jafar sees the lamp in aladdins pocket
he makes a move but is grabbed by guards
sultan arrest jafar at once
jafar this is not done yet boy
jafar pulls a vial from his pocket
aladdin sees this and rushes him but jafar throws the vial to the floor
a large red cloud appears
when it is gone so is jafar
sultan find him search everywhere
aladdin jasmine are you all right
they lean in to kiss but the sultan barges between them
sultan jafar my most trusted counselor plotting against me all this time

aladdin looks concerned at this
cut to int
of jafars chambers
jafar and iago enter

iago starts throwing things out of his cage
jafar smiles broadly
bring the guns the weapons the knives stops and takes out a picture of himself and jafar and how about this picture

jafar starts to laugh wildly
oh boy hes gone nuts
iago flies down to him and knocks on his head
get a grip jafar
jafar grabs him around the neck good grip
jafar prince ali is nothing more than that ragged urchin aladdin
he has the lamp iago
iago why that miserable jafar but you are going to relieve him of it
cut to ext
aladdin is looking at the gardens
they want me to be sultan
genie comes out of lamp genie huzzah
hail the conquering hero
turns into a one man band
he sees aladdin walk away with his head hung
he stops scratches his head comes up with an idea then zooms over to aladdin
he holds up his hands like a director scoping a picture and we look through them
aladdin youve just won the heart of the princess
what are you gonna do next
aladdin looks at him then walks away in sadness to the bed where he falls on it and sighs
genie again is confused then goes to him and pulls out a script labeled aladdin
whispering psst your line is im going to free the genie
genie sure you can
you just go genie i wish you free
he grabs aladdins head and uses him as a mock ventriloquists dummy
aladdin pulls away
aladdin im serious
look im sorry i really am
but they want to make me sultan no
they want to make prince ali sultan
without you im just aladdin
genie al you won
aladdin because of you
the only reason anyone thinks im anything is because of you
what if they find out im not really a prince
quietly what if jasmine finds out
ill lose her
genie i cant keep this up on my own
i cant wish you free
genie sarcastically hey i understand
after all youve lied to everyone else
hey i was beginning to feel left out
now if youll excuse me master
he says the last word in disgust then poofs back into the lamp
abu and carpet are watching from the window
aladdin genie im really sorry
a tongue comes out of the spout and raspberries him
he slams a pillow on top of the lamp
then just stay in there
he looks at abu and carpet
what are you guys looking at
they both leave
look i im sorry
wait abu wait im sorry i didnt wait cmon
what am i doing
genies right i gotta tell jasmine the truth
jasmine from a distance ali oh ali will you come here
aladdin putting on his turban well here goes
he walks into the garden
where are you
we see iago wearing a beak and standing on stilts next to a flamingo in the pond
he is imitating jasmines voice
iago ahem in the menagerie hurry
aladdin im coming
we see aladdin hurry past not noticing the birds
iago laughs then turns back and looks into the face of a flamingo who is panting
iago ya got a problem pinky
he sweeps the birds feet out from under it
iago runs into the palace and finds the lamp under the pillow
boy jafars gonna be happy to see you
stretches his face like jafars and imitates it
good work iago
normal ah go on
jafar no really on a scale of one to ten you are an eleven
normal ah jafar youre too kind
im embarrassed im blushing
he flies away with the lamp
cut to the palace entrance
the sultan is standing on top making an announcement to the people
sultan people of agrabah my daughter has finally chosen a suitor
cut to behind the curtain where jasmine is peeking
aladdin appears at the bottom of the stairs
jasmine ali where have you been
aladdin theres something ive got to tell you
jasmine the whole kingdom has turned out for fathers announcement
but jasmine listen to me please
jasmine good luck
she pushes him out onto the platform with the sultan where he overlooks the entire crowd
aladdin oh boy
far above iago and jafar watch through a window
iago look at them cheering that little pipsqueak
jafar let them cheer
he lifts the lamp and rubs it
genie comes out
genie you know al im getting turns and sees jafar reallyyyyyy i dont think youre him
he descends and consults a playbill
tonight the role of al will be played by a tall dark and sinister ugly man
jafar i am your master now
he throws genie to the ground and puts his foot on genies face
genie i was afraid of that
jafar genie grant me my first wish
i wish to rule on high as sultan
cut to ext where dark clouds circle the castle
the castle shakes
the roof rips off and the sultan and aladdin duck
sultan bless my soul
what is this
what is going on
his turban lifts off his head
when he grabs it his whole body flies up then is stripped of all his clothing except his boxer shorts
the clothing reappears on jafar
jafar heh heh heh
sultan jafar you vile betrayer
iago thats sultan vile betrayer to you
aladdin oh yeah
well well just see about that
pulls off his own turban but finds it empty the lamp
jafar finders keepers abooboo
they both look up and see a gigantic genie lift the palace into the clouds
aladdin whistles and carpet flies up to greet him
they fly up near the genies head
genie sorry kid i got a new master now
he places the palace on top of a mountain
sultan jafar i order you to stop
jafar theres a new order now my order
finally you will bow to me
the sultan bows but jasmine does not
jafar well never bow to you
iago why am i not surprised
jafar if you will not bow before a sultan then you will cower before a sorcerer
to genie genie my second wish i wish to be the most powerful sorcerer in the world
genie extends his finger
aladdin tries to stop him but he cannot and another genie tm brand lightning bolt strikes jafar returning him to his normal look
iago ladies and gentlemen a warm agrabah welcome for sorcerer jafar
jafar now where were we
ah yes abject humiliation
he zaps jasmine and the sultan with his staff and they both bow to him
rajah comes running at him
he zaps rajah and the tiger turns into a kitty cat
oh princess lifts her chin with his staff theres someone im dying to introduce you to
aladdin off camera jafar
get your hands off her
jafar zaps aladdin
carpet flies away
jafar prince ali yes it is he but not as you know him
read my lips and come to grips with reality jafar brings the two of them closer in the air
yes meet a blast from your past whose lies were too good to last say hello to your precious prince ali
jafar zaps ali back to aladdin
iago or should we say aladdin
aladdin jasmine i tried to tell you
jafar so ali turns out to be merely aladdin just a con need i go on
take it from me his personality flaws give me adequate cause to send him packing on a one way trip so his prospects take a terminal dip his assets frozen
the venue chosen is the ends of the earth whoopee
so long iago good bye see ya
jafar ex prince ali
jafar has zapped abu back to normal
he sends the two of them into a tall pillar then launches it like a rocket but not before carpet can get in
f b then we see a snowy wasteland where the pillar crashes and rolls
it finally comes to a stop
aladdin emerges obviously very cold
he looks back at a shivering pile of snow
oh this is all my fault i should have freed the genie when i had the chance
he digs out abu and cradles him inside his vest
are you okay
im sorry abu i made a mess of everything somehow
i gotta go back and set things right
he starts to walk through the snow and he eventuallysteps on a frozen carpet
he looks up and sees carpet is pinned by the pillar
he tugs to try and free carpet
he cant do it so he begins to remove snow from the base of the pillar
abu start digging
finally enough snow has been removed and the pillar begins to roll
aladdin runs away looks back then slides into place
the pillar rolls over him and when it is gone aladdin and abu are left sitting in the patch of snow made by the window of the pillar
he looks up at his turban made out of scared abu
carpet shakes off the snow and rushes over to pick them up
now back to agrabah
we cut back to ext
long shot of agrabah shrouded in red clouds
cut to int
and slow zoom of throne room
iago has the sultan tied up like a marionette and jasmine is chained next to the throne
iago puppet ruler want a cracker
heres your cracker
shove em all right down your throat
here have lots
jafar pulls the chain and jasmine walks up to him holding an apple
jafar leave him alone
iago stops for a second then continues
jafar it pains me to see you reduced to this jasmine
he takes a bite out of the apple she is holding
a beautiful desert bloom such as yourself should be on the arm of the most powerful man in the world
he waves his finger and a crown appears
what do you say my dear
why with you as my queen
she picks up a glass of wine and throws it in his face
jafar ill teach you some respect
she falls back as he raises his hand to slap her
then he stops
genie i have decided to make my final wish
i wish for princess jasmine to fall desperately in love with me
we see aladdin race back into town
genie again as buckley ah master there are a few addendas some quid pro quo jafar dont talk back to me you stupid blue lout
you will do what i order you to do slave
jasmine looks up and sees aladdin in the window motioning her to play along
jasmine she stands and puts the crown on her head
i never realized how incredibly handsome you are
the genies jaw drops
jafar thats better
he pulls the genies jaw up like a shade
now pussycat tell me more about
jasmine youre tall well dressed
jafar walks over to her
aladdin jumps down with abu and genie sees them
al little buddy
genie literally zips his mouth shut then unzips it
al i cant help you i work for senor psychopath now
his head turns into jafars then back
aladdin hey im a street rat remember
he rezips genies mouth
he slides down a pile of coins and hides close to jafar and jasmine
jafars back is to aladdin
jafar go on
jasmine and your beard
she has her arms around him
she pretends to twist with her finger but she is actually motioning for aladdin to come over
he makes his move
iago sees him
iago jaf mmmmmm
abu grabs him and covers his mouth
jafar and the street rat
jasmine what street rat
they are about to kiss when iago manages to knock over a bowl
jafar turns to look but jasmine grabs him back and kisses him
aladdin looks disgusted
iago and abu both look disgusted
jafar that was he sees aladdins reflection in her crown
how many times do i have to kill you boy
he zaps aladdin
jasmine rushes him and he throws her to the ground
aladdin rushes and grabs the staff
aladdin get the lamp
jasmine runs to it
jafar however shakes off aladdin then zaps her into an hourglass
jafar ah ah ah princess your time is up
sand begins to fall from the top onto her
iago oh nice shot jaf he is knocked out by abu
abu rushes for the lamp
jafar dont toy with me
hes zapped into a toy monkey
carpet rushes in
jafar things are unraveling fast now boy
carpet is zapped and unravels
aladdin again rushes for the lamp
get the point
his path is blocked by large swords sticking in the floor
jafar grabs the lamp and laughs hideously
aladdin pulls a sword out of the floor
im just getting warmed up
he breathes a ring of fire around aladdin
aladdin are you afraid to fight me yourself you cowardly snake
jafar a snake am i
perhaps youd like to see how snake like i can be
he smiles broadly and we see a snakes tongue come out from behind his teeth
he then turns into a giant cobra and the ring of fire around aladdin becomes part of the snake encircling aladdin
the snake jafar makes moves on aladdin and on the third try aladdin swings the sword and hits jafar
cut to genie cheerleaders wearing a sweaters
genie rickem rockem rackem rake stick that sword into that snake
jafar you stay out of thissss
genie waving a tiny pennant with a j on it
genie weakly jafar jafar hes our man if he cant do it aladdin uses the distraction to make a break for the hourglass where jasmine is trapped
however jafar sees this and blocks the path
aladdin is thrown away and he loses his sword
aladdin jumps on a large gem and slides across the floor grabbing the sword on his way
he turns a corner but the pursuing snake cannot and the front half of jafar crashes through a wall and hangs outside the palace
aladdin jumps up on the snakes back and stabs it
jafar screams in agony
aladdin again tries to free the princess
aladdin hang on jasmine
he is about to hit the glass with his sword when jafar grabs him
jafar laughs hideously you little fool
you thought you could defeat the most powerful being on earth
iago with genie coming up behind him squeeze him jafar squeeze him like a awk
genie elbows him out of the way jafar without the genie boy youre nothing
aladdin has an idea the genie
the genie has more power than youll ever have
aladdin he gave you your power he can take it away
genie al what are you doing
why are you bringing me into this
aladdin face it jafar youre still just second best
jafar youre right
his power does exceed my own
but not for long
jafar circles around the genie
genie the boy is crazy
hes a little punch drunk
one too many hits with the snake his hand turns into a snake and he hits his head with it
jafar slave i make my third wish
i wish to be an all powerful genie
genie reluctantly all right your wish is my command
way to go al
genie zaps jafar with the last genie tm brand lightning bolt
jafars snake form dissipates and he turns into a genie
we see jasmines raised hand disappear under the sand
aladdin runs over and finally smashes the glass
sand and princess pour out
the absolute power
jasmine to aladdin what have you done
aladdin trust me
a black lamp appears at jafars base
jafar is busy conjuring
jafar the universe is mine to command to control
aladdin not so fast jafar
arent you forgetting something
jafar looks down questioningly you wanted to be a genie you got it
and everything that goes with it
shackles appear on jafars wrists
iago im gettin out of here
come on youre the genie i dont want iago tries to fly away but is sucked in with jafar
aladdin phenomenal cosmic powers
itty bitty living space
genie al you little genius you
abu turns back to normal the carpet re ravels jasmine the sultan and rajah are standing together
rajah jumps up into the arms of the sultan then they are all transformed
the sultan is crushed because of the weight of the new rajah
the palace reappears where it used to be in the city
aladdin is left holding the new lamp
jafar both from inside the lamp
get your blasted beak out of my face
iago oh shut up you moron
jafar dont tell me to shut up
genie allow me
he takes the lamp and goes to the balcony
he is now wearing a baseball cap
he winds up as if to throw the lamp but opens his palm flat and flicks it out into the desert with his finger
ten thousand years in a cave of wonders ought to chill him out
jafar and iago continue to argue as they fade out
jasmine walks over to aladdin
they hold hands but both look sad
aladdin jasmine im sorry i lied to you about being a prince
jasmine i know why you did
aladdin well i guess
genie pokes his head around the corner shocked at what he is hearing
jasmine oh that stupid law
this isnt fair i love you
genie wipes away a tear al no problem
youve still got one wish left
just say the word and youre a prince again
aladdin but genie what about your freedom
genie hey its only an eternity of servitude
this is love
he leans down next to her
al youre not gonna find another girl like her in a million years
believe me i know
aladdin jasmine i do love you but ive got to stop pretending to be something im not
jasmine i understand
they take one final look into each others eyes then aladdin turns to the genie
aladdin genie i wish for your freedom
genie one bona fide prince pedigree coming up
aladdin he holds the lamp up to genie
genie youre free
a transformation scene ensues in which the shackles fall off genies wrist and the lamp falls uselessly to the ground
genie picks it up and looks at it
genie he cant believe it
he hands the lamp to aladdin
quick quick wish for something outrageous
say i want the nile
wish for the nile
aladdin i wish for the nile
genie no way
he bounces around the balcony like a pinball
oh does that feel good
im free at last
im hittin the road
im off to see the world
i he is packing a suitcase but looks down and sees aladdin looking very sad
aladdin genie im im gonna miss you
genie me too al
no matter what anybody says youll always be a prince to me
the sultan steps forward
sultan thats right
youve certainly proven your worth as far as im concerned
its that law thats the problem
sultan well am i sultan or am i sultan
from this day forth the princess shall marry whomever she deems worthy
jasmine she smiles widely and runs into aladdins arms
i choose you aladdin
aladdin ha ha
call me al
they are about to kiss when giant blue hands pull everybody together
genie is decked out in a hawaiian shirt with golf clubs and a goofy hat
genie oh all of ya

mind if i kiss the monkey
he kisses abu
well i cant do any more damage around this popsicle stand
im outta here
bye bye you two crazy lovebirds
hey rugman ciao
no im mythology
no i dont care what i am im free
the genie flies up into the blue sky leaving a trail of sparkles behind him
they cut a jump cut to make matters worse to fireworks exploding over a nightscape
we tilt down and see aladdin and jasmine flying on carpet
aladdin a whole new world jasmine a whole new life both with off camera chorus for you and me
mens chorus a whole new world
they fly off into the moonlight and after they have disappeared the moon turns and reveals the genies laughing face
suddenly the film is grabbed off the projector the genie lifts it up and looks at the audience
genie made ya look
drops the film back to normal with the normal moon
fade to black
