camera tracks eye level around the table where an fbi agent mid s black suit sits across from lisa janusch cheerleader from the witness side pretty in a man made
way bitchy in a b squad cheerleader way
other black suited agents stand in the room
cheerleader mug shots cover the table
and testifying in such a case is a serious matter
should you decide your testimony would jeopardize your personal safety

she smiles sweetly to the agent then pushes dianes mug shot toward him
dropping smile lets start with the one who thinks her shit dont stink
foggy heart shaped mirror

a hand enters frame and wipes clear the mirror revealing diane pregnant cheerleader in opening not pregnant now

pompoms snap to waist okay
pompoms snap to thighs and the cheer begins
diane is effortless as she glides jumps and smiles through it clearly better than lisa

lisa pushes the rest of the mug shots toward the fbi agent
now the squad as a whole
theyre closer than carolina cousins
some people say theyre like lezbos or something
but thats mostly just the yag offs in band
five pair of legs with matching anklets and white keds dangle from the stalls
truth is theyre so close they all get their monthly visit from aunt rose at the same time
a hand reaches under the first stall passing a box of tampons to the next stall and so on down the line
first theres hannah wold
hannah wold a large pretty girl in uniform exits and crosses to the mirror
shes their base
strong as an ox
shes like this uber christian doesnt say much

number one not a natural blonde
she repeats for the other breast then pulls her sweater down
ive been in the locker room and seen south of the border

cleo lifts the back of her skirt revealing conan obriens face silkscreened on her underpants thought bubble above his head reads friday

hill whips out a shotgun and blows his ass to kingdom come
we see this still in mrs
jury said because the majority of women in lincoln county having babies dont bring a shotgun it counted as premeditation
she got life without parole so kansas lives with her grandparents
the next stall door opens and lucy cute smart very tidy exits suddenly stopping to look down
then theres lucy
she takes out a white out bottle and touches a spot on her already white keds
then touches a spot on the other shoe
geek extraordinaire a walking left brain
shes supposed to have this genius i
she then starts an obsessional frenzy of whiting out spots all over her keds
diane exits the final stall and takes away lucys white out
truth is shes an obsessive compulsive little freak
hands in ladies
squad joins diane in a circle putting their hands over her hand a la madonna backstage
today were going to cheer loud jump high and look pretty because in one beat all swing right arms over head landing with a smack on the ass of the
girl to their right
now lets get going because nobody ever got ahead by sitting on their behind
as all run out we principal smith a man who burned out long ago stands behind a microphone on a small stage as hes done for years
the lincoln high fightin log mascot looks like an angry tootsie roll with legs and overly muscular arms stands beside him pantomiming everything he says
students fill bleachers on either side
the school year started off like normal
principal smith gave his pep talk reading from a list and if you are approached to buy drugs let someone you trust know
if you are thinking of harming yourself or others let someone know
if it burns when you urinate have milky seepage or are being touched by an uncle let someone know
mascot looks at him tries to pantomime
the a squad performed
gym lights go dark
and brass band start rock roll part ii by gary glitter
the spotlight races around the gym before it hits center court
the a squad springs to their feet for an amazing cheer dance strong sexy acrobatic non traditional
now i know its my duty to give you all the facts so i have to say that their cheer blew like a bulimic after christmas dinner
their blatant disregard for national high school cheerleading association rules made me sick
basket toss flips and wolf wall pyramids over two people high are strictly prohibited
i made a complete report and sent it in
outside the gym doors
and finally the football team was introduced
transferring from truman high the new star quarter back of our mighty fightin logs
thats when jack and diane met
nobody saw it coming
camera turns players head butt and high five camera jack as he starts through the door looking around gym
slow motion freeze frame as the spotlight hits camera jack
especially not jack
its loud and confusing
through it we see the a squad running and doing back flips toward camera jack
as the squad nears camera jack suddenly dianes ked clad foot comes into frame and smashes into camera jack
he fell for her hard
diane hovers over camera jack apologizing looking angelic
a squad surrounds her
suddenly a frantic mascot breaks through tips his log head back its bruce from try outs mouthing noooooo
he pulls camera jack mascot bruce as he drags his prize quarterback out of the gym
jack and dianes eyes never separate
jack was fine oh man was he fine
it was like he was a bar of chocolate and the whole school was on the rag everyone wanted a piece of him
jack bart lett
jack bar t lett
she continues as we pull back to reveal were its an early s dream
the squad sits on their sleeping bags in a circle on the floor
theyre painting nails giving henna tattoos streaking hair etc
hannah has a ouija board in front of her hands resting on the message indicator
diane has her eyes closed
ja ck b ar t le tt
is jack bartlett interested in me
nervous i im sorry can someone else please run the ouija board
its creepy its wrong and it goes against the teachings of my lord and savior jesus christ
hannah in order to get real answers from the netherworld youve gotta have a christian virgin run the board

looking down well technically i dont think im a virgin anymore
this summer at church camp

homecoming king and queen candidates
a row of student candidates including jack diane and lisa sit behind a butch girl at the podium
look ill be honest with you
most of us realized we didnt have a whores chance in heaven with jack the day of candidate speeches
as the butch girl concludes her speech she holds a sign over her head which reads h a way of life
a geeky guy stands at the podium
as the a
club candidate i think for the first time in fifty years we should say nervous no to a football player as king
two high pitched male voices cheer o
vote brains over braun
a football flies into frame hitting geeky guy on the jack stands at the podium unable to speak because the crowd is cheering
hes handsome as hell sweet and genuine

diane stares at him
lisa looks pissed
the school suddenly erupts with cheers
jack turns to diane
she runs up to the podium
they hug and kiss
they were like friggin barbie and ken but without the pink remote control corvette
overnight people were going like average girl faces camera mouthing oh theyre the perfect couple
another average girl faces camera mouthing theyre so cuuuuuuuuute
geeky guy sits alone typing frantically at his computer stopping occasionally to push up his glasses
im sure it gave the internet whacks something to talk about besides agent scully and their most recent wet dream
jack and diane are still in a love lock
now im not one to gossip but i think jack and diane got so close so fast because they discovered how much they both loved
janitorial closet door
an excited diane and jack meet in front of it kiss and roll into the closet
a climbing rope hangs in the middle of the shot
suddenly a disheveled jack slides down
a beat later diane follows
they kiss and part ways dropping hands at the last minute
red faced jack and diane peek out look to see theyre alone kiss good bye then head off in opposite directions
door closes to reveal a sign principal smith
its cold and loud
starting on his own yard line jack takes the hike looks left right pumps once twice nothing
he bursts through the line dodging weaving leaping over his opponents
holding their breath pompons at the ready
mascot runs past them pantomiming nervous to the crowd by biting his nails and knocking his knees
as he reaches the line of scrimmage
theres one defender left
jack fakes left right takes the tackle but manages to roll out of it
he could go all the
theyre going wild
running along the sideline diane leading the way
he looks right sees diane and mouths i love you
diane mouths i love you
jack makes the touchdown spikes the ball and starts a slow run toward us arms outstretched
we run toward him in slow motion
suddenly a wall of players enter frame and tackles him in celebration
now right about heres where the real shit started to hit the fan

suddenly jacks mom throws her head back and lets out a blood curdling pull back to reveal were so when your dad said i never want to see your f
in faces again
do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up
i dont know
and what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table

of his own
getting an idea cradling his face jack do you know what i see here
spit from your dad
wiping his hair i see a flower
and yknow even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt

as they move in for a kiss we jack and diane are on stage wearing crowns and large velvet robes they turn and wave
they appear to be floating on a sea of balloons
five pair of legs with high heels dangle from the stalls
weve seen this shot before
music from the dance presses through the walls
a hand reaches under the first stall passing a box of tampons to the next stall
diane mustve told her squad that night
box of tampons continues down the line until the last stall
dianes hand comes down and pushes the tampons back
in last stall no thanks dont need one
first stall door files open followed by the second third it sticks kansas climbs over and fourth
cleo exits fixing her gel breast
the squad surrounds dianes stall door
she finally exits

jack and diane sit in front of an older loan officers desk

diane makes a dramatic exit taking a handful of m ms from her desk
the squad previously unidentified lounging in the central bank of couches follows her
watching proudly a smiling jack and diane as they look lovingly into each others eyes
its a little more than we wanted to spend but well take it

the only window looks out on a brick wall
the apartment manager a grungy tommy lee type paces

the social retards look at each other excited
a worried diane now showing slightly under all black warm ups is writing on her notepad as she walks down an aisle
suddenly in the b
cross aisle an ecstatic jack in video barn uniform whizzes past riding his cart
arms out at his sides
im on top of the world
seeing diane he tries to stop but cant and continues past
a second later he scrambles back and rides up to her tossing more boxes into the already full cart
holding box of cookies hey di if we have a girl we should dress her like little debbie
jack pulls alongside diane and kisses her
she notices the full cart
itll cost a fortune
jack sweetie im only eating for two
positively giddy but di all this food reminds me of how much i want to teach our baby
he tosses more cereal in the cart
diane looks at her notepad then starts to return items to the shelves without like cocoa puffs
shreds the roof of your mouth
i mean you hear tricks are for kids
and you think im a kid i guess theyre for me
but your baby brains got no idea that fruit loops are like a million times better

jack i think i should get a job
rubbing her belly but we agreed your job is running the baby machine
i know but that was before
i almost forgot gas for the baby machine

he kisses her again and runs off
diane watches him the love in her eyes quickly turns back to worry and she starts to put everything back on the shelves cookies cereal chips ice cream oh that
struggle but it goes
diane emerges with an almost empty cart
just milk peanut butter bread and a large roast are all that remain
diane turns to see jack a couple aisles over holding out a in a funny voice hello im the little professor
wouldnt it be cute if ours looked like this
a woman rushes over and angrily grabs her kid back from jack punches him and storms off
diane rushes in line ditching the roast in a gum rack beside the check out
as she struggles with it she notices a woman at the lincoln savings and loans branch inside the safeway at the end of the check out aisles putting out a
help wanted sign
jack drives as diane devours a king size snickers bar
i never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch
baby we are living the great american dream

unseen by jack diane slips her hand out the partially open window releasing a page from her notepad
on the blowing list as the mustang drives on mouth full if you reach for the stars youre bound to get mm jack pull over
he pulls over
why do they call it morning sickness
in the unfocused b
diane opens her door and crawls out about to toss her cookies
in the f
the list settles on the road from the beautiful mind of diane is a pre printed on the top
diane wrote monthly income column which totals
her monthly bills column totals
one month left is scribbled at the bottom
in the seafood case
the butchers hand comes in takes it out and flops it on the scale
oscillating fan behind him
follow the smell as it drifts from the counter over to diane working in the bank branch
she sniffs sniffs again then suddenly gags and goes down behind the counter
jacks hand comes into frame tracing it against the wall
pull back as diane steps away
we see two lines labelled august and september on the wall
they smile and kiss
the squad in uniform walks toward camera in a line across the hall looking cool as hell
squad walks away
an additional piece of fabric has been added to the back of dianes skirt
jack and diane open the front door
the building manager pushes in a big screen tv

diane turns to the crowd
jacks heckler must die
yelling to heckler run you bastard run
dianes off scaling the bleachers

a beat up jack helmet under arm walks with his arms around diane whos icing her fist

diane at the service window smiles as she helps a customer then drops her pen behind the counter mouthing ooops one moment

she takes a huge bite then pops up smiling mouth full
squad is looking over different pregnancy books

a larger piece of fabric has been added to the back of dianes skirt
diane eating snickers sits in the bean bag chair in front of the big screen tv
jack stands beside it holding a video animal births

jacks hand comes into frame tracing it
ice cream drips on it
jack licks it off as we pull back to see a very tired diane holding a pint of ice cream using a snickers as a spoon
four lines labelled august september october and november on the wall
jack gives diane a tired peck on the cheek as she continues to eat
as they turn flash cards in unison to read logs are going nuts
they notice diane isnt there
shes eating a vendors box
they run over to her
running for a touchdown a la his homecoming run
this time hes exhausted and the competition is gaining
everything grinds to a slo mo crawl as jack makes a heroic leap for the touchdown
with his spare hand he attempts to smother a huge yawn as opposing players come flying at him from both sides
continuation of pervious shot as jack lands on the bed completing the touchdown
diane falls across the frame from the opposite side
theyre asleep by the time they hit the bed still in cheerleading and football uniforms
jack holds a large state trophy diane holds a half eaten snickers
okay so they won state b
the best part was diane was really starting to look like shit
dianes face smashed against a side glass panel as she sleeps

lisa looks around then walks over and kicks the chair out from under jacks head sending him crashing to the floor
oh my g d are you okay
she immediately kneels beside him placing his aching head in her lap smothering him in her breasts
groggily reaching up diane
lisa stands dropping him from her lap
its pitch black

squad sits in a cleared space in front of the big tv painting nails reading magazines etc
did you guys hear that in china or one a those places that makes the really cheap silk shoes and kids are super smart that as a reward for good
grades mothers get their kids hookers to blow em
all stop and look at her

squad is watching point break on tv bank robbery about to start
diane eats snickers
oh my g d i read about this
its called a pregnancy insanity
quick she needs a sitz bath putting down her snickers look i might be moody
i might be gassy
but i am perfectly sane
think about it
in school they tell us dreams can come true
squad ad libs agreement not knowing where this is going
but they dont tell us how
well thanks to keanu i figured it out
money makes your dreams come true
squad ad libs their concern for her mental health
old spirit returning listen kansas i know you dream of springing your mom some day
stop youre gonna make me cry
and if the o
trial taught us anything it taught us that in america you can cut off someones head and still be found innocent if you have enough money
your mom only shot a guy
kansas smiles at the thought
now cleo i know you dream of an all leather apartment with conan i heard the school shrink telling a lunch lady
cleo blushes and smiles guiltily at the thought
and hannah you could give your share to your church or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids sally struthers advertises
or i could get my own horse
look you guys i just want to provide a future for my baby
i know my bank branch like the back of my puffy little hand
i could open that safe in my sleep
squad reacts with shock did she just say that
i mean it
this is the closest thing to a goddamn family that ive ever had
if one of us needs something we all do
this is crazy
im in too
kansas is right
were like sisters were closer than sisters
and you dont turn your back on family
cmon luce people do it in the movies all the time
and they get caught
so all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes
and you know real cops arent half as smart as keanu
ive got a scholarship to harvard hanging over my head
i wont risk it
sotto to kansas conan went to harvard
sotto shut up
lucy do you know for sure youre going to get that scholarship
if you dont can you still afford to go to harvard
i dont know
so then this isnt crazy
its a sure bet
squad ad libs their encouragement
i guess were in this together
they jump around thrilled
but we have to make a smart plan
of course of course
squad puts their hands in
we all have to cross our hearts hope to die stick a dirty needle in my eye that well never tell jack
we all know he cant lie thats why hes going to be such a great senator
as the squad goes through their cheerleaders kick ass
it looks just like dianes basement
cleo sits on the couch eating from a bag of microwave popcorn
the video box for reservoir dogs plays in the tiny picture in picture
the room is neatly ordered
lucy sits at her computer dvd case of heat sits beside her monitor
shes taking copious notes
her mom enters with milk and cookies
lucy stands concealing her monitor
her mom sets down the cookies and kisses lucys good night before she exits
relieved lucy sits at her computer again
its a sparse room filled with religious icons
hannah nervously places a video into the vcr above the tv then sits on the couch
she smiles about to push play on the remote when her stern uber christian parents enter and take a seat on either side of her
her look turns to fear as her father takes the remote and hits play
camera tracks down the hallway passing groups of kids as they talk beside their lockers
we pass the geeky guy from candidate speeches and his two friends
i feel utterly abandoned in a place that values physical prowess over mental acuity
i cant wait for all this to change once we get in the real world
continue tracking past lisa and the b squad
i totally marry prince william even if he was gay
i mean in england all guys are kinda gay anyway
even cigarettes are fags over there
b squad ad libs agreement as we continue to the a squad around dianes locker
he slices off the guys ear and i mean you see everything the bloody pink hole where the cleo ive already thrown up twice today could you please get to
any relevant part of the movie
they yknow uh
they had nicknames
squad sits at their lunch table in this large open room
only diane eats from all the trays
lucy walks around the table handing out stapled packets
page one is a plot summary of heat
two has my character summaries
three is my overall critique and on four through ten youll find my nexus search of all prior analysis of this film
all stare at her
she stops starts to pick up the packets
uh in summation no part of heat is really applicable to a grocery store bank branch robbery
what the heck is going on here
all turn to see jack followed by football players and the video barn geeks
uh jack look i can explain
diane theres no excuse for not taking your pre natal vitamins
now if you guys were really friends youd remind her to take these
he smiles gives diane her vitamins and kisses her head before exiting to the jock table
would you just say my name
the squad in uniform sits along the wall
pregnant couples fill the rest of the room
so while its a laugh riot for the whole family and tim conway is just about as funny as they come especially when he goes
wait a minute
you watched the apple fucking dumpling gang
im only allowed g movies
losing it am i the only one who cares about this
at least i watched dog day afternoon
excuse me could you please keep your voice down
were not introducing anger into the womb
snapping back well howd you like me to introduce my foot into your ass
lowering her voice im sorry diane but im not gonna watch my dreams fade away cause the virgin mary here thinks shes gonna get ideas from kiddie movies those of
us who have parents know that they have rules because they care

kansas and hannah go at it the girl fight is on
diane cleo and lucy try to pull them apart ad libbing stop
and knock it off
a nurse enters from the other side of the room
diane pushes her way through the fight forcing a smile
a disheveled squad enters to find diane on the exam table crying
her sweater is pulled up pregnant belly exposed
an ultrasound machine and monitor is on beside her
di were sorry
i cant take the fighting the back stabbing the open hostility
were not acting like cheerleaders were acting like a bunch of sorority girls
the squad rushes to a sobbing diane embarrassed by their behavior and what its done to diane
through tears its all my fault
im sorry i ever started this
di its not your fault
we all wanted to do this for you
squad ad libs agreement
cleo picks up the ultra sound hand piece beside diane and starts fiddling with it
look maybe i can watch a pg movie
ill just say im counting dirty words for sunday school
thats okay hannah
it was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies
sex you can learn from movies
theres no way
cleo sets the hand piece on dianes belly
the squad stares in wide eyed wonder at the monitor for the first time they see dianes baby
diane doesnt notice
besides tv land had a little house on the prairie marathon and the ingalls made baby carries bed in a dresser drawer
i guess i can just do that
diane sees the squad staring and turns to the monitor
oh my g d
she sees her baby moving and gently touches her belly with both hands
its all very real
suddenly the baby shirts forward and we see a second babys head
babys got two heads

squad stands frozen looking up at this cinder block shack
a bad hand painted sign on top has arnold schwarzenegger whoever gets out alive have the authorities to check in the crawl space

the squad runs out and gets into hannahs station wagon

slide of vagina
the vagina forming the lower portion of the birth canal will normally expand its folded walls to allow for the birth process
suddenly diane and the squad walk across the screen
