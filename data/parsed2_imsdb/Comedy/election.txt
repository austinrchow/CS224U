election by alexander payne andjim taylor b
b if window
href b b election by alexander payne jim taylor third draft july based on the novels by tom perotta the school stretches out before us slumbering in the overcast morning
along the front sidewalk a lone janitor trundles a garbage bin filled with overstuffed hefty bags
a weathered ford escort pulls into the empty parking lot and comes to a stop near the athletic field
none of this would have happened if mr
mcallister hadnt meddled the way he did
he should have just accepted things as they are instead of trying to interfere with destiny
you see you cant interfere with destiny
thats why its destiny
and if you try to interfere the same things going to happen anyway and youll just suffer
jim mcallister a teacher in his mid to late thirties emerges from the car in running clothes and carrying a briefcase gym bag and coffee mug
on his way to the field he crosses paths with the janitor
morning lowell lowell nods hoists a bag and tosses it into a dumpster
jim circles the track sweating and panting
on the ground jim does sit ups twenty one
he collapses onto his back
his head rolls to one side and he glances past the fence at where a second car is just arriving
jim watches as tracy flick a junior and her mother get out
the mother helps remove a card table and a big plastic sack from the trunk before tracy heads toward the school
distant good luck
jim turns his gaze toward the sky closes his eyes sighs
naked in the showers jim pumps liquid soap from the wall mounted metal dispenser
the legs of a card table as tracy spreads them open and locks them into place
sticks of gum from a plen t pack are emptied into a fishbowl scotch tape is wrapped around the end of a pen to attach a piece of string jim
adjusts the knot of his tie notices a little shaving cream in his ear
four clipboards with pens and lined sheets of paper are being placed in a row like little soldiers
the top of every sheet reads tracy flick for president official nomination signatures
jim tries to place his lunch inside but the shelves are too crammed with old take out containers
he opens one and smells it
disgusted he drags a garbage can over and begins throwing things away
lowell appears in the doorway wheeling his squeaky maintenance cart and watches jim conduct his purge as a chinese food box misses the can and rolls on the floor
tracy is seated behind her card table strategically placed near the schools main entrance
a sign taped to the wall behind her reads tracy for prez
sign up for tomorrow today
she checks her watch readies herself
jim walks around the corner whistling vaguely
good morning mr
not wasting any time are you tracy
chirping you know what they say about the early bird
yes i do
an awkward moment passes between them
well good luck there tracy thanks mr
as jim turns and walks away tracy watches him
he stops and picks up some litter tosses it in a nearby garbage can
no matter what he says mr
mcallister had it out for me from the start
oh sure he was all smiles and good wishes and everything but underneath he was just as unfair and petty as anybody else
alone in his room jim studies the omaha world herald hell probably tell you how committed he was to teaching and democracy and integrity and all
dont be fooled
after laying the paper down to circle an article jim leans back in his chair and momentarily loses himself in thought
its hard to remember how the whole thing started the whole election mess
what i do remember is that i loved my job
i was a teacher an educator and i couldnt imagine doing anything else
suddenly a voice hey mr
jim glances out the window and sees a kid paul metzler pointing at him
paul walks with a limp
behind him other students approach the school
get back to work
jim enjoys the affectionate joshing and gives the kid a wave
he returns to his newspaper a contented man
the students knew it wasnt just a job for me
jim sits in the bleachers clapping his hands over his head
lets hold em back
i got involved
and i cared
jim is dressed as a western villain and his black hat reads lincoln south
with a menacing grimace he approaches a group of football players at a poker table
and i think i made a difference
jim has a comforting hand of the shoulder of a crying girl i knew i touched the students lives during their difficult young adult years and i took that responsibility
jim trots up the stairs to receive a plaque
in the twelve years i taught u
history civics and current events at millard i was voted teacher of the year three times a school record
mcallister reads aloud from the newspaper as he paces in front of his class of high school juniors tracy flick among them
the seats are arranged in a semi circle
standing in front of a room full of young people trying to make them think thats how i wanted to spend the rest of my life jim slaps the newspaper
for emphasis and addresses the class so would this be an ethical situation or a moral situation
whats the difference between ethics and morals anyway
tracy shoots her hand into the air
jim notices but keeps looking around
anybody other hands rise tentatively derek uh ethics is like when you uh do what society tells you is right and morals are like uh
youre on the right track who can help him out
morals are when
tracys hand goes higher
morals are like lessons you know like the moral of a story its what you learn from a story or a fable or something
or a life experience
thats more like urn
ethics is how you use the morals
that you learn from a story
jim weighs the answer tries to be encouraging
but were still missing something key here
what are we missing
hand still raised i know
freeze frame on tracy her hand lowering her mouth agape
ive never met anyone quite like tracy flick
jim sits to one side monitoring the student council meeting about to convene
a younger tracy enters briskly and unlike her casual teen comrades has made an attempt to dress for success
she takes a seat right up front and opens her backpack
after preparing her notepad and pen tracy puts a microcassette recorder on the table in front of her and pushes record
she first showed up in my life as a freshman delegate in student council
id seen a lot of ambitious students come and go over the years but i could tell right away tracy flick was different
jim observes tracy trying to size her up
on tracy putting all her little things in order finally folding her hands to wait
it wasnt long before everyone knew who tracy flick was
she made sure of that
her drive was astonishing
insert hillard high yearbook it fans open to the index
pan down to tracys name followed by countless page references some people say im an overachiever but i think theyre just jealous
a page number turns bold and the other numbers drop away suddenly we are on that page and we pan to a headline spanish club says oh la
pan to the group shot and zoom in on tracy smiling in a big sombrero
my mom always tells me im different you know special
and if you look at all the things ive accomplished so far i think youd have to agree
we see tracy on other pages too yearbook staff goes for it
junior achievers put on the dog
student council meets the challenge oklahomas a hit
here i am in oklahoma
the still of tracy in oklahoma suddenly comes to life
on stage tracy wears a cowgirl outfit and hams it up with exaggerated gestures
off key im just a girl who cant say no
its the closed circuit school news broadcast
tracy is delivering a stand up report from the crowded cafeteria
her dress and makeup are an obvious if lame emulation of a professional newswoman
and here i am on kmhs our student run tv station
thats why principal hendricks made the controversial announcement that the littering must stop
tracy flick reporting
a student council meeting is underway led by the president larry fouch
a girl ashley is speaking
jim observes from the side
but it was in sga the student government association where i made my biggest mark
i never missed a meeting and i volunteered for every committee as long as i could lead it
before ashley can finish tracy stands up i agree with ashley
we should rent the barrels at least a day beforehand
what happened last time was a travesty i mean we were trying to quiet her yeah no i know tracy
thats why were look can we just take a vote on this
back to tracy still frozen mid sentence waiting to finish her answer
now at the end of her junior year tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body
and so far she was running unopposed
the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a
theres one more thing about tracy i think you should know
close on dave novotny another teacher in his mid thirties her pussy gets so wet you cant believe it
dave is leaning across his desk to speak with jim at an adjacent work area
they eat sack lunches
a few months before the election shed had an affair with my best friend dave novotny
dont tell me that
i dont want to know that
everything just gets soaked
jims basement day dun dun dun
dun dun dun jim and dave are playing the opening notes of foxy lady through cheap distorting amps
jim plays bass
dave plays guitar and sings into a microphone
as in not good
the basement is typical of a midwest middle class young couple half storage and laundry half makeshift roc room
dave came to millard the year after i did and we hit it off right away
we backed each other up in teachers meetings and shared an interest in s music and micro breweries
close on dave really getting into it playing to an unseen stadium
behind him jim is very careful with his chords
you could tell dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place and that could get a little irritating
sometimes but basically he was a real good guy
you know youre a cute little heartbreaker
you know youre a sweet little love maker
camera drifts toward the stairs leading up
camera drifts from the open basement stairway door and toward diane mcallister and sherry novotny seated at the kitchen table
they are fussing over little six month old darryl novotny in his highchair
our wives became best friends too
and when dave and sherrys son darryl was born they asked us to be godparents
at a particularly grating note from downstairs diane gets up and closes the basement door
an isosceles triangle is being drawn on the blackboard and bisected
pull out to reveal dave explaining
the class is taking notes and we zero in on a younger tracy
you probably think the worst that mr
novotny was just taking advantage of one of his students but it wasnt like that at all
our relationship was based on mutual respect and admiration
i mean during my sophomore year in geometry it was strictly professional between us i mean nothing
godfathers pizza night the parking lot the neon lights the promise of good times
it wasnt until junior year when we worked together on the yearbook that things got serious
godfathers pizza night dave and tracy are at a booth along with six other students
and the others shift positions
others continue to disappear in the same way until only dave and tracy remain
one night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline
eventually dave and i were left alone and we got to talking not like teacher and student but like two adults
you know tracy
i dont know how to say this but
daves finger traces the rim of his frosty root beer mug
well i notice you dont seem to have any close friends at millard
you seem to be kind of a loner
no im not
im just really busy
i know its not by choice
i just mean well being the kind of person you are it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to
what do you mean
what kind of person am i
what kind of person
dave looks directly into her eyes
tracy ive been watching you for going on two years now and i think you are one of the most talented hard working sensitive attractive brilliant students no human beings
i have ever met
i mean youre the real thing
embarrassed low thank you
and i know sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness and that price is loneliness
tracy nods in quiet recognition
i dont know
maybe im wrong
but it seems like you might need a friend
a door with cloudy glass and a stenciled sign yearbook office
dissolve through the door and travel through an empty room to discover another door with a sign that reads darkroom
since i grew up without a dad you might assume psychologically i was looking for a father figure
dissolve through the darkroom door to dave and tracy bathed in red light
tracy is sitting on daves lap as they make out hungrily
but that had nothing to do with it at all
it was just that dave was so strong and made me feel so safe and protected
tracy sits in the passenger seat
it was the first time somebody ever saw the real me the me that nobody else knows
looking around here get down
dave wheels his car into the open garage
the automatic door closes behind him
dave stands up from his squat at the stereo and the sexy sounds of sade set the mood
tracy is seated awkwardly at one end of the sofa a diet dr
pepper in one hand
dave walks slowly toward her a sexy knowing look in his eye
the music is sexy
tracy is sexy
keeping his eyes locked on tracys he takes the pop can from her hand and takes a sip himself
dave and tracy walk up the stairs and down the hall
dave enters the bedroom first while tracy pauses in the hall
his arm reaches out and pulls her inside
in quick tight cuts we see dave and tracy disrobing tracys head and naked shoulders lay themselves on daves pillow
she looks toward the foot of the bed at dave unable to believe his eyes
he looks at naked tracy up and down up and down his breath quickening
sade wafts up the stairs
look at you
he descends out of frame
when i think back on my relationship with mr
novotny what i miss most
is our talks
jim is riveted by daves story he is both horrified and titillated you did it at your house
your own house
i know it all seems crazy and maybe it did start out you know for the
for the sex and the danger
but now its different
jim what im trying to tell you is that tracy and i are totally totally in love
yeah its serious
i mean she inspires me in ways sherry never has
she even wants to read my novel
but you havent written your novel
thats the whole point
its all in my head its right here
i just got to get it out there
tracy wants me to write it so she can read it
dave im just saying this as your friend
what youre doing is really really wrong and youve got to stop
dave draws a heavy sigh and buries his head in his hands perhaps jim has reached him
youre not just jealous are you
i mean we both used to talk about her exploding that was just talk
what are you nuts
we talk about girls all the time but it doesnt mean anything
i would never
i mean i take very seriously our strict moral code
the line youve crossed is
its illegal and its immoral
i dont need a lecture on ethics jim okay
i know what im not talking about ethics
im talking about morals
peek a boo
sherry comes down the basement stairs with darryl in her arms
to jim whispering look i appreciate your concern
i really do
but like i said i got it under control
as sherry approaches them dave rises to take darryl the perfect father hug tickle kiss
i guess i dont have to tell you how all this turned out
close on dave slumped in a chair
he is lost in agony all he can do is look down and draw short gasping breaths
principal walt hendricks is at his desk examining a little booklet
sits on the vinyl sofa
close on the small makeshift booklet whose cover reads theres a place for us in overdone fancy cursive
the second page shows a cutout from a travel magazine of a swanky beachfront hotel
one room has been circled with the words you and me written next to it
below a time and place for us
we hear walt clearing his throat swallowing
the third page has glued to it a postcard showing a couple hand in hand on the beach at sunset and reading maui is for lovers
below take my hand and well soon be there
the last page has a cutout of a bouquet of flowers
it reads tracy see you in paradise
love your teacher david
i really really need you now
the booklet is lowered
tracys mom she doesnt understand
no id say she doesnt
i dont think ive ever seen a mother quite so upset
were all very very lucky she doesnt want this public
dave looks at jim for help
jim looks away
daves breaths grow more convulsive
finally but were in love dave
dave look at me dave looks slowly up
i want you to get some help
sherry cradles darryl while dave grovels at her feet
after dave got fired sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce
are you fucking kidding me
dave follows sherry as she takes the baby into their bedroom and slams the door in daves face
dave pounds on the door eventually sinking to his knees and crying
sherry sherry sheerrry
he ended up moving back to milwaukee to live with his parents
i havent heard from him in a long time
i warned him
tracy still frozen thaws out
maybe now she can finish certain time in history and ringgggg maybe not
at the bell students instantly shut their textbooks and collect their things
well pick up here next time tracy is miffed as she puts her things away slam stuff zip
she slings her backpack over her shoulder and heads toward the door
she looks back at mr
mcallister who himself now freezes as he talks to a couple of students now that i have more life experience i feel sorry for mr
close up frozen details of jims appearance his slightly frayed collar and bad tie the heels of his old docksiders worn down at irritating angles the faded impression his too
big wallet has made in his khakis his growing bald spot his ear hairs
i mean anyone whos stuck in the same little room saying the exact same things year after year for his whole life wearing the same stupid clothes while his students
go on to good colleges and move to big cities and do great things and make loads of money has got to be at least a little jealous
its like my room says the weak always try to sabotage the strong
tracy turns and walks out the door
close on a smiling little tracy in a sears style portrait
pan across a wall full of other framed photos of tracy accepting awards dancing in a recital poised to dive at a swim meet
one thing thats important to know about me is that im an only child
so my mom is really devoted to me and i love her so much
she wants me to do all the things she wanted to do in life but couldnt
tracys mother barbara flick finishes a letter and puts it in an envelope
see mom used to be a stewardess for northwest and now works as a para legal
she likes to write letters to successful women like janet reno and elizabeth dole and ask them how they got to be where they are and what advice do they
have for me tracy her daughter
close on barbaras tongue as the envelope flap slides across it
a politicians smile plastered to her face tracy is at her card table vigorously gathering signatures
nine times out of ten they say you have to hold on to your dreams no matter what
the pressures women face mean you have to work twice as hard and you cant let anything or anyone stand in your way
a shabbily dressed burnout doug schenken walks past and grabs a huge handful of gum
one per person
put those back i john just keeps on walking away and his two buddies take great delight in his nimble witted quick retort
eat me while other students sit in groups around her tracy sits apart at her own table concentrated and alone
she is writing little numbers by her signatures
but you know winning isnt everything
if you play fair and follow all the rules thoroughly youll always come out ahead
win or lose ethical conduct is the most important thing
just ask mr
wait up jim his tie loose and his sleeves rolled up looks up from unlocking his car
tracy runs toward him holding out a term paper folder
i got all my signatures
one hundred and fifty eight way more than i need
hey thats super here they are
you can put those in my box
ill look at them tomorrow
could you approve them now
id like to kick off my campaign right away you know in the morning
resigned right he cursorily flips through the bound pages and offers them back to tracy
looks good to me
arent you supposed to keep them
no thats fine i thought you were supposed to keep them
sure jim throws his briefcase and tracys folder into the backseat
thanks for everything
tracy stays put as jim climbs in shuts the door and fastens his seat belt
cheery awkward i cant wait to start campaigning
should be easy
so far no competition
hell you know coca colas the worlds number one soft drink but they spend more money than anybody on advertising
i guess thats how come they stay number one
well good luck tracy they exchange a long curious stare
theres a tone at once confrontational and vaguely sexual about this moment
you know mr
when i win the presidency that means you and i are going to be spending a lot of time together next year
and i for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive
i just wanted to make sure
good luck tracy
jim pulls away and heads for the parking lot exit
jim drives stone faced unblinking
something about the music on the radio mocks him
i dont blame tracy for what happened with dave
how could i
dave was an adult more than twice her age
jim pulls to a stop next to a giant dumpster out of his window come yellowed newspapers balled up fast food bags and other detritus
he speeds away
sure she got on my nerves once in a while but i admired tracy
i really did
inside the dumpster we see tracys little bound book of signatures
jim and his wife diane sit at their dining room table eating chicken pot pies baked potatoes with sour cream salad with lite ranch dressing
not a word passes between them
thank god for diane
she was my best friend my source of love and strength
oh sure wed had our share of bumpy times but wed always seen them through
after nine years of marriage we were closer than ever
and the secret
just you know school
jim lies awake in bed while diane snores beside him
something seems to be echoing in his head
you know coca colas by far the number one soft drink
when i win the presidency were going to be spending a lot of time together
a lot of time
lots and lots and lots of time
president and advisor
close on jims ear as tracys lips magically whisper into it
harmonious and productive
close and special
you and i
in the darkness a light pops on and jim quietly pads down the stairs
he opens an old cedar trunk lifts out a few blankets and a piece of cardboard to reveal a row of porno tapes cleverly concealed in the bottom of the
a football player in uniform and helmet filets a cheerleader in a locker room
jim watches with detachment as though watching the news
he sips a can of pepsi
the football stud continues to bump and grind
looking at his pepsi can jim is suddenly inspired
paul metzler is skiing in goggles and scarf
behind him is a cheesy dated rear projection of other skiers
suddenly paul loses his balance and falls
close on paul writhing in the snow
i was so mad at god when i broke my leg at shadow ridge over christmas break
close on an x ray of a multiple fracture
the doctors told me id have to quit sports for at least a couple years if not forever
paul kneels in his football uniform
the photograph erupts in flames
which meant no first string quarterback in the fall
it was like the end of my life
paul stands talking to friends in a very typical high school tableau
all wear backpacks or carry books
a girl kneels to sign his cast
when i got back to school everybody was so supportive and they all wanted to sign my cast and everything
missouri river lockout day alone paul leans on his crutches and watches the river but i still couldnt shake the feeling that now my life had no purpose
what did god want from me
the vast missouri always flowing never stopping no beginning no end why did i exist
paul is sleeping slumped over a table his head cradled on crossed arms
the celestine prophecy is open face down next to him
sometimes you can search everywhere for answers
then one day destiny just taps you on the shoulder
i know because it happened to me
a finger reaches down and taps pauls shoulder
paul comes to and looks its mr
paul could i talk to you for a minute
his arm on pauls shoulder jim walks paul down a deserted hall and into jims classroom
jim picks up some scrap paper off the floor and puts it in the proper place
mcallister changed my life
and no matter what they say he did or did not do i believe he is a good man
jims classroom day paul sits in a chair while jim stands paul i know youve been pretty down since your accident
i wanted to play next year so bad i could taste it
and maybe go on to
i understand disappointment
i really do
but youve got a big choice right now
you can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life
or you can choose to see it for what it really is an opportunity
i personally think you have a big future ahead of you and i dont mean the fleeting glory of sports
what do you mean
let me give you a clue
youre a born leader
youre one of the most popular students at millard
youre honest and straightforward
you dont choke under pressure as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against westside
the other kids look up to you
what does that spell
paul furrows his brow and looks around searching for an answer
his lower lip is wet
it takes a moment for this to sink in
finally who me
i dont know anything about that stuff mr
besides thats tracy flicks thing
shes always working so hard and yeah no shes a go getter all right
and shes super nice yeah
but one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy doesnt it
thats more like a
well like a dictatorship like we studied
paul whats your favorite fruit
pears takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard
okay lets say no wait apples
jim draws illustrative circles on the board as he speaks
lets say all you ever knew was apples
apples apples and more apples
you might think apples were pretty good even if you occasionally got a rotten one
then one day theres an orange
and now you can make a decision
do you want an apple or do you want an orange
i also like bananas
so what do you say
maybe its time to give a little something back
tracy directs her friend eric overholdt on a ladder as he hangs a large poster high on a wall
the right side is too high
the right side
just a smidge
suddenly she notices a small commotion in the adjacent cafeteria and goes to investigate
a small crowd of students compete to sign pauls nomination petition taped to the wall
signing hey paul you going over to anthonys on friday or what did you decide
i gotta talk to him first
tracy watches the hubbub none too pleased and pushes her way to the front of the group
who put you up to this
oh hi tracy tracy stares at him
who put you up to this
what do you mean
you just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president
you know i just thought thought what
well see i was talking to mr
mcallister about my leg and everything
and how i still want to you know do something for the school and so mr
mcallister asked you to run
well i mean you know i talked to him and everything but he just said he thought it was a good idea
and how theres all different kinds of fruit and
its nothing against you tracy
youre the best
i just thought okay mr
with that tracy turns and signs pauls sheet the i in flick is dotted with a star close on tracys face as she walks away paul and his fans receding
behind her you might think it upset me that paul metzier had decided to run against me but nothing could be further from the truth
he was no competition for me it was like apples and oranges
it just meant i had to work a little harder thats all
in a xeroxed photograph
is written at the bottom
tracy is making campaign buttons with her button machine
she manufactures her buttons with almost alarming intensity
patriotic music begins to rise
you see i believe in the voters
they understand that elections arent just popularity contests
they know this country was built by people just like me who work very hard and dont have everything handed to them on a silver spoon
drop one by one into a box
all the little round tracys smile up at us
paul is in the drivers seat of his hitching big wheeled pickup truck
his door is open and his radio blasts a song carefully selected to boost soundtrack album sales
various friends of pauls hang around
tracy watches the scene from her seat on the school bus not like some rich kids who everybody likes because their fathers own metzier cement and give them trucks on
their sixteenth birthday and throw them big parties all the time
they dont ever have to work for anything
bus pulls away
staring into camera as she exercises on a nordic trac drenched in sweat she moves in a hypnotic frenzy
they think they can all of a sudden one day out of the blue waltz right in with no qualifications whatsoever and try to take away what other people have
worked for very very hard their entire lives
no it didnt bother me at all i paul drives home his stereo thumping
silent he appears lost in thought as though a little gopher idea were burrowing its way to the surface
oh look theres its snout now
paul for president
paul i tics
punt for paul
metzler home day paul pulls into the driveway and hops out of his car
two girls are kissing on the bed
they are tammy metzler and lisa flanagan fifteen and seventeen respectively
lisa breaks away
tammy tries to kiss her again but lisa resists
i told you
i just it doesnt feel right anymore you know
whistling a cheerful tune paul tosses his backpack on a chair grabs a banana and opens the refrigerator
tammy is still trying to comfort lisa
if you could just get out of your head
tammy leans forward puts her palm on lisas cheek
lisa looks at tammy as though at a stranger
tammy leans forward and
kisses lisas eyes
lisa jerks her head out of tammys hands
i said no
suddenly theres a quick knock at the door and paul enters
the girls rise quickly
hey tammy guess what happened today
dont you fucking knock
so guess what happened
mcallister he noticing lisa oh hi
paul get out
calls me in and tells me i gotta go
lisa pushes her way past paul and runs down the hall to paul you dumbshit
whatd i do
you know how they say one day a big meteor might come and crash into the earth and kill everybody
well i think that would be a good thing
back to life tammy turns away from paul in disgust and runs after lisa tammy finds the front door flung open and through it sees lisa slamming the door of
her beat up honda civic and starting the engine
lisa tammy runs up to the car as it pulls away
she pounds on the window
lisa stops the car rolls down the window where re you going
im not like you
im not a dyke okay and were not in love
we were just
i was just experimenting
lisa speeds away and we watch her car grow smaller and smaller
as we see the greatest disappointment of her short life break across her face
how can something that seems so true turn out to be such a lie
lisa and tammy are swinging synchronized on a swingset smiling and laughing
the image is slightly overexposed as though to suggest an ideal memory
close on tammy looking over at lisa i mean lisa and i were destined to be together
it was so obvious
of all the people on the planet who had ever lived somehow wed found each other
in slow motion swinging next to us
she looks back her face so happy
chomp chomp chomp tammy eats an asparagus spear
gnaw gnaw gnaw lisa eats an asparagus spear tammy drinks a big glass of water
she giggles a little
lisa drinks a big glass of water
she giggles too
i remember one time lisa and i did an experiment with asparagus to see how long it takes your pee to smell
we peed a little every five minutes
an egg timer ding i tammy and lisa very serious now smell little dixie cups for her it took about fifteen minutes and for me it was twenty
lisa studies at a table surrounded by other busy students
everyday i found some new way to tell lisa i loved her
suddenly tammy walks by drops a folded note in front of lisa and walks on
lisa opens it
tammys voice if you died right now i would throw myself into one of my dads cement trucks and get poured into your tomb
lisa looks over her shoulder at tammy who is now at the door of the library
tammy nods at her with quiet loving reassurance
but it just seemed like the closer we got the more she pulled away
lisa watches tammy open her locker and notices a four frame photo booth photograph taped to the inside of the door
in the photos lisa and tammy are clowning and smooching
lisa reaches over and yanks the photos off the door
are you crazy
people can see this
these are private these are for us
but other people can see them too
i dont care
well i do
lisa walks away with the photos close on lisa swinging next to us a final reprise of tammys favorite memory what did i do to make her change
whats wrong with me
lisa swings out of frame and the swing returns empty
a whisper lisa
tammy sits on a promontory overlooking an omaha public power district station towers wires insulators a loud hum
sometimes when im sad i sit and watch the power station
tammy lifts a pair of binoculars to her eyes sees the power plant
they say if you lie between two of the main wires your body just evaporates
you become a gas
i wonder what that would feel like
lisas car speeds away growing smaller and smaller
were back at the break up
close on tammys face as she stares down the street unable to move
it starts to rain
tears roll down her cheeks mixing with the rain
very french very sad
i don t know what i did to make lisa hate me so much but somehow she decided to hurt roe
and she knew exactly what to do
matched in size to tammys
he is moaning gasping
paul is sprawled on lisas bed surrounded by stuffed animals
his legs dangle over the edge of the bed and lisa kneels between them her head bobbing up and down
i sure was surprised the day lisa flanagan asked me for a ride home and ended up blowing me
lisa pauses and looks up at paul
ive wanted this for so long
she resumes with renewed vigor uhhh
paul and lisa sit with some other friends at a lunch table
paul has one arm around lisa as he eats with his other hand
life is so weird
first lisa has a big fight with my sister and the next thing you know shes my girlfriend
lisa turns around to look at tammy seated at another table directly behind them
she and lisa lock eyes before they both turn around again
paul poses for a campaign photo in his football uniform
he freezes in position as though about to throw a pass
lisa adjusts his position click
since lisa knew all about public relations and stuff she offered to help me with my campaign
we made a great team
tammy spies from underneath the bleachers paul is on all fours as lisa stands on his back to hang a poster with pauls football picture reading paul metzier you bet
it seemed so natural the two of us together
it was like destiny
tammy watches from a nearby classroom door her nose and cheek pressed against the window
pauls truck pulls up and paul and lisa get out that spring was perfect
my leg wasnt bugging me too much and the weather was so nice
and every afternoon after school
lisa and i would go to her house to fuck and have a swim
it was like we were in a world all our own
tammy emerges from behind a tree
shes on her bike
angry and fragile she watches the couple enter lisas house
tammy peeks over the fence and sees lisa and paul swimming
paul dives off the board and resurfaces right into lisas arms
move closer to tammy as she dies a thousand deaths
i had to do something
i didnt know what but i had to do something
a laughing baby boy is lowered into frame and pulled back up again
then he swings across frame
its little darryl novotny
jim has darryl by the ankles and is swinging him between his legs
diane and sherry are setting the picnic table
stacked charcoal briquettes burn off in a nearby barbecue
around that time diane and i were hanging out a lot at sherry novotnys house giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time
youre scaring him
he likes it
darryls laughter suddenly turns into crying here
give him to me
as she takes darryl is little darryl dizzy
you got him
sherry heads into the house
jim watches her walk then turns toward diane and darryl
its as though diane not sherry were the infants real mother so loving and attentive is she so swelled with maternal piety
diane really wanted to have kids and so did i but it seemed like there was always a reason to wait she had to finish nursing school i had to
get my masters we needed a new house we needed more money
finally we just decided to go for it
a digital thermometer reads
behind it diane lies in bed reading a copy of self
but for over a year we hadnt had any luck
and diane was getting desperate
at his desk jim studies a high society magazine
he is naked
jim closes his eyes and bites his lip as though feeling something he wished not to leave him
he quickly replaces a stack of magazines in his desk and goes across the hall to where lisas car speeds away growing smaller and smaller
were back at the break up
close on tammys face as she stares down the street unable to move
it starts to rain
tears roll down her cheeks mixing with the rain
very french very sad
waits in bed
she puts aside her magazine and welcomes papa bear
lisa pauses and looks up at paul
closes the door behind him
jim and diane copulate
although ostensibly near climax jim seems to be struggling
dianes exhortations once forbidden and exciting now seem routine
you gonna do it
you gonna do it
yeah uh just a minute come on doit
fill me up
come on fill me up yeah just do it
jim finally climaxes okay
with that jim rolls off of her
diane immediately hoists her knees to her chest
close on jim on his side of the bed facing away from diane
could you hand me the remote
jim is snapped out of his reverie by sherrys voice say jim
sherry is walking out the patio door holding a big bottle of wine with a corkscrew sticking out of it
could you get this
i cant sure
jim takes the bottle
close on the neck as the cork emerges pop
sherry stands at the base of a stepladder as jim climbs up and points to a spot on the ceiling
without dave around
sherry needed a lot of help around the house
indicating more this way
give me the drill
jim looks down at sherry as she hands it up
her blouse reveals a bit more than it should and jim pauses to get an extra glimpse
the power drill bit penetrates the ceiling
a shirtless jim is mowing the lawn on a hot day
he shuts it off as sherry emerges from the house with lemonade
she wears culottes a halter top and flip flops
id always liked sherry but wed never had a chance to spend any time alone together
how with dave out of the picture i began to see what an incredibly sensitive and giving person she was
jim downs his glass in big thirsty gulps and hands her back the glass
he watches her walk back to the house
plus she had finally dropped all that weight from her pregnancy and really she looked great
the ripcord of the lawnmower is pulled a couple of times until it starts
sherry looks at herself in the mirror modeling a colorful floppy hat
she spins around for jims approval
we got to be pretty good buddies
i even took her to the mall one time while her car was in the shop
jim smiles and nods
she puts on another
sherry is like a young girl on a date
she grabs jims hand and pulls him in another direction
at the makeup counter sherry spreads on lipstick
what do you think
its clear what jim thinks
you look great theyre driving home
there are packages on sherrys lap and in the backseat
i cant afford this stuff right now
oh come on
youve had a hard year youre cooped up with the kid all the time
let go live a little
they come to a stop at a red light
out one window jim spots a motel
so what do you think
should we get a room
should we get a what
points at the motel
her smile fades and she stares straight ahead
theres an icy uncomfortable silence
stiffly thats not funny
the light changes
jim swallows accelerates jim walks in through the backdoor
diane is loading the dishwasher
they peck kiss
howd it go
we just went to crossroads
you guys have fun
jim picks an apple out of a bowl
between bites yeah
i mean you know
well sherrys great
but she can be a little much sometimes
diane lies face down and jim is on top of her
jim makes spirited love with her
sherrys head like a cut out from a tabloid cover floats in from off screen and lands on the back of dianes head
at the right moment her face comes to life and vaguely mouths the words that diane is saying like a badly dubbed movie
just like that
fill me up
jims wicked desire increases with each movement now tracy flicks face floats over and replaces sherrys
tracy mouths dianes words
do it jim
jim is at once in deep space ecstasy and surprised at himself
dianes voice now changes its tracys voice
fuck me mr
mcallister so like i was saying things were going pretty well in my life
its passing period and hundreds of students clog the halls that is until things started going all haywire with that damn election
a distant ding ding grows louder and louder
everyone turns toward the source far down the hall and eventually tammy emerges wearing a makeshift sandwich board that reads tammy metzier for president
smiling a perverse smile she rings a hand bell
salvation army style
paul is at his locker and watches tammy go by
tammy what are you doing
tammy ignores her brother and keeps walking directly toward us finally into camera
millard teachers offices day tracy sits opposite mr
youre the advisor
you should stop her
shes not qualified
shes just a sophomore
calm down tracy
just calm down
are you sure all her signatures are real
its not easy to get all those signatures
as far as i know they suddenly lisa and paul are sitting where tracy was
we cant both run can we
were brother and sister
its a conflict of interest
and paul was first
anyone who gets signatures in on time can run
and she got in just under the wire
nothing i can do
now tracy replaces lisa and paul let me see them
let me see them sighing jim fishes in his drawer and hands tracy some sheets these are a bunch of burn outs
and look at this one i cant even read this one
taking the sheet looks like tim kobza
lisa and paul again shes doing this to get back at me for what
i mean at you
i dont know
youre her brother you should know
ive never heard of him
look why dont we just forget about tammy
well have the assembly tomorrow everybodyll make their speeches and im sure everything will be fine
the entire student body is assembled on the bleachers
there is a palpable mood of boredom and apathy
jerry slavin a handicapped kid in a wheelchair is at the microphone
his head lists to one side and he takes long breaths as he speaks
i love millard high and i will be a dedicated vice president
a vote for jerry slavin is a vote for good government
and even if i cant really stand up for you i will
cracks himself up thank you
jerry motors away amid scattered applause and coughs
jim steps forward clapping and raises the mike
thank you jerry and good luck
again jerry is running unopposed for vice president
so well move on now to the presidential race with three candidates running
the first in alphabetical order is tracy flick
tracy steps forward with a small stack of index cards
during her speech she flips the cards over one by one but rarely looks at them
poet henry david thoreau once wrote i cannot make my days longer so i strive to make them better
with this election we here at millard also have an opportunity to make our high school days better
during this campaign i have had the opportunity to speak with many of you about your concerns
i spoke with freshman eliza ramirez who told me how alienated she feels from her own homeroom
i spoke with sophomore reggie banks who said his mother works in a cafeteria and cant afford to buy him enough spiral notebooks for his classes
i wont bore you with long winded promises about all the new and innovative things i will definitely achieve during the year in which it will be my honor and
privilege to represent each and every one of you but i can say that my years of experience on the student council have taught me the three most important attributes the president needs to possess commitment eat me eat me raw
there is scattered laughter
tracy pauses wait hendricks bounds up and grabs the mike
if you cant be adults and give these candidates the courtesy they deserve then you dont deserve to be called adults but children because thats what children are
and youll be treated like children
so lets all listen up
walt backs away to his seat
tracy resumes the three most important attributes the president needs to possess are commitment qualifications and experience
ill add one more caring
i care about millard and i care about each and every one of you and together we can all make a difference
one of the things i would like to establish is a regular open forum where any student can come and voice their concern about issues we face here at millard
i and the rest of the student council would then interface with the faculty and staff so a continuous dialogue would exist
walt whispers to jim
id say she knows a thing or two about student faculty dialogue
jim nods solemnly when you cast your vote for tracy flick next week you wont just be voting for me
youll be voting for yourself and for every other student our days wont be any longer but they can sure be better
tracy smiles and walks back to her folding chair
there is polite applause and a few whistles
jjjb comes back to the microphone
tracy takes her seat next to paul and glances at him
paul scares straight ahead a fat bead of sweat on his forehead
one of his legs is jiggling
the next candidate for student body president is paul metzier
paul awkwardly makes his way to the mike
though by no means thunderous his applause clearly exceeds tracys
a small cluster of jocks woof for him shaking their fists in the air
paul manages a weak grin for his buddies
tracy shifts in her chair her smile stiff and forced lisa smiles and nods at paul from the bleachers giving him encouragement and a silent reminder to remember what they
tammys eyes dart between lisa and paul
she shows no emotion reveals nothing
the applause quickly dies and after a moment paul remembers to look at the white paper in his hand
he speaks in a barely audible monotone never once glancing up
as many of you know i broke my leg pretty bad thi year and the experience has made me reevaluate what i want to do with my life and that
is help people when you think about it a school is more than a school its our second home where we spend all cur time and grow as individuals and a community but is our school everything it could be i want our school to reach its true potential that is why i am running for president
jim pinches the bridge of his nose clearly pained a few loud sound effect snores saw through the air and walt points a stern finger at you guessed it doug
i know what it is to fight hard and win like when we almost went to state last fall and i threw that fourth quarter pass against westside for the
touchdown that won the game by three points i wont let you down like i didnt then i promise we can all score a winning big breath touchdown together
vote paul metzier for president thank you
paul now gets considerably less applause but his jock friends remain loyal
now our final candidate for president another one of the metzier clan sophomore tammy metzier
tammy approaches the mike
there are scattered mocking whistles and catcalls
tammy calmly looks over the crowd waiting for the jeers to subside
she makes eye contact with lisa who stares back
people i the room quiets down
tammy puts her lips close to the mike who cares about this stupid election
now theres something worth listening to
we all know it doesnt matter who gets elected president of millard
you think its going to change anything around here make one single person happier or smarter or nicer
the only person it matters to is the one who gets elected
the same pathetic charade happens every year and everyone makes the same pathetic promises just so they can put it on their transcripts to get into college
so vote for me because i dont even want to go to college and i dont care and as president i wont do anything
the only promise i make is that if elected i will immediately dismantle the student government so that none of us will ever have to sit through one of these
stupid assemblies again
there is a sudden huge cathartic eruption of cheers and applause
tammy has set them free
even cynical old doug schenken and his buddies join in
in total control she steps back from the mike and curtsies
walt shoots an angry confused look at jim who shrugs
tracy is clearly upset but her smile remains eerily fixed paul just looks confused and ashamed
jerry slavin is convulsed in laughter and chants along with the multitude
tammy quickly grabs the mike for one final exhortation
h dont vote for me i who cares
dont vote at all
the students go nuts
hendricks is in a serious post assembly discussion with jim and that little bitch made a fool of us i want her out of the election
getting everybody all riled up like that
shes finished you hear me
walt we cant throw her out of the election just because we dont like her speech
thats not what student governments about
all i know is shes a troublemaker
shes on my list
all we need to do is send a message so maybe we should just suspend her
shes suspended for a week
to emphasize his point walt throws his styrofoam cup at the wastepaper basket and misses
lowell the janitor passing by outside the door notices the cup bouncing on the floor
i think thats a little strong walt
we dont want to make a martyr out of her
three days sounds right to me
take care of it
tammy rides her bike on this crisp sunny spring day
the music is buoyant
tammy is all smiles
being suspended is like getting a paid vacation
too bad it was only three days tammy is hanging out by the entrance
a dude emerges from the store carrying a pack of beer
en route to his car he throws tammy a pack of cigarettes
here you go
tammy looks at the pack hey i said lights i a cigarette hanging out of her mouth tammy rides by the front of this catholic girls school
tammy gets off her bike goes to look through the surrounding fence at in their cleats short skirts jerseys
liturgical music accompanies slow motion close ups of the girls in action
tammy seems to breathe them in wearing headphones
tammy dances to music only she can hear
she happens to glance toward her door and notices a manila envelope sliding under it
she opens the door and finds a startled paul
what do you want
i was just you know i went to all your teachers and got your assignments
tammy looks at him picks up the packet
i just thought well last time you got suspended you fell so behind and okay paul
thanks a lot
paul smiles at the acknowledgment of his good deed
now could you leave me alone
oh one more thing
you know all this election stuff
cause you know everyone is saying its so weird that youre running against me and well it is kind of weird and you havent really told me why youre doing
it and didnt tell me in advance or anything
but thats okay you know
l respect your privacy
i just want you to know that no matter who wins if its you or me theres no hard feelings
were still brother and sister
and i hope you feel the same
no hard feelings
i feel good
paul is about to leave again but oh
one other thing
since you know lisa so well could you give me some advice
i want to get her something for helping me with the election
you know something really special like flowers or candy or flowers and candy
or is that too typical
i mean can you think of something
something really special
you know something shed really like
tammy looks as though shed like to push the button on all the worlds atomic bombs
drawn on white paper
a hand enters frame with a brush and begins to fill in the outline with blue tempera paint
camera rises to reveal the as part of a giant banner
tracy is working on some letters while eric overholdt is working on others
what happened at the speeches was an unconscienceable travesty
that little bitch tammy metzier wanted to make a fool out of me
well it wasnt going to work
people do care who wins
things do matter
finally were high enough to read eric the r is supposed to be green not blue
eric carefully paints over his mistake then works up some courage
so tracy i was wondering if after we finish with these youd like to go to a movie or something
im too busy
millard yearbook office night a haggard tracy sits alone at a computer monitor people are so ungrateful
if all those students who cheered for tammy metzier only knew how hard i worked for millard
like all the late nights i spent at the yearbook office just to give them their memories
displays a digitized photo of the millard yearbook staff
dave novotny peers proudly from behind two of the taller students
a cursor in the shape of tiny scissors makes a small circle around daves face
suddenly the cursor turns into a tiny hand and drags daves dislodged head into the trash
tracy concentrates as she deftly controls the mouse
one of my duties was to clean up the group photos
it was a cinch with our new software
as tracy outlines a piece of the wall and places it in the void where dave used to be blurring the edges for a perfect effect voila
satisfied tracy taps on the keyboard
under her breath lets see
save is command s
tracy is heading down the hall toward the exit when she rounds a corner and suddenly deeply troubled sees that her new who cares
banner has come loose on an upper corner and is drooping
tracy puts down her things and jumps up to slap the corner back into place
satisfied she turns away
but then shoop
the banner fights back peeling even further from the wall
tracy prepares for battle
tracy enters and grabs a long aluminum straight edge
standing on an overturned garbage can and wielding the straight edge tracy tries to smooth the banner
but shes not holding the ruler flat against the wall and rip
she slices the banner lengthwise
now the plastic garbage can begins to buckle
struggling to retain her balance tracy accidentally hooks the banner and as she tumbles yanks the whole thing down
overcome with anger and frustration she thrashes around on the ground and tears up what remains of her banner
paul metzler smiles down at tracy from his poster across the hall
tracy looks up at it
instantly she is on her feet lunging for the poster
she jumps up tears it down and rips pauls head into pieces
blood issues from a thin paper cut on one hand
tracy regards it at first without comprehending then raises it to her mouth
while sucking her wound her gaze falls on another smiling paul mocking her pain
hurricane tracy begins a savage assault on the fragile coast of millard high
pauls campaign posters fill the air shredded to pieces by the powerful winds of jealousy and rage
to tracy even farther down the hall still jumping still ripping
track from overhead the hallway floor where a thousand bits of paul lie scattered a grinning mouth here an eye there
tilt up finally to tracy sweating panting
she finishes ripping a poster and looks to find another
but there are no more paul posters she has destroyed them all
tracy raises her hands and sees they are streaked with blood
tracy is at the sink washing away the blood
she pats her hands dry with paper towels
the gravity of what shes done now sinks in and she panics
i didnt do this
i didnt do it
she lifts the top off a garbage can removes the plastic liner
with frantic haste tracy stuffs the evidence of her awful deed into the garbage bag
tracys face is half obscured by the bulging bag she carries down the sidewalk
tracy opens her trunk and heaves the garbage bag inside slamming the trunk she looks around no one
tracy drives sucking on a wounded hand
she glances frequently in the rear view mirror
tracys car drives down a remote road
there are no sidewalks here and the surroundings consist of scrubby vegetation and industrial structures
in the background looms a power plant
we now sense that tracy has a plan
she throws the car into reverse backs up and turns onto tracy stop the car near an embankment
she gets out and pulls the garbage bag from the trunk
with a big shove tracy sends the bag cartwheeling down the hill breathing hard but clearly relieved tracy watches the evidence of her deed tumble into obscurity
now through binoculars tracys shadowy figure runs back to the car
tammy momentarily drops her binoculars before raising them again
through the binoculars tracys car speeds away
tammy drops her binoculars and mounts her bike tammy skids to a stop drops her bike and heads down the embankment
as tammy draws near
she pauses at first but intrepid curiosity conquers her fear
she unties the knot
from inside the bag we see tammys sudden look of horror pauls mangled face smiles up at her
tammy raises it toward camera as a hand extracts a huge wad of hair stringy mucousy
jim holds it up for sherry who stands behind him in her bathrobe
theres your culprit he examines it from different angles
both scrunch their faces shall we give it a name
not missing a beat dave
close on an open toilet plop
the hairwad joins several smaller stringy friends
jim washes his hands
sherry glances between jim and the water running in the shower
its getting steamy
did you know daves a bed wetter
uh didnt know that all his life
hes tried everything
about the shower still clear
well let it run awhile jim turns off the faucet and reaches for a towel
sherry offers him another
this ones clean
jim takes it and dries his hands
sherry now stands very close to him
jim sets the towel on the sink
its a little awkward as they look into each others eyes standing so near
i guess youd better get to work huh
youre going to be late
she slowly wraps her arms around jims neck and pulls him to her a hug of gratitude and warmth nothing sexual here just the embrace of two people in need
of shelter from the storm of life
no nothing sexual at all
thank you jim
now sherry begins to cry a little and things begin to change hands wander cheek brushes cheek
finally lips meet tenderly at first
and then it is a deluge
jim and sherry stumble in from the hallway locked in an embrace
they rove around the room barely able to keep their balance
finally they fall to the ground
playing with his foot in the crib
through the bars behind him we can discern the murky shape of sherry and jim rutting and grunting like wild boars
jim starts his car
sherry leans into his window
she looks around the neighborhood before kissing him firmly on the mouth
take me to that motel
like you wanted
come by after school
ill leave darryl with the sitter
three twenty five
three twenty five
jim roars past us in his new red ferrari convertible jim wears a black suit and hip hraparound sunglasses as he drives
he lights a cigarette
behind him is a cheesy dated rear projection of a curvy mountain road
next stop portofino
what had blossomed between sherry and me was too real too powerful to deny
for the first time in years i felt free and alive
jims ferrari heads up the driveway and into his assigned space he opens the ferrari door
jims foot touches the pavement not a shiny salvatore ferragamo loafer but a worn out dexter
jim is back in his own clothes and his car has reverted to a ford escort in need of a wash
he heads toward the school
jim enters the library walks among the stacks
so as you can imagine my thoughts werent on the election that monday morning
jim takes a book from the shelf my thoughts were only on sherry on how perfect she felt inside
there was a special poem i wanted to read to her later at the motel as she lay next to me
jim flips through the book and finds the poem he seeks
his lips move silently
close close the lovers keep
they stay together in their sleep
close as two pages in a book that read each other in the dark
suddenly a grating voice from the loudspeakers
mcallister to the principals office
mcallister to the principals office
jim smacks the book closed lisa flamagan her face streaked with tears from outrage and confusion
its not fair
its not fair paul sits next to lisa on the vinyl sofa
he wants to console her but he doesnt know how
i just dont think anybody would do something like that on purpose
it must have been some kind of mistake
like a maintenance thing
jim where the hell have you been
i dont have class until second period
even tried you at home
weve got a situation here
if paul loses tomorrow its not fair
there has to be another election with posters
whats the problem
didnt you see
somebody tore down their posters
those posters cost a lot of money we dont have i theres no time to make any more posters theres no well get to the bottom of it
to lisa we still have some extra ones dont we
maybe we can just it was tammy i thats who it was
oh no hey
like i said
well that speech she gave it was pretty you know pretty out there
but well get to the bottom of it
dont you worry
mcallister is going to see to that
his thoughts elsewhere oh yeah you bet
she should be expelled
you two just go back and focus on your studies
mcallisters going to handle this
as a vial containing blue liquid is held to the flame
the solution magically changes from blue to yellow
wearing goggles tracy holds the beaker with chemists tongs her two lab partners observe
the classroom door and a student approaches the teacher mr
beckman to deliver a note
tracy looks up through her goggles
long tracking shot
of tracy as she leaves the classroom
as she walks through the
desolate halls and descends a flight of stairs she holds her head high suggesting a serene almost regal confidence
when i arrived at school that morning i was shocked to find that one of my key banners had been removed by vandals
i noticed that a few of my rivals posters had also been tampered with
of course i was outraged but one day before the election is not the time to lose your head over a couple of posters
when youre in the public eye attacks like that just come with the territory
finally she reaches the upon seeing tracy miss linda beeder the they re all my kids office administrator points wordlessly to an open door of a conference room
come on in
and shut the door behind you
she goes in and closes the door in our face
tracy is seated in a chair
jim hovers above her alternately leaning on a desk and pacing
i guess you know why youre here if its about the posters i think its so awful
its a travesty
thats interesting because i think you did it
wait are you accusing me
youre not serious
indignant i cant
mcallister we have worked together on sga for three solid years and
i mean i cant believe it
jim stares at her
i am running on my qualifications
i would never need to resort to you know to vandalism like a you know
plus my own best banner was torn down
did i do that too
were you or were you not working in the watchdog office over the weekend
pecharda let me in
as you know with all my responsibilities i often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so
but i left very early around
how do you know what time the posters were torn down
i just know they were there when i left
im giving you helpful information is all
you know instead of wasting time interrogating me we should be out there trying to find out who did this
okay tracy so who do you think did it
whom should we interrogate
well i dont know
it could have been anybody
there are a lot of you know subversive elements around millard
you know like rick thieson and kevin speck and those burn outs
or doug schenken what about him
or what about tammy metzier
her whole thing is being anti this and anti that
jim shifts gears youre a very intelligent girl tracy
you have many admirable qualities
but someday maybe youll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead and yes stepping on people to get
there well theres a lot more to life than that
and in the end youre only cheating yourself
why are you lecturing me
this isnt the time or the place to get into it but there is for just one example a certain former colleague of mine who made a very big mistake
a life mistake
i think the lesson there is that old and young we ail make mistakes and we have to learn that our actions all of them can carry serious consequences
youre very young tracy underage in fact but maybe one day youll understand
i dont know what youre referring to but i do know that if certain older and wiser people hadnt acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy everything would
but i also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very very grateful the whole school didnt find out about certain indiscretions which
could have ruined their reputations and chances to win certain elections
and i think certain older persons like you and your colleague shouldnt be leaching after their students especially when some of them cant even get their own wives pregnant
and they certainly shouldnt be running around making slanderous accusations
especially when certain young naive peoples mothers are para legal secretaries at the citys biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits
and if you want to keep questioning me like this i wont continue without my attorney present
jim draws a long breath as he tries to control himself okay tracy
have it your way
theres a knock
jim and tracy turn to see tammy metzler timidly poking her head in
you wanted to see me mr
just wait outside
but is this about the posters
please just wait outside
looking at tracy because i know who did it
ill just be outside
tammy manages to squeeze in a naughty little smile before closing the door
tammy sits patiently in a chair bobbing to an unheard song
the door opens and tracy emerges
tracy dont go away
come in tammy
as tammy and tracy cross tracy speaks in a low voice but loud enough for jim to hear
this ought to be good tammy sits facing jim cradling her backpack
what do you have to tell me
well this is hard for me but i think its important to be honest
impatient what is it
im the one
i did it
i tore down pauls posters
looks at her skeptically doesnt say a word
i did it
and when did you do it
i dont know
and how did you get in the school
door was open
i dont know
all i know is i did it i i dont believe you
i have proof
she burrows in her backpack
tracy stands up from her seat and manages to peek through the window of the conference room
she sees pulling out a handful of poster shreds from her backpack and handing them to jim
tracy turns away and covers her mouth with one hand
the poster fragments in jims hands
tilt up to tammy really hamming it up
you dont know what its like to grow up in the shadow of an older brother like paul
its always paul paul paul paul
im only pauls little sister
you must be pauls little sister
hes so perfect and im so troubled
i hate him
i hate him
and i tore down his posters it was a horrible cowardly act but i did it
i did it
l did it
and im not sorry
jim watches her performance until he cant take it anymore hes got other fish to fry
final i dont know what your problem is but if thats the way you want it thats the way itll be
i dont have time
youre out of the election and im turning you over to dr
he throws the door open
tracy is frightened but still plays the indignant victim
looks like todays your lucky day what does he mean
what do you mean
youre off the hook
tammy here has confessed
it takes tracy a second to figure out how to react
but once shes got it she runs with it
i told you
i told you
pointing at tammy youre going to pay for my banner
thats enough tracy
quit while youre ahead okay
ill handle this
to hiss seeder could you ask walt to come in
jim is feverishly typing
the rest of the day was unbearable
i kept smelling sherry on my clothes and on my fingers and i just couldnt wait to get out of there
he yanks the paper out of the carriage and hurries away
a photocopy collator in operation
jim pulls sheets out and stacks them
i wanted everything to be perfect that afternoon so i decided to give myself a little time to prepare during eighth period
students are settling into their seats
jim breezes in a sheaf of papers fucked under his arm
pop quiz everybody the class groans
if youve done your reading this is an easy one
jim peels off a stack of papers for each row id have exactly forty eight minutes to make all the arrangements
jim glances at the clock if you finish early just sit quietly and check your work
ill be right back
poof hes gone i track with jim as he sprints toward the parking lot fumbling for his keys
jim exits with a bouquet of flowers and a plastic bag
jims car speeds into the driveway and parks jim opens the door sets his things down and gets to work
jim dumps a bucketful of ice and wedges in a bottle of cheap jim props up his flowers in the ice bucket and puts a small box of russell stovers
candy next to it
he unwraps the motels plastic cups and places them just so
jims book of poetry open to that special poem
he marks it with a carnation
jims face appears as he kneels down and slides the book into place ready for that perfect moment
where jim is naked now squatting in the bathtub frantically washing his undercarriage
he checks his watch
jim shuts the door and with jaunty confidence slips the key into his pocket
jims car speeds toward the street
jim gets out of his car and races back toward the school
jim skids around a corner
with feigned coolness he saunters into class just as the bell rings
okay everybody pass them forward
stephanie put down your pen
the class begins to rise
ill see you all on wednesday
and dont forget to vote tomorrow
from behind jims back has a large vulva shaped patch of sweat jim hurries back to his car weaving his way through students jim pulls to a stop in sherrys
jim checks his watch turns into bingo jims finger on the doorbell
jim waits rings again
he tries the door
maybe shes out back
he walks around the house to its a lovely little backyard
springtime flowers bloom
bees buzz among the peonies
jim opens the gate approaches the back door and knocks
sherry i he rears back and aims his yell toward the second floor
sherry i its jim
he tries the door
jim cranes his neck for a last look at the house
as he starts to leave he calls out one final time not really expecting a response
sherry suddenly a wasp stings him above his right eye oww
cursing and holding his head jim stumbles out the gate through the glass windows we see jims car pull into the lot and park
jim enters the lobby
his eye is puffy and red
a motel employee watches tv behind the counter by any chance has a woman shown up in the last half hour or so
maybe she was looking for me
nobodys come in here looking for anybody
are you sure
indicating jims eye you okay
the telephone as jim punches in sherrys number
jim holds the phone against his ear and the champagne bottle against his eye
sherry its me
are you there
i came by at like we said and waited but you werent there
anyway i hope youre okay im worried about you
so now im just at the
at the place we talked about
so im here
everythings all set
you can just come over
time lapse as the sky darkens the motels neon sign turns on
jim now descends the motel stairway carrying his walgreens sack
he puts the key into the drop box and gets in his car
dick metzier and his wife jo are at the breakfast table tammy sits across from them her eyes lowered
i dont get it
what you have against your mother and me against your brother paul is completely beyond me
and your mother is extremely upset shes at the end of her rope
your behavior gets crazier and crazier and wilder and wilder and who knows what the hell else youre doing out there that we dont even know about
dad i jabbing his finger dont you smartass me
dont you dare smartass me
you just shut your mouth i taking a breath now your mother and i have had a long talk with halt hendricks we just got off the phone with him
you know he doesnt want you back at millard
hes fed up with you
and i dont blame him
calmly tammy now weve come to a decision
he just think it would be best youre going to catholic school next year
youre going to sacred heart
maybe theyll straighten you out
angle from under the table her head low
tammy smiles to herself jims car pulls into the driveway
jim enters the back door and sets his satchel down in the usual place
he opens the refrigerator grabs a beer
as he closes the door something catches his eye
he reaches inside and throws a plastic container away
rooting around noisily he finds other things to dispose of
suddenly a baby cry stops him cold
jim stiffens his good eye widening as the horrible truth sinks in
he carefully closes the refrigerator and tiptoes toward the living room
jims face slowly appears around the corner bad eye first
finally hes able to see together on the living room sofa staring at him
their eyes are red from crying
little darryl squirms in sherrys lap
caught jim emerges from his hiding place
no one speaks
finally he looks down sucks in air blows it out again nods a little
very softly okay he turns to leave and nobody stops him
jim wanders out the front door and stands in his driveway bewildered and alone
the camera slowly cranes up eventually looking down on him from a great height
as i walked out of my home that evening unsure if id ever return my entire life in question i somehow discovered within myself a place of perfect peace
oddly in my solitude i felt more than ever a sense of communion with every human being past present and future
because no matter what we tell ourselves no matter what illusions of friendship and family we create each of us is always and forever profoundly alone
from overhead tracy slides out of her bed and kneels beside it dear lord jesus i do not often speak with you and ask for things but now i really
must insist that you help me win the election tomorrow because i deserve it and paul metzier doesnt as you well know
l realize that it was your divine hand that disqualified tammy and now im asking that you go that one last mile and make sure to put me in office
where i belong so that i may carry out your will on earth as it is in heaven
if elected i promise that i will pray more often
tammy wears a white t shirt and underwear and kneels at her bedside
dear god i know i dont believe in you but since ill be starting catholic school soon i thought i should practice
what do i want
i want people to be nicer to each other
i want lisa to realize what a bitch she has been and feel really bad and apologize for how she hurt me and know how much i still love her
in spite of everything i still want paul to win the election tomorrow not that cunt tracy
i also want a really expensive pair of leather pants
and someday i want to be really good friends with madonna
love tammy from overhead paul lies in bed looking at the heavens beyond his ceiling dear god thank you for all your blessings
you have given me so many things like good health nice parents a nice truck and what ive been told is a large penis and im very grateful
but i sure am worried about tammy
in my heart i still cant believe she tore down my posters but sometimes she does get so weird and angry
please help her be a happier person because shes so smart and sensitive and i love her
also im nervous about the election tomorrow and i guess i want to win and all but i know thats totally up to you
youll decide who the best person is and ill accept it
and forgive my sins whatever they may be
jim sits parked outside of sherrys house a slurpee held against his now grotesquely swollen eye
he is so tired and pain ridden that he practically gasps for breath
sherry never came home that night
i know because i spent the entire night in her driveway
tracy and her mom are hard at work frosting cupcakes
mom and i got up at five am and together we custom iced three hundred and fifty cupcakes
close on a cupcake as pick flick is written on it with a yellow icing tube
flick cheerfully performs her task
i remember she was so happy like there was nothing in the world shed rather be doing
besides me and her job i guess my mom doesnt have much of a life
she hasnt dated anyone since frank and she hardly ever buys new clothes for herself or travels
i think im going to lose today what are you talking about
this time tomorrow youll be president you really think so
flick puts an arm around her daughter tracy flicks a winner
jims car has not moved from its spot on the driveway
its windows are now fogged
a loud garbage truck rumbles by
reclined in his car seat mouth open as he sleeps jim is awakened by the truck
his breath steams
his eye has turned bluish
he tries to wipe the condensation from the windshield but its on the outside
jim opens the door and looks around no sign of sherrys car
he stiffly walks to the side of the garage and unzips his pants to pee
now cradling his head on the roof of his car jim gathers what little strength he has gets in and tries to start the cold engine
i had no choice but to go home
i needed to shower get fresh clothes explain what i could to diane
but what was i going to say
that our marriage had become a charade
that making love with sherry had given me a vision of a better life
the tailpipe finally coughs out a cloud of exhaust jim drives bleary eyed
he creeps along his tree lined middle class block
then again maybe i could slip in and out without waking her up
jim slows to a stop looks with dread at his home on the front porch sits a gym bag
jim approaches stares numbly at the bag
drawing a long breath he bends over and picks it up
attached is a note reading dont come in
at the foot of the main walk to the school tracy and her mother are setting up a card table covered with little pink cakes
jims ford escort chugs its way through the fog and comes to a stop
looking like a war refugee jim emerges from his car carrying the gym bag and heads toward school
chirping good morning mr
jim stops turns slowly regards mother and daughter with a crazed one eyed uncomprehending stare
holding one out looks like you could use a cupcake
jim takes it wordlessly
as he heads up the walkway he eats it in two huge bites like a feral animal
calling out whats wrong with your eye
are you in the showers jim scrubs himself as if to wash his whole life away
my life was crumbling and i was expected to care about these ungrateful kids and their pathetic little dreams
as if my only purpose in life were to serve them
somebody tore down my posters
its not fair
its not fair
can i have an a
can i have a recommendation
at the mirror jim adjusts his tie tries to smooth his wrinkled shirt
well fuck them
didnt i have my own life
didnt i have my own dreams
he coughs up phlegm and spits it into the sink cupcakes jim exits the boys locker room door and bumps into mr
big day today putting on a smile oh yeah
miss beeder of the school office is at the p
walt is behind her
she looks over her shoulder and walt gives her the go ahead
we have an important announcement from our principal
walt gives miss beeder a courtesy smile and takes the mike good morning students
it uh behooves me to inform you of an important change in todays elections
effective this morning
ballot after ballot as a black magic marker crosses out tammys name
jim sits at his desk and carries out his absurd task
he stops and stares
his thoughts wander far far away
sophomore tammy metzier has been
metzier has been determined ineligible i repeat ineligible for sga president
you may not vote for tammy metzier
all other candidates are eligible
now please pay attention to a very important uh audio visual presentation
irritated thinking hes off linda who typed this thing
i said i need all caps
close on a tv mounted in the corner
an educational video is just beginning
host clark naylor sits on the edge of a desk in a generic office set
during the video we cut to classrooms where from the tvs point of view we see the students watching english class shop class gym class biology class
hello students im clark naylor of joslyns educational resources
its election day and how you vote will make a big difference in the activities events and perhaps even the policies of your school
over the past few days or weeks youve heard candidates for the various offices make their speeches and tell you where they stand
youve probably seen their posters
maybe youve even had a chance to speak with them personally
now replace the wider shots of classrooms
photographed as though from a soviet propaganda film some students look up nobly and attentively while others watch with dead eyes and open mouth and still others goof off
well today marks the end of campaigning and now the spotlight turns to you
voting is your privilege and your responsibility
remember no one needs to know for whom youve voted
thats between you
an african american teenager walks up to clark
now id like to introduce you to tony
tonys going to show you how to cast your vote
are you ready tony
i think s good
lets get started jim slinks down the hall and ducks into a phone booth
he fishes change out of his pocket and dials
we hear the echo of the video emanating from all the classrooms
youve reached the novotnys
were not around but well call you back real soon
have a nice day
are you there
sherry are you there
suddenly angry why did you do that
i trusted you
youve ruined my life
do you know that
do you realize that
youve ruined dianes life
you ruined my life
is that what you wanted
recovering im sorry
im going nuts here
okay all right so
really im sorry
i just think we should talk okay
i love you
jim crosses out more ballots this time with perverse intensity
if only my own life could be corrected so easily with nice fat black lines drawn neatly through my sins
as it is blackened
we wipe with the motion of the magic marker to the curtain of the dressing room is drawn back and theres tammy
she beams and walks toward where she takes herself in dressed in her new catholic schoolgirl the saleslady converses nearby with jo metzier
and sacred heart is such a good school
the public schools are going downhill as far as im concerned
well weve had good luck at millard but for this one its time for a change
tammy spins and admires the flip of the skirt
so what do you think
sacred heart has the prettiest
they have that nice hint of purple
lying i hate it
youre just going to have to get used to it
please dont make me go to sacred heart
i beg you
to saleslady well take two
makeshift polling booths are set up just outside the cafeteria
behind two tables sit two teachers who cross out voters names on big master computer lists
tracy stands in line not so patiently waiting her turn
when the time came to cast our votes i stood in line just like everyone else
she finally reaches the front of the line
hi tracy tracy enid flick
tracy goes into a voting booth and quickly hands her ballot
sophomore phil choy stands nearby with his camera
phil you ready
tracy exits the booth and heads toward the ballot box
she inserts her ballot halfway and freezes smiling
phil snaps a picture but just a second
tracy remains perfectly still while phil fiddles with his camera
a student stands behind her waiting to put his ballot in the box
come on tracy
through her smile just wait
phil gets his shot and tracy drops her ballot in
on her way out tracy passes paul at the end of the line
he gives her an enthusiastic thumbs up
way to go tracy
isnt this exciting
hell good luck
reluctant good luck to you too paul
voting booth paul scans his ballot struggles with his decision
its so weird
do people always just vote for themselves
cause looking at my own name on the ballot i just
i dont know i just felt like its not right to vote for yourself
the ballot as pauls pen puts an x next to the name tracy flick the ballot box is being carried through the halls and up some stairs by larry fouch
and three other student council members
the music suggests the weighty importance of its contents and the sacred mission of its bearers
jim is hunkered over his desk
hes a wreck dark dark circles under his eyes his hair didnt dry right frizzy here matted there
and hes near tears
larry fouch and his retinue enter cheerfully okay mr
larry drops the ballot box on jims desk what
so lets start counting
well i thought that
well the way it always works is that sga president does a count then the sga advisor you know for the two independent counts
so do your count
start with president and ill be right back
you have the key mr
jim doesnt understand at first then right
jim proceeds to sort through his cluttered desk drawers but cant seem to find the key
the council members exchange concerned looks as jims search becomes frenzied
are you okay mr
what happened to your eye
its just a bee sting a simple little everyday bee sting
some people they get stung its no big deal
me i swell up
jim emerges from the drawer wielding a vise grip
he goes to the box and tears the entire hardware assembly off
holding the mangled lock he turns to the students who look back stunned
i just want to get this over with so we can have the assembly and go home
we dont have much time until eighth period
i have other things going on too you know
we know all right
ill be back jim slinks up to a pay phone inserts a coin dials cheery hi
youve reached the novotnys
were not around but well call you back real soon
have a nice day
jim its me again
im sorry for all the calls
but sherry if i could just hear your voice if youd only acknowledge that i
picking up phone what do you want jim
i love you
loud exhale dont say that
you know its not true
its the only true thing i know anymore
we made a mistake
lets not make it worse
that was no mistake
i was lonely
you took advantage me
i took advantage of you
you hugged me
you kissed me
youre the one who its passing period and the halls are jammed with students at their lockers and walking to class
jim is walking quickly back to his classroom
he passes paul
big day huh
jim doesnt even hear
larry is just finishing his count
the ballots are on a desk in front of him neatly organized into three piles
impatient what dyou got
im not supposed to tell
not until youve counted too
were each supposed to make an independent count
youre kidding right
i thought those were the rules mr
if theyve changed in any way larry were not electing the fucking pope here
just tell me who won
jims use of profanity scares larry and he responds reluctantly its a squeaker mr
ive got tracy by a vote
just one vote
jim who hasnt cared about any of this today suddenly takes note
he stares blankly at larry as the news sinks in
well i guess id better do my count
jim scoops up the three piles of ballots and takes them to his desk
a junior honors student
he is thinking
the wheels are turning grinding
flagg is lecturing really trying to make history come alive
tracy takes notes but she is noticeably distracted
and what year was that
so the point here is when we found out about sputnik we got really scared
it seemed like no matter what we had and kept secret they could develop it too
a bombs h bombs rocket ships
and this time we were behind them
so february kennedy tells congress and the american people he wants to go to the moon
may the apollo program is announced
tracy just cant take it anymore
she abruptly stands up takes the giant hall pass off the lip of the blackboard and starts to leave
flagg gives her a small nod
tracy nears a room a special room
she slows down and peeks in the window of the door
she sees larry fouch sitting at the back of the classroom staring front
tracy presses her face to see what larry is staring at jim at his desk counting ballots larry catches sight of tracy in the window
tracy crosses her fingers by her ears and gives a questioning look larry sneaks a guilty look at jim absorbed in his counting
then against his better judgment flashes tracy a quick furtive double tracy suddenly disappears from the window
in the empty hallway tracy pogos with unbridled joy you know that moment when they announce the winner of a beauty pageant
when miss texas or whoever suddenly realizes shes miss america and all she can do is scream and weep and hug the losers
i had my moment in the hallway that tuesday afternoon with no one to hug but myself
she pulls herself together enough to peek through the window of the other door to jims classroom the window behind which jim is still busily doing his count
jim counts out the last of the ballots mouthing the numbers to himself
i was at the end of my count when it happened
id come up with exactly the same numbers as larry tracy had won the election by a single vote to
i was about to announce my tally when
jim looks up and sees tracy in the window her face exploding with joy
we move closer to jim in slow motion
what actually occurs in a split second is suspended in time the sight of tracy at that moment affected me in a way i cant fully explain
part of it was that she was spying but mostly it was her face
looking at her you might think she was a sweet innocent teenage girl
but she wasnt sweet
and she wasnt innocent
she was selfish and cynical and ambitious and thought nothing of destroying the lives of others to get to the top
who knew how high she would climb in life how many people would suffer because of her
i had to stop her now
tracy unfreezes and darts out of sight
jim glances at larry
larry is writing in a notebook
creeps up from his lap and onto the pile of tracy votes
his fingers nimbly count two ballots and pull them off the desk
jim coughs as beneath his desk he crumples the ballots into a ball and drops them into the wastepaper basket
looking up yeah
i think weve got a problem
walt is just finishing counting the ballots on his desk
larry and jim stand over him
i get the same as you jim
looks like pauls our president
no way i it doesnt make sense
my figures work out exactly the same as jims
for paul for tracy
and disregards right
if you say so
mostly tammy fans see it doesnt add up
there are only ballots but people voted
two votes are missing
check the register
two people must have pocketed their ballots
usually its more
but they were there i counted votes
it happens larry
people make mistakes
i didnt make a mistake
every vote was there when you sac down whoa
i dont like where youre going
im telling you
hendricks every vote was accounted for
weve got twenty five minutes until the assembly and we still have to do counts for vp treasurer and secretary
hendricks and i have both verified the numbers and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing but mr
fouch thats enough
end of story
an assembly the students are taking their seats on the bleachers
are all the candidates three for secretary two for treasurer one for vice president two for president
paul and tracy sit side by side
paul seems a little overwhelmed by the whole thing
tracy leans over and offers her hand
paul i just want you to know that no matter how this turns out youve run a wonderful campaign
its been fun competing with you
yeah you too tracy
im just glad its over
you know i dont understand why everybody bad mouthed tracy all the time
she was always super nice to me
jim approaches the microphone if we could get started
once the winners are announced we can all go home okay
the students quiet down some contests are so well fought that is seems unfair for someone to win and someone to lose
i think thats the case with all the candidates you see before you today
all of them are highly qualified and embody the uh the integrity we expect from our school leadership
os tracy jims voice momentarily recedes
walk slowly to the podium
thank them for this incredible honor
that said the whole point of an election is to choose winners and that you have done
well begin with president
jim pulls a folded paper from his back pocket let me add that this was an extraordinarily close race
its my pleasure to announce the next president of millard high school
tracy just cant wait
smiling she stands up
the crowd breaks into applause and laughter on tracy as she sits her smile belies her horror and humiliation paul begins his acceptance speech
we cut alternately to a thrilled lisa a stunned tracy tears forming at the corners of her eyes and to jim who watches the events with shifty eyes his mouth
dry and tasting of metal
geez you guys thanks a lot
i mean wow thanks
i promise to do my best and really do a good job and be a good president
and i want to thank lisa flanagan for being a super campaign manager
and i just want to say that i think tracy would have made a great president too and that she really deserves a big hand
the auditorium erupts into applause and whistles and jim takes the microphone again
and now for vice president
in the growing darkness the restaurant radiates its distinctive orange glow
the parking lot is nearly empty
jim sits alone at a booth by the window finishing a slice of berry pie
he gets the attention of a waitress and holds up his coffee cup
could i get a
as jim gets his warm up in walk the metziers paul dick and jo
jim notices them as they wait to be seated
he wishes he were invisible
as a perky hostess leads the family to a table paul spots jim
here it comes
this is so wild
we came to celebrate my victory and i cant believe it
here these are my parents
jim stands up awkwardly
extending his hand hi
my wife this is great
extending his hand jim mcallister
extending her hand jo metzier
you know paul just thinks the world of you
oh if you could just hear him
yeah say apparently youve really come behind him really helped him out there with the student council thing and all
i never would have ran if it wasnt for mr
paul doesnt need any of my help
hes going places
you should be very proud
we are having a problem with your eye there
just a bee sting
you ought to get that looked at
shot of cortisone or something
thanks ill be fine
anyway were awful sorry about what went on with our other one you know our tammy
we were mortified
oh shes not a bad girl
shell come around
but weve had some good talks and i think were sorting things out
were starting her at sacred heart in the fall
say youre all alone why dont you join us
im just finishing up here and ive got to get home
to his parents why dont you guys go sit down okay
ill catch up in a minute
i want to talk to mr
about some important stuff
well sure nice to meet you
so nice you bet
the metziers go and paul slides in across from jim
m i was starting to think about ideas for next year
i was thinking it would be cool to have like a carnival
and you know it could be for like
jim tries to smile and seem attentive but we sense his profound fatigue and his profound sadness
and on halloween we could have a haunted house
but a really good haunted house not like those cheesy bad ones
you know more like the radio station ones
this one would be really scary
and for homecoming well you know how last years theme was paul
well have plenty of time to get into all this later
a whole year in fact
right now i just need to finish my pie and get home
the wind out of his sails paul gets up and is about to go when just one more thing
uh do you think tracys going to be okay
i saw her face after the assembly and i think shes taking it pretty hard
dont worry about tracy
shell be fine
her face drained and pallid her eyes red and bleary she is exhausted from crying
one vote she falls again headlong again into the throes of despair
her mouth contorts into a rictus of agony and there issues an almost feral cry of pain
her anguish grows convulsive
barbara flick comes in and sits on the bed
shes carrying a prescription bottle and a glass of milk
why dont you take a couple of my pills darling
youll feel better
tracy takes the pills and sips the milk weakly
her mother kisses her
don t worry
don t worry
thats it baby
thats it darling
everythings going to be fine
she lays tracy on the bed and tracy begins to quiet
barbara kisses her again and rises to leave
at the door she pauses to add a few final words of comfort
maybe you needed more posters honey
or if youd taken my suggestions about your speech
i dont know
well figure it out
jim stands at his own back door beaten and ashamed
he lifts a hand and knocks
after a moment the door opens and there is diane
diane looks at jim in silence
her face reveals nothing but there is a deadness in her eyes
after a moment she turns back inside leaving the door open
jim follows his wife inside closes the door
the camera moves to peek in the kitchen window from where we watch jim and diane but cannot make out anything they say
i dont know how diane and i made it through that night but we did
our marriage had gone right to the brink but in the end i guess it was saved by one simple fact we truly loved each other
so we made a commitment to begin the painful process of piecing our lives back together
the worst was over the mistakes of the past were behind us
a waste basket peeks out from under jims desk
we hear a distinctive rhythmic squeak and a shadowy head appears in the window
the door opens and lowell turns on the lights
he approaches the waste basket and slides it out
from overhead jim circles the track
on the ground jim does pushups
then sit ups
the next day held the promise of a new beginning
after all what harm had really been done
no one was dead
now all clean and refreshed and whistling a merry tune jim pops in to check his box giving a wave to miss seeder
jim continues to whistle as he looks through his mail
life would go on and i would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience
walt needs to see you
still absorbed in his papers jim heads over to walts door
jim stops cold
walt is not alone
barbara flick and a bleary eyed tracy are there
so are larry fouch ron bell and lowell the janitor
prominently displayed on walts desk are two crinkled ballots
jim takes an eternal few seconds to absorb what is happening
mcallister i hope you can help us clear something up
look at his face
he knows hes been caught
look at his face
to jim your ass is grass mister
you said i was a liar youre the liar youre the larry you just take it easy all turn and stare at jim
come to think of it he does look awfully guilty
hoy leads the class in recitation
paul responds along with his companeros
el ella pierde
a student aide enters the classroom and hands a note to the teacher who upon reading the note looks up at paul senor presidente
the class laughs fondly
paul looks around beaming with embarrassment and pride
quieren verte en la oficina
paul walks down the hall a bounce in his step on this fine spring morning
yo soy senor presidente
el grande presidente
i dont know why but finding out there was a mistake and i hadnt won the election after all didnt bother me that much
winning had seemed kind of unreal anyway
i guess i should have voted for myself
paul reaches the int
school office continuous and enters walts office
everyone is there standing up take a seat son
weve got something hard to tell you
is tammy okay
its about the election
walt closes the door in our faces
we hold on the door
after paul got the bad news walt asked for a few minutes alone with me
it was very simple really
i offered my resignation and he accepted
very quietly it was all over for jim mcallister at millard high twelve years of hard work down the drain
the door opens revealing that only wait and jim remain
the office staff is hushed as jim the zombie cyclops emerges into the office and walks somberly toward miss boeder
his voice quavers at half volume
walt will be speaking with you about this but i need you to find someone to take over my classes
the lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer
im going home now
as jim moves toward the parking lot the school recedes in an odd rear projection that suggests he is floating
the music here reinforces the gravity of the moment the inevitability of his fate
jim stops walking and a disembodied steeping wheel floats into his hands
the scene behind changes to the city passing by outside is another strange rear projection
jim grips the floating steering wheel and makes turns wildly out of sync with the background
i dont remember driving home or much of anything that happened in the next few days
jim lets go of the steering wheel and it drifts away
jim turns his back to camera to face jim drifts toward his house and it absorbs him through the front door
were no longer in rear projection land reality has caught up with jim
as he walks across the room he strips off his shirt shoes socks and finally pants
left only in his underwear he walks through the house and out into the ext
mcallister backyard day and flops down in the grass facing the sky
there were news stories in the paper and on television former students calling with their support endless hours of doing nothing thinking nothing
a shadow falls over jims face and a hand offers him a glass of iced tea
grateful jim takes it and looks up at diane her head blocking the sun
diane stood by me through the entire humiliating ordeal in a way it sort of evened things out between us
jim looks up at the sky
soon school was over and summer stretched out in front of me as it always had
funny how the rhythm of the school year remains ingrained in you for life
in mid june we found out diane was pregnant
under black we hear the opening bars of a bouncy tijuana brass song
twisting to the music at a party a giant grin on his face a big sombrero with tassels on his head
behind him we can see an enormous illuminated gravel conveyor
super imposed one year later
senior year was great i sure i didnt get to play ball or be president but i got elected homecoming king and prom king anyway
i got into nebraska like i wanted and early rushed phi delts
at the end of the year me and my buddies threw a hitching mexican party down at the cement plant
shit that was a good party
that was a good party
paul is at a keg pumping it up and serving himself a beer
he takes a sip seems to grow pensive
the only really bad thing about senior year was lisa
right before christmas she dumped me
one minute shes totally in love with me and then boom shes going out with my football buddy randy
paul looks over at lisa dancing suggestively with randy paul looks sad takes another gulp waves at unseen friends
sometimes i wonder what wouldve happened if id actually won the election
maybe my whole life would be different
like i might never have gone to yosemite with greg and travis
paul takes a big gulp and looks into camera
or maybe id be dead
under black we hear a distinctive airy hiss
tammy takes a big toke off a joint
catholic school was great
tammy and jennifer a sacred heart schoolmate are jammed into a bathroom stall
i mean the teachers kind of sucked and they were supposedly way more strict but you could get away with murder
tammy hands off the doob to jennifer who takes a huge hit
the best thing about sacred heart was meeting jennifer
jennifer looks at tammy
tammy looks at jennifer accompanied by the early s song jennifer
super style glimpses of tammy and jennifer in the sacred heart hallways jennifer in the park jennifer dancing in tammys room and finally jennifer all those feelings i had for
lisa were just preparing me for the real thing
jennifer and i are soul mates and were never ever ever going to be apart
we hear the murmur of a small crowd interrupted by the bang bang bang of a gavel
senior year was very productive for me and full of personal achievement
tracy officiates a meeting
next to her at the head table is jerry raynor and other council members
order i can we vote on this
those in favor
on top of a very successful student council year i got into cornell like i wanted with scholarships and i was in the top th percentile of my graduating class
tracy approved tracy walks along the edge of a pond on this overcast day her arms are crossed and she wears an oversized woolen sweater
wind blows softly through her hair
but sometimes i got lonely and id think about dave
i missed our talks
maybe it could have worked out between us
i dont know
wearing the red vest and ask me button of a real valu foot soldier dave stands above a case of spray paint
he is stamping prices on every cap
i wonder what hes doing now
maybe he finally finished his novel its annual distribution time and crowd of excited students are lined up to get their precious book of memories
many have already received theirs and are crowded around dining tables gleefully exchanging bans mots
tracy takes her annual and quickly opens it to the index
close on tracts name followed by a whopping list of page references when the yearbooks came out i was on almost every page
tracy walks outside hugging her yearbook and sees paul at his truck surrounded by supplicants
tracy stops for a moment and watches
she gathers her courage and heads toward him
paul doesnt even notice her so occupied is he with his friends and admirers
paul will you sign my yearbook
paul takes the book efficiently finds the page with his picture and goes to work
can i sign yours too
oh yeah sure
to a friend hey nolan give my book to tracy when youre done nolan finishes and hands the book over
tracy turns to the front pages and finds them completely filled as are the end pages
now she looks for her picture
when she finds it its almost completely obscured by part of some asswipe s long illegible exclamation point filled message
finally she locates an available space and begins to write
i thought very carefully about what to write
because despite everything that had happened with the election i really wished him well
i even signed it
close on tracy writing love tracy beneath her inscription tracy takes pauls book back to him
hes already working on another annual and barely looks up when he swaps with her
tracy starts to walk away and paul stops her hey tracy i
she turns around expectantly yes paul
have a great summer
and good luck at college
genuinely moved thanks
it was great working with you
tracy opens the book as she walks and stops when she finds an almost blank page with pauls puny inscription at the bottom have a great summer
good luck at college paul metzier tracy looks at herself in a mirror as though dispassionately assessing her own face
then she begins to put on lipstick
after graduation i dont know
somehow felt empty inside
i guess high school just seemed so meaningless now and i couldnt wait to get out of omaha
next year i was going to make all new friends
smarter more ambitious friends
it was time to move on
there was nothing left for roe here
i just had one more thing to take care of
under black comes the sound of a busy commercial street
after two months of sitting on my ass and two months helping out at my brother in laws travel agency
a standard issue car dealership banner draped lot glass enclosed showroom
i landed a position at a saturn dealership
all those cars and that new car smell in his cubicle jim is typing at his desk across from a ish male i never thought id end up selling cars
but its not so bad
i like the saturn philosophy it really is a different kind of company
a framed snapshot on jims desk shows diane and him with the little im just relieved to have a steady income now that there are three of us
outside on the lot jim saunters toward a client reading stickers
inside the dealership jim explains features of a cross sectioned the client is in a drivers seat while jim leans in from the opposite window pointing out dashboard features
actually it wasnt so difficult making the transition from teaching to selling
its like i tell my customers my role is just to educate people so they can make informed decisions
the glass doors to the showroom open and jim watches a satisfied customer drive slowly away in a new saturn twin cam
when i send someone home with a new unit i feel a genuine sense of pride
the room consists of mismatched sofas and chairs around a coffee table
theres a tv that no one watches
sleeves rolled up and tie loosened jim eats a sandwich next to two other salesmen and a female accountant who like him are eating lunch and watching tv
no one speaks
so thats about it
maybe ill get back to teaching someday but for the time being i guess im pretty happy where im at
a salesman pokes his head in the door
to jim hey professor
theres a young gal out here asking for you
oh jim chews quicker and wipes his mouth as he stands up straightens his tie
low as jim passes shes a real hot tamale
jim walks among the shiny new cars and sees the back of an attractive young woman in a red dress and heels
she turns around its tracy
jim is truly surprised
jim waits for tracy to lead the way but she doesnt so what brings you here
im looking at new cars
well you came to the right place my mothers buying me a new car for college
where are you going
where d you get into
well i got in everywhere i applied but cornell is my first choice
good for you
good for you an uncomfortable pause
jim shifts gears
so are you looking for something sporty or more practical
a test drive
jim is in the passenger seat
tracy nears the end of the dealerships driveway
anywhere you want
checks his watch just so long as were not gone more than a half hour
tracy turns right
they drive a moment in silence
handles pretty good dont you think
plenty of pep too
and this model comes with abs and dual air bags standard
that sounds good
a silence so tracy
why are you doing this
coming to see me
are you trying to
i just thought
l mean i am looking for a new car
but i just thought well im going away soon and youll be stuck here and i dont know i just think maybe if things had been different we might have
been well friends
and then things would be different
dont you think
jim just looks at tracy its so very odd well i
thats very nice of you
excited ive got an idea
tracy suddenly signals and takes a right
tracy and jim and the saturn zoom by
tracy takes a corner and pulls to a stop in front of a modest middle class house
tracy sets the parking brake
jims eyes register a suppressed panic
i dont understand
whats the deal
tracy looks deeply into jims eyes
i want you to do something for me
swallows unsure what heaven or hell awaits him
getting out i just have to get something
ill be right back
tracy heads toward the house
jim sits and waits
he scans tracys house notices the chipped and peeling paint the rusting lawn furniture the bowed porch steps
now tracy opens the door and gets in
she carries her yearbook and gives it to jim
oh is this
thumbing through it god
first one of these i havent been in for a long time
would you sign it for me
tracy reaches over the parking brake and flips the yearbook to the blank pages at the beginning
what a surprise
take as much room as you want jim removes a pen from his breast pocket and uncaps it
he considers what to write
im scared mr
i kind of dont feel ready for college
youll be fine
i hope so you will
he looks at the yearbook
he looks at tracy
he looks out the windshield
its all so odd
