href b b ferris buellers day off by john hughes by john hughes july wheres my wallet
whispers sadistic when you turn ten your heads going to swell up real big like a watermelon and were going to have to put you to sleep like they do
with a dog
is my head going to swell up
screams the house falls dead silent
we hear footsteps thundering through the house
a tense strain of music fades up
you heads starting to swell up
we hear the sound of toms footsteps running through the kitchen down the hall up the stairs up the hallway
a door open
breathless whats the matter
worried its ferris
snaps whats wrong
for christs sake
look at him
an eighteen year old boy
hes staring lifelessly at camera
his mouths open
his eyes are bugged out
his tongue is fat and dry in his mouth
hes laying in bed on his side
ferris parents tom and joyce bueller are standing at bedside
theyre in their late forties early fifties
handsome upper middle class parents
theyre both dressed for work
he doesnt have a fever
but he says his stomach hurts and hes seeing spots
his lifeless eyes blink
tom bends down and touches ferris forehead
whats the matter ferris
feel his hands
theyre cold and clammy
tom takes one of ferris hands
discreetly should you call the doctor
whispers he doesnt want me to
why dont you want mom to call the doctor
ferris exhales loudly
he tries to speak but all he can manage is a choked gasp
ferris tries again
raspy dont make a fuss
ill get up
he starts to get up
joyce gently pushes him back down
i have a test today
i have to take it
i want to get into a good college so i can have a fruitful life
youre not going to school like this
to tom maybe i should call the office and tell them i wont be in
im okay mom
i feel perfectly
hes gripped by a seizure
his body stiffens and he chokes
his older sister jeanie walks into the room
shes dressed for school
shes cute and stuck up
a major pill
whats his problem
he doesnt feel well
dry that one out and you can fertilize the lawn
thats enough jeanie
youre not falling for this are you
tell me youre not falling for this
is that jeanie
i cant see that far
pucker up and squat ferris
annoyed thank you jeanie
get to school
angry defeated youre really letting him stay home
i cant believe this
if i was bleeding out my eyes you guysd make me go to school
its so unfair
please dont be upset with me jeanie
be thankful that youre fit and have your health
to herself oh i wanna puke
she glares at ferris
her eyes are mascara and vengence
she slips out of the room
ferris brother todd and sister kimberly peek into the room
get your stuff
daddyll be right down
that would be a huge family embarrassment
if he dies i got dibs on his stereo
she turns sharply and exits
does my head look alright
just answer me one question
is it swelling up
kim said it was going to get as big as
yells out the room shut up
todd backs out of the room
ill be okay
ill just sleep
maybe ill have an aspirin around noon
to ferris im showing houses to the family from california today but ill be in the area
my officell know where i am if you need me
ill check it with you too
its nice to know i have such loving caring parents
youre both very special people
he acknowledges tom with a pathetic flutter of his eyelids
she strokes ferris hair
i hope you feel better pumpkin
she leans down and kisses his forehead
tom pats his shoulder
get some rest
ferris lets out a wheeze
his glassy eyes follow his parents to the door
we love you sweetie
call if you need us
they close the door
the lock clicks
ferris eyes shift from the door to camera
a sly little smile crawls across his lips
they bought it
the mtv theme music roars in
the tv at the foot of ferris bed
the mtv logo is playing
ferris yanks open the drapes
the pall of the sickroom disappears in the brilliant glow of morning sunlight
one of the worst performances of my career and they never doubted it for a second
looks out the window what a beautiful day
he turns from the window
parents always fall for the clammy hands
its physical evidence of illness
its a good non specific symptom
parents are generally pretty hip to the fever scams
and to make them work you have to go a hundred and one hundred and two
you get a nervous mother and you end up in a doctors office and thats worse than school
he flips on his stereo and fills the room with the mtv broadcast
a new song begins
fake a stomach cramp and when youre doubled over moaning and wailing just lick your palms
its a little stupid and childish but then so if high school
he equalizes the sound a little
this is my ninth sick day with semester
if i go for ten im probably going to have to barf up a lung
so i absolutely must make this one count
he exits into the hallway
ferris walks into the bathroom
its littered with jeans debris
he turns on the shower water
i dont care if youre fifty five or seven everybody needs a day off now and then
its a beautiful day
how can i be expected to handle high school
he bends down out of frame as he loses his briefs
he pops up
i do actually have a test
that wasnt bullshit
he steps into the shower
through the pebbled glass of the shower door we see ferris outline
that i care about it was
inside the shower
ferris hair is standing straight up
its moulded into a fin with shampoo
its on european socialism
i mean really
whats the point
im not european
i dont plan to be european
so who gives a shit if theyre socialists
they could be fascist anarchists and it still wouldnt change the fact that i dont own a car
he turns the shower head around and uses it like a microphone
sings ferris comes out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around his waist
hes drying his hair with another of a different color
not that i condone fascism
or and isms
isms in my opinion are not good
a person should not believe in an ism
he should believe in himself
john lennon said it on his first solo album
i dont believe in beatles i just believe in me
a good point there
afterall he was the walrus
he opens a linen closet and tosses the towel in it
i could be the walrus and id still have to bum rides off people
he passes camera and goes into his room
im not very political
let me put that into perspective
ferris tosses the towel hes dried hair with on the bed
my uncle went to canada to protest the war right
on the fourth of july he was down with my aunt and he got drunk and told my dad he felt guilty he didnt fight in viet nam
so i said whats the deal uncle jeff
in wartime you want to be a pacifist and in peacetime you want to be a soldier
it took you twenty years to find out you dont believe in anything
snaps his fingers grounded
just like that
pause be careful when you deal with old hippies
they can be real touchy
he opens his door
the door opens and ferris rifles through his shirts
my mother was a hippie
but she lost it
she got old
if she listens to the white album now
she doesnt hear music she hears memories
nostalgia is her favorite drug
itll probably be mine too
i hope not
he finds a shirt he likes
he steps back from the closet and puts it on
he drops the towel
he walks across the room to his dresser
he opens his underwear drawer
theres an old model of a submarine on the top of the dresser
he picks it up
in eighth grade a friend of mine made a bong out of one of these
the smoke tasted like glue
he pulls out a pair of underwear
he gets dressed as he speaks
his name is garth volbeck
hes a serious outsider
not a bad guy i like him
im probably his only friend
i do what i can for him
i mean if i was him id appreciate it
do unto others right
anyway his mother owns a gas station
his fathers dead and his sisters rumored to be a prostitute which is complete bullshit
she only puts out so people will hang out with her
its sad but i dont hold it against her
better to hold it against the guys who use her and dont care about her
pause my parents never allowed garth over here
it was because of his family
mainly his older brother
hes in jail
i could see them not wanting his brother here because he is a registered psycho
i wouldnt want him here
i once watched the guy eat a whole bowl of artificial fruit just so he could see what it was like to have his stomach pumped
but garth isnt his brother
it isnt his fault that his brothers screwed up
alot of fights with the parents on that point
i always felt for garth
i was sleeping at his house once and i was laying on the dark worrying that his brother was going to come in and hack me to death with an
ax and i heard garth crying
i asked him what was wrong and he said nothing
nothing was wrong
there was no specific thing he was crying about
in fact he wasnt really even aware that he was crying
he just cried himself to sleep every night
it was a habit
the guys so conditioned to grief that if he doesnt feel it he cant sleep
how could you possibly dump on guy who has to deal with that kinda shit
my parents acknowledge the trudge of the situation and im sure that deep down they do feel for him but still the guys banned from our house
he looks at himself in the mirror on the back of his closet door
he doesnt like what hes wearing
he continues his speech as he disrobes
unfortunately now my parents have a legit argument
garth doesnt need his brother to give him a rep anymore
hes getting one on his own
its over for him
gone from school
gone from life
his legacy is a gas station
ferris comes down the stairs
hes wearing a completely different outfit
one very serious danger is playing sick is that its possible to believe your own act
ferris comes into the kitchen and crosses to the refrigerator
that and boredom
alot of people ditch and feel great for about an hour
then they realize theres nothing to do
tv and food
i myself have ditched and gotten so bored i did homework
figure that shit out
he takes a sip out of a bottle of orange juice
you have to plan things out before you take the day off
otherwise you get all nervous worrying about what to do and all you get is grief and the whole point is to take it easy cut loose and enjoy
he crosses to the pantry
you blow your day and at about three oclock when everybodys out of school youre going to wish youd gone to school so you could be out having fun
he emerges from the pantry with a handful of oreos
avoid the misery
plan your day
do it right
ferris walks in and flops down in an armchair
theres alot of pressure at work in my age group
and its not always recognized
he reaches over and picks up the telephone
he sets it in his lap
some guy whose hair is falling out and his stomachs hanging over his belt and everything he eats makes him fart he looks at someone like me and thinks this
kids young and strong and has a full rich future ahead of him whats he got to bitch about
he punches out a number
he remote controls the tv on
thats just one reason why i need a day off every now and then
a sleek modern house on a couple of deeply wooded acres
a prime house in a prime location
a telephone rings over
its a dark dreary sick room
shades drawn floor strewn with used tissues nightstand a still life of over the counter remedies
a high school boy cameron frye is laying in bed
we dont see his face only a silhouette with a thermometer sticking out his mouth
u s sunday bloody sunday is playing
hes mumbling random words
the phone rings
his hand reaches back and hits the speaker phone button
how do you feel
is your mother in the room
cameron takes the thermometer out of his mouth
shes not home
where are you
ferris is sprawled out in the chair
im taking the day off
get dressed and come over
its all in your head
come on over
i feel like complete shit ferris
i cant go anywhere
im sorry to hear that
now come on over and pick me up
cameron slowly hangs up the phone
the phone rings again
cameron hits the speaker button
youre not dying
you just cant think of anything good to do
ferris hangs up
if anybody needs a day off its cameron
he has alot of things to sort out before he graduates
he cant be wound this tight and go to college
his roommatell kill him
ive come close myself
but i like him
hes a little easier to take when you know why hes like he is
the boy cannot relax
pardon by french but cameron is so tight that if you stuck a lump of coal up his ass in two weeks youd have a diamond
after thought and cameron would worry that hed owe taxes on it
we hear roll call as camera moves across the tile floor
a shoes pov
camera enters a classroom
it travels past a teachers hush puppies and heads up an aisle of desk past dirty yellow reebocks rotting air jordans scuffed heels pristine loafers
camera reaches the last desk and rises slowly to reveal that its empty
pause my best friends sisters boyfriends brothers girlfriend heard from this guy who knows this kid whos going with a girl who saw ferris pass out at flavors last night
i guess its pretty serious
weary thank you simone
cheery no problem whatsoever
the road warrior is playing on video cassette
the big chase at the end
hes sitting in the arm chair pretending its humongous war wagon
hes wearing a hockey mash
he reaches down and grabs an imaginary nitrous oxide valve
humongous reaches down and grabs a real nitrous oxide valve
he gives it a twist
he throws himself back against the chair
the force of the rapid acceleration of his vehicle throws humongous back in his seat
he bounces himself in the chair to simulate the bumpy high speed ride
the was wagon hurtles down the road
he rears back in horror
the war wagon is heading for a head on collision with the tanker truck
arms outstretched head thrown back braced for collision
outside a bedroom window
a flowering crabtree branch
petite pink flowers
we pull back from the window into the room
its jeanies room
a pink and powder blue pig pen
clothes everywhere make up books records
ferris is sitting on her bed going through a purse
this is really degrading
he comes up with a crumpled dollar bill
financing my activities this way
very damaging to the self image
but hey im broke
in times of crisis one must to what one must to
ill pay it back
he comes up with a five
regardless of how much shit sisters make you eat how often they rat on you how gross they act or how wicked and insensitive they can be you should not
because most likely they have cash and its usually very easy to get your hands on
he holds up a twenty and snaps it
pink floyds money the song plays as ferris digs through the sofa cushions
ferris extracts a sticky quarter from a crevice
ferris is going through his fathers pants pockets
another crumpled bill surfaces
a couple of stiff hard bleached singles that have gone through the wash lay on top of the washer
a hand scoops them up
an obvious gift from a grandparent
mint proof set
a ten a five and a single enclosed in a lucite frame
a screwdriver tip wedges between the two pieces of lucite and pops them apart
a hand peels the bills off the backing
hands ripping through the kitchen junk drawer
locating a dollar bill
the familiar blue collectors album
one by one the quarters are being popped out of their slots
the dusty dirty contents of the bag are emptied on the floor
fingers pick a dime out of a matted wad of filth
its being shaken furiously
its a childs card
its slowly opened to reveal a crisp new five
the door opens and ferris thrusts his hands into the pockets of the coats
he comes up with a ball of kleenex
a roll of tums
a squirt gun
then a modest wad of bills
his face lights up as he counts out the cash
he closes the door
ferris face appears between the bed and the floor
his arm reaches out for a small metal bank hidden under the bed
its on a work bench
an awl is driven in between the door and the jamb
it pries the door open
inside are trading cards a charred dolls head a zippo lighter and finally a five dollar bill
ferris is on his hands and knees under the kitchen table
ferris lifts the leg and removes a quarter thats been used to balance the table
ferris stands up and pockets the quarter
a shower of coins and bills rain down on the sheets
the a suburban realty company
a cute little building in town
joyce is behind a desk
across from her are two women
theyre also real estate agents
no ones going to consider a house with a black living room
not even those jerks from vermont
lets be realistic
volbecks dead set against putting any money into the house
joyces phone intercom buzzes
she take the call
her eyes open wide with alarm
oh my god
im so sorry
i completely forgot to call
a modern suburban high school
are you aware that your son is not in school today
its a passing period
the hall is clogged with students
yes i am
ferris is home sick
i had a meeting first thing this morning
i should have called
it completely slipped my mind
a secretary is at work at her desk
we hear the dean inside the office
are you also aware that ferris does not have what we consider an exemplary attendance record
it reads edward r
dead of students
the deans feet are up on the desk behind the sign
moderately priced dress shoes
i dont understand
i just had his file up
ed rooney is sitting behind his desk
hes tough clean and straight as an i beam
short neatly combed hair suit and tie
hes toying with a pencil
hes confident to the point of arrogance
i just has his file up mrs
behind him is a computer terminal
he removes his feet from the desk and turns in his swivel chair
if ferris thinks he coast this last month and still graduate hes sorely mistaken
this is all news to me
the monitor on rooneys desk displays ferris records
so far this semester alone hes been absent nine times
under days missed we see a number suddenly change to a number
rooney turns to the monitor
he reads off the screen
i have it right here in front of me
he looks closer at the screen
ferris is at his macintosh computer
he has his record up on the screen
i wanted a car
i got a computer
hows that for being born under a bad sign
shes still on the phone with rooney
i can give you every assurance that ferris is home and that he is in fact very ill
i debated whether or not i should even leave him
i can appreciate that at this time of year children are prone to taking the day off but in ferris case hes truly a very sick boy
the grille cloth is throbbing
the meters on the amplifier are totally in the danger zone
we see ferris in his room with a guitar around his neck
a home video camera is capturing ferris on tape
hes sitting on the edge of the bed buttoning his shirt
he sighs deeply and fall back on the bed
jeanie is at her locker during a passing period
a girlfriend comes up to her
im really sorry about your brother
whatre you sorry for
i have to live with the trouser snake
no i mean i heard hes really sick
who said hes sick
a whole bunch of people
they said hes like on the verge of death
jeanie stares incredulously at the girl
this guy in my biology class said that if ferris dies hes giving his eyes to stevie wonder
hes really sweet isnt he
she smiles and exits
jeanie cocks her head in bewilderment
she kicks her locker shut
hes in bed on the phone
a sample of my blood was sent to atlanta to the center for disease control
i dont know man im bricking heavily
point to the phone freshman
to the phone did you see alien
when the guy had the creature in his stomach
it feels like that
a freshman boy is on the pay phone
a couple of his buddies are standing at his side waiting anxiously for news
are you kidding
did you see alien
you never rented the video cassette
second boy shakes his head no
hes really wasted
to the second boy whos he talking to
you know him
hes getting me out of summer school
anyway i appreciate you letting us know how youre doing
we gotta split
to third boy shit
i hope he doesnt die
i cant handle summer school
the boy snatches a passing girl
did you see alien
he hands her the phone
pause hi ferris
hows your bod
jaw drops oh my god
is it serious
are you upset
rooneys comparing his computer monitor to hard copy
his secretary is standing over his shoulder
i dont trust this kid any further than i can throw him
with your bad knee you better not throw anybody ed
rooney stares at her for a long beat
whats so dangerous about a character like ferris bueller is that he gives the good kids bad ideas
the last thing i need at this point in my career is fifteen hundred ferris bueller disciples running around these halls
hes very popular ed
sportos motorheads geeks sluts pinheads dweebies wonkers richies they all adore him
thats exactly why i have to catch him this time
to show these kids that the example he sets is a first class ticket to nowhere
you sounded like dirty harry just now
rooney looks up at her with a proud smile
he unconsciously does an eastwood squint
its a glorious late spring day
a florists truck drives past the house
hes on the telephone
as he speaks he does a little macpainting on his macintosh
a modigliani nude
cameron if youre not over here in fifteen minutes you can find a new best friend
im serious man
this is bullshit making me wait around the house for you
camerons back in bed
i feel like shit
why cant you leave me alone
youre not up for some good times
its a beautiful day
its almost summer
if this was hawaii wed be surfing
hes growing weary of camerons wimpishness
you want to stay home and try to have the shits
try to barf
try to feel worse
i dont have to try
be a man
take some pepto bismol and get dressed
youre boring me with this stuff
the other phone line rings
squeeze you buns for a second
i got another call
he puts cameron on hold
he clears his throat and answers the second line
he sounds like hes on his last breath
h hell o
a lasalle street office tower
hes behind his desk
herman miller desk and chair
you sound miserable
i thought i was improving
were you sleeping
i was trying to do some homework
a closer view of the rude drawing ferris is making
im so worried about falling behind
he leans back from the monitor and sips a coke
can you hold on a second
are you alright
just a little phlegm on the phone
he puts his father on hold
its my dad
oh thats just great
are you busted
its completely cool
hes just checking up on me
now listen to me
im working on getting some heavy bucks out of him
so the least you can do is hurry up and get over here
he disconnects and gets his father back
he switches back to his sick voice
the moment before you called i had a chest spasm and i blew lung fluid all over the place
it was making me ill looking at it
but gee its sure great of you to call
im sure therere alot of fathers who wouldnt take time out from their busy schedules to call a dumb sick teenager
hey pal what was i supposed to do
ferris reaches out and hits a key on his computer
the screen dumps the drawing
give yourself some credit dad
it was a mammoth gesture
its like those savings bonds you used to give me every christmas
looks at camera and smiles it was that kind of concern
a message is flashing transmitting data
he turns away from the computer and puts his feet up on the desk
he lights a cigarette
you had to work hard for the money to buy those things right
not any harder than anybody else
ferris mouths toms words as he says them
ferris drawing suddenly appears on the billboard
pedestrians stop to look
he blows a smoke ring
you work so hard ill bet you dont even remember where those bonds are right
ferris points a finger in the air as a cue to his father
youre pulling my leg
youre just trying to cheer me up
like hell i am
theyre in a shoebox in my closet
he looks at camera
hes gotten exactly what he wants
to camera normal voice was that a class move or what
the guy gave it up faster than a drunk catholic girl
i hope my kids dont pull this shit on me
thinks of course if they didnt theyd be dumb and abnormal and theyd probably never move out of my house and id have to support them until i die
i take it back
to the phone sick voice dad
all this talking has made me kind of light headed
i think i better lie down
you take care
ill call you after lunch
you dont have to dad
i want to
he hangs up
you win some you lose some
he turns his desk chair around and gets up
im so disappointed in cameron
twenty bucks says hes sitting in his car debating about whether or not he should go out
hes sitting behind the wheel of his car
were gonna get caught
no doubt about it
he cuts the engine
im not doing it
he sits for half a beat
hell keep calling until i come over
he sighs and restarts the engine
actually whatll happen is ill get caught
he stops the engine
a crash of horror music
hands curl around the drawer pulls
the drawer is opened slowly ominously
the hands lift a sweater out
a heraldic sting as we see a mens magazine beneath the sweater
he takes out the magazine
he leafs through the pages for the pictorials as he speaks
cameronll go on like that for a good thirty minutes
the guy is a shellfish when it comes to making a decision
the reason he doesnt fell good is he worries about everything
hes the only guy i know whos deeply concerned that when he grows up therell be a critical shortage of strategic metals
he exits the room
ferris comes out of his room and heads down the hallway
camerons also the only guy i know who knows what strategic metals are
waves the magazine pardon moi
he goes into the bathroom
we hear the toilet seat slam sings a stunningly beautiful girl sloane peterson is sitting at her desk in a history class
shes staring out the window as a tweedy male teacher delivers a dry dusty lecture
roosevelts health had seriously deteriorated by the time he met with churchill and stalin at yalta
sneezes pardon me
the classroom door opens and the school nurse walks in
for a moment the teacher thinks shes come in because she heard him sneeze
she crosses to him and whispers in his ear
she like the others watches the nurse curiously
the teachers face drops as hes delivered an obvious piece of disturbing news
he nods grimly to the nurse
she looks at the kids
sits up in her seat
shes a picture of compassion and understanding
may i see you outside for a moment
theres been an emergency
a smile curls across her lips
as she gathers her books she looks to the girl next to her
whispers dead grandmother
the nurse is gently holding sloanes hand
nods solemnly dead grandmother
he has a suspicious look on his face
rooneys at his desk
his secretary is standing across from him
thats what mr
i had florence sparrow notify sloane
whos this girls going with
its so hard to tell
i see her alot with ferris bueller
his suspicions are confirmed
could you get me mr
petersons daytime number
as the secretary starts out of the room rooneys phone rings
she stops and answers the desk phone
edward rooneys office
can you hold
she puts the call on hold
rooney is startled
he thinks for a beat then reaches for the phone
do you still want his number
rooney answers her with an annoyed look
she smiles and backs out
he punches the phone button
this is george peterson
how are you today sir
weve had a bit of bad luck this morning as you may have heard
rooney rolls his eyes
its so obvious its not mr
and gosh im all broken up
id be happy to release sloane
you produce a corpse and ill release sloane
i want to see this dead grandmother firsthand
the secretary stops cold in the doorway
she turns to rooney in horror
he covers the phone
whispers its ferris bueller
nervy litttle punk
im gonna set a trap and let his walk right into it
to phone thats right
cart the stiff in and ill turn over your daughter
its school policy
was this your mother
rooneys other line rings
she steps out of rooneys office and picks up the other line
ed rooneys office
her jaw drops
she puts the call on hold and hangs up
she hurried into rooneys office
rooneys chewing out the person on the other line
ill tell you want you dont like my policies you can just come on down and smooch by big old ugly ass
you hear me
the secretary comes in
shes waving her arms furiously
rooney tries to wave her away
she stomps her foot
rooney covers the phone
ferris buellers on line two
it freezes in mid tap
the pencils falls from his fingers
a mask of horror
he glances at the phone
the second line light is flashing
he blinks cocks his head twitches
hes zipping his pants fastening his belt
the phones cradled against his shoulder
he speaks in the same voice he used on his father
im sorry to disturb you at work but i was wondering if it would be possible for my sister to bring home any assignments from my classes that i may
hes staring blankly ahead
thank you sir
rooneys finger gingerly presses the button on the waiting call
he winces as he returns to the first call
camerons on the phone in the kitchen
hes doing a deep phoney father voice
you oughta be sorry for christs sake
a family member dies and you insult me
whats the matter with you anyway
he apologies profusely to cameron
hes perspiring trembling
i dont know
i thought you were someone else
you have to know sir that i would never deliberately insult you
i cant begin to tell you how embarrassed i am
pardon my french but youre an asshole
rooney nods enthusiastically
i most certainly am
cameron lays into rooney
this isnt over yet buster
you just make sure my daughters out in front of the school in ten minutes
do you read me
load and clear mr
call me sir goddamn it
ferris strolls into the kitchen to catch the last of the conversation
cameron covers the phone
to ferris im scared shitless ferris
what is rooney guesses my voice
youre doing great
cameron sighs and goes back to the phone
clears his throat i dont have all day to bark at you so ill make this short and sweet
ferris gives cameron an enthusiastic thumbs up
cameron smiles proudly
i want my daughter out in front of the school in ten minutes
i dons want anyone around
ferris smacks cameron
hes said the wrong thing
he covers the phone
whatd i do
out in front my herself
its too suspicious
hell think somethings up moron
he holds the phone out to ferris
you do it
ferris waves his arms angrily
cameron takes a deep breath
he clears his throat and puts on his fathers voice
i changed my mind fella
you be out in front with her
i wanna have a few words with you
ferris slaps cameron
the phone flies out of his hand
he winces as the phone hits the floor with a loud clonk
we hear the boys scrambling to pick up the phone then on second thought i dont have time to talk to you
well get together soon and have lunch
we hear a slap and the call disconnects
camerons rubbing the side of his head
whyd you hit me
wheres your brain
whyd you hit me
wheres your brain
whyd you hit me
wheres your brain
i asked you first
how can we pick up sloane if rooneys going to be there with her
i said for her to be there alone and you freaked
my god youre so stupid
aside i didnt hit you i lightly slapped you
you hit me
look dont ask me to participate in your crap if you dont like the way i do it
ferris is incredulous at camerons stupidity
camerons anger is intensified by his embarrassment
i was home sick
you get me out of bed being me over here make me jeopardize my future make me do a phoney phone call on a dean of students a man who
could squeeze my nuts into oblivion and then you deliberately hurt my feelings
i didnt deliberately hurt your feelings
cameron glares at ferris
have a nice life
he turns and heads out of the room
stick it up your ass ferris
cameron im sorry
i didnt mean to jam you
it was uncalled for
he turns around
he appreciates ferris apology
you did screw up through right
not that is was necessarily all you fault
to fix this situation im going to have to ask you for a small favor
camerons jaw drops
the door opens slowly dramatically as we hear a heraldic fanfare
light streams in to reveal cameron and ferris looking at the car
ferris is smiling with excitement and awe
cameron is frowning with trepidation and fear
the prancing black stallion
we move up from the stallion to the erotic red hood of a ferrari gts california
camerons face is ashen
the end of the world is at hand
ferris is in heaven
grim monotone ferrari gts california
less than a hundred were made
it has a market value of
my father spent three years restoring it
it is joy it is his love it is his passion
it is his fault he didnt lock the garage
ferris my father loves this car more than life itself
we cant take is out
a man with priorities so far out of whack doesnt deserve such a fine automobile
he never drives it ferris
he just rubs it with a diaper
we cant pick up sloane in your car cameron
rooneyd never believe mr
peterson drives that piece of shit
its not a piece of shit
its a piece of shit
dont worry about it
i dont even have a piece of shit
i have to envy yours
look im sorry but theres nothing else we can do
he knows the mileage ferris
he has it tatooed on his wrist
he doesnt trust you
alright look this is real simple
he puts his arm around cameron
whatever miles we put on it well take off
big proud smile well drive home backwards
cameron shakes his head no
im putting my foot down ferris
youll have to think of something else
camerons protests are drowned out by the distinctive roar of the twelve cylinders
youre not talking me into this one
i have to live with the man
im sorry but
the roar of the engine is overtaken by the sound of a crowded school hallway
she comes out of a classroom
she stops as sloane and rooney walk past
sloane has her coat on and shes carrying her books
jeanie watches her suspiciously
the ferrari is parked out in front
the top is down
ferris is driving
hes wearing a mans hat and sunglasses
camerons in the back
are you crazy
put the top back up
this is perfect top down weather
what about rooney
cameron the more obvious we are the less likely we are to get caught
that makes no sense whatsoever
the adult mind is a suspicious machine
look around at cameron stay down man
cameron squeezes himself lower
howcome its my dads car and im taking all the risk and i have to ride back here
i dont have an explanation
rooney and sloane come out the door
once again let me say how deeply saddened i am by your loss
were you close to your grandmother
she was a terrific lady
sloane looks across at the ferrari
ferris is looking out across the roof of the ferrari
hes careful to keep his nose and mouth below the roofline
hurry along now
sloane smiles and bids rooney a hasty farewell
i guess thats my dad
she hurries to the car
rooney watches her
something does compute for him
shes watching out the door
she sees the ferrari pull away
he cant quite put his finger on whats bothering him
sloane shrieks with delight
she leans across the console and gives ferris a kiss
this is so great
i cant believe it
right in front of rooney
she laughs and turns to cameron
what a fabulous car
enjoy it quick
it s going home
it was risky it was bold but it was totally necessary
whatre we gonna do
the question isnt what are we gonna do the question is what arent we going to do
dont tell me were not going to take the car home
to camera if you had access to a car like this would you take it back right away
would you give up feeling like a ton just to ease your best friends tension
either would i
it accelerates away like a shot
a fresh modern bank building
the clock outside read
the ferrari pulls into the parking lot
ferris cameron and sloane walk in
ferris is cocky and confident
sloanes still intoxicated with her freedom
camerons having stomach trouble
ferris leads the way to an open teller window
a woman about seventy with a silver blue beehive
its about four inches higher the highest beehive youre ever seen
as she moves the beehive hits a small sign over her head
shes been at the bank since they opened
she smiles when she sees ferris
hes at the window
on either shoulder are cameron and sloane
how are you
she pats the rock solid mass of blue hair
in doing so she locates a missing ball point pen
she withdraws it from the hair and smiles at its reappearance
i passed a kidney stone tuesday so im a little pooped but other than that im as chipper as can be
something occurs to her say should you be in school
he lays his savings bonds on the counter
polite laugh im out of school mrs
this is my wife
sloane suppresses a laugh
to cameron and this is my brother in law zz top
zz this is mrs
cameron isnt amused
to cameron is top a slavic name
id like to cash these in please
were having a baby and we need the cash for a crib clothes diapers food pellets leash water dish
froeling takes the bonds with a hearty smile
the latter part of the conversation sails over her like a line drive
to sloane you must be so excited
cameron groans and turns away from the sham
im thrilled maam
im especially looking forward to wearing those jeans with the stretch panel in front
froeling thumbs through the bonds
are you hoping for a boy or a girl
actually were hoping for a car
hes spooked by the games playing
he scans the bank nervously
he blinks focuses blinks again
joyce is with a middle aged couple and their bored sour puss teenage son boyd
hes sitting in a chair with his legs slung over the sides waving a bic lighter back and forth across his rump
the parents are joyces clients from vermont
a loan officer is discussing the local financing situation with them
his is an open office adjacent to the teller windows
joyces back is to the tellers
its like hes just witnesses an ax murder
her back is to the teller windows
shes conducting her meeting
behind her we see cameron grab ferris and point her out to him
cameron slaps his arm
froeling shows ferris the savings bonds
these bonds arent mature
if you hold onto them another two years youll get an additional four dollars
im aware of that
youre throwing away four dollars
no maam im giving it to the government
they need it
do you know what an aircraft carriers going for these days
she concludes her meeting
she shakes hands with the loan officer and stands
the vermont couple stands
boyd scrapes the bottom of his shoe on the desk leaving a glob of mud behind and he stands
joyce turns into the bank
ferris cameron and sloane are gone
she escorts her customers out
joyce and the vermont couple approach the doors
boyd lays a luggie in the drinking fountain
froeling passes with the savings bonds
she stops when she sees joyce
froeling how are you
i passed a kidney stone tuesday
shifts gears to joyce say you must be very proud
joyce doesnt know what shes talking about
whispers i met madonna
she pats joyce on the arm
she told me everything
keep me posted ill want to send a gift
she toodles on her way
joyce and the vermont couple are completely baffled
joyce and the vermont couple walk along the side of the bank heading for the parking lot
boyds tagging along behind
he picks up a stone and hurls it into the parking lot
my sons home sick today
if you wouldnt mind on our way back to the office id like to just run in and check up on him
we hear a metallic ping
as boyds missle hits a car
they pass a show window
as they pass we hold on the window
its promoting saving for college educations
a mannequin father is congratulating his mannequin son in a mortar and gown as a stiff sloane ferris and cameron look on proudly
his secretary is dialing a number for him
this is the petersons home
she hands the phone to rooney
watch your mouth this time
rooney glares at her
ferris buellers behind this
theres no doubt in my mind
thats what i was saying this morning
why he has to be stopped
hes got sloane peterson involved in this thing now
the secretary nods
and her grandmother too
it clicks on
we hear a grieved womans voice
it sounds an awful lot like sloane
we cant come to the phone right now
weve had a death in the family
if you need to reach us well be at the following number
rooney quickly takes down a number
his answering machine clicks on
we hear camerons voice
you have reached the coughlin bros
we are unable to come to the phone right now but if youll leave your name and number
rooney hangs up the phone
somethings going on goddamn it
the secretarys looking at a newspaper on rooneys desk
shes not listening to him
theres a railroad strike
and im going to stop it
my brother in lawll appreciate it
rooney looks at her puzzled
my brother in law rides the train to work
rooney stares at her like shes crazy
who gives a good goddamn
the major thoroughfare into the city of chicago from the suburbs
the ferrari streaks past
in the distance we see the sears tower the hancock building and the standard oil building
jeanies walking down the hall
shes stopped by a kid with a coke can
were collecting money to buy ferris bueller a new kidney
jeanie stares at him
shes flabbergasted at the proportions her brothers scan has reached
they run about fifty gs so it you could help out
go piss up a flagpole
she knocks the can out of his hands and storms down the hall
the kid yells after her
some day you might need a favor from ferris bueller
then wherell you be
he reaches for the can
the ferrari pulls into a large parking garage
ferris sloane and cameron get out
camerons having fits
we cant leave the car here
because we cant
i want it back home where it belongs
what could happen to it
it could get stolen wrecked scratched you name it
ill give the guy a five to watch it
he smiles with relish at the car
an iq that equals his hourly wage
shoulder length hair stuffed into a hairnet gold teeth
the attendant swaggers over to the car
ferris slips him a give
you speak english
since i was three
i want to you take extra special care of this vehicle okay
he pats the attendant on the arm
like its a beautiful woman
i appreciate it
the attendant very gingerly gets into the car
ferris turns to cameron
the ferrari pulls into the lot very slowly very carefully
no squealing tires no revving engine
see what a finski can do to a persons attitude
hes going to treat it like a beautiful woman
whip it with a stick and piss on the hood
oh please cameron
do you have to be so graphic
she heads down the street
this is so right
ferris nudges cameron on
they exit the garage and head after sloane
a long beat and the ferrari creeps down the exit ramp of the garage
its gone in the entrance and out the exit
another attendant jumps in the passenger side
hes skinny tall with a huge knit hat willed with dreads
he lets out a spirited laugh and the ferrari peels out of the lot
it heads down the street away from sloane ferris and cameron
joyces care pulls in the driveway
she gets out and heads up the house
theres a figure in the bed
we hear soft snoring
a wire runs from under the bed covers to the closet door to the door to the room itself
the wire is tied to the doorknob
downstairs we hear a door open and close
joyce quietly walks up the stairs
joyce comes up the stairs and crosses to ferris room
she listens at the door
we hear the snoring
joyce slowly turns the doorknob and pushes the door open a crack
the door opens and the figure like lump in the bed moves
she smiles and closes the door
the closet door is open
the wire from the bedroom door is strung over the top of the closet door
a trophy is attached to the end of the wire and its resting on a yard stick
as the bedroom door closes the trophy lifts up off the yardstick and the lump in the bed goes back down to its original position
little leds are lighting up to the rhythm of the snoring
the snoring it simulated
joyce listens at the door another beat
shes smiles with relief and affection
helicopter shot moves in on the worlds tallest building
as it passes we see three figures pressed against the windows
this is the worlds tallest building
from our vantage point here on the floor we are provided with a view of four states
do you think the cars alright
illinois michigan wisconsin and my personal favorite indiana
ferris cameron and sloane are standing against the window
i dont feel good ferris
are we gonna stay long
take a step back
ferris steps back
sloane and cameron follow suit
now lean against the glass
he leans forward putting all his weight on his forehead
and look down
sloane leans forward
cameron follows reluctantly
the street far far below
a dizzying view
the three are leaning against the glass
what if the glass gives
hes looking down
i think i see my dad
a middle aged man camerons father horace frye is standing on the street corner
hes lean clean tough and humorless
hes wearing a puzzled look on his face
i think i see my car
the ferrari screams down the avenue and disappears down the underground ramp
ferris and sloane bound down the escalator
cameron follows glumly
they dance past the giant calder mobile
ferris and sloane burst out the doors garnering the annoyed stares of the business people busily going in and out of the building
cameron politely waits his turn to exit
ferris and sloane head down the street
giant old monolith
traders are frantically buying and selling commodities
ferris cameron and sloane are sitting in the gallery watching the proceedings
do you love me
do you love me
i asked you first
would i trash a day of education to be with you if i didnt love you
would i risk damaging a deep and wonderfully enriching relationship with my parents if i didnt love you
would i have introduced you as my wife if i didnt love you
wait a minute
that was a lie
ferris puts his arm around sloane
would you want to get married
i mean if i wasnt an asshole
sloane stares at him
is he serious
ill do it if you will
cameron suddenly adds his two cents
you need a blood test
ferris looks around at him
if your bloods not compatible you could produce a pinhead
the state requires a blood test
so you cant get married today
if you get a blood test today
im not getting married
im with you babe
what do you mean why not
think about it
besides being too young and your father hating my guts and not having any place to live and feeling awkward about being the only cheer leader with a husband give
me a good reason why not
ill give you two
my mother and father
ferris and sloane look at him curiously
theyre married and they hate each other
to ferris youve seen them
am i right
youre fathers a toad and your moms always wired out but so what
it makes me puke
seeing people treat each other like that
its like the car
he loves the car
he hates his wife
my parents are divorced
its not like it doesnt happen ten thousand times a day
just because it happens doesnt make it right
are you comfortable with it
its not something i can get comfortable with
are yours divorced
they may as well be
do you think theyre staying together because of you
cameron hasnt seen it that way
do they like you
it hasnt occured to cameron that his parents might not like him
that parental love might not be a given
my father canned me and my brother and my mom for a twenty five year old dipso with fake tits
he dropped us like a rock
everything was cool at our house
i thought so
we all thought so
to camera this is all news to me
she keeps a pretty good secret
to cameron it was pure selfishness
when i have a kid i dont care how much i want something if its gonna screw up the kid forget it
to camera shes not lying
you could change
but im gonna try not to
im gonna think about it
im gonna try to prevent it
this is optomism
its a common trait with my age group
adults think its cute its like a charming quick that infests youth
but its a cool thing and i think deep down crusty old shits wish they had some
they wish they had her too
points to sloane sorry
id rather not have my family break apart thank you
well you know what
it aint up to you
its out of your hands
so i in other words i should just sit back and watch it crumble
youre merely an inhabitant in their universe
frightening choice of words
they call the shots
when you split from them you call the shots
so youre saying i should run away
shes saying its time for lunch
lets go feed cameron
they stand up and head out
ferris hangs back a moment
he cups his hands to his mouth
he yells at the top of his voice
and he exits
cool and casual
it explodes with activity in response to ferris shout
we hear a radio announcer
commodity prices rose sharply today in unusually heavy trading
a french restaurant on the gold coast
ferris sloane and cameron are standing in the restaurant
ferris is looking at the maitre ds reservations book
his fingers runs down to a party of three for
the maitred returns

im abe frohman
party of three for
the maitred looks at ferris curiously
is there a problem
youre abe frohman
im abe frohman
chuckles im sorry son

sloane tugs ferris sleeve
he ignores her
are you suggesting that im not who i say i am
shall i call the police
im not going anywhere
to the maitred call the police
grabs the phone ill call myself
sloane grits her teeth
the maitred smiles smuggly
ferris punches out a number
a beat and the restaurants second line lights up and the phone rings
the maitred motions for the phone so that he can answer the call
ferris waves him off angrily
you touch me and i yell rat
theres another phone around here
the maitred backs off
ferris lets split please
were gonna get busted
not a chance in the world
he hands the phone to sloane
ask for abe frohman
ferris sloane and cameron are seated in the restaurant
the maitred is hovering over ferris
i appreciate your understanding
dont grovel charles
just leave us to our repast and all will be forgotten
enjoy your luncheon
the maitred backs away
sloane is impressed
cameron is flushed with nerves
darling you were wonderful
oh but i had a wonderful teacher
cameron dear friend
cameron looks to ferris
and you thought we wouldnt have any fun
shame on you
ferris disappears behind his menu
we hear hallway sounds and jeanie
ferris buellers days are numbered
jeanies sitting on a bench in a field hockey uniform
shes talking to a friend
mean vicious im gonna bust his buns
whats the point
because im sick of the little dope
he manipulates my parents he does whatever he wants whenever he wants and he never gets nailed
wicked pause well babe today im the hammer
she yanks angrily on the velcro strap on her sneakers
the straps rip off in her hand
i think hes cute
sweetie its an established fact that you have no taste
ferris is not cute
hes not charming
hes not nice
hes not a wonderful person
hes an ignorant mule and the sooner everybody in this school comes to that realization the better off well all be
she displays the velcro straps to her friend
my brother strokes you you sympathize with him i get pissed off and this is what happens
jeanie tosses the straps on the floor
let me tell you something
i study hard i work hard im polite im considerate im friendly and fair to all kinds of people
i try to be everything a good decent person should be and you know what
everybody thinks youre an asshole
jeanie freezes with her next sentence pinned to her tongue
i dont think youre an asshole
her friend smiles sheepishly
jeanies friend shrugs wags her head does everything but verbally confirm
rachels a dirt bag
i dont know
just forget it
forget that everybody thinks im an asshole
would you like everybody to think youre an asshole
not everybody thinks youre an asshole
rooney likes you
a fat fifty year old clod with b
jeanie shakes her head in disbelief
would everybody be happier if maybe i were to die in a flaming car accident or something
maybe if you didnt cat like and asshole
am i acting like an asshole
i didnt mean it that way
i this a conspiracy to shit all over me or something
is my brother behind this

you really do have a problem jeanie
i have a problem
somebody who threatens to sock peoples tits has a problem
how about if i sock your face
jeanies friend gets up
take a walk jeanie
her friend exits
yells after her if it means anything to you i have my period
my bodys ridding she snarls and slumps against the lockers
hes monkey meat
ferris is standing at the urinal
shes a person who views life as an ordeal that must be endured
her body is a transport vehicle for her anger
i dont know where she gets this shit
basically the familys pretty cool
he looks down at the urinal
i wonder if everybody shoots at cigarette butts in urinals
probably not many women
continues i used to think that my family was the only one that had weirdness in it
it used to worry me
then i met cameron and i saw how his family functioned
he zips this trousers and steps away from the urinal
camerons home life is really shit
he wasnt lying
thats why hes sick all the time
it really upsets him
what he said about his parents hating each other
i refuse to sleep over at his house
his parents fight all the time
even when im there
is there anything worse than being at somebodys house when their parents are fighting
its the absolute height of social discomfort
he checks his hair in the mirror
when they go after each other cameron tightens up
he gets so wadded up you couldnt pry his buns apart with a crowbar
the thing with taking his old mans car
its good for him
it teaches him to deal with his fear
plus and i must be honest here i love driving it
i highly recommend picking one up
he exists the mens room
we hold a beat
a toilet flushes
another beat and tom walks out of the stall
he crosses to the sink
cameron and sloane have been served their lunches
theyre staring at the plates
what is it
i dont know
but it looks like its already been eaten and digested
i knew it was a mistake letting ferris order for us
ferris slides over to the table and drops into his seat
what are you doing
cameron looks at ferris
what is this shit
you got me
i dont speak french
he puts his napkin in his lap and smells his plate
i think its a land based beefoid creature
he takes a bite
he savors the taste
cameron and sloane try theirs
they chew tentatively
sloane and cameron shrug
its not bad
a waiter passes
ferris stops him
the waiter stops and looks at ferris indignantly
i have a growth on my brain that causes memory lapses
could you tell me what we ordered here
the waiter glances at the plates
and what might that be
as in the gland that has important functions in digestion and metabolism
they stop chewing
theyre holding their sweetbreads in their mouths
he continues his questioning
that secretes a thick colorless fluid containing digestive enzymes
the home of the world famous isles of langerhans
he nods broadly knowing that hes spoiling the kids meal
they look at each other
he pats his mouth with his napkin
he looks to cameron and sloane
he raises a finger holds it a beat and gives a cue
he turns away as sloane and cameron spit out their food
he watches sloane and cameron then glances at the waiter
tom and his two guests are standing at the curb talking
a cab is waiting
the doors open
in the b
ferris sloane and cameron come out of the restaurant
they approach the cab
toms back it to ferris
ferris stops cold
they turns on cue at tom now in the b
turns toward the restaurant
restaurants in the downtown area and i pick the one my father goes to
were gonna get nabbed for sure
no way cameron
only the meek get nabbed
the bold survive
he turns to the cab
sloane and cameron turn slowly
tom and his party are still jawing at curbside
ferris sloane and cameron slowly approach the cab
behind the backs of the men ferris scoots sloane into the cab
cameron dashes in
the ferris hops the cab
ferris slams the door
a mans hand reaches for the handle as the cab pulls away
tom and his guests watch in bewilderment at their cab takes off
music comes up
the grand old chicago museum
the main gallery is crowded with school kids
a class of kids walking along holding hands
among the second graders are ferris sloane and cameron holding hands looking like giant grade schoolers
baby chicks are hatching in a huge round incubator
sloane ferris and cameron are intently watching the process
sloane ferris and cameron ride in the coal train in the coal mine replica
ferris and sloane are making out
sloane operates a metal press to produce a tin ashtray
a giant walk thru replica of a human heart
ferris staggers out of it clutching his heart feigning a massive heart attack
ferris is examining the controls of the captured u boat
he checks to see if hes being watched then he presses a button and pulls a lever
for the first time in forty years the screw turns
the famous stages of life display which features bottled fetuses
the ninth month
a tiny human being in a jar
sloane wants to cry
camerons stomach is in his throat
ferris is lost in thought
the music ends
remorsefully i wonder if he has a name
blank ninth month
from the merchandise mart looking down the fetid green swath of water
a boat is rolling up the man made canyon
are you guys worried about nuclear war
cameron its a beautiful day weve won our freedom were traveling down one of americans most scenic polluted waterways and you have to bring up nuclear war
it is kind of raggy subject cam
its with us every day
the possiblity of global destruction
dont you think its an issue because people need something to worry about
they have to like have some major problem that puts all their little bullshit into some kind of persepective
they used to have viet nam
they used to have the oil crisis stuff and iran
thats over and people have to have their big issue
its not like somebody came up with the nuclear holocaust yesterday at noon you know
to answer your question
no im not worried about it at all
we dont know when the bombs going off
we do know however that college starts in the fall
dramatic deadly serious do you know what a nuclear winter is
everybodys dead its real cold and the skiings for shit
the boat makes the turn in the river and clears frame
the three are sitting on the aft deck of the tour boat
their feet are up on the railing
very casual very relaxed
discussing the end of the world
my step fathers always going off about how when he was young he was committed to all these causes
hes full of shit
all the old hippies are full of shit
he says i dont care about things like he did
whats he care about now
baldness fatty meats and money
i rest my case
whats spooky is they still control everything
they took over when they were young and they never gave it up
one of the most frightening experiences of my young life has been observing my parents and our neighbors playing the baby boom edition of trivial pursuits
its chilling to see people crazed with the minutia of their past
its human nature to like what you had better than what you have
a loud speaker on the boat identifies a point of interest
the three look to the left
the sears tower
you know this is all very interesting but im starving
an hour ago you wanted to yack
i feel better now
lean over and grab a fish
cameron looks over the side of the boat
an obtuse thought flashes through sloanes brain
what comes after a nuclear winter
jeanie is having a small moral debate with herself
its reprehensible to squeal on your own flesh and blood
but its for his own good
his cavalier attitude will get him into trouble later in life
and itll continue to piss me off and ill get so wadded up that itll cause cervex cancer and hell ruin my life
she slips into the deans outer office
rooneys secretary is behind her desk
jeanie walks in
the secretary looks up and greets her with a weary smile
whos bothering you now
jeanie scowls at her
is dean rooney in
im sorry hes out
can i help you
condescending i seriously doubt it
whens he back
i dont know
he left the grounds on personal business
a car tire rolls into frame and stops
slide across to the sidewalk
rooneys dress shoe steps out onto the pavement
move up to reveal rooney standing at the door of his bile green lebaron
rooney peels off his shades and looks around like hes dirty harry
in his mind he is dirty harry
rooneys dres shoe on the hydrant
he ties his lace and pulls up his sock
rooney straightens his tie and jacket and slips into a rowdy hot dog joint
its jammed with construction workers secretaries suburban businessmen
its loud and confusing
rooney pushes his way in and scopes the crowd
a young person is playing a video game in a far corner
he suspects its ferris
it look sort of like ferris
he smiles and cuts into the crowd
move in on the player
ive been waiting a long time for this
the player looks up
your ass is mine
the player turns around
its a girl
the blood evacuates his face
he stares at the girl
she stares at him
she picks up her coke
she puts the straw to her lips and sucks
hes still staring
he cant think of anything to say
holding the straw in the mouth she draws it out of the cup
she raises it pointing it directly in rooneys face
he squints she blows a strawful of coke in rooneys face
a hand yanks a napkin hold
rooney wipes his face
behind him is the kitchen and a grease covered tv set broadcasting a cubs baseball game
theres a long foul ball
the tv camera follows the ball into the stands
a kid makes a stab at the ball
rooney wipes his suit off
the tv camera zooms in on the boy triumphantly holding the foul ball aloft
he does a little celebration dance
rooney wads up the napkin and tosses it in a trashbin
the tv camera returns to the game
rooney glances at the screen
whats the score
zero to zero
rooney nods and exits
ferris sits down with the baseball
he shakes his stinging paw
on either side of him are cameron and sloane
camerons scarfing nachos
i think i broke my thumb
can we leave now
you want to leave
we just got here
you got a call you broke your thumb whats left to do
cameron offers his nachos to sloane
she looks at them with disgust
no wonder youre always sick
ferris leans back puts his hands behind his head and turns his face to the bright sun
do you realize that if i played by the rules right now id be in gym
a boys gym class is doing laps
a blue fiat pulls into the shot
jeanies at the wheel
she sneaks a glance at the school
i cant believe my brothers making me put myself in a position where i could get expelled
selfish little moron
youre overshadowed me long enough
im gonna get you buddy
she puts the car in gear and drives out of the shot
a parade is underway
floats and politicians
marching bands drum and bugle corps soldiers school kids
figure skating club in outfits and skates performing their routines on pavement
its german american appreciation day
riding atop on a float is ferris
hes waving to the crowd
he and half a dozen homely german american beauty queens
hes leading the girls in singing danke shoen
theyre watching ferris go by
they wave to him
i love him
its hard not to
cameron breaks a smile
as worried as he is about the day and getting caught he has to admire ferris for his lack of inhabitions
cameron mumbles a few words
do you believe in reincarnation
do you believe that you lived before
do you ever wonder what you were
i dont have to wonder
sloane looks at him with amazement
i was a tractor tire
ferris is on his knees reaching down from the float shaking hands with people in the crowd
guten tag dude
sloane and cameron continue their conversation
what were you in a previous life
im not sure but i think i know who ferris was
from the a team
the guy who rode the elephants into switzerland
sloane laughs at herself
they step out of the crowd and head down the street in the direction the parades heading
i think if he was anybody he was magellan
you know the guy who went around the world
i could see him ignoring popular belief and taking off on some impossible mission
as long as ive known him everything works for him
theres nothing he cant handle
i cant handle anything
school parents the future
ferris can do anything
ferris is playing twist and shout on the accordian
the girls on the float are singing
they continue their conversation
the futures worse for a boy isnt it
cameron doesnt understand what she means
a girl can always bail out and have a baby and get some guy to support her
thats a pretty grim thought
true but its an option
no options is worse
i dont know what im gonna do
yeah but to do what
what are you interested in
they walk on for a few beats
we hear twist and shout growing louder and louder
the sons is taking over all the other tunes in the band
its infecting the entire parade
what do you think ferris is gonna do
theyre playing twist and shout
a band of punks are dancing on the roof of a news kiosk
a woman and her two toddlers sing along
hes wearing a shower cap and a maroon overcoat
he singing along
theyre marching down the parade
theyre singing in their angleic voices
with their brooms ready
the entire parade is singing and playing twist and shout
the politicians and their wives stand up
the clergymen stand
marching in formation and in wwii uniforms
ferris leads the beauty queens in the rousing finale
the entire parade is at frenzy pitch
the sound of the voices blends with the sound of a red lined the port of chicago
grim gritty waterfront
suddenly camerons fathers car flies over camera
like the opening shot in star wars
the starship ferrari
it travels past to reveal a beautiful blue sky
his eyes are wide with exhilaration
mouth open tongue out
maniac at the wheel
his eyes are closed
slo mo theyre looking up in the air following the car as it flies over them
broad excited smiles
the cars shadow passes over them
it fills the frame and stops
we move up to reveal rooney behind the wheel of his car
rooney gets out of his car
he looks at the house looks up and down the street then crosses to ferris house
rooneys at the front door
we see him peek in a window at the top of the door
the doorbell rings
it acknowledges the doorbell
it clicks on
the house intercom activates
we hear ferris voice
who is it
rooney presses the intercom
this is ed rooney ferris
id like to have a word with you
im sorry i cant come to the door right now
im very ill and im afraid that in my weakened condition i could take a nasty spill down the stairs and subject myself to further school absenses
theres a pause
rooney presses the intercom again
come down here
you can reach my parents at their places of business
thank you for stopping by
i appreciate your concern for my well being
it will be remembered long after this illness has past
his voice clicks off
rooney presses the intercom again
im not leaving until you come down and talk to me
have a nice day
rooney presses the intercom
im not leaving ferris
theres no response
rooney rings the doorbell again
the pre recorded litany starts over
who is it
rooney doesnt realize that hes listening to a recording
dont get smart with me ferris
im sorry i cant come to the door right now
im very ill and im afraid that in my weakened condition
rooney leans back from the door
he cant quite figure out whats going on
buts its highly suspicious
rooney steps through the hedges and peeks in the windows
we hear ferris voice inside
you may reach my parents at their places of business
rooney tries to peak in the kitchen window
i appreciate your conern for my well being
it will be remembered long after
a black rubber doggie door
the type that allows a dog to come and go as it pleases
rooney is crouched down
he lifts the doggie door and peeks in the house
along the kitchen floor
through the kitchen into the dining room
we hear a large dog growl
hes peaking through the door
he hears the dog
his face freezes
have a nice day
a rottweiler bursts through the doggie door in a fury of gnashing teeth and foam
tassled pasties twirl like airplane propellers
theyre sitting in a booth in the garish nearly deserted strip joint
camerons mouth is open in amazement
sloane is embarrassed and revolted
how does she do that
one goes one way one goes the other
shes probably schizophrenic
ferris this is nauseating me
im losing respect for you by the bucket
you dont think its amazing that we got in
who wants to get in
cameron looks like a toddler for christs sake
im talking about a major achievement in false identification
im not interested in watching someone jiggle their mammary glands
point well taken
but consider why she does it
why she does it and you dont
im not a tramp
maybe her life fell apart
maybe she lost somebody
to camera this kind of thing makes me a little depressed
you may think because im the age i am that im a sex maniac
that sex is all i think about
but thats not true
im a romantic
i think alot of people my age are
we think about love and matters of the heart
and sat scores and acne aside we worry about lonliness
its a terrible thing
and we feel it
i feel it
he flips his collar up curls his lip and affects an elvis impression
a sappy do wop track fades up
the club lights go down
cameron and sloane disappear into darkness
ferris stands up from the booth
he strolls slowly through the empty club as the stripper bumps and grinds in a pool of blue light
you know someone said the worlds a stage and each must play a part
fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart
act one was when we met
i loved you at first glance
you read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue
then came act two
you seemed to change
you acted strange
and why ive never known
he climbs up on the little runway
the stripper disappears in darkness as ferris takes over the spotlight
honey you lies when you said you loved me and i had no cause to doubt you
but id rather go on hearing your lies than to go on living without you
now the stage is bare and im standing there with emptiness all around and if you wont come back to me then they can bring the curtain down
elvis fades up
the orignal recording
ferris lip synchs with the big dramatic florish that was the kings trademark ballad sign off
ferris drops his head
like the king would
camerons father is looking at the car
hes studying it
it looks terribly familiar
he leans into the open car and reaches for the glovebox to see if the contents will confirm if its his
he looks up slowly
the attendant and the rastaman are glowering at him
theyre holding bags of fried chicken
you looking for something in my car
he shakes his head no
jeanies standing at her car
shes staring incredulously into the distance
her mouths open
shes shaking her head slowly
spray painted on the town water tower in gigantic black letters save ferris bueller
im gonna microwave his nuts
ferris sloane and cameron in the backseat of a checker
ferris is on one window cameron on the other
sloanes in the middle
ferris is talking to the driver
he leans forward and reads the drivers name off the city license
so yuri how long have you been in america
whats your overall impression
its very good here
better than russia
much better here than in russia
clearly youve never been to an american high school
ferris sits back
he puts his arm around sloane
its getting late ferris
i have to get the car home
i know you dont care but it means my ass
you think i dont care
i know you dont care
that hurts cameron
jump back ferris camerons been a good sport
cameron whatd you see today
cameron looks at him
you saw four states a submarine a giant heart seventy five dollars worth of cooked pancreas two of the most incredible breasts ever to come out of modern plastics major
league baseball and
quizical look are you gonna chuck your nachos
camerons staring past ferris
ferris realizes hes looking at something out the window
in the gridlock traffic their cab is squeezed tight alongside another cab
in that cab is tom
hes about a foot from ferris
he turns and looks right into camera
ferris frozen face
tom glances back at his paper
turns back to camera
sloane is sitting where ferris was
shes wearing sunglasses looking bored
she turns and glances out the window
fakes a yawn
tom stares at her
he looks away
cameron and ferris are on the floor
on their asses with their backs to the back of the front seat feet up on the seat
to sloane whats he doing
revolted hes looking at me and hes licking the glass and making obscene gestures with his hands
sloane bursts out laughing
she licks her finger and touches ferris knee
she makes a sizzling sound
she collapes on the seat in hysterics
toms looking into ferris cab
sloanes bouncing up and down
he cant quite figure out whats going on
he turns and slowly raises his newspaper over his face
we see on the back of the paper a small story with the headline community the rottweilers chewing on a shoe
tearing it apart
hes standing outside the fence
hes missing a shoe
his suit pants are torn from the crotch to the knee
his suit coat pocket is torn off
his hairs messed and therere grass stains on his knees and elbows
hes looking in at the dog
dress shoe you worthless mutt
the rottweiler leaps at camera
ferris is leading the way down michigan avenue
hes hustling through the crowd
he has sloane by the hand
shes jogging to keep up
camerons a few steps behind
he keeps bumping into people
ferris and sloane make the turn at wacker driver and disappear into the stone container building
cameron follows mumbling again
a florist truck pulls up in front of the house
a delivery man gets out iwth a huge floral arrangement
he heads up to the house
rooneys sitting on the porch patting a bloody knee with his handkerchief
the delivery man hops up on the steps
rooney looks up at him
he greets rooney cheerily
he presses the doorbell
a beat and we hear ferris recording
who is it
the deliver man presses the intercom
focus on flowers
i have a delivery
im sorry but i cant come to the door right now
im very ill and im afraid
its a recording asshole
that in my weakened condition i could take a delivery man nasty spill and subject whats your problem
myself to further school absenses
rooney pause hes one of my students
you can reach my parents at their places of delivery man business
thank you for little buggers dying
i appreciate your concern for my well rooney being
it will be what
remembered long after this illness has passed
as i heard it from our mailman he was supposedly born with only half a kidney
have a nice day
to the intercom thank you
continues i dont know the details
but my boss had to send to milwaukee to get more orchids
hes very popular
rooney is flabbergasted
nobodys home here
you gonna be around for awhile
i imagine so
you wanna keep an eye on these
rooney looks at the flowers
then he looks at the delivery man
happy sigh it really touches me that so many people are rallying behind this guy
i guess theres hope for the human race afterall
he hands the arrangement to rooney
he bounds off the porch and trots to the truck
rooney looks incredulously at the arrangement
he opens the attached card
defeated oh christ
its signed the number one afternoon fm rockn roll d
is sitting behind his microphone
i dont know who that was or what they were playing but i apologize for it nonetheless
pause i have a guest with me today
he put his headphones on
jeanies car pull in the driveway
we hear her car radio
his name is ferris mueller
she goes into shock
her eyes blink her head cocks
sorry about that
jeanie draws back and punches out her radio
the impact of her blow to the radio shoots the antenna in the air
ferris leans forward and adjusts the microphone
he has an incredible story
ferris turns to camera
im going to tell a massive lie here
its going to by very thick and very steamy
i think radios a facinating medium it challenges the imagination
unlike television which provides the images radio
pause you know this
anyway its always been a dream of mine to be on the radio
i have what i consider to be an excellent broadcast voice
i practise it in the bathroom all the time
i used to play records and do introductions to them
but ive never had the chance to sit behind a microphone and try it out for real
this is a watt outlet
im going out to several million people so let me just say im in a very pleasant groove right now
clears his voice speaks into the mike affects a radio voice well steve you and your listeners are probably not going to believe this but
a group of kids are sitting around a blaster
im the first chicago area youth to be selected to participate in a space shuttle mission
ferris turns from the mike to camera
i was going to say i knew springsteens home phone number and i was going to give out the number of the new jersey state police but i thought i
might get busted
after i got flunked in drivers ed for sideswiping a mail box which was not in any way shape or from my fault
i was putting out a cigarette like i was told
it was weird
im so used to getting in a car and lighting up because im not allowed to smoke at home that i got in the drivers ed
car and spaced completely pulled out of the lot lit up a boro and mrs
heller looked at me like id just pulled a bunny out of my nose or something and i realized what the hell i was doing and i went to put
it out and hit the mail box
anyway i was so pissed off at her reaction to the whole thing that i considered running an ad in a sleaze magazine for a school teacher that does phone
sex and i was gonna use mrs
hellers home number but is cost too much
i took it again and passed
but i had to work at burger king to get the cash to pay for the drivers ed
the car got fixed in auto shop for nothing and i think rooney pocketed the cash
but i cant prove it
im in high school remember
he turns back to the dj
how did you get picked for this
its kind of a long story but ive been doing alot of programming for a even larger group of kids is listening to the blaster
theyre cheering him on
the rottweiler is laying unconscious on the lawn
the flower arrangement is scattered all over the yard and the ceramic vase the flowers were in has obviously struck the dog
the broken pieces are all around the dogs head
hes smiling with great satisfaction
sleep tight pooch
he hears something in the house
his head snaps around
he drops down and peek in the windows
a glimpse of a fleeting figure
his eyes dance in anticipation of revenge
jeanie kicks the door open
the yardstick flings the covers and the pillows beneath them in the air
she stomps in and turns off the snoring synthesizer
i knew it
she grabs the phone and sits down
she dials a number
rooney sneaks around the side of the house
he slinks up on the porch
the front doors open
he peeks in
jeanies on the phone
where is she
this is her daughter
do you know where she is
do you know when shell be back
do you know anything
she slams the phone down
the worm has luck like clams have body odor
shes startled by a noise downstairs
a smile spreads across her face
hes back and shes going to nail him
rooney sneaks into the house
he looks around the foyer and heads into the kitchen
jeanie tiptoes down the stairs
rooney sneaks through the kitchen into the den
jeanie comes down the stairs into the foyer
rooney comes out of the den back into the kitchen
he crosses back toward the foyer
jeanie sneaks into the kitchen
jeanie and rooney come face to face
jeanie squeals in horror
she doesnt recognize rooney as himself but as an intruder
she drops into a karate stance and kicks rooney in the face
he hits the deck
she flees back up the stairs
boyd is sitting in the backseat of joyces car listening to the radio
my input on the star wars defense plan was pretty substantial so i guess this is their way of rewarding me
im pretty flattered
joyce and her clients leave a show house and head toward the car
boyd looks out the window as his parents and joyce appear
can you stay around and take a few phone calls
id really like to but i have a kidney operation in about an hour
joyce and her clients take one last look at the house
if youre willing to commit a little time and a little money to this place you can really have something to be proud of
dont let the black living room throw you off
she opens the car door
the door opens
i wish you the best of luck
a very interesting guy ferris bueller
joyce gets in
the clients get in the other side
a song starts
to the kid well boyd how are you bearing up
the kid stares at her
did i tell you i have a son your age
his name is ferris
i think youd like him
boyd sits up in the seat at the mention of ferris name
is he going up in the space shuttle in september
joyce looks around at boyd
she gives him a curious look
not that i know of
i knew he was bullshitting
watch your mouth
how do you watch your mouth
do you know my son
dont pay any attention to him
he thinks its cute to bait adults
i dont think its cute
i think its fun
joyce give him a puzzled smile and starts the car
jeanies on the phone
shes in a panic
this is not a phoeny phone call
theres an intruder male caucasian possibly armed certainly weird in our kitchen
pause my name is bueller
theres another pause
jeanies face drops
its real nice that you hope my brothers feeling better but im in danger okay
im very cute im very alone and im very protective of my body
id rather not have it violated or killed
i need help
rooneys plugging his bloody nose with paper towel
the intercom goes on
if whoevers in the house is still in the house id like you to know that i have just called the police
if you have any brains whatsoever youll get your ass out of my house real quick
rooney stiffens with fear
id also like to add that i have my fathers gun
and a scorching case of herpes
rooneys car is hooked to a tow truck
its parked in front of a fire hydrant and the windshield is decorated with parking citations
in the distance sirens wail
the three are waiting for the ferrari
we hear tires squealing an engine reving out
then the ferrari pulls down the ramp and jams to a frightening stop
a black guy jumps out
ferris hands him the parking stub
just out of curiosity what was your top speed coming down the ramp
matter of fact about
he hands him a buck and opens the door and pulls the passenger seat forward for cameron
this is probably the last time youll have to ride back here
keep that in mind
cameron gives him a look and squeezes in
the ferrari cruises through traffic
sloanes in the passenger seat
ferris is driving and cameron is crammed in the back
we return the car
we could go to my house
my parents arent coming home until late
we have enough cash left for a quick flight to peoria and back
ferris looks in the mirror and changes lanes
he glances down at the speedometer then to the road
and back to the speedometer
how many miles did you say this thing had when we left
one hundred and twenty six and halfway between three and four tenths
how many miles are on it now
he glances down at the speedometer
the odometer reads
to camera heres where cameron goes berserk
the ferrari pulls up at a stop light
we hear a thundering the ferrari is buzzing through traffic
sloane turns in her seat and looks at cameron
her gesture is one of genuine support
his eyes are frozen in a mindless vacant stare
he looks at sloane
well fix it
hes still holding the stare
he starts to breathe heavily
she whips around in the seat and grabs his arms
cut it out
he shoots sloane a look
cameron are you okay
its no problem really
your old man wont know a thing
its completely fixable
sloane fires an angry look at ferris
it is a problem
for him its a problem
nothings a problem for you
but its a problem for him
so just shut up
she turns back to cameron
what can i do cameron
he knows what hes doing
the doorbell rings
the ferris tape is activated
who is it
we hear a male voice over the intercom
im sorry that i cant come to the door right now
the tape continues as jeanie hurtles down the stairs
thank you god
thank you thank you thank you
she jumps the last few stairs and slides to the front door
she whips it open
the door swings open
her jaw goes slack
she blinks her eyes
the delivery man and a young assistant are standing at the door with floral arrangements
spread all around them are more flowers
a sexy singing nurse and a balloon man steps up on the porch
sings the door slams shut
rooneys walking down the street
a school bus is crawling alongside him as kids hang out the windows
from inside we hear shouting and seventeen different songs playing on blasters
a top forty montage
whatre you doing
rooney doesnt respond
did you get in a fight
rooney keep walking
the bus doors open
the driver calls out to him
you want a lift
rooney takes a few more steps
the bus stops
rooney takes a deep breath
he climbs aboard the bus
the bus is jammed with wonks and weinerettes
the passengers are silent as they watch rooney shuffle down the aisle and take an empty seat next to a skinny myopic girl
she looks at rooney and smiles
she pushes her coke bottle glasses up on her nose
he looks vacantly at her
she holds her smile
ill bet you never smelled a real school bus before
he stares at her
she holds up a candy package
he stares at her
she puts one in her mouth
theyve been in pocket
theyre real soft and warm
a rotund freshman boy sitting across from rooney is staring at him
he looks across to the kid
he leans forward
its kind of like being in the belly of the beast isnt it
he turns him eyes to the front
the bus jerks forward and pulls away
it grinds through the gears as it heads down the quiet street
the blasters go back on the shouting resumes
camerons laying on a picnic table
sloanes sitting beside him on the table
shes stroking his hair
ferris walks into the foreground
he addresses camera
this may very well be for real
i think cameron might have blown a micro chip or two
hes always been a little keyed up
all i wanted to do was give him a good day
were gonna graduate in a couple of months
then we have the summer
hell work and ill work
and well see each other at night and on the weekends but then hell go to one school and ill go to another
and basically thatll be it
as much as we like each other the process of growing up will separate us
he begins to walk
we follow him
sloanes a bigger problem
she still has another year of high school
how do i deal with that
i was serious when i said id marry her
this isnt just teenage infatuation
thats what my parents call it
what do they call what they have
if thats love ill take infatuation
his eyes are closed
sloanes stroking his hair
camerons never been in love
at least no ones ever been in love with him
hes gonna marry the first girl he lays
and shes gonna treat him like shit because hes gonna kiss her ass for giving him what hes built up in his mind as the end all be all of
she wont respect him because you cant respect someone who kisses your ass
it just doesnt work
shes studying camerons face
she looks away
he looks to the picnic table
then back to camera
im being tested here
he starts back to the picnic table
my best friend has flipped out
conventional wisdom would suggest a visit to the nearest trauma center
i wouldnt fault anybody for doing that
my personally i think this calls for something new something bold something wet and wild
a hyrdojet spews a gush of air bubbles
a finger pushes the play button on the cassette
music comes the finger pops a beer
a painted fingernail pierces the cellophane wrapper
ferris and sloane are in sloanes parents jacuzzi
their clothes are tosssed around the deck
camerons been placed in a patio chair at the edge of the jacuzzi
hes still catatonic
hes mummbling softly
ferris is drinking a beer
sloanes eating oreos
you feeling any better cameron
the waters really nice
i wish youd come in
staring into space
they look at each other
she offers him a cookie
he offers her his beer
do you think this because of the car or is it a combination of everything shitty in your life
he doesnt respond
sloane sips the beer
you just cant deal with anymore shit
the car took you into the red zone
time for a reality check
i could flip real easy too
theres nothing wrong with it
at one time or another everybody goes to the zoo
maybe he was actually sick
maybe he wasnt bullshitting himself
ferris and sloane watch their catatonic friend
she leans forward and stares at cameron
he cocks his head wondering what camerons up to
he keels over forward
cameron falls out of the chair and splashes down face first into the water
ferris leaps for him
ferris struggles with camerons lifeless bulk
ferris thrashes around in the water
ferris grabs camerons collar and rips him out of the water
ferris sits cameron on the edge of the jacuzzi
his eyes are closed
his face is a mask of terror
he shakes cameron
a smile spreads across his face
he sees the smile
he stops shaking cameron
ferris and cameron are looking at each other
sloanes still screaming
she realizes that camerons okay
she stops screaming
cameron you asshole
ferris starts to laugh
cameron explodes with laughter
whats so funny
jeanies sitting on a wooden bench with a wasted teenage boy in a triumph t shirt long hair torn jeans creepers studs and chains
hes studying her
no thank you
i meant are you here for drugs
jeanie stares at him
why are you here
i dont know why im here
then why dont you go home
why dont you put your thumb up your butt
the boy stares at her
you want to talk about your problem
are you serious
yeah im serious
jeanie turns away
the boy crosses his legs
jeanie looks back at him
you really want to know whats wrong
the boy shrugs
if youve got the time ive got the troubles
in a nutshell i hate my brother
did you shoot him or something
no not yet
the boy nods
he understands the emotion
i went home to confirm that the shithead was ditching school and a guy broke into the house and i called the cops and they picked me up for making
a phoney phone call
what do you care if your brother ditches school
jeanie stares at the boy
why should he get to ditch school when everybody else has to go
you could ditch
id get caught
so youre pissed at him because he ditches and doesnt get caught
the boy nods knowingly
then your problem is you
you oughta spend a little more time dealing with yourself and a little less time worrying about what your brother does
its just an opinion
jeanie stares angrily at him
partly because hes so bold and partly because hes so right
theres somebody you should talk to
jeanie stares at him threateningly
if you say ferris bueller you lose a testicle
you know him
it curls into a fist
its spinning rapidly
a bricks resting on the accelerator holding it down
ferris cameron and sloane are sitting in the garage
the ferrari is jacked up
the wheels are turning
the engines racing
the whole time i was just thinking things over
i was like meditating
i was thinking about the future
and i realized it doesnt make and difference if the present goes to shit
i have a agree with you there
ive been thinking all day that if you could only have the use of one word what would it be
sloane is naked before your eyes and youre thinking about words
god bless you cameron
thank you sloane
if you guys only had one word what would it be
i cant believe youd think up something like with a naked girl in a jacuzzi right in front of you
come on ferris answer his question
its the only word you could ever use
and what is you loathe somebody
are you going to say love every time you see them
its better than hello
you wanna be generic
cameron smiles at his wisdom
ferris and sloane think about it
its a good choice
cameron gets up and walks to the ferrari
the word is help
cameron peeks in the window
cameron pulls his head out of the car
its not working
ferris looks up
the miles arent coming off running it in reverse
i thought that might be a problem
lets crack open the odometer and roll it back by hand
cameron shakes his head
i got a better idea
he walks back around behind the ferrari
seventeen years and ive never taken a stand
now im gonna do it
im taking a stand against my father against my family against myself against my past my present and my future
i will not sit idly by as events that affect me unfold to change the course of my life
i will take a stand and i will defend it
when my father comes home tonight hes finally going to have to deal with me
good or bad im taking a stand
he turns to camera
this is a big u fan
she smiles proudly at cameron
she applauds him
hes serious and determined
he has made up his mind and it appears that it wont be changed by anyone but himself
its spinning wildly
camerons foot rests on the bumper
a beat and it gives a mighty shove
the spinning tires slam down on the cement
cameron has kicked the ferrari off the jack
it squeals out of the garage in a cloud of blue tire smoke
a unmanned investment heading backwards down a driveway
theyre in shock
the ferrari shoots down the driveway
cameron watches the car go
hes strangely placcid about the impending disaster
ferris and sloane are bewildered
the ferrari travels down the driveway across the street over the curb into the wooded property opposite the house
the ferraris brief journey ends as it smacks a tree trunk
ferris and sloane exchange baffled looks
they look at cameron
hes proud and bold
what was that about
this has to be a dream
one quick question
whyd you do that
cameron holds his proud posture for a beat
then a look of bewilderment comes over his face
he shoots a look to ferris
a puzzled look
you trashed the car
cameron looks across the street
i took a stand
you wrecked a car
cameron thinks for a moment
then he regains his confidence
ferris looks across the street at the car
i have an idea
if youre interested
cameron looks at him
he shakes his head
im gonna handle it
i think this could work
i want to deal with it by myself
what about your one word
you already did it
if i need it again ill use it
he raises am impish eyebrow
joyce is talking with the juvenile officer
outside the office on the bench we see jeanie and the boy making out
shes never been in trouble before
this is a shock to me
first i dont know why she wasnt at school
second i dont know why shed call you with this story about a rapist
for whatever reasons she did it i think shed had a good scare
i hope so
i appreciate your calling me
i can assure you that her father and i will have a long talk with her
the gathers her purse and jacket and stands
oh by the way i hope you sons feeling better
joyce looks at the officer curiously
tell him all the guys at the station here are pulling for him
jeanie quickly breaks the embrace with the boy as joyce steps out of the juvenile officers room
shes still a little bewildered that everybody knows ferris was ill
jeanie wipes her lips and sits up straight
the boy adjusts his pants to better hide his passion
to the boy if you keep this to yourself i think we can probably get it on pretty good
jeanie stands up
dont hi me young lady
get your stuff
jeanie reaches down for her purse
whats your name
sloane and ferris are standing at the back fence
i had a great time today
it was pretty cool
you think camerons gonna be alright
he had to so it i guess
his old man had it coming
hell be okay
id be worried if hed taken my idea
sloane smiles knowingly
you didnt have an idea did you
not a glimmer
youre so smart
im just real loose
he kisses her
ill call you tonight
ferris jumps the fence and takes off across the backyards
sloane watches him go
a huge smile spreads across her face
she backs away from the fence
music fades up
hes gonna marry me
i know it
she turns and runs into the house
ferris sprints across a backyard
he jumps a plaster elf
ferris vaults a fence
he runs directly for a swimming pool
hes approaching it from the side
he leaps hits the diving board springs off does a flip and lands on the grass on the other side of the pool
neatly bundles stacks of bills and rolled coins
a significant amount of cash
we see a portion of the typewritten letter as she signs it
in the amount of
it gives us great pleasure to assist you in performance of your worthy and much needed survives to those so desperately in need
sincerely sloane peterson executive director the ferris bueller foundation hes running down the middle of the street
a car honks
ferris moves to the side
the car pulls around him
toms at the wheel
he glances in the mirror
he does a take
we see ferris cut across a front lawn and into a house
he realizes it couldnt be ferris
ferris runs through the kitchen past a woman fixing dinner and out her backdoor
the woman looks up curiously
tom pulls in the driveway
he parks and gets out
joyce pulls in from the other direction
ferris tries the door
he reaches down and lifts the doormat
the outline of a key in the dirt under the mat
the keys gone
the toe of a chewed up dress shoe steps into frame
an he stares up in horror
rooneys looking down at him
hes holding the house key
ferris stands up
looking for this
i got you ferris
this time i finally got you
ferris is caught
theres no way out
rooney gloats severely
how does another year of high school sit with you
suddenly the backdoor opens
jeanie looks out
she feigns joy and relief
she rushes ferris and hugs him
thank god youre alright
weve been worried sick
a moment of curiosity
then it dawns on him whats happening
his eyes dart from ferris to jeanie to ferris
his victory is evaporating
jeanie breaks the embrace
to rooney thank you for bringing him home mr
to ferris you better get up in bed tight now
ferris limps into the house
can you imagine someone as sick as ferris trying to walk home from the hospital
shakes her head kids
she raises her hands and strikes a karate pose
a huge smile passes over her face
a look of terror as he realizes that is was jeanie who kicked him and that jeanie knows it was he who she kicked
jeanie steps into the house
the door closes on rooneys defeated lost dejected bewildered face
not only has he lost ferris again he has jeanie to deal with next year
the click of the door wakes him up
his head pops up off the grass
he senses new danger
we hear an o
rooney squeezes his eyes shut
kimberly and todd are sitting at the kitchen table watching tv and eating cereal
they look up at ferris as he comes in from outside
does my head look like its getting bigger
ferris leans against the counter as he tries to catch his breath
he looks at his little brother
no but kimberlys is
he crosses to the refrigerator and opens it
kimberly feels her head
to todd is he serious
i think so
ferris takes out a bottle of orange juice out of the refrigerator and drinks straight from the bottle
jeanie comes in
by the way i borrowed some cash from you
ill pay you back
you dont have to
i want to
you dont have to
ive been ripping off your wallet for years
ferris gives her a proud smile
joyce and tom head up to the kitchen
ferris and jeanie exit the kitchen as joyce and tom enter
to todd and kimberly hi guys
is my head swelling up
the foyer is jammed with floral arrangements plants and gifts
ferris and jeanie step gingerly through the flowers and head upstairs
im sorry ive been riding your buns for so long
its completely cool
ferris continues up the stairs
he affects a sickly voice
ferris and jeanie stop
do you know a guy named garth volbeck
is he cool
but stay away from his brother
ferris walks into the room brushes the crumbs off his hands and peels off his shirt
he climbs into bed
no sooner are the covers over him than the bedroom door opens and joyce and tom walk in
they walk over to the bed
joyce sits down
the same deathly face he had in the morning
tongue out eyes bulging
how do you feel
he pulls in his tongue to speak
deathly gasp better thank you
tom and joyce hover over him with deep concern
im much better really
please dont make me stay home again
i want to go to school
im graduating in june and i
theres no point pushing yourself and making it worse
maybe youre right dad
i know im right
joyce leans over and kisses him forehead
how did you get so sweet
years of practice
tom pats ferris on the rump
he and joyce exit
the hideous face
a beat and we hear the bedroom door close
ferris looks at camera
happy sigh yeah life is a carousel
a great big crazy ball of pure living breathing joy and delight
he rolls over on his back and puts his hands behind his head
you gotta get one
