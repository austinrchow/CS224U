sally gathers herbs back at dr

theres something very wrong whats this
theres people singing songs whats this
the streets are lined with little creatures laughing everybody seems so happy have i possibly gone daffy
what is this
theres children throwing snowballs instead of throwing heads theyre busy building toys and absolutely no ones dead theres frost on every window oh i cant believe my eyes and in
my bones i feel the warmth thats coming from inside oh look whats this
theyre hanging mistletoe they kiss why that looks so unique inspired theyre gathering around to hear a story roasting chestnuts on a fire whats this
in here theyve got a little tree how queer and who would ever think and why
theyre covering it with tiny little things theyve got electric lights on strings and theres a smile on everyone so now correct me if im wrong this looks like fun
this looks like fun oh could it be i got my wish
oh my what now
the children are asleep but look theres nothing underneath no ghouls no witches here to scream and scare them or ensnare them only little cozy things secure inside their dreamland
the monsters are all missing and the nightmares cant be found and in their place there seems to be good feeling all around instead of screams i swear i can
hear music in the air the smell of cakes and pies are absolutely everywhere the sights the sounds theyre everywhere and all around ive never felt so good before this empty place inside of me is filling up i simply cannot get enough i want it oh i want it oh i want it for my own ive got to know ive got to know what is this place that i have found
what is this
christmas town hmm
ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho hmm
halloweentown this has never happened before

finkelsteins castle frogs breath will overpower any odor
coughing worms wart
wheres that worms wart
sally that soup ready yet

worms wart mmm and
i i thought you liked frogs breath
nothings more suspicious than frogs breath
until you taste it i wont swallow a spoonful
im not hungry
knocking spoon oops
you want me to starve
an old man like me who hardly has strength as it is
me to whom you owe your very life
oh dont be silly
eats soup with trick spoon mmmm see
finkelstein eats soup halloween did anyone think to dredge the lake
ah this morning
barks witch hear that
witch little what
fanfare as jack and zero arrive kid jacks back
where have you been
call a town meeting and ill tell everyone all about it
in his mayor truck town meeting town meeting town meeting tonight town meeting tonight at meeting clown giggles as he hits sally listen everyone
i want to tell you about christmastown
town meeting song performed by danny elfman and cast there are objects so peculiar they were not to be believed all around things to tantalize my brain its a world
unlike anything ive ever seen and as hard as i try i cant seem to describe like a most improbable dream but you must believe when i tell you this its as real as my skull and it does exist here let me show you this is a thing called a present the whole thing starts with a box a box
is it steel
are there locks
is it filled with a pox
a pox how delightful a pox if you please just a box with bright colored paper and the whole things topped with a bow a bow
how ugly whats in it
whats in it
thats the point of the thing not to know its a bat will it bend
its a rat will it break
perhaps it s the head that i found in the lake listen now you dont understand thats not the point of christmas land now pay attention we pick up an
oversized sock and hang it like this on the wall oh yes
does it still have a foot
let me see let me look is it rotted and covered with gook
um let me explain theres no foot inside but theres candy or sometimes its filled with small toys small toys do they bite
do they snap
or explode in a sack
or perhaps they just spring out and scare girls and boys what a splendid idea this christmas sounds fun i fully endorse it lets try it at once everyone please
now not so fast theres something here that you dont quite grasp well i may as well give them what they want and the best i must confess i have saved for the last for the ruler of this christmas land is a fearsome king with a deep mighty voice least thats what ive come to understand and ive also heard it told that hes something to behold like a lobster huge and red when he sets out to slay with his rain gear on carting bulging sacks with his big great arms that is so ive heard it said and on a dark cold night under full moonlight he flies into a fog like a vulture in the sky and they call him sandy claws well at least theyre excited but they dont understand that special kind of feeling in christmas land oh well
jacks house theres got to be a logical way to explain this xmas thing
finkelsteins castle youve poisoned me for the last time you wretched girl
locks sally away dingdong oh my head
the door is open
hel lo jack skellington up here my boy
i need to borrow some equipment
is that so whatever for
im conducting a series of experiments
how perfectly marvelous
curiosity killed the cat you know
come on into the lab and well get you all fixed up
jacks house zero im home
jack examines experiments with xmas stuff interesting reaction
but what does it mean
sallys room after sally jumps to give jack his basket
you can come out now if you promise to behave
jacks house sally gives jack his basket and sneaks off and picks a flower which catches on fire jacks obsession performed by danny elfman and cast somethings up with jack
somethings up with jack dont know if were ever going to get him back hes all alone up there locked away inside never says a word hope he hasnt died somethings up with jack somethings up with jack christmas time is buzzing in my skull will it let me be
i cannot tell theres so many things i cannot grasp when i think ive got it and then at last through my bony fingers it does slip like a snowflake
in a fiery grip something here im not quite getting though i try i keep forgetting like a memory long since past here in an instant gone in a flash what does it mean
what does it mean
in these little bric a brac a secrets waiting to be cracked these dolls and toys confuse me so confound it all i love it though simple objects nothing more
but somethings hidden through a door though i do not have the key somethings there i cannot see what does it mean
what does it mean
what does it mean
ive read these christmas books so many times i know the stories and i know the rhymes i know the christmas carols all by heart my skulls so full its
tearing me apart as often as ive read them somethings wrong so hard to put my bony finger on or perhaps its really not as deep as ive been led to think am i trying much too hard
ive been too close to see the answers right in front of me right in front of me its simple really very clear like music drifting in the air invisible
but everywhere just because i cannot see it doesnt mean i cant believe it you know i think this christmas thing its not as tricky as it seems and why should they have all the fun
it should belong to anyone not anyone in fact but me why i could make a christmas tree and theres no reason i can find i couldnt handle christmas time
i bet i could improve it too and thats exactly what ill do hee hee hee eureka
this year christmas will be ours
jack has a special job for each of us
finkelstein your xmas assignment is ready
finkelstein to the front of the line
what kind of a noise is that for a baby to make
perhaps it can be improved
i knew it

showing picture of santa and sleigh hmm
their construction should be exceedingly simple
how horrible our xmas will be

claws throw him in a box bury him for ninety years then see if he talks then mr
oogie boogie man can take the whole thing over then hell be so pleased i do declare that he will cook him rare wheeee i say that we take a
cannon aim it at his door and then knock three times and when he answers sandy claws will be no more youre so stupid think now lf we blow him up to smithereens we may lose some pieces and then jack will beat us black and green kidnap the sandy claws tie him in a bag throw him in the ocean then see if he is sad because mr
oogie boogie is the meanest guy around if i were on his boogie list id get out of town hell be so pleased by our success that hell reward us
