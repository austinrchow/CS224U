written by nicholas stoller based on the book the yes man by danny wallace first draft february its new years eve at rudys a hole in the wall dive
people stream into the bar to celebrate
outside carl kendall s and his soon to be ex girlfriend kath are having a quiet intense discussion
you dont do anything more
you used to be fun
now you hardly ever even leave your apartment
im here arent i
thats because its new years eve
you have to be here
besides its not only social stuff
you used to have dreams
you wanted to go to business school you wanted to work for the world bank
so i discovered b schools not for me
growing is x is not for me so ill do y
you went x is not for me and so i guess ill sit on the couch for the rest of my life
well look this sucks but i understand where youre coming from
this is the problem
you dont even care that im breaking up with you
of course i care
but i also understand
you shouldnt just understand
you should be mad

i get it
your girlfriend of two years breaks up with you right before new years eve and all you can say is i get it
it is completely within your right to call me a bitch
that would be inappropriate
tearing up i cant believe ive been dating someone so emotionless
itll be ok
carl hugs her
rudys is a dive bar
dartboard pool table scuffed wooden floors miller lite sign etc
the patrons are all facing the giant television
the new years ball is dropping
among the patrons is our hero carl his best friend peter peters girlfriend lucy their party friend rooney and his ex girlfriend kath whos still a little red eyed
three two one
happy new year
everyone blows noisemakers and pops champagne
patrons contd should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind
should auld acquaintance be forgot and days of auld lang syne
well that was fantastic
good night guys
youre going already
we havent even finished the song yet
i saw the ball drop and hugged all of you
aliens didnt invade
our computers are still working
what else could possibly happen
rooney might throw up
im very close
i see that happen like every night
good night and happy new year
his friends look concerned
how did he take the break up
like a robot
two years and nothing
im so sorry
carl goes into his apartment
he lies down in his bed and closes his eyes
close on the alarm
his alarm goes off
carl hits it off
its now daytime
carl gets dressed
he puts on a nametag for southwest bank
carl walks down the street fast
he passes a cute girl whos name well learn is renee passing out flyers for a band called the flying buttresses
wanna rock out tonight
i dont rock out
he walks into dunkin donuts
the dunkin donuts cashier hands carl his coffee
would you like an italian inspired coffee flavoring
how about the double doughnut special
carl sits at his cubicle flips on his email
reading the email dear trusted foreigner allow me to introduce myself
i am the deposed king of nigeria and i wish to propose a confidential transaction
to the computer allow me to delete you my liege
norman his needy boss comes up to him
my teller reporting for duty
im not a soldier
youre a soldier on the front line of finance
norman contd so carl im having a party this friday
its a funny hat party
may i entreat you to come
carl looks at his calendar
its totally empty
clearly lying im out of town
carl stands in the middle of the floor staring into the middle distance
a customer approaches him
hey i need to speak to a loan specialist and theres no one on the floor
today im officially a greeter
but theres no one around
someone might come
and if im not here they wont be greeted
youre really not going to help me
until im relieved as a greeter my hands are tied
the bank customer sits down in the sectioned off waiting area as carl stands in the middle of the floor
it is very awkward
no one comes in
carl slowly moves so a column blocks the customers view of him
now that carls behind the column he has a clear view of the entrance of the bank
through the floor to ceiling windows he sees the handsome new president of southwest bank chris parker tear up in a mercedes
he steps out of the mercedes with a hot girl on his arm
he and the girl walk into the bank
carl stares at them jealously
im chris parker
the new president of southwest bank
just wanted to come by and personally introduce myself to every branch manager
that would be me
chris turns to carl
im carl kendall
just a teller
i was just a teller
and now im just president of the largest bank in the southwest
to norman you need anything you let corporate know
chris parker and his hot secretary leaves
carl watches them clearly jealous
norman contd nice work if you can get it
am i right
clearly jealous yeah if youre into fake breasts and german engineering
check and check
the bank customer comes around
can you help me now
no but this gentleman can
carl indicates norman
norman goes to help the customer
carl stares up at the clock
the clock finally clicks to think about my party carl
carl microwaves a lean cuisine
carl watches survivor while eating lean cuisine
carl lays down and closes his eyes
the alarm goes off again
pull back to reveal its morning
carl walks into dunkin donuts
would you like an italian no thanks
how about no
carl ignores the girl handing out fliers
just wear something red
carl stares as the clock clicks to
hes out the door
carl warms up a frozen pizza
carl eats the frozen pizza and watches big brother
carl lies down
the alarm flips on
on the street
carl refuses the pamphlet
dress as your favorite animal sorry
carl eats frozen lasagna while watching the amazing race
historical figure no can do
carl at home eating frozen meatloaf and watching project runway
its now just a blur of images of carl at southwest bank shaking his head no eating lean cuisine and watching reality television
carls lying on his bed
the phone is ringing
he gets up and answers
on the phone carl
where are you
im in bed
did someone die
on the phone no
its just were at rudys
celebrating new years
carl looks at the alarm
i dont think i can make it
oh cmon carl
no ones seen you for like forever
please swing by
carl contd tell everyone happy new year
carl lies down and hangs up the phone
carl watches his alarm clock flip to am
he closes his eyes and goes to sleep
carls eating lunch at a picnic table outside
several bank employees smoke cigarettes near him
an oddly hyper guy named alex approaches carl
whats up buddy
alex hugs carl
howve you been
i cant believe youre still working here
whereve you been
normans been heartbroken since you quit
whereve i been
you mean where havent i been
i have lived
i climbed mt
i ate bat in laos
i shot a cow with a bazooka
im not proud of that last one but i did it
hows the bank
same old same old
thats the problem
thats everyones problem
youve got one life
why waste it on the same old same old
alex hands carl a pamphlet for a just say yes seminar
alex contd i know this will sound queer but you have to hit this seminar
it changed my life
it will change yours
unless you like the bank
every day its impossible not to throw rocks at the place
since you dont work here anymore you want to throw a couple
alex starts whipping rocks at the bank
whatre you doing
i was kidding
norman comes out
what do you think youre doing
recognizing alex alex eberts
is this an alumnae prank
i love pranks
alex continues throwing rocks at the bank
into a walkie talkie we have a situation
a couple portly security guards come out and wrestle alex to the ground
he manages to escape and run from the bank
go to the seminar carl
you wont be sorry
carl walks into his apartment
he hits play on his answering machine
over the answering carl its peter
i know you dont do things anymore but itd mean a lot if youd come by rudys tonight
lucy and i are celebrating our engagement
carls watching hells kitchen and eating a frozen pizza
theres a knock on the door
the just say yes pamphlet balled up on his desk
hes using it as a napkin
carl pauses the television show
he stands up and opens the door
peter stumbles in
what are you doing here
this is an intervention
youve missed your last event
whatre you talking about
our engagement party
im just really busy
youre watching hells kitchen
thats not even b list reality tv
so i dont want to go out tonight
maybe i have to wake up early tomorrow
you dont know
its bigger than that
you and kath broke up over a year ago and you still arent dating anyone
im like a sexual camel
i only need it once every couple years
i dont mean to be harsh but everyones moving forward
its like youre still wearing a timex while the rest of us each have entry level rolexes
you wear a rolex
thanks for noticing
its an oyster perpetual yachtmaster
sapphire crystal self winding
but thats not the point im trying to make
so i dont have an oyster watch
all you and lucy and kath do is sit around and talk about real estate and crate and barrel
whats wrong with crate and barrel
they have adorable stuff at reasonable prices
forget crate and barrel
maybe im just getting more mature
i dont need the lifestyle ever night
you have to have a life to have a style of life
you never leave your apartment
you never meet anyone new
i hate meeting people
youve become a complete cave dweller
i am not a cave dweller
just the other day we all went to summerfest and snuck backstage and you bet me i wouldnt steal something and so i stole a drumstick from that horrible swedish
thats not very cave dweller of me
just the other day
that was seven years ago
but thats not possible i was already working at the bank by then
you had started there three years earlier
why youve worked at that place for so long is beyond me
you had so much potential
you shouldnt be a teller
you should be the guy who tells the guy who tells the teller what to do
ive been a teller at southwest bank for ten years
how the hell did that happen
doing the math ten years
if i had had a child hed be toilet trained by now
actually hed be in fourth grade
starting to panic i was making out with chicks by fourth grade
i was a little man by fourth grade
i dont need this shit right now
im an adult man
i can live my life as i see fit
can you please leave
carl pushes peter out the door
carl sits down on the couch
he then unballs the just say yes pamphlet
it features an indian man smiling beatifically
a banner across a stage that has a photo of the same indian man smiling beatifically
we pan down to find carl among the crowd
carl sits down next to a wiry crunchy woman
is this your first time at one of sanjis lectures
have you been to this before
only like fifty eight times
sanjis a genius
he will blow your mind all over the goddamn room
hes like a mind grenade
i dont know if i want that
oh you do not
but you need it
and thats why you are here
do you want anything from the refreshment area
that processed shit will kill you faster than a pleasure cruise to chernobyl
carl heads over to the refreshment table
once hes out of her sight he sits down alone in a corner of the conference room
ethereal music begins to play over the loudspeakers
people begin to sit
carl sits down in the back
we are all living it
no one else does
the lights get rosier
contd or are we
change doesnt start on the surface
its generated from consciousness
but where is consciousness generated from
carl looks around
everyone is nodding along with it
sanji contd from the external
and the external is manipulated through our choices
and our choices start with one word
the music abruptly switches to the opening beats of jump by the pointer sisters
the rosy colored lights flip to bright white and sweep across the convention center room
it is suddenly like a rock concert
sanji s busts through the giant banner
the whole crowd starts cheering
sanji contd yes
instead of jump sanjis yelling yes
sanji contd say yes
for your life
change starts now
say it with me
sanji pumps his fist in the air as lame indoor fireworks go off
the crowd jumps on their feet
sanji contd are you ready to open the door to yes
i am sorry my friends
but i cannot hear you
the crowd quiets
sanji contd now is the time when we must greet our new members
who here is new
please do not be shy
the woman points at carl
the spotlight swings over to carl
he is annoyed
come on up future yes man
im just auditing
you cant audit life
now get on up here
im cool right here
then i will come to you
sanji runs off the stage and joins carl in the back of the conference hall
the spotlights follow him
sanji contd what is your name
let me guess carl
this was not your idea to come here carl
i wouldnt say that
you can tell me carl
we are all alone carl
the crowd laughs
it wasnt exactly my idea
thats what i thought carl
and you think this is all bullshit carl isnt that right carl
is there any other way
this whole thing seems retarded
but you are stuck in your life carl
am i right
i wouldnt necessarily you once had a dream
you wanted to own a boat
a fancy car
you wanted to a doctor a lawyer
a business man
carl nods surprised at sanjis incisiveness
sanji contd you wanted to be more than you are
and yet you have suddenly woken up to find life is passing you by
am i right carl
sanjis suddenly getting to carl
as sanji talks to him the moment between them becomes more and more intimate
it should feel like the rest of the crowd has disappeared
its odd that ten years can pass just like that
sanji contd isnt it carl
i want you to do something for me carl
tomorrow i want you only to say yes
can you do that for me
for one day carl
im not sure please carl
do it for me and you will be doing it for yourself
if you dont have the best day in ten years then i am the uncle of a monkey
will you do it for me carl
just for a day
sanji grabs carl hand and pulls him to his feet
we pull back and the crowd cheers
welcome to the world of yes
fireworks and confetti go off
the wiry anxious woman gives carl a creepy thumbs up
the phone starts ringing
carl sleepily grabs the phone
on the phone carl its peter
i just wanted to apologize about barging in yesterday
you were right
its your life to live
dont worry about it
on the phone me lucy and kath are all going out for brunch
you have any interest in joining
oh thanks for the invite but
will you do it for me carl
just for a day
back to carl and peter
we close in on carls mouth
in slo mo yes
clearly not wanting to yes
i will come to brunch
stackers is a cutesie brunch place
carl walks up to peter lucy and kath
this is a surprise
because ive never seen you at brunch
i love brunch
carl peter lucy and kath are still waiting with a big crowd of people to sit down for brunch
why do people wait an hour for breakfast
its so hot and bright and we havent even had coffee yet
if you dont want to be here you dont have to be
of course i want to be here
i love waiting an hour for eggs
although i will point out that you have sunglasses which is probably making this wait a lot easier
oakleys polarized lenses indestructible
two fifty but worth every penny
the waitress comes up
lowell party of five
a group of four people get up to be seated
we were definitely before those lowell people
i hate when people jump ahead
why does no one ever say anything
if you want to be sitting so bad why dont you say something
carl walks up to the waitress
carl contd excuse me but we were here before those people
no you werent
yes we were
i have the list dude
the list doesnt lie
meanwhile the customers the waitress was going to seat are looking away trying not to get involved
well this time the list lied
its ok carl
its just brunch
to the people who are being seated you all know that we were up before you
and you have to live with that knowledge through your delightful brunch
peter pulls carl away from the waitress
whats going on with you
i just want transparency in terms of the brunch seating order
one of the customers who was being seated heads over
now were going to get into a fight
we talked about what you said
you guys were here before us
sorry we didnt pipe up sooner
we cool brother
carl and the brunch dude punch fists and hug
carl and his friends are sitting at a table
carls slightly bored as his friends discuss real estate
its a two bedroom duplex with harbor views
itd be perfect for you kath
washer dryer in the building
i didnt realize you were looking to buy a place
i thought you and i would be renters to the end
shes a fancy lawyer making bank
its about time she was buying
the brunch dude is seated near carl
he gives him a thumbs up
carl gives a thumbs up right back
re the menus whatre you looking at
bacon and eggs
i dont want an adventure first thing in the morning
the waitress comes over
i just want to tell you about my specials
we have a double fruit burnt sugar waffle
any of you interested in that
then on the savory side we have a smoked whitefish omelet with hash browns on the side
you want both
the waitress writes that down
would you like toast with that
a side of our famous maple pancakes yes
someones really hungry
coffee or juice
we also have smoothies
carls friends look at him like a freak
is that all
turning towards his what would you all like to order
his friends are all looking at carl
carl has six dishes in front of him
the waitress comes over with a pepper mill
would you like some pepper
the waitress starts grinding pepper onto carls meal
its starting to take a long time
shes grinding and grinding and grinding
would you like more
she keeps grinding
a pile of peppers growing on his food
all of carls food is covered piles of pepper
i dont think ive ever seen a waiter tap one of those pepper mills
im just addicted to the stuff
chinese cultures say its good for digestion
youre all welcome to have some
do you want a bite of mine
carl takes a bite of lucys
he then sips his coffee
carl contd uch
why cant they make it black without all this frothy shit
because you ordered a latte
carls phone rings
he answers it
were a little short on our saturday staff
i know this is going against ten years of precedent but you have any interest in coming in today
i dont think
theres any reason why i shouldnt
on a saturday theres nothing i like more than the inside of a bank
there really is something magical about this place
carl walks into dunkin donuts
would you like an italian inspired coffee flavoring
sugar splenda or nutrasweet
all of them please
the confused dunkin donuts cashier loads up carls coffee
were having a special on munchkins
carl walks out of dunkin donuts carrying a giant coffee and several boxes of munchkins
he walks by renee the cute girl who hands out band fliers
want a flier
oh its you
of course ill take a flier
carl takes a flier
renees surprised carls taking a flier
carl contd the flying buttresses
i knew after a year and a half of wearing you down youd give in
im renee by the way
renee holds out her hand
i like to thank everyone personally who comes to our performances
it gives it a nice intimate touch
see you soon carl
carl turns away nervous that hes accepted her invitation
he takes a sip of his giant coffee and grimaces
carl stumbles into work hyper from the giant coffee
thanks for coming in and being part of the saturday banking experience
are those for the office you dirty devil
i just though it would be a fun way to lighten things up
deadly serious you didnt approve this with petty cash
i spent my own money on them
munchkins are always approved
although i cant reimburse you
over the intercom today is free munchkin day
free munchkin day
instantly carls cubicle is surrounded by fellow workers
youre the best
finally i have a reason to live today
a middle aged motherly customer comes in
how may i help you
i need to speak to a loan specialist
while loans arent normally in my jurisdiction id be happy to help you
carls trying to keep up as the customer launches into intense finance speak
i want to refi my house and spend the capital on my personal business
i see youve got a
year arm but over at chase theyre offering
can you refi lower like at
par example or am i going to have to bring my beeswax elsewhere
whats your business
selling beanie babies online
more like highly profitable
ive crunched the numbers
the woman hands over a scrapbook thats been decorated with construction paper and pictures of beanie babies
carl opens the scrapbook
its filled with numbers
let me just get final approval on this
carl gets up and walks over to norman
carl stands before norman
youre a teller not a loan specialist
no i know so if you think this is a bad idea for a loan thats fine but can you please tell her yourself
her business plan
norman grabs the business plan and starts reading it
my grandma loves beanie babies
although unfortunately we have a minimum loan floor of ten thousand dollars
she only wants five
howre you supposed to start a tiny business if you cant get a tiny business loan
i dont make the rules i just break em
i dont break them
i just wanted to rhyme
if she wants us to loan her ten thousand or more great
otherwise i think her only option is a loan shark
carl sits back down
so whatd he say
do you maybe have any interest in borrowing ten thousand
i cant afford the payments on ten
you cant do five thousand
this is the fifth bank ive been to
of course we can
one moment please
carl gets up
he heads over to the soda machine and buys a diet coke
he then heads over to normans desk
carl contd diet coke
oooh thank you
feed the addiction am i right
they clink diet cokes
norman downs his entire diet coke in one swallow
carl then heads over to the photocopier
he watches norman out of the corner of his eye
after a couple minutes norman gets up and heads into the bathroom
carl heads back over to normans desk and swipes the loan approval carl returns to the loan desk and stamps her form
the bank customer hugs carl
thank you so much
i promise i wont let you down mr
the bank customer hands carl a panda beanie baby
we dont like to make other customers jealous so can we keep this between you and i
arent you just a dear
the bank customer leaves
carl cant help but be touched
carls at the loan desk
norman comes over looking grave
carl could i see you for a moment
carl nervously walks into his office
carl nervously sits before norman
earlier today you showed some initiative
and i loved it
what do you say to a permanent spot at the loan desk
that seems like a lot of responsibility
we need a loan specialist a lot more than we need a teller and greeter
besides youd have a starting salary of
what is this darfur
waving to an african american employee sorry patricia that was inappropriate
then back to carl of course grand
to celebrate next saturday im throwing a party
dress up as your favorite character from heroes
save the cheerleader save the world
dont dress as hiro
i got dibs
wouldnt think of it
carl heads back to the loan desk happy about his promotion
carl walks in the door
peter lucy and rooney whos clearly been there for a little while comes up to him
out in the world
are you some kind of ghost
am i having a religious vision
because this guy just got a promotion
well lets get you a beer
you want a ouncer
im just joking yes
rooney looks at peter and lucy
a normal sized beer is fine with me
i think im done actually
two twenty ouncers and one tiny little beer barkeep
please dont call me that
were not in the middle ages
to carl i cant believe youre out here
i feel like a child whose best friend has strict chinese parents who never let him come out and play but now his chinese parents are away for the chinese
you have any interest in pounding this shit
rooney picks up his beer and begins pounding the twenty ouncer
carl reluctantly pounds it as well
rooney slams his on the table
carl puts it on the table
what do you say we have another
you are a beast
well its been fun watching you guys recreate freshman year but peter and i have some furniture errands to run
carls a little drunk now
have a good day yuppifying your lives
we need a sofa carl
were not buying a second home
whatever yuppy sellouts
it was good seeing you
you should come out more often
kind of pleading please dont leave me here with him
peter and lucy laugh not realizing that carl is serious
carl and rooney are really drunk
i have not been this drunk in years
the room is spinning in a bad way
two more double pints sil vous plait
that was the last barkeep
i am cutting you off
well fortunately youre not the only game in town
lets go to some place with class
rooney and carl are in a senor frogs
wheres the class
they wear uniforms here
a senor frogs waitress comes over
carl and rooney do jello shots
carl and rooney downing more jello shots
carl and rooney drinking beers
carl and rooney are drunkenly staring at a nearby group of girls
carl contd that girl is hot
or at least she seems hot
im kind of too drunk to tell
right now honestly you seem hot
i am hot
another jello shot
i think im done
carl downs the jello shot
he stumbles a little
senor frogs famous karoake contest is starting now
sign up and sweep us off our feet
you gotta do karoake
carl stumbles over to the senor frogs dj
hes losing control and he likes it
sign me up bitch
weve got our first victim
i mean singer
music cue the opening notes of white towns your woman carl grabs the microphone and heads out into the crowd
note to reader as you read this part i recommend listening to white towns your woman
it will bring it to life in a way that words on a page cannot do it justice
singing talking with an odd english accent just tell me what youve got to say to me ive been waiting for so long to hear the truth it comes as
no surprise at all you see so cut the crap and tell me that were through
now i know your heart i know your mind you dont even know youre being unkind so much for all your highbrow marxist ways just use me up and then
you walk away boy you cant play me that way
carl heads over to the hot girl and begins serenading her
she thinks its kind of funny
carl contd well i guess what you say is true i could never be the right kind of girl for you i could never be your woman
carl gets really close to the hot girls face and then coyly pulls away for the bridge of the song
during the awesome bridge carl does some fantastic dance moves
or rather moves that you think are fantastic when youre drunk out of your mind
the hot girl laughs at his antics
carl contd well i guess what they say is true i could never spend my life with a man like you i could never be your woman
i could never be your woman
i could never be your woman
carl lands on one knee in front of the hot girl
the crowd cheers for him
the hot girls large boyfriend gets up close to carl
everyone is very very drunk
were you just flirting with my girlfriend
re the hot girl it depends is that your girlfriend
he was just screwing around
let me handle this crystal
to carl so you want to have sex with my girlfriend
yes i do
are you starting a fight
cmon carl lets go yes i am
then bring it
carl doesnt really know what to do so he slaps him across the face the way a woman would slap a man
what was that
me bringing it
the brutish boyfriend punches carl in the head
carl contd im too drunk to feel
im like darkman
carl headbutts the guy
they get into a dirty drunken tussle
both of them are trying to hit the other one in the groin region
bouncers descend on them and pull them apart
carl and rooney are outside
carls nursing his wounds
they are very very drunk
you popped that guy
he didnt know what hit him
you do not cross carl kendall
the hot girl stumbles out of senor frogs
im sorry about domingo
he likes to think hes my boyfriend but hes not
the hot girl kisses carl
hot girl contd contd want to go some place private
light is streaming in through the window
carl opens his eyes
hes in bad shape
he looks over to see the hot girl finishing getting dressed
my fiance called
he was like really sorry about last night
i have to go
the guy who punched you in the face
i thought you said you two werent even dating
we were broken up last night
it was fun hanging out
the hot girl kisses carl on the forehead
hot girl contd i made some coffee
its in the kitchen
sorry for leading you on
the hot girl leaves
that was awesome
carl runs to the conference room
the just say yes seminar has been packed up
carl walks up to the counter
is there a sanji gupta staying here
carl walks down the hallway
he knocks on room
after a couple minutes of shuffling around sanji opens the door
the guy from yesterday
of course of course
please come in
carl comes into sanjis hotel room
sanji contd would you like a cup of coffee
i just wanted to thank you for that inspiration
so how do you plan on continuing with your journey
you know just living every day to its fullest
and like learning to continue to experience life or whatever
except for one suddenly intense you are completely bullshitting me
i just said im going to keep experiencing life
i thought youd be happy
youre like a cigarette addict carl
except youre addicted to boredom
on the way in here carl i offered you a coffee and you refused
perhaps that would have been the most delicious cup of coffee you would have ever had
whos to say
not you carl because you said no
anyone can quit smoking for a day
but for a lifetime
so what should i do
sanji pulls out a contract
behold carl the maniyesto
carl takes the maniyesto
reading the document until new years eve i must say yes
the yes cannot distort the truth
you cannot say yes the world is flat because that is an untruth
reading the document if someone discovers you are a yes man you do not have to say yes to them
to avoid yes you cannot avoid contact
therefore you must always answer your phone the door your postal mail your email etc and so on and so forth
you must choose a yesponsor to keep you on the straight and narrow
to sanji who should that be
a close friend who will not tell a soul
reading the document i hereby void the do you want loophole
to sanji what is that
if someone asks you do you want to go to the art museum and you do not want to you may not use this lack of desire as an excuse
to not go
and finally a warning
if you say no even once even for a cup of coffee be prepared to lose every single little thing youve gained
so what do you say carl
what do you say
carl signs the maniyesto
carl signs again
sanji contd and here
carl signs again
sanji contd and initial here
is this like a legal document
and finally my friend please hold out your hand
carl holds out his hand
sanji pulls out an iron brand thats been heating over a hot pot and brands carls palm
that should heal by new years
until then you are a yes man
carl looks at his palm
in the center of the palm sanjis branded a yes
carl is sitting across from peter
for a whole year
yesterday i got promoted and beat up and hooked up with this chick and i have a massive headache today and i still might throw up but i dont care
because it was the best time ive had in like forever
not to mention finding out that despite what you might think smoked whitefish in an omelette is delicious even if covered in a thick layer of pepper
but for a whole year
you dont understand
i got promoted
do you know how long ive been waiting for some kind of financial step forward
i said yes and it arrived
well someone sounds like theyre yuppifying their life
excuse me for wanting an appliance in my kitchen besides a hot pot
theres no way you can do this for a whole year
thats where you come in
youre my yesponsor
like in aa
i need you to hold me to it
you arent going to last for more than a week
i look forward to proving you wrong
peter and carl shake hands
carl contd nice suit
if i move up anymore at the bank i might need a few
silk and cotton blend
lucy comes over and kisses peter
my girlfriends are being such bitches
its been two weeks and no ones offered to throw me a wedding shower
thats too bad

peter turns to carl smiling

lucy hugs carl
carl looks over lucys shoulder at peter and shakes his head
rooney comes over

rooney points to four barflies sitting at the bar

carl walks up to the bar
peters snickering behind him
carl contd what kind of beer do you guys want
as long as youre buying i want a grey goose straight up
kir royale whatevers in that dusty bottle back there that you never take down
carl wakes up
he looks at the tattooed yes on his hand
carl goes through a series of junk mail flyers for credit cards
he very carefully fills each one of them out
carl walks into dunkin donuts
before the cashier can say anything
black coffee large
would you like
cutting her off to have a wonderful day
carl turns to see a giant poster with the words do you want a mocha caramel coolata
carl turns back to the cashier
carl contd and could i also have a mocha caramel coolata
with whipped cream
carl walks out of dunkin donuts carrying a frozen coffee drink and several boxes of munchkins
he walks by renee and wordlessly takes a flier
hey give that back
you already took one
whats the hurt in taking another
destroys the earth
also they cost me ten cents a copy
besides are you even going to come
i couldnt say no
as he walks away
carl contd even if i wanted to

carl sits at his cubicle and flips on his email
in the background we see various super happy employees eating the dunkin donuts that carl has brought
we see on the screen another email from the king of nigeria
dear deposed king of nigeria
i would love to help you anyway i can with your confidential transaction
please let me know what i can do

he checks the next email
carl contd would i like viagra

com and starts uploading his profile
norman walks by

carl looks to make sure normans not around then he stamps her form
high school girl contd thank you so much mr
carl walks down the street taking fliers from anyone who passes them out
we do quick cuts of him with various people as he walks down the street
i might have some stuff to pawn
i will definitely check out your gun selection
i would like to learn korean
if youre interested intro to korean is starting right now
carls sitting in a korean class with several businessmen
in korean with hello my name is carl
what is your name
carl stands at the back of a basically empty dive bar nursing a beer
theres a makeshift stage at the front of the bar
the flying buttresses are setting up their equipment including a giant clear plastic harp
renee steps up to the microphone
hello jake penelope carl and rodrigo
we are the flying buttresses
their four audience members cheer
the drummer bangs his sticks together and the band launches in
they are terrible
like really terrible
renee sings in a high pitched voice that she probably thinks sounds like tori amos but sounds more like a dog whistle
if youve heard the singer joanna newsom well thats who shes emulating
renee contd everyday the unicorns they play among lingonberry fields they silently bay the king has no crown just a vest of grass the queen loves the jester the jester
has the last laugh
you are my minotaur with your cloven hooves
half man half horse you are all boy to me carl looks at the three other audience members
they are nodding along
also one of them is dressed like a court jester
renees whisper singing
renee contd a witches cauldron burns hot as hell as her crooked hand brews a love spell
renees singing a power ballad
renee contd i
the four people in the audience clap hard as she finishes
renee takes a huge bow and motions to her fellow band mates
carl not knowing how to politely react to the horror show he just witnessed claps along
renee gets off the stage and walks over to the bar right next to carl
nice show renee
one virgin mint soda coming right up
i dont think i hit a high enough octave in fairy dream song
i think you hit some pretty high octaves
but i can hit like way higher
as she speaks her voice goes higher and higher like check this out
i think this tone might be more appropriate for my water nymph song
speaking in a low voice i dont know ive known some water nymphs with big balls
no reaction from the high level of testosterone
an awkward moment where renee doesnt react and carl thinks he may have offended her
suddenly she starts laughing spazzily hard
ive got to write a song about that
i could call it
big balled water nymph
its a working title
i like it
i can work with that
the drummer a guy named leeore shouts down to renee from the stage
um excuse me but we have to clear the stage
i gotta clear
unless of course you want to help
i love clearing stages
carl helps a surprised renee clear the stage
carl has helped renee fit the giant harp into the back of her ancient volvo
well thanks for coming carl
i must bid good night
i lead a jogging photo group for people who want to both exercise and practice photography
youre a photographer too
amateur but yeah
i show every friday
renee contd if you want to do some artistic calisthenics join us tomorrow
what time do you leave
so we can see the sunrise
i havent seen the sunrise maybe ever
i guess now ill be doing that tomorrow
oh its beautiful

nice meeting you carl
renee gets in her volvo and drives off
carl walks off
you interested in learning spanish
carl takes the flier from the flier guy
carl walks down the street now holding a zillion fliers
carl gets a tap on the shoulder
reveal kath standing there
thinking of learning a couple foreign languages
would you like one
im going to learn swahili
maybe next week
theres someone you should probably meet
carl this is seb
a very tall very blond nordic looking man approaches carl
what is that
seb puts his hand on kaths back
carl notices this and is not particularly happy
seb contd ive heard a lot about you carl
sebs phone rings
seb contd sorry sweetie
ive got to take this
seb walks off and answers his cell
youre on a date then
met him at my firm
hes very tall
i guess so yeah
well it was nice meeting you seb
so ill be going
carl starts to walk off
youd like to join us
carl stops in his tracks
he mouths the word fuck
kath nods at carl as in you dont have to join us
seb contd it was good meeting you id love to
join you guys
seb carl and kath are sitting at dinner
it is incredibly awkward
kath and seb are clearly incredibly pissed off
so how did you guys meet
i told you
through the firm
a waiter arrives
would you like to order some wine
cut to later carl kath and seb are now slightly drunk
however it is a quiet angry drunk not a fun loving drunk
they are still sitting in silence
seb turns to kath and starts saying something quietly to her
oh this is good
i was walking past pizza hut the other day and for a second i was sure the sign said pizza hat
and then i thought wouldnt it be funny if there was a shop that sold hats shaped like pizzas
beat weakly you know
because it sounds like pizza hut only its a hat shop
look carl why dont you just eat your fish and fuck off
carl puts the rest of his meal in his mouth gets up from the table and walks out of the restaurant
as he leaves he smiles to himself
his phone rings
he sees its rooney on the caller id
carl answers the phone
whats up carl
what do you say we grab a couple brewskis
carl flips on his computer
he has a bunch of emails
he clicks on the email
dear brother carl thank you for your last note you sent me
but we must move quickly
i must have your bank details right now
send them to me
your associate omar king of nigeria while typing dear omar while i appreciate the gravity of your situation perhaps a goodwill branch is in order
could you perhaps loan me a million and take it out of my final cut
then i will happily send you my bank details
carl then flips on persianwifefinder
a persian cartoon genie comes onto the screen
you have sixty five winks
the screen is suddenly filled with pictures of persian women
carls alarm goes off
carl hits it and sits up
he grabs his head and then runs to the bathroom and throws up
renee along with several other amateur photographers in sweat suits have gathered
they all have big cameras around their necks
carl walks up to them
he does not look good
you look tired
well it is five in the morning
mammals are meant to be up at dawn
its how were built biologically
wheres your camera
carl realizes he forgot his camera
i thought id use my phone
carl pulls out his camera cell phone
thats what i thought
lets hit it
renee carl and the group of amateur jogging photographers start jogging
carl can barely keep up with them
renee contd oooh pretty
as she passes a flower renee snaps a photo of it
the group reaches the lake as the sun rises
they all snap photos
carl finds himself snapping photos on his camera
he accidentally snaps one of renee with the sun behind her
she looks pretty in the photo
enough standing around
renee starts jogging again
carl starts after her and then abruptly doubles over and throws up on the ground
renee and the other jogging photographers snap photos of him
carl sits across from an iranian women
it was delightful meeting you carl
as it was meeting you farinoush
although i must say i was surprised to discover that you are in no way persian
nor are you six foot two
you should change that on your profile
should i call you
sorry i want a tall guy
the iranian woman leaves passing lucy
who was that
great girl but i dont think were right for each other
howd you meet
ignoring her odd look lets talk wedding shower
so i know its just a wedding shower so who cares really
and its like so lame
but ive made an appointment at a stationery store
are you going to totally kill me
dripping with sarcasm you kidding
i love stationery
lucy gets up
carl follows her
he does not look happy
lucy and carl are looking over a book of stationery with the stationery proprietess
carl cant concentrate
this one is nice
i especially love it in cream
what do you think
looks good to me
sarcastic annoyance thanks for your opinion
its always difficult to get the husband to bes opinion
derisive laughter im not marrying him
im just helping throw the shower
whats the party going to be like
sometimes it helps to know that before you pick an invitation
just hors doeuvres and wine
carl meanwhile is looking through the book of invitations
look at this bridal bingo
whats bridal bingo
its bingo except you yell out embarrassing facts about the bride and whoever fills their card first wins
that sounds fun
im not doing bridal bingo
how about a calendar shower
can we concentrate at the task at hand
do you even know what a calendar shower is
maybe a calendar shower is awesome
every guest gets assigned a month and brings a gift that the bride and groom can use during that month
thats kind of cute
i think thats really cute
carls starting to get really into it
he turns the page and sees an invitation decorated with animals labeled knights in white armor
carl contd look at this one knights in white armor
the bride and groom ride in on a white stallion
you have got to do that
like its not even a choice
that seems a little extreme
you only get married once
your friend happens to be right
youre really good at this
you mind helping me with the wedding invitations
carls sitting across from an arab guy at the loan desk
i love cell phones
i breathe cell phones
i own myself thirty five cell phones
my brother is an idiot and hes selling cell phones hand over fist
what do you have
the arab guy goes to grab carls phone
he sees the photo of renee on the phones wallpaper
arab guy contd oooh pretty lady
carl grabs his phone back
how much do you need
eighty five hundred
carl stamps his form
i was with my sister
and we had this lemonade stand
and we sold like a hundred cups of lemonade in two days
and so i want to expand
ten year old girl contd all i need is three thousand dollars
carl stamps her form
just give me the cash
you promise youll pay it back
carl stamps his form
norman comes over
may i speak to you carl
norman sits across from carl
i know what youre doing
what am i doing
youre loaning below our minimum
carl doesnt know what to say
norman contd you thought i wouldnt notice the paperwork
im not the regional manager because i ignore the details
im sorry but its absurd that if you need a small amount of money you have to go to a loan shark
only rich people can pay back loans over ten grand
a banks job is not to just help the rich
its to help anyone with a dream achieve it
these microloans are pretty interesting
so ill you spearhead a little pilot program at the bank
thank you so much
if corporate finds out youre the one whos getting fired
so keep it quiet
carl mimes zipping up his mouth and throwing away the key
rooney sits down across from carl
what do you need a loan for
i was wondering if you were around tonight to help me move
why dont you hire movers
because its cheaper to ask you
rooney and carl are looking at a fridge
can you carry the fridge alone
moments later carl is carrying the fridge down the stairs
he falls down the stairs with the fridge
carl looks up at rooney whos at the top of the stairs
do you want to help at all
i wish i could but i hurt my back trying to move that fridge
carl has put the last box into the moving van
rooney and his mom are hugging
im going to miss you baby
and im going to miss you ma
i cant watch you go
his mom goes into her house
where are you moving
rooney looks at carl and smiles
carls eyes go wide
music cue jump by the pointer sisters carls taking korean
carl contd in korean what is the weather like in pyongyang
at southwest bank
we need a volunteer to think up local marketing ideas carl raises his hand
carl has put up signs on the bank window that say pet a puppy day
theres a box of puppies in the bank
customers are streaming into the bank to pet puppies
we see carls calendar filling up
a ton of different kinds of credit cards are popping carls taking spanish
in spanish i like to drive with my mother
the door to the language center opens
carl walks towards work
he sees the same group of flyer guys and ducks down an alleyway
we now see that to avoid the flyer guys he uses a series of alleys and fire escapes crossing roofs even jumping between two buildings so he can avoid being
at southwest bank
we need someone to be a weekend cashier
carls hand shoots up
carl walks out of a movie with a woman whos in a head scarf
he awkwardly hugs her
reveal that the movie they watched is saw iii
carls at the note singing along to renees bands songs
he and the jester audience member do shots together
carls walking around a florist shop with lucy
she points to a small bouquet of white flowers
carl points to a giant heart shaped ice sculpture
we see carl having to write in tiny letters on his calendar because its so full
at southwest bank
norman contd we need a volunteer carls hand shoots up
norman contd to be in charge of day care
cut to carl with a bunch of kids
all the kids are folding brand new dollar bills into paper airplanes
cut to carl walking down the street a big smile on his face taking everyones fliers as per usual
he walks past a culty guy named tony whos passing out books
do you want to change your life through mahayana buddhism
carl takes one of the books
tony contd would you like to have tea and discuss
im kind of in a rush
my place is right around the corner
carls sitting awkwardly on the floor across from tony
they are both drinking tea
it is only through the four noble truths and the destruction of desire that we can end suffering
well thats really neat
awkward beat so thanks for the books and the jasmine tea and the vegan curry but i have to go do you like dionne warwick
tony flips on dionne warwicks i say a little prayer
tony contd now she had style
it was really great meeting you cmon carl
shake your groove thang
tony pulls carl up
carl starts to awkwardly shake his groove thing
tony contd i like big guys
i really have to go
tony grabs carl and kisses him full on the lips
want to go into my bedroom
close in on carls face
he looks down on the yes thats on his palm
very quiet yes
carl and tony head into his bedroom
do you have any candles
i just love candles
tony instantly pulls out candles and lights them
how about wine
like a bottle of beaujolais
i only have beaujolais nouveau
tony pulls out a bottle of wine and two glasses
tony goes in to kiss carl
i have herpes
upstairs or downstairs
front door or back door
its a swinging door
just give it
tony pushes carl down onto the bed
carls sitting across from peter in peters fancy law office
theyre each eating burgers
whats with the kitten
pull back to reveal a kitten on peters desk
i just adopted her
if youre interested theyre giving them away in front of petco
i dont want a kitten
neither did i
andy solomon on line two
peter picks up the phone
hey asshole were not talking until you sign that goddamn contract
peter hangs up
peter contd totally normal i spoke to kath
i hear you met her boyfriend seb
seems like a nice guy
she was upset you went on her date
he asked me to join them
i think youre taking this too far
i have no choice
im a yes man
i must say yes
if seb asks me to join them on their date i must
if some dude asks me for a loan i have to give it to them even if its clearly never going to be paid back
if a guy asks me into his bedroom i must hook up with him
you hooked up with a dude
its like hooking up with a strong woman
i honestly dont see what the big deal is
back on his yes rant i am guided by yes
yes has become my superpower
and let me tell yes is turning out to be a pretty sweet deal
now if youll excuse me im late for korean class
you hate korean food
thats no reason to write off an entire vibrant culture
see you later buddy
carl heads off the kitten under his arm
carl walks around a photography gallery
renees photos are up
they are terrible photos since they were taken while she was jogging
their subjects are blurry
some of them are half in the photo and half out
the featured photo is of carl throwing up on the ground
you really are displaying that
thats probably my best photo ever
my collages arent bad
but personally i think i excel at pottery
renee points to a large brown plate that looks like poo
thats really big
how do you have time for all this stuff
how do you have time to come to every one of my rocks shows even the one in fairfield county that was seventy five miles from here
i almost skipped that one
you gave me the flier so i had to go
at first i thought you were a weird stalker and i was scared
but now i think youre just a really shy dude with a crush
and while its been suspenseful to see when if youd ask me out do you want to go out sometime
yes i would
by the way i do other stuff besides follow you around
i take korean
in that case what do you say we do korean
carls eating across from renee
he cant stand the food
he grimaces with every bite but manages to choke it down
do you want any more squid hot pot
its really good here
i think im good
to have some more
renee spoons a huge amount of squid onto both their plates
carl contd so all this art you create
what do you want to do with it
what do you mean
like do you want to open a store
where i can sell my photos and pottery
of course not
carls surprised that she knows this
theyre not terrible
yeah theyre awful
i think youre being hard on yourself im not asking for sympathy
my voice is way too high pitched my pottery looks like poo and my photos are blurry and subjectless
but who gives a shit
not everything needs a goal
the world is a playground
you know that as a kid but then somewhere along the way everyone forgets
renee contd as if telling a secret besides i cant open a store
my big master plan is to take a trip around the world
like in a couple years
i bought a ticket for four months from now
people always talk about that but youre actually doing it
honestly im terrified
how about you
do you like the bank
its lame but you know its pretty funny
my boss norman always throws theme parties
so if its lame why do you work there
its actually not lame
i just gave the answer ive automatically given for years
im actually enjoying the bank for the first time maybe ever
i started this pilot program that gives out microloans
like say you need three hundred bucks to pay for paint so you can start a house painting business
rather than paying a loan shark who charges you now you can come to southwest bank
its kind of dorky
that actually sounds really cool
the waitress comes over
renee contd im stuffed
but i would love to wrap this up
in korean with we are very fat
but can i please have this food made mobile
so what do you say we hit this crazy party
funny not crazy
my boss is white noise
you know like totally boring
i dont know anyone whos totally boring
crack a persons shell theres always something creepy underneath
norman opens the door
hes dressed as the japanese character hiro from the show heroes
or should i say uerukamu
whats going on
i wouldnt bother
you didnt tell her
this is a dress up as your favorite character from heroes
do you watch
i currently dont have a television
norman stares at her
i dont know what to do with that information
there are drinks chips dips various and sundry noshes
i entreat you to make friends
lets get this party started
its very quiet
a couple people mill about
we dont have to stay long
its a party
carl and renee walk up to a mousey girl
this is renee
its complete silence
khatoon contd do i know you from somewhere
i dont think so
are you listed on persianwifefinder
carl fake laughs with her
khatoon contd seriously though are you
so how do you know norman
norman comes in with more chips
there are now about ten times as many snacks as guests
baked lays people
it is on
youre in a karate club
everyones standing around norman
theyve laid several pieces of wood out over a coffee table
norman karate chops the wood in half
the guests cheer
norman takes a big bow
whispering to carl told ya there was something weird under that white noise shell
renee leaves carl
youre totally on persianwifefinder
carl turns to norman
changing the subject khatoon norman
you guys should spar
khatoon and norman start to spar
carl sits back smiling
jason a cynical guy whos slightly drunk sidles up beside carl
well isnt that cute
weve got a full match on
hey im jason
they shake hands
what do you do
work for the ins
i hate it
everyday i have to dash some poor guys dream
im a professional dream dasher
it cant be that bad
the other day i turned down a guy who had literally been a professor at the university of cuba
jasons sitting across from a cuban professor
but ive already lived here for five years
ive received a steady paycheck and paid taxes for five years
i speak fluent english
i cant go back
im sorry but no can do
ive passed the citizenship test ten times
i bet you couldnt pass that test
youre probably right
do you know the location of the spanish american war
you are an insult to your country
so did you let him in
i sent him back to cuba
i send them all back
if you hate your job so much why do you do it
because i have to eat
to himself in wonder youre a no man
carl makes a difficult decision
im not supposed to tell anyone this except for my yesponsor but you can change your life
ive changed mine
if i tell you how will you promise not to tell anyone
sarcastically whispering yeah sure whatever
i say yes
say yes more
its that simple
jason finishes his drink
thats the most retarded idea ive ever heard
jason heads off
what did i miss
do you want to go
carl and renee walk into carls apartment
ten kittens and puppies come running up to them as they enter
you work for the aspca
i just love pets
this is veronica king george owen carl jr
carl the iii carl iv bubbles greedo cat cat and cat
at the end there i got kind of bored of naming them
they walk into carls living room bedroom
the room is piled floor to ceiling with boxes
renee starts to go through the boxes
you dont need to do that
you have a lot of mexican viagra
i have a congenital heart thing it helps
and its cheaper than the stuff thats made here
you better not be a criminal
because one time i dated this guy who jacked cars for a living and i did not enjoy living on the edge as much as i thought i would
its cheaper to buy in bulk
is that a crime
a hundred boxes of mexican prescription drugs borders on something vaguely criminal
renee contd well are you going to make out with me or what
carl grabs renee and starts making out with her
they fall onto the bed
reveal rooney watching them
you must be renee
i have heard so much about you
can i watch
carl doesnt know what to say
before he has to say yes
no you cant watch
renee and carl lie next to each other
you know what i would love
i give great massages
carl starts massaging her
oooh right there
renee contd dont stop
carl continues massaging her
carls still massaging her
renee contd can you please keep massaging
carl starts massaging again
his hands are really cramping up
he stops massaging
renee contd while asleep please keep massaging please
carl starts massaging again wincing while he does it
carls sitting across from a large man
carls hands are like claws
a line of people waits to speak with him
how much does a schwinn cost
three hundred fifty three dollars
itll really help me get my one hour delivery business off the ground
ive tried on foot
i only have a two mile radius
done and done
carl stamps the package
norman comes over to the loan desk
hey the boys upstairs are here to speak with you
because i have a thing at one
he asked for you specifically
ixnay on the small loans ay
carl looks over
he sees the president from the beginning of the movie sitting in the conference room
carl gets nervous
carl walks into the conference room
the bank president chris parker motions to a seat
im chris parker
president of southwest bank
i actually met you when i was just a teller
no recollection of it at of course
reading from a binder pet a puppy day
free cookie day
free half hour on the banks punching bag day
youve upped walk in traffic by
not only that youve also taken charge of corporate day care
i like a team player
carls phone buzzes
the caller id says lucy
but then i got suspicious
what drives a man in his mid to late thirties whos still at the absolute lowest level of our corporate family
or raging revenge
which is when i got the numbers from your loan desk
carl turns white
carls phone buzzes again
the text says uh huh
youve given out over below minimum loans
one of them was literally for fifteen dollars and eighty seven cents
janice peabodys ant farm rental business
how do you explain yourself
ive started a microloan project
i figure that if someone needs less than ten grand why should they go to a loan shark when they can come to a legitimate banking institution
because the paperwork makes any profit moot
unless youre raiding our coffers
i wouldnt do that
i would if i could so why wouldnt you
chris abruptly stops laughing
so does carl
carls phone buzzes again
the text says chris parker contd but then i looked closer at the numbers
of the loan recipients have been paying them off according to the banks schedule
not just that but of that group have returned as regular full loan customers
this is both a moneymaker and good for the community
that like never happens
youre the kind of person we want in corporate
were taking some clients on a golfing trip
you free tomorrow
of course you are
i better watch my back around you carl kendall
soon youll be taking my job
see you on the links
chris parker grabs carls hand and shakes it
carl runs out of the office
carl runs up to the bakery
im sorry bank meeting stuff
lucy and carl wander around a fancy bakery
ive never heard of a wedding shower cake
you have to have one
modern bride calls them a necessity
carls phone rings
carl contd sorry luce
sotto into phone yeah i can definitely be at the blood bank in twenty minutes
carl hangs up
lucy suddenly starts crying
carl contd are you ok
im sorry its just youve been so great at all this while my husband to be has been completely absent
do you have time to grab a cup of tea
carl and lucy are each drinking tea
the only other people in the tea room are groups of women
is he scared to get married
is that why he doesnt care
you know peter
hes a mans man
he cares he just doesnt know how to show it
you know how to show it
a wedding is a huge deal
im so scared
you guys are perfect for each other
i know that and yet im still so scared
maybe if youre just honest with him about how youre feeling itll be ok
he can be just so closed off
carls phone rings
sorry the bank you know
sotto into phone the ufo conference is tonight
no thats fine ill definitely be there
carl hangs up
carl contd im sorry
youve been so good to me
ive really come to depend on you
i want to pay you back
peter tells me you might have some disposable income these days
for some reason the bank keeps promoting me
if you want to look at some open houses im happy to waive my fee
carl and lucy walk into a luxurious apartment
gourmet kitchen floor to ceiling windows giant media center
so this is at the very top end of what you could probably afford
are you interested
carl hits a button
a giant television screen descends
are you sure
i mean this is the first place youve looked yes
ive got to run
im looking forward to meeting renee tonight
were all having dinner
carl runs out
carl giving blood while on the phone
on the phone i just think if were going to be rolling out a no interest financing campaign we should commit hard
he checks his watch
the nurse walks by
carl contd covering the phone can you unhook me
i have a really important meeting
if youre interested in donating plasma feel free to sign up
carls listening to a lecture
between and englands ministry of defence paid security cleared experts to research ufos
this classified study was code named project condign
carls phone rings
people look angrily at him
he stands and passes out in the aisle
carl pulls up and runs inside
his friends are all waiting
carl pulls renee aside

i do volunteer work at a shelter
i teach esl
i do balloon animal art
you know a little of this a little of that
you should check out her pottery
its really big
it is big
how about you guys
real estate broker
the conversations not exactly flowing easily
if youll excuse me
the waiter comes over
have you made a decision about the wine
well were kind of in a celebratory mood
in that case may i suggest a petit rothschild
the waiter points at a wine that costs a bottle
maybe we should wait for peter to decide
he doesnt know crap about wine
just pick one carl
carl is sweating bullets
with six people id recommend two bottles
everyones drinking the wine
carls terrified of the bill
do you rent or own
i have this corner of a loft
its a really nice corner though
if youre ever interested in buying you should ring me up
i hate owning things
because when you own something you suddenly are invested in that thing not breaking
and i break everything
ive gone through three tvs in three years
how did you break them
i smashed one with a hammer dropped one off my roof and the third one just went on the fritz
so i set it on fire
carls friends dont really know what to say
the check comes
carl grabs it before anyone else can
its a bill
he drops several credit cards down on the table
its on me
quietly to the waiter id like to split it between an advanta blue business mastercard a diners club and my south dakota bank visa check card
carls outside with peter
nice job with renee
shes definitely odd but thats not necessarily
i just spent on dinner
because the waiter asked me if i wanted the expensive wine and you werent there to stop me
dont get mad at me about it
you can just stop
no i cant
if i didnt say yes to the band flier i never would have met renee
if i hadnt said yes to taking charge of bank day care and then yes to becoming a loan specialist and then yes to the presidents golf trip i wouldnt
be moving up
each yes leads to the next one
if i stop it could all fall apart
youve gone from a passive guy who always said no to a passive guy who always says yes
just saying yes is not a legitimate life philosophy
i dont know why i should be taking advice from a guy whos wife is pissed hes not involved at all with the wedding planning
you told her you dont care whether the invites cream or ivory
i cant see the difference
opening up honestly im terrified
its marriage you know
the biggest thing ever
but you guys have dated for years
youre perfect for each other
shes terrified too
of course she is
i think youll both be a lot less terrified if youre terrified together
but what if i really cant tell the difference between ivory and cream
does that make me a bad husband
what matters is that you pretend you can see the difference
the girls and seb come out from the restaurant with their coats on
theres a silent beat
high pitched goodbyes it was wonderful meeting you
i loved it
let me know when you throw your next art thing
everyone gets into their cars
carl and renee walk off
it was great meeting your friends
theyre a little stiff
they are a little stiff
what do you feel like doing
im actually going rollerblading with ralph
you know crazy rollerblading guitar man
the guy who plays at the promenade
its ten on a friday night
and that guys crazy
dont you want to go home and make out
carl and renee are making while carl surreptitiously checks his watch
finally renee stops kissing him
carl and crazy rollerblading guitar man rollerblade down the street while guitar man plays guitar
which is why the merman is not to be trusted especially with the fishermans computer brain
that is really good to know
you want to come see the merman
carl dashes in covered in spots of paint
what happened to you
carls playing really intense terrifying paintball with norman and rooney
i do this whole habitat for humanity thing
i love the concept of charity
a group of korean gentleman approach carl and chris
chris parker contd this is carl kendall
this is jin kim joo chan park soo lee and seung kim
seungs the ceo of korean bank international
the koreans shake carls hand
in korean with it is an honor to meet you
do you like america
the koreans all start speaking korean at carl
carl clearly doesnt understand what theyre saying
chris and carl follow the koreans
you speak korean
just a little
you sneaky devil
i knew i should watch my back around you
is it a problem if ive never played golf before
youre a funny one carl kendall
remember they have to win
in asian cultures theres a concept called saving face
you have to let them win
but if they smell for a second that you havent tried your hardest theyll commit hari kari
its a delicate balance kendall
like two little girls on a see saw with a crocodile beneath them
make the wrong move and the little girl will end up in the crocs maw
carl stands with the koreans
seung kim is speaking very rapidly at carl
carl has no idea what hes saying
seung kim laughs
carl laughs along with him
chris hits a beautiful shot
his ball lands almost on the green
the koreans notice and nervously chatter
chris approaches carl
its all you
carl grabs a nine iron from the golf bag
everyone seems very impressed
chris parker contd you must have quite a powerful stroke
in korean to carl good luck my friend
in korean i shall need the luck
this is my first time playing
seung kim laughs
carl contd under his breath why does everyone think im joking
carl gingerly places the golf ball on the tee
he looks towards the hole
carl contd thats really far
carl lines up his shot
he swings back then forward and plows the club into the grass knocking the ball off the tee
the ball rolls down a slight incline resting just a couple feet from where carl hit it
carl contd in korean to seung kim youre up seung kim
carl walks back to where chris is at
what was that
just keeping them on their toes
tiger woods does it
seung kim raises his club back
he too dubs it driving the club deep into the grass
his ball rolls just a couple feet past carl
carl hits the ball straight into a group of trees
seung kim standing right in front of a pond delicately taps his ball right into the pond
carl keeps divoting the grass
he divots so many times that he has to move the ball out of the holes hes accidentally dug
seung kim hits his ball out of the sand trap
it rolls back in
he tries again
it rolls back in
hes about to try again when carl picks up his ball and tosses it over the lip of the sand trap
carl holds his finger up to his lips shhh
carls about to hit the ball when his phone rings
he answers it
carl contd of course not
the other golfers look really impatient
carl contd male
i prefer light beer
three to five times a week
carl holds up his finger
only one moment
its getting late
now both carl and seung kim are hitting their balls at once to save time
they are both running and hacking at their balls across the fairway as if theyre playing a deranged game of field hockey
carl is counting up the scores
chris you hit a
i bogied the fifth hole
im still pissed about that
joo chan hit a
as for seung kim
seung glowers at carl
carl contd and as for me i hit
doing some computations
seung kim pumps his fist
im sorry to say that team korean bank international has won
seung kim slaps five with his compatriots
carl chris and the koreans are all hanging out
carl is alone in the corner of the conference hall
a pretty female korean banker approaches carl
in korean you are quite the golfer
in korean i golf from crotch noodle
he laughs along with her
in korean i have a business proposition for you
my marriage is not a happy one
i often find my needs are left unsatisfied
in korean i agree
the weather is sunny
in korean i wish that was so
in english kiss me
carl doesnt know what to do
she kisses him passionately
carl breaks away from the kiss
am i not sexy
have you not heard of saving face
youre very sexy
carl and the korean banker kiss more
carl looks guilty
carls shaking hands with the korean bank representatives
chris shakes carls hand
im promoting you to bank manager
pulling carl close ive got my eye on you boy

carl nervously laughs along with him
the pretty korean banker walks by and waves at him
carl waves back
he looks very guilty
carl walks into the pottery studio looking guilty
renee is making a giant piece of pottery
whats up chicken butt
off his guilty look
renee contd are you ok

carl considers whether he should say anything about the kiss
i just got promoted to bank manager
renee kisses carl
renee contd oooh we should do some sexy pottery

carl goes to grab some clay
i was kidding

oh no you probably already had some today
no we just had american food american fare

i wish we could just go to the airport and hop on the first flight outta here
carls eyes light up
renee and carl are in line at the ticketing counter
with an english accent i think were going to london
with a spanish accent oaxaca senorita
with a russian accent moscow russia comrade
with an unidentifiable singapore
what was that
my singaporean accent

they get to the front of the line
carl contd we want two tickets on the next plane out of here

carl and renee take the tickets
acting positive lincoln nebraska
here we come baby
thatll be twelve hundred and thirty three dollars
maybe we shouldnt do this
ive been promoted
ive got money to burn
carl nervously hands the airline rep his credit card
carls walking towards security when he runs into tony the homosexual guy he hooked up with
tonys handing out his books
do you want to change your life through mahayana buddhism
carl takes one of the books
tony contd carl
carl realizes who he is
suddenly they are in the middle of an awkward ex lover interaction
howve you been

yeah well ive been busy too
renee comes up and grabs carls arm
hey whos your friend
tony looks at renee and realizes that shes carls girlfriend
renee contd im renee

dripping with bitterness have fun
carl and renee head off
renee and carl have the aisle and window on the plane
a young woman comes up to carl
would you mind switching places with me
i want to be across the aisle from my mom
her mom is indeed across from carl
were actually flying together
it would really mean a great deal
shes very scared of flying
wheres your seat
the young woman points at her seat
its a couple rows up in the middle
her middle seats bookended by a mom with a screaming baby and an enormous man
carl contd this is an aisle
thats a middle
renee looks at carl like why wont you just refuse
im really scared of flying
carl between the crying baby and the enormous man
renee turns and waves to him from a couple rows up
carl puts on a saccharin smile and waves back
carl and renee are in the airport
so now that were here what should we do
well clearly we should go there
carl points to an advertisement for a telephone museum come to the frank h
woods telephone pioneer museum
carl and renee are looking at mannequins of nineteenth century switchboard operators
its incredibly quiet
i had no idea that the earliest switchboard operator headsets weighed ten and a half pounds
that is fascinating
not at all
an elderly tour guide dressed as a telephone operator approaches
in character ill connect you to the coast in an instant with alexander graham bells brand new invention the telephone
just a haypenny per ten minutes
out of character
elderly tour guide contd this place is boring as shit
check out the lester f
larsen tractor test power museum
now thats an attraction
ask for billy
she hands carl a brochure
carl and renee stand outside
we dont have to do this
we might as well
carl and renee ride a tractor
renees taking photos as they the driver turns up the speed
theyre suddenly going crazy fast
carl takes the wheel
the tractor immediately gets away from him
they swerve straight and crash through the wall of an old barn
the driver kills the engine
renee carl and the driver catch their breath
theres uhh no power steering
its a tractor not a toyota
im sorry about the barn
been meaning to tear this sucker down anyway
carl and renee walk around a surprisingly pretty city park
i think i might have whiplash from that tractor ride
just dont sue me
watch your back carl
i mean it
im very litigious
this day has been so randomly incredible
travel around the world with me
i mean i know we havent really been seeing each other for that long but i dont know
i think im falling you know
before our flight what do you say we grab a couple nebraskan steaks
im definitely falling for you
carls sitting in the lounge at the lincoln airport
an old woman comes up to him
would you mind bringing this to my son
the old woman hands carl an unmarked shady looking package
like you want me to bring it with me
on the plane
fedex is so expensive and this needs to get to him today
very nervous yeah
id be happy to
hes a tall blond fellow named sheldon winkleton
hell be holding a sign in the terminal with his name on it
you are a dear
the old woman shuffles off
carl looks at the box
i got us weekly star and for a little culture the national enquirer
they have movie reviews
whats in the package
just a gift for some buddies back home
carl walks through security
he puts the package on the conveyor belt
they dont notice anything odd
carl and renee sit next to each other on the plane
im sorry i have to go to the bathroom
renee heads to the bathroom
carl takes the package out from under the seat in front of him
he starts to breathe really hard
he very gingerly opens the package
he pulls back the packing peanuts revealing
a box of homemade chocolates
carl breathes a sigh of relief
carl and renee walk off the plane carl carrying the package under his arm
carl sees a tall blond guy holding a sign that says sheldon winkleton
he heads towards the guy but before he can several dea agents with adorable drug sniffing dogs surround carl
the dogs start barking like mad
put the package down
put it down
carl looks up to see sheldon walking swiftly out the sliding doors of the airport
dea agent contd get on the ground
both of you
the dea agents kick the box open
chocolates spill out over the ground
they crack open the chocolates to reveal tiny what the hell is that
i dont know
as carl is dragged out by the cops he passes tony standing near the exit shaking his head
carls sitting across from two dea agents good cop bob and bad cop bob
and im bob
carl cant help but laugh
bad cop bob contd do you find that funny
carl sees his hand with yes on it
just let the girl go
she doesnt know anything
well see about that carl
some old lady gave me a package in the lincoln airport to deliver to her son sheldon winkleton
that was really stupid of me and i realize that now
i dont know anything about anything
just answer a few questions and im sure well get this all sorted out
have you ever used illegal drugs
carl stares at them
he should probably lie
but thats all
how about shrooms
but thats the only bad shit ive done
never cheated on a girlfriend
yes i have
but i was in high school
i was a mess
she had cheated on me the bad cop slams his fist down on the table
you disgust me
the good cop restrains the bad cop
the two cops discuss carl
we see carl freaking out through the one way mirror behind them as they talk
hes a moron
but i think hes telling the truth
no one ever admits to the cheating question
carls sitting on the steps
renee comes out of the station
what the hell happened
i can explain
are you a drug smuggler
look when the nice lady asked me to take them on the plane i thought they were chocolates
you expect me to believe a nice lady asked you to bring chocolates on a plane
i know how it sounds
i dont think you do
carl just looks at her
renee contd if you cant be honest with me then you and the nice lady can have a fun life in candyland
renee starts off
ill explain better
she turns back around
carl sits across from renee
so youve just been saying yes to everything
pardon the pun
do you get it now
its nothing just a glitch really
i thought we had so much in common but if you just yes to everything i dont know that we do
how do i know if you even like korean food
do you even want to travel around the world at all or do you want to work at that bank and buy a lot of prada suits
something registers in renee
when i asked if you were falling for me all you said was yes
she rises shaking her head and heads for the door
it wasnt a lie
carls strapped to a giant plasma donation machine
as he donates plasma he could not look more depressed
itll be over soon
i dont care
just take it all
carl stumbles into the lounge outside chriss office
chris will be with you in a moment
would you like something to drink
carl walks into chriss office carrying a cup of coffee a diet coke and a bottle of water
so i got a call from the police department
im not a drug dealer chris closes the door to his office
i spent a couple years in prison myself
so i backdated some stock options
excuse me for trying to help our bottom line right
you got to do what you got to do to help mr
we are their slaves
honestly i prefer for all my top guys to have been in the big house
weve all eaten the slop
theres a trust there you cant break
chris holds out his hand
chris parker contd so what do you say to being a vp and expanding your microloan program bankwide
carl shakes chriss hand
carls office has views of other corporate parks
despite the fancy digs carls depressed
chris pokes his head in
carls on the phone
on the phone thats right were dropping the minimum loan to one dollar bank wide
could you look through these numbers and let me know which of our five branches have been lagging behind in profit
chris dumps a folder on carls desk
i thought i was just implementing the microloan program
youre a vp buddy
you do it all now
carls taking a pottery lesson
he is sadly going through the motions of making a pot
he checks his watch and departs leaving the unfinished pot spinning on the pottery wheel
the vps are sitting around the board room
carl comes in late still covered in clay
sorry about that
carl im glad you could join us
so to keep you all updated we should be merging with korean bank international within the year
chris parker contd as per our argument with kbi well be shoring up our bottom line
carl kendalls done us the honor of drawing up a preliminary list of the branches that are on the chopping block
nice work carl
carl looks horrified
carls in the middle of a heated discussion with chris
you cant close the maple branch
i know that maples where you got your start but if i dont lay those people off then i get laid off
its a vicious cycle
you dont have to if you dont want to
deadly serious if we dont close these branches than kbi will buy our competitor instead of us and put us all out of business
if you want to be an executive and get to do fun stuff like your microloan project then you also have to be the bad guy who lays people off
thats why we get paid the big bucks
to make the hard decisions
rooneys getting worked up
the banks all ive got
every morning i restock the hard candy polish the safe write todays interest rates on the board
there are other banks
we have to protest the merger
get some grassroots action going
grass looks weak but it grows everywhere
you dont even work at the bank
you should protest with us
protest with your employees
it will only make you more popular
southwest bank employees and carl stand in a picket line outside the corporate offices
we wont go
we wont go
chris gets out of his car and heads to the office
carl hides his face from chris so that chris wont recognize him
throw a rock at him
yeah throw a rock
carl grabs a rock and very delicately lobs it in chriss direction
he then takes off running in the opposite direction
he then circles around and runs into the back entrance of the bank
we follow carl as he runs up the service entrance to the corporate offices
carl then runs into his office and sits down at the desk
hes covered in sweat and is breathing heavily
chris pokes his head in
some asshole protestor threw a rock at my head
i wish using hoses wasnt such bad chris leaves his office
carl sits across from peter
i think i made a mistake letting renee go like that
what if im supposed to go on that trip
you own an apartment because of that job
people dont generally leave good jobs
but the bank doesnt feel right
peters phone rings
peter picks it up
i think we should go with the tulips
i know roses are more romantic but theyre also much more cliched
babe can you wait a second
covering the phone im going to be on for a while
ask your guru
hes the one who sent you on this retarded quest in the first place
sanjis signing books
carl gets to the front of the line
no memory of carl of course
would you like to purchase my new book the power of yes life is yessy
actually i had a question for you
well this line is for book customers only
sanjis eating by himself
carl comes up to him
im sorry to bother you again cant you see that im eating
i have a really important question
i have to choose between traveling around the world with a girl im really into or choosing a job that will make me pretty well off
i dont know which yes to take
how well off
i dont know why thats important
i should know all the data
a lot ok
this is what i recommend
every winter i throw a two week long seminar in aspen
its only ten grand a week and it will open your mind up i dont want to go to a seminar
i just need help with this question
for you eight grand a week
i have helped celebrities like cher and jack welch
you will love it youre a total con artist
i am not a con artist
have i not set you on the life path you desire
ive put my life into the hands of a con artist
and because of you i have this retarded yes branded on my hand for life
yelling to the this man is a con artist
dont listen to this man
he is a con artist
carl runs out of the restaurant
carl returns home
rooneys on the couch wearing a headset playing xbox live
into the headset you are dead analdestroyer
carl pulls the xbox cord out of the law
youve slept on my couch for four weeks
youre a grown man
now sack up and get the hell out of here
will you let me stay here please
are you deaf
you have to say yes if i ask you
i may not seem like i get it but i get everything
lucy and kath
made out one time in the bathroom at rudys
get the hell out of here
carls in front of his computer
there are a bunch of emails selling viagra
he angrily deletes them all
he gets a letter from the king of nigeria
dear carl it is vitally important you send me your bank account information
the government will be closing in on my account in the very near future
your good friend omar former king of nigeria
carl starts typing fast
as carl writes the following email we cuts of him throwing away the boxes of stuff he bought over the internet and giving away the six kittens he got to
omar lets cut the crap
you are not a king
youre probably just a teenage con artist jerking off somewhere in russia
write me again and i will find you and beat your stupid lying face in
sincerely carl kendall
carl angrily flips off his computer
close on the alarm
his alarm goes off
carl hits it off
its now daytime
carl gets dressed
he puts on his suit and tie
his apartment is noticeably nicer than the last time we saw it
carl drives down the street in a fancy car
he pulls into dunkin donuts
he gets out of the car and passes a guy handing out fliers
you want to pawn no
carl walks into dunkin donuts
the dunkin donuts cashier hands carl his coffee
would you like an no
carl hands the cashier the money
carl sits in his office
lucy walks in
whatre you doing all the way over here
its been hard to reach you
ive been a little swamped
things are great
i was wondering when you want to meet with the florist
sorry but im too busy these days
dont have time to help with the party anymore
youre just stopping just like that
im not the one marrying you
maybe you should ask him for some help
he is helping
here i was thinking we were actual friends
lucy leaves upset
carl doesnt move
carl chris and the other vps sit around the conference table
with great importance what is the best way for us to enter the teenage credit card market
give away a free ipod
include one with cans of mountain dew code red
have you guys thought that teenagers dont have the financial knowhow to use a credit card
thats why theyre such a ripe market
any ideas on how to pick that low hanging fruit
include a mastercard with every xbox
i like that
i like that a lot
chris slaps five with carl
chris parker contd now remember tomorrows our official merger ceremony with kbi
so wear your nice suits
im talking to you feldman
all the vps laugh
carl fake laughs along with them
carl gets home
he hits play on his answering machine
over the answering hey carl
long time no see
sorry to hear you wont be planning our engagement party
although i guess that makes you less gay than i thought you were
well be watching the game at rudys tonight if youre interested
carl deletes the message
he flips on survivor and starts to absentmindedly sort through his mail
he throws away junkmail until he gets to a postcard that catches his eye
he reads the postcard
i know this is kind of random but i thought i should write you
we met at that party at normans apartment
i was the ins guy who hated his life and hated you
i just wanted to tell you that i took your advice
i quit my job and have founded a home in botswana for elderly orangutans
ive never been happier
you told me to say yes and it has turned out to be incredible
yours truly jason newmark carl turns over the post card
on the cover of the card is a picture an orangutan
carls alarm goes off
he opens his eyes
hes propped the post card up next to his alarm clock
the orangutan seems to be staring into his soul
carls writing a list of names
the post card lies on the desk nearby
his secretary pops her head in
the executives are gathering in the conference room to officially greet the kbi officials
carls secretary contd re the post card cute gorilla
its an elderly orangutan actually
handing her the list could you please call everyone on this list and tell them to show up at rudys bar grille this evening at pm
carl starts to head out and then turns around
i just want to say it was really great having you as my first secretary
youre not firing me are you
i dont think im going to be working here much longer
carl walks into the crowded room
korean executives and southwest bank executives mingle
carl heads towards chris
i need to talk to you
and i need to talk to you
you mind doing a little ceremonial translating
i dont know if im good enough at korean believe in yourself and the world believes in you
seung sees carl and bows to him
carl bows back
the pretty korean banker sees carl and coquettishly waves to him
chris taps the microphone
the crowd sits down
chris parker contd id like to welcome our new partners into the southwest family
chris nods to carl
in korean with welcome
you will be my partner
in korean thank you
kbi is the at the forefront of the financial world
with your help southwest will be as well
carl takes a beat
chris looks at him expectantly
in korean with he says that you are a son of a dog and like to have the dirty sex
in korean what
we look forward to working together and extending our reach across the globe
in korean with he says in korea you poop on the ground and that here you cannot poop on the ground
in korean that is factually inaccurate in korean i know
but its what the bigot believes
so with this hand shake i make official the acquisition of southwest by korean bank international
chris holds out his hand
in korean although you have poop on your hand i am willing to shake it so i can steal all your money you stupid korean
perfect english with a british accent we have a traitor in our midst
this man just called me a son of a dog and informed me that my hand is covered in fecal matter
he is clearly trying to sabotage the merger
you speak english
you think an international bank financier wouldnt speak fluent english
for whom do you work traitor
keep it secret
unfortunately i cannot approve a merger with a company so incompetent as to have a business saboteur this high up
seung kim walks out followed by all his employees
before chris can say anything

over the loudspeakers announcing the pending marriage of peter carlton and lucy giuliano
carl rides into the bar on a white stallion as white balloons fall from the rafters
