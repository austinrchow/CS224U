banks i dont think we need bother the police dear
the facts of the matter mr
banks kindly do not attempt to cloud the issue with facts
one fact and one fact alone is crystal clear
katie nannas faltered at her post
shes let the family down

shes left us hasnt she
banks yes dear only just
banks what uh yes
george banks here
cherry tree lane
its a matter of some urgency
i should like you to send a policeman around immediately
banks the policemans here george
oh how very prompt
what wonderful service
thank you so much
come in constable
constable thank you sir
while going about my duties on the other side of the park i noted some valuables that had gone astray
i believe theyre yours sir
constable come along now
banks winifred please dont be emotional
constable oh i wouldnt be too hard on em sir
theyve had a long weary walk today
banks children come here at once
jane im sorry we lost katie nanna father
you see it was windy
and the kite was too strong for us
constable in a manner of speaking sir it was the kite that ran away not the children
banks thank you constable
i think i can manage this
jane actually it wasnt a very good kite
we made it ourselves
perhaps if you helped us to make one constable ah thats the ticket sir
kites are skittish things
why only last week with me own youngsters mr
banks im very grateful to you constable for returning the children
and im sure that if you go to the kitchen cookll find you a plate of something
constable thank you sir
i shall now return to my duties
jane thank you constable
constable good night miss
good night maam
good night sir
cookll find me something
i never mrs
banks im awfully sorry about this george
ill expect youll want to discuss it
banks i would indeed
ellen take jane and michael upstairs straightaway
ellen yes sir
i knew it
when alls said and done who bears the brunt of everything around here
me thats who
they dont want an honest hard workin girl around here
they need a ruddy zookeeper
banks im sorry dear but when i chose katie nanna i thought she would be firm with the children
she looked so solemn and cross
banks winifred never confuse efficiency with a liver complaint
banks ill try to do better next time
banks next time
my dear youve engaged six nannies in the last four months
and theyve all been unqualified disasters
banks i quite agree
banks choosing a nanny for the children is an important and delicate task
it requires insight balanced judgment and an ability to read character
under the circumstances i think it might be apropos to take it upon myself to uh select the next person
banks oh would you george
banks obviously the way to find a proper nanny is to go about it in a proper fashion
i shall put an advertisement in the times
take this down please
banks yes of course dear
nanny firm respectable no nonsense
a british nanny must be a general the future empire lies within her hands and so the person that we need to mold the breed is a nanny who can
give commands you getting this winifred
banks oh yes dear
a british bank is run with precision a british home requires nothing less tradition discipline and rules must be the tools without them disorder catastrophe anarchy in short you have
a ghastly mess mrs
banks splendid george
the times will be so pleased
jane weve discussed everything and were very sorry about what we did today
banks i should certainly think so
jane it was wrong to run away from katie nanna
banks it was indeed
jane and we do so want to get on with the new nanny
banks very sensible
i shall be glad to have your help in the matter
jane we thought you would
thats why we wrote this advertisement
banks advertisement for what
jane for the new nanny
banks you wrote an advert mrs
banks george i think we should listen
jane you said you wanted our help
banks but i oh very well
jane wanted a nanny for two adorable children
well thats debatable i must say
jane if you want this choice position have a cheery disposition mr
banks jane i dont jane rosy cheeks no warts michael thats the part i put in
jane play games all sorts you must be kind you must be witty very sweet and fairly pretty mr
banks well of all the ridic mrs
banks george please
jane take us on outings give us treats sing songs bring sweets never be cross or cruel never give us castor oil or gruel love us as a son and
daughter and never smell of barley water michael i put that in too
jane if you wont scold and dominate us we will never you give you cause to hate us we wont hide your spectacles so you cant see put toads in
your bed or pepper in your tea hurry nanny many thanks sincerely jane michael jane and michael banks mr
banks thank you
and now i think weve had quite enough of this nonsense
please return to the nursery
banks they were only trying to help
theyre just children
banks im well aware theyre just children winifred
i only congratulate myself that i decided to step in and take a hand
play games sing songs give treats
theres no question in my mind whatsoever
now is the time for action

i said you are the father of jane and michael banks
banks well well ye yes of course i mean
uh you brought your references i presume

mary poppins oh i make it a point never to give references
a very old fashioned idea to my mind
banks is that so
well have to see about that then wont we
mary poppins now then the qualifications
item one a cheery disposition
i am never cross
item two rosy cheeks
item three play games all sorts
well im sure the children will find my games extremely diverting
banks may i

i thought i tore it up
mary poppins excuse me
item four you must be kind

have you lost something
that paper you see
i thought that i mary poppins you are george banks are you not
mary poppins and you did advertise for a nanny did you not
banks george banks
mary poppins very well then
banks i tore it up turned it over
tore it up again and threw it in there
mary poppins i beg your pardon

mary poppins now about my wages
the reference here is very obscure
banks very obscure
mary poppins we must be very clear on that point mustnt we
banks yes we must indeed
mary poppins i shall require every second tuesday off
banks every tuesday
mary poppins on second thoughts i believe a trial period would be wise
ill give you one week
ill know by then
ill see the children now
close your mouth please michael
we are not a codfish
well dont stand there staring
best foot forward
george what on earth are you doing
i thought you were interviewing nannies

banks you mean youve selected one already
banks yes its done
its its all done
banks well where is she
well eh shes in the nursery of course i mean
i put her to work straightaway i mean
banks how clever of you
i would have muddled the whole thing
tell me is she everything that wed hoped she be
banks well i it all happened rather quickly
i mean i i uh mrs
banks will she be firm
will she give commands
will she mold our young breed
banks you know winifred i think she will
i think she will
banks in that case perhaps youd better tell ellen to dismiss the others
banks the others
ellen y yes sir
banks tell the other applicants they may go
the position has been filled
ellen the others sir
banks yes the others
how many n nannies does she think we need in this house
ellen the position has been filled
jane im afraid the nursery isnt very tidy
mary poppins it is rather like a bear pit isnt it
michael thats a funny sort of bag
mary poppins carpet
michael you mean to carry carpets in
mary poppins no
jane this is your room and theres a lovely view of the park
mary poppins hmm
well its not exactly buckingham palace
still its clean
yes i think it will be quite suitable
just needs a touch here and there
well first things first
i always say the place to hang a hat is on a hat stand
this will never do
i much prefer seeing all of my face at the same time
michael there but there was nothing in it
mary poppins never judge things by their appearance
im sure i never do
a thing of beauty is a joy forever
mmm a little more light perhaps
michael we better keep an eye on this one
jane shes wonderful
mary poppins much better
now let me see
i always carry it with me
it must be here somewhere
mary poppins my tape measure
michael what do you want it for
mary poppins i want to see how you two measure up

mary poppins see for yourself
michael extremely stubborn and sus mary poppins suspicious
now you jane
rather inclined to giggle
doesnt put things away
michael how bout you
mary poppins very well
hold this for me
as i expected
practically perfect in every way
jane mary poppins
is that your name
mary poppins thank you
ive always liked it
now shall we get on with it
jane get on with what
mary poppins in your advertisement did you not specifically request to play games
jane oh yes
mary poppins very well then
our first game is called well begun is half done
michael i dont like the sound of that
mary poppins otherwise entitled lets tidy up the nursery
michael i told you she was tricky
mary poppins shall we begin
jane it is a game isnt it mary poppins
mary poppins well it depends on your point of view
you see in every job that must be done there is an element of fun
you find the fun and snap
the jobs a game
and every task you undertake becomes a piece of cake a lark a spree its very clear to see that a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down the
medicine go down medicine go down just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down in a most delightful way a robin feathering his nest has very little time to rest while gathering his bits of twine and twig though quite intent in his pursuit he has a merry tune to toot he knows a song will move the job along for a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down the medicine go down medicine go down just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down in a most delightful way the honeybees that fetch the nectar from the flowers to the comb never tire of ever buzzing to and fro because they take a little nip from every flower that they sip and hence reflection and hence mary poppins they find reflection they find mary poppins reflection their task is not a grind mary poppins cheeky
dont be all day about it please
michael let me out
let me out
let me out
mary poppins well that was very thank you now when youve quite finished
that will be quite sufficient

let me look at you
well youre not as well turned out as id like

i am not out of sorts
i am in a perfectly equable mood
i dont require being made to feel better
banks but youre always saying that you wanted a cheerful and pleasant household
banks winifred i should like to make a slight differentiation between the word cheerful and just plain giddy irresponsibility
banks excuse me dear
posts everyone please
banks i have no objection to anyone being cheerful or pleasant
but i do expect a certain decorum
i can tell you one thing winifred
i dont propose standing idly by and letting that woman mary poppins undermine the discipline and theres something odd i may say extremely odd about the behavior of this household
since that woman arrived
and i want you to know that ive noticed it

mary poppins as you wish
banks mary poppins i very much regret what i must say to you
banks good evening george
is anything the matter
banks im afraid there is
banks i id love to stay but i have to dress for my rally in hampstead
banks winifred it is my wish that you be present
banks oh yes george of course
banks mary poppins i must confess i am extremely disappointed in you
ellen shes for it now
ive heard the master do this speech before
banks i dont deny that i am partially responsible for allowing the children to spend their days on worthless frivolity to the exclusion of all else
but it is high time they learned the seriousness of life
banks but george theyre only children
and in the light of what has happened mrs
banks george are you certain you know what youre doing
banks i believe i do winifred
a british bank is run with precision a british home requires nothing less tradition discipline and rules must be the tools without them disorder chaos moral disintegration in short you
have a ghastly mess mary poppins i quite agree
banks the children must be molded shaped and taught that lifes a looming battle to be faced and fought in short i am disturbed to hear my children talking about
popping in and out of chalk pavement pictures consorting with racehorse persons fox hunting
yes well i dont mind that quite so much
at any rate its traditional
but tea parties on the ceiling
i ask you
having tea parties on the ceiling and highly questionable outings of every other kind
if they must go on outings these outings ought to be fraught with purpose yes and practicality these silly words like superca super superca mary poppins supercalifragilistic expialidocious
banks yes well done
you said it
and popping through pictures have little use fulfill no basic need theyve got to learn the honest truth despite their youth they must learn mary poppins about the life you
mary poppins they must feel the thrill of totting up a balanced book a thousand ciphers neatly in a row mr
banks quite right
mary poppins when gazing at a graph that shows the profits up their little cup of joy should overflow mr
mary poppins its time they learned to walk in your footsteps mr
banks my footsteps
mary poppins to tread your straight and narrow path with pride mr
banks with pride
mary poppins tomorrow just as you suggest pressed and dressed jane and michael will be at your side mr
you hit the nail right on the at my side
where are we going
mary poppins to the bank of course exactly as you proposed
banks i proposed
mary poppins of course
now if youll excuse me
tomorrows an important day for the children
i shall see they have a proper nights sleep
banks winifred did i say that i was going to take the children to the bank
banks it certainly sounded that way dear
and why not
a capital idea
just the medicine they need for all this slipshod sugary female thinking they get around here all day long
jane mary poppins we wont let you go
mary poppins go
what on earth are you talking about
michael didnt you get sacked
mary poppins sacked
i am never sacked
jane oh mary poppins

me putting ideas into peoples heads
jane wheres he taking us
mary poppins to the bank
jane oh michael the city
and well see all the sights and father can point them out to us
mary poppins well most things he can
but sometimes a person we love through no fault of his own cant see past the end of his nose
jane past the end of his nose
mary poppins yes
sometimes a little thing can be quite important
michael oh look
jane father passes that every day
he sees that
mary poppins early each day to the steps of st

before the mortar of his zeal has a chance to congeal the cup is dashed from his lips
the flame is snuffed a borning
hes brought to wrack and ruin in his prime
bert life is a rum go guvnor and thats the truth
banks you know what i think
its that woman mary poppins
from the moment she stepped into this house things began to happen to me
bert mary poppins
banks yes yes of course
my world was calm well ordered exemplary
then came this person with chaos in her wake and now my lifes ambitions go with one fell blow its quite a bitter pill to take
its that poppins woman
she did it
bert i know the very person you mean
shes the one what sings
a spoonful of sugar that is all it takes it changes bread and water into tea and cakes mr
banks you see
thats exactly what i mean
changing bread and water into tea and cakes
banks no wonder everythings higgledy piggledy here
bert a spoonful of sugar goes a long long way have yourself a healthy helpin everyday an healthy helpin of trouble if you ask me

youre a man of high position
esteemed by your peers

just what to do mr
banks well i mean look i i dont think i ca bert like you say guvnor
youve got to grind grind grind at that grindstone though childhood slips like sand through a sieve and all too soon theyve up and grown and then theyve flown and
its too late for you to give just that spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down the medicine go down medicine go down well good bye guvnor

do you know what happened
banks yes sir
yes i think i do
uh uh as the ship lay in boston harbor uh a party of the colonists dressed as red indians uh boarded the vessel behaved very rudely and and threw all
the tea overboard
this made the tea unsuitable for drinking even for americans
the loan was defaulted
panic ensued within these walls
there was a run on the bank
dawes snr from that time to this sir there has not been a run on this bank until today
a run sir caused by the disgraceful conduct of your son
do you deny it
banks i do not deny it sir
and i shall be only too glad to assume responsibility for my son
