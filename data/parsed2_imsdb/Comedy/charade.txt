written by peter stone based on a story by peter stone and marc behm october st silence complete silence for the urbanite though the oncoming darkness is punctuated by the
sounds of farm country a few birds a distant rumble of thunder from some heavy clouds on the horizon a dogs barking
camera pans the green squared off flatland lit only by a fine sunset in its final throes
then gradually starting from nothing a rumble is heard quickly growing louder and louder until the sound of a train can be recognized
camera pans quickly discovering the railroad line atop a man made rise of land and the speeding passenger train is upon us flashing by with a roar
then as if from nowhere the figure of a man hits the embankment and rolls crazily down to the bottom into the thick underbrush alongside the tracks
it lies in the bushes still unmoving dead
camera pans away to the quiet peaceful countryside as the sound of the train fades off until there is silence once more
title music begins with a crash
a handsome and elegant hotel perched on the mountain side overlooking the french resort town
a large open sun deck tables gaily colored parasols sun bathers
one of the latter is regina lampert a lovely young girl
she is besides taking in the sun involved in her favorite activity eating
then a dark ominous shape intrudes in the f
focus changes to bring into sharp relief a revolver shining black and ugly in the sunlight
reggie unaware of her danger continues to eat
the finger tightens around the trigger and finally the gun shoots a stream of water arcs with unerring aim straight into reggies face
including jean louis a french boy of six or so
reggie looks at him sternly
in for trouble oh la
dont tell me you didnt know it was loaded
sylvie gaudet french attractive blonde in her early thirties comes from the railing of the sun deck to join reggie and jean louis
isnt there something constructive he can do like start an avalanche
to jean louis va jouer mon ange
jean louis scampers off content to have gotten off so lightly
sylvie notices reggies lunch which consists of cold chicken potato salad rolls and butter wine and coffee
when you start to eat like this something is the matter
no answer from reggie
sylvie begins reading a magazine as reggie continues eating
sylvie im getting a divorce
hes the only husband ive got
i tried to make it work i really have but but what
i dont know how to explain it
im just too miserable
reggie picks up a chicken leg and starts off
sylvie regards the devastated table before following
it is infuriating that your unhappiness does not turn to fat
a magnificent indoor glass enclosed pool the vista of snow covered mountains seen through the ceiling high windows beyond
reggie and sylvie are passing through their conversation continuing
but why do you want a divorce
because i dont love him
but that is no reason to get a divorce
an open balcony running around two sides of the pool sun worshippers lying in deck chairs
reggie and sylvie appear their conversation continuing
with a rich husband and this years clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends
sitting i admit i moved to paris because i was tired of american provincial but that doesnt mean im ready for french traditional
i loathe the idea of divorce sylvie but if only charles had been honest with me thats all i ask of anybody the simple truth
but with him everything is secrecy and lies
hes hiding something something frightening something terrible and evil
she stops as she is aware of a weird figure hovering over her
she wheels terrified
a strange grotesque knitted mask that completely covers the face except for eyes nose and mouth
the eyes inside this particular mask stare down at reggie
does this belong to you
camera pans down to include jean louis his hand held firmly by the man in the mask
including reggie man sylvie and jean louis
reggie is too terrified to answer
realizing this the man peter joshua takes off the snow mask to reveal a handsome tanned face
oh forgive me
indicating jean louis is this yours
indicating sylvie its hers
whered you find him robbing a bank
he was throwing snowballs at baron rothschild
a pause we dont know each other do we
why do you think were going to
i dont know how would i know
im afraid i already know a great many people
until one of them dies i couldnt possibly meet anyone else
smiling yes of course
but you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list he starts off quitter
turning hows that
you give up awfully easy dont you
eyeing one then the other sylvie sizes up the situation and rises
viens jean louis let us take a walk
i have never seen a rothschild before
sylvie and jean louis start off but not before the boy squirts peter with his pistol
drying clever fellow almost missed me
im afraid youre blocking my view
which view would you like
the one youre blocking
this is the last chance i have im flying back to paris this afternoon
whats your name
im regina lampert
is there a mr
good for you
no it isnt
im getting a divorce
please not on my account
no you see i dont really love him
well youre honest anyway
yes i am im compulsive about it dishonesty infuriates me
like when you go into a drugstore
im not sure i well you go in and you ask for some toothpaste the small size and the man brings you the large size
you tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size
i always thought the large size was the largest size but he says that the family size the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large
size that the large size is the smallest size there is
is there a mrs
yes but were divorced
that wasnt a proposal i was just curious
is your husband with you
oh charles is hardly ever with me
first it was separate rooms now were trying it with cities
what do people call you pete
turning to go well ive enjoyed talking with you
now youre angry
no im not ive got some packing to do
im also going back to paris today
well wasnt it shakespeare who said when strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again
shakespeare never said that
how do you know
its terrible you just made it up
well the ideas right anyway
are you going to call me
are you in the book
is there only one charles lampert
her face clouding
lord i hope so
the arc de triomphe at the far end of the avenue
camera pans to pick up a taxi as it pulls up before the handsome building
inside are reggie sylvie and jean louis
as reggie climbs out and the driver begins unloading her suitcases
goodbye sylvie and thanks
she turns toward the house jean louis sticks his head out of the taxi window
when you get your divorce will you be going back to america
reggie looks at sylvie surprised
he knows everything
to jean louis dont you want me to stay
yes of course but if you went back and wrote me a letter you could have the stamps
ill get you some here okay
reggie walks toward the house with the driver who carries her cases
she presses the button that electrically opens the front door
as the elevator rises reggie gets out followed by the driver
he puts down the bags in front of the apartment door
handing him a tip merci
the driver leaves
she goes to the door and presses the minuterie the button that turns on the time light and the lights come on
then she rings the doorbell
there is no answer
she rings again
sighing she digs out her keys and starts to fit it into the lock
at this moment the minuterie expires plunging the scene into darkness
she finds the button and the light goes on again
she inserts the key and turns it
close shot door as it opens and reggie steps into the she stops her expression changing
from reggies p
as camera pans the entrance hall
it is bare no furniture no rug no pictures no nothing
she stares for a moment then goes back out into the landing
as reggie steps back outside
she looks at the nameplate beside the door
it reads mr
reggie looks at the plate in disbelief then turns and hurries back into the apartment
as reggie hurries into the entrance hall
now camera following she goes into the salon
it is also empty stripped bare
there are squares of the walls original color where paintings used to hang the hooks still in the wall
she rushes now going into the bedroom camera following crazily lurching and careening behind her
the bedroom too is empty
she goes to the built in wardrobe closets and throws open all the doors
only some hangers remain
she pulls open the drawers nothing
she turns and running now goes through another door to the library camera following
the rows of shelves are as empty as the rest of the apartment
she begins to turn in a circle looking for something anything
in a panic she turns and runs out colliding suddenly with a man whom she and we have not noticed until the moment of impact
a heavy set man of no particular age with tobacco colored hair and thick glasses
madame charles lampert
including reggie in a state of near shock
i am inspector edouard grandpierre of the police judiciaire
would you be so kind as to come with me please
we see a large metal drawer being opened and an all too familiar shape outlined under a damp sheet of muslin
looking straight down at the tops of reggies grandpierres and an attendants head and smack into the open drawer
grandpierre lifts a corner of the sheet at the bottom and reveals a bare foot with a ticket tied to its big toe
he stoops to read it
satisfied he recovers the foot then moves to the other end to uncover the head
as the sheet starts to lift reggie as she looks down into the camera
she closes her eyes for a moment then looks again
you are positive
she nods again
grandpierre moves into the shot
you loved him
im very cold
grandpierre nods as he turns to the unseen attendant
camera suddenly moves as the drawer is slid back into the wall
blackness comes with a loud clang and continues while the echo dies
close shot desk drawer from above as it is pulled open
a photograph of charles lampert lies face up in the drawer
a hand reaches in and pulls it out
including grandpierre sitting behind his desk and reggie sitting across from him
the office is as bare as most policemens offices
grandpierre studies the photo
we discovered your husbands body lying next to the tracks of the paris bourdeaux railroad line
he was dressed only in his pajamas
do you know of any reason why he might have wished to leave france
your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the maranguape
it sailed from bordeaux for maracaibo this morning at seven
a pause im very confused
she starts to rummage through her bag
grandpierre shoves a package of french cigarettes across the desk to her
but she pulls a package of nuts out of her bag
she begins separating the shells with her thumb nail and eating the nuts depositing the shells in the ashtray
grandpierre watches this for an instant
he was american
he didnt have one
he was a wealthy man
i dont know
i suppose so
about how wealthy would you say
i dont know
where did he keep his money
i dont know
besides yourself who is his nearest relation
i dont know
exploding cest absurde madame
to tale ment absurde
pause im sorry
it is all right
grandpierre sighs puts down his pencil and pushes a button on the desk
he removes a cigar from his desk and inserts it into his mouth
is it all right
i wish you wouldnt
he rips the cigar out of his mouth and slams it back into the drawer closing it fiercely
a uniformed policeman sticks his head in the door
les effets de lampert
the policeman leaves and closes the door
on wednesday last your husband sold the entire contents of the apartment at public auction
furniture clothing kitchenware everything
the gallery in complying with his wishes paid him in cash
one million two hundred and fifty thousand new francs
in dollars a quarter of a million
the authorities in bordeaux have searched his compartment on the train
they have searched it thoroughly
they did not find madame
he opens the desk drawer puts the cigar back in his mouth and lights a match by scratching it against the glass desk top before he remembers reggies request
he puts it back in the drawer again
the door opens and the policeman enters again this time carrying a wicker basket which he deposits on grandpierres desk and leaves
grandpierre peers into the basket
these few things are all that was found in the train compartment
there was no other baggage
your husband must have been in a great hurry
he begins to take them out placing them on the desk identifying each item as he does
one wallet containing four thousand francs one agenda pausing he opens the notebook his last notation was made yesterday thursday reading five p
jardin des champs elysees looking up why there
i dont know
perhaps he met somebody
returning to the items in the basket one ticket of passage to south america one letter stamped but unsealed addressed to you lighting up a letter
may i see it
grandpierre hands her the letter and watches her closely as she reads it
reading my dear regina i hope you are enjoying your holiday
megeve can be so lovely this time of year
the days pass very slowly and i hope to see you soon
as always charles
your dentist called yesterday
your appointment has been changed
she looks up puzzled not very much is it
we took the liberty of calling your dentist we thought perhaps we would learn something
your appointment has been changed
he smiles at his little joke then returns to the basket one key to your apartment one comb one fountain pen one toothbrush one tin of tooth powder he looks
up that is all
he slides a sheet of paper and pen across to her then starts to put the things back into the basket while he speaks if you will sign this list
you may take the things with you
sighing is that all
can i go now
one more question
is this your husbands passport
he reaches into the desk drawer and pulls out a passport which he hands to her
the cover indicates that it is swiss
reggies hand opens it to a picture of a man the man we saw in grandpierres photo
under it is the name charles lampert
of course it is
he hands her another passport
the cover is american
when it is opened we see the identical picture but the name under it reads charles voss
i dont understand
he hands her one at a time two more passports
one is italian which when opened shows the same photo with the name carlo fabri
the other is venezuelan the same photo and the name carlos moreno
have you nothing to say madame
reggie looks down at the four passports then back to hopefully its all right if you want to smoke your cigar now
the house is empty as before
now it is silent the late afternoon light coming from outside
reggie stands by a window
a canvas airline bag rests on the floor nearby
suddenly there is the noise of a door opening
as her head turns in alarm toward the noise
there is a moment of silence then footsteps are heard coming closer
as peter enters
surprised what are you doing here
i phoned but nobody answered
i wanted to tell you how sorry i am and to find out if there was anything i could do
how did you find out
its in all the afternoon papers
im very sorry
i rang the bell but i dont think its working
yes it is i heard it this morning
he looks around for the light switch then goes to it and flicks it on nothing happens
he flicks it a few more times
they must have turned off the electricity
she shakes her head
peter looks around
where did everything go
charles sold it all at auction
do you know what youre going to do
try and get my old job back at unesco i suppose
im a simultaneous translator like sylvie only shes english to french im french to english
thats what i did before i married charles
the police probably think i killed him
instant divorce you mean
something like that
but im sorry it ended like this tossed off a train like a sack of third class mail
taking her hand come on
you cant stay here
i dont know where to go
well find you a hotel
not too expensive im not a lady of leisure anymore
something modest but clean and near enough to unesco so you can take a cab when it rains okay
he picks up the airlines bag and they start out
reggie stops at the door and looks back
i loved this room but charles never saw it only what was in it
all those exquisite things looking around i think i prefer it like this
close shot of a phonograph
a hand appears starts the record on it spinning then places the arm at the beginning
an instant later organ music starts with a roar
close shot of the coffin
it rests on a low platform with a bouquet or two of flowers near the head the lid open
inside the face made up to look lifelike but failing lie the remnants of charles lampert
the inspector sits quietly eyes downcast staring at his hands in a prayer like attitude
camera pulls back revealing row after row of empty wooden bench like seats in the large dimly lit high ceilinged room
finally in the first row reggie and sylvie are discovered
besides grandpierre they are the only ones present
reggie turns around to look at the empty room
they speak in whispers
its not exactly what id call a large turn out
didnt charles have any friends
dont ask me im only the widow
indicating grandpierre if charles had died in bed we wouldnt even have him
at least he knows how to behave at funerals
his eyes still lowered
camera pans down to feature his hands he is methodically trimming his nails with a small clipper
have you no idea who could have done it
until two days ago all i really knew about charles was his name now it turns out i didnt even know that
the front door of the chapel is heard opening and a shaft of daylight streams in
the women turn
the short heavy set figure of a man is outlined against the bright outdoor light
he stands for a moment then closes the door after him
leopold gideon short sighted bald in his middle forties glances around nervously like a barnyard bird
then he walks down one of the side aisles of the chapel
as he watches gideon
as she watches him
gideon arrives at the coffin
he stops looks down at lamperts body for a moment
then suddenly in rapid succession he sneezes six times
he takes a small bottle from his pocket shakes a pill from it and swallows it dry
he turns and walks back up the aisle looking for a place to sit
he comes face to face with grandpierre stops turns to sit somewhere else
do you know him
ive never seen him before
he must have known charles pretty well
how can you tell
hes allergic to him
sylvie turns and glances at gideon
again the sound of the door opening interrupts them
they turn to look
again the figure of a man is outlined in silhouette against the outside brightness
when he closes the door we can see tex penthollow a slim rangy man with sandy colored hair a weatherbeaten face washed out blue eyes also in his forties
he wears a velvet corduroy suit string tie and a bright yellow flower in his lapel
a bulldurham tag hangs from his outside breast pocket dangling from its string
he starts down the aisle toward the bier camera leading him and we notice his unsteady gait
he turns to look at the others present
moving down the aisle
grandpierres face then gideons then reggies and sylvies all staring at camera
as tex arrives
he stands staring at lamperts body swaying on his feet until he reaches out and grabs the side of the coffin to steady himself
then he takes the flower from his lapel and throws it into the open box
heavy texas accent ariva durchy charlie
as tex turns away from the coffin and approaches reggie and sylvie addressing the latter after having first reached for his hat which he discovers he isnt wearing
miz lampert maam
sylvie points to reggie
unruffled tex starts over
addressing reggie this time
miz lampert maam
charlie had no call to handling it this a way
he sure didnt
i dont understa but tex has nodded his head and moved off to find a seat
when he spots gideon the two men stare at each other
finally tex chooses a seat away from him and sits
it flies open this time with a bang and the large man who appears almost fills the frame
as the loud noise awakens him with a snort mid snore
closing the door we see herman scobie a heavy weight tall and wide but not fat with black hair combed straight back and heavy bushy eyebrows of a matching color
which meet over his nose and join up
about the same age as the first two men scobie is dressed in a battered raincoat his hands thrust deep in the pockets
he marches down the aisle
looking straight ahead camera panning with him
he stops before the coffin and stares into it
as he stares down into the coffin his tongue trying to dislodge a bit of food caught in his teeth
he stares hard at the body squinting his eyes
then he removes one hand from his pocket removes a pin from the inside of his lapel picks his teeth with it then slowly lets the hand down into the
the pin held between thumb and forefinger he jabs it slowly but positively deep into the back of one of the dead mans hands
there is no reaction
he watches the dead man carefully still squinting
then finally satisfied he returns the pin to his lapel and walks back up the aisle and out of the door slamming it after him
having watched scobie exit
suddenly a hand falls on her shoulder
she jumps in alarm and utters a little cry of fright
featuring a funeral attendant a cadaverous type arent they all with a black cut away coat and an over solicitous unctuous manner
he is eternally bent at the waist in a sort of half bow
he offers reggie a letter which she takes
pas du tout madame pardon pardon pardon
he backs off and is gone
reggie looks at the letter back and front then starts to open it
who is it from
the american embassy
she pulls out the letter and starts to read it
it bears the great seal as a letterhead and the typed message reads dear mrs
lampert please drop by my office tomorrow at noon thirty
i am anxious to discuss the matter of your late husbands death
sincerely signed h
sylvie has been reading over reggies shoulder
what is it about
i dont know
but if this is a sample of american diplomacy im buying a fallout shelter
the fine old building in the rue gabriel
as reggie leaves the elevator two young diplomatic types step in immersed in conversation
i bluffed the old man out of the last pot with a pair of deuces
whats so depressing about that
if i can do it what are the russians doing to him
the elevator door closes on them
reggie reacts to this and starts down the hall finally stopping at the door
it is marked a h
reggie checks the letter then opens the door
the office is empty the typewriter on the secretarys desk is covered with its plastic shroud
reggie enters looks for somebody notices that the door to the private office is slightly ajar
there is no answer hello
from the private office is there anything wrong miss tompkins
uh miss tompkins isnt here
bartholomew comes to the door and looks in
he is a pale grey haired man who looks on first examination older than his forty odd years
sickly would be the word that describes him best pallid consumptive looking
he wears heavy tortoise framed glasses which fall down his nose and cause him to push them back in place every so often with a quick automatic motion
im sorry my secretary must have gone to lunch
looking at his watch come in mrs
youre quite late
he motions for her to enter standing aside to let her do so
a small cubicle there is a silver framed photo of three kids on the desk
bartholomew indicates a chair then goes behind his desk and sits
a can of lighter fluid stands open on the desk and a crumpled hankie beside it
excuse me for a moment mrs
lampert its a stubborn little devil
he works at a stain on his necktie with lighter fluid and hankie
dry cleaningwise things are all fouled up
i had a good man an excellent man on the rue ponthieu but h
asked us to use the plant here in the building to ease the gold outflow
bartholomew are you sure you know who i am
looking up charles lamperts widow yes
going back to the tie last time i sent out a tie only the spot came back
he looks up at her laughs silently then goes back to his tie
as they say
he puts away the lighter fluid in a desk drawer smells the hankie passes on it then sticks it in his pocket
he opens another drawer and pulls out various sandwiches wrapped in waxpaper a salt and pepper shaker a tube of mustard a bottle of red wine and two dixie cups
have some please
checking liverwurst liverwurst chicken and liverwurst
he uncorks the wine fills a cup and begins eating
do you know what c
i dont suppose its an airline is it
central intelligence agency c
you mean spies and things like that
only we call them agents
you mean youre
someone has to do it mrs
lampert im sorry its just that i didnt think that you people were supposed to admit im not an agent mrs
lampert im an administrator a desk jockey trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under allocated funds
congress seems to think that all a spy needs agent
yes that all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and hes in business
whats all this got to do with me mr
his mouth full your husband was wanted by the u
may i have a sandwich please
he hands her a sandwich and fills a wine cup for her
to be more specific he was wanted by this agency
eating so that was it
we knew him of course by his real name
almost choking his real
voss charles voss

voss taking a photo from his desk id like you to look at this photograph please by the way you saw this one didnt you
indicating the kids on the desk scott cathy and ham jr
now look at this one mrs
voss and stop calling me that
lamperts the name on the marriage license
yes and tell me if you recognize anyone
just a moment

he reaches back into the drawer and pulls out a glass which he gives her
four men all in army uniform sitting behind a table
the glass is held over the first magnifying the face
its a photo of a young charles lampert
he looks so young when was this taken
the next face please
the glass and camera move to the next man a young tex
its the man who came to the funeral yesterday im sure of it a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie
does the name tex penthollow mean anything to you
the glass and camera move to the third face a young gideon
yes and he was there too a little fatter now and less hair but its the same one
do you know him mrs
the last one please
the glass and camera move to the fourth face a young thats a face you dont forget he was there too herman scobie

no thank heaven
a pause regarding her mrs
lampert im afraid youre in a great deal of danger
why should i be in any danger
youre charles vosss wife now that hes dead youre their only lead
bartholomew if youre trying to frighten me youre doing a really first rate job
she takes another sandwich please do what we ask mrs
lampert its your only chance

those three men want it too they want it very badly
but its charless money not theirs
laughing oh mrs
id love to see you try and convince them of that
drying his eyes oh dear
then whose is it
his or theirs
she looks at him for a moment oh i see
and im afraid we want it back
but i dont have it
youre the only one who could have it
im sorry its impossible
its the truth
bartholomew is silent for a moment thinking
i believe you
thanks very much
oh youve got the money all right you just dont know youve got it
bartholomew if i had a quarter of a million dollars believe me id know it
nevertheless mrs lampert youve got it
you mean its just lying around someplace all that cash
or a safe deposit key a certified check a baggage claim you look for it mrs
lampert im quite sure youll find it
but look for it mrs
lampert look just as hard and as fast as you can
you may not have a great deal of time
those men know you have it just as surely as we do
you wont be safe until the moneys in our hands
is that clear
he writes something on a pad of paper and tears it off handing it to her
heres where youre to call me day or night
its a direct line to both my office and my apartment
dont lose it mrs
lampert and please dont tell anyone about coming to see me
it could prove fatal for them as well as yourself
wait a minute you think those three men killed charles dont you
weve no proof of course but we rather think so yes
well there you are
charles had the money with him so whoever killed him has it they have it
bartholomew shakes his head
grimly because theyre still here
like i said mrs lampert im afraid youre in a great deal of danger
remember what happened to charles
reggie takes the last sandwich and begins eating furiously
one of the french punch and judy shows set up on certain days in the small park alongside the broad avenue between the rond point and the place de la
at the moment judy as always is beating punch with a bat
the sound of children laughing and screaming can be heard
sitting on small benches lined up to face the stage
their attention is fixed on the show their belief totally suspended by the play as only childrens can be laughing at the slapstick booing the villain frightened by the perils
sitting on the last bench next to some children
they are laughing but she isnt she just watches her attention caught up but her face void of emotion
the bench is too low for her forcing her knees up almost under her chin
after a moment peter comes up behind her and stepping over the benches sits beside her
she doesnt seem to notice
throughout the following scene the children and the actors can be heard in the b
she turns and looks at him for a moment
vaguely hallo peter
you telephoned me to meet you
ive been standing on the corner back there waiting for you
im sorry i heard the children laughing
a roar from the children
reggie and peter turn toward the stage
punch and judy are arguing loudly
whats going on
dont you understand french
im still having trouble with english
the man and the woman are married punch and judy are batting each other on the head
yes i can see that theyre batting each other over the head with clubs
finally judy knocks punch out of sight and a puppet wearing a three cornered hat appears
whos that with the hat
wearing a hat he stands off in the background watching
thats the policeman he wants to arrest judy for killing punch
judy and the policeman are batting one another
whats she saying now
that shes innocent she didnt do it
she did it all right take it from me
i believe her
punchs head appears on the other side of the stage says something then ducks out
who was that
punch of course
i thought he was dead
hes only pretending to teach her a lesson only her face clouding only he is dead peter i saw him hes not pretending
somebody threw him off a train
what am i going to do
charles was mixed up in something terrible
i wish youd let me help you
whatever it is it doesnt sound like the sort of thing that a woman can handle all by herself
judy has gotten the upper hand is now batting the policemans brains out
close shot grandpierre as he winces
have you got a mirror
she nods give it to me
she hands it to him and he holds it in front of her face
right there between your eyes see
youre much too young and too pretty to have anything like that
how about making me vice president in charge of cheering you up
jumping at the suggesting starting tonight
he stands on the dance floor in front of a five piece latin dance band a spotlight on him wearing his professional smile as he speaks into a mike
bonsoir mesdames et messieurs good evening ladies and gentlemen guten abend meine damen und herren ce soir comme tous les soirs lattraction ici au black sheep club cest vous
venez mesdames et messieurs step right up ladies and gentlemen kommen sie her meine damen en herren avanti signore e signori avanti
at their table
reggie is dressed in a lovely givenchy dress
what was all that
fun and games
evidently were the floorshow
you mean you and me
come on avanti avanti
she rises and pulls him along
including the dance floor as most of the patrons go to it laughing self consciously and looking around
ecoutez bien les regles sont tres simples the rules are very easy deux equipes two teams each with one orange une orange eine apfelsine un arrancia held under the chin
like so does it comme ca and passed to the player behind you sans vous servir de vos mains using nothing but the chin no hands and keeping the orange at all costs from touching the floor
commencez mesdames et messieurs begin ladies and gentlemen signore e signori comminciate
the emcee now circulates forming teams telling the patrons to line up making sure there is a woman next to every man
reggie and peter are the second couple in their line
then the emcee picks up a basket of oranges and places one under the chin held securely against the chest of each man at the head of the line
blowing a whistle a signal for the game to begin and the band to play the men turn to the women behind them and attempt to transfer the oranges from
under their chins to under the chins of the women without using their hands
this maneuver can only be accomplished by embracing ones partner passionately and firmly pressing the orange against the partners throat until he or she can grip it tightly enough with
the chin to turn and offer it to the person next in line where the process begins anew
however the slightest miscalculation which can be brought about by any number of human frailties haste modesty inhibition or lack of co ordination will surely result in losing control of
the orange so that it either falls to the floor where it can only be picked up by the chin or it starts to roll and slide from its proper place to some other less proper spot on the human anatomy forcing the man or the woman to retrieve it again with the chin only
this latter is an activity which can prove extremely satisfying to old friends or even new friends who wish to become old friends but can only be a torment for
total strangers and or the english
some of the couples in various states of confusion entanglement and intimacy all of them naturally hilarious
it is his turn to take the orange from a very short but quite shapely young girl in a strapless dress held up by an abundance of cantilever
peter takes when he sees the twin obstacles which might and probably will encumber the game but increase his worldly experience
the contest begins because of her stature he is forced to move in low making the ordinary embrace needed for success difficult if not impossible
then inexorably the orange starts to slip down the girls front
manfully he goes after it
she is enjoying it thoroughly
bending over backwards in a sort of frontal half nelson peter makes a last valiant effort and voila grips the orange under his chin amid much cheering and congratulations from
members of his team
now he turns to reggie and they face one another for a moment
lay on macduff
they go at it working their bodies together to make it all possible
then for a moment the game and the onlookers seem less important than their proximity
but alas they are too good despite themselves and the transfer is accomplished again with appreciative cheers from the team
reggie with the orange now tucked firmly under her chin turns to the next team member in line and is locked in an embrace before she realizes her partner is
leopold gideon the short fat balding man seen at the funeral and later in bartholomews photo
reggie starts to draw back but gideon holds her tightly
putting his chin around the orange he is able to speak quietly in reggies ear
her eyes show her fright as he whispers mrs
lampert what do you want
didnt charles tell you mrs
tell me what
it doesnt belong to you mrs
lampert you do know that dont you
i dont know anything
lampert any morning now you could wake up dead
leave me alone
lampert like last weeks news like charles mrs
lampert stop it
as reggie hauls off and kicks gideon full in the shin
he stiffens as the pain registers
instead of shouting he merely closes his eyes
including reggie and gideon and peter standing by as well as some spectators
peter comes quickly forward
reggie whats the trouble
reggie realizes that gideon no longer offers any resistance
she steps back leaving gideon holding the orange foolishly under his chin his eyes still closed
reggie stares at him for a moment
he he was stepping on my foot
slowly his eyes open and tears stream from them rolling down his cheeks
he speaks while holding the orange
forgive me it was quite unintentional im sure
gideon turns to the woman behind him and the game resumes
starting off wait for me i wont be long
she goes off toward the rear of the club and starts down a flight of stairs
watching her go a concerned look on his face
a small dimly lit area with a door to the combination mens womens room and a phone cabin with a solid door
the music and shouting from upstairs float down
reggie comes down the stairs and goes to the phone flicking on the light and closing the door after her
reggie takes a jeton phone token from her bag and drops it in the slot
then she takes out a slip of paper the one given her by bartholomew and dials the number written on it
she listens to it ring then evidently he answers
into phone mr
bartholomew its me reggie lampert listen mr
bartholomew ive seen one of the she stops mr
can you hear me
she realizes she has not pushed the button which takes her coin and allows the party at the other end to hear her voice
bartholomew its me regina lam
suddenly the door of the booth opens and reggie wheels to look slamming the receiver down as she does
tex penthollow the second man from the funeral and photo the man in the corduroy suit and string tie stands in the doorway his face calm a hand rolled but
unlit cigarette in his mouth
he has put one foot up against the side of the door so she cant leave
reggie stares at him terrified
howdy miz lampert
wha what do you want
tex takes a book of matches from his pocket
you know what i want miz lampert
no no im dont
come on now sure you do
an youd better give it to me miz lampert cuz i aint foolin
he strikes a match and lights his cigarette holding the burning match in his hand afterward
i dont know what tex without a word throws the still lit match into the booth onto reggies lap
she beats it out frantically
what are you doing
tex lights another match and throws it into her lap
she beats this one out too
dont make too much noise miz lampert he lights another match and reaches out toward her hair with it
she shrinks back
it could get a whole lot worse
then he throws it into her lap
as he continues to speak he punctuates each phrase or so with another lit match
reggie is too busy beating them out to do anything else
it belongs to me miz lampert an if you dont give it to me your life aint gonna be worth the paper its printed on
you savvy what im sayin miz lampert
please stop please
you think on it real careful like miz lampert yhear
as she frantically beats out the matches her eyes on her work
youre insane absolutely insane
she looks up then blinks her eyes
there is no one there
reggie rises and steps out of the booth
as reggie looks around
there is no one there
as reggie returns sits and starts to put another jeton into the slot
she notices her hand is shaking
she reaches back into her bag removes a piece of candy puts it into her mouth and leans her head back against the wall closing her eyes
suddenly the door opens and reggie shrieks but this time it is peter
what are you doing in here
a sigh of relief having a nervous breakdown
reggie and peter enter the deserted lobby
you havent said a word since we left the club what happened back there
i im not sure if im supposed to tell you or not
i dont think i follow you
he said if i told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me
thats what im not supposed to say
stop this nonsense
if youre in some sort of trouble i want to know about it
stop bullying me
everybodys bullying me
i wasnt yes you were you called it nonsense
being murdered in cold blood isnt nonsense
wait until it happens to you sometime
she goes to the desk followed by peter where the night clerk greets them sleepily
quarante deux sil vous plait
the night clerk gets the key off a hook and hands it to bonne nuit
to peter would you mind seeing me to the door
of course not
they go to the elevator where he opens the door for her
as reggie and peter enter the small cage
it is somewhat cramped forcing them to stand close together
this is quite a place for making friends isnt it
he presses the button and the elevator starts to rise
you said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something
busy examining the cleft in his chin how do you shave in there
what was it
what was what
what your husband was mixed up in
look i know its asking you to stretch your imagination but cant you pretend for a moment that im a woman and that youre a dont you know i could
already be arrested for transporting a minor above the first floor
the elevator stops
on the street where you live
how about once more around the park
he reaches across her and opens the door
as reggie leaves the elevator followed by peter
they walk to her door
there is a moment of silence as she looks at him
imitating peter him do you mind if i come in for a nightcap reggie
her well it is awfully late
him just one all right
her promise youll behave yourself
him sorry baby i never make promises i cant keep
how would you like a spanking
how would you like a punch in the nose
stop treating me like a child
then stop acting like one
if youre really in some kind of trouble id like to hear about it
otherwise its late im tired and im going home to bed
do you know whats wrong with you
he turns and leaves
she smiles slightly then turns and puts the key into the door and opens it
featuring the door
reggie enters then stops abruptly the doorknob still in her hand
the room has been torn apart
and standing in the center is herman scobie the large man in the battered raincoat
he starts slowly advancing toward reggie
where is it lady whereve you got it
terrified i dont know i dont know
i dont she stops as she sees something
instead of a human hand there is a twin pronged metal one
scobie sees where reggie is staring looks down at it himself then lunges at her raising the hand to strike
i want it give it to me its mine
the hand is starting to come down
reggie moving quickly turns and flies out
as reggie runs out slamming the door after her the metal hand crashes against the wooden panel inside the door and splinters through it visible on this side now
petrified with fear reggie can only stare dumbly at the protruding claw
as peter comes running up to her
he sees the metal hand
a man he tried to kill me
pulling her aside peter takes hold of the key still in the outside lock and turns it slowly and quietly
then using all his weight he slams the door open as far as it will go making sure to hold it that way as he steps in
inside peter pulls back the door and slugs the startled scobie full on the jaw
his head bangs against the wall but he manages to raise a foot and push peter violently away sending him sprawling back toppling across the bed and over head first
onto the floor on the other side where he disappears
hurrying scobie puts his foot against the door and pushes it away ripping his metal hand free
he then rushes to the open window and climbs out
reggie waits anxiously
when she hears nothing she gingerly looks into the room
entering cautiously peter
where are you
showing the disarranged room empty of people
then slowly peters hand appears from behind the bed shaking groggily
reggie rushes to him and helps him sit on the bed
peter are you all right
i think i sprained my pride
he looks around whered he go
out of the window i guess i didnt see him
peter goes unsteady on his feet to the window and looks out
he then turns back
lock the door and the window and dont let anyone in except me
ill be back in a minute
be careful peter
one leg over the sill you took the words right out of my mouth
he climbs out
outside the window to reggies room is a small false balcony consisting mostly of railing with barely enough room between it and the buildings facade for a man to stand
peter appears and looks down over the railing
shooting straight down there is no one on the street and it is too far to jump
he now looks around
reggies is the last such balcony on one side but there are two or three on the other
peter climbs over the railing and holding on to it with one hand reaches for the railing on the next balcony
as it stretches for the railing it is several inches short of touching it
as he straightens up and prepares to jump
from the ground
peter high above jumps to the next balcony
as he climbs over the railing of the second balcony
he sees a light coming through the window and looks in
peter leaves the window quickly climbing over the railing on his way to the next balcony
as he does the following exchange is heard in british english
what is it now pamela
it happened again henry another strange man peered in the window at me and then went away
bad luck pamela
from the ground as peter jumps to the next balcony
as he climbs over the rail to the third balcony
there is a light coming from this window too
peter looks in
inside the room are gideon tex and scobie in the midst of a heated discussion
that was a dumb move herman a dumb move
and then some
if youd only told us you was goin to her room we couldve kept em busy but sneakin in there on your own that a way why man you was
bound to get yore tokus kicked
i mean whatd you think hed do walk up n shake you by that hand o yores
thats right herman you didnt leave me much choice
they all turn toward the window
as peter climbs in through the window and joins them
to scobie i didnt hurt you did i
scobie shakes his head and turns away
eagerly never mind that did you get the money
how could i with the three marx brothers breathing down my neck
you said youd let me handle it alone the girl trusts me
if shes got it ill find out about it
but youve got to leave me alone
to gideon and tex we took all the chances
the money belongs to us not him
dont be un neighborly like herman dont forget he done us a little ol favor
he took care of charlie for us
to peter we appreciate it really we do
but who asked him
three shares are enough id say hes out
a third of nothing is nothing herman
make up your minds shes waiting for me
thoughtfully i dont see how another twenty four hours could hurt
shoot no not after all these years
then he gets it out of your share not mine
scobie turns and storms out of the door slamming it
gideon begins sneezing takes a bottle of pills from his pocket and swallows two white tablets
i suggest you get about your business nothing soothes herman like success
chuckling thats right its like ticklin a alligators belly
whos got the room next to hers
get another one will you
im going to need it
peter starts for the door
if you do find the money you wont forget t tell us about it will you fella
turning at the door dont worry
oh i aint worryin but see this pudgy little fella here
indicating gideon he worries an hes even meanern i am
as she waits anxiously smoking a cigarette
there is a knock at the door
who is it
reggie unlocks the door and opens it
peter enters and she closes the door again there was no trace of him
all right reggie suppose you tell me what this is all about
there are three men hes one of them they think i have something that belongs to them
a quarter of a million dollars
peter is silent for a moment
no it isnt wheres the money
i dont know
those men killed charles to get it
but he must not have had it with him on the train
so they think he left it with you
but he didnt
ive looked everywhere tears welling and if i dont find it wailing those men going to kill me
she falls in his arms to be comforted
no they wont i wont let them
sobbing please help me peter youre the only one i can trust
of course ill help i told you i would didnt i
come on now he takes out his handkerchief and dries her eyes
im so hungry i could faint
trying to smile ive ive gotten your suit all wet
thats all right its a drip dry
peter youve got to promise me something
promise youll never lie the way charles did
why do people have to tell lies
usually its because they want something and theyre afraid the truth wont get it for them
do you tell lies
the phone rings
reggie answers it
into the phone hello
scobie holds the receiver in his metal hand
its me the man who was in your room a few minutes ago on the phone what do you want
whispering who is it
covering the receiver the man you had the fight with
on the phone is dyle with you
on the phone the man who hit me lady dyle thats his name
whats wrong is he still there
reggies back is turned to peter so he cant see her face
he watches her
on the phone yes thats right
what is it reggie whats he saying
she shakes her head
on the phone dont trust him dont tell him anything
hes after the money
he hangs up
slowly reggie lowers the phone from her ear and hangs it up
she hesitates a moment
whatd he say
he he said if i didnt give the money hell kill me
i wouldnt take that too seriously
i believe what he said
theyre only trying to scare you thats all
how do you know what theyre doing
i dont but as long as they think you have the money or know where it is or have it without knowing where it is or dont even know you
have it what are you talking about
you mustnt let what he said bother you
it was only words
softly words can hurt very much
a pause go to sleep ill see you in the morning
dont put yourself out
hey im on your side
yes ill remember
he starts out pausing by the door and examining the hole scobie made in it
but if youll take my advice smiling youll undress in the closet
oh and if you need me just bang on the wall
ill be next door
as peter now called dyle leaves reggies room and closes the door
he pauses for a moment listening hears nothing then bends down and starts pulling at a loose thread in one of his socks
as usual the thread unravels and unravels and unravels some more until it seems that the entire sock has come unknit
now taking the long thread he bends down near the door and taking his tie pin attaches one end of the thread to the bottom of reggies door
he then runs the thread along the floor to his door next door and works it underneath
as dyle enters the thread in his hand
he goes to a nearby table where he attaches the thread to the heavy room key which he then balances on the extreme edge of the table
reggie is on the phone
excited but i am calm mr
bartholomew what i called to tell you was theres someone else someone who wasnt in that photograph you showed me
he says his name is peter joshua but it isnt its dyle
a pause mr
are you still there
bartholomew on the phone
he is silent for a moment his face troubled
i dont know who this mr
dyle is but its just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband
on the phone you mean he might have mr
bartholomew im catching the next plane out of here im not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me
on the phone where are you now can you meet me
do you know les halles
on the phone yes where
a pause in fifteen minutes
ill be there
reggie hangs up the phone picks up her bag checks her hair in the mirror then starts for the door
she stops as she notices the connecting door leading to the room next door dyles room
she goes to it silently slips out the key and bends to peer through the keyhole
dyle is removing his coat
before he lays it over a chair he takes a gun from the inside pocket checks it and tucks it into his belt
reggie reacts in surprise and fright jumps quickly away from the door
she hurries to the door leading to the hall and reaches for the knob
close shot room key
the thread attached to it is pulled by the action of reggies door opening and the key falls to the floor with a clatter
including dyle as he reacts his head wheeling to look at the key
snatching his coat he runs for the door
as reggie sneaks past dyles door
when she has passed the door opens and dyle appears
reggie takes off on the run turning the corner and starting down the stairs
he starts after her
it is deserted except for the sleeping night porter as reggie comes running down the stairs
she turns looking back towards the sound of his voice but does not slacken her speed
she runs out the front door
as reggie runs out
she looks up the street sees a taxi and hails it
it pulls over to the curb
looking once more over her shoulder she takes a bill out of her pocket opens the cab door slams it loudly without getting in and hands the bill to the
nimporte ou vite
she jumps back into the shadows of a nearby doorway as the taxi pulls away
at the same time dyle runs out of the hotel
another taxi is coming down the street
dyle hails it frantically
it pulls up and dyle opens the door
pointing follow that taxi
je ne comprends rien
desperately dyle reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a small dictionary and begins flipping through the pages
in the shadows
she lifts her eyes in annoyance
finding the word suivre el taxi
reggie comes out of the shadows looks after dyles taxi then hails another one which pulls up
to driver aux halles vite
reggie and bartholomew walking
the central market is teeming with activity trucks creeping around other trucks cases of fruit and vegetables stacked on every inch of sidewalk workers of all types milling around unloading
trucks and stacking crates little electric carts scooting in and out and nearby one of the huge high roofed sheds where the butchers work
camera leading them as they walk
looking around incredible isnt it
zola called it le ventre de paris the womb of paris the belly
she takes a banana from a nearby stall
peeling it what did you want to see me about mr
leaves a coin on the crate were you followed
yes but i lost him
i really did it quite brilliantly
im beginning to think women make the best spies
he has a gun mr
bartholomew i saw it
dyle or whatever his name is
what does your mr
dyle look like mrs
hes hardly my mr
well hes tall over six feet rather thin in good physical shape id say dark eyes quite handsome really
shaking his head no
thats not carson dyle
theres only one dyle connected with this affair mrs
lampert thats carson
you mean youve known about him all along
why didnt you tell me
bartholomew looks at her for a moment then glances around his attention is drawn inside the doorway
its enough to make you a vegetarian isnt it
almost as far as the eye can see row upon row of beef sides hung on hooks
as reggie looks at the hanging beef
its just lucky that im not hanging next to one of those things right now
she shudders throws away her banana and turns back to mr
bartholomew why didnt you tell me you knew about dyle
i didnt see any point
bartholomew maybe youd better tell me what this things all about
lined up at a zinc bar are several butchers their white smocks stained with blood
reggie and bartholomew sit at the table
i suppose youre old enough to have heard of world war two
in five members of the o
the military espionage unit were ordered behind the german lines for the purpose of delivering in gold to the french underground
the five men a waiter arrives
smiling they always do that
to the waiter cafe
gratinee choucroute garnie salade de pommes et un ballon de rouge
lampert i really hadnt planned on spending the entire night here
can i at least keep the onion soup
to the waiter la soupe tout simplement
the waiter nods and goes
anxiously go on please five men the french underground yes
the five men
they were of course your husband charles the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday and carson dyle
but something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact
it must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money
steal it how
by burying it and then reporting that the germans had captured it
all they had to do was come back after the war dig it up and split it five ways a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked
fascinated may i have a cigarette please
bartholomew pulls out a package and she takes one looks at it and rips off the filter tip
i hate these things its like drinking coffee through a veil
she puts the other end in her mouth then picks up the matches and lights it
everything went smoothly enough until after the gold was buried then before they could get out they were ambushed by a german patrol
a machine gun separated scobie from his right hand and caught carson dyle full in the stomach
reggie takes another cigarette from his pack rips off the filter he winces again and puts it into her mouth
whats wrong with that one
he points to the cigarette she just lit still practically brand new in the ashtray
nothing i guess
what happened then
she hands over the newer one to bartholomew who sadly examines its mutilated end while reggie returns to the first cigarette
have you any idea what these things cost over here
please go on mr
bartholomew what happened then
scobie was able to travel but carson dyle was clearly dying so they the waiter returns with the coffee and onion soup
la soupe cest pour qui
go on mr
the waiter puts down the cup and bowl and leaves
carson was dying so they were forced to leave him
they finally got back to the base made their report and waited for the war to end
only charles couldnt wait quite as long as the others
he beat them back to the gold took everything for himself and disappeared
its taken gideon tex and scobie all this time to catch up with him again
but if they stole all that money why cant you arrest them
we know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together but we still have no proof
but what has all this got to do with the c
were an extension of the wartime o
it was our money and we want it back
im sorry mr
bartholomew but nothing youve told me has changed my mind
i still intend leaving paris tonight
i wouldnt advise that mrs
youd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave
those men wont be very far away no matter where you go
in fact i dont even see any point in your changing hotels
please help us mrs
your government is counting on you
well if im going to die i might as well do it for my country
thats the spirit
oh stop it
what do you want me to do
were anxious to know who this man is the one calling himself dyle
maybe he really is dyle
he could still be alive
but no one actually saw him die
his death is registered with the war department in washington
then whos this one
i dont know but i think youd better find out dont you
youre in an ideal position he trusts you
grinning besides you said yourself women make the best spies
dyle leaves the hotel and turns into the place
a moment later reggie comes cautiously from the hotel
as she watches dyle a sandwich man advertising a driving school passes the hotel
reggie falls in behind him his tall placard hiding her from view
first comes dyle passing a sidewalk cafe on the corner then the sandwich man and reggie
the sandwich man turns off leaving reggie out in the open
a moment later dyle passes a girl painting a canvas her easel set up in the middle of the sidewalk
he stops when he has passed her and turns to look at her work
reggie not knowing what to do and afraid she will be seen by dyle who is now looking her way spins and sits at the sidewalk cafes nearest table her
back to dyle
it is already occupied by a middle aged the tourist complete with camera beret and guide book looks up from his coffee surprised
he stares at reggie and she stares back
finally not knowing what else to do she smiles then takes a portion of his brioche and eats it
he smiles back emptily not knowing what to make of her
reggie turns to look at dyle
he has made his judgment of the painting and now moves on
the tourist has finally found the courage to speak
as he opens his mouth to make a sound reggie her eyes on dyle rises quickly from the table and goes leaving a very confused tourist with his mouth open
he blinks then leaves some money on the table and starts after her
reggie following dyle
as she passes the girl painting she cannot resist turning to see the work
an abstract jumble nothing recognizable
as she looks from the painting to reality
as the scene really looks
she shrugs continues after dyle
now we see that the tourist in turn is following her
calling fraulein reggie doesnt stop
fraulein turning but continuing what are you doing following me
stop it were going to look like a parade
she continues after dyle
the tourist hesitates then continues after her
he goes to the curb and starts to step off attempting to cross the rue danton but finds the light against him
he turns back in reggies direction
realizing she has to do something before dyle spots her she turns and takes the tourists arm and starts walking with him back toward the cafe
smiling and rattling on how are you
when did you arrive in town
are you enjoying paris
its lovely isnt it
so many wonderful things to see and do it makes ones head spin to think of it
she looks back over her shoulder and sees that dyle is now crossing the rue danton heading for the platform of a bus now stopped at the curb
smiling fraulein reggie pulls away from him
if you dont stop following me ill call the police
she leaves him standing there more confused than ever as she starts after dyle again
dyle has hopped on the back of the bus as it pulls away
reggie hurries across the street hailing a taxi
camera panning with him to the head of a stairway leading downstairs a sign indicating that it leads to the mail room telephones
camera pans back to the door as reggie enters
dyle walks to one of several windows
a sign over it reading reggie comes down the stairs
suddenly she stops
camera zooms in to sign on d
a confused look on her face
as his turn comes he addresses the clerk dyle please
d y l e
the clerk takes out a bundle of letters and quickly sorts through it
im sorry mr
dyle nothing today
thanks see you soon
he turns and heads out starting up the stairs where reggie was but is no longer
as he reaches the fourth or fifth step a voice is heard over the loudspeaker
dyle please youre wanted on the telephone mr
dyle stops in his tracks pondering what to do
he stops and comes down the stairs going to the back of the room and into the cabin marked
picking up the phone yes
camera dollies across an empty cabin to discover reggie in the third one on the phone
reggie on the phone
dyle on the phone
good morning mr
its the only name ive got
how about you
no cat and mouse youve got me
what do you want to know
why you lied to me
i had to for all i knew you could have been in on the whole thing
well you know now so please tell me who you are
but you know my name its dyle
carson dyle is dead
yes he is
he was my brother
your the army thinks he was killed in action by the germans but i think they did it tex gideon and scobie and your husband because he wouldnt go along
with their scheme to steal the gold
i think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him
im trying to prove it
they think im working with them
but im not and thats the truth
im on your side reggie please believe that
how can i
you lied to me the way charles did and after promising you wouldnt
oh i want to believe you peter
oh but i cant call you that anymore can i
it will take me a while to get used to your new name which i dont even know yet
what is it
pause arent you going to tell me
she opens the door of the cabin and starts out
as reggie steps out of her cabin and starts looking in the others
they are all occupied except one and she looks inside it
the receiver hangs by its cord swinging back and forth
as she looks at it confused
dyle and scobie stand together waiting for the elevator scobie clearly holding a gun in the pocket of his raincoat
quietly if you do anything funny or try to talk to anyone ill kill you dyle here and now
youll wreck your raincoat
the self service elevator doors open one or two passengers come out and dyle and scobie enter
a young girl starts in after them
next car please
he reaches out and presses the top button with his metal hand
the doors close
as scobie follows dyle out of the elevator
scobie looks around there is an open door at the end of a short hall
he and dyle go to it camera following
through the door which scobie closes behind them is a flight of stairs leading up to a second floor
okay turn around
dyle turns to find scobies gun out of the pocket and pointing at him
scobie now transfers it to his metal hand and goes to dyle where he proceeds to frisk him
finding the gun dyle carries in his inside coat pocket scobie removes it
during the following conversation he will shake open the revolving magazine and let the bullets fall out onto the floor before handing back the emptied gun to dyle
then he will transfer his own gun back to his good hand
shrugging dyle sits on the third step
we wait with our mouths shut
the last employees leave the building as the watchman locks the front door after them
in the semi darkness dyle is still sitting on the third step scobie still facing him with a gun
how long do you intend
i said with the mouth shut
dyle yawns wide
sorry about that
okay up there
dyle gets to his feet and starts up the stairs followed by scobie
dyle stops at the door
do i knock or something
dyle opens the door
the stairs continue up
the view had better be worth it
a spectacular view of the paris rooftops and the city lights beyond
dyle and scobie come out onto a level portion of roof
on the street side the roof angles down abruptly into a steep slate covered pitch broken only by two widely separated oval shaped dormer windows
below these is a rain gutter then nothing for seven stories
ill give you a chance dyle which is more than youd give me
wheres the money
is that why you dragged me all the way up here to ask me that
she has it you know that
and i say maybe you both have it
one more time dyle where is it
supposing i did have it which i dont do you really think id hand it over
youre out dyle right now
scobie aims the gun and starts advancing toward dyle
dyle turns and looks there is nothing behind him but a sheer drop to the street
thats the idea
moving quickly dyle lashes out and hacks scobies gun hand with the side of his palm and the gun falls to the roof
following through dyle punches the large man full in the jaw but instead of falling scobie wraps his arm around dyle holding on tightly until his head clears
then to his amazement dyle is lifted into the air and unable to break the bear hold carried toward the edge of the roof
working his arms between their two bodies dyle suddenly flails them out with all his strength and the hold is broken but at the price of his coat and the
flesh on his back as scobies metal claw rips through both a wound extending from the center of dyles back to his shoulder
both men look around for the gun spot it simultaneously and leap for it both landing short of the mark
now they grapple with one another each trying to break free and reach for the gun
two hands one real one metal inch toward the gun
the battle is going to scobie whose weight and strength are beginning to tire dyle who is now on his back trying to stop scobie from crawling over him
he has the large man by both lapels of the raincoat in a last ditch effort to hold him
but scobie his face horribly distorted from the strain continues to inch forward toward the gun
suddenly dyle releases his hold
with nothing restraining him scobie lurches forward tumbling past the gun his momentum carrying him onto the sloping part of the roof where he begins sliding down
scobie beats wildly at the the slate with his claw trying to gouge a grip
as it slides across the slate making a hideous scratching sound and causing sparks to fly
as he slides over the edge and disappears
as he watches hypnotized
there appears to be no sign of scobie
then camera zooms in for a tight close shot of scobies metal hand gripping the rain gutter at the very edge
having seen the claw he rises and walks to the very edge of the level part of the roof
as he hangs seven stories over the street by his metal hand
he finds it hard to believe
how are you doing
how do you think
if you get bored try writing love thy neighbor a hundred times on the side of the building
dyle turns and leaves going down the stairs
the hotel manager is busy taping a piece of cardboard over the hole ripped in reggies door by scobies metal hand the night before
dyle leaves the elevator and goes to his own door
the manager eyes him coldly
dyle takes the look
i didnt do it
the next time madame forgets her key there is another one at the desk
dyle smiles then enters his room
he closes the door and starts to remove his torn coat wincing
reggie smoking on the bed sits up when she hears dyle moving about in his room
she goes to the connecting door unlocks her side tries the knob finds it still bolted from his side and knocks
is that you
dyle goes to the door throws back the bolt and opens the door
didnt anyone ever tell you its impolite to seeing his injured back what happened
i met a man with sharp nails
i left him hanging around the american express
come on ive got something that stings like crazy
she leads him into her room
as reggie and dyle enter from his room
she leads him to the bed
take off your shirt and lie down
as reggie goes to the bathroom dyle takes off his torn shirt revealing a torn and bloody t shirt
he lies face downwards on the bed
reggie returns carrying cotton gauze tape scissors and disinfectant
she sits next to him and lifts up his t shirt to examine the wound
wincing listen all i really want is an estimate
its not so bad
you may not be able to lie on your back for a few days but then you can lie from any position cant you
she wets the cotton with disinfectant and begins cleaning the wound
does it hurt
havent you got a bullet i can bite
she continues working on his back cleaning it then bandaging it while they talk
are you really carson dyles brother
would you like to see my passport
what kind of a proof is that
would you like to see where i was tattooed
okay ill drive you around there some day
his back stinging ouch
you could at least tell me what your first name is these days
is there a mrs
yes but were divorced
i thought that was peter joshua
smiling im no easier to live with than he was
finishing the bandage there youre a new man
as they continue talking he rises from the bed and goes into his own room
reggie remains on the bed watching him through the open door as he puts on a fresh t shirt and shirt
im sorry i couldnt tell you the truth but i had to find out your part in all this
alex how can you tell if someone is lying or not
there must be some way
theres an old riddle about two tribes of indians the whitefeet always tell the truth and the blackfeet always lie
so one day you meet an indian you ask him if hes a truthful whitefoot or a lying blackfoot
he tells you hes a truthful whitefoot but which one is he
why couldnt you just look at his feet
because hes wearing moccasins
well then hes a truthful whitefoot of course
why not a lying blackfoot
confused which one are you
entering smiling whitefoot of course
he goes to the bed
i hope it turns out youre a whitefoot alex i could be very happy hanging around the tepee
reggie listen to me oh oh here it comes
the fatherly talk
you forget im already a widow
so was juliet at fifteen
im not fifteen
well theres your trouble right there youre too old for me
why cant you be serious
there you said it
when a man gets to be my age thats the last word he ever wants to hear
i dont want to be serious and i especially dont want you to be
okay ill tell you what well just sit around all day long being frivolous how about that
she starts kissing him on the neck on the chin on the cheek
now please reggie cut it out
pulling back okay
what are you doing
cutting it out
who told you to do that
but im not through complaining yet
she starts kissing him again now please reggie cut it out
i think i love you alex she kisses him on the mouth
the phone rings
he tries to talk as she continues kissing him
mumbling the phones ringing whoever it is wont give up and neither will i
the phone continues to ring and she continues to kiss him
finally reggie reaches out to the bedstand and takes the phone off the hook
she brings the receiver up to their mouths and mumbles into it
on phone sorry i was just uh nibbling on something
tex speaks into the phone
miz lampert my buddies n me wed oblige it mighty highly if you could mosey on across the hall n chew the fat with us for a spell
dyle is watching her
on the phone can you give me one good reason why i should

she covers the phone and turns to dyle in alarm
theyve got jean louis
that sounds like their problem

on the phone well be waitin in room forty seven miz lampert so you just wiggle on over
as reggie hangs up
what day is it
lord i forgot all about it sylvie works late tuesday nights she always leaves him with me
they wouldnt do anything to a little boy would they
i dont know it depends on whether or not theyve already eaten
close shot jean louis
he looks around uncertainly first one way then the other
camera pulls back to show him sitting on scobies knee the large man holding him with his good hand the metal one in his pocket
tex sits next to them while gideon nervously paces the floor
when gideon begins sneezing he takes the small bottle of pills from his pocket and downs one or two swallowing some water
hey tex move the kid to the other knee or something will you
my legs going to sleep
tex lifts jean louis and puts him down on scobies other knee
are you a real cowboy
then where is your gun
taking out his gun right here see
will you put that thing away
a knock at the door
gideon goes to open it
reggie and dyle enter
she sees jean louis and texs gun
she snatches him off scobies lap
howdy miz lampert
glaring at dyle who invited you
hello herman it was a happy landing i see
id better call sylvie she must be frantic
she starts for the door with jean louis
gideon blocks her way
im afraid that will have to wait mrs
but his mother she isnt going to be anybodys mother unless you answer some questions
this aint no game miz lampert
we want that money now
forcefully be quiet all of you
the three men look at him surprised by his tone
and stop threatening that boy
he doesnt have the money
lampert doesnt either
then who does
i dont know herman maybe you do
to tex or you to gideon or you together thats the most ridiculous
you gone loco
listen to the man
suppose one of you found charles here in paris followed him cornered him on the train threw him out the window and took the money
after a pause thats a crock
if one of us did that he wouldnt hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up
but hed have to
if he left hed be admitting his guilt and the others would know what happened
whoever it is has to wait here pretending to look for the money waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home
thats when hell be safe and not a minute before
a pause as the three men look at one another
up till now we always figured she had the money but you know so much about it maybe youve got it
then what am i doing here
you didnt know anything about me im the only one who could have taken it and kept right on going
hes just tryin to throw us off
theyve got it i tell you
why dont we search their rooms
exchanging looks with reggie its all right with us rising what are we wastin time for
and while were waiting we might as well go through yours
stopping not my room
whats wrong herman have you got something to hide
a pause then smiling then i take it there are no objections
the three men look at one another unhappily
wed better exchange keys
ill take that
he takes dyles key and gives dyle his
gideon goes to reggie takes her key and gives her his own
mines in the door
ariva durchy yall
the three men file out
dyle and reggie exchange looks
come on lets get busy
who gets your vote
scobie hes the one that objected
handing her the boy hes all yours
ill do tex and gideon
take jean louis with you and make sure you bolt the door from inside
viens jean louis were going to have a treasure hunt
joining them oh la
if i find the treasure will i win a prize
to dyle what should we give him
or do you think it would spoil him
she smiles takes jean louis hand and leaves
dyle turns to survey texs room
he goes first to the drawer in the night table empty and the bed looking in it and under it
then he goes to the desk and opens the drawers also empty
the bureau is next he opens all three double drawers and they too are completely empty
frowning he goes to the armoire and opens it shelves and hanging bar are likewise bare
then camera panning down he sees the only thing hes found so far in the room a pair of fine cowboy boots
close shot airlines bag
camera pulls back to include gideon staring down at it as it lies on the table in the center of the room
eyes on the bag tex
including tex busy going through the bureau
he looks up then joins gideon
gideon empties the contents of the bag on the table then starts examining the various items
he opens the wallet
inside the initials c
are printed in gold
looks like it
mebbe wed better call herman
gideon has put the wallet aside and now picks up the letter removing it from the envelope and reading it
if its not here why bother him
and if it is
a pause why bother him
a broad grin from tex
they continue going through the items from the bag
you sure nuthins missin
the police have kindly provided us with a list
tex takes the list examines it then folds it and puts it in his pocket
they finish with the items from the bag
there sure aint nothin here worth no quarter of a million
not unless were blind
staring at gideon you think that mebbe were fishin the wrong stream
you dont spose one o us has it like the man said i mean thatd be pretty distasteful us bein vetrans o the same war n all
very sincerely you know id tell you if i had it
jus like id tell you
and that goes for herman too
the two men look at one another then smile then laugh
reggie on the phone jean louis standing by
hes all right sylvie honestly
just hurry up and get here
she hangs up and turns to jean louis
come on now if you wanted to hide something where would you put it
i would bury it in the garden
swell only this man doesnt have a garden
afterthought neither do i
seeing something voila
pointing up there
i would put it up there
reggie looks to where jean louis is pointing to the top of the high armoire
you know something cookie
taking one of the straight chairs to the armoire she stands on it
although she is still not high enough to see anything by standing on tip toes she is able to reach with her hand over the top and grope around blindly
i hope i dont find any little hairy things living up here wait
there is something
if i can just yes im getting it a case of some sort its heavy
jumping up and down i found it
i found it
if you think youre getting credit for this youre crazy
ecstatic we won
reggie has finally managed to pull down the case a rectangular black bag about the size and shape of a trombone case
as he climbs off the chair jean louis suddenly runs to the door unbolts it and runs into the hall camera panning with him
as jean louis runs out into the hall shouting
we found it
we found it
dyle is the first one to appear coming out of gideons room
tex has also appeared from reggies room followed by gideon
we found it
the three men rush by jean louis and squeeze simultaneously into scobies room
as dyle tex and gideon enter reggie is placing the little straight black chair to its original position
there is no sign of the black case
did you find it
what do you mean no
the kid said pointing atop the armoire up there
it is up there
no jean louis
tex grabs the chair and moves it to the armoire climbing up on it and grabbing the bag
its nothing i tell you
he brings it to the table as dyle and gideon crowd around him anxious to see
the ring of faces one at a time
tex his jaw muscles working feverishly dyle his eyes unblinking a slight smile on his lips gideon his mouth open greedily
as tex finally springs the latches and opens the lid
inside neatly packed in velvet fittings like the parts of a musical instrument are various portions of and attachments for a metal artificial hand
jumpin frejoles its hermans spare
as they stare at the case surprised and just a little embarrassed
slowly tex lowers the lid
the men avoid looking at one another
including reggie and jean louis by the door
where is he
the men look at one another
hey thats right
already running hes in my room
the three men hurry past reggie and jean louis and out of the door
what is the matter
dyle tex and gideon followed by reggie and jean louis cross the hall to dyles room
dyle turns the key which is still in the door
he enters followed by the others
dyle tex and gideon stand in the center of the room looking around
reggie and jean louis wait in the open doorway
the room looks like a cyclone hit the place but there is no sign of scobie
the sound of running water can be heard coming from behind the closed door to the bathroom and dyle is the first to notice the water beginning to leak out
from under the door
reggie you and the boy better wait here
scobie still dressed in his raincoat lies face up his head submerged in the filled tub the water now pouring over the edge
his face is distorted
dyles hand appears and turns off the water
dyle tex and gideon staring at camera
now whoda done a mean thing like that
looking carefully at both im not quite sure
this aint my room
considering the situation the police arent going to like this one bit
helpful we could dry him off and take him down the hall to his own room
looking at the body he really doesnt look so bad
we could put him to bed n let one o them fem de chambers find him in the mornin
dyle and gideon look at one another
poor ol herman him n good luck always was strangers
maybe now hell meet up with his other hand someplace but i sure hope it aint waitin for him in heaven
close shot scobie
the dead mans eyes are open his jaw hanging his head lying crazily on the pillow
camera pulls back to show him lying in bed dressed in his pajamas
camera whirls for a tight close shot of a maid her eyes widening as the realization that the man is dead strikes her
then she screams
close shot grandpierre
the policeman is apoplectic
camera pulls back to include reggie dyle tex and gideon all sitting silently in the inspectors office
a man drowned in his bed impossible
and in his pajamas the second one in his pajamas cest trop bete
stop lying to me tapping the side of his nose this nose tells me when you are lying it is never mistaken not in twenty three years this nose will
make me commissaire of police
tapping his fingers on his desk mr
dyle or mr
joshua which is it
and yet you registered in megeve as mr
do you know it is against the law to register under an assumed name
no i didnt
its done in america all the time
grandpierre raps for silence on his desk
during the pause he looks into each face in turn
none of you will be permitted to leave paris until this matter is cleared up
only i warn you i will be watching
we use the guillotine in this country i have always suspected that the blade coming down causes no more than a slight tickling sensation on the back of the neck
it is only a guess of course i hope none of you ever finds out for certain
reggie and dyle walking along the quai next to the seine who do you think did it gideon
youre a big help
can i have one of those
they have passed an ice cream wagon on the corner of the pont au double
to the vendor vanille chocolat
during the following the vendor makes a double decker cone and hands it to reggie
dyle pays and they resume their walk all with no break in the dialogue
i think tex did it
because i really suspect gideon and it is always the person you dont suspect
do women think its feminine to be so illogical or cant they help it
whats so illogical about that
a its always the person you dont suspect b that means you think its tex because you really suspect gideon therefore c if you think its tex it has to
be someone else gideon
i guess they just cant help it
you know i cant help feeling rather sorry for scobie
a pause wouldnt it be nice if we were like that
what like scobie
no gene kelly
remember the way he danced down there next to the river in american in paris without a care in the world
this is good want some
she offers him her cone thrusting it forward with enough force to dislodge the ice cream
it lands right next to his lapel over his outside breast pocket
frowning id love some thanks
he pulls open the pocket with two sticky fingers and looks inside then shakes his head sadly at what he sees
reggie still holds the empty cone not knowing what to do with it
seeing this he takes it and sticks it into his pocket
no sense messing up the streets
dont worry im not going to hit you
no about scobie i mean
i cant think of any reason why he was killed
they resume walking
maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many what makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three
he wants it all alex that means were in his way too
yes i know
first your brother then charles now scobie weve got to do something
any minute now we could be assassinated
would you do anything like that
no including the cathedral of notre dame in the background
swing down from there on a rope to save the woman you love like charles laughton in the hunchback of notre dame
as reggie and dyle step from the elevator
hurry up and change im starved
let me know what you want ill pick a suit that matches
he goes into his room and she goes into hers
she enters fixes her hair in the mirror then goes to the door connecting her room with dyles
she unlocks it tries to open it but finds it locked
disappointed she knocks
what do you want
its the house detective why havent you got a girl in there
he calls to her through the closed door as he empties his pockets
lord youre a pest
can i come in
id like to take a bath
wouldnt it be better if you did it in my room
i wouldnt want to use that tub
besides i dont want to be alone
im only next door if anything happens holler
he sits down to take off his shoes but is interrupted by the sound of reggie screaming
he races for the connecting door pulls back the bolt and rushes in
as dyle enters
he wheels as the door is slammed and reggie who had been standing behind it locks it and pockets the key
did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf
the showers in there
he goes to the door leading to the hall and finds that locked as well
she smiles at him
warning reggie open the door
this is a ludicrous situation
there must be dozens of men dying to use my shower
then i suggest you call one of them
i dare you
dyle looks at her then sits down and starts to remove his shoes
has she gone too far
what are you doing
have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on
to himself what a nut
shoes off dyle starts for the bathroom humming
i usually sing a medley of old favorites when i bathe any requests
shut the door
i dont think i know that one
testing the water with his hand he now steps in fully dressed
reggie cant believe her eyes
she goes to the open door for a closer look
what on earth are you doing
in the shower making sure his suit gets uniformly soaked
explaining pleasantly drip dry
he takes the soap and begins washing as if he were washing himself without the suit
the suit needs it more than i do anyway
how often do you go through this little ritual
as he takes out his handkerchief and rinses it
the manufacturer recommends it
i dont believe it
he opens his coat and reads a label inside
wearing this suit during washing will help protect its shape
he flicks a little water in her face then takes the nail brush and scrubs his watch and watch band
he holds up his wrist so she can see the watch
he begins unbuttoning his suit
she turns and leaves slamming the door after her
as reggie goes to the armoire to select a dress
the phone rings and she answers it
into phone yes
on the phone mrs
ive spoken to washington mrs
lampert on the phone go ahead mr
bartholomew im listening
on the phone i told them what you said about this man being carson dyles brother
i asked them what they knew about it and they told me youre not gonna like this mrs
lampert they told me carson dyle has no brother
close shot reggie on the phone looking like the rug has been pulled out from under her
pause quietly are you sure theres no mistake
on the phone none whatsoever
lampert be careful
reggie slowly lowers the phone to its cradle a worried expression on her face
then the bathroom door opens and dyle appears dressed in a large bath towel
her back is to him
i left all my drip dry dripping is it all right
she doesnt answer
reggie is something wrong
she shakes her head
youre probably weak from hunger
youve only had five meals today
hurry up and well go out
she turns and looks at him
do you mind if we go someplace crowded
i i feel like lots of people tonight
the large motor launch moving along the river gaily ablaze with lights
at a table for two by the rail the city slowly passing in the b
reggie you havent spoken a word in twenty minutes
i keep thinking about charles and scobie and the one whos going to be next me
nothings going to happen to you while im around i want you to believe that
how can i believe it when you dont even know who the killer is
ive got that right havent i
you dont know who did it
no not yet
but then if we sit back and wait the field should start narrowing down shouldnt it
whoevers left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination wouldnt you say so
are you trying to say that i might have killed charles and scobie
she doesnt answer
what do i have to do to satisfy you become the next victim
its a start anyway
i dont understand you at all one minute youre chasing me around the shower room and the next youre accusing me of murder
carson dyle didnt have a brother
she rises from the table and walks away
dyle hesitates a moment then follows
i can explain if youll just listen
will you listen
looking at the river i cant very well leave without a pair of water wings
then get set for the story of my life not that it would ever make the best seller list
fiction or non fiction
why dont you shut up
are you going to listen
after i graduated college i was all set to go into my father business
umbrella frames thats what he made
it was a sensible business i suppose but i didnt have the sense to be interested in anything sensible
i suppose all this is leading somewhere
it led me away from umbrella frames for one thing
but that left me without any honest means of support
what do you mean
when a man has no profession except the one he loathes whats left
i began looking for people with more money than theyd ever need including some theyd barely miss
astonished you mean youre a thief
well it isnt exactly the term id have chosen but i suppose it captures the spirit of the thing
i dont believe it
well i cant really blame you not now
but i do believe it thats what i dont believe
so its goodbye alexander dyle welcome home peter joshua
sorry the names adam canfield
do you realize youve had three names in the past two days
i dont even know who im talking to any more
now called adam the mans the same even if the name isnt
no hes not the same
alexander dyle was interested in clearing up his brothers death
adam canfield is a crook
and with all the advantages youve got brains charm education a handsome face oh come on
there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do
i want to know what it is
i like what i do i enjoy doing it
there arent many men who love their work as much as i do
look around some time
is there a mrs
yes but together were divorced
now go eat your dinner
they walk back to the table where a waiter is busy putting food on it mostly on reggies side
miserably i could eat a horse
looking at all the food i think thats what you ordered
dont you dare to be civil with me
all this time you were leading me on how was i leading you on
all that marvelous rejection you knew i couldnt resist it
now it turns out you were only interested in the money
what would you like me to say that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars
no i guess not
its a toss up i can tell you that
dont you know im having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you
reggie reacts in surprise
oh you should see your face
what about it
taking her hand nicely its lovely
she looks at him with happy amazement then pushes her plate away
whats the matter
im not hungry isnt it glorious
the lights go out
its all right look
a searchlight near the boats bridge has gone on and now begins sweeping the river banks
on benches by the waters edge lovers are surprised by the bright light which suddenly and without warning discovers them in various attitudes of mutual affection
some are embarrassed some are amused and some the most intimate damn annoyed
one even shakes his fist at the light
who like everyone else leave the table and stand together at the rail watching
you dont look so bad in this light
why do you think i brought you here
indicating the lovers i thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out
pretty good huh
i taught them everything they do
did they do that sort of thing way back in your day
how do you think i got here
she rises on tip toes and kisses him gently his only reaction is to look at her
arent you allowed to kiss back
the doctor said it would be bad for my thermostat
she kisses him again
he responds a little better
when you come on you really come on
well come on
she starts to kiss him again but he stops her
i know why youre not taken no one can catch up with you
relax youre gaining
as he sits bolt upright in bed startled
the room is dark and the phone is ringing
he switches on the lamp looks at the clock it reads and shakes his head before picking up the receiver
you must be crazy its three thirty in the morning you mean now
all right ill be down in a minute
he hangs up swings his feet out of bed and spears his slippers reaching for his robe at the same time
then he shuffles sleepily to the door
as gideon comes out of his room and goes to the elevator
the cage is there
he opens the door and enters
gideon closes the sliding grill and presses a button
the cage starts down
gideon begins sneezing
suddenly the elevator stops between floors and the lights go out
turn on the lights
just as suddenly the lights go back on and the elevator starts moving down again
gideon shakes his head and leans back whistling again
the cage comes to his floor and starts past it
seeing this gideon looks confused
the night porter is asleep behind the desk
the elevator gideon inside keeps coming down
it passes the lobby level and keeps right on going toward the basement
how do you stop this thing
the elevator passes out of sight still going down
there is a silence as the motor stops and then a series of sneezes that ends with a terrifying shriek
the night porter rudely awakened runs to the elevator shaft his shoes squeaking horribly
he looks up sees nothing then looks down
he presses the call button and the motor starts
an instant later the cage appears and stops
the night porter opens the gate pulls back the grill and the camera rushes past him to pick up gideon
his body is sitting on the floor of the cage its grotesque sprawling attitude resembling a puppets with its strings cut
except that gideon has no strings to cut only a throat
from ear to ear
close shot grandpierre
he is now doubly apoplectic
three of them all in their pajamas
what is it some new american fad
camera pulls back to reveal reggie and adam in their bathrobes
and now your friend the one from texas he has disappeared checked out pouf
into thin air
where is he
i dont know
tell me mr
dyle where were you at three thirty
in my room asleep
and you mrs
i was too
bitterly no in my room
pause lighting cigar it stands to reason you are telling the truth for why would you invent such a ridiculous story
reggie and adam exchange looks
and if i were you i would not stay in my pajamas
grandpierre turns and leaves
reggie and adam start down the hall toward their own rooms
that wraps it up tex has the money
go back to bed ill let you know when ive found him
youre going to look for him now
if the police find him first theyre not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us are they
adam theres no time ill call you in the morning
adam disappears into his own room
as adam enters going to the closet to remove his suit
the phone rings
he answers it
close shot tex
as he speaks on the phone
now dyle you listen to me my mama didnt raise no stupid children
i know whos got the money n i aint disappearing till i got my share n my shares growin a whole lot bigger evry day
on the phone where are you ol buddy
on the phone laughs ill tell you what fella you want t find me you jus turn round from now on ill be right behind you
hangs up adam before hanging up reflects on texs words then looks behind him
smiling softly he hangs up the phone and starts for reggies door
reggie slips back into her robe and goes to the connecting door
what is it
she undoes the bolt and opens the door
i think we were wrong about tex having the money
i just heard from him hes still hungry
that means killing gideon didnt get it for him so hes narrowed it down to us
youve got it
ive looked adam you know i have wheres that airlines bag
lord youre stubborn
i sure am
she goes to the closet and gets the bag
charles must have had the money with him on the train and tex missed it
he takes the bag to the bed where he dumps out the contents
but everyone and his aunt lilians been through that bag
somebody would have seen it
lets look anyway
lord youre stubborn
i mean its there reggie
if only we could see it
were looking at it right now
something on that bed is worth a quarter of a million dollars
yes but what
i dont know i just dont know
as adam begins to examine the items one by one
electric razor comb steamship ticket fountain pen four passports toothbrush wallet he goes through the wallet finds nothing key what about that
to the apartment it matches mine perfectly
the letter he takes it out of the envelope and takes out his glasses before reading it
ill bet you dont really need those
he hands her the glasses and she looks through them
you need them
she hands them back reading the letter it still doesnt make sense but it isnt worth any quarter of a million either
have we forgotten anything
the tooth powder
wait a minute could you recognize heroin just by tasting it
he shakes some powder into his hand and tastes it
reggie watches expectantly
heroin peppermint flavored heroin
well i guess thats it dead end
go to bed
youve got to be at work in the morning
theres nothing more we can do tonight
pause i love you adam
yes you told me
no last time i said i love you alex
the ultra modern glass and concrete structure behind the ecole militaire
several delegates identified by little plaques in front of them listing their respective nations and their aides sit around the large table
they are all wearing earphones

tutto e questo e molto importante per il governo che io ho lonore di rappresentare disturberebbe lesportazione delle derrate farinose italiane in questa parte del mondo
signori delegati vi ringrazio della vostra attenzione
reggie wearing her headset is talking with sylvie
i hope jean louis understands about last night its just not safe for him to be around me right now
dont be silly he would not do anything
he is not yet old enough to be interested in girls
he says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age
hold it italy just finished
theyre recognizing great britain
oh la vache
sylvie jumps up and rushes next door into her booth shutting the door after her
the british delegate rises to speak continuing through the next scene
chairman fellow delegates my distinguished colleague from italy
her majestys delegation has listened with great patience to the southern european position on this problem and while we find it charmingly stated we cannot possibly agree with its content
in in the british colonies of kenya uganda and tanganyika and if im not mistaken more or less in somaliland a programme of crop rotation was instituted vis a vis
arable land which had never before known the plough beginning before the soil was able to know the sort of fatigue now plaguing most of western europe
in therefore her majestys government at that time his majestys government was able to properly assay the situation
we therefore oppose the resolution
the door from the hall opens and adam enters
reggie i think ive found stopping are you on
no its all right
whats wrong adam
i think i found something
i was snooping around texs room and i found this in the waste basket
ive stuck it back together
he hands her a paper
the one grandpierre gave reggie
it has been torn in half and scotch taped back together
its the receipt inspector grandpierre gave me for charless things
i dont see how thats going to you didnt look
last night when we went through the airlines bag something was missing
showing her the list one agenda
it wasnt there
i remember grandpierre looking through it
but there was nothing in it at least nothing that the police thought was very important
can you remember anything at all
grandpierre asked me about an appointment charles had on the day he was killed
i think it only said where but i cant think reggie youve got to think it may be what were looking for
that moneys not ours adam if we keep it well be breaking the law
we didnt steal it
theres no law against stealing stolen money
of course there is
well i cant say i think very much of a silly law like that
think reggie please think what was written in charles notebook
well it was a place a street corner i think
but i dont hearing something through her earpiece hold it
she turns back to the conference flips a switch and starts speaking into her headset
chairman fellow delegates my distinguished colleague from great britain the french delegate is speaking
monsieur le president messieurs les delegues mon distingue collegue de la grande bretagne le probleme vu par mon gouvernement nest pas aussi simple que nos amis les anglais voudraient nous
le faire croire
mais leur pays nest pas apres tout un pays agricole nest ce pas
la position francaise ainsi que nous lavons soulignee dans le rapport numero trente neuf bar oblique cinquante deux de la conference de lhemisphere occidental qui a eu lieu le mars
reggie is busy translating
as outlined in report number three nine stroke five two of the western hemisphere conference held on march she stops no wait
it was last thursday five oclock at the jardin des champs elysees
adam that was it
its thursday today and its almost five come on
from reggies and adams angle
all the delegates and their aides suddenly turn surprised and look at camera
from the delegates angle
inside the booth reggie and adam can be seen heading for the door in a hurry
as the delegates look at one another confused
by the locked gate
five oclock thursday the garden its got to be something around here
but charles appointment was last week not i know but this is all weve got left
well youre right there
ten minutes ago i had a job
if we find the money ill buy you an international conference all your own
now start looking
you take this side and ill poke around over there
a quick succession of shots showing
childrens merry go round
rond point de champs elysees with fountains playing
balloon salesman adam stands by the large fountain staring off at something as reggie joins him
its hopeless i dont even know what were looking for
its all right i dont think tex does either
you mean hes here too
he stands near the merry go round looking at something in his hand charles agenda
now he closes it and moves off disappearing behind a hedge
id better see what hes up to
stay here i wont be long
adam starts off
concerned be careful adam please
hes already killed three men
between the curb and the jardin several temporary wooden booths have been set up
they have collected quite a crowd
into this area comes tex followed at a safe distance by adam
suddenly tex stops
as he stares wide eyed at something
neatly displayed on a counter of one of the booths
as he wheels to look at another booth
in another arrangement
he turns crazily to look at another booth then another
various flash shots of stamps of all sizes shapes and colors
as he understands
he turns to rush off and bumps smack into adam
tex is startled
sorry fella he rushes off past adam who watches him for a moment confused then turns toward the booth not yet having seen the stamps
from adams angle
there are one or two persons standing at the booth
camera zooms in on the display of stamps
amazed the letter
he quickly turns to find tex
as he hops into the back of a taxi and it pulls away from the curb
adam runs toward another taxi
as adam comes up the stairs and goes to reggies door
whipping out his gun he flings open the door
from adams angle
tex sits in the armchair staring at camera
next to him is the airlines bag its contents dumped on the floor
including adam as he enters his gun trained on tex
without speaking he goes to the airlines bag then stoops down to go through the spilled contents keeping one eye all the time on tex
but he cant find what hes looking for
quietly all right wheres the letter
the letter aint worth nuthin
you know what i mean the envelope with the stamps
i want it
a pause then beginning to laugh you greenhorn you half witted thick skulled hare brained greenhorn
they wuz both too smart for us
what are you talking about
first her husband now her she hoodwinked you
she batted all them big eyes and you went n fell for it like a egg from a tall chicken
holding out the envelope you want
here its yours
adam takes it and looks at it
the corner containing the stamps is missing torn off
tex sees the expression on adams face and begins laughing hysterically
look at you
horn swoggled by a purty face n all them sweet words
you killed all three of em for nothin
you block headed jackass
you clod you booby you nincompoop
reggie is looking around for adam
she sees something across the street
camera spins around to discover sylvie sitting alone on a bench near the stamp market reading a newspaper
as reggie approaches her
what are you doing here
looking up hello reggie i am waiting for jean louis
looking around whats he up to
he was so excited when he got the stamps you gave him this morning
he said he had never seen any like them
but whats all this
the stamp market of course it is here every thursday afternoon
this is where jean louis trades his as it dawns good lord
where is he
sylvie weve got to find him
whats the matter cherie
those stamps theyre worth a fortune
jumping up what
hurry weve got to find him
they rush off into the market
as they stop among the booths looking around
i dont see him
we will separate you look over there
they go off in opposite directions
as she hurries along a row of stalls weaving around small groups of men standing together showing each other stamps
searching in another section of the market
calling jean louis
spotting a boy she runs to him and spins him around
but it isnt
suddenly she sees something
only a small boys elbow and part of his arm show the rest hidden by all the legs
she recognizes him from these fragments
she rushes to him camera panning with her
jean louis stands looking at some stamps
sylvie grabs him
jean louis les timbres ou sont ils
smiling jean louis holds up an enormous sack of assorted stamps hundreds of them
calling reggie reggie
reggie runs up and joins them
jean louis thank heavens
do you have
spotting the sack of stamps whats that
a man traded with me all those for only four
what man jean louis where
jean louis looks in one direction then in the other trying to remember
vite mon ange vite
la bas monsieur felix
they all run off down the line of booths
jean louis stops and points off
il est la
closed deserted empty
but he is gone
i dont blame him
jean louis do you know where this monsieur felix lives
no but i will ask
he goes to the closest booth and shakes the coat sleeve of the proprietor
monsieur theophile oui jeune homme
monsieur felix ou habite il
a montmartre demande a monsieur august au bar des artistes place blanche
merci monsieur theophile
returning to reggie and sylvie he says to ask monsieur august at the before he can finish sylvie who has heard theophile has jean louis by the hand dragging him
off at full speed reggie right alongside
a bare unkempt little room
felix a man in his sixties sits at a table smoking a pipe
there are stamps and albums everywhere
he holds a magnifying glass in his hand busy studying something on the table
there is a knock
he looks up
the door opens and reggie followed by sylvie and jean louis enters
without looking up i was expecting you
you are american too of course
looking at sylvie yes
the man who bought them last week was american
i did not see him but i heard
i knew you would come
he gestures for reggie to come closer
together with sylvie and jean louis she goes to the table and looks at the stamps
look at them madame
four of them a red a yellow a blue and a green still attached to the portion of the torn envelope
have you ever in your entire life seen anything so beautiful
im im sorry i dont know anything about stamps
i know them as one knows his own face even though i have never seen them
this yellow one a swedish four shilling called de gula fyraskillingen issued in
how much is it worth
the money is unimportant
im afraid it is important
shrugging in your money perhaps
do you mind if i sit down
she sits what about the blue one
it is called the hawaiian blue and there are only seven left
in the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it
whats its value today
in human life
forty five thousand
to sylvie do you have anything to eat
to felix and the orange one what about the orange one
a two penny mauritius issued in
not so rare as the others perhaps
and the last one
the best for the last le chef doeuvre de la collection
it is the most valuable stamp in the world
it is called the gazette guyanne
it was printed by hand on colored paper in and marked with the initials of the printer
looking at it through the glass today it has a value of
a pause eh bien i am not a thief
i knew there was some mistake
hesitating you gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return monsieur felix are they for sale now
looking at the large bag let me see
there are european asian american african and twelve princess grace commemorative which comes to nine francs fifty
fishing money from her purse heres ten
felix goes to his wallet for the change
please keep it
i am a tradesman madame not a doorman
and dont forget these
he hands her the four stamps and her change
im im sorry
for a few minutes they were mine that is enough
as reggie comes hurrying up the stairs
she goes first to adams room and knocks
its me reggie
there is no answer
she goes to her own door and to her surprise finds it an inch or two ajar
as reggie enters
she freezes having seen something on the floor
his dead body lies on the floor the wrists of his extended arms tied to the leg of the bed his ankles to the steam radiator
and tied around his head is a plastic transparent bag inside of which the suffocated mans face the eyes bulging against the plastic clinging tight to his features can be
seen all too clearly
reggie enters the shot bending down to see if hes alive
then she sees something beside his hands near the leg of the bed
with his dying effort tex has traced a name against the grain of the maroon carpet dyle
astonished and horrified
gasping dyle as she gets to her feet and hurries to the phone
on the phone hello balzac sil vous plait waiting mr
thank god youre there
tex is dead mr
bartholomew smothered and adam did it he killed them all
bartholomew his face lathered for a shaving is on the phone
just a minute mrs
lampert youd better give that to me slowly
on the phone the one who said he was dyles brother of course im sure tex wrote the word dyle before he died
hes the murderer i tell you hes the only one left
youve got to do something
on the phone calm down mrs
does he have the money
on the phone no i do it was the stamps on that letter charles had with him on the train
they were in plain sight all the time but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope
on the phone the envelope imagine that
lampert listen to me youre not safe as long as youve got these stamps
go to the embassy right away wait id better meet you halfway its quicker
now lets see do you know the center garden at the palais royal
yes by the colonnade as soon as you can get there
on the phone yes im leaving now goodbye
she hangs up looks briefly at texs body shudders then hurries to the door
as reggie leaves her room and goes to the elevator
she presses the button then notices it is in use
she goes to the stairs and starts down
between the landings
the stairs curve around the open elevator shaft
as reggie comes down the stairs the cage rises into view
inside is adam
for a moment she stops and their eyes meet
reggie the stamps whatve you done with
reggie starts running downstairs
where are you going
adam pushes the emergency stop button and then starts the cage down
as reggie comes off the stairs passes the elevator gate and starts down toward the lobby the cage a few feet behind her
as reggie continues to run
between the first landing and the lobby
reggie running the elevator following
so you can kill me too
tex is dead ive seen him
he said dyle did it
im not dyle you know that
but tex didnt he still thought dont be an idiot
reggie reaches the lobby first and without hesitation races toward the front door and out
the confused hotel manager behind the desk can only stare in surprise
the elevator adam inside has not yet reached the bottom
i want those stamps
a taxi stands by the curb
reggie leaves the hotel and runs to it
indicating the direction palais royal vite
calmly the driver points to the little printed sign on his windshield reading italie
pointing the other way porte ditalie moi
mais cest tres vite
on veut me teur
shaking his head italie
she looks around and sees adam come out of the hotel and straight toward her
she turns and runs off toward the place st
as reggie comes to the corner
she stops sees the metro station st
michel and rushes to it scampering down the stairs
adam is behind her
reggie comes flying down the stairs and runs past the ticket booth fishing in her bag for her carnet booklet of tickets casting a quick look behind her
camera pans quickly to adam just coming off the stairs who runs after her
reggie gets to the gate ahead of adam and manages to crowd in front of some others about to pass through
barely stopping she holds out her ticket to the guard to be punched then heads down the platform still running
adam gets to the gate but the guard stops him as he tries to pass through
breathless i dont want to go anywhere im only trying pointing off billet monsieur
adam tries to look past him to see reggie but gives it up and goes back toward the ticket booth on the run
camera leading reggie as she runs the passageway is nearly empty
her footsteps echo against the tile and concrete walls
the jumble of advertising posters as it passes rapidly forming a moving band of letters women cartoons and colors
reggie stops and pauses for a moment at a sign indicating two different directions an arrow for each
direction pte dorleans pte de clignancourt choosing clignancourt she runs off
camera pans sharply degrees to pick up adam rounding the corner in hot pursuit
reggie starts down the platform looking behind her every few steps
suddenly she looks up in surprise there across the tracks on the opposite platform is adam
he has evidently made the wrong turn back in the passageway
they stare at each other for a moment
then the bell rings announcing the arrival of a train
adam turns running back through the exit behind him
not knowing what to do reggie looks into the darkness of the tunnel
the approaching train can be heard
to herself come on please she turns to look at the gate slowly the pneumatic door starts to close
as it does the train roars into the station
the gate can be seen slowly closing
adam runs to it tries to force it back but cannot
finally he jumps up and commando style vaults over it
reggie is just entering the red center car the two on either side are dark green
adam runs for the red car and just manages to make it as the doors shut in unison the latches falling with a concerted click and the little whistle blowing
to inform the motor man to depart
the train starts to move
the entire length of the car separates adam and reggie
for a moment their eyes meet then adam starts to weave his way past the other passengers on his way to her
suddenly he is stopped
adam turns to see a train guard
adam shows him his yellow ticket and starts past him but again the train guard stops him
vous etes dans le premier classe monsieur
heavy accent this car is for first class only you have a second class ticket
but thats what they gave me
he tries to pull away from the train guard and finds himself staring into the serious face of a gendarme
adam looks at the gendarme then at reggie
as the train pulls in and comes to a stop
the gendarme opens the door for adam and escorts him out
adam turns once more to look at reggie as he goes
she remains in the car
the gendarme gestures for adam to enter the green second class car behind the red first class one
reluctantly adam does
as adam enters and goes to the door through which he can see reggie in the car ahead
she is gone
moving quickly he returns to the exit door and looks at the platform
from adams p
she is hurrying toward an exit marked featuring adam as he hurries from the car
he finds his way blocked by five nuns in large white butterfly hats
it takes him a few precious seconds to work his way around them
reggie has entered an area leading to the exit
but as she reaches the stairway leading up to the street level she is confronted with an iron grill barring her way
she tries to open it but it is firmly padlocked
a sign hung on it reads ferme les weekends
she turns desperately looking for some way out
adam is off the train
he stands on the platform as the train doors slam shut the latches click the whistle blows and the train pulls out
he looks around in all directions looking for some sign of reggie
he spots the exit marked sortie the same one used by reggie and starts toward it
as adam enters the deserted area
there is miraculously no sign of reggie
he goes to the locked grill and tries it testing the padlock
camera pans to a phone booth solid door with a window in the upper half and we see reggies hand reaching up to dial a number
reggie sits on the floor of the booth dialing
to herself as she dials balzac
she holds the receiver to her ear
the number can be heard ringing but no one answers
she hangs up and reaches for the phone book leafing through its pages
embassies embassies adam stands for a minute looking around not knowing what to do
reggie has finished dialing her number and now pushes the button
it clicks loudly
into the phone whispering american embassy
bartholomews office please mr
bartholomews office an operator speaking into a headset
could you speak out please
i cant quite hear you
on the phone no i cant speak any louder hamilton bartholomew b as in uh bartholomew thats right and the rest as in bartholomew

she unplugs the call plugs in another one and dials quickly
there was a call for you just now mr

i dont know any mrs
lampert trapped in a metro station
who does she think i am the c
all right youd better call the french police
shot phone booth
as reggies head appears peeking cautiously over the bottom of the window
from inside the phone booth
through the glass adam can be seen leaving the sortie area
carefully reggie opens the door and comes out
she goes to the corner and looks around it
from reggies p
as adam walks away from camera down the platform
camera pans to reggie peeking around the corner
she looks the opposite way sees another exit at the other end of the platform also marked sortie
she looks back once more at adam then makes up her mind and starts running towards the exit
as the bell rings announcing the next train
he turns to look and sees reggie
he takes off running after her
as she runs adam several yards behind her
calling reggie wait
she turns into the exit
as reggie starts up the long steep flight of stone steps leading to the street level
adam appears behind her climbing two at a time and gaining
reggie why wont you listen
im through listening to you
he is rapidly closing the gap between them
it is clear that reggie is tiring
but i didnt kill anybody
then who did
youre the only one left
passersby descending the stairs stand aside to let the two strange americans pass watching in wonderment
adam is only a few steps behind now
reggie please believe me
as reggie wearily gains the top adam lunges for her
he manages to grab her foot as he falls forward but all he winds up with is a shoe which has come loose in his hand
reggie shrieks then regaining her balance continues running limping in her one shoe
adam scrambles to his feet and starts after her again
as reggie still hobbling runs through and toward the stairs leading to the street
camera pans to adam as he too runs through
he is again several yards behind her
as reggie comes up the stairs from the metro
she stops long enough to kick off her other shoe then runs across the street ignoring the traffic toward the rue de valois which forms one side of the palais
adam is gaining on her again
the smaller court at the comedie francaise end of the palais gardens separated from the larger garden by a double peristyle consisting of two twin rows these separated from each
other by a small marble court of twenty columns each in all eighty columns
the only person in sight is the man we have known as bartholomew waiting at the far end of the columns looking at his watch impatiently
then from the rue de valois side of the palais reggie runs into the court
she spots bartholomew and fishes in her bag for the stamps as she runs taking them out and waving them
bartholomew hes chasing me
adam has run into the court and now skids to a stop at the near end of the colonnade as he spots bartholomew
reggie still running is halfway between the two men
bartholomew draws his gun but cant get a shot at adam who has ducked in among the columns
thats carson dyle
this news hits reggie hard and she stops in alarm
she looks at bartholomew then back at adam who has drawn his own gun
note both bartholomew and adam are in among the stone columns at opposite ends of the colonnade keeping out of each others sight
reggie stands out in the open the stamps in her hand confused as to which man she should go to
calmly we all know carson dyle is dead mrs
its carson dyle i tell you
youre not going to believe him mrs
lampert its too fantastic
hes trying to trick you again
reggie looks at one then the other not knowing what to do
tex recognized him thats why he said dyle
if you give him those stamps hell kill you too
reggie takes a step toward adam
lampert if im who he said whats preventing me from killing you right now
reggie stops turns back to bartholomew
because hed have to come out to get the stamps he knows hed never make it
whats the matter with you mrs
are you going to believe every lie he tells you
he wants the money for himself thats all hes ever wanted
to adam explaining hes with the c
ive seen him at the embassy
dont be a fool
hes carson dyle
thats right mrs
lampert im a dead man look at me
i dont know who anybody is any more
reggie listen to me
you lied to me so many times gently reggie trust me once more please
can i really believe you this time adam
a pause theres not a reason on earth why you should
she looks toward adam for a moment then back to bartholomew then slowly starts toward adam
all right adam
stop right now mrs
lampert or ill kill you
reggie stops in alarm
it wont get you the stamps dyle youll have to come out to get them and im not likely to miss at this range
now called carson maybe not but it takes a lot of bullets to kill me
they left me there with five of them in my legs and my stomach they knew i was still alive but they left me
i spent ten months in a german camp with nothing to stop the pain and no food they were willing to take all these chances for the money but not
they deserved to die
during the following he looks around looking for some way out
but i didnt have anything to do with youve got the money
it belongs to me now
please believe me mrs
lampert ill kill you a little more blood wont matter
during this adam has moved out from behind the columns creeping cautiously across the open space between the two colonnades and finally behind the second
ill give you five to make up your mind mrs
she has seen adams move from her angle but doesnt know quite what to do
i need some time to think
one as he slowly moves along behind the second colonnade his gun ready trying to get an angle on carson
two suddenly adam stops he has caught sight of carson through the columns
but he will have a difficult shot
three four camera pans down to his gun
as his finger tightens on the trigger and the hammer moves slowly back
as he aims carefully and fires
as the bullet creases it
as the deflected bullet rips the shoulder of his coat leaving him unharmed
with carson in the b
who fires at him
adam ducks behind the column as the bullet hits it and screams off
quickly he peers back out and throws another shot
seeing carson otherwise occupied she turns and runs toward the open stage door of the comedie francaise behind her
beside the door is a poster announcing the forthcoming schedule of presentations
including carson who seeing reggie running to the door turns and fires at her
but he is too late she is safely inside
carson looks quickly back toward adam then takes off after reggie
over his shoulder we see a broken picture of carson running toward the theatre door flashing by the near and far columns
adam tries to get a shot at him but cant
finally he runs after him
as carson enters and slams the door behind him locking it
adam arriving at the door bangs on it then looks around frustrated
several yards away he sees a short stairway leading down to a door below the street level
he runs to it tries the door and enters
as carson enters the auditorium and looks around
as the camera sweeps the magnificent old theatre boxes seats stage but there is no sign of reggie
as carson walks up the aisle checking between the rows of seats
a large room lit by a single bare bulb under the stage
adam appears moving cautiously gun ready
he creeps along next to the wall looking around at all the various scenic pieces which fill the room
as carson moves carefully across the darkened stage near the footlights looking for reggie
at mid stage camera pans down to his feet only a few inches from the prompters box
inside huddling down is a terrified reggie holding her breath as she watches him
as carson moves into the opposite wings sees the light board and throws on all the switches
the stage is bathed in light
he returns to the stage
adam is looking up having heard the footsteps on the stage over his head and hearing them now
he looks around and sees a narrow curving staircase leading up
he goes to it and starting up finds a door
he tries the knob the door is locked
reggie cringing back from the bright light notices the doorknob turning
it makes a slight clicking sound
carson upstage looking behind a piece of classic scenery hears the doorknob and turns suddenly
we catch a quick glimpse of reggie as she ducks down out of sight
all right mrs
the games over
come out of there
reggie does not appear
i dont want to kill you mrs
lampert but i will adam comes down the stairs from the prompters box and looks up at the ceiling
it is divided into thirty six square sections each numbered and lettered from a to f
they are trapdoors
he looks from the ceiling to a row of levers on one wall
thirty six of them numbered and lettered to correspond to the traps
as carson takes a few steps towards the prompters box his gun ready
did you hear me mrs
reggie huddled inside
adam is listening carefully trying to figure out where carson is standing watching the ceiling
it is marked c
i wont wait much longer mrs
lampert as he turns to the levers and reaches for the one marked c
he is about to pull it
carson takes a few more steps forward
adam stops himself from pulling the lever just in time
he lets his held breath escape
he looks back at the ceiling
the one marked c
as carsons voice is heard camera moves to the next trap marked d
i know youre in there mrs
lampert he looks at the lever marked d
he is perspiring heavily
now he slowly reaches for the lever
carson is about to move closer to the prompters box when suddenly the stage under him opens and he plummets through out of sight
at the same time we hear a shot
as reggie slowly peers out
the empty stage without being able to see the open trap from this low angle
as she climbs out of the booth and seeing the open trap now runs to it looking down through it
from above over reggies head
she can see carson sprawled on the floor below face down and dead
adam stands beside the body looking up at reggie and smiling
as grandpierre and his two assistants guns drawn walk onto the stage from the wings
they go to the open trap and look down at adam
dyle you are under arrest for the murders of charles lampert herman scobie joseph penthollow leopold gideon and whoever that is down there
adam is surprised then shakes his head
reggie youd better tell him
he wouldnt dare hit a girl
as a taxi rolls by the arcades camera panning with it
reggie and adam in the rear of the cab
reggie has one of her feet in her hand shoe off rubbing it
you didnt have to chase me so hard here give it to me
he starts to take the foot but she pulls it back and offers him the other one
that ones done start on this one
he takes the foot and begins rubbing it
im sorry i thought you were the murderer adam how did i know that he was as big a liar as you are
and thats all the gratitude i get for saving your hide
the truth now was it my hide or the stamps
what a terrible thing to say
how could you even think that
all right prove it to me tell me to go to the embassy first thing in the morning and turn in those stamps
adam says nothing
i said tell me to go to the i heard you i heard you
then say it
reggie listen to me never mind ill go by myself
what makes you think theyre even interested
its only a quarter of a million itll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping
as a taxpayer as reggie and adam approach the marine in full dress uniform always on guard at the embassy
to adam whos a taxpayer
crooks dont pay taxes
excuse me soldier marine maam
whom would i see regarding the return of stolen government money
you might try the treasury department maam room second floor mr
thank you marine
featuring a door marked
reggie and adam appear
do you mind if i wait out here
the sight of all that money being given away might make me break out
a secretary sits behind a desk
she looks up as reggie enters
cruikshank please my name is lampert
the secretary picks up her phone and presses a button
cruikshank a miss mrs
lampert to see you yes sir
to reggie go right in
reggie goes to the door leading to the private office
featuring the door as reggie enters
she stops suddenly
featuring the desk
behind it sits adam now cruikshank
reggie stares at him unbelievingly then looks around confused
by way of explanation he indicates the door to the hall
blowing up well of all the mean rotten contemptible crooked crooked
i should think youd be glad to find out i wasnt crooked
you couldnt even be honest about being dishonest
why didnt you say something

bonus item lyrics to the theme song of the film music by henry mancini words by johnny mercer when we played our charade we were like children posing playing at
games acting out names guessing the parts we played
oh what a hit we made
we came on next to closing best on the bill lovers until love left the masquerade
fate seemed to pull the strings i turned and you were gone
while from the darkened wings the music box played on
sad little serenade song of my hearts composing i hear it still i always will best on the bill charade
