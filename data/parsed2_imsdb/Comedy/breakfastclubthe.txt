b if window
href b b the breakfast club written and directed by john hughes against black title card
and these children that you spit on as they try to change their worlds are immune to your consultations
theyre quite aware of what theyre going through
david bowie the blank screen and title card shatter to reveal
during brians monologue we see various views of things inside the school including benders locker
shermer high school shermer illinois
we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole saturday in detention for whatever it was that we did wrong what we did was wrong
but we think youre crazy to make us write this essay telling you who we think we are what do you care
you see us as you want to see us
in the simplest terms and the most convenient definitions
you see us as a brain an athelete a basket case a princess and a criminal
thats the way we saw each other at seven oclock this morning
we were brainwashed
we see claire and her father sitting in their car in the parking lot
claire is the prom queen and is clearly a snob
i cant believe you cant get me out of this
i mean its so absurd i have to be here on a saturday
its not like im a defective or anything
ill make it up to you
honey ditching class to go shopping doesnt make you a defective
have a good day
claire rolls her eyes and gets out of the car and walks up the school front steps we are in brians car
his mother is there and so is his little sister
he is sort of a nerd
is this the first time or the last time we do this
well get in there and use the time to your advantage
mom were not supposed to study we just have to sit there and do nothing
well mister you figure out a way to study
brian gets out of the car and walks towards the school
we see andrew and his father
andrew is clearly a jock hes wearing a lettermans jacket with lots of patches on it
hey i screwed around
guys screw around theres nothing wrong with that
except you got caught sport
yeah mom already reemed me alright
angry you wanna miss a match
you wanna blow your ride
now no schools gonna give a scholarship to a discipline case
andrew gets out of the car and walks into the school
we see john bender walking towards us
he is wearing sunglasses
a car is coming towards him but he doesnt stop walking
the car slams on its breaks directly in front of him
bender gets out of the frame
out of the car steps allison
she is dressed all in black
she steps forward to look in the cars front window and the car drives away
there are six tables in two rows of three
claire is sitting at the front table
brian comes in and sits at the table behind her
andrew comes in and points at the chair next to claire at the front table
she shrugs and he sits there
in walks bender he touches everything on the checkout desk and takes a few things in the process
he walks over to where brian is sitting and points to the table on the opposite side of the library
brian reluctantly gets up and moves
bender sits at the table where brian was and puts his feet up
allison walks in
she walks all the way around the library and sits in the back corner table just behind brian
andrew and claire look at each other and snicker
brian looks at her in confusion and then turns away
enter richard vernon a teacher
he holds a stack of papers in his left hand
he addresses the group with such disrespect it makes you wonder how he ever got the job
here we are
i want to congradulate you for being on time
claire raises her hand
excuse me sir
i think theres been a mistake
i know its detention but
i dont think i belong in here
vernon doesnt care
he just continues to talk
it is now seven oh six
you have exactly eight hours and fifty four minutes to think about why youre here
to ponder the error of your ways
bender spits into the air and catches the spit in his mouth again
claire looks like she is going to gag
and you may not talk
you will not move from these seats
he glances up at bender and points at him
vernon pulls the chair out from under benders feet
will not sleep
alright people were gonna try something a little different today
we are going to write an essay of no less than a thousand words describing to me who you think you are
is this a test
vernon passes out paper and pencils and takes no notice of bender
and when i say essay
i mean essay
i do not mean a single word repeated a thousand times
is that clear mr
bender looks up
maybe youll learn a little something about yourself
maybe youll even decide whether or not you care to return
brian raises his hand and then stands
you know i can answer that right now sir
thatd be no no for me
sit down johnson
thank you sir
is right across that hall
any monkey business is ill advised
he looks around at them
i got a question
vernon looks at him suspiciously
does barry manilow know you raid his wardrobe
ill give you the answer to that question mr
bender next saturday
dont mess with the bull young man youll get the horns
is a brownie hound
everyone tries to get comfortable and we hear a loud snapping sound
brian turns and looks and it is allison biting her nails
benders eyes widen as he turns to look
everyone is looking now
allison notices them looking at her
you keep eating your hand and youre not gonna be hungry for lunch
allison spits part of her nail at bender
ive seen you before you know
we see vernon look out from his office
we see brian playing with his pen
quietly to himself who do i think i am
who are you
who are you
he attaches the pen to his bottom lip and puts the top under his upper lip
i am a walrus
bender looks at him in utter confusion
brian notices this laughs and takes the pen out of his mouth embarrassed
bender and brian begin to take their jackets off at the same time
they both notice this
brian stops removing his jacket
bender takes his all the way off
brian rubs his hands together and pretends to be cold
he pulls his jacket back on
he turns and looks at bender who is still staring at him
its the shits huh
bender glares at him and brian utters an uncomfortable laugh
bender turns away and crumples up his essay paper
he throws it at claire
it misses and goes over claires head
andrew and claire acknowlege it but continue to ignore bender
bender starts loudly singing the musical part of a song
nah nah nah nah nah nah
nah nah nah
to herself i cant believe this is really happening to me
bender stops singing abruptly
whatre we sposed to do if we hafta take a piss
if you gotta go
we hear bender unzip his fly
you gotta go
everyone is now looking at bender
disgusted oh my god
hey yer not urinating in here man
it makes it crawl back up
you whip it out and youre dead before the first drop hits the floor
bender gasps mockingly
youre pretty sexy when you get angry
he turns to brian
brian points at himself with his pen
why dont you go close that door
well get the prom queen impregnated
claire turns and glares at him
bender ignores him
if i lose my temper youre totalled man
to bender why dont you just shut up
nobody here is interested
to claire about bender buttface
well hey sporto
whatd you do to get in here
forget to wash your jock
nervous uh excuse me fellas
i think we should just write our papers
to bender look just because you live in here doesnt give you the right to be a pain in the ass
so knock it off
bender mockingly registers pain in his face
its a free country
to andrew hes just doing it to get a rise out of you
just ignore him
to claire sweets
you couldnt ignore me if you tried
claire rolls her eyes
to andrew and claire are you guys like boyfriend girl friend
a beat steady dates
another beat lo vers
another beat come on sporto level with me
do you slip her the hot
claire and andrew turn to face bender both furious
screams go to hell
we see vernon in his office
whats going on in there
to himself smug little pricks
they all look at each other
andrew turns away from bender
to himself scumbag
bender stands up and walks over to the railing
he sits on it
what do you say we close that door
we cant have any kind of party with vernon checking us out every few seconds
well you know the doors sposed to stay open
so why dont you just shut up
theres four other people in here you know
god you can count
i knew you had to be smart to be a
who the hell are you to judge anybody anyway
you know bender
you dont even count
i mean if you disappeared forever it wouldnt make any difference
you may as well not even exist at this school
bender probably is upset at this and he pauses a moment before speaking
he doesnt let his emotions out however
ill just run right out and join the wrestling team
andrew and claire look at each other and laugh at bender
to claire maybe the prep club too
no they wouldnt take you
you know why guys like you knock everything
to himself oh this should be stunning
its cause youre afraid
with mock enthusiasm oh god
you ritchies are so smart thats exactly why im not heavy in activities
youre a big coward
brian feels left out
to no one imparticular im in the math club
see youre afraid that they wont take you
you dont belong so you just have to dump all over it
it wouldnt have anything to do with you activities people being assholes
now would it
well you wouldnt know
you dont even know any of us
well i dont know any lepers either but im not gonna run out and join one of their fucking clubs
hey lets watch the mouth huh
brian again feels he needs to contribute
im in the physics club too
to claire scuse me a sec
to brian what are you babbling about
well what i said was
im in the math club the latin club and the physics club
bender nods and turns to claire
do you belong to the physics club
thats an academic club
academic clubs arent the same as other kinds of clubs
oh but to dorks like him
bender points at brian
to brian what do you guys do in your club
in physics um we ah we talk about physics
about properties of physics
so its sorta social
demented and sad but social
yeah well i guess you could consider it a social situation
i mean there are other children in my club and uh at the end of the year we have um you know a big banquet at the uh at the
you load up you party
well no we get dressed up
i mean but we dont
we dont get high
to bender only burners like you get high
and uh i didnt have any shoes
so i had to borrow my dads
it was kinda weird cause my mom doesnt like me to wear other peoples shoes
and uh my cousin kent
my cousin kendall from uh indiana
he got high once and you know he started eating like really weird foods
and uh and then he just felt like he didnt belong anywhere
you know kinda like you know twilight zone kinda
laughs to bender sounds like you
look you guys keep up your talking and vernons gonna come right in here
i got a meet this saturday and im not gonna miss it on account of you boneheads
to andrew oh and wouldnt that be a bite
bender lets out a moan of fake agony
missing a whole wrestling meet
well you wouldnt know anything about it faggot
you never competed in your whole life
with mock hurt oh i know
i feel all empty inside because of it
i have such a deep admiration for guys that roll around on the floor with other guys
youd never miss it
you dont have any goals
oh but i do
i wanna be just like you
i figure all i needs a labotamy and some tights
brian becomes interested
you wear tights
to brian no i dont wear tights i wear the required uniform
defensive shut up
they hear vernon moving around out in the hall so bender quickly comes and sits in the chair between claire and andrew
he folds his hands on the table
vernon goes back into his office
bender laughs and gets up
he starts walking towards the double doors that separate the library from the hallway
you know theres not sposed to be any monkey business
bender turns and points at brian
in a stern voice young man
have you finished your paper
bender turns back away and goes to the door
he looks around cautiously and removes a screw from the door
what are you gonna do
drop dead i hope
we see vernon getting a drink at the fountain
he stands up and checks the way he looks in a mirror
he does a muscular pose and utters some manly jibberish cobadonga
brian looks up
bender is messing with the door to the library
bender thats thats school property there
you know it doesnt belong to us
its something not to be toyed with
the door slams shut
bender runs back to his seat
thats very funny come on fix it
you should really fix that
am i a genius
no youre an asshole
what a funny guy
fix the door bender
everyone just shhh
we see vernon walking back to his office
he stops and listens to them through the closed door
ive been here before i know what im doing
fix the door get up there and fix it
screams shut up
we see brian as we hear vernon in the hall
he opens the door and storms in
why is that door closed
for a few seconds no one says anything they just stare at vernon
why is that door closed
howre we sposed to know
were not sposed to move right
vernon turns to claire
we were just sitting here like we were sposed to
vernon looks around and looks at bender
who closed that door
i think a screw fell out of it
it just closed sir
vernon looks at allison in the back
allison lets out a squeak and slams her face onto the table hiding in her jacket hood
she doesnt talk sir
to bender give me that screw
i dont have it
you want me to yank you outta that seat and shake it out of you
i dont have it
screws fall out all of the time the worlds an imperfect place
give it to me bender
excuse me sir why would anybody want to steal a screw
to claire watch it young lady
vernon goes over to the door
he tries to hold it open by putting a folding chair in front of it
the doors way too heavy sir
the door slams shut despite the chair
vernon opens the door again
he comes back in
pointing andrew clark
get up here
come on front and center lets go
andrew gets up and walks over to vernon
hey how come andrew gets to get up
if he gets up well all get up itll be anarchy
vernon and andrew are now attempting to move the steel magazine rack in front of the door
okay now watch the magazines
its out of my hands
they get it into the doorway and it blocks the entire door
thats very clever sir but what if theres a fire
i think violating fire codes and endangering the lives of children would be unwise at this juncture in your career sir
vernon thinks about it
he turns to andrew
alright what are you doing with this
get this outta here for gods sake
whats the matter with you
you know the school comes equipped with fire exits at either end of the library
brian points at them and bender glares at him
to brian show dick some respect
andrew and vernon come back into the main section of the library
to andrew lets go
get back into your seat
to andrew i expected a little more from a varsity letterman
to bender youre not fooling anybody bender
the next screw that falls out is gonna be you
vernon turns to leave
under his breath eat my shorts
vernon spins in his tracks and faces bender again
what was that
loudly eat my shorts
you just bought yourself another saturday mister
you just bought one more right there
well im free the saturday after that
beyond that im gonna have to check my calendar
cause its gonna be filled well keep goin
you want another one

im doing society a favor
thats another one right now
ive got you for the rest of your natural born life if you dont watch your step
you want another one

you got another one right there
thats another one pal
worried cut it out
claire mouths the word stop to bender

bender glares at him
how many is that
thats seven including the one when we first came in and you asked mr
vernon here whether barry manilow knew that he raided his closet
to bender now its eight
to brian you stay out of it
excuse me sir its seven
shut up peewee
to bender youre mine bender
for two months i gotcha
what can i say
oh im sure thats exactly what you want these people to believe

you ought to spend a little more time trying to do something with yourself and a little less time trying to impress people
you might be better off
to everyone alright thats it
im going to be right outside those doors
the next time i hafta come in here
im cracking skulls
bender mouths im cracking skulls vernon leaves and closes the door
a musical riff builds to a climax as bender screams
screams fuck you
we see the clock it reads a quarter to eight
we see bender lighting his shoe on fire and lighting a cigarette with his shoe
we see claire thinking
we see brian playing with his balls
we see andrew playing with his sweatshirt
we see allison pulling a string around her finger and making it turn purple
we see bender put the flames on his shoe out
he then plays air guitar
we see allison drawing
we see andrew playing paper football
he cheers silently
allison shakes dandruff from her hair onto her picture
we see everyone fall asleep
vernon is standing there staring at the sleeping kids
who has to go to the lavatory
everyone raises their hands
we see the clock it now says
we see andrew stretching
we see bender tearing pages out of a book
he is tossing them around
thats real intelligent
its wrong to destroy literature
he continues to tear pages out
its such fun to read
and molet really pumps my nads
pronouncing it correctly mol yare
i love his work
bender tosses the rest of the pages at brian
he picks up the card catalogue drawer and begins to take cards out
nothing to do when youre locked in a vacancy
speak for yourself
do you think id speak for you
i dont even know your language
andrew turns to claire
hey you grounded tonight
i dont know my mom said i was but by dad told me to just blow her off
big party at stubbies parents are in europe
should be pretty wild
yeah can you go
i doubt it
well cause if i do what my mother tells me not to do its because because my father says its okay
theres like this whole big monster deal its endless and its a total drag
its like any minute
who do you like better
you like your old man better than your mom
theyre both strict
no i mean if you had to choose between them
i dunno id probably go live with my brother
i mean i dont think either one of them gives a shit about me
its like they use me just to get back at each other
suddenly from the back of the room
everyone looks at her shocked
allison blows her hair out of her eyes and grins
youre just feeling sorry for yourself
yeah well if i didnt nobody else would
youre breaking my heart
bender jumps down and goes next to andrew
you get along with your parents
well if i say yes im an idiot right
youre an idiot anyway
but if you say you get along with your parents well youre a liar too
bender turns and walks away from him
andrew follows and pushes bender
you know something man
if we werent in school right now id waste you
bender points his middle finger at the floor
can you hear this
want me to turn it up
bender flips his hand around so he is now giving andrew the bird
brian comes over and puts a hand on each of the guys shoulders
hey fellas i mean
andrew pushes away from brian
i dont like my parents either i dont
i dont get along with them
their idea of parental compassion is just you know wacko
bender turns to brian
you are a parents wet dream okay
bender starts to walk away
well thats a problem
look i can see you getting all bunged up for them making you wear these kinda clothes
but face it youre a neo maxi zoom dweebie
what would you be doing if you werent out making yourself a better citizen
why do you have to insult everybody
im being honest asshole
i would expect you
to know the difference
yeah well hes gotta name
yeah to brian whats your name
to brian my condolences
bender walks away
to bender whats your name
its a family name
its a fat girls name
well thank you
im not fat
well not at present but i could see you really pushing maximum density
you see im not sure if you know this
but there are two kinds of fat people
theres fat people that were born to be fat and then theres fat people that were once thin but they became fat
so when you look at them you can sorta see that thin person inside
you see youre gonna get married youre gonna squeeze out a few puppies and then uh
he mimes becoming fat making noises
claire gives him the finger
obscene finger gestures from such a pristine girl
resentfully im not that pristine
bender bends down closer to claire
are you a virgin
a beat ill bet you a million dollars that you are
lets end the suspense
is it gonna be
another beat a white weddin
why dont you just shut up
have you ever kissed a boy on the mouth
a beat have you ever been felt up
over the bra under the blouse shoes off
hoping to god your parents dont walk in
claire is getting upset
do you want me to puke
over the panties no bra blouse unbuttoned calvins in a ball on the front seat past eleven on a school night
leave her alone
bender slowly stands and faces andrew
i said leave her alone
you gonna make me
bender walks over to where andrew is standing
you and how many of your friends
just me just you and me
me hitting you you hitting the floor
anytime youre ready pal
bender goes to hit him but andrew gets bender down on the ground with a wrestling move
i dont wanna get into to this with you man
andrew gets up
bender gets up
cause id kill you
its real simple
id kill you and your fucking parents would sue me and it would be a big mess and i dont care enough about you to bother
andrew turns and walks away
bender takes out a switchblade and opens it
he stabs the switchblade into a chair
lets end this right now
you dont talk to her
you dont look at her and you dont even think about her
you understand me
im trying to help her
we see the janitor carl come into the room
brian how you doing
your dad works here
brian is embarrassed
can i ask you a question
how does one become a janitor
you wanna be a janitor
no i just wanna know how one becomes a janitor because andrew here is very interested in persuing a career in the custodial arts
you guys think im just some untouchable peasant
maybe so but following a broom around after shitheads like you for the past eight years ive learned a couple of things
i look through your letters i look through your lockers
i listen to your conversations you dont know that but i do
i am the eyes and ears of this institution my friends
by the way that clocks twenty minutes fast
the clock says
vernon gets up and leaves
bender starts to whistle a marching tune and everybody joins in
bender begins to whistle beethovens th
allright girls thats thirty minutes for lunch
well i think the cafeteria would be a more suitable place for us to eat lunch in sir
well i dont care what you think andrew
excuse me rich
will milk be made available to us
were extremely thirsty sir
i have a very low tolerance for dehydration
ive seen her dehydrate sir its pretty gross
relax ill get it
ah ah ah grab some wood there bub
what do you think i was born yesterday
you think im gonna have you roaming these halls
he points at andrew
he points at allison
whats her name
wake her up
to allison come on on your feet missy
this is no rest home
allison gets up
theres a soft drink machine in the teachers lounge
andrew and allison are walking in the hall
so whats your poison
allison doesnt answer
what do you drink
allison still doesnt answer
forget i asked
allison waits for two beats and then speaks
when do you drink vodka
is that why youre here today
allison doesnt answer
why are you here
allison snaps back
why are you here
they stop walking and andrew leans against the wall
um im here today
because uh because my coach and my father dont want me to blow my ride
see i get treated differently because uh coach thinks im a winner
so does my old man
im not a winner because i wanna be one
im a winner because i got strength and speed
kinda like a race horse
thats about how involved i am in whats happening to me
thats very interesting
now why dont you tell me why youre really in here
claire and bender and brian are all sitting around waiting for the cokes
you wanna see a picture of a guy with elephantitus of the nuts
its pretty tasty
no thank you
how do you think he rides a bike
claire rolls her eyes and turns away in disgust
would you ever consider dating a guy like this
cant you just leave me alone
i mean if he had a great personality and was a good dancer and had a cool car
although youd probably have to ride in the back seat cause his nuts would ride shotgun
you know what i wish i was doing
op watch what you say brian here is a cherry
i wish i was on a plane to france
im not a cherry
to brian when have you ever gotten laid
ive laid lotsa times
she lives in canada met her at niagra falls

brian shushes bender and points at claire whos back is still turned
oh you and claire did it
claire spins around

to claire nothin nothin
to bender lets just drop it well talk about it later
drop what whatre you talking about
well brians trying to tell me that in addition to the number of girls in the niagra falls area that presently you and he are riding the hobby horse

john said i was a cherry and i said i wasnt thats it thats all that was said
well then what were you motioning to claire for
you know i dont appreciate this very much brian
he is lying
oh you werent motioning to claire
you know hes lying right
were you or were you not motioning to claire
yeah but it was only
was only because i didnt want her to know that i was a virgin okay
bender just stares at him
excuse me for being a virgin im sorry
why didnt you want me to know you were a virgin
because its personal business its my personal private business
well brian it doesnt sound like youre doing any business
i think its okay for a guy to be a virgin
bender looks suprised
claire smiles and nods
everybody has lunches now
claire begins to take hers out of a small shopping bag
whats in there
guess wheres your lunch
youre wearing it
bender grabs a coke and tosses it over to allison who catches it without even looking up
bender then watches claire set up a sushi platter
rice uh raw fish and seaweed
you wont accept a guys tongue in your mouth and youre gonna eat that
can i eat
i dont know
give it a try
we now watch andrew take a couple sandwiches out of his bag a bag of potato chips an apple a banana a bag of cookies and a carton of milk
allison opens her coke and it fizzes over
she loudly slurps it up off the table and her fingers
andrew sees bender looking at him
whats your problem
allison opens her sandwich and and tosses the meat up
it lands on the sculpture above
she opens some pixie stix and pours the sugar on the sandwich and then puts capn crunch on top of that
she crushes the sandwich together and loudly eats it
bender goes over and sits by brian bender takes brians bag lunch
whatre we having
uh its your standard regular lunch i guess
bender reaches in the bag and pulls out a thermos
he sets it on the table and points at it
bender goes in again and pulls out a juice box
brian reaches toward the bag and bender slaps his hand
thats apple juice
i can read
pb j with the crusts cut off
well brian this is a very nutritous lunch all the food groups are represented

andrew and claire smile at each other

bender mimes mother kissing father and then father kissing mother and then father punching mother in the face
suddenly its not so funny anymore
alright what about your family

bender stands again and points forward
as his father stupid worthless no good god damned freeloading son of a bitch retarded bigmouth know it all asshole jerk

bender slams his hand back to slap his invisable mother
as his father shut up bitch

bender actually looks hurt

bender comes over to andrew and rolls up his right sleeve to reveal a circular shaped burn
do you believe this
its about the size of a cigar
do i stutter
you see this is what you get in my house when you spill paint in the garage
bender begins to walk away
see i dont think that i need to sit here with you fuckin dildos anymore
bender walks over to a map table and throws all the maps on the floor
he climbs up on top of the table and then up to the second floor balcony
to andrew you shouldnt have said that
how would i know i mean he lies about everything anyway
vernon puts an orange in his mouth and then attempts to pour coffee out of his thermos
the top comes off and the coffee goes all over his desk
vernon walks into the hallway talking to himself
looks like they scrape it off the bottom of the mississippi river
everythings polluted everythings polluted
bender comes out of the library doors followed bye veryone else
bender and claire are walking next to each other
brian and andrew are walking next to each other and at the end of the line allison is following
to bender how do you know where vernon went
well then how do you know when hell be back
being bad feels pretty good huh
to andrew whats the point in going to benders locker
this is so stupid
why do you think why are we risking getting caught

bender opens his locker
my maids on vacation
bender pulls out a bag of marijuana
screw that bender

bender walks away
the boy had marijuana
claire walks after bender
that was marijuana
andrew follows the other two
brian looks at allison who is standing there with her mouth open
do you approve of this
brian turns and leaves
allison steals the lock off of benders locker
we see the crowd walking down the hall
well cross through the lab and then well double back
you better be right if vernon cuts us off its your fault asshole
to claire whatd he say

bender puts his bag of marijuana into brians underwear
bender runs away singing loudly

vernon grabs benders shoulder
hey keep your fuckin hands off me
i expect better manners from you dick
bender takes his sunglasses out of his pocket and lays them in front of andrew
for better hallway vision
bender leaves but not before pushing stuff over on the way
vernon has put bender in a closet and is in there talking to him
thats the last time bender
thats the last time you ever make me look bad in front of those kids do you hear me

bender just sits there staring at vernon
vernon fakes a punch and bender flinches
thats what i though
youre a gutless turd
vernon leaves and locks the closet door after him
bender climbs into a hatch in the ceiling and disappears
bender is slowly crawling through a heating duct
to himself a naked blond walks into a bar with a poodle under one arm and a two foot salami under the other
she lays the poodle on the table
bar tender says i suppose you wont be needing a drink
the naked lady says
the ceiling under bender gives and he falls through
screaming oh shit
we see the door to the bathroom
we hear vernon inside
jesus christ allmighty
bender walks down the stairs
i forgot my pencil
we hear vernon in the hall
what in gods name is going on in here
what was that ruckus
uh what ruckus
i was just in my office and i heard a ruckus
could you describe the ruckus sir
watch your tongue young man watch it
we see bender under the table by claires legs
he sits up and bangs his head on the table
above the table andrew and claire try to take credit for the noise by making more noise
what is that
what what is that what is that noise
under the table bender looks between claires legs and can see her panties
he puts his head between claires legs
really sir there wasnt any noise
she squeezes benders head between her knees
everyone starts faking a coughing fit
flustered that noise
was that the noise you were talking about
no it wasnt
that was not the noise i was talking about
now i may not have caught you in the act this time but you can bet i will
allison laughs at vernon
you make book on that missy
to claire and you
i will not be made a fool of
he turns and walks away
we see that he still has the toilet seat cover stuck to his pants
everyone laughs except claire who lets bender out to a barage of slaps
it was an accident
youre an asshole
so sue me
bender gets up and walks over to brian
kybo mein doobage
brian gives bender his bag of marajuana
bender turns and walks away
youre not gonna blaze up in here
claire gets up and goes after him
we see vernon go down the stairs
brian bender and claire are sitting in a circle and laughing hysterically
bender lights claire up and she coughs the smoke out
brian laughs at her
he exhales and tries to eat the smoke
he talks in a really weird voice
chicks cannot hold der smoke
thats what it is
do you know how popular i am
im so popular everybody loves me so much at this school
brian waves claire over to him and he falls over
we see andrew emerge from a really smokey room
he inhales another puff and then starts dancing to everybodys applause
he goes back in the room he was in
he screams and it shatters the glass in the door
vernon is glancing through the confidential files in the school basement
to himself mister oh mister tearney
a history of slight mental illness
wooh no wonder hes so fucked up
hey carl how you doin
good whats up
not much whats happening what are you doing in the basement files
oh nothin nothin here
im just doin a little homework here
carl laughing comes over and looks at the files that vernon was looking at
this is a highly sensitive area and i i tell you something
certain people would be very very embarrassed
i would really appreciate it if if if if this would be something that that you and i could keep between us
whatre you gonna do for me man
well well what would you like
got fifty bucks
we see andrew and brian laughing
allison is hanging out over by the statue in the back of the library
no no man no you got a middle name
allison suddenly takes interest in the conversation and as she speaks she moves over and sits next to the two
your middle name is ralph as in puke
brian and andrew look at her in confusion
your birthday is march th youre five nine and a half you weigh a hundred and thirty pounds and your social security number is a beat
andrew is impressed
are you psychic
well would you mind telling me how you know all this about me
allison reaches in her bag
i stole your wallet
she produces it in her hands and grins
give it to me
allison reluctantly hands over the wallet and brian glances through it to make sure nothing is missing
this is great
youre a thief too
im not a thief
whats there to steal
two bucks and a beaver shot
hes got a nudie picture in there
i saw it its perverted
alright lets see it
we see bender he is brushing his teeth with one of claires cosmetic brushes
we see claire looking through benders wallet pictures
are all these your girlfriends
some of them
what about the others
well some i consider my girlfriends and some
i just consider
whether or not i wanna hang out with them
you dont believe in just one guy one girl
thats the way it should be
well not for me
bender clearly doesnt want to answer that
he acts defensive
how come you got so much shit in your purse
how come you got so many girlfriends
i asked you first
shrugs i dunno
i guess i never throw anything away
neither do i
we cut back to where andrew brian and allison are sitting andrew is looking through brians wallet
this is the worst fake id ive ever seen
do you realize you made yourself sixty eight
oh i know
i know i goofed it
what do you need a fake id for
like its obvious so i can vote
allison looks up suddenly
you wanna see whats in my bag
allison looks hurt and then resentful
just to spite them she dumps the contents of her bag onto the couch
lots of stuff comes out
what is all that stuff
do you always carry this much shit in your bag
i always carry this much shit in my bag
you never know when you may have to jam
are you gonna be like a shopping bag lady
you know like sit in alleyways and like talk to buildings and wear mens shoes and that kinda thing
ill do what i have to do
why do you have to do anything
with feeling my home life is un
so youre saying youd subject yourself to the violent dangers of the chicago streets because your homelife is unsatisfying
i dont have to run away and live in the street
i can run away and go to the ocean i can go to the country i can go to the mountains
i can go to israel africa afghanistan
brian looks at her and then moves over to andrew
you wanna get in on this
allison here says she wants to run away because her home life is unsatisfying
well everyones home lives are un satisfying
if it wasnt people would live with there parents forever
yeah yeah i understand
but i think that hers goes beyond you know what guys like you and me
consider normal unsatisfying
forget it everythings cool
allison starts putting everything back in her purse
whats the deal
theres no deal sporto
forget it leave me alone
wait a minute now youre carrying all that crap around in your purse
either you really wanna run away or you want people to think you wanna run away
allison gets up and walks away
the girl is an island with herself
andrew gets up and goes after her
hi you wanna talk
where do you want me to go
andrew turns away and allison starts to cry
you have problems
oh i have problems
you do everything everybody ever tells you to do that is a problem
but i didnt dump my purse out on the couch and invite people into my problems
so whats wrong
what is it
is is bad
allison is silently crying
what do they do to you
they ignore me
they both are crying silently
vernon and carl are sitting talking
what did you want to be when you were young
when i was a kid i wanted to be john lennon
carl dont be a goof
im trying to make a serious point here
ive been teaching for twenty two years and each year
these kids get more and more arrogant
aw bull shit man
come on vern the kids havent changed you have
you took a teaching position cause you thought itd be fun right
thought you could have summer vacations off
and then you found out it was actually work
and that really bummed you out
these kids turned on me
they think im a big fuckin joke
listen vern if you were sixteen what would you think of you huh
carl you think i give one rats ass what these kids think of me
yes i do
you think about this
when you get old these kids when i get old theyre gonna be runnin the country
now this is the thought that wakes me up in the middle of the night
that when i get older these kids are gonna take care of me
i wouldnt count on it
vernon ponders that statement for a moment
they are sitting on the floor in a circle
what would i do for a million bucks
well i guess id do as little as i had to
well howm i sposed to answer
the idea is to like search your mind for the absolute limit
like uh would you drive to school naked
would i have to get out of the car
in the spring or winter
it doesnt matter
in front of the school or in back of the school
id do that
they all look at her
ill do anything sexual i dont need a million dollars to do it either
i already have
ive done just about everything there is except a few things that are illegal
im a nymphomaniac
claire rolls her eyes
are your parents aware of this
the only person i told was my shrink
and whatd he do when you told him
he nailed me
i dont think that from a legal standpoint what he did can be construed as rape since i paid him
hes an adult
allison is relishing this attention
hes married too
claire notes her disgust
do you have any idea how completely gross that is
well the first few times
first few times
you mean he did it more than once
are you crazy
obviously shes crazy if shes screwing her shrink
to claire have you ever done it
i dont even have a psychiatrist
have you ever done it with a normal person
now didnt we already cover this
you never answered the question
look im not gonna discuss my private life with total strangers
its kind of a double edged sword isnt it
well if you say you havent
youre a prude
if you say you have
youre a slut
its a trap
you want to but you cant but when you do you wish you didnt right
or are you a tease
shes a tease
oh why dont you just forget it
youre a tease and you know it all girls are teases
to andrew shes only a tease if what she does gets you hot
i dont do anything
thats why youre a tease
okay lemme ask you a few questions
allison is suddenly defensive
ive already told you everything
doesnt it bother you to sleep around without being in love
i mean dont you want any respect
i dont screw to get respect
thats the difference between you and me
not the only difference i hope
face it youre a tease
im not a tease
sure you are
you said it yourself sex is a weapon you use it to get respect
no i never said that she twisted my words around
oh then what do you use it for
i dont use it period
claire is on the verge of tears
oh are you medically frigid or is it psychological
i didnt mean it that way
you guys are putting words into my mouth
well if youd just answer the question
why dont you just answer the question
no big deal
yeah answer it
answer the question claire
talk to us
come on answer the question
its easy its only one question
claire silences all of them by screaming
i never did it
silence for two beats
i never did it either im not a nymphomaniac
im a compulsive liar
you are such a bitch
you did that on purpose just to fuck me over
i would do it though
if you love someone its okay
i cant believe you youre so weird
you dont say anything all day and then when you open your mouth
you unload all these tremendous lies all over me
youre just pissed off because she got you to admit something you didnt want to admit to
okay fine but that doesnt make it any less bizarre
i mean were all pretty bizarre
some of us are just better at hiding it thats all
to andrew how are you bizarre
allison decides to field that question
he cant think for himself
do you guys know what uh what i did to get in here
i taped larry lesters buns together
to andrew that was you
to brian yeah you know him
yeah i know him
well then you know how hairy he is right
well when they pulled the tape off most of his hair came off and some some skin too
oh my god
and the bizarre thing is is that i did it for my old man
i tortured this poor kid because i wanted him to think that i was cool
hes always going off about you know when he was in school
all the wild things he used to do
and i got the feeling that he was disappointed that i never cut loose on anyone right
im sitting in the locker room and im taping up my knee
and larrys undressing a couple lockers down from me
hes kinda skinny weak
and i started thinking about my father and his attitude about weakness
and the next thing i knew i uh i jumped on top of him and started wailing on him
and my friends they just laughed and cheered me on
and afterwards when i was sittin in vernons office all i could think about was larrys father
and larry havin to go home and
and explain what happened to him
and the humiliation
fucking humiliation he mustuv felt
it mustuv been unreal
i mean hes crying i mean how do you apologize for something like that
theres no way
its all because of me and my old man
oh god i fucking hate him
hes like this
hes like this mindless machine that i cant even relate to anymore
andrew youve got to be number one
i wont tolerate any losers in this family
your intensity is for shit
you son of a bitch
you know sometimes i wish my knee would give
and i wouldnt be able to wrestle anymore
and he could forget all about me
i think your old man and my old man should get together and go bowling
andrew laughs briefly
its like me you know with my grades
like when i when i step outside myself kinda and when i when i look in at myself you know
and i see me and i dont like what i see i really dont
whats wrong with you
why dont you like yourself
cause im stupid
cause im failing shop
see we had this assignment to make this ceramic elephant and um
and we had eight weeks to do it and were sposed ta and it was like a lamp and when you pull the trunk the light was sposed to go
my light didnt go on i got a f on it
never got a f in my life
when i signed up you know for the course i mean
i thought i was playing it real smart you know
cause i thought ill take shop itll be such an easy way to maintain my grade point average
whyd you think itd be easy
have you seen some of the dopes that take shop
i take shop
you must be a fuckin idiot
im a fuckin idiot because i cant make a lamp
no youre a genius because you cant make a lamp
what do you know about trigonometry
i could care less about trigonometry
bender did you know without trigonometry thered be no engineering
without lamps thered be no light
okay so neither one of you is any better than the other one
allison feels left out
i can write with my toes
i can also eat brush my teeth
with your feet
play heart soul on the piano
i can make spaghetti
to andrew what can you do
tape all your buns together
i wanna see what claire can do
i cant do anything
now everybody can do something
theres one thing i can do no forget it its way too embarrassing
you ever seen wild kingdom
i mean that guys been doing that show for thirty years
okay but you have to swear to god you wont laugh
i cant believe im actually doing this
claire takes lipstick out and opens it
she places it between her breasts and applies it from her cleavage
when she lifts her head her lipstick is perfect
benders clap is sarcastic and slow
all right great
whered you learn to do that
camp seventh grade
that was great claire
my image of you is totally blown
youre a shit
dont do that to her you swore to god you wouldnt laugh
am i laughing
you fucking prick
bender turns to andrew
as he speaks we can see his words hitting home
what do you care what i think anyway
i dont even count right
i could disappear forever and it wouldnt make any difference
i may as well not even exist at this school remember
he turns to claire and you
dont like me anyway
you know i have just as many feelings as you do and it hurts just as much when somebody steps all over them
god youre so pathetic
furious dont you ever
compare yourself to me
you got everything and i got shit
fuckin rapunzel right
school would probably fucking shut down if you didnt show up
queenie isnt here
i like those earrings claire
quietly shut up
are those real diamonds claire
angry shut up
i bet they are
did you work for the money shut
for those earrings
or did your daddy buy those
furious shut up
claire starts crying
i bet he bought those for you
i bet those are a christmas gift
you know what i got for christmas this year
it was a banner fuckin year at the old bender family
i got a carton of cigarettes
the old man grabbed me and said hey
smoke up johnny
okay so go homen cry to your daddy dont cry here okay
there are a few beats
my god are we gonna be like our parents
its unavoidable it just happens
when you grow up your heart dies
allison is on the verge of tears herself
um i was just thinking i mean
i know its kind of a weird time but i was just wondering um what is gonna happen to us on monday
when were all together again
i mean i consider you guys my friends im not wrong am i
so so on monday
are we still friends you mean
if were friends now that is
do you want the truth
yeah i want the truth
i dont think so
well do you mean all of us or just john
with all of you
thats a real nice attitude claire
oh be honest andy
if brian came walking up to you in the hall on monday what would you do
i mean picture this youre there with all the sports
i know exactly what youd do youd say hi to him and when he left youd cut him all up so your friends wouldnt think you really liked him
kay what if i came up to you
same exact thing
furious and screaming at claire you are a bitch
cause im telling the truth that makes me a bitch
cause you know how shitty that is to do to someone
and you dont got the balls to stand up to your friends and tell em that youre gonna like who you wanna like
okay what about you you hypocrite
why dont you take allison to one of your heavy metal vomit parties
or take brian out to the parking lot at lunch to get high
what about andy for that matter what about me
what would your friends say if we were walking down the hall together
theyd laugh their asses off and youd probably tell them you were doing it with me so theyd forgive you for being seen with me
furious once again dont you ever talk about my friends
you dont know any of my friends you dont look at any of my friends and you certainly wouldnt condescend to speak to any of my friends so you just
stick to the things you know shopping nail polish your fathers bmw and your poor rich drunk mother in the carribean
furious and sobbing shut up
and as far as being concerned about whats gonna happen when you and i walk down the hallways at school you can forget it
cause its never gonna happen
just bury your head in the sand
and wait for your fuckin prom
i hate you
there is silence until brian speaks
then i assume allison and i are better people than you guys huh
to allison do you would you do that to me
i dont have any friends
well if you did
i dont think the kind of friends id have would mind
i just wanna tell each of you that i wouldnt do that
i wouldnt and i will not
cause i think thats real shitty
your friends wouldnt mind because they look up to us
brian laughs at her
youre so conceited claire
youre so conceited
youre so like full of yourself why are you like that
crying again im not saying that to be conceited
i hate it
i hate having to go along with everything my friends say
well then why do you do it
i dont know i dont
you dont understand
youre not friends with the same kind of people that andy and i are friends with
you know you just dont understand the pressure that they can put on you
brian is shocked
i dont understand what
you think i dont understand pressure claire
well fuck you
brian hides his head in his arm because he is crying
know why im here today
im here because mr
ryan found a gun in the locker
whyd you have a gun in your locker
you pull the fuckin trunk on it and the lights sposed to go on
and it didnt go on i mean whats the gun for brian
just forget it
you brought it up man
i cant have an f i cant have it and i know my parents cant have it
even if i aced the rest of the semester im still only a b
and everythings ruined for me
with pity oh brian
brian bashes a chair over
so i considered my options you know
killing yourself is not an option
well i didnt do it did i
no i dont think so
it was a hand gun
no it was a flare gun went off in my locker
andrew starts to laugh
its not funny
they all start to laugh including brian
yes it is
fuckin elephant was destroyed
you wanna know what i did to get in here
i didnt have anything better to do
youre laughing at me
allison starts to laugh too
yeah you are
we see brian putting a record on and then music starts
we see them all dancing
this goes on for the duration of the song
we see bender crawling back through the heating duct
andrew allison claire and brian are sitting in that order on the railing
are you gonna write your paper
well its kinda a waste for all of us to write our paper dont you think
oh but thats what vernon wants us to do
true but i think wed all kinda say the same thing
you just dont want to write your paper
true but youre the smartest right
with pride oh well
we trust you
brian glances over at allison and andrew who nod in approval
all right ill do it
claire looks at allison who looks back
to allison come on
wherere we going
we see claire putting eye make up on allison
dont be afraid
dont stick that in my eye
im not sticking it just close
just go like that
claire closes her eyes
allison mimics her
claire puts the make up on her and allison squeals
you know you really do look a lot better without all that black shit on your eyes
i like that black shit
this looks a lot better
we see brian thinking about what hes going to write
we see andrew just thinking
we see allison and claire again
claire is still putting make up on allison
please whyre you being so nice to me
cause youre letting me
we see brian begin to write
we see andrew still deep in thought
we see bender in the closet once again
claire opens the door and enters
claire stares at him
brian is busily preparing the essay
andrew looks up and sees the newly made over allison and is in awe
allison walks towards him and stops when she notices brian staring at her with his mouth open
she glares at him
smiling thank you
claire kisses bender then she breaks the kiss
whyd you do that
cause i knew you wouldnt
you know how you said before how your parents used you to get back at each other
wouldnt i be outstanding in that capacity
were you really disgusted about what i did with my lipstick
bender nods and speaks at the same time
we see brian lift up his paper and kiss it
we see andrew and allison
what happened to you
claire did it
nothings wrong its just so different
i can see your face
is that good or bad
laughing its good
we see brian laugh and give himself a congratulatory punch in the arm
the five are walking down the hall where they are met by carl sweeping up
brian nods at him
see ya brian
to carl see you next saturday
brian gets into his dads car and leaves
andrew and allison kiss allison rips a patch off andrews jacket and gets into the car
andrews dad arrives and looks at him then at allison
andrew gets into the car and they drive off
we see claire take out one of her diamond earrings and put it into benders hand
they kiss and she gets into her car
we see bender put the earring in his ear
we see vernon pick up brians essay and begin to read
vernon we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong
but we think youre crazy to make an essay telling you who we think we are
you see us as you want to see us
in the simplest terms in the most convenient definitions
we see bender walking towards us as brians monologue continues
but what we found out is that each one of us is a brain
and an athlete
and a basket case
and a criminal
does that answer your question
sincerely yours the breakfast club
we see bender walking across the football field as he thrusts his fist into the air in a silent cheer and freezes there
