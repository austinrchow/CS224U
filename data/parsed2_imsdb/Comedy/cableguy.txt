the cable guy by judd apatow based on a screenplay by lou holtz jr
shooting script october white revised pages november blue revised pages november pink credits begin
the entire frame is filled with white noise within which one can make out thefaint image of a television program
every few moments the channel changes revealing a new ghostly image
the camera pulls back very slowly
we reveal that this image is coming from a twenty seven inch television
the camera pulls back some more and we see a mans hand enter frame holding a remote control
the hand changes channels frantically
the camera pulls back into its final position and we see steven bartowsky thirty years old sitting on his couch
he is trying to find a channel with viewable reception
unfortunately for him his cable is not hooked up
looks at watch jesus wheres the cable guy already
it is a stylish old apartment
there are half unpacked boxes strewn about the floor
steven has just moved in
the phone rings
into the phone hello
we see stevens best friend rick standing in the middle of a busy newsroom
he is a rough looking cynical local news cameraman
in the background hanging from the ceiling is a television set
on the tv an anchorman sits at his desk fixing his hair as he waits to go on the air
a graphic on the screen says sam sweet trial update
hows the move going
steven unpacks as they speak
the phone call intercuts between the two locations
the cable guy is missing in action
apparently hes going to be here sometime between eight am and my death
you havent called robin have you
please tell me you didnt call her
sarcastically no im giving her space
beat i cant believe shes doing this
you never should have asked her to marry you
youre the mad smotherer
all she had to do was say no
she didnt have to kick me out
i feel like felix unger
you forced her to evaluate the relationship
if you didnt propose she would never have realized how unhappy she was
i dont want to talk about it
so what time are you going to come by
im working double shifts the rest of the week
its my first night here
dont do this to me
the other camera guy pulled out his back
besides i spent the last two weeks with you on my couch
isnt that enough
one piece of advice
slip the cable guy fifty bucks hell give you all the movie channels for free
even the dirty ones
im not good at that stuff
what if he says no
ill feel like an idiot
none of them say no believe me
ill talk to you later
steven hangs up and waits
steven continues unpacking
he is very neat
he opens a box and finds a pictures of him with his ex girlfriend
he looks at one sadly considering whether or not to put it on display
he puts it back in the box
establishing shot of a renovated apartment building built in the nineteen twenties
a moving truck pulls into a gated side garage
movers deliver a small breakfast table and chairs
steven directs them as to where to put them
steven puts a few feet of tin foil on his antenna to help the reception
he changes channels
he pulls it off frustrated
many of the boxes are gone
steven lies on the couch staring at the ceiling fidgeting
he is unable to fill his day without cable
where the hell is he
steven paces back and forth across the room
he stares at his watch frequently
steven slowly eats a sandwich in his empty kitchen
he looks at the clock
it says five thirty
he picks up the phone and dials
a machine picks up
hi this is robin
leave a message
if you are trying to reach steven he can now be reached at
steven hangs up
steven does sit ups
he looks at the clock
to himself forget it
he gets up and walks into the bathroom
steven gets undressed
he turns on the shower adjusts the heat then gets in
he tries to lose his tension by letting the hot water engulf him
he takes some shampoo and lathers up his hair
annoyed oh great
steven jumps out of the shower soaking wet throws on a bathrobe and runs to the door
steven runs to the door
steven reaches the door and looks through the peep hole
the cable guy is walking away
steven opens the door and yells to the cable guy
revised pink hey wait
the cable guy turns back
well look who decided to show up
i was just gonna go collect my retirement pension
the cable guy wears a clean white jump suit and is extremely confident despite the fact that he speaks with a slight lisp
this lisp gives him a child like quality
you were supposed to be here four hours ago
so im the tardy one
good to know
i had to go to the bed n bath place but now its closed
turns to leave maybe i shouldnt have come at all jerk off
turns back smiling im just joking
lets do this
looks around oh the old mcnair place
i never thought theyd get the floors clean after what happened here
long beat they had a lot of cats
they walk into stevens living room
hey this could be a cool pad
here is a comment card
he pulls out a card and hands it to steven without turning back to look at him
please mail it in when i am done
these go to your boss
no they go to me
im a perfectioniss
he strains to lose his lisp perfectioniss
now lets take a look at what were dealing with
the cable guy walks around the room with his hands out sensing the space
come on baby
come on baby
talk to me baby
tell me where you like it
thats it baby
he zones in on one wall
he fells the wall in a sensuous manner
heres your sweet spot
he pulls out his drill and begins drilling
so your lady kicked you out
in preparing your service i noticed you were previously wired across town at and a half chestnut
last week the billing was transferred to one robin harris
smells like heartbreak to me
i really dont want to talk about it with you
could you please just install my cable
im going to get dressed
steven walks away into the hallway
a moment later the cable guy runs to him
hey im going to go to the hallway so i can access the floorboards
dont be spooked if you hear someone crawling underneath you
steven walks toward his bedroom
put on your bathing suit cause youll be channel surfing in no time
the cable guy pulls the trigger on his drill twice to punctuate his joke
rikki klieman from court tv broadcasts from their studio
to camera so ends day fifty four of the trial of former child star sam sweet who has been accused of shooting his twin brother stan in cold blood
the twins were stars of the hit sitcom double trouble which aired from nineteen seventy seven till nineteen eighty four
a video package rolls in we see several photographs of sam sweet and his twin brother at various ages
included is the cast photo of double trouble
pictured in the photo are eight year old stan and sam and conrad janis as their single dad
we see a brief clip from double trouble starring the two eight year old boys then a shot of sam sweet being taken out of a police car in handcuffs
to camera life wasnt so sweet after the cancellation of their program
hollywood chewed them up and spit them out
a frustrated sam turned to petty larceny while his more impressionable brother stan fell in with a fringe cult called the brotherhood of friends
reduced to tabloid fodder a fury was growing inside of sam
a burning need to be recognized as an individual not a person famous for having an identical twin
a need that took the form of four shotgun blasts on the night of november fourteenth
and so today his attorneys continue the unusual defense of twin envy
steven re enters the room
the cable guy is watching television
hows it going
the cable guy holds up one finger as if to say quiet
his eyes never leave the tv
guilty guilty guilt freakin tee
i hope they fry this bastard
steven sees that the cable guy has completely redecorated the room in a fashion which makes the room impractical for anything other than watching television
the tv is now on the stairs blocking the entrance into the living room
all furniture faces the tv making conversation impossible
looks around what happened
jumps to his feet the arrangement of your major appliances and your furniture was causing some noisy pics and hum bars in your reception
i moved a few things
cleared it right up
is that cool
non confrontational i
off of stevens look then let me slave your remotes
he picks up stevens remotes punches in a complicated series of commands then points them at each other
as he holds them together he makes a face as if their power is surging through him
ooh maybe we should leave these two alone
so after this ill only need one remote for everything
you know youre pretty good at this
you could be a cable guy yourself
he finishes now let me check your levels
with amazing alacrity he adjusts color setting sound controls closed captioned etc
then he clicks through the channels
a music video documentary on hitler oprah winfrey show starving kids barney court tv
the cable guy watches emotionless
that about does it
i just have some paperwork for you to fill out
that gave me power of attorney over you
the cable guy joins him but then continues to laugh way too hard for way too long
as the laugh ends it quickly turns into an awkward moment
the cable guy does not want to leave
im about finished here
i feel good about this
cable guy walks to the door
turns back immediately yeah
i have this friend and he said he gave his cable guy fifty bucks and he got free movie channels
have you ever heard of anything like that
deadly serious you mean illegal cable
who told you that
i want his name
youre offering me a bribe
what you have just done is illegal and in this state if convicted you could be fined five thousand dollars or spend six months in a correctional facility
that was dumb
i was just making conversation laughs im just jerking your chain
wake up little snoozy
ill juice you up
all it is is a push of a button
he puts his arm around steven and walks him toward the front door
dont worry about it
i couldnt charge you
your girl just booted you
consider it one guy doing another guy a solid
that is so nice
hey youre a nice guy
youd be surprised how many customers treat you like shit like im a god damn plumber or something
hands him a card here is my personal beeper number
its just for my preferred customers
never call the company theyll just put you on hold
holds up comment card jokes youre gonna get some good marks here
maybe some day ill take you out to the satellite and show you how all this stuff works
its really incredible
we should do that one day
how bout tomorrow
tomorrows not good
what are you going to do sit home and stew about your ex
insulted oh okay
i guess i crossed the line
guilty you didnt cross the line
ill pick you up at six thirty
on the flip side
the cable guy leaves before steven can reconsider
steven cannot believe he just got roped into that
end revision pink steven is in the middle of a presentation to his co workers
his boss hal daniels looks impressed
steven pulls a sheet off of an architects model of a condominium complex
there are twenty four classrooms each can be converted into a square foot home
the facility has two tennis courts an olympic size pool and full gym with a stage if the residents decide they want to perform oklahoma
steven is very good at his job
the kitsch appeal of living in an old schoolhouse should be very attractive to young upwardly mobile home buyers
and most important the structure is available in foreclosure
if we put down a cash bid were going to steal this thing
there is a pause then everyone applauds
daniels walks over to steven and puts a proud arm around him
they speak as the meeting breaks up
great work steve o
so youre feeling good
did i hear something about you having some troubles at home
robin and i have been having a difficult time
i moved out but i really think its only temporary
i love this project but its a big mother
know what i mean
if it fails corporates going to have my ass
ive got confidence in you but you hear where im coming from bro
now ive got more time than ever
its a good thing
laughs i know i can pull this thing off
playfully then what are you doing talking to me
youve got a lot of work to do
get to it
hal goes down the stairs to his office
steven watches him disappear then turns to his secretary ill be right back
steven walks through the halls looking for robins office
robin harris an attractive woman in her late twenties sits at her desk at sassy magazine
her office is fairly nice but she is definitely not at the upper level of the company yet
there are papers spread all over her desk
on her walls are pictures from the magazine and articles she has written
steven peeks his head in her door
robins face drops
steven what are you doing here
i was just in the area
thought id pop by
howd the big teen crush article come out
revised blue they liked it
beat i thought we agreed we werent going to see each other for a month
i know its just daniels accepted my proposal to renovate the old schoolhouse
thats wonderful congratulations
i know im breaking the rules but come have dinner with me tonight to celebrate
i dont think we should
come on this is the biggest day of my career
dont put me in this position
i want to share this with you
feeling pressured i love you but i need to take some time on my own to see how i feel
you agreed to this
this is exactly why we broke up because you never listen to me
now were broken up
what happened to trial separation
i cant get into this now
if you havent noticed im at work
sorry to disturb you
he turns to leave
revised pink sincerely steven
i know how much this means to you
you deserve it
steven is watching television
he looks lonely and depressed
he clicks around in a daze never stopping for more than a second
he hears a horn honking outside
on the tv a commercial for medieval times restaurant
steven walks over to the window and sees the cable guy standing in front of his van leaning in his window honking the horn
waves hey buddy
come on down
steven waves and then steps back from the window
he doesnt know what to do
he looks at the television
on the tv the local news
coming up next a special report loneliness americas silent killer
steven looks back out the window and sees the cable guy smiling and waving for him to come down
begins walking to the door what the hell
steven walks from his apartment to the customized van
on the side of the white van it says the cable company get wired today
hows it going
steven gets in
the van drives onto the main boulevard
thanks for coming out
you know most people think cable is just a simple co ax that comes out of the wall
they never take the time to understand how it works
where exactly are we goin
were going to take a ride on the information superhighway
birds eye p
shot follows the cable guys van as it drives through the city
it all started in lansford pennsylvania where panther valley television with the assistance of jerrod electronics created the first cable television system
the van drives up into the hills finally revealing a huge satellite dish on top of a small mountain overlooking the entire city
i went to lansford once
its the cable guys mecca
it was very emotional
steven and the cable guy get out of the van and walk down a trail
i come here to think sometimes
to clear my head
they turn a corner and the satellite dish is right in front of them
it is enormous
next to it is a one hundred and fifty foot antenna
next to that is a small fenced in shack where the satellites controls are located
there she is
right now shes sending entertainment and information to millions of satisfied citizens
thats pretty impressive
see i knew the moment i met you that you would appreciate this
the cable guy runs to the dish
a few seconds later he appears inside of it
with wonder the future is now
soon every american home will integrate their television phone and computer
youll be able to visit the louvre on one channel and watch female mud wrestling on another
you can do your shopping at home or play mortal kombat with a friend in vietnam
theres no end to the possibilities
waves to steven come on up
what are you waiting for
the cable guy and steven are lying in the middle of the dish looking up at the night sky
sometimes ill sit here and imagine that there are billions of bits of information surging through me
ive watched a lot of tv in my life
i guess ive always taken it for granted
when i was a kid my mom worked nights
never met dad
but the old tv was always there for me
i know what you mean
my dad was there but he might as well have been gone
my mom is a stewardess
she was always out of town
moved thats tough
you must have a lot of abandonment issues
reality isnt father knows best its a kick in the face on saturday night
but what doesnt kill us makes us stronger right
tentative you know my brothers a speech therapist
the cable guy sits up
he looks angry
there is a long silence
steven doesnt know how to react
the cable guy sits back down and pretends steven never mentioned it
beat so youre pretty love struck about your lady huh
i miss her
i asked her to marry me and she asked me to move out
i hate that
she said she felt pressured
can you believe that
women are a labyrinth
can i be frank
i dont think you listen to her
i think you try to tell her what she wants to hear
she wants you to thirst for knowledge about who she is
all the complicated splendor that is woman
when your love is truly giving it will come back to you ten fold
that is remarkably insightful
yeah it was jerry springers final thought on fridays show
the van pulls up in front of stevens apartment building
you know what
women are suckers for sleepless in seattle
its on hbo this month
thats your bait right there
robin loves that movie
they all do
next time you talk to her tell her youre cooking yourself dinner and watching it by yourself
sound like youre happier than a pig in shit
shell come running
then just play it cool
maybe i will
steven gets out of the car
thanks a lot
im embarrassed to say this but i dont know your name
what is it
touched you really want to know my name
its ernie douglas
but my friends call me chip
ill see ya chip
before he can exit the van the cable guy is staring him in the eyes
lets just remember right now
you know some people walk through their entire lives and never find a true friend
long pause i guess were the lucky ones
end revised pink stevens p
the cable guy is in slow motion
he blinks once
ill catch ya on the flip side
steven exits the van feeling a little uncomfortable
steven and robin are talking
robin does not look happy to see him
i dont listen to you
i pretend to understand but im really just saying what i think you want to hear
so from now on im going to try my best to listen more because i do love you and am interested in learning about every detail about the complicated splendor
that is you
robin looks at him somewhat shocked
i want us to get back together but i can see why taking this time might be good for us
so im not mad
after a long beat robin smiles
sometimes time apart is healthy
well thats what i came here to say
look ive got to get back to the office
he starts getting up
so are you doing anything tomorrow
im just going to cook myself dinner and watch a movie
sleepless in seattle is on cable
if youre around you should drop by and check out the new apartment
okay maybe i will
he exits the room
as he does we see a television broadcasting the sweet case
on mtv sam sweet sits behind the defendants table
tabitha soren is giving the news update
today in the sam sweet case the prosecution played the call that sam sweet made the night he murdered his brother
keep in mind he confessed one month later
the courtroom listens to a phone call
the transcription is seen on the screen
crying and babbling hello please send help
my twin brother has been shot
slow down sir
oh my god they shot him with a shot gun four times
i mean i think it was a shotgun
who would do such a thing
i think it was an asian gang or something
they were speaking some other language
sam leans over and whispers something in his lawyers ear
coming up next a rare interview with michael jacksons zoo keeper
steven is playing a pick up full court basketball game with some of his friends
it is a competitive but friendly game
steven is on skins rick is on shirts
here here here
a player passes to steven
rick is covering him
steven drives to the basket and puts in a lay up
to himself shit
not your fault
im in the zone
there is no stopping me today
play begins again
a player named jeff takes the ball out then passes to a heavy set player who catches the ball then drives to the basket
when he does he twists his ankle dropping the ball
the ball rolls out of bounds into a dark corner of the gym
we follow it as it rolls on the ground until it hits a mans sneaker
a pair of hands pick up the ball
the camera tilts up the mans body
it is the cable guy
he is holding another ball
he starts dribbling the two balls in a circular pattern
hey you guys play here too
i was just in the neighborhood
thought id run the court for a couple of innings
gestures to injured player great
we need another man
my cable guy
rick smiles in recognition
we met about a week ago during a routine installation but i feel like ive known him my whole life
steven cant believe this is happening
all right chip douglas youre on shirts
no i want to be on stevens team
the cable guy quickly takes off his shirt
steven looks shocked because underneath his clothes he is rippled with muscles
the dichotomy between his nerdy face and his awesome physique is scary
i dont care ill be shirts
lets just play
wait a sec
ive got to warm up
the cable guy starts running wind sprints across the court touching all the main lines
everyone stares at him until he finishes
lets get it on
are you any good
feed me under the boards and youll find out
the shirts inbound to jeff
the cable guy is all over him covering him as tightly as humanly possible
he keeps his hands near jeffs face whacks him in the back as he dribbles etc
he couldnt be more annoying
jeff passes to rick who drives to the basket and puts up a shot which goes in
rick and jeff slap hands
doing the traveling hand signal traveling
yeah whatever you say chip
everyone runs down the court ignoring him
all right so were playing that type of game
i get it
steven takes the ball out
the cable guy runs around the court attempting to get open
he criss crosses all over the court
feed me the rock
feed me the rock
steven passes to the cable guy who drives to the basket pushing jeff out of the way in the process
the ball goes in
does the foul hand signal and one
thats definitely a foul
to jeff you want to mug me my wallet is in my other pants
to cable guy what are you doing
dont play from fear steven
we can take these guys
the shirts put a shot which doesnt go in
the cable guy swings his elbows wildly as he pulls it down
the cable guy drives to the basket in slow motion violently taking down two men including rick
rick drives to the basket
on his way he fakes out steven who falls to the floor
the cable guy helps steven up
as the cable guy walks across the court he bangs shoulders with rick
the cable guy passes the ball to steven then sets a nasty pick against rick who goes down hard
take it to the hole
steven is so un nerved by the cable guys behavior that he misses a simple lay up
steven grabs his own rebound
when he puts up a second shot rick gently fouls him
steven stumbles to the ground
the ball does not go in
hey are you okay
he pulls steven up
ill cover rick
the cable guy gets in ricks face and gives him a death stare
steven takes out the ball
he passes to a teammate who passes it to the cable guy who drives to the basket then literally steps on ricks back and leaps into the air and dunks
enraged what the hell was that
ive had enough
everyone begins to exit the court
thanks for bringing your friend
the cable guy runs up to rick
slaps rick on the butt you were tough out there
your play brought me up to a higher level
i mean that
he shakes his head and exits with the rest of the players
what are you doing
it was payback time
i was protecting you
revised pink you ruined the game
i dont appreciate your tone steven
thats not the way friends speak to each other
what are you talking about
i dont even know you
well lets fix that
let me buy you a heineken
no im going home
steven turns to leave
well uh i guess well talk later
ive got to go shower up and do some stuff
ill call you if i get a chance
or you call me
the cable guy puts his hand up for steven to high five
steven slaps it halfheartedly
then the cable guy extends his palm out low by his knee
and down low
steven stares at it for a beat
the cable guy waits
hell wait as long as it takes
finally steven gives him a low five just so he can leave
pulls his hand away so steven misses it too slow
have a good one
as he walks away yeah have a good one
steven runs in with a small bag of groceries
he is dressed for a date
he pulls out a bottle of wine
he opens the oven and checks on dinner
it is almost ready
then he checks his message machine as he prepares the meal
he begins chopping an onion
revised blue you have eleven messages
steven its mom

im still your mother
im getting on
steven call your mother
just checking in
give me a ring
beep whats up steven

beep tone hey steven
quick question give me a call when you get a chance
beep tone i was just taking a whiz thought you might have called
beep tone sorry i had call waiting didnt get to it thought it might have been you
all right bye
steven is beginning to get a little wigged out by this
he fast forwards through a sampling of the rest of the calls
fast forwards were having ourselves quite a little game of phone tag here
fast forwards i was just blow drying my hair and i thought i heard the phone ringing
fast forwards youre a tough man to reach
fast forwards i guess youre too busy to call your friends
revision ends blue steven fast forwards the machine
all he hears is sighing
then long beat then quiet and distant shit
the doorbell rings
steven takes a deep breath then opens the door
it is robin
she is dressed casually but looks beautiful
hey good to see you
there is an awkward moment where steven intentionally doesnt kiss her hello
come on in
what do you think of the place
she looks at the odd placement of furniture
you made some interesting choices laying out the room
embarrassed thats actually where the movers put the furniture
im gonna change it very soon
no i like it
the food is all eaten
steven and robin are sitting on the couch having an awkward conversation
so hows work
dont get me started
that guy has no vision
its like working for mr
hes just worthless
its just great that youre getting to do it
its a real step up
now if only someone at corporate smartened up enough to dump hal then i could really get some stuff done
its nice to see you doing so well
well its nice just to see you
looks at his watch hey it should be starting
they sit on the couch
robin moves to sit in closer to steven
steven turns on the television
the screen is filled with white noise
the sound is loud static
he changes channels looking for the signal
then fumbles with the remote control as he attempts to lower the volume
damn cable is out
son of a bitch
we can watch it another night
we really should see it now
nows a good time
he plays with the remote hoping it will magically come back
i know what to do
he walks over to the phone then pulls the cable guys beeper number out of his wallet
he dials it then presses the number in
the cable guys a friend of mine
ill just page him
well have this fixed in no time
revised pink steven dials the cable guys beeper number into the phone
the moment he is finished dialing steven walks to the door and opens it
standing there is the cable guy looking dark and disturbed different than weve ever seen him before
steven is startled
is there a problem with your service
my cable went out
steven pushes him out into the hall
the cable guy holds up a cut cable cord
so you called me
interesting how you call when you need something
is that how you treat people
ive been really busy
youve got to get my cable going robin is here
this is really important
he peeks in to get a look at robin
they make momentary eye contact
steven pushes him back out
but calling me back isnt
please youve got to help me
why should i help you
i gave you free cable
what have you ever done for me
anything you want
name it quickly
tomorrow night we hang out
fine whatever you want
god bless you
youre too good to me
the cable guy walks over to a fuse type box turns one knob then walks back to steven
loud normally all set
so whats with the cut cord
nonchalantly thats for effect
see ya tomorrow steven
conspiratorially shes pretty
and dont kiss her
dont even touch her
fight the urge at all costs
it will pay off later with
he makes a motion which implies sex
enjoy the flick
the cable guy walks away
steven walks back inside
who was that
steven sits down next to robin
robin moves next to him
steven looks very happy
a scene from the film sleepless in seattle
the camera pulls out and reveals the cable guy watching the film in the back of his van alone
we cannot see much of the inside of the van because the only light is that of the television but we can tell that he lives there
the cable guy and steven walk across a parking lot
steven has his eyes closed
sorry about yesterday
i was in kind of a weird mood
howd things go with you
keep em closed
look about the other night
i didnt appreciate you dont peek
i want this to be a surprise
i really dont need to be surprised
where are we going
only the best restaurant in town
they walk around a corner
okay here we are
steven opens his eyes
the camera moves behind then and reveals an enormous faux castle with a big sign on it which says medieval times restaurant
i know what youre thinking
dont worry im buying
the cable guy and steven are walking to their table
all the seating overlooks a large circular arena the kind a rodeo is held in
the entire restaurant arena is designed in medieval themed decor
all of the staff are dressed as knights sorcerers royalty etc
revision ends pink funny
i never thought i would ever come here
i love this place
i come here twice a week
a hispanic woman with a large butt walks by
the cable guy is transfixed
oh man thats my look
i love big butts
ow that hurts
he grabs his crotch and squeezes as if its the only way he can control himself
there oughta be a law
man she is hot
its just not fair
gestures to him squeezing his crotch please dont
you know what i need right now
and im not talking about the place in vietnam
good to know
they sit down
the waitress walks over
she is dressed in peroid clothes but is not enthusiastic about her job
flatly welcome to medieval times
my name is melinda
ill be your serving wench
may i get you something from the bar keep
too into it dost thou have a mug of ale for me and me mate
he has been pitched in battle for a fortnight an has a kings thirst for the beer thust thou might have for thust
uninspired ill be right back my lord
the cable guy puts something together
there you go
he hands steven a paper crown
they both put theirs on
thanks for the help
the cable guy sees something
his eyes widen
steven dont turn around but there is a woman eyeing you like you are a piece of meat and she hasnt eaten in a week
steven acts like he isnt interested but he is
what does she look like
shoes a hottie
i wish she was checking me out
man she is on fire
total robo babe
are you serious
ive got to look
okay but play it cool
just turn like you are looking for the waitress
steven puts up his hand and turns as if hes going to call for the waitress
he sees the woman
she is in her sixties and probably wasnt attractive at any stage of her life
steven turns back to the cable guy annoyed
im just messing with your mind
but you fell for it man
you are one horny indian chief
not laughing you got me
so what did you want to rap about
the trumpets go off the lights go down and the show begins
hold that thought
the cable guy turns and looks at a stage that stands at one end above the arena
welcome to a magnificent journey into the past
this is medieval times
the entire crowd filled completely with white trash tourists applauds
are you prepapred for a night of feasting and sport the likes of which ye will never forget
the audience applauds
i charge you to stand up on your feet and cheer for your sections knight
on the stands each section of the crowd is painted a color that corresponds with a knight
the cable guy stands up and cheers like he is at a wrestling match
steven remains seated
let the games begin
the red knight rules
youre going down
an embarrassed steven applauds politely
the cable guy sits down
on the floor in the center of the room two knights are fighting with swords while on horseback
on steven and the cable guy they are eating whole chickens with their bare hands while watching the show
to the watiress could i get a knife and fork
there were no utensils in medieval times so there are no utensils at medieval times
do you want a refill on that pepsi
there were no utensils but there was pepsi
look i have a lot of tables to get to
the waitress exits
stands up yells to the competitors spill his blood
take his kead
show no mercy
the two knights fight with swords
after a few moments of battle the red knight wins
the crowd erupts
the cable guy goes crazy
to steven come on get into it we won
releuctantly steven stands up and applauds
halfheartedly way to go red knight
good job of killing
steven and the cable guy sit down
so what were you saying before
tentatively how do i put this
ive really enjoyed hanging out with you but
thats why i became a cable guy
to make friends like you
every time i walk up to a new door that door is a possibility for friendship
when i walked in your apartment i knew there was something there
i just knew it
sotto oh lord
tries to get back on track i want you to know the lights change
trumpets play a fanfare
the host walks out onto the stage interrupting steven
we have reached the climax of our competition good people
now two noble men from our audience will battle to the death to resolve a grievance
will a master
looks at his clipboard steven m
bartowsky and lord ernie douglas make you way to the fighting pit
a spotlight shines on them
steven is shocked
whats going on
were going to do battle
itll be fun
is this a normal part of the show
no but i give all the knights free cable
they said it would be cool if we just went at it for a little while
two pimply faced serfs from the show come and lead them away
is this safe
thats what the armors for
steven and the cable guy are being dressed in armor by the two serfs
the cable guy could not be happier
steven is freaked out
what are we supposed to do
weve got to be careful we dont hurt each other
the cable guy doesnt answer him
he has his game face on
i cannot listen to any of your instructions for you are my sworn enemy and are about to meet your demise
before steven can answer him the trumpets blare
let the battle begin
come now people let me hear your voices
the crowd cheers
the serfs hand them each a sword and shield then walk them to the center of the pit
the cable guy crouches in a war like position
he begins to circle steven like a cat
steven mirrors him not sure of what to do
just take it easy
the cable guy runs at steven and swings his sword
in fear steven puts his shield over his head
the sword smashes into it sending sparks into the air
the cable guy darts toward steven and pokes him several times with his sword
each time steven blocks it with either his sword or his shield
enraged what are you doing
matter of fact im trying to kill you
the cable guy grabs a mace a stick with a chain and ball attached to it off of a weapon filled wall and runs at steven swinging with abandon
steven blocks the deadly mace with his shield
hey watch it
the cable guy leaps onto steven
then he speaks into his ear as he pushes him down onto the ground
this is just like when spock had to fight kirk on star trek
best friends forced to do battle
steven gets angry and pushes the cable guy off of him
he swings at the cable guy with his sword just missing him
the cable guy rolls on the ground and pops back up in the air
thats the spirit
lets give em a good show
steven charges at the cable guy swinging wildly
it is a real battle now
he bangs away at the cable guys mace until he knocks it out of his hands
the cable guy runs backwards then falls on the ground
by the look in his eyes we can tell that the cable guys feelings are hurt
so thats how its gonna be huh
if you want to play rought daddy can play rough
the cable guy charges at steven with his shield
he upper cuts the shield to stevens face sending him to the ground
the cable guy runs to the wall and grabs a huge battle ax a four foot long stick with a fancy silver blade on the end of it
he swings it in circles like a japanese master
steven grabs a similar weapon and then begin to circle each other
chip this isnt funny
will you stop it
the name is spock
if we dont battle to the death theyll kill us both
good bye jim
he swings his sword and they battle star trek style
the cable guy begins to sing the star trek battle music as they fight
this isnt star trek
they bang the handles of their battle axes together jockeying for position
the cable guy pushes steven away from him then takes a huge swing but steven leaps in the air over the blade
the cable guy swings over his head and steven blocks it with his ax handle
they continue to swing and roll in a vicious battle
then the cable guy takes a swing which steven is unable to block
the battle ax cuts through part of stevens protection
looking down jesus
the cable guy runs to a horses entrance
there is a long pause and then we hear the sound of pounding horse hooves
a moment later the cable guy rides out on a horse holding a jousting stick
the shows host runs up to steven
quickly muster a top your steed
steven doesnt move the host drops character get on the god damn horse
i dont think hes kidding
left with no choice steven jumps on a horse and grabs a joust
the host smacks stevens horse sending it straight toward the charging cable guy
dont do this
jim we have no choice
oh my god
they run toward each other
a horrible game of chicken
neither gives in
when they reach one another steven knocks the cable guy off his horse with his jousting stick
the cable guy flies through the air lands on his back
steven rides to him
jumps off his horse throws off his helmet
concerned are you okay
the cable guy sits up and smile at him
well done good sir
you are the victor but we shall meet again
the two serfs put steven on a chair connected to two poles
they carry him to the center of the arena in victory
the crowd cheers wildly
steven feels the adrenaline rush
he holds up his arms in triumph and smiles
they are walking up the stairs
youve got a real warriors instinct
ive got to admit theres a real feeling of power holding that jousting stick
if robin saw you tonight she would be begging you to take her back
im telling you these knights get laid all the time
we should go again next week
easy there lancelot
steven opens the door to his apartment
steven pops into the kitchen and hits a button on his answering machine
you have zero messages
nobody loves ya
grabs a beer from the fridge hey i think i left my staple gun in the living room the other day
could you be a pal
steven walks to the living room
steven turns on the lights
what do you think
stevens entire stereo system and tv have been replaced with a sixty five inch television laser disc player karaoke machine and a brand new stereo system
all top of the line
what is this
i took the liberty of updating your in home entertainment system
i got you the big screen plus thx quality sound that would make george lucas cream in his pants

steven picks up the staple gun
the cable guy pulls out a leather pouch
steven drops the staple gun in the pouch
the cable guy never touches it
steven dials the phone
on his computer screen a graphic reads hello steven have a into the phone robin its steven again

he hangs up
he is getting frustrated
the door opens
hal daniels sticks his head in but does not enter
hows it going

the phone rings
through the intercom robin on line two
steven lights up
he takes a deep breath then answers the phone

the cable guy is driving around
he speaks on a cellular phone

it sure would be a pity to leave that karaoke machine a virgin
what do you mean
tomorrow night you are having a karaoke jam
no ifs ands or buts
well maybe a few butts
we pull out to reveal we are in stevens living room
it is populated with about twenty odd looking misfits mingling and dancing to the music
among them we see rick looking very uncomfortable
steven is on the phone
he is dressed up
occasionally a misfit enters and grabs a drink from the fridge
did you get my message
the scene intercuts between the two locations
robin is dressed up and on her way out
you left me five messages

steven hangs up the phone
the cable guy appears and hands him a beer

revised blue youre probably right
damn right im right
oh i got you a little something
he hands a box to the cable guy
i thought you said we were even
youre breaking the rules
so shoot me
he opens it
the box says lose your lisp in thirty days
the cable guy is so moved he cannot speak
my brother said it might help with your lisp
the cable guy looks steven in the eye for a long beat then hugs him hard
words cannot express
he is too moved to finish his sentence its no big deal
yes it is
he stares at steven until it makes him uncomfortable
now im on a mission
this has got to be the best party ever
they walk into the living room
a sad looking older man is singing superfreak
everyones having fun
we see a couple of off duty policemen in uniform mingling with the crowd
revision ends blue youve got plenty of friends
these people are acquaintances
theyre not ride to the airport friends like us
sees something whoa chick alert at three oclock
a real barn burner
youre playing with me again
no sirree steven
this woman is all over you like a lamp shade
he turns and sees a stunning woman standing in the middle of a group of male and female misfits
when he looks at her she smiles
he quickly turns back
did it just get hotter in here
grabs his crotch oh that hurts
whod she come with
i dont know but she looks pretty available to me
id strike while the iron is hot
he who hesitates masturbates know what im saying
a nerdy balding man walks over to rick
he sure can throw a party
chips an incredible man
i really admire him
where do you know him from
he hooked up my cable
didnt charge me either
thats the kind of guy he is
revised blue steven slowly walks over to the pretty woman

ill have a shot of tequila if you will
coming right up
at the karaoke area steven and heather are singing youre the one that i want from grease
they are both drunk and having a great time
the cable guy walks over to rick
im glad you accepted my invitation
steven invited me
the cable guy looks at steven and heather
look at him
have you ever seen him so alive
hes changing rick
youve got to learn to live with that
i dont know what your story is chip douglas but im going to find out
the song ends
rick walks away
he waves to steven as he heads out
steven runs over to him
im getting out of here
this is a great party
this girl is really into me
youre whacked man
that guy is bad news
you dont even know him
youre just mad cause he kicked your ass in basketball
i cant even deal
im outta here
on the cable guy at the karaoke area
he speaks into the microphone
first of all id like to thank steven for being such a terific host
steven smiles and does a half wave to everyone as they applaud
dont forget to kick in some spinach for the beer
steven aint made of money
and i expect some of you to join in the clean up crew
do a song
false coyness no
i really couldnt
do your song
okay just to stop that guy from begging
this number is dedicated to all of the ladies in the house
he puts on a janet jackson type microphone then breaks into a fast paced rap of the song bust a move accompanied by elaborate dance moves
rapping lyrics to bust a move
during the musical break the cable guy begins to break dance
he knows all the moves
the robot the spider the crab
he looks like a deranged cast member or electric boogaloo
the guests go crazy
you sounded just like olivia newton john
ive been practicing for years
laughs so what do you do
i can barely hear you
do you want to talk in the other room
they walk into stevens bedroom
lyrics to bust a move
steven and heather are sitting on the bed talking
she says she wants a break and thats fine with me
i think i needed some time also
i know what you mean
she leans in and kisses him
the cable guy has got all of the guests in a frenzy
lyrics to bust a move
steven and heather are kissing passionately
suddenly the door flies open and the cable guy dances into the room takes out a polaroid instamatic camera and flashes a picture of them
steven is disoriented
behind the cable guy in the hallway is everyone from the party
lyrics to bust a move
he continues to rap dance and flash pictures of everyone as he dances out of the room
steven walks into the living room looking a little disheveled
the cable guy is cooking him breakfast
good morning sleepy head
i hope you dont mind i crashed on the couch
bacon and eggs coming up
where did heather go
i heard her slip out early this morning
what a night
that was just what i needed
revision ends blue you look like a new man
i feel like a new man
i was getting so used to being rejected
i really liked her
hey it was my treat
taken aback what do you mean it was your treat
you know i bought this time you buy next time
getting concerned buy what
you know the women
you mean heather is a prostitute
of course she is
do you think a woman like that would hang out with us if we werent paying
dont tell me you didnt know
i cant believe this
he sits in a chair and leans over in pain
shes clean i assure you
i tried her out last week to make sure she was top quality and im as healthy as a horse
not a drip
shes the best ask any of my friends
youve got to be kidding
please tell me shes a friend of yours
youre just playing with my mind again right
i wish i had friends like that
get out of my house
dont be ashamed of yourself
i know she was a working girl but she kind of liked you
you might have been able to get a freebie
i dont ever want to see you again
to himself robin is never going to forgive me
ill tell you how to handle that
dont tell her
you want to get her back ill help you get her back
i dont want your help
i want you to leave
gestures to the tv and take that stuff out of here
i can take a hint
ill see ya
the cable guy exits
shot robin and a date enter the restaurant
we move to reveal the cable guy driving up in his van
he watches them from across the street
a moment later he heads inside
the cable guy enters the restaurant
the hostess walks over to him
may i help you
no im meeting someone here
he looks around the restaurant then spots robin and a handsome chiseled man at a table
they are on a date
the cable guy looks angry
he walks to the restroom
an older bathroom attendant stands in front of the sinks
on the counter sits a variety of toiletries
a man washes his hands
the bathroom attendant hands him some paper towels
the man puts a tip in the basket and exits
the cable guy walks over to the bathroom attendant
he dramatically whips out a twenty dollar bill and puts it in front of the bathroom attendants nose
youve been working hard
take a break
robin is talking to her date ray
he is handsome and somewhat goofy
they have empty salad plates in front of them
my brother and i wanna start our own sun block company
but the twist is its only for skiing
we havent decided yet
do you think that sounds good
that sounds right
so gail told me youre just coming off a relationship
well not really
were kind of in a holding pattern
he wants more of a commitment but i dont think im ready
i just want to have a good time for a while
then we got to get you on a skidoo
high powered snow mobile
itll blow your mind
it flies over powder like its glass
their waitress passes by
impatiently hey how are you doing on that chicken
have the eggs hatched yet
robin is mortified by his behavior
so hows your work going
its been crazy
they just hired a hold that thought
i have to use the rest room
be right back
robin looks relieved to have a break
ray enters the restroom
the cable guy is now wearing the bathroom attendants blue shirt white pants and a thin fake moustache
a distinguished man walks over and washes his hands
to cable guy towel please
the man puts out his hand to take the paper towel but the cable guy doesnt hand it to him he grabs the mans hands and surrounds them with several
paper towels and begins drying them furiously
when hes done he takes a beat and wipes them over and over just to make sure theyre dry
the man is aghast
enjoy your meal the man exits
ray walks toward the stalls
good evening sir
pleasant night isnt it
but i guess the weathers always pleasant in here
the winters are remarkably mild
he laughs at his own joke
ray walks into the handicapped stall
if you need anything just let me know
anything at all
getting annoyed i think i can handle it
ray unzips his fly and prepares to pee standing up
suddenly as if out of thin air the cable guy is standing right behind him
he speaks into rays ear startling him
im here to serve you
get out of here
most people never bother to take advantage of all my services for instance the cable guy grabs the back of rays shirt kicks his feet out from under him and
slams his face into the toilet bowl sloshing it around
ray struggles but the cable guy is too strong
i can help you wash up
cleanliness is so very important
he pulls his face out
then once youre done i have a variety of skin care products which can make you look years younger
the cable guy kicks the door open and pulls ray toward the counter
he grabs a bottle of lotion
this lotion is superb at removing liver spots
he slaps it onto rays face
this one is an excellent moisturizer
the cable guy pours some after cologne into his hands and rubs his hands together as if hes about to put it on rays face
and one can never underestimate the effects of a good cologne
the cable guy rears back and slaps ray across the face
and now a touch of powder
he takes a large powder puff and smashes it into rays face temporarily blinding him
grabs a tweezer ooh i almost forget its oh so very important to be properly tweezed
the cable guy plucks several hairs out from between rays eyebrows
youre on a big date youll need fresh breath
he takes a clear jar of combs and pours the blue fluid and the combs into rays mouth
whoops thats not mouth wash
but that reminds me
proper hair care is a must
the cable guy combs his soaking wet hair into a very goofy looking side part
looking good now lets dry you off
he runs ray face first into the starting button of an automatic hand dryer
it turns on
the cable guy puts his face right up next to the air
now suck it
suck the air
ray hesitantly puts his mouth around the nozzle and his cheeks start fluttering like an astronaut experiencing heavy g force
from this angle you look just like neil armstrong experiencing g force
i believe you have the right stuff
the cable guy pulls him away and smashes his face into the tip basket
dont worry about the tip
but ive got one for you
whispers into his ear stay away from robin
he tosses him out the door
the door opens and ray falls to the floor
robin sits alone at her table
she looks at her watch
in the background the cable guy slips out
steven is watching television while eating a tv dinner
heres a bizarre story from downtown where a man was beaten in a restroom by an assailant disguised as a bathroom attendant
the victim has been unable to speak since the unmotivated attack
we see the image of a shaken up ray being led out of the restaurant by two police officers
a police sketch artist put together this drawing from witnesses descriptions
we see a drawing which looks a little like the cable guy
in it he has a moustache and appears to be hispanic
steven looks carefully
does he know that man
he changes the channel
on the tv the fox logo flies up followed by a slick promo for a fox movie of the week on the sam sweet trial
tonight on fox the true story behind the trial thats captured the nation
we see eric roberts holding a shotgun pointed at another scared eric roberts
the jury may still be out but the chilling facts are in
eric roberts in his dramatic debut is sam and stan sweet
brother sweet brother the killing of stanton sweet
tonight on fox
the cable guy walks over to a female neighbor
excuse me apartment is robin harris
points its right upstairs
there is a loud knock
robin walks to the door and opens it without undoing the chain
who is it
the cable guy sticks his face as far into the crack of the door as possible
its the cable guy
theres no problem with my cable
ive got an upgrade order for one robin harris
the rainbow package thats every pay channel available
i didnt order this
apparently youve got a secret admirer
she unlocks the chain and the cable guy quickly steps inside
was it a man named steven
i cant tell you
no i promised steven i wouldnt say
he gave it away on purpose
they both laugh
whoops i slipped
well you didnt hear it from me
the cable guy is in the air duct
he is pulling cord
he reaches an area of the duct which opens up to a vent
he looks through and sees robin changing in the bedroom
he tries not to look at robin undress
he turns away
im sorry steven
im just a man
he turns back and looks at her
he notices a birthmark on her back
the cable guy is on his way out
that about does it
so are you a friend of stevens
im proud to say i am
i installed his cable recently and we just hit it off
you fixed his cable the other night
suspicious so you guys are going out a lot
that man is devoted to you
you know im probably crossing a boundary telling you this but hes really crazy about you
did he say that
only every five minutes
quite frankly im sick of hearing it
no im just kidding with you
looks her deeply in the eyes hes a good man
he mentioned that you guys have had some problems
well its a little complicated
it always is
you know i asked a woman to marry me once
she said she wanted to think about it
we agreed to take some time apart to re assess our feelings
to give each other
chokes up well she is no longer with us
im so sorry
sometimes you dont have the time you think you have
just promise me youll never go bungee jumping in mexico
embarrassed that he spoke too much anyway ive got to go
he quickly departs
we hold on robin for a beat
the cable guy smiles proud of himself
establishing shot of the building
we hear stevens cellular phone ring
steven holds on a cellular phone as he walks down the long gothic hallway of a half renovated school house
around him construction workers go about their business
i love you
robin is on the phone
love you too
that was so sweet of you
playing along oh
you didnt have to do that
giving me free cable
only you would do that
you got it
yes your friend came by
the cable guy
i liked him
he was kind of goofy but nice
thank you so much for doing that
glad you liked it
ive wanted to do something nice for you but ive been trying to give you your space
well i dont think we should make rules anymore
revised blue call me later if youre around
ill call you as son as i get home
steven is elated
he can barely contain himself
steven are you ready to go
steven turns and sees rick wearing a soundgarden t shirt
pained the concert
robin just called
i think were getting back together
pissed so youre blowing me off
i cant believe this
this is the first time she asked to get back together
you do this every time
you only call me after a girl breaks your heart
oh rick can i stay on your couch
lets talk all night about how mean girls are
then as soon as a relationship starts again its bye bye rick
i dont know why i fall for it anymore
it is raining
rick pulls up and drops steven off
cant you get someone else to go
revision ends blue maybe ill take my cable guy
steven gets out of the car
rick drives off
steven walks up the steps to his apartment
the cable guy appears from behind a corner
pretty smooth work
i set em up you knock em down
i got her back for you
i juiced her up
how do you know were back together
free cable is the ultimate aphrodisiac
i dont want you messing around with my life
youve caused enough trouble as it is
i felt bad about the other night so i wanted to make it up to you
so what are you doing
do you want to catch a bite
steve looks the cable guy in the eye
sincerely yet curt look i appreciate you helping me out with robin
but you have to understand im going to have to work extra hard to not screw this relationship up again
youre a great guy but i just dont have any room in my life for a new friend
do you understand
i appreciate your honesty
youre a real straight shooter
revised blue so youre okay
hey im a big boy
its no big deal
well take care
have a good one
the cable guy walks away
steven stands there feeling a little guilty about what he just did
on the tv conan obrien is doing a monologue joke about sam sweet
steven and robin are kissing
outside it is raining
there is occasional lightning and thunder
in the middle of kissing lightning flashes
steven looks up and sees a flash of the cable guy staring down at them his faced pressed against the skylight
in the next flash he is gone
was it real
steven looks scared
are you alright
they go back to kissing
the cable guy and robin are speaking on the phone
as the conversation continues we slowly pull back and reveal that the cable guy is standing on the top of a telephone pole dressed as a phone company employee
he speaks into a repairmans phone which is illegally hooked into the telephone pole
hey its chip douglas
your cable guy
revision ends blue surprised to hear from him oh hi
i feel kind of weird calling you
im worried about steven
what is it
something isnt right
he hasnt been himself lately
have you noticed anything
no things are actually going really well
should i be worried
im probably just being a nervous nellie
lets just keep our eyes open
nervous i will
she hangs up then dials stevens number
steven bartowsky please
his secretary joan answers the phone
hes in a meeting
a dozen of the top employees of the company steven works for are having a meeting
steven listens intently as a sales manager speaks to the group
the response to our initial offering has been remarkable
a local investment group has decided to buy the entire complex and turn them into rentals
in retrospect i must admit we made one big mistake
everyone hangs on his every word
we should have asked for more money
the entire room laughs
daniels stands up
i just want to put this out there stevey
you did it bro
you laid your cajones and mine out on the table and you slam dunked it
way to go
nervously jokes now watch theyll kick you upstairs ahead of me
all right in other business
daniels speaks joan tries to get stevens attention from a crack in the door
steven turns and sees her
she waves for him to come to her
he waves her off
more urgently quietly i really need to speak with you
some people are beginning to notice this exchange
curtly it can wait
right then two police officers storm into the room
joan stands behind them looking concerned
is there a steven bartowsky here
im steven bartowsky
whats going on
you are under arrest
on what charge
receipt of stolen merchandise
i never please put our hands on the table
steven moves a sudden move toward the police officer
the officer jabs him in the ribs with his club
steven groans then leans over in pain
please follow my instructions
hands on the table
steven puts his hands on the table
the officer kicks his legs apart then frisks him in front of everyone
it is pure humiliation
hands behind your back
the other officer cuffs him then turns him around
you have the right to remain silent
anything you say may be used against you in a court of law
you have the right to an attorney
if you cannot afford an attorney one will be provided for you
do you understand
this is all a mistake
i didnt accept any stolen goods
just then it hits him
he hears the cable guys voice in his head
with echo youre getting thx quality sound that would make george lucas cream in his pants cream in his pants
he pushes him toward the door
steven looks at everyones horrified faces as he is taken away
he tries to break the tension with a joke
im the one whos going to jail
steven is walked to a police car and put inside
we slowly reveal a man across the street at an auto shop
he is looking under the hood of his car
apparently it has broken down
the man turns and we see that it is the cable guy covertly watching stevens humiliation
as the policeman pushes steven into the car he looks at the cable guy and touches his nose
the cable guy touches his nose
steven is chained to a bench
he is speaking to his father earl a stout man of sixty and his i cant believe you did this
i didnt do anything
my cable guy gave me all that stuff as a present
a stereo system and a big screen tv as a present
you expect me to believe that
you know youre killing your mother with this
i swear its true
why would you accept such extravagant gifts
revised blue i dont know
i shouldnt have
what is really going on here steven
are you on something
i didnt do anything
please call my cable guy his name is ernie douglas
steven the police looked into it nobody named ernie douglas works for the cable company
you want to tell us the truth now falling apart thats got to be a mistake
oh this is not happening
yes it is and its killing your mother
did you deliberately want to ruin our fortieth anniversary party on monday steven
yeah dad i did
its all a big plan
to the lawyer when can you get me out of here
unfortunately its too late to get a bail hearing today
youre going to have to spend the weekend in county lock up
the entire weekend
revision ends blue steven is now wearing prison blues
he holds a pillow and a set of sheets as he walks down the long corridor to his cell
lining each side are cells filled with angry prisoners who throw things at steven and taunt him as he walks by
it is a nightmare
look at the pretty boy
nobody touches him hes mine
you touch him youre dead
is baby scared
dont cry baby
they all laugh and scream at him until he reaches his cell
a guard opens the door
steven enters his cell
he turns and inside is an angry looking prisoner
the door is locked behind him
ooh looks like i won the lottery
a guard walks steven in
his lawyer sits on the other side of the glass with his back to steven
steven sits down and picks up the phone excited to hear any news
what did you hear
what did you hear
the man turns around
it is not stevens lawyer it is the cable guy dressed in an expensive suit
i came as soon as i heard
stevens head sinks
who are you
whats your real name
so many questions
why are you doing this to me
i didnt do this to you you did this to you
you need to learn who your friends are
you set me up
i taught you a lesson

the cable guy absorbs the blow then goes on the offensive
right now i think youre the one who needs help
im here to give you comfort
the cable guy huts his hand up to the glass
come on touch it
steven just stares at him
you need human contact
i will not touch it
the cable guy stands up and begins unbuttoning his shirt

the cable guy pushes his naked breast against the glass
other prisoners are beginning to stare
smacking the glass stop it
im here for you

the cable guy begins to laugh
as he buttons his shirt i was just messing with your mind
that was from midnight express
oliver stone won the academy award for the screenplay

steven lunges at the glass
stevens guard pulls steven out of the room toward the exit
hey this is the guy who framed me
the cable guy walks to his door
he turns to the guard at the door
warmly louis howd you like that tyson fight on pay per view
i told you its more fun when its free per view
they both laugh
the door closes behind them
the cable guy is sitting at a table wearing a walkman
people look at him funny as he speaks out loud to his lisp tape
revision blue over pronouncing sea shells
robin is brought over to the table by a hostess
the cable guy takes off his walkman and stands up to be polite
he sits down in perfect synch with her
im sorry we have to meet under these circumstances
i know we dont know each other very well but we do have one thing in common our concern for steven
well you were right
somethings happening with him and he wont even acknowledge it
if he refuses to admit he has a problem we may have to let him hit bottom
hes gonna need some tough love
tentatively you know his lawyer said that nobody named ernie douglas works for the cable company
chuckles did he do a name search
cause i work under a pseudonym so the customers wont harass me at home
kind of like a stripper
my real name is larry larry tate
and hes saying he received all the stereo equipment from you
i know and im not mad
hes been cornered so hes telling some wives tales
he doesnt mean to hurt me
i just feel like i triggered this with him
its not that i dont want to get married its just i felt like he wanted to get married just to get married
i dont deal well with pressure
hey welcome to the human race

on the tv hard copys barry nolan sits behind his desk giving a news update
the sam sweet trial has been thrown into chaos as a result of a videotape made a month after the killing
in this hard copy exclusive an apparently intoxicated sam sweet puts on a macabre show for his friends at a party
the judge has not decided whether this tape is admissible as evidence
we see a videotape of sam sweet at a party
the date and time are seen in the corner
sam stands next to the corner of a wall which is completely covered with a mirror
sam gestures with a beer bottle as he looks at his reflection in the mirror
to camera hey everyone

gestures to his reflection my brother stan
waves at reflection hi stan

we pan over to stevens father earl paying bail
im sorry dad

this cost me a lot of money
you jump bail and i swear ill hire a bounty hunter to hunt you down
steven walks into his apartment exhausted from his jail experience
he walks into the living room and sees several new frames on the wall
they are four foot blow ups of polaroid photographs of steven with his arm around the cable guy at the karaoke jam
the photos have been tinted in a stylish fashion
steven angrily runs to the wall and takes them down
steven and robin are walking up the stairs to the front door
they are dressed up for his parents anniversary party
revision ends blue are you sure youre okay

the cable guy walks over
you look great
she gives him a peck on the cheek
and you are a vision
youre looking rested
he pulls the cable guy aside
steven whats with you tonight
im getting some really weird energy from you
maybe its because i just got out of prison where you sent me
i should just drag you to the police right now
you can if you like but id hate to have to show robin this
he takes out a polaroid of steven kissing the hooker
you son of a bitch
the cable gut quickly puts it away
come on steven lets just have a good time tonight
revised blue robin earl and stevens mother walk over
steven your mother and i had a long talk with your friend larry here when he came over to screw in the cable
to the cable guy thank you again for that
beat we owe you an apology
i didnt realize the seriousness of your problems
youre obviously going through some kind of personal hell and i need to be more understanding
we didnt get involved with things like that when i was your age
steven cannot figure out what kind of lie the cable guy has told them
i know we havent been there for you lately but were going to see you through this cause we are a family
i love you
he gives him a big hug
youve got a good friend here
they walk into the next room where the entire family is gathered for pre dinner cocktails
stevens brother pete walks over to steven
he carries a baby in a pouch
winks hey buddy were with you
keep your chin up
as the cable guy charms stevens family we pan across all of the guests laughing and enjoying dinner
so steven is carrying this battle ax and hes chasing me swinging like a mad man
im yelling at him hey its just a show
revision ends blue he always takes things too seriously
tell me something i dont know
this guy almost took my head off
the camera moves to steven
he stares at the cable guy his eyes filled with rage
the cable guy is talking and eating in slow motion
on steven watching him
he is in normal motion
on the cable guy eating in slow motion on steven getting very irritated

tony stevens six year old nephew runs to the cable guy with a toy gun
pow pow pow
youre under arrest
the cable guy starts running around the table
tony makes chase laughing all the way
youll never catch me copper
the cable guy stops grabs a piece of asparagus and puts it between his lip and nose and pretends its a moustache
im gonna wear a disguise
steven looks at the cable guy and remembers something
he sees the cable guy
the artists rendering of the man who beat up robins date appears in front of the cable guys face
steven realizes that they are the same person
steven gets a frightened look on his face
the kid points his gun at the cable guy and yells pow
the cable guy drops to the floor like hes been shot
oh you got me
the cable guy plays dead
the kid walks over to him
when he gets close the cable guy lunges to grab him
devil voice aaah
nobody messes with me and lives
the kid screams with laughter and runs away
the cable guy chases him around the table and out of the room
steven instantly fears for tonys safety
he follows them
steven walks around looking for tony
suddenly from behind a couch tony and the cable guy pop out
steven flies back scared out of his wits
tony and the cable guy start laughing hysterically
they have a grand ol time enjoying their little prank
oh man you should have seen your face
it was classic
tony go to your mother
tony immediately starts crying

the cable guys laughter stops on a dime

stevens mother enters
looks at them my you two look like brothers

cable guy quickly starts walking back to the dining room
happily are you guys trying to fatten me up
cause if you are youre doing a damn good job of it
he laughs and exits
steven slowly follows
everyone is sitting around having coffee
the cable guy is writing words on torn up pieces of paper
you guys have never played porno password
no but i like the sound of it
its the adult version of the popular television game show
robin youre on my team
steven youre with mom
to everyone else youre the audience
the cable guy sits next to robin
steven and his mother sit across from them

steven punches the cable guy in the facem sending him to the floor
all of the women including robin run to help him
to steven i cant believe you
the cable guy gets up
thank you for a delightful evening
to steven i forgive you
everyone looks at steven like he is the devil
you dont understand
everyone walks away from steven
the party is over
robin is venting her anger at steven as they walk to the car
i just think you were completely out of line
i dont know whats happening to you these days
steven gets fed up
robin this guy is a sociopath
he leaves messages on my machine night and day
he shows up wherever i go
he wont leave me alone

and he gave you the free cable
it wasnt me

when we werent communicating
i invited you
you were out on a date
and you were with a prostitute
she seduced me
thats what they do
and i didnt even know she was a prostitute
so that makes it better
thats not the point
the point is this guy has been setting me up
he didnt have sex with a whore
robin you dont i dont want to hear it
breaking up was the best thing we ever did
you have some serious problems and its not my responsibility to help you
i am only responsible for my own happiness
where did that come from
it was jerry springers final thought
rick is running to an editing bay
steven follows him
im sorry ive been blowing you off
you bet your ass youve been blowing me off
its just this guy is really doing a number on me
i told you not to hang out with him
youre the one who told me to offer him money so i could get free cable
you didnt tell me he was a psychopath
beat ill see if i can get my friend in research to track him down
whats his name again
why does that sound so familiar
stevens secretary joan is watching a news report about the sam sweet trial on a mini television
on the tv a female prosecutor gestures with a shotgun as she questions a policeman
joan changes channels
the image changes to larry king interviewing alan dershowitz regarding the abuse excuse
steven walks over to joan
to his secretary did anyone notice im late
what are you talking about youve been here for an hour
steven walks to his office
steven walks behind his desk
he notices something which disturbs him
his computer is on
he clicks a button and a message comes on the screen
then an image comes on the screen
it is black and white surveillance video digitized to the computer format
the video is of robin and steven talking
it is the conversation they had before they watched sleepless in seattle
dont get me started
that guy has no vision
its like working for mr
hes just worthless
its just great that youre getting to do it
its a real step up
now if only someone at corporate smartened up enough to dump hal then i could really get some stuff done
the sccene starts again
it is on a loop
steven is aghast
he looks up and sees the scene is playing on every computer in the office
he gets a panicked look on his face
is hal seeing this
he runs out of his office to prevent hal from viewing this
steven runs to the edge of the stairs and looks down
he sees hal downstairs walking into his office
back to steven he runs down the stairs towards hals office as fast as he can
steven walks in
hal is sitting behind his desk staring angrily at the computer
he looks up and sees steven
i didnt see it cause i have no vision
steven knows whats coming
steven walks to his car carrying a box filled with his belongings
he has been fired
suddenly a car alarm beeps
its headlights flash
then another and another
soon he is surrounded by screaming car alarms and flashing headlights
he looks around in fear
chip this isnt funny
where are you
suddenly they all stop simultaneously and then the only sound is a miniacle laugh echoing through the garage
steven runs to his car and gets in
he drives up the ramp in a panic
from out of nowhere the cable guy steps into the beam of his headlights
he cannot stop in time
the cable guy is thrown into the air then lands on the back of the roof of the car
before he falls off he grabs on to the bar of the luggage rack
steven looks through his rear view window and sees the cable guy staring at him
as steven continues to drive the cable guy climbs on to the roof of the car then jumps on the hood and stares at steven through the windshield
steven swerves around almost losing control of the car
leave me alone
i have no job no girlfriend no family anymore
revised blue menacingly oh no
its not over
its just gettin started
he turns a corner very sharply throwing the cable guy off his car
the cable guy falls to the ground rolling many times then leaps to his feet using the momentum of the roll and runs off scampering like a supernatural bug
on the tv the local news
the jury has notified the judge that they are very close to reaching a verdict and would like to keep deliberating into the evening hours
rick is sitting at his desk
a female researcher walks over and sits down
there are five people named ernie douglas in this county
two are african american
one is eighty five years old
one is eleven years old and the last one is in a wheelchair
so were nowhere
she begins tapping her foot nervously
could you stop that
dont snap at me
im doing this as a favor
he continues staring at her two tone wing tipped style shoe
has an epiphany wait could you start that again
start tapping your foot again
she begins tapping
rick begins humming the theme to my three sons
she joins him
they sing louder and louder
theyve broken the code
revision ends blue the phone rings
steven runs in the front door and picks up the phone
my three sons
chip and ernie douglas
rick sits at his desk
the researcher is at his side
ive got a list of every cable installer fired in the last four years
every one of these guys has the same physical description as our friend
reads from the list murray slaughter brendan walsh sam malone alex reiger
there was even a guy who liked to be called the big ragu
steven walks in and looks for the cable guys hidden camera as he speaks on the phone
carmine from laverne and shirley
thats so sad that you know that
anyway the cable company in town fired a guy six months ago named darren stevens
he stole the truck and disappeared
thats our guy
steven finds a small camera in one of the television speakers
he rips it out
so he doesnt even work for the cable company
quick cuts of steven bolting doors and locking windows
he was fired for beating up a customer who yelled at him for being late
a company in denver thinks they might have a lead on who he really is
if i were you id lock down tonight
ill call you when i get some more info
steven is watching television
he struggles to stay awake
on the tv court tv
the prosecutor in the sam sweet trial is speaking
dont let your memories of these cute twins distract you from the fact that this funny star of a situation comedy killed his own brother in cold blood then called
the police and said he was killed by an asian gang
there was no laugh track on that night
the prosecutors words turn into gibberish as stevens eyes go heavy and he falls asleep
the gibberish turns into clearly spoken words only this time the voice sounds more familiar
on the tv we see the sam sweet trial
a prosecutor makes a passionate final summation
we reveal that it is the cable guy
this man killed his own brother
some people dont even have a brother
the camera pushes in on the cable guys face
he looks to camera
do they steven
are you listening to me
dont shut it off
dont shut it on steven he shuts off the tv and walks out of the room
the entire apartment appears much larger
steven walks down the hallway
he looks into the living room and sees rick
why do you keep icing me man
he opens up a door and sees an elongated version of his bathroom
the shower is steaming
the two eight year old sweet twins stand in front of it looking very spooky
he quickly closes the door
he continues down the hallway and opens the door to the dining room but when he opens it he sees robins bedroom
robin is in bed
a man wearing a cable installers uniform is smothering her with a pillow
the man turns it is steven
he quickly closes the door
he hears someone pounding on the front door
he opens the door
nobody is there
then the cable guy pops into frame holding a cut cord
you owe me
steven slams the door
then looks through the peep hole
the cable guy begins to run full speed at the door
as he does he gets bigger and bigger and more distorted as he come closer to the peephole
he hits the door
then disappears from frame
a moment later he stumbles back into frame then walks to the far end of the hall and runs again to the door even faster
he staggers back into position again
he runs toward the door
steven runs away from the front door
the door smashes open and the cable guy runs after him
steven runs away down the hallway
the hallway appears to be a mile long
he tries to run fast but appears to move in almost slow motion
every time he looks over his shoulder he sees the cable guy running at an alarmingly fast rate of speed toward him grunting like a wolf
he looks back another time and the cable guy is gone
he keeps running and the hallway starts getting smaller and smaller till he can barely fit through
he becomes trapped at the end of the hall
arms come out of the window behind him and grab him
fifty cable guy faces pop out of the wall on both sides
i just want to hang out
no big deal
steven breaks free of the hands and runs into his living room
steven runs in
the television is on
he sits on the edge of the couch not sure what to do
he puts his head down
when he looks up he sees the cable guys face on the television set
the cable guys face stretches out from the television getting larger and larger
steven youre just like me
were cut from the same cloth
were one and the same
then it opens its mouth and swallows steven pulling him into the television
steven wakes up in a cold sweat
panting oh my god
i am a smotherer
im just like him
the phone rings
it didnt have to come to this steven
we could have been blood brothers
rick told me you were fired from the cable company
youre not even a real cable guy
close up of the cable guys face
do you feel good now that youve hurt me
well now im going to have to hurt you
im going to take away what you hold dearest in the world
i swear to god if you touch could you hold on a second ive got call waiting
itll just be a sec
he clicks over
steven just sits there waiting
waiting some more
then the cable guy clicks back
sorry about that
where was i
youre going to feel my wrath
pleading dont do this
there must be some way for us to work this out
i wish there was
losing it oh steven im just so tired
so very tired
lets talk in person
where are you
revised blue im close
so very close
the camera rotates and reveals that the cable guy is actually lying down
then the camera rises up and reveals that the cable guy is lying in the floorboards right underneath steven
a single beam of light shines across his face
as he speaks a large daddy long legs spider crawls across his face
he never acknowledges it
you know i dont think youre right for robin
she needs someone who can be sensitive to her needs
someone who understands her soul
you stay away from her
arent we the control freak
looks like youre starting to sweat
i got the camera
you cant see me
steven begins to pick his face
then why are you picking your face
steven throws the phone
when it lands we see the speaker phone light is on
he begins looking for the camera
he smashes his tv
jump cuts steven tearing through everything in his apartment
youre getting closer
steven overturns a cd rack
pity such a nice cd rack
you know sometimes the answer is right under your nose
steven lloks at the floorboards then runs out of the room and returns a moment later with an ax
he starts chopping at the floorboards tearing the out
he looks down into the hole he sees nothing
then a hand grabs him by the shirt and pulls his face into the space in the floor
the cable guys face appears in front of him screaming like a mad man
he licks stevens face quickly then disappears back into the hole
steven falls back
he hears the cable guy scuttle away
steven sticks his head back down into the hole only to see the dust in the floorboards swirl in the aftermath of the cable guys exit
he hears the cable guy crawling through the walls above him then through the side walls and away into the distance
when it clears he discovers a small makeshift observation room has been set up in the crawlspace
there are a few photos pasted to the floorboards
one shows the cable guy as a child standing next to his mother
stevens picture has been pasted into those photos making him look like the cable guys brother
the only other photo is of jerry springer
steven sees a small television monitor and a set of headphones from which the cable guy has been watching him
he looks at a cellular phone
every speed dial on the back of the phone says steven next to it
steven gets up and runs out of his front door
it is raining lightly outside
steven is in his car
he pulls away quickly
rick sits at his desk
the phone rings
super close up what the audience will think is stevens mouth actually the cable guy speaking on a cellular phone
i need to meet with you right away
ive got some information about this crazy cable guy
ive got the whole story
lets meet at the old school at nine thirty
why all the way out there
i think hes been following me
dont be late buddy
stevens car screeches to a stop
he runs up to robins door and starts knocking
her female neighboor opens her door
i remember you
youre her obsessive boyfriend
she said you might come here
im calling the police
she closers her door
he runs off
rick drives up then walks into the building
rick walks through the school looking for steven
in the distance he sees steven standing in the shadows
im really excited to hear what you found out about this nut
i hit the holy grail
this guy is deeply troubled
his mother was arrested for prostitution and phone solicitation
apparently she was some phone sex pioneer
and get this he was discharged from the marines
he got mad at his sergeant so he sent a weapons silo to defcon two using a radio shack computer
and thats not the half of it
as rick gets closer steven steps forward out of the shadows and we reveal that it is not steven but the cable guy dressed like steven doing a perfect impression
actually the real voice of steven looped into the cable guys mouth with a very slight lisp
tell me more
ricks face turns white
he stumbles backwards trying to get away
im very interested in learning everything i can about that wacked out cable installer
he turns and runs
he is fifteen feet away from the cable guy
the camera pushes in on the cable guy
he pulls out a staple gun and fires
we hear but do not see rick yelp and fall
it sounds like he might hurt somebody
steven is driving in his car
his cellular phone rings
he picks it up
talks like a game show host nosey friends for two hundred
this supposed pal of stevens is currently residing in the intensive care unit of good samaritan hospital
im sorry you didnt answer in the form of a question
he hangs up
stevens car pulls up
he gets out and runs toward the hospital
steven flies through the swinging doors and runs through the hallway of the hospital
he walks up to a doctor
rapid fire rick legatos
hes a friend of mine
where is he
can i see him
but he cant speak
hes in shock
steven enters the room
the camera pulls back to reveal rick laying in full traction face down his rear end heavily bandaged
he is unconscious
steven tentatively walks over to ricks rear end
he pulls back a small portion of the bandage and sees that his butt is covered with staples
the staples form the shape of a television with an antenna
inside the tv is the word ring
the phone rings
steven jumps then picks up the phone
seems he had a little accident with the business end of a staple gun
revision ends blue youre not going to get away with this
the question is are you going to get away with it
apparently there was an anonymous tip placed to the police leading them to a staple gun at the crime scene with your fingerprints all over it
all right im ready
we reveal that the cable guy is at robins apartment
they are getting ready to go out
non psychotic voice be right there
was that robin
psychotic again ive got to go
were going to take a romantic stroll on the information superhighway
steven drops the phone and runs out of the room
steven runs down the hall to the elevator
before he reaches it the doors open and the two policemen who arrested him at work walk out
steven quickly turns left but the policemen see him and make chase
hey hold it
steven runs out of the hospital
the two policemen run after him about twenty feet behind
steven jumps in his car and takes off
the police follow in their car
revised blue stevens car turns a corner and flies down a busy boulevard
a second later the police cars follow with sirens blaring
the cable guy and robin are at the dish
he gives her the same tour he gave steven earlier in the film
it all started in lansford pennsylvania where panther valley television with the assistance of jerrod electronics created the first cable television system
the chase continues
the cable guy and robin are now standing on the edge of the dish
the future is now
soon every american home will integrate their television phone and computer
youll be able to visit the louvre on one channel and watch female mud wrestling on another
you can do your shopping at home or play a game of mortal kombat with a friend in vietnam
the chase continues
steven slams on the gas until he is driving one hundred miles per hour
he weaves in and out of traffic running stop lights and avoiding obstacles
the police cars disappear behind him
on a dime steven turns left onto a residential street and shuts off his lights
a moment later all of the police cars pass by
steven pulls out and heads the other way
this is really fascinating but i really think we ought to go now
i knew youd appreciate it
i took steven here once and he didnt give a rats ass about my interests
im worried about steven
maybe steven should be worried about you
beat so where was i
steven drives his car up the muddy dirt road
it gets stuck in the mud
he gets out of the car and begins walking to the satellite dish which is surrounded by a chain link fence
he hears the sounds of horse hooves coming closer and closer
the he sees a headless man on a horse ride straight toward the fence
the horse has the coat of arms from medieval times
when he reaches it he smashes off the chain with a sword then rides through
the horse rears back on its hind legs
the horse runs full speed directly at steven
at the last possible moment the horse jumps over steven
when the horse stops the cable guy pops his head through the top of his coat
chuckles ichabod crane
the disney channel showed it all last month
the cable guy rides toward him again
like the vegas announcer lets get ready to ruuuuuummmmbbble
revision ends blue this time when he gets near steven he leaps off the horse onto him
they both slam into a puddle of mud
the cable guy punches him in the stomach and then the face
this isnt about robin this is about you and me
steven charges directly at the cable guy
steven tackles him to the ground and begins hitting him
they are both covered in mud like warriors from the rain forest
steven grabs a large rock and holds it over his head
nonchalantly im sorry i didnt catch the question
steven brings down the rock
at the last moment the cable guy moves his head
the rock slams into the ground
steven youve changed
beat then impressed i like it
the cable guy convulses his body pushing steven off him
they wrestle on the ground
the cable guy gets on top of steven then pulls a power drill out of his belt and turns it on
i think its time to make you cable ready
he slowly brings the drill down to steven
steven blindly reaches behind him
he grasps a large branch and bats the cable guy off him
the cable guy grabs a large tree brance and runs towards steven
they begin fighting in a fashion which mirrors their medieval times swordfight
last time we fought i let you win
best two out of three
music up ominous version of the star trek battle music
crazed you treat me like the tv
you use me but you cant live without me
the cable guy smashes steven in the knee with his branch
you cant shut me off with your remote control
im not like robin and rick and mommy and daddy and brother and sister and cousin steven smashes him in the head with the branch
i got the point
the cable guy goes down
he appears to be unconscious
in the distance steven
he looks to the dish but cannot see her
steven climbs over the edge into the dish
below him he sees that the bottom of the dish is filled with several feet of rain water
three wires go from the points on the edge of the dish and meet at a point at the center of the satellite thirty feet above the floor of the
robin is hanging by her bound hands from the center of where those wires meet
steven climbs down towrd the bottom of the dish
help me steven
in the background we see the blurry image of the cable guy climbing through an entry hatch at the top of the dish
robins eyes fill with terror
mimics her yeah steven
the cable guy leaps out of the hatch like a jack in the box
he slides down the dish knocking steven down
the two tumble down the slope of the dish and tumble all the way down into the water
sweetly like a girl ive missed you
the cable guy immediately punches steven sending him back into the water
the cable guy dives on top of him
a moment later the cable guy pulls steven up then grabs his collar and speaks right into his face
dramatically dry land is not a myth ive seen it
kevin costner from waterworld
i dont know what the fuss was about the movie ruled i saw it six times
he pulls steven under the water and tries to hold him there
he pulls him up after a few moments
isnt it weird that wevve wound up in this position
he pushes him under the water again
after a moment he pulls him back up
steven gasps for air
who would have thunk it
enraged steven punches him in the mouth with such tremendous force that it appears to have knocked his jaw out of alignment
without any lisp youre gonna have to do better than that steven
realizing his lisp is gone steven
hey my lisp is gone
steven hits him again this time on the other side of the face
lisping again you stupid son of a bitch
the cable guy falls unconscious
steven runs to her
he runs to the side of the dish
he realizes he must climb up to release her
he climbs onto the wire and begins tightrope walking toward her
he walks very slowly almost losing his balance several times
close on the opposite wire
the cable guys muddy hands slam onto it
he pulls himself up
laughs maniacally i know what your saying
who does this guy think he is jason
stay away from her
suddenly the cable guy does a front flip and lands perfectly on the wire
i saw that in trapeze starring tony curtis
he was just on life styles of the rich and famous
he still looks terrific
steven is about ten feet from the dangling robin but the reverberation from the cable guys landing makes steven lose his balance
he falls over but catches ont the wire
he is left hanging there
the cable guy sees this and begins to run incredibly fast toward robin
and the race is on
he does a cartwheel on the strut hops on one leg then takes off toward her running at full speed
steven left with no other option simply bounces up and down on the wire
robin sees this and joins him
the cable guy begins to lose his balance
knows hes about to fall this is such an anti climactic way to end this
the cable guy loses his balance and falls to the water below
the cable guy has surely met his demise
steven and robin are sitting in the dish a few feet from where the water begins
they are exhausted from their ordeal
they hold each other close
im sorry i didnt believe you
i love you
i love you too
we shouldnt get married
ive got a lot of problems to work out which have absolutely nothing to do with you
well work them out together
suddenly the cable guy pops up from underwater
he looks frightening
then he starts coughing uncontrollably
he looks like a small boy who has swallowed too much water
between coughs what just happened
where am i
remembers oh yeah i was trying to kill you
he leaps at steven and puts him in a head lock
he squeezes until steven passes out
the he lays him on the ground
to robin its a sleeper hold
hulk hogan used it on sly stallone in rocky three
he should wake up in thirty seconds so lets get going
he holds her around the neck and puts a staple gun to her head then walks her out of the dish
steven slowly wakes up
he looks and sees the cable guy and robin beginning to climb up the rdio antenna
he quickly gets up to follow them
the cable guy and robin climb the antenna
steven follows them up from a distance
the cable guy and robin reach a platform at the top of the antenna
the cable guy holds robin with one hand and holds a staple gun to her temple with the other hand
steven climbs onto the platform
he walks with robin to the edge of the platform
there is a one hundred foot drop to the dish below
a police helicopter hovers in the air around them
it didnt have to be this way steven
im just trying to show you the kind of things that can happen when you mistreat people
dont do anything stupid
you know this is just like that secen in that clint eastwood movie dirty harry snaps no
this is not like anything
this is not a movie
were real people
youre hurting us
this is reality
the cable guys eyes turn sad
this hits the cable guy like a sucker punch
dazed he lets go of robin
she runs to stevens arms
from below we hear the sound of sirens
a pack of police cars pull up and surround the antenna
the cable guys expression changes
he begins to look like a scared little boy
if this is reality
he climbs onto the guard railing i am outta here
the cable guy slowly falls backward off the antenna
steven lunges for the cable guy grabbing his forearm then grabbing the antenna with the other hand
youre not going anywhere
the cable guy hangs high above the satellite dish
steven tries to pull the cable guy back onto the platform but the cable guy does not want to be saved
dont do this
you just need help
we all get lonely
yeah but i get really lonely
beat i mean look at me
youre gonna be fine
just come on up
a long beat steven i think i sat too close to the television
mommy was right
steven cant hold onto his forearm any longer
the cable guys arm slips and steven grabs onto his hand at the last possible second
its too late for me but theres a lot of little cable boys out there who still have a chance
say good bye to the baby sitter
revised blue the cable guy stops holding onto stevens hand
he begins falling toward the dish below
long wide shot of the entire antenna
the cable guy falls backward toward the satellite
a nuclear family is watching court tv
on the tv a reporter speaks to the camera from the courthouse
this is the moment america has been waiting for
weve just been told the jury is ready to render their decision
the cable guy sails through the air
as he falls he looks almost peaceful
totally comfortable with what he is doing
a couch potato sits on a fold out bed his eyes glued on the television
on the tv the court clerk is about to read the jurys decision
by unanimous vote the defendant sam sweet
close on the cable guy plummeting toward the dish about to hit
the camera flies through the crowd at the same speed as the cable guy straight into a close up of the television
has been found we hear a loud thud
the screen turns to white noise
revised pink we hear a loud thud
the screen turns to white noise
steven and robin gasp
from below we see the cable guys silhouette motionless on the struts of the satellite dish
a wide panorama of the city
all of the color televisions which can be seen through the many windows of apartments and houses turn to white noise
the television shows white noise
everyone screams at the tv
the cable guy appears dead
the needle of the antenna sticks through his mid section
a red light blinks at the tip of the needle
then the cable guys eyes open
damn that hurt like a mother
what the hell was i thinking
looks at the needle oh man that stings
steven and robin look relieved
a little help here
a pasty white couch potato stares at the white noise not sure what to do
he turns and picks up a book
as music crescendos he begins to read
the cable guy is being taken away on a stretcher toward an emergency helicopter
steven and robin are covered in police blankets
steven calls to a paramedic
is he going to be all right
i dont know
its in gods hands
the paramedics put the cable guy on the helicopter
the helicopter flies away
shot from the helicopter looking down on steven and robin holding each other getting smaller and smaller until they disappear
the cable guy lies in a stretcher next to the paramedic
he is barely conscious struggling for survival
hang in there buddy
stay with me
just stay with me
the cable guys eyes slowly open
he motions for the paramedic to come closer
am i really your buddy
the helicopter flies away
