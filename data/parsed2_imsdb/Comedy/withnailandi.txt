withnail and i withnail and i camden town london
a few shafts of sunlight sneak through the curtains and illuminate a sitting room
there are empty bottles everywhere
i who is smoking a joint gets up somewhat precariously and walks into a kitchen which is full of bottles and dirty washing up
he lights the gas on the stove and puts on the kettle
i knocks on the door to withnails bedroom im having a cup of tea do you want one
he waits for a response
do you want a cup of tea withnail
i leaves the flat slamming the front door behind him the cafe i is reading a paper at a table in the cafe
the proprietor is cooking eggs in a frying pan full of grease
she takes one out inserts it between two slices of bread and places it in front of an elderly woman who inspects it doubtfully and bites into the sandwhich
yolk runs out of the other edge
i turns his attention to his paper
the story is about a transexual the headline love made up my mind i had to become a woman
he looks around at the other customers
i mentally thirteen million londoners have to cope with this and bake beans and allbran and rape and im sitting in this bloody shack and i cant cope with withnail
i must be out of my mind
i must go home at once and discuss his problems in depth
the flat i stumbles up the barely lit stairs looking unwell
withnail emerges from his room holding a bottle and glass and follows him
withnail i have some extremely distressing news
i dont want to hear it
i dont want to hear anything
oh god its a nightmare out there i tell you
withnail pouring some wine weve just run out of wine what are we going to do about it
i dont know
i dont know
i dont feel good
my thumbs have gone weird
im in the middle of a fucking overdose
my hearts beating like a fucked clock
i feel dreadful i feel fucking dreadful
withnail so do i
so does everyone
look at my tongue
a grey yellow sock
sit down for christs sake whats the matter with you
eat some sugar
i goes into the kitchen which is by now full of steam and turns off the kettle
withnail follows him around reading from a newspaper
withnail listen to this
curse of the superman
i took drugs to win medals said top athlete geoff woade
wheres the coffee
withnail reading from the paper in a world exclusive interview year old shot putter geoff woade who weight pounds admitted taking massive doses of anabolic steroids drugs banned in sport
it used to get him bad tempered and act down said his wife
he used to pick on me
but now hes stopped his much better in our sex life and in our general life
i pours water from the kettle into a bowl and goes back into the living room
withnail follows him
withnail my god this huge thatched head with its earlobes and cannonball is now considered sane
geoff woade is feeling better and is now prepared to step back into society and start tossing his orb about
look at him
look at geoff woade
his head must weight fifty pounds on its own
withnail stands infront of a mirror and brushes his long greasy hair with a comb
i sits on the settee and starts drinking the coffee from the bowl using a spoon
withnail imagine the size of his balls
imagine getting into a fight with the fucker
i dont feel good
withnail thats what youd say but that wouldnt wash with geoff
hed like a bit of pleading
add spice to it
in fact hed probably tell you what he was going to do before he did it
im going to pull you head off
oh no please dont pull my head off
im going to pull your head off because i dont like your head
he notives i drinking from the bowl
withnail have you got soup
why didnt i get any soup
coffee withnail why dont you use a cup like any other human being
why dont you wash up occasionally like any other human being
withnail how dare you
how dare you
how dare you call me inhumane
i didnt call you inhumane you merely imagined it
withnail right you fucker im going to do the washing up
he strides towards the kitchen
i jumps over the arm of the settee and stops him
no no you cant
its impossible i swear it
ive looked into in
listen to me listen to me
there are things in there theres a tea bag growing
you havent slept in sixty hours youre in no state to tackle it
wait till the morning well go in together
withnail this is the morning

i think there may be something alive
withnail what do you mean
its possible its possible
withnail brandishing his comb then the fucker will rue the day
he rushes up the the sink
withnail oh christ almighty
synous nicotine based
keep back keep back
the entire sinks gone rotten
i dont know whats in here
he picks up the kettle from the stove then throws it suddenly into the sink
i told you
youve been bitten
withnail burnt burnt the fucking kettles on fire
theres something floating up
withnail with a fork in his hand fork it
no no no i dont want to touch it
withnail you must you must
the poop will boil through the glaze
well never be able to use the dinner service again
he rumages about in a drawer
withnail here get it with the pliers
no no no no no no

withnail thats right put on the gloves

i starts to move things about in the sink rather gingerly
withnail what is it
what have you found
wheres it coming from
im dealing with it
withnail i think weve been in here too long
i feel unusual
i think we should go outside
the park withnail and i walk along a path in the park
withnail this is ridiculous look at me
im thirty in a month and ive got a sole flapping off my shoe
itll get better it has to
withnail easy for you to say lovey

withnail how should i possibly know what we should do
what should we do
get out of it for a while
get into the countryside
im in a park and im practically dead
what goods the countryside
what time is it
withnail fours hours to opening time
god help us
have we got any embrocation
withnail to rub on ourselves you fool
well cover ourselves in deep heat and get up against a radiator
keep ourselves alive until twelve
withnail jesus look at that
apart from a raw potato thats the only solid to have passed my lips in the last sixty hours
i must be ill
the flat i is writting in a notebook on the settee while withnail wonders round wearing his overcoat and his underpants smearing himself with deep heat
i mentally even a stopped clock tells the right time twice a day
and for once im inclined to believe withnail is right we are indeed drifting into the arena of the unwell
making an enemy of our own future
what we need is harmony
stuff like that
withnail wasnt much in the tube
theres nothing left for you
why dont you ask your father for some money
if we had some money we could go away
withnail inspecting a bottle for dregs why dont you ask your father
how can it be so cold in here
its like greenland in here
weve got to get some booze
its the only solution to this intense cold
somethings got to be done
we cant go on like this
im a trained actor reduced to the status of a bum
i mean look at us
nothing that reasonable members of society demand as their rights
no fridges no televisions no phones
much more of this and im going to apply for meals on wheels
what happened to your cigar commercial
withnail thats what i want to know
what happened to my cigar commercial
what happened to my agent
bastard must have died
havent seen gylgod down the labour exchange
why doesnt he retire
he picks up a paper
withnail look at this little bastard
boy lands plumb role for top italian director
of course his does
probably on a tenner a day and i know what for two pound ten a tit and a fiver for his arse
he points accusingly at i
withnail have you been at the controls
what are you talking about
withnail the thermostats
what have you done to them
i havent touched them
withnail then why has my head gone numb
i must have some booze
i demand to have some booze
he lunges towards the mantlepiece where there is a bottle of lighter fluid
i standing up i wouldnt drink that if i were you
withnail why not
because i dont advise it
even the wankers on the site wouldnt drink that
thats worse than meths
withnail nonsense this is a far superior drink to meths
the wankers dont drink it because they cant afford it
he pours the contents of the bottle into his upturned mouth
have you got anymore
i shakes his head
withnail presses forwards and i backs off
withnail liar whats in your toolbox
no we have nothing
withnail liar youve got antifreeze
you bloody fool
you should never mix your drinks
withnail laughs histerically collapses to the floor and emits unpleasant vomitting noises
the street they walk towards a rather rough looking pub the old mother blackcap
withnail all right this is the plan
we get in there and get wrecked
then well eat a pork pie
then we drop a couple of soamser fifties each means well miss out monday but come up smilling tuesday morning
whats that appalling smell
perfume on my boots
i had to scrub the with essence of petunia
the pub withnail moves somewhat precariously to the bar
the pub is a simple affair with a few men sat round at tables drinking
withnail two large gins two pints of cider
ice in the cider
if my father was loaded id ask him for some money
withnail if your father was my father you wouldnt get it
barman there you are lads
withnail chin chin
withnail chinks his glass against the other which i has not picked up yet and downs the gin in one
i follows suit but gags slightly
what about what his name
withnail what about him
why dont you give him a call
withnail what for
ask him about his house
withnail you want me to call what his name and ask him about his house
whats his number
ive no idea ive never met him
withnail well neither have i

give us a tenner and ill give him a bell
get a couple more in
im going for a slash
next to the door to the gents is a rather large irish man sat with his pint and his paper
big irish man ponce i ignores him and goes into the gents
i to himself i could hardly piss straight with fear
he was a man with of an inch of brain whod taken a dislike to me
what had i done to offend him
i dont consciously offend big men like this
and this ones a decided imbalance of hormone in him
get any more masculine than that and youd have to live up a tree
he reads the grafitti i fuck arses who fucks arses
aloud maybe he fucks arses
to himself again maybe hes written this in some moment of drunken sincerity
im in considerable danger in here
i must get out of here at once
he walks back into the bar
big irish man perfumed ponce
withnail is still at the bar
he has made considerable progress with his cider and is eating some snack
withnail youll be pleased to hear montes invited us for drinks
balls to monty were getting out
withnail balls to monty
ive just spent an hour flattering the bugger
theres a man over there doesnt like the perfume
the big one
dont look dont look
were in danger weve got to get out
withnail what are you talking about
ive been called a ponce
withnail turns to address the room in general
withnail what fucker said that
the large irish gentleman in the corner gets up and walks over to them
now he is upright we see he is very large indeed and does not look friendly
big irish man i called him a ponce
and now im calling you one
withnail smiling would you like a drink
big irish man whats your name mcfuck
as he says this he jerks the scarf from around withnails neck
withnail ive a heart condition
ive a heart condition
if you hit me its murder
big irish man ill murder the pair of yers
withnail my wifes having a baby
listen i dont know what my f
he starts to say friend but decides on a better course of action acquaintance did to upset you but its nothing to do with me
i suggest you both go outside and discuss it sensibly in the street
they push past the man and rush to the door
withnail ahhhh out of my way
the bathroom i is in the bath shaving
speed is like a dozen transatlantic flights without ever getting off the plane
you lose you gain
makes no difference so long as you keep taking the pills
but sooner or later youve got to get out because its crashing then all at once the frozen hours melt out through the nervous system and seep out the pores
withnail enters with their lunch from the chippy withnail the bastards
its a miserable cheap cigar and the bastards wont see me
why are we having lunch in here
withnail its dinner and dannys here
how did he get in
withnail i let him in this morning
he lost one of his clogs
hes come in because of the perpetual cold
i hope the buggers sales plummet
ive got your savaloy
i dont want it
withnail then stick it in the soap tray and save it for later
he scrunches up the paper that was holding his chips and puts it in the toilet dont vent spleen on me
im in the same boat
withnail stop saying that
youre not in the same boat
the only thing youre in that ive been in is this fucking bath
head hunter to his friends
head hunter to everybody
he doesnt have any friends
the only people he converses with are his clients and occasionally the police
the purveyor of rare herbs and prescribed chemicals is back
will we never be set free
the flat i comes out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel
danny youre looking very beautiful man
have you been away
peter preached the epistles to the apostles looking like that
have you got any food
mmm as a matter of fact got a savaloy
danny how much is it
you can have it for nothing
danny sniffs the sausage
withnail enters from the kitchen gluing the sole back on his shoe
he is wearing a rather expensive looking suit
danny i see youre wearing a suit
withnail whats it got to do with you
danny no need to get uptight man
i was merely making an observation
i happened to be looking for a suit for the coal man two weeks ago
for reasons i cant really discuss with you the coal man had to go to jamaica
got busted coming back through heathrow had the weight under his fez
we wored out that it would be handycarma for him to get hold of a suit but hes a very low temperature spade the coal man went into court wearing
a kaftan and a bell
this doesnt go down at all well
they can handle the kaftan but they cant handle the bell
so theres this judge sitting there sitting in a cape like fucking batman with this really rather far out looking hat withnail a wig
danny no man this was more like a long white hat
so he looks at the coalman and says whats all this
this is a court man
this aint fancy dress and the coal man looks at him and says you think you look normal your honour
cunt give him two years
i laughs a little
withnail looks on unamuzed
danny im afraid i cant offer you gentlemen anything
thats alright danny
wed decided to lay off for a bit
danny thats what i thought
except for personal use i concur with you
as a matter of fact i was thinking of retiring and going into business withnail scoffing doing what
danny the toy industry
there is a stange looking contraption on the table involving a bottle
withnail thought you were in the bottle industry
danny no man thats a side line
you can have that
instructions are included
my partners got a really good idea for making dolls
his names presuming ed
his sister give him the idea
she got a doll on christmas what pisses itself
danny then youve got to change its draws for it
horrible really but theyre like that the little girls
so were going to make one that shits itself too
withnail shits itself
danny hes an expert
hes building the prototype now
to i whys he behaving so uptightly
withnail because a gang of cheroot vendors consider a hair cut beyond the limit of my abilities danny i dont advise a hair cut man
all hairdressers are in the employment of the government
hair are your aerials
they pick up signals from the cosmos and transmit them directly into the brain
this is the reason bold headed men are uptight
withnail what absolute twaddle
danny has he just been busted
danny then whys he wearing that old suit
withnail old suit
this suit was cut by hawkes of saville row
just because the best tailoring youve ever seen is above you fucking appendix doesnt mean anything
danny dont get uptight with me man
because if you do ill have to give you a dose of medicine and if i spike you youll know youve been spoken to
withnail you wouldnt spike me youre too mean
besides theres nothing invented i couldnt take
danny if i medicined you youd think a brain tumour was a birthday present
withnail i could take double anything you could
danny removing his sunglasses very very foolish words man
hes right withnail
look at him
his mechanisms gone
hes had more drugs than youve had hot dinners
withnail im not having this shag sack insulting me
let him get his drugs out
danny gets a doll out of a bag
danny this doll is extremely dangerous
it has voodoo qualities
danny takes the head off the doll and extracts a handful of pills
danny trade phenodihydrochloride benzelex
street the embalmer
ill swallow it and run a mile
danny cool your boots man
this pills valued at two quid
withnail two quid
youre out of your mind
thats sense withnail
withnail you can stuff it up your arse for nothing and fuck off while youre doing it
danny no need to insult me man
i was leaving anyway
have either of you got shoes
montes house a battered jag pulls up outside montes house and withnail and i get out
there is a rather flash looking open topped rolls parked outside
the sound of a schubert piano sonata comes from the house
withnail montes car
withnail knocks on the door
monte a rather fat effeminate middle aged gentleman opens the door
he is holding a very large fluffy cat and a watering can
monty oh hello
they enter and go into the lounge
monty sit down do
would you like a drink
they sit together on a sette
monty to withnail sherry
to i sherry
monty moves to the sideboard and pours the drinks
withnail lights up yet another cigarette
monty do you like vegetables
ive always been fond of root crops but i only started to grow last summer
i happen to think the cauliflower more beautiful than the rose
withnail chin chin
he drinks the sherry
monty do you grow
monty oh you little traitors
i think the carrot infinitely more fascinating than the geranium
the carrot has mystery
flowers are essentially tarts
prostitutes for the bees
there is youll agree a certain je ne ses quoi oh so very special about a firm young carrot
do help yourselves to another drink
withnail turns and reaches a bottle over from the sideboard
he takes a long swig
whats all this
the mans mad
not only that hes a raving homosexual
there is a yowl from the cat
monte storms back into the room preceded by the cat
monty you beastly little parasite
how dare you
you little thug
how dare you
beastly ungrateful little swine
he deposits his considerable bulk on the other settee facing the first
withnail shall i get you a drink monte
yes please dear boy
you can prepare me a small rhesus negative bloody mary
and you must tell me all the news
i havent seen you since you finished your last film
i smiles wriley to himself
withnail downs the drink he has prepared for himself pours another and starts making the bloody mary for monty
withnail rather busy uncle
tv and stuff
my agents trying to edge me towards the royal shakespeare again
monty oh splendid
withnail hes just had an audition for rep
monty oh splendid
so youre a thespian too
withnail delivers montes drink and sits beside him
withnail monte used to act
monty id hardly say that
its true i crept the boards in my youth but i never had it in my blood and thats what so essential isnt it
theatrical zeal in the veins
alas i have little more that vintage wine and memories
he stands and looks at a photograph on the mantlepiece
monty it is the most shattering experience of a young mans life when he awakes and quite reasonable says to himself he puts his hand on his heart i will
never play the dane
when that moment comes ones ambition ceases
dont you agree
withnail a part i intend to play uncle
monty and youll be marvelous
he starts quoting from hamlet we do it wrong being so majestical
to offer it the show of violence
as monte rambles in the background i steps over to withnail and whispers
hes a madman
any moment now hes going to rush out and get into his tights
withnail ok ok
give me a minute
the house or out
withnail stands and moves over to monte
withnail could i have a word with you monte
monty oh forgive me dear boy forgive me
i was allowing memories to have the better of me
withnail shall i get you a top up
he moves to the sideboard again
monte sits down and reminisces
monty indeed i remember my first agent
dreadful little israelite
four floors up at the charring cross and never a job at the top of them
im told youre a writer too
do you write poems
no i wish i could
its just thoughts really
monty have you published
monty where did you school
withnail he went to the other place monte
monty oh you went to eton
the cat reappears on is chair
monty get that damned little swine out of here
its trying to get itself in with you
its trying for even more advantage
its obsessed with its gut its like a rugby ball now
it will die it will die
he storms around ineffectually
withnail monte monte
monty no dear boy you must leave you must leave
once again that oaf has destroyed my day
withnail listen monte
can i just have a quick word in private
monty oh very well
later they are leaving the house
monty shows them to the door
monty good night my dears
withnail good night monty
monty closes the inner door to the porch behind them
whats all this going off in private business
why did you tell him i went to eton
withnail because it wouldnt have helped if i hadnt
what do you mean by that
withnail showing him the key to the cottage
free to those that can afford it
very expensive to those that cant
the car they leave camden in is battered old jag
withnail still in his suit has a bottle and is clearly drunk
they pass some schoolgirls
scrubber up yours grandad
withnail little tarts they love it
listen im trying to drive this thing as quietly as possible
if you dont shut up well get stopped by the police
the pass a notice anouncing an accident blackspot
withnail look at that look at that
accident black spot
these arent accidents
theyre throwing themselves into the road gladly
throwing themselves into the road to escape all this hideousness
to a pedestrian throw yourselves into the road darling you havent got a chance
somewhat later they join the motorway
withnail at some point or another i want to stop and get hold of a child
what do you want a child for
withnail to tutor it in the ways of righteousness and procure some uncontaminated urine
he takes out the bottle and instructions provided by danny
withnail this is a device enabling the drunken driver to operate in absolute safety
you fill this with piss take this pipe down the trouser and sellotape this valve to the end of the old chap
then you get horrible drunk and they cant fucking touch you
according to these instructions you refuse everything except a urine sample
you undo your valve give them a dose of unadulterated childs piss and they have to give you your keys back
dannys a genius
im going to have a doze
they drive on
later with the light fading they leave the motorway
it becomes clear that the car has only one functioning headlight
still later it is totally dark and raining heavily
i stops and attempts to transfer the single wiper from withnails side of the car to his own but it refuses to come off
he gets back in the car and in shutting the door wakes withnail who looks considerably the worse for wear
withnail are we there
no were not were here and were in the middle of a fucking gale
now youll have to keep a look out your side
if you see anything tell me
get hold of that map
withnail wheres the whisky
withnail ive got a bastard behind the eyes
i cant take aspirins without a drink
wheres the aspirin
probably in the bathroom
withnail you mean weve come out here in the middle of fucking nowhere without aspirins
where are we
withnail how should i know where we are
i feel like a pig shat in my head
now get hold of that map and look for a place called crow crag
the cottage they draw up in a yard and get out of the car
withnail staggers around aimlessly as i gets the baggage from the boot
withnail there must and shall be aspirins
give me the key and get out of the way
withnail if i dont get aspirin i shall die here on this fucking mountainside
they enter the house
i lights a match and finds a lantern which he lights
as the light comes up the inside of the cottage becomes visible
it is rather spartan
withnail christ almighty i looks round a little more thouroughly
he notices a picture of monty on the wall
he looks accross to withnail who is sat dejectedly in a chair
what are you doing
withnail sitting down to enjoy my holiday right now were going to have to approach this scientifically
first thing weve got to do is get this fire alight then we split into two fact finding groups
ill deal with the water and the plumbings you check the fuel and wood situation
a little later withnail re enters the cottage from a rather wet and windy night
he is holding a small stick
withnail the fuel and wood situation
theres nothing out there except a hurricane
this place is uninhabitable
they sit close to the fire which is rather small
give it a chance
its got to warm up withnail warm up
we may as well sit round a cigarette
this is ridiculous
well be found dead in here next spring
he attemps half heartedly to light a cigarette
withnail ive got a blinding fucking headache
got to have heat
he stands and smashes a chair against the floor
a little later the fire is burning considerably higher
withnail problems weve got to keep this bastard burning well weve got enough furniture for tonight
tomorrow we get down that farm and get some logs
withnail this is a mistake i tell you
this is a dreadful mistake
is bedroom i wakes the next morning and gets out of bed
he checks on withnail who is still asleep
he steps outside and walks accross the yard to examine the view
it is quite magnificent
later he is dressed and walks down to the farm
the building is surrounded by an assortment of farmyard junk
he knocks at the door old woman whos there
the door opens cautiously and an old woman peers out inquiringly
old woman what do you want
im a friend of montague withnail
hes lent us his cottage
i wondered if you could sell us some food
eggs and things
she looks blankly at him
what about wood and coal
again he elicits no responce
seeing she is wearing a hearing aid he bends down and talks directly to it
im not from london you know
old woman i dont care where you come from
she slams the door
i walks away
to himself not the attitude id been given to expect from the h e bates novel id read
i thought theyd all be out the back drinking cider discussing butter
clearly a myth
evidently country people and no more receptive to strangers than city dwellers
he walks back to the house and addresses the door
do you think you could tell me where i could buy some coal and wood
old woman youll have to see my son
he runs this farm
where is you son
old woman up in top field
you cant miss him his legs bound in polythyne
the cottage i walks back into the yard outside the cottage slips and falls in the mud
he picks himself up and storms inside
withnail you bastard wake up
he bangs on the ceiling and moves to the sink to wash
oye wake up you bastard youve got to get wood
withnail enters dressed already and wrapped in a blanket
withnail jesus youre covered in shit
i tried to get fuel and wood theres a miserable little pensioner down there wouldnt give it me
withnail where are we going to get it then
theres a man up on the mountain
why hes up there fuck knows but hes up there with a leg bound in polythene you cant miss him hes your man
and have another look in that shed
if you cant find anything bring in the shed
later they are sat down to a simple lunch
how come monty owns such a horrible little shack
withnail no idea
you never discuss your family do you
withnail i fail to see my familys of any interest to you
ive absolutely no interest in yours
i dislike relatives in general and in particular mine
withnail ive told you why
they dont like me being on stage
he stands up and takes a foil from its bracket on the wall and strides up and down in actorly fashion
then they must be delighted with your career
withnail what do you mean
you rarely are
withnail points the sword menacingly although there is a cork on the end
withnail you just wait
just you wait
when i strike they wont know what hit them
he hears a noise from outside
withnail tractor approaching
he goes to the window and knocks his head on the lantern hanging from the ceiling
then get after it
thats the man
they rush out of the cottage and pursue the tractor
withnail hey stop
stop withnail stop stop please
the tractor driver notices them and stops
withnail stop please
they run up to the side of the tractor and address the driver mr parkin
withnail are you the farmer
to i shut up ill deal with this
to parkin weve gone on holiday by mistake
were in this cottage here
are you the farmer
stop saying that withnail of course hes the fucking farmer
to parkin were friends of montague withnail we desperately need fuel and wood
the farmer shakes his head bewildered
montegue withnail you must know him

parkin parkin mr parkin
what happened to your leg
parkin got a randy bull up there

they walk back inside
i claps withnail on the back
back inside withnail removes his boots and places them in the oven attached to the fire
you want to get out the back dont you
get some spuds up
withnail sorry i cant
my boots are in the oven youd go if you had boots
withnail gladly withnail emerges from the back door with polythene bags tied around his feet
he walks into the garden and after a little unearths a potato
withnail ive got one
later the potatoes are peeled and ready to be cooked
i sits reading journeys end while withnail dozes in front of the fire
i hears the tractor once again and goes out to meet parkin
he is there with some logs
how much do we own you
parkin pay us when you come down what about this chicken
parkin s on back back inside i has left the chicken on the table
it is alive and looks round questioningly
he nudges withnail to wake him

withnail i think you ought to kill it instantly in case it starts trying to make friends with us
withnail alright you get hold of ir
ill strangle it
those dreadful beady eyes
they stare you out
withnail its a bloody chicken
just think of it with bacon across its back
right ill deal with this
youll have to get its guts out
later i is washing his hands in the sink having finished getting the chickens guts out
withnail enters with a shotgun and points it at is head
never point guns at people
now what about this roasting dish
what are we going to cook it in
withnail youre the food and plummings man
ive no idea
i wish id found this an hour ago
id have taken great pleasure in gunning this pullet down
he pokes the chicken with the gun
it still has a few feathers
withnail shouldnt it be more bald than that
no it shouldnt
right were going to have to reverse the roles
we can bake the potatoes in the oven and boil this bastard over the fire
he tries to push the chicken into a kettle but it is too large to fit
withnail lets get its feet off no its going to need its feet
he removes the chicken and takes it to the fire
opening the oven he removes withnails steaming boots and points the the brick in the oven
straddle them either side of that
he sits the chicken on the brick
a phonebox i is smoking stood outside the phonebox waiting for withnail
withnail ive already put two shilling pieces in
no i havnt got another
its not my fault if the system doesnt work
he emerges from the phonebox
withnail bitch hung up on me
i fishes around in his pocket and finds a shilling for withnail who goes back into the phonebox and dials

this is ridiculous
i havent been up in a job for three months
im not going to understudy constantine why cant i play the part
this is ridiculous
no im not in london penryth
well what about tv

well lick ten percent of the arses for me
how dare you
he takes out his frustration on the phone hitting it for a while then leaves the phonebox
withnail bastard asked me to understudy constantine in the seagull
im not going to understudy anyone especially that little pimp
anyway i loath those russian plays
always full of women starring out of windows whinning about ducks going to moscow
returning from penryth they walk accross a field
i is carrying some shopping
withnail what do you think to desmond wolf
with respect to what
withnail im thinking of changing my name
too like donald woolfe he hands the bag to withnail and opens a gate
it is clearly marked shut this gate here changeover point
withnail slams the gate behind them but it doesnt fasten
they see parkin on his tractor
withnail do you think hes happier than us
no withnail i suppose happiness is relative
i never thought it would be a polythene bag without the hole in it
parkin turns the tractor towards them stops and runs towards them
whats up with him
parkin shut that gate shut that bull
you didnt shut the gate
parkin shut that gate shut that bull
a bull appears and pushes the gate open
withnail thrusts the bag into is hands and vaults the wall
i is left facing the bull in a narrow corridor between two walls

withnail wants to get down there and have sex with those cows
shut up withnail
parkin just run at it shouting
withnail do as he says start shouting
it wont gore you a coward you are withnail
an expert on bulls you are not
he shouts and throws the shopping in the air
the bull roars i shouts again and runs at it
it turns and retreats to its field
parkin shut that gate and keep it shut
withnail i think an evening at the crow
the fields it is dark
the silloutes of withnail and i appear on the skyline
i narrating if the crow and crown had ever had life it was dead now
it was like walking into a lung
a self sustained nicotin yellow and fly blown lung
its landlord was a retired alcoholic with military pretentions and a complection like the inside of a teapot
by the time the doors opened he was arseholed on rum and got progresively more arseholed until he could take no more and fell over at about twelve o clock
the crow and crown withnail and i are stood at the bar
withnail well have another pair of large scotches
raymond the publican gets the drink and takes the money for them
in opening the till he just avoids falling over
withnail and i suppress laughter
raymond thought i was going for a minute but no mans put me down yet
have you had any training in the martial arts
withnail yes as a matter of i have
before i became a journalist i was in the terretorials
raymond do you know when you first came in here i knew you were a services man

raymond wiping down the bar is clearly leggless
raymond time please gentlemen
i think he means it the door clatters open and a man in a thick coat walks in leans over the bar and helps himself to a beer
i nudges withnail
the man takes an eel from his trousers which wriggles around violently
he strikes its head on the bar and returns it to his trousers
ask him if we can have one withnail what for
so that we can eat it
were fed up with stew they approach the bar
withnail excuse me could we have an eel

there was an empty wine bottle on the ledge
you better wake him breakfast in fifteen minutes
monty the older order changeth giving way to the new and god forfills himself in many ways and soon i suppose i shall be swept away by some vulgar little
my boys we are at the end of an age
we live in a land of weather forcasts and breakfasts that set in
shat on by tories shovelled up by labour
now which of you is going to be a splendid fellow and go down to the rolls for the rest of the wine

he starts putting his polythene bags on
monty what on earth are those
withnail we forgot to bring our wellingtons
monty you mean youve been up here in all this beastly mud and oomska without wellingtons

monty has an apron on and is holding another
monty i brought two of these in case either of you were any good in the kitchen

ive come a very long way to see you both
i mean id love to stay but hes more adament to get back than i am
monty slips the apron over is head and ties it behind him
monty then we must choose our moment and have a word with him
im sure together we could persuade him
now garlic rosemary and salt
i can never touch meat until its cooked
as a youth i used to weep in butchers shops
i moves through to the lounge and looks in the bags of food on the table
i cant find the rosemary
monty cant find the rosemary
im sure we could find it together
he leans accross i in a rather comprimising fashion
perhaps its in the other bag
monty perhaps it is
shall we look
he reaches accross with his other arm cutting of any opatunity of escape
withnail enters with the wine and puts the bags on the table
sherrys in there
monty exits to the kitchen armed with the sherry
what do you mean sorry
whats he doing here
we cant stay he wont leave me alone
withnail alright well get the dinner down then well leave
in the kitchen monty pulls the cork from the sherry and emerges with three different glasses
monty im afraid we must drink from these
i hope their shapes will not offend your palates
withnail chin chin
monty to a delightful weekend in the country
penryth montys car drives into penryth and pulls up in the town centre
withnail and i get out of the car
compared to monty and the car they look rather scruffy
monty i do think you could at least have shaved

get away from the car
he takes out his wallet and hands withnail two fivers
monty now you get the wellingtons

monty drives off withnail couple of blooms
he removes a fiver from withnails hand withnail i think a drink dont you

withnail and i emerge unsteadily from the pub
withnail where is he
i looks accross to some tearooms we want to get in there dont we
eat some cake

they enter the penryth tea rooms
i sits down at a table and starts buttering the bread rolls on the table
withnail still standing points to the table and addresses an elderly waitress miss blennerhassit
withnail alright here
miss b no were closing in a minute
withnail were leaving in a minute
miss b what do you want
he sits down at the table and makes a rather perfunctory examination of the menu
withnail well have tea and cake

she said shed closed

withnail cake and tea

our car has arrived
he pulls back a curtain to reveal that indeed their car has arrived in the form on monty in the rolls
they get up and i staggers out the door withnail were coming back in here
he tries to lean on a convenient post but misses and staggers a bit
he points meaningfully at the various customers as he leaves shutting his coat in the door
the cottage withnail and i are sat inside
there is no sign of monte
i has just finished shaving and is rubbing his face with a towel
where is he
withnail sulking up the hill
he says he wont come down for lunch without an appology
suits me he can eat his fucking radish
unseen monte enters and addresses i monty its all you fault
i beg your pardon monte
monty you lead him astray
oh dont pretend you dont understand i know what youre up to
withnail stands up and offers monte a glass withnail sherry
oh no no no no
ill fall straight into his trap
hes so mauve we dont know what hell do next
i walks out in distgust as monte sips the sherry
the kitchen i is at the sink peeling potatoes
monte enters monty im preparing myself to forgive you
i think youve been punished enough
i think we better release you from the legume and transfer you talents to the meat
he takes him by the hand into the lounge monty you shouldnt treat each other so badly
hes been working his fingers to the bone and all you do is sit in here drinking
now hes going to revitalize himself in here while you finish the vegtables
withnail i dont know how to do them
monty well of course you dont
youre incapable of indulging in anything but pleasure am i not right
i merely smiles monty you dont deserve such loyalty
now come along im going to teach you how to peel a potato
he rolls up withnails sleeves and takes him unwillingly into the kitchen
withnail swipes a glass of sherry off the table on the way there
the dinner table all three are sat around the table eating a good looking roast dinner
there is plenty of extra meat and a good supply of wine
monty its very stimulating getting back to a basic sort of lifestyle
without effecened emotion and poisonous inhibition
except the problem do tend to take the edge off it
monty what do you mean
there are no proper facilities monty all the glorious trials of youth dear boy
when i was a lad id rocket off on my tandem with wrigglesworth and ride and ride
find some old barn and fall asleep with the sweet perfume of hay on our lips
withnail would it be in poor form to plagarise a toast
monty it depend entirely on the quality of the wine
in this case it most certainly would not
withnail in that case to a delightful weekend in the country
monty oooh we were expecting a volley of argument concerning mr redgrave
i gives withnail a look of daggers youre forgetting jake
monty jake can wait too
jakes not a friend monte
id hoped to avoid telling you this but theres a madman on the loose outside
monty is this true
withnail well theres this local type
we got into a bit of a tiff and he threatened me with a dead fish
yes it was rather amusing acutally
when you came into the house we thought it was him and we thought that you cleaning your boots was him sharpening the knife
monty oh how delicious
im going for a walk
monty oh wait for us dear boy well all go
outside the cottage i is leaning on the wall
withnail emerges and walks briskly over to him withnail look i know what your thinking but i had no alternative
the old beggers come a long way and i didnt want to put the wind up him
you sensitivity overwhelms me
if you think youre having a weekends indulgence up here at his expense which means him having a weekends induldgence up here at my expense youve got another thing coming
withnail anyway he sent me out to say the coffees ready
i couldnt drink it
ive got a crick in my mouth from grinning
withnail well stop smilling at him
i cant help it im so uptight with him
the are walking through thick bracken listening to monte expound on oxford
monty longtemps longtemps de teau cheveux
brings back such memories of oxford
i voice over followed by yet another anecdote about his sensitive crimes in a punt with a chap called norman who had ref hair and a poetry book stained with
the butter drips from crumpets
monty indeed i often wonder where norman is now
probably wintering with his mother in guilford a cat rain vim under the sink and both bars on
but old now there is no true beauty without decay
withnail legium pro britania monty how right you are how right you are
we live in a kingdom of rains reigns where royalty comes in gangs
come on lads the skys bruising night must fall and we shall be forced to camp
hes having my room
i want the room with the lock
agree to that or im off
withnail alright alright they stride off back to the cottage
before they get there they see jake at the door
monte looks at him through the binoculars good old jake eh
and thats precisely the reason im off back to london
come on lets pack up and get off
good old jake eh withnail
lets all have a laugh
good old jake
monty hes going away
they walk down to the cottage
there is a hare tied to the door with a note attached
withnail unfolds the note and hands it to monte
monty clearly has some difficulty in reading the note
monty here hare here
the meaning dawns on him
monty here hare here
withnail good old jake
they are playing poker with bottle tops and a few coins
an old gramaphone is plaing in the background
the game is stud with two down cards monty has the ace of spades and two small spades showing i just queen high monty ace bets two and its over
withnail you two and up two
so thats four
monty thats four
i puts in four
monty deals the last set of cards

he deals i another queen to i monty oh there she is
he deals himself another spade monty a possible flush

monty another hand
withnail looks up and slumps in his chair
he is totally plastered
monty i think wed better get him to bed

monty i wouldnt dream of depriving the poor fellow of his bed
particularlly in that condition
its what he wants
withnail no i dont i want to get to bed
come on then luvy lets get you to bed then
a good nights sleep will do us both some good
he grabs withnail under the arms and manouvers him out of the room
well ill say good night then monty
withnail i want to be alone
i staggers up the stairs with withnail who mumers about wanting to be on his own
he drops him on the bed and dashes back to his own room to get his bedding
before he can get back though monty has come up the stairs and just finished locking the door
monty he doesnt want to sleep with you
right then youre in there and ill take the couch
ill say night night then monty
monty you already have
downstairs i frantically aranges the blankets on the settee
monty enters what is it monty im terribly tired i need to get to bed
monty but not that tired eh
are you a sponge or a stone
i beg you pardon monty
monty do you like to sample all facets of life or do you shut yourself off from new experience
i voted conserative monty loyalty isnt a matter of selection
i quite agree its more a matter of chosing to whom one is loyal
im terribly tired monty i need to get to bed
monty you must mustnt you
off you go then
ill sleep down here
it wont be the first time ive been left with the couch
i is in bed
he has barricaded the door by propping a chair against the knob
there is a determined pushing at the door from the other side which dislodges the chair and monty enters
i know youre not asleep boy
but he is
ive been into his room
he wont hear a thing
no im not asleep
what is it monty what do you want
i lights a candle
monty sits down on the side on the bed
monty i tried not to come oh how i tried not to
theres something ive got to tell you monty
monty theres no need to explain hes told me everything
whats he told you
monty about how you came to chelsea and you arrest in the totenham court road
he told me about your probelms how you feel

its like a tide
dont let it ruin your youth as i nearly did over eric
im not homosexual monty monty yes you are
of course you are
youre only saying that to deny your relationship with him
its not his fault that he cant love you any more that its mine that i adore you
cant we allow ourselves this one moment of indiscretion
he need never know
i dont care what he knows you must leave monty
i gets out of bed and goes over to the door
monty beats him to it
monty i mean to have you even if it must be burgulary
i races to the other side of the room
monty you must listen
were in an affair we have been for years
but hes estranged he wont allow himself to admit it
thats why hes rejecting me while youre here
on my life monty this is the first time in six years we havnt slept together
i couldnt cheat on him it would kill him
monty oh my dear boy if id realised that id never have attempted to come between you
i know that monty i respected you for your sensitivity i thank you for it
monty you better go to him oh i intend to
withnails room withnail is asleep in bed with the shotgun
i enters withnail you bastard wake up

ive just narrowly avoided having a buggery
and ive come in here with the express intention of wishing one on you
that said im leaving for london
withnail hold on hold on
dont let you imagination run away with you
he light up and coughs up some phlem ive just finished fighting a naked man
how dare you tell him im a toilet trader
withnail tatical necessity
if i hadnt told him you were active wed never have got the cottage
i wouldnt have wanted it not with him in it
withnail i never thought hed come all this way

withnail calcualted risk
what is all this calculated risk and tactical necessity
its me naked in a corner
and how dare you tell him i love you
and how dare you tell him you rejected me
how dare you tell him that
withnail sorry about that got a bit carried away
sort of said it without thinking
i takes the gun well let me tell you something withnail if he comes in my room again its murder and youll be held resposible in law
the cottage withnail is eating lunch at the table
i is reading a note perhaps it is just that the evesdropper should leave as his trade dictates in secrecy and in the dead of night
i do sincerely hope that you will find the happiness that has saddly always been denied me
yours faithfully montegue h withnail
poor old bastard
withnail now i must say that represents a level of hippocrasy in you that id previously suspected but not noticed due to highly evasive skills
youll suffer for this withnail
what you have done will have to be paid for
withnail ill say one thing for monte he keeps a sensational cellar
there is a knock at the door
who is it
i gets the telegram and opens it
he shows it to withnail withnail well done
well it doesnt mean to say ive got the part
they probably just want to see me again
well that settles it we leave immediately
get you stuff together we leave in half an hour
withnail dont be ridiculous i need at least an hour for lunch
the car withnail is eating the lunch from a plate on his knee
it is raining heavinly and is side of the windscreen is impossible to see through withnail you got a truck coming up in this lane followed by a slow right
this is insanity withnail stay in this lane what lane i cant see any lane
withnail bear right bear right
i cant keep this up
and i must get some sleep
the car it is daytime again and the rain has stopped
i is asleep in the back on the car
the car jerks around and he woken
as he looks out the window the camera moves with his view
the car is hurtling down the motorway swerving between the other cars
whats going on
withnail im making time
pull over you havent got a license
withnail no im making time
here comes another fucker
they swerve infront of several more cars
then i sees a police van behind them
withnail its perfectly alright leave him to me
youre full of scotch you silly tool
the police van comes along side them and a policeman leans out pointing markedly to the roadside
withnail pulls over the van draws up in front on them and the officers approach the car
one knocks on the window and withnail winds it down
p bit early in the morning for festivities isnt it sir
there is a large pile of bottles on the passenger seat of the car withnail theyre not mine they belong to him
p youre drunk
withnail i assure you im not officer ive only had a few ales
p out of the car
withnail makes no move so he opens the door
withnail virtually falls out then stands against the car
the policeman offers him a breathaliser p would you fill this bag please sir
withnail shakes his head p are you refusing to fill this bag
withnail i most certainly am p im placing you under arrest
withnail dont be ridiculous i havent done anything
listen my cousins a qc
p get in the back on the van
police station withnail is behind a screen
a sergant is sat at a desk while other policemen wonder around p serg whats that clown up to
the sergent pulls a gap in the screen and sees withnail with the contraption danny gave him
he grabs the tube and urine splashes everywhere
withnail grins sheepishly the flat withnail and i enter their flat
they look through the post withnail wheres our checks
we didnt sign on
withnail that wouldnt make any difference to last weeks payments
they hear music from upstairs
the door to the bathroom is ajar and in the bath is a large black man who looks at them inquiringly
i looks in his bedroom
the bed is occupied by danny what are you doing in my bed
d having a sleep
whos the huge spade in the bath
d presuming ed
well i want you out
youve got ten minutes alright
coz i want to get in
the lounge all four are sat in the lounge withnail how did you get in
d inginuity man come up the drainpipe
would you like a smoke
withnail yes no thanks ive got a call to make
danny starts pulling out rizzlers at a prolific rate withnail what are you going to do with those
d the joint i am about to roll requires a craftsman and can utalise up to twelve spliffs
it is called a camberwell carrot
its imposible to use papers on one joint
d it is impossible to roll a camberwell carrot with anything less
withnail who says its a camberwell carrot
d i do
i invented it in camberwell and its shaped like a carrot
cut to danny on the settee
the camberwell carrot is complete and is indeed of prodidiuos proportions
as danny lights it we see only the end but as he hands it to withnail we see the true size
it is enormous
d these will tend to make you very high
withnail takes a long draw d this grass is the most powerfull in the western hemisphere
it grows at exactly two thousand feet above sea level
i have it special flown in from my man in mexico

and continue getting higher
thats politics man
we are at the end of an age
the greatest decade in the history of mankind is nearly over
theyre selling hippy wigs in wolworths

withnail because i want to walk you to the station
no really i really dont want you to
they stop by the wolves
i shall miss you withnail
withnail ill miss you too
withnail walks to the fence and leans against it
withnail i have of late but wherefore i know not lost all my mirth and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems
to me a sterile promotory this most excellent canopy the air look you this mighty orehanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appeareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours
what a piece of work is a man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties how like an angel in aprehension how like a god
the beauty of the world paragon of animals and yet to me what is this quintessence of dusk
man delights not me no nor women neither nor women neither
the wolves are unimpressed
withnail exits into the rain
