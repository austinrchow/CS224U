diamond by billy wilder and i
diamond a mans hand is punching out a series of figures on the keyboard
on november first the population of new york city was
if you laid all these people end to end figuring an average height of five feet six and a half inches they would reach from times square to the outskirts
of karachi pakistan
i know facts like this because i work for an insurance company its a big mother covering a square block in lower manhattan all glass and aluminum jutting into the
consolidated life of new york
we are one of the top five companies in the country last year we wrote nine point three billion dollars worth of policies
our home office has employees which is more than the entire population of natchez mississippi of gallup new mexico
acres of gray steel desk gray steel filing cabinets and steel gray faces under indirect light
one wall is lined with glass enclosed cubicles for the supervisory personnel
it is all very neat antiseptic impersonal
the only human tough is supplied by a bank of ibm machines clacking away cheerfully in the background
i work on the nineteenth floor ordinary policy department premium accounting division section w desk number
like every other desk it has a small name plate attached to the side
this one reads c
my name is c
for calvin c
for clifford however most people call me bud
ive been with consolidated life for three years and ten months
i started in the branch office in cincinnati then transferred to new york
my take home pay is
a week and there are the usual fringe benefits
baxter is about thirty serious hard working unobtrusive
he wears a brooks brothers type suit which he bought somewhere on seventh avenue upstairs
there is a stack of perforated premium cards in front of him and he is totaling them on the computing machine
he looks off
with a click the minute hand jumps to and a piercing bell goes off
the hours in our department are to instantly all work stops
papers are being put away typewriters and computing machines are covered and everybody starts clearing out
within ten seconds the place is empty except for bud baxter still bent over his work marooned in a sea of abandoned desks
theyre staggered by floors so that sixteen elevators can handle the employees without a serious traffic jam
as for myself i very often stay on at the office and work for an extra hour or two especially when the weather is bad
its not that im overly ambitious its just a way of killing time until its all right for me to go home
you see i have this little problem with my apartment bud wearing a weather beaten ivy league raincoat and a narrow brimmed brown hat comes walking slowly down the street
skirting the puddles on the sidewalk
he stops in front of a converted brownstone looks up
i live in the west sixties just half a block from central park
my rent is a month
it used to be eighty until last july when mrs
lieberman the landlady put in a second hand air conditioning unit
the windows on the second floor are lit but the shades are drawn
from inside drifts the sound of cha cha music
its a real nice apartment nothing fancy but kind of cozy just right for a bachelor
the only problem is i cant always get in when i want to
what used to be the upstairs parlor of a one family house in the early s has been chopped up into living room bedroom bathroom and kitchen
the wallpaper is faded the carpets are threadbare and the upholstered furniture could stand shampooing
there are lots of books a record player stacks of records a television set inches and payments unframed prints from the museum of modern art picasso braque klee tacked up
on the walls
only one lamp is lit for mood and a cha cha record is spinning around on the phonograph
on the coffee table in front of the couch are a couple of cocktail glasses a pitcher with some martini dregs an almost empty bottle of vodka a soup bowl
with a few melting ice cubes at the bottom some potato chips an ashtray filled with cigar stubs and lipstick stained cigarette butts and a womans handbag
kirkeby a dapper middle aged man stands in front of the mirror above the fake fireplace buttoning up his vest
he does not notice that the buttons are out of alignment
calling off come on sylvia
its getting late
sylvia a first baseman of a dame redheaded and saftig comes cha cha ing into the room trying to fasten a necklace as she hums along with the music
she dances amorously up to kirkeby
cut it out sylvia
we got to get out of here
he helps her with the necklace then turns off the phonograph
whats the panic
im going to have another martooni
she crosses to the coffee table starts to pour the remnants of the vodka into the pitcher
its a quarter to nine
dropping slivers of ice into the pitcher first you cant wait to get me up here and now rush rush rush
makes a person feel cheap
sylvia sweetie its not that but i promised the guy id be out of here by eight oclock positively
pouring martini what guy
whose apartment is this anyway
exasperated whats the difference
some schnook that works in the office
bud is pacing back and forth throwing an occasional glance at the lit windows of his apartment
a middle aged woman with a dog on a leash approaches along the sidewalk
she is mrs
lieberman the dog is a scottie and they are both wearing raincoats
seeing them bud leans casually against the stoop
good evening mr
good evening mrs
some weather were having
must be from all the meshugass at cape canaveral
she is half way up the steps you locked out of your apartment
just waiting for a friend
good night mrs
good night mr
she and the scottie disappear into the house
bud resumes pacing his eyes on the apartment windows
suddenly he stops the lights have gone out
kirkeby in coat and hat stands in the open doorway of the darkened apartment
come on come on sylvia
sylvia comes cha cha ing out wearing an imitation persian lamb coat her hat askew on her head bag gloves and an umbrella in her hand
some setup you got here
a real honest to goodness love nest
he locks the door slips the key under the doormat
still cha cha ing youre one button off mr
she points to his exposed vest
kirkeby looks down sees that the buttons are out of line
he starts to rebutton them as they move down the narrow dimly lit stairs
you got to watch those things
wives are getting smarter all the time
bernheim in the claims department came home one night with lipstick on his shirt told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch so she took it out to
the lab and had it analyzed so now she has the house in great neck and the children and the new jaguar dont you ever stop talking
bud standing on the sidewalk sees the front door start to open
he moves quickly into the areaway almost bumping into the ashcans stands in the shadow of the stoop with his back turned discreetly toward kirkeby and sylvia as they come
down the steps
where do you live
i told you with my mother
where does she live
a hundred and seventy ninth street the bronx
all right ill take you to the subway
like hell you will
youll buy me a cab
why do all you dames have to live in the bronx
you mean you bring other girls up here
im a happily married man
they move down the street
bud appears from the areaway glances after them then mounts the steps goes through the front door
there are eight mailboxes
bud opens his takes out a magazine in a paper wrapper and a few letters proceeds up the staircase
bud glancing through his mail comes up to the door of his apartment
as he bends down to lift the doormat the door of the rear apartment opens and mrs
dreyfuss a jovial well fed middle aged woman puts out a receptacle full of old papers and empty cans
bud looks around from his bent position
hello there mrs
something the matter
i seem to have dropped my key
faking a little search oh here it is
he slides it out from under the mat straightens up
such a racket i heard in your place maybe you had burglars
oh you dont have to worry about that nothing in there that anybody would want to steal
unlocking door quickly good night mrs
he ducks into the apartment
bud snaps on the lights drops the mail and the key on a small table looks around with distaste at the mess his visitors have left behind
he sniffs the stale air crosses to the window pulls up the shade opens it wide
now he takes off his hat and raincoat gathers up the remains of the cocktail party from the coffee table
loaded down with glasses pitcher empty vodka bottle ice bowl and potato chips he starts toward the kitchen
the doorbell rings
bud stops undecided what to do with the stuff in his hands then crosses to the hall door barely manages to get it open
kirkeby barges in past him
the little lady forgot her galoshes
he scours the room for the missing galoshes
kirkeby i dont like to complain but you were supposed to be out of here by eight
i know buddy boy i know
but those things dont always run on schedule like a greyhound bus
i dont mind in the summer but on a rainy night and i havent had any dinner yet sure sure
look kid i put in a good word for you with sheldrake in personnel
perking up mr
we were discussing our department manpower wise and promotion wise finds the galoshes behind a chair and i told him what a bright boy you were
theyre always on the lookout for young executives
thank you mr
starting toward door youre on your way up buddy boy
and youre practically out of liquor
eichelberger in the mortgage loan department last night he had a little halloween party here well lay in some vodka and some vermouth and put my name on it
you still owe me for the last two bottles ill pay you on friday
in the open doorway and whatever happened to those little cheese crackers you used to have around
he exits shutting the door
making a mental note cheese crackers
he carries his load into the kitchen
the kitchen is minute and cluttered
on the drainboard are an empty vermouth bottle some ice cube trays a jar with one olive in it and a crumpled potato chip bag
bud comes in dumps his load on the drainboard opens the old fashioned refrigerator
he takes out a frozen chicken dinner turns the oven on lights it with a match rips the protective paper off the aluminum tray and shoves it in
now he starts to clean up the mess on the drainboard
he rinses the cocktail glasses is about to empty the martini pitcher into the sink thinks better of it
he pours the contents into a glass plops the lone olive out of the jar scoops up the last handful of potato chips toasts an imaginary companion and drinks up
then he pulls a wastebasket from under the sink
it is brimful of liquor bottles and bud adds the empty vodka and vermouth bottles and the olive jar
picking up the heavy receptacle he carries it through the living room toward the hall door
the door of buds apartment opens and bud comes out with the wastebasket full of empty bottles
just then dr
david dreyfuss whose wife we met earlier comes trudging up the stairs
he is a tall heavy set man of fifty with a bushy mustache wearing a bulky overcoat and carrying an aged medical bag
good evening baxter
had a late call
some clown at schraffts th street ate a club sandwich and forgot to take out the toothpick
sets down wastebasket bye doc
indicating bottles say baxter the way youre belting that stuff you must have a pair of cast iron kidneys
oh thats not me
its just that once in a while i have some people in for a drink
as a matter of fact you must be an iron man all around
from what i hear through the walls you got something going for you every night
im sorry if it gets noisy sometimes theres a twi night double header
shaking his head a nebbish like you
well see you doc
starts to back through door you know baxter im doing some research at the columbia medical center and i wonder if you could do us a favor
when you make out your will and the way youre going you should would you mind leaving your body to the university
im afraid you guys would be disappointed
good night doc
slow down kid
he starts into the rear apartment as bud closes the door
bud loosening his tie goes into the kitchen opens the oven turns off the gas
he takes a coke out of the refrigerator uncaps it gets a knife and fork from a drawer and using his handkerchief as a potholder pulls the hot aluminum tray
out of the oven
he carries everything out into the living room
in the living room bud sets his dinner down on the coffee table settles himself on the couch
he rears up as something stabs him reaches under his buttocks pulls out a hairpin
he drops it into an ashtray tackles his dinner
without even looking he reaches over to the end table and presses the remote tv station selector
he takes a sip from the coke bottle his eyes on the tv screen across the room
the picture on the tv set jells quickly
against a background of crisscrossing searchlights a pompous announcer is making his spiel
from the worlds greatest library of film classics we proudly present fanfare greta garbo john barrymore joan crawford wallace beery and lionel barrymore in fanfare there is an extended fanfare
bud leans forward chewing excitedly on a chicken leg
but first a word from our sponsor
if you smoke the modern way dont be fooled by phony filter claims bud still eating automatically reaches for the station selector pushes the button
a new channel pops on
it features a western cockamamie indians are attacking a stagecoach
thats not for bud
he switches to another station
in a frontier saloon gower street cowboys are dismantling the furniture and each other
bud wearily changes channels
but he cant get away from westerns on this station the u
cavalry is riding to the rescue
will they get there in time
bud doesnt wait to find out
he switches channels again and is back where he started
on the screen once more is the announcer standing in front of the crisscrossing searchlights
and now grand hotel starring greta garbo john barrymore joan crawford bud is all eyes and ears again wallace beery and lionel barrymore
but first a word from our alternate sponsor
unctuously friends do you have wobbly dentures
that does it
bud turns the set off in disgust
the tv screen blacks out except for a small pinpoint of light in the center which gradually fades away
in the bathroom bud in pajamas by now is brushing his teeth
from the shower rod hang three pairs of socks on stretchers
bud takes a vial from the medicine shelf shakes out a sleeping pill washes it down with a glass of water
he turns the light off walks into the bedroom
in the bedroom the single bed is made and the lamp on the night table is on
bud plugs in the electric blanket turns the dial on
then he climbs into bed props up the pillow behind him
from the night table he picks up the magazine that arrived in the mail slides it out of the wrapper opens it
its the new issue of playboy
bud leafs through it till he comes to the piece de resistance of the magazine
he unfolds the overleaf glances at it casually refolds it then turns to the back of the magazine and starts to read
what he is so avidly interested in is the mens fashion section
there is a layout titled what the young executive will wear with a sub head reading the bowler is back
illustrating the article are several photographs of male models wearing various styles of bowlers
bud is definitely in the market for a bowler but somehow his mind starts wandering
he turns back to the overleaf again unfolds it studies it then holds the magazine up vertically to get a different perspective on the subject
by now the sleeping pill is beginning to take effect and he yawns
he drops the magazine on the floor kills the light settles down to sleep
the room is dark except for the glow from the dial of the electric blanket
then the phone jangles shrilly in the living room
bud stumbles groggily out of bed and putting on his slippers makes his way into the living room
he switches on the light picks up the phone
yes this is baxter
on the night is a hearty man of about forty five nothing gut personality most of it obnoxious
his name is dobisch
outside the booth is a blonde babe slightly boozed and beyond there is a suggestion of the packed smoky joint
hiya buddy boy
im in this bar on sixty first street and i got to thinking about you and i figured id give you a little buzz
well thats very nice of you but who is this
dobisch joe dobisch in administration
snapping to attention oh yes mr
i didnt recognize your voice thats okay buddy boy
now like i was saying im in this joint on sixty first and i think i got lucky glances toward blonde shes a skater with the ice show he chuckles
and i thought maybe i could bring her up for a quiet drink
im sorry mr
you know i like to help you guys out but its sort of late so why dont we make it some other time
buddy boy she wont keep that long not even on ice
listen kid i cant pass this up she looks like marilyn monroe
i dont care if it is marilyn monroe im already in bed and ive taken a sleeping pill so im afraid the answer is no
pulling rank look baxter were making out the monthly efficiency rating and im putting you in the top ten
now you dont want to louse yourself up do you
of course not
but how can i be efficient in the office if i dont get enough sleep at night
its only eleven and i just want the place for forty five minutes
the blonde opens the door of the phone booth leans in
im getting lonely
who are you talking to anyway
thats real sweet
dobisch shuts the door in her face
into phone again make it thirty minutes
what do you say bud
a last stand im all out of liquor and theres no clean glasses no cheese crackers no nothing
let me worry about that
just leave the key under the mat and clear out
into phone resigned yes mr
he hangs up shuffles back into the bedroom
muttering to himself anything you say mr
dobisch no trouble at all mr
dobisch be my guest he reappears from the bedroom pulling his trousers on over his pajama pants
we never close at buddy boys looks like marilyn monroe he chuckles a la dobisch putting on his raincoat and hat bud opens the hall door takes the key from
the table shoves it under the doormat
his eyes fall on the dreyfuss apartment and there is some concern on his face
he picks up a pad and pencil from the table prints something in block letters
tearing off the top sheet he impales it on the spindle of the phonograph then walks out closing the door behind him
the note reads bud comes out the door in slippered feet pants and raincoat over his pajamas
as he sleep walks down the steps a cab pulls up in front of the house
bud ducks discreetly into the areaway
dobisch bareheaded emerges cautiously from the cab
between the fingers of his hands he is carrying four long stemmed glasses brimful of stingers
the blonde steps out holding his hat
this the place
to cab driver how much
dobisch his hands full of stingers turns to the blonde indicates his pants pocket
get the money will you
the blonde plants the hat on top of his head unbuttons his overcoat reaches into his pants pocket
as she does so she jogs his elbow
watch those stingers
the blonde has taken out dobischs money clip with about a hundred dollars in it
give him a buck
the blonde peels a bill off hands it to the cabbie hangs on to the rest of the roll just a second too long
now put it back honey
she does atta girl
the cab drives off
dobisch and the blonde start up the steps to the house
you sure this is a good idea
cant think of a better one
holding door open for him i mean barging in on your mother in the middle of the night
edging past her with stingers dont worry about the old lady
one squawk from her and shes out of a job
in the areaway bud has overheard them and it doesnt make him any happier
he steps out on the sidewalk shuffles down the street
the blonde and dobisch his hands full of stingers come up to buds door
get the key will you
automatically she reaches into his pocket
under the mat
puzzled under the mat
picks up key impatiently open up open up we havent got all night
the blonde unlocks the door to the apartment opens it
suspiciously so this is your mothers apartment
sticking her head in hiya ouspenskaya
dobisch nudges her inside with his knee kicks the door shut behind him
the landing is empty for a second
then the door of the rear apartment opens and dr
dreyfuss in a beaten bathrobe sets out a couple of empty milk bottles with a note in them
suddenly from buds apartment comes a shrill female giggle
then the cha cha music starts full blast
calling to his wife off screen mildred hes at it again
shaking his head he closes the door
bud in raincoat and slippered feet turns in off the street plods along a path in the deserted park
he stops at a damp bench under a lamp post sits
in the background lights shine from the towering buildings on central park south
bud huddles inside his raincoat shivering
he is very sleepy by now
his eyes close and his head droops
a gust of wind sends wet leaves swirling across the bench
bud doesnt stir
he is all in
its a quarter to nine of a gray november morning and work bound employees are piling in through the doors
among them is bud bundled up in a raincoat hat heavy muffler and wool gloves and carrying a box of kleenex
he coughs pulls out a tissue wipes his dripping nose
he has a bad cold
the lobby is an imposing marbled affair as befits a company which last year wrote
billion dollars worth of insurance
there are sixteen elevators eight of them marked local floors and opposite them eight marked express floors
the starter a uniformed valkyrie wielding a clicker is directing the flow of traffic into the various elevators
bud joins the crowd in front of one of the express elevators
also standing there is mr
kirkeby reading the herald tribune
hoarsely good morning mr
as if he just knew him vaguely oh how are you baxter
they keeping you busy these days
they are indeed
he sniffs the elevator doors open revealing the operator
she is in her middle twenties and her name is fran kubelik
maybe its the way shes put together maybe its her face or maybe its just the uniform in any case there is something very appealing about her
she is also an individualist she wears a carnation in her lapel which is strictly against regulations
as the elevator loads she greets the passengers cheerfully
rattling it off morning mr
kessel morning miss robinson morning mr
kirkeby morning mr
williams morning miss livingston morning mr
mckellway morning mr
pirelli morning mrs
schubert interspersed is an occasional morning miss kubelik from the passengers
morning miss kubelik
he takes his hat off he is the only one
the express is now loaded
working the clicker thats all
take it away
shutting the door watch the door please
bud is standing right next to fran as the packed express shoots up
studying her what did you do to your hair
it was making me nervous so i chopped it off
big mistake huh
i sort of like it
he sniffs takes out a kleenex wipes his nose
say you got a lulu
i better not get too close
oh i never catch colds
i was looking at some figures from the sickness and accident claims division do you know that the average new yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two
and a half colds a year
that makes me feel just terrible
well to make the figures come out even since i have no colds a year some poor slob must have five colds a year
dabs his nose you should have stayed in bed this morning
i should have stayed in bed last night
the elevator has slowed down now stops
fran opens the door
watch your step
about a third of the passengers get out including bud and mr
as kirkeby passes fran he slaps her behind with his folded newspaper
fran jumps slightly
all in the days work and watch your hand mr
innocently i beg your pardon
one of these days im going to shut those doors on you and she withdraws her hand into the sleeve of her uniform and waves the amputated arm at him
the doors close
kirkeby turns away from the elevator and grinning smugly falls in beside bud
that kubelik boy
would i like to get her on a slow elevator to china
shes the best operator in the building
im a pretty good operator myself but she just wont give me a tumble date wise
maybe youre using the wrong approach
a lot of guys around here have tried it all kinds of approaches no dice
what is she trying to prove
could be shes just a nice respectable girl there are millions of them
listen to him
little lord fauntleroy
leaving bud at the employees coat racks kirkeby heads toward his office one of the glass enclosed cubicles
bud hangs up his hat and raincoat stows away the gloves and muffler
out of his coat pocket he takes a plastic anti histamine sprayer and a box of cough drops and still carrying the kleenex threads his way to his desk
most of the desks are already occupied and the others are filling rapidly
once seated at his desk bud arranges his medicaments neatly in front of him
he takes a kleenex out of the box blows his nose then leaning back in his swivel chair sprays first one nostril then the other
suddenly the piercing bell goes off the workday has begun
being the ultra conscientious type bud instantly sits upright in his chair removes the cover from his computing machine picks up a batch of perforated premium cards starts entering figures
on his computer
after a few seconds he glances around to make sure that everybody in the vicinity is busy
then he looks up a number in the company telephone directory dials furtively
cupping hand over phone mouthpiece hello mr
this is baxter on the nineteenth floor
it is a glass enclosed cubicle on the twenty first floor
through the glass we see another enormous layout of desks everybody working away
dobisch is holding the phone in one hand running an electric shaver over his face with the other
oh buddy boy
i was just about to call you
shuts off electric shaver im sorry about that mess on the living room wall
you see my little friend she kept insisting picasso was a bum so she started to do that mural but im sure it will wash off just eyebrow pencil
its not picasso im calling about
its the key to my apartment you were supposed to leave it under the mat
i did didnt i
i distinctly remember bending over and putting it there oh i found a key there all right only its the wrong key
takes buds key out of his pocket well how about that
no wonder i couldnt get into the executive washroom this morning
and i couldnt get into my apartment so at four a
i had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut
thats a shame
ill send the key right down
and about your promotion leafs through report on desk im sending that efficiency report right up to mr
sheldrake in personnel
i wouldnt be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over
thank you mr
he hangs up feels his forehead
it is warm
clipped to his handkerchief pocket are a black fountain pen and next to it a thermometer in a black case
bud unclips the thermometer case unscrews the cap shakes the thermometer out puts it under his tongue
he resumes work
a messenger comes up to his desk with an interoffice envelope
thermometer in mouth wait
he turns away from the messenger unties the string of the envelope takes his key out puts it in a coat pocket
from a trouser pocket he extracts dobischs key to the executive washroom slips it discreetly into the envelope reties it hands it to the messenger
thermometer in mouth to mr
puzzled by the whole procedure the messenger leaves
bud now removes the thermometer from his mouth reads it
its worse than he thought
he puts the thermometer back in the case clips it to his pocket takes his desk calendar out of a drawer turns a leaf
under the date wednesday november there is an entry in his handwriting mr
bud consults the telephone directory again picks up the phone dials
this is another glass enclosed cubicle on another floor
vanderhof a junior chamber of commerce type is dictating to an elderly secretary who sits across the desk from him
macintosh phone rings and he picks it up vanderhof public relations

eichelberger a solid citizen of about fifty is displaying some mortgage graphs to three associates

kirkeby switches off the machine picks up the phone

he presses down the button on the cradle dials operator
there is a double switchboard in the center with nine girls on each side all busy as beavers

moffett has picked it up
as bud hangs up into phone all right ill tell him

shes been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes
they want you up stairs
he jumps up stuffs the nose spray into one pocket a handful of kleenex into the other
what gives baxter
you getting promoted or getting fired
cockily care to make a small wager
ive been here twice as long as you have shall we say a dollar
its a bet
bud snake hips between the desks like a broken field runner
at the elevator bud presses the up button paces nervously
one of the elevator doors opens and as bud starts inside the doors of the adjoining elevator open and fran kubelik sticks her head out
hearing her voice bud throws a quick excuse me to the other operator exits quickly and steps into frans elevator
twenty seven please
and drive carefully
youre carrying precious cargo i mean manpower wise
fran shuts the doors
fran presses a button and the elevator starts up
you may not realize it miss kubelik but im in the top ten efficiency wise and this may be the day promotion wise
youre beginning to sound like mr
now that theyre kicking me upstairs couldnt happen to a nicer guy
bud beams you know youre the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator
the characters you meet
something happens to men in elevators
must be the change of altitude the blood rushes to their head or something boy i could tell you stories id love to hear them
maybe we could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime or some evening after work the elevator has stopped and fran opens the doors
it is pretty plush up here soft carpeting and tall mahogany doors leading to the executive offices
the elevator door is open and bud steps out
i hope everything goes all right
i hope so
turning back wouldnt you know theyd call me on a day like this with my cold and everything fumbling with his tie how do i look
stepping out of elevator wait
she takes the carnation out of her lapel starts to put it in buds buttonhole
thats the first thing i ever noticed about you when you were still on the local elevator you always wore a flower the elevator buzzer is now sounding insistently
fran steps back inside
and wipe your nose
she shuts the doors
bud looks after her then takes a kleenex out of his pocket and wiping his nose crosses to a glass door marked j
sheldrake director of personnel
he stashes the used kleenex away in another pocket enters
it is a sedate office with a secretary and a couple of typists
the secretarys name is miss olsen
she is in her thirties flaxen haired handsome wears harlequin glasses and has an incisive manner
bud comes up to her desk
baxter ordinary premium accounting mr
sheldrake called me
i called you that is i tried to call you for twenty minutes
im sorry i go on in
she indicates the door leading to the inner office
bud squares his shoulders and starts in
sheldrake is a a year man and rates a four window office
it is not quite an executive suite but it is several pegs above the glass cubicles of the middle echelon
there is lots of leather and a large desk behind which sits mr
he is a substantial looking authoritative man in his middle forties a pillar of his suburban community a blood donor and a family man
the latter is attested to by a framed photograph showing two boys aged and in military school uniforms
as baxter comes through the door sheldrake is leafing through dobischs efficiency report
he looks up at bud through a pair of heavy rimmed reading glasses
studying him i was sort of wondering what you looked like
he seats himself on the very edge of the leather armchair facing sheldrake
been hearing some very nice things about you heres a report from mr
dobisch loyal cooperative resourceful mr
dobisch said that
kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office without overtime
modestly well you know how it is things pile up
vanderhof in public relations and mr
eichelberger in mortgage and loan theyd both like to have you transferred to their departments
thats very flattering
sheldrake puts the report down takes off his glasses leans across the desk toward bud
tell me baxter just what is it that makes you so popular
i dont know
bud does so
for a moment he is a picture of intense concentration
then would you mind repeating the question
look baxter im not stupid
i know everything that goes on in this building in every department on every floor every day of the year
in a very small voice you do
rises starts pacing in we had an employee here name of fowler
he was very popular too
turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the actuarial department tying up the switchboard figuring the odds on our i
machines so the day before the kentucky derby i called in the vice squad and we raided the thirteenth floor
worried the vice squad
thats right baxter
what whats that got to do with me
im not running any bookie joint
what kind of joint are you running
theres a certain key floating around the office from kirkeby to vanderhof to eichelberger to dobisch its the key to a certain apartment and you know who that apartment belongs
loyal cooperative resourceful c
are you going to deny it
im not going to deny it
but if youd just let me explain you better
a deep breath well about six months ago i was going to night school taking this course in advanced accounting and one of the guys in our department he lives
in jersey he was going to a banquet at the biltmore his wife was meeting him in town and he needed someplace to change into a tuxedo so i gave him the key and word must have gotten around because the next thing i knew all sorts of guys were suddenly going to banquets and when you give the key to one guy you cant say no to another and the whole thing got out of hand pardon me
he whips out the nasal spray administers a couple of quick squirts up each nostril
baxter an insurance company is founded on public trust
any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming shifting into a new gear how many charter members are there in this little club of yours
just those four out of a total of so actually we can be very proud of our personnel percentage wise
thats not the point
four rotten apples in a barrel no matter how large the barrel you realize that if this ever leaked out oh it wont
and its not going to happen again
from now on nobody is going to use my apartment in his vehemence he squeezes the spray bottle which squirts all over the desk
where is your apartment
west th street
you have no idea what ive been going through with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key how do you work it with the key
well usually i slip it to them in the office and they leave it under the mat but never again i can promise you that the phone buzzer sounds and
sheldrake picks up the phone
yes miss olsen
miss olsen is on the phone
sheldrake returning your call on two she presses a button down starts to hang the phone up glances around to see if the typists are watching then raises the receiver
to her ear and eavesdrops on the conversation
sheldrake is talking into the phone
yes dear i called you earlier where were you
oh you took tommy to the dentist during this bud has risen from his chair started inching toward the door
turning to him where are you going baxter
well i dont want to intrude and i thought since its all straightened out anyway im not through with you yet

baxter youre not reading me
i told you i have plans
so do i im going to take four aspirins and get into bed so you better give the tickets to somebody else im not just giving those tickets baxter i
want to swap them
sheldrake picks up the dobisch reports puts on his glasses turns a page
it also says here that you are alert astute and quite imaginative oh
the dawn is breaking oh
he reaches into his coat pocket fishes out a handful of kleenex and then finally the key to his apartment
he holds it up
thats good thinking baxter
next month theres going to be a shift in personnel around here and as far as im concerned youre executive material
now put down the key pushing a pad toward him and put down the address
bud lays the key on the desk unclips what he thinks is his fountain pen uncaps it starts writing on the pad
its on the second floor my name is not on the door it just says suddenly he realizes that he has been trying to write the address with the thermometer
oh terribly sorry
its that cold relax baxter
thank you sir
he has replaced the thermometer with the fountain pen and is scribbling the address
youll be careful with the record player wont you
and about the liquor i ordered some this morning but im not sure when theyll deliver it he has finished writing the address shoves the pad over to sheldrake
now remember baxter this is going to be our little secret
yes of course
you know how people talk
oh you dont have to worry not that i have anything to hide
oh no sir
anyway its none of my business four apples five apples whats the difference percentage wise
holding out the tickets here you are baxter
have a nice time
you too sir
clutching the tickets he backs out of the office
it is about and the building has pretty well emptied out by now
bud in raincoat and hat is leaning against one of the marble pillars beyond the elevators
his raincoat is unbuttoned and frans carnation is still in his lapel
he is looking off expectantly toward a door marked employees some of the female employees are emerging dressed for the street
among them are sylvia and her colleague from the switchboard
so i figure a man in his position hes going to take me to and el morocco instead he takes me to hamburg heaven and some schnooks apartment they pass
bud without paying any attention to him
bud has heard the crack and looks after sylvia a little hurt
then he glances back toward the door of the lounge as it opens and fran kubelik comes out
she is wearing a wool coat over a street dress no hat
passing bud good night
casually good night
she is about three paces beyond him when he suddenly realizes who it is
oh miss kubelik
he rushes after her taking off his hat ive been waiting for you
i almost didnt recognize you this is the first time ive ever seen you in civilian clothes
howd you make out on the twenty seventh floor
look have you seen the music man
would you like to
i thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first and then you mean tonight
im sorry but i cant tonight
im meeting somebody
a beat you mean like a girl friend
like a man
she proceeds across the lobby toward the street entrance bud following her
i wasnt trying to be personal its just that the fellows in the office were whether you wondering about you ever just tell em now and then
this date is it just a date or is it something serious
it used to be serious at least i was but he wasnt so the whole thing is more or less kaputt
well in that case couldnt you
im afraid not
i promised to have a drink with him hes been calling me all week oh i understand
he follows her out through the revolving doors
fran and bud come out
putting his hat on well it was just an idea i hate to see a ticket go to waste stops what time does the show go on
looks at her watch well i could meet you at the theatre if thats all right
its the majestic th street
meet you in the lobby
bud nods happily falls in beside her as she starts down the street
you know i felt so lousy this morning a hundred and one fever then my promotion came up now you and i eleventh row center and you said i should
have stayed in bed
how is your cold
high as a kite what cold
and after the show we could go out on the town does a little cha cha step ive been taking from arthur murray
so i see
they got a great little band at el chico in the village its practically around the corner from where you live
a sudden thought how do you know where i live
oh i even know who you live with your sister and brother in law i know when you were born and where i know all sorts of things about you
a couple of months ago i looked up your card in the group insurance file
i know your height your weight and your social security number you had mumps you had measles and you had your appendix out
they have now reached the corner and fran stops
well dont tell the fellows in the office about the appendix
they may get the wrong idea how you found out
turning the corner bye
calling after her eight thirty
he watches her walk away an idiot grin on his face
despite what he told fran his nose is stuffed up so he takes out the anti histamine and sprays his nostrils
then carried away he squirts some of the stuff on the carnation in his buttonhole moves off in the opposite direction
fran comes hurrying along the street
she is late
her objective is a small chinese restaurant with a neon sign reading the rickshaw cocktails cantonese food
she starts down a flight of steps leading to the entrance
the bar is a long narrow dimly lit room with booths along one side
beyond a bamboo curtain is the main dining room which does not concern us
the place is decorated in early beachcomber style rattan fish nets conch shells etc
the help is chinese
at this early hour there are only half a dozen customers in the place all at the bar except for one man sitting in the last booth with his back
at a piano a chinese member of local is improvising mood music
fran comes through the door and without looking around heads straight for the last booth
the bartender nods to her they know her there
as she passes the piano player he gives her a big smile segues into jealous lover
fran comes up to the man sitting in the last booth
a wistful smile good evening mr
sheldrake for thats who it is looks around nervously to make sure no one has heard her
please fran not so loud
he gets up still afraid somebody may see us together
reaching for her coat let me take that
i cant stay very long
sits opposite him with her coat on can i have a frozen daiquiri
its on the way
sits down i see you went ahead and cut your hair
you know i liked it better long
yes i know
you want a lock to carry in your wallet
a waiter comes up with a tray two daiquiris fried shrimp eggrolls and a bowl of sauce
showing all his teeth evening lady
nice see you again
the waiter has set everything on the table leaves
how long has it been a month
but whos counting
i missed you fran
like old times
same booth same song its been hell
dipping shrimp same sauce sweet and sour
you dont know what its like standing next to you in that elevator day after day good morning miss kubelik good night mr
sheldrake im still crazy about you fran
avoiding his eyes lets not start on that again jeff please
im just beginning to get over it
i dont believe you
look jeff we had two wonderful months this summer and that was it
happens all the time the wife and kids go away to the country and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist or the elevator girl
comes september the picnic is over goodbye
the kids go back to school the boss goes back to the wife and the girl she is barely able to control herself they dont make these shrimp like they
i never said goodbye fran
not listening for a while there you try kidding yourself that youre going with an unmarried man
then one day he keeps looking at his watch and asks you if theres any lipstick showing then rushes off to catch the seven fourteen to white plains
so you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee and you sit there by yourself and you think and it all begins to look so ugly there are tears in
she breaks off downs whats left of the daiquiri
how do you think i felt riding home on that seven fourteen train
why do you keep calling me jeff
what do you want from me
taking her hand i want you back fran
withdrawing her hand sorry mr
sheldrake im full up
youll have to take the next elevator
youre not giving me a chance fran
i asked you to meet me because i have something to tell you
go ahead tell me
a glance around not here fran
cant we go some place else
i have a date at eight thirty
not very but im going to be there anyway
she takes out an inexpensive square compact with a fleur de lis pattern on it opens it starts to fix her face
the waiter comes up with a couple of menus
you ready order dinner now
bring us two more drinks
it is and there is the usual hectic to do taxis pulling up people milling around the sidewalk and crowding into the lobby
in the middle of this melee buffeted by the throng stands bud in raincoat and hat looking anxiously for fran
fran and sheldrake in the booth are working on the second round of drinks
fran remember that last weekend we had
wryly do i
that leaky little boat you rented and me in a black negligee and a life preserver remember what we talked about
we talked about a lot of things
i mean about my getting a divorce
we didnt talk about it you did
you didnt really believe me did you
shrugging they got it an a long playing record now music to string her along by
my wife doesnt understand me we havent gotten along for years youre the best thing that ever happened to me thats enough fran
going right on just trust me baby well work it out somehow youre not being funny
i wasnt trying
if youll just listen to me for a minute okay
i saw my lawyer this morning i wanted his advice about the best way to handle it handle what
what do you think
looking at him for a long moment then lets get something straight jeff i never asked you to leave your wife
of course not
you had nothing to do with it
her eyes misting up again are you sure thats what you want
if youll just tell me that you still love me softly you know i do
fran he takes her hand kisses it
the bar has been filling up and now two couples are seating themselves in a nearby booth
one of the women is miss olsen
pulling her hand away gently jeff darling she indicates the other customers
sheldrake glances over his shoulder
it is crowding up
lets get out of here
sheldrake leaves some money on the table leads fran toward the entrance
as they pass miss olsens booth she turns around slowly and putting on her glasses looks after them
sheldrake slips a bill to the piano player who gives them a big smile slides into jealous lover again
retrieving his hat and coat from the checkroom girl sheldrake steers fran through the door
miss olsen watches them with a cold smile
fran and sheldrake come up the steps
to a passing cab taxi
it passes without stopping
i have that date remember
i love you remember
another taxi approaches
sheldrake gives a shrill whistle and it pulls up
he opens the door
where are we going jeff
not back to that leaky boat i promise
he helps her into the cab takes out of his coat pocket the page from the pad on which bud wrote the address of the apartment
to cab driver west sixty seventh
he gets in beside fran shuts the door
as the cab pulls away through the rear window the two can be seen kissing
its oclock the lobby is deserted and standing on the sidewalk all by himself is bud
he takes a kleenex out of his pocket blows his nose stuffs the used kleenex in another pocket
he looks up and down the street consults his watch decides to wait just a little longer
the leaves are flipping over
sheldrake seems to be using the apartment regularly for the name sheldrake in buds handwriting appears on the pages dated monday november thursday november thursday november monday november and monday
sheldrake also seems to be baxters only customer by now since the other leaves of the calendar are blank
it is a gloomy december morning and hundreds of desk bound employees are bent over their paper work
bud baxter in raincoat and hat is clearing out his desk
he has piled everything on his blotter pad reference books papers a fountain pen set pencils paper clips and the calendar
watching him from the next desk is a dumbfounded moffett
bud picks up the blotter pad with his stuff on it and as he moves past moffetts desk moffett takes out a dollar bill drops it grudgingly on the loaded
bud flashes him a little grin continues between the desks toward the row of glass enclosed offices housing the supervisory personnel
he comes up to an unoccupied cubicle
a sign painter is brushing in some new lettering on the glass door it reads c
baxter second administrative assistant
bud studies the sign with a good deal of satisfaction
to painter would you mind
the painter turns around c
baxter thats me
with an oh the painter opens the door for him
bud enters his new office deposits his stuff on the bare desk looks around possessively
the small cubicle boasts one window carpeting on the floor a filing cabinet a couple of synthetic leather chairs and a clothes tree to bud it is the taj mahal
he crosses to the clothes tree removes his hat and coat hangs them up
from off comes hi buddy boy
congratulations and all that jazz
kirkeby dobisch eichelberger and vanderhof have come into the office
well you made it kid just like we promised
quite an office name on the door rug on the floor the whole schmear
teamwork thats what counts in an organization like this
all for one and one for all know what i mean
i have a vague idea
kirkeby signals to vanderhof who shuts the door
the four charter members of the club start closing in on bud
baxter were a little disappointed in you gratitude wise
oh im very grateful
then why are you locking us out all of a sudden
its been sort of rough these last few weeks what with my cold and like that he has picked up the desk calendar shoves it discreetly into one of the
we went to bat for you and now you wont play ball with us
well after all its my apartment its private property its not a public playground
all right so you got yourself a girl thats okay with us but not every night of the week
how selfish can you get
to the others last week i had to borrow my nephews car and take sylvia to a drive in in jersey
im too old for that sort of thing i mean in a volkswagen
i sympathize with your problem and believe me im very sorry youll be a lot sorrier before were through with you
you threatening me
listen baxter we made you and we can break you
he deliberately flips a cigar ash on buds desk
at the same time the door opens and sheldrake comes striding in briskly
good morning mr
the others swivel around
to bud everything satisfactory
you like your office
oh yes sir
and i want to thank you dont thank me thank your friends here theyre the ones who recommended you
the four friends manage to work up some sickly smiles
we just dropped in to wish him the best
quickly brushes cigar ash off desk as they move toward the door so long baxter
we know you wont let us down
so long fellas
drop in any time
the door is always open to my office
sheldrake and bud are alone
i like the way you handled that
well how does it feel to be an executive
and i want you to know ill work very hard to justify your confidence in me sure you will
a beat say baxter about the apartment now that you got a raise dont you think we can afford a second key
well i guess so
you know my secretary miss olsen oh yes
is she the lucky one
no you dont understand
shes a busybody always poking her nose into things and with that key passing back and forth why take chances
you cant be too careful
he glances toward the glass partitions to make sure that nobody is watching
i have something here i think it belongs to you
out of his pocket he has slipped the compact with the fleur de lis pattern we saw fran use at the rickshaw
he holds it out to sheldrake
i mean the young lady whoever she may be it was on the couch when i got home last night
the mirror is broken
opens compact revealing crack in mirror it was broken when i found it
so it was
takes the compact she threw it at me
you know how it is sooner or later they all give you a bad time
man of the world i know how it is
you see a girl a couple of times a week just for laughs and right away she thinks youre going to divorce your wife
i ask you is that fair
thats very unfair especially to your wife
shifting gears you know baxter i envy you
bachelor all the dames you want no headaches no complications yes sir
thats the life all right
put me down for thursday again
and ill get that other key
bud takes the calendar out of the desk drawer makes an entry
again the leaves are flipping over and again we see sheldrakes name in buds handwriting booked for the following dates monday december thursday december monday december thursday december
perched on top of the switchboard is a small decorated christmas tree and the operators are dispensing holiday greetings to all callers
consolidated life merry christmas ill connect you consolidated life merry christmas im ringing in the foreground sylvia is engaged in a private conversation of her own
into mouthpiece yeah
you bet she tears off her headset and turns to the other girls
somebody watch my line theres a swinging party up on the nineteenth floor she scoots out the door
the other girls immediately abandon their posts and dash after her
its a swinging party all right
nobody is working
several desks have been cleared and pushed together and on top of this improvised stage four female employees and mr
dobisch with his pants legs rolled up are doing a rockette kick routine to the tune of jingle bells
employees are ringed around the performers some drinking out of paper cups others singing and clapping in rhythm
one of the cubicles has been transformed into a bar and it is jammed with people
kirkeby and mr
vanderhof are pouring each has a couple of bottles of liquor in his hands and is emptying them into the open top of a water cooler
but the stuff is flowing out as fast as it flows in everybody is in line with a paper cup waiting for a refill
bud comes shouldering his way out of the crowded cubicle holding aloft two paper cups filled with booze
since his promotion he has bought himself a new suit dark flannel and with it he wears a white shirt with a pinned round collar and a foulard tie
he also has quite a glow on
detouring past necking couples he heads in the direction of the elevators
the doors of frans elevator are just opening and the switchboard operators led by sylvia come streaming out
to a colleague so i said to him never again
either get yourself a bigger car or a smaller girl as they head for the party they pass bud who is approaching the elevator with the two drinks
fran is just closing the elevator doors
the doors slide open again and fran looks out
instead of the customary carnation in the lapel of her uniform she wears a sprig of holly
holding out one of the drinks marry christmas
takes drink i thought you were avoiding me
what gave you that idea
in the last six weeks youve only been in my elevator once and then you didnt take your hat off
well as a matter of fact i was rather hurt when you stood me up that night i dont blame you
it was unforgivable
i forgive you
you couldnt help yourself
i mean when youre having a drink with one man you cant just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man
you did the only decent thing
dont be too sure
just because i wear a uniform that doesnt make me a girl scout
miss kubelik one doesnt get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless hes a pretty good judge of character and as far as im concerned youre tops
i mean decency wise and otherwise wise
they down their drinks
bud takes the empty cup from her
indicating elevator i shouldnt drink when im driving
youre so right
he reaches into the elevator takes a cardboard sign off a hook hangs it on the elevator door
it reads use other by the power vested in me i herewith declare this elevator out of order
leading her toward the party shall we join the natives
as they pass a kissing couple they seem friendly enough
dont you believe it
later on there will be human sacrifices white collar workers tossed into the computing machines and punched full of those little square holes
how many of those drinks did you have
holding up four fingers three
i thought so
they have now reached the entrance to the bar which is overflowing with thirsty natives
you wait here
i think i hear the sound of running water
he leaves her outside the cubicle and elbows his way through the crowd toward the booze filled water cooler
out of another cubicle comes miss olsen cup in hand
she too has had quite a few
seeing fran she walks up to her with an acid smile on her face
hows the branch manager from kansas city
i beg your pardon
im miss olsen mr
yes i know
so you dont have to play innocent with me
he used to tell his wife that i was the branch manager from seattle four years ago when we were having a little ring a ding ding
i dont know what youre talking about
and before me there was miss rossi in auditing and after me there was miss koch in disability and just before you there was miss whats her name on the
twenty fifth floor wanting to get away will you excuse me
holding her by the arm what for
you havent done anything its him what a salesman always the last booth in the chinese restaurant and the same pitch about divorcing his wife and in the end you
wind up with egg foo yong on your face
bud comes burrowing out of the crowded cubicle balancing the two filled paper cups spots fran
fran turns away from miss olsen
well thank you
always happy to do something for our girls in uniform
she moves off as bud joins fran who is looking a little pale
you all right
whats the matter
takes the drink there are just too many people here
why dont we step into any office
theres something i want your advice about anyway
leads her toward his cubicle i have my own office now naturally
and you may be interested to know im the second youngest executive in the company the only one younger is a grandson of the chairman of the board
bud ushers fran in and is confronted by a strange couple necking in the corner
he gestures them out crosses to his desk
miss kubelik i would like your honest opinion
ive had this in my desk for a week cost me fifteen dollars but i just couldnt get up enough nerve to wear it from under the desk he has
produced a hatbox and out of the hatbox a black bowler which he now puts on his head
its what they call the junior executive model
what do you think
fran looks at him blankly absorbed in her own thoughts
guess i made a boo boo huh
paying attention again no i like it
you mean you wouldnt be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this
of course not
maybe if i wore it a little more to the side adjusting hat is that better
well as long as you wouldnt be ashamed to be seen with me how about the three of us going out this evening you and me and the bowler stroll
down fifth avenue sort of break it in this is a bad day for me
christmas family and all that id better get back to my elevator
i dont want to be fired
oh you dont have to worry about that
i have quite a bit of influence in personnel
you know mr
he and i are like this
crosses his fingers sent me a christmas card
he has picked up a christmas card from his desk shows it to fran
it is a photograph of the sheldrake clan grouped around an elaborate christmas tree mr
sheldrake the two boys in military school uniforms and a big french poodle
underneath it says from the sheldrakes emily jeff tommy jeff jr
studying the card ruefully makes a cute picture
i thought maybe i could put in a word for you with mr
sheldrake get you a little promotion how would you like to be an elevator starter
im afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me
why dont we discuss it sometime over the holidays i could call you and pick you up and well have the big unveiling touching the brim of his bowler you
sure this is the right way to wear it
i think so
you dont think its tilted a little too much fran takes her compact out of her uniform pocket opens it hands it to bud
examining himself in the mirror after all this is a conservative firm i dont want people to think im an entertainer his voice trails off
there is something familiar about the cracked mirror of the compact and the fleur de lis pattern on the case confirms his suspicion
fran notices the peculiar expression on his face
what is it
with difficulty the mirror its broken
i like it this way makes me look the way i feel
the phone has started to ring
bud doesnt hear it
he closes the compact hands it to fran
picks up phone from desk yes
throws a quick look at fran just a minute
covers mouthpiece to fran if you dont mind this is sort of personal all right
have a nice christmas
she exits closing the door
bud takes his hand off the mouthpiece
every word hurts yes mr
sheldrake no i didnt forget the tree is up and the tom and jerry mix is in the refrigerator yes sir same to you
he hangs up stands there for a moment the bowler still on his head the noise from the party washing over him
he slowly crosses to the clothes tree
picks up his coat a new black chesterfield
with the coat over his arm he starts out of the office
the party has picked up tempo
on top of the desks sylvia is doing a mock strip tease without taking any clothes off
there is hollering drinking and clapping all around her
bud moves past the floor show paying no attention
kirkeby spots him detaches himself from the cheering section around sylvia
where you going buddy boy
the partys just starting
catching up with him listen kid give me a break will you how about tomorrow afternoon
i cant take her to that drive in again the car doesnt even have a heater four oclock okay
bud ignores him continues walking through the ranks of empty desks
it is six oclock and the joint is crowded with customers having one for the road before joining their families for christmas eve
there are men with gaily wrapped packages small trussed up christmas trees a plucked turkey in a plastic bag
written across the mirror behind the bar in glittering white letters is happy holidays
everybody is in high spirits laughing it up and toasting each other
everybody except bud baxter
he is standing at the bar in his chesterfield and bowler slightly isolated brooding over an almost empty martini glass
the bartender comes up sets down a fresh martini with an olive on a toothpick takes his payment from a pile of bills and coins lying in front of bud
bud fishes out the olive adds it to half a dozen other impaled olives neatly arranged in fan shape on the counter
he is obviously trying to complete the circle
a short rotund man dressed as santa claus hurries in from the street and comes up to the bar beside bud
to bartender hey charlie give me a shot of bourbon and step on it my sleigh is double parked
he laughs uproariously at his own joke nudges bud with his elbow
bud stares at him coldly turns back to his martini
the laughter dies in santa claus throat
he gets his short of bourbon moves down the bar to find more convivial company
standing near the end of the curved bar is a girl in her middle twenties wearing a ratty fur coat
her name is margie macdougall she is drinking a rum collins through a straw and she too is alone
from a distance she is studying bud with interest
on the bar in front of her is a container of straws in paper wrappers
she takes one of them out tears off the end of the paper blows through the straw sending the wrapper floating toward bud
the paper wrapper passes right in front of buds nose
he doesnt notice it
margie undaunted lets go with another missile
this time the wrapper lands on the brim of buds bowler
another wrapper comes floating in hits buds cheek
he never takes his eye off his martini
margie leaves her place and carrying her handbag and her empty glass comes up alongside bud
without a word she reaches up and removes the wrapper from buds bowler
you buy me a drink ill buy you some music
sets the glass down rum collins
not waiting for an answer she heads for the juke box
bud looks after her noncommittally then turns to the bartender
indicating martini glass and another one of these little mothers
at the juke box margie has dropped a coin in and made her selection
the music starts adeste fidelis
she rejoins bud at the bar just as the bartender is putting down their drinks in front of them
bud removes the new olive adds it to the pattern on the counter in front of him
they both drink staring straight ahead
for quite a while there is complete silence between them
out of nowhere you like castro
a blank look from bud i mean how do you feel about castro
what is castro
you know that big shot down in cuba with the crazy beard
what about him
because as far as im concerned hes a no good fink
two weeks ago i wrote him a letter never even answered me
all i wanted him to do was let mickey out for christmas
who is mickey
hes in havana in jail
mixed up in that revolution
he wouldnt do nothing like that
hes a jockey
they caught him doping a horse
well you cant win em all
they sit there silently for a moment contemplating the injustices of the world
to herself twas the night before christmas and all through the house not a creature was stirring nothing no action dullsville
drinks to bud you married
a night like this it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment
i said i had no family i didnt say i had an empty apartment
they both drink
the living room is dark except for a shaft of light from the kitchen and the glow of the colored bulbs on a small christmas tree in front of the
hunched up in one corner of the couch is fran still in her coat and gloves crying softly
pacing up and down is sheldrake
his coat and hat are on a chair as are several christmas packages
on the coffee table are an unopened bottle of scotch a couple of untouched glasses and a bowl of melting ice
stops and faces fran come on fran dont be like that
you just going to sit there and keep bawling
no answer you wont talk to me you wont tell me whats wrong a new approach look i know you think im stalling you
but when youve been married to a woman for twelve years you dont just sit down at the breakfast table and say pass the sugar and i want a divorce
its not that easy
he resumes pacing fran continues crying anyway this is the wrong time
the kids are home from school my in laws are visiting for the holidays i cant bring it up now
stops in front of her this isnt like you fran you were always such a good sport such fun to be with through tears yeah thats me
the happy idiot a million laughs

i laughed so much i like to died
is that whats been bothering you miss olsen
thats ancient history
i was never very good at history
let me see there was miss olsen and then there was miss rossi no she came before it was miss koch who came after miss olsen now fran and just
think right now theres some lucky girl in the building whos going to come after me okay okay fran
i deserve that
but just ask yourself why does a man run around with a lot of girls
because hes unhappy at home because hes lonely thats why all that was before you fran ive stopped running
fran has taken a handkerchief out of her bag and is dabbing her eyes
how could i be so stupid
youd think i would have learned by now when youre in love with a married man you shouldnt wear mascara
its christmas eve fran lets not fight
she hands him a flat wrapped package
what is it
he strips away the wrapping to reveal a long playing record
the cover reads rickshaw boy jimmy lee kiang with orchestra
our friend from the chinese restaurant
we better keep it here
yeah we better
i have a present for you
i didnt quite know what to get you anyway its a little awkward for me shopping he has taken out a money clip detaches a bill so heres a hundred
dollars go out and buy yourself something
he holds the money out but she doesnt move
sheldrake slips the bill into her open bag
they have some nice alligator bags at bergdorfs fran gets up slowly and starts peeling off her gloves
sheldrake looks at her then glances nervously at his wrist watch
fran its a quarter to seven and i mustnt miss the train if we hadnt wasted all that time i have to get home and trim the tree fran has
started to remove her coat
shrugs the coat back on i just thought as long as it was paid for an angry step toward her dont ever talk like that fran
dont make yourself out to be cheap
a hundred dollars
i wouldnt call that cheap
and you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment grabbing her arms stop that fran
quietly youll miss your train jeff
sheldrake hurriedly puts on his hat and coat gathers up his packages
you run along i want to fix my face
heading for the door dont forget to kill the lights
see you monday
monday and thursday and monday again and thursday again that stops him in the half open door it wont always be like this
coming back i love you fran
holding the packages to one side he tries to kiss her on the mouth
turning her head careful lipstick
he kisses her on the cheek hurries out of the apartment closing the door
fran stands there for a while blinking back tears then takes the long playing record out of its envelope crosses to the phonograph
she puts the record on starts the machine the music is jealous lover
as it plays fran wanders aimlessly around the darkened room her body wracked by sobs
finally she regains control of herself and picking up her handbag starts through the bedroom toward the bathroom
in the bathroom fran switches on the light puts her bag on the sink turns on the faucet
scooping up some water she washes the smeared mascara away then turns the faucet off picks up a towel as she is drying her face she notices in the pull
away shaving mirror the magnified reflection of a vial of pills on the medicine shelf
fran reaches out for the vial turns it slowly around in her hand
the label reads seconal one at bedtime as needed for sleep
fran studies the label for a second then returns the vial to the shelf
she opens her handbag takes out a lipstick
as she does so she sees the hundred dollar bill sheldrake left in the bag
her eyes wander back to the vial on the medicine shelf
then very deliberately she picks up buds mouthwash glass removes the two toothbrushes from it turns on the faucet starts filling the glass with water
the joint is deserted now except for the santa claus who is leaning against the bar quite loaded and bud and margie macdougall who are dancing to a slow blues
coming from the juke box
bud is still in his overcoat and bowler and margie is wearing her fur coat
the bartender is sweeping up the place
to santa claus drink up pop
its closing time
but its early charlie
dont you know what night this is
i know charlie
i work for the outfit
he polishes off his drink walks out unsteadily
the bartender approaches the dancers
hey knock it off will you
bud and margie ignore him continue dancing or rather swaying limply cheek to cheek
the bartender crosses to the juke box pulls the plug out
the music stops but not bud and margie they continue dancing
o u t out
he goes to the front of the bar starts to extinguish the lights
margie picks up her handbag from the bar and bud downs the remains of his drink
where do we go my place or yours
peering at his watch might as well go to mine everybody else does
he leads her through the dark bar toward the entrance
the bartender holds the door open for them as they go out
bud and margie come walking down the street
as they reach the house bud starts up the steps but margie continues along the sidewalk
poor mickey when i think of him all by himself in that jail in havana opening her handbag want to see his picture
from steps not particularly
margie realizing her mistake hurries back to join him
hes so cute five foot two ninety nine pounds
like a little chihuahua
they pass through the front door into the vestibule
bud and margie are mounting the stairs toward the apartment
can i ask you a personal question
you got a girl friend
she may be a girl but shes no friend of mine
still stuck on her huh
stuck on her
obviously you dont know me very well
i dont know you at all
permit me c
baxter junior executive arthur murray graduate lover
macdougall margie to you
bud has taken the key out of his pocket opened the door to his apartment
this way mrs
he ushers her in
it is exactly the way we left it
there is no sign of fran except for the gloves she dropped on the coffee table earlier
bud switches on the light shuts the door
looking around say this is snugsville
helping her out of her coat mrs
macdougall i think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot
a gleam no kidding
ask anybody around here
as a matter of fact when its time for me to go and i may go just like that snaps his fingers i have promised my body to the columbia
shuddering deliciously gee
sort of gives you goose bumps just to think about it
well they havent got me yet baby
dig up some ice from the kitchen and lets not waste any time preliminary wise
im with you lover
she takes the bowl of melted ice bud has handed her disappears into the kitchen
as bud starts to remove his coat he becomes aware of a scratching noise from the phonograph
he crosses to it sees that the needle is stuck in the last groove of a long playing record
bud lifts the record off examines it curiously then puts it aside and substitutes the cha cha record
as the music starts he dances over to the coat rack beside the door hangs up his chesterfield and bowler
he turns back into the room still dancing suddenly spots frans gloves on the coffee table
he picks up the gloves looks around for some convenient place to get rid of them
moving over to the bedroom door he opens it tosses the gloves toward the bed inside
he shuts the door starts to turn away freezes in a delayed reaction to something he saw inside
he quickly opens the door again looks
sprawled across the bed on top of the bedspread is fran
the light from the bathroom falls across her
she is fully dressed still in her coat and apparently asleep
bud steps into the bedroom closing the door behind him walks over to fran
all right miss kubelik get up
its past checking out time and the hotel management would appreciate it if you would get the hell out of here
fran doesnt stir look miss kubelik i used to like you i used to like you a lot but its all over between us so beat it o u t
no reaction he puts a hand on her shoulder shakes her come on wake up
she doesnt respond
but something falls out of her hand rolls across the bed
bud picks it up looks at it it is his sleeping pill vial now uncapped and empty
a hoarse whisper oh my god
for a second he is paralyzed
then he drops the vial grabs fran lifts her into a sitting position on the bed shakes her violently
frans head droops to one side like a rag dolls
bud lets go of her rushes out
in the living room the phonograph is still cha cha ing away
bud dashes to the phone picks it up
then it occurs to him that he doesnt know whom to call and he hangs up
out of the kitchen comes margie with a bowlful of ice cubes
i broke a nail trying to get the ice tray out
you ought to buy yourself a new refrigerator
bud not listening runs past her to the hall door and out
calling after him i didnt mean right now
bud arrives at the door of the dreyfuss apartment starts ringing the doorbell and pounding with his fist
the door opens and dr
dreyfuss stands there sleepily pulling on his beaten bathrobe
words tumbling over each other theres a girl in my place she took some sleeping pills you better come quick i cant wake her up
let me get my bag
he disappears from the doorway
hurry up doc
bud turns and runs back into his apartment
margie has settled herself comfortably on the couch and is fixing the drinks
the cha cha music is still going
bud comes flying in heads for the bedroom
hey over here lover
bud stops in his tracks suddenly aware of her
whats all this running around
youre going to wear yourself out
bud strides over to her purposefully yanks her up to her feet
not so rough honey
taking the glass out of her hand good night
thrusting the fur coat at her the partys over
whats the matter
did i do something wrong
easing her toward door its an emergency see you some other time
dreyfuss comes hurrying in carrying his medical bag
he stops bewildered by the sound of music and the sight of a wide awake girl in the apartment
not this one pointing to the bedroom in there doc
dreyfuss proceeds into the bedroom
say whats going on here anyway
propelling her toward the door just clear out will you
pointing back my shoes
bud reaches under the coffee table where she left her shoes retrieves them
bitterly some lover you are
bud shoves the shoes at her takes a bill out of his wallet hands it to her
here find yourself a phone booth and call your husband in havana
you bet i will
and when i tell him how you treated me hell push your face in
he shoves her through the open door you fink
bud slams the door shut starts toward the bedroom
halfway there he becomes aware that the cha cha record is still on
he detours to the phonograph switches it off continues into the bedroom
in the bedroom the overhead light is on and dr
dreyfuss is working on the unconscious fran
he has removed her coat and is shining a flashlight into her eyes examining her pupils
bud approaches the bed worriedly
she going to be all right doc
how many pills were in that bottle
it was half full about a dozen or so
you going to have to take her to the hospital
dreyfuss ignores him
out of his medical bag he takes a stomach tube with a rubber funnel at the end
then he starts to lift fran off the bed
help me will you
between them they get fran into an upright position
into the bathroom
they half carry half drag frans limp form toward the bathroom
what are you going to do doc
get that stuff out of her stomach if it isnt too late
you better put some coffee on and pray
bud starts away as dr
dreyfuss takes fran into the bathroom
bud loses no time getting into the kitchen
he fills an aluminum kettle with water strikes a match lights the gas burner puts the kettle on
then he takes a jar of instant coffee and a chipped coffee mug out of the cupboard shakes an excessive portion of coffee into the mug sticks a spoon in
he watches the kettle for a moment mops his brow with a handkerchief then starts back toward the bedroom
bud crosses the bedroom to the half open door of the bathroom looks in anxiously
from inside come the sounds of a coughing spasm and running water
bud turns away undoes his tie and collar paces the bedroom floor
something on the night table attracts his attention resting against the base of the lamp is a sealed envelope
bud picks it up on it in frans handwriting is one word jeff
he turns the letter over in his hand trying to decide what to do with it
dreyfuss emerges from the bathroom carrying a pale still unconscious fran
bud quickly conceals the suicide note behind his back
bring my bag
he lugs fran into the living room
bud stashes the letter in his back pocket picks up the medical bag follows them
in the living room dr
dreyfuss lowers fran into a chair
her chin falls to her chest
dreyfuss takes the bag from bud fishes out a hypodermic syringe draws c
s from a bottle of picrotoxin
roll up her right sleeve
bud does so
dreyfuss hands the hypodermic to bud searches for a spot for the injection
he swabs the spot with alcohol takes the hypodermic back from bud
want to tell me what happened
i dont know i mean i wasnt here you see we had some words earlier nothing serious really what you might call a lovers quarrel making off scene injection so
you went right out and picked yourself up another dame
something like that
you know baxter youre a real cutie pie yes you are
bud just stands there taking it
fran stirs slightly and from her parched lips comes a low moan
dreyfuss grabs her by the hair lifts her head up
if youd come home half an hour later you would have had quite a christmas present
with his free hand dr
dreyfuss slaps fran viciously across the face
dreyfuss still holding fran by the hair takes a box of ammonia ampules out of his bag
he crushes one of the ampules in his hand passes it under her nose
fran tries to turn her head away
dreyfuss slaps her again hard crushes another ampule repeats the process
bud is watching tensely
from the kitchen comes the whistle of the boiling kettle but bud pays no attention
get the coffee
bud hurries into the kitchen
he turns off the gas pours the boiling water into the mug with the instant coffee stirs it
from off come the sounds of more slapping and some moaning
bud carries the coffee out
in the living room dr
dreyfuss is working another ammonia ampule under frans nose
her eyes start fluttering
dreyfuss takes the coffee mug from bud forces it between frans lips pours coffee into her mouth
fran resists instinctively half the coffee dribbling over her chin and dress but dr
dreyfuss keeps at it
lets get some air in here
open the windows
bud complies promptly pulls up the shades opens the windows wide
putting the empty mug down whats her name
miss kubelik fran
to fran slowly fran im a doctor

fran mutters something fran im dr
dreyfuss im here to help you

bud is coming back with the coffee
pointing to bud do you know who this is
fran tries to focus look at him
baxter nineteenth floor
hello miss kubelik
to bud mister miss such politeness
dreyfuss discreetly well we work in the same building and we try to keep it quiet to bud puzzled what are you doing here
bud throws dr
dreyfuss a look as if to say that frans mind still wasnt functioning properly
to fran dont you remember
we were at the office party together oh yes office party miss olsen thats right
dreyfuss improvising rapidly i told you we had a fight thats what it was about miss olsen you know that other girl you saw still trying to figure out buds
presence i dont understand its not important fran the main thing is that i got here in time and youre going to be all right to dr
dreyfuss isnt she doc
closing her eyes im so tired here drink this
he forces her to swallow some coffee
pushing the mug away please just let me sleep
you cant sleep
shaking her come on fran open your eyes
to bud lets get her walking
weve got to keep her awake for the next couple of hours
they lift her from the chair and each draping one of her arms over his shoulder they start to walk her up and down the room
urging fran on now walk fran
one two three four one two three four thats the idea left right left right now we turn one two three four at first frans feet just drag along the
floor between them
but gradually as dr
dreyfuss voice continues droning hypnotically she falls into the rhythm of it repeating the words after him and putting her weight on her feet
left right left right walk walk walk one two three four turn left right left right now you got it through the bedroom window comes the first faint light of
fran has been put to bed by an exhausted dr
she is in her slip and dreyfuss is just drawing the blanket over her
her eyes are closed and she is moaning fitfully
watching from the doorway is bud in shirtsleeves now weary and disheveled
shell sleep on and off for the next twenty four hours
of course shell have a dandy hangover when she wakes up just as long as shes okay
massaging his calves these cases are harder on the doctor than on the patient
i ought to charge you by the mile
they have now moved out into the living room where the overhead light and the christmas tree bulbs are still on
any of that coffee left
he goes into the kitchen
dreyfuss takes a small notebook with a fountain pen clipped to it out of his bag sinks down on the couch
how do you spell her last name
from kitchen kubelik with two ks
whats her address
no answer from bud where does she live
bud appears from the kitchen stirring the coffee powder in a cup of hot water
apprehensive why do you want to know doc
you dont have to report this do you
setting the coffee down she didnt mean it doc it was an accident she had a little too much to drink and she didnt know what she was doing there
was no suicide note or anything believe me doc im not thinking about myself sipping the hot coffee arent you
its just that shes got a family and theres the people in the office look doc cant you forget youre a doctor lets just say youre here as a neighbor
a long look at bud well as a doctor i guess i cant prove it wasnt an accident
closes notebook but as your neighbor id like to kick your keester clear around the block
indicating coffee mind if i cool this off
he uncaps the bottle of scotch pours a large slug into his coffee
taking a big gulp of the spiked coffee i dont know what you did to that girl in there and dont tell me but it was bound to happen the
way you carry on
live now pay later
another swig why dont you grow up baxter
be a mensch
you know what that means
im not sure
a mansch a human being
so you got off easy this time so you were lucky yeah wasnt i
finishing coffee but youre not out of the woods yet baxter because most of them try it again
picks up bag starts toward door you know where i am if you need me
he walks out closing the door after him
bud dejectedly turns off the overhead light kicks out the plug of the christmas tree lights trudges into the bedroom
fran is fast asleep
bud picks up her dress gets a hanger drapes the dress over it hangs it from the door
an early morning chill has invaded the room and bud switches an the electric blanket to keep fran warm
then he slumps into a chair beside the bed looks at fran compassionately
the light on the dial of the electric blanket glows in the grayish room
bud just sits there watching fran
lieberman followed by her dog is climbing the stairs to buds apartment puffing asthmatically
she seems quite angry as she arrives at the door and rings the bell
there is no answer
she starts knocking impatiently
open up already
finally the door opens a crack and bud peers out
he looks like a man who has slept in his clothes rumpled bleary eyed unshaven
so who did you think it was kris kringle
what was going on here last night
all that marching tramp tramp tramp you were having army maneuvers maybe
im sorry mrs
lieberman and ill never invite those people again
what you get from renting to bachelors
all night i didnt sleep ten minutes and im sure you woke up dr
dont worry about dr
dreyfuss i happen to know he was out on a case
im warning you mr
baxter this is a respectable house not a honky tonky
to the dog come on oscar
bud watches her start down the stairs with the dog withdraws into the apartment
bud closes the door crosses toward the bedroom looks inside
fran is asleep under the electric blanket breathing evenly
he tries to shut the bedroom door but it wont close completely because frans dress on a hanger
is hooked over the top
he goes to the phone picks it up dials the operator
his voice low operator i want white plains new york mr
sheldrake an added thought make it person to person
the decor is split level early american
there is a huge christmas tree and a jumble of presents open gift boxes and discarded wrappings
sheldrake and his two sons tommy and jeff jr
are squatting on the floor testing a cape canaveral set the kids got for christmas
sheldrake is in a brand new dressing gown with a manufacturers tag still dangling from it and the boys are in pajamas and astronauts helmets
as for the cape canaveral set it is a miniature layout of block houses launching pads and assorted space missiles
tommy has his finger on the button controlling one of the rockets
counting down let her rip
tommy presses the button and a spring sends the rocket toward the ceiling
just then the phone in the entrance hall starts ringing
ill get it
he hurries to the phone
hey dad why dont we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive
its a thought
maybe we should send up two flies and see if theyll propagate in orbit
see if theyll what
propagate you know multiply baby flies
coming back from the phone its for you dad
getting up baxter
person to person
sheldrake heads quickly for the phone
to jeff jr
come on help me round up some flies
in the entrance hall sheldrake picks up the phone turns his back toward the living room speaks in a low voice
yes whats on your mind baxter
i hate to disturb you but something came up its rather important and i think it would be a good idea if you could see me at the apartment as
soon as possible
youre not making sense baxter
whats this all about
i didnt want to tell you over the phone but that certain party you know who i mean i found her here last night she had taken an overdose of
from the stairway beyond him comes what is it jeff

sheldrake turns from the phone
halfway down the stairs is mrs
sheldrake in a quilted house robe
a nice recovery one of our employees had an accident i dont know why they bother me with these things on christmas day
into phone yes baxter just how serious is it
out of the corner of his eye he watches mrs
sheldrake come down the stairs pass behind him on the way to the living room
well it was touch and go there for a while but shes sleeping it off now
he glances through the half open door toward the sleeping fran
i thought maybe youd like to be here when she wakes up
an apprehensive look toward the living room youll have to handle this situation yourself as a matter of fact im counting on you into phone yes sir i understand
taking frans letter out of his pocket she left a note you want me to open it and read it to you
a beat well it was just a suggestion no you dont have to worry about that mr
sheldrake i kept your name out of it so therell be no trouble police wise or newspaper wise as bud continues talking on the phone fran in the bedroom opens
her eyes looks around vaguely trying to figure out where she is
she sits up in bed winces holds her head in her hands she has a fierce hangover
into phone you see the doctor hes a friend of mine we were very lucky in that respect actually he thinks shes my girl no he just jumped to the
conclusion around here im known as quite a ladies man in the bedroom fran becoming aware of buds voice crawls out of bed and holding on to the furniture moves unsteadily toward the living room door
into phone of course were not out of the woods yet sometimes they try it again yes sir ill do my best it looks like itll be a couple of
days before shes fully recovered and i may have a little problem with the landlady behind him fran appears in the bedroom doorway barefooted and in her slip
she leans groggily against the door post trying to focus on bud and to concentrate on what hes saying
into phone all right mr
sheldrake ill keep her in my apartment as long as i can any sort of message you want me to give her
well ill think of something goodbye mr
he hangs up the phone slowly
weakly im sorry
bud turns around sees her standing there on rubbery legs
im sorry mr
miss kubelik hurries toward her you shouldnt be out of bed
i didnt know i had no idea this was your apartment putting his arm around her let me help you
he leads her back into the bedroom
im so ashamed
why didnt you just let me die
what kind of talk is that
he lowers her onto the bed so you got a little over emotional but youre fine now
a groan my head it feels like a big wad of chewing gum
what time is it
struggling to her feet wheres my dress
i have to go home
her knees buckle
bud catches her
youre in no condition to go anywhere except back to bed
you dont want me here sure i do
its always nice to have company for christmas
he tries to put her back to bed
miss kubelik im stronger than you are i just want to go brush my teeth oh of course
i think theres a new toothbrush somewhere
he crosses to the bathroom takes a plaid robe off the hook on the back of the door hands it to fran
here put this on
in the bathroom he finds an unused toothbrush in a plastic container
his eyes fall on his safety razor
with a glance toward the bedroom he unscrews the razor removes the blade drops it in his shirt pocket
then he empties the blades from the dispenser puts those in his pocket
now he notices a bottle of iodine on the medicine shelf stashes that in another pocket just as fran appears in the doorway wearing the robe
handing her the toothbrush here
how about some breakfast
no i dont want anything
ill fix you some coffee
he crosses the bedroom heading for the kitchen stops
oh were all out of coffee you had quite a lot of it last night he thinks for a moment hurries toward the hall door
bud comes out of his apartment leaving the door half open heads for the dreyfuss apartment
he rings the bell peers down over the banister to make sure mrs
lieberman isnt snooping around
dreyfuss opens the door
dreyfuss can i borrow some coffee and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs
contemptuously eggs he asks me for
what you need is a good horse whipping
from me the doctor has no secrets
poor girl how could you do a thing like that
i didnt really do anything honest i mean you take a girl out a couple of times a week just for laughs and right away she thinks youre serious marriage
for you i wouldnt lift a finger but for her ill fix a little something to eat
she slams the door in his face bud starts back to his apartment
fran enters shakily from the bedroom looks around for the phone locates it picks it up
as she starts dialing bud comes in from the hall
who are you calling miss kubelik
my sister shell want to know what happened to me
alarmed wait a minute lets talk this over first
hurries up to her takes the receiver away just what are you going to tell her
well i havent figured it out exactly

ill tell her i spent the night with a friend
someone from the office

she is impressed with her own cleverness when are you coming home
as soon as i can walk
something wrong with your legs
no its my stomach
they had to pump it out
hanging up the phone miss kubelik i dont think you ought to call anybody not till that chewing gum is out of your head
leads her into bedroom but theyll be worried about me my brother in law may be calling the police thats why we have to be careful we dont want to
involve anybody after all mr
sheldrake is a married man thanks for reminding me
she pulls away from him starts to get into bed
contritely i didnt mean it that way i was just talking to him on the phone hes very concerned about you
he doesnt give a damn about me
oh youre wrong
he told me hes a liar
but thats not the worst part of it the worst part is i still love him
the doorbell rings
must be mrs
dreyfuss starts into living room remember the doctor from last night thats his wife
he opens the hall door
dreyfuss brushes past him with a tray full of food
so where is the victim
bud indicates the bedroom max the knife
she sweeps into the bedroom bud tagging along
to fran nu little lady how are we feeling today
i dont know kind of dizzy
the best thing for dizzy is a little noodle soup with chicken white meat and a glass tea
she sets the tray down on frans lap
im really not hungry
she hands her the soup spoon turns to bud
you wouldnt have such a thing as a napkin would you
well i have some paper towels beatnik
go to my kitchen third drawer under the good silver there is napkins
he starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two
fran is just sitting there the spoon in her hand not touching the soup
so what are you waiting for a singing commercial
i cant eat
dreyfuss takes the spoon from her starts to feed her
you must eat and you must get healthy and you must forget him
such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here clean and cut a regular ivy leaguer
turns out he is king farouk
mit the drinking mit the cha cha mit the no napkins
a girl like you for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup
who needs it
you listen to me you find yourself a nice substantial man a widower maybe and settle down instead of nashing all those sleeping pills for what for whom
for some good time charlie
sees bud approaching with napkin sssh
gaily one napkin coming up
hands it to fran i wish we had some champagne to wrap it around
to fran what did i tell you
uncomfortable look mrs
dreyfuss you dont have to wait around
ill wash the dishes and you wash em you break em
ill come back for them later
to fran if he makes trouble give me a yell
she doesnt seem to like you very much
oh i dont mind
as a matter of fact im sort of flattered that anybody should think a girl like you would do a thing like this over a guy like me
glancing at night table oh
did you find something here an envelope
yes ive got it
takes envelope out of back pocket dont you think wed better destroy it
so it wont fall into the wrong hands
bud tears open the envelope takes out sheldrakes hundred dollars
theres nothing here but a hundred dollar bill
will you see that mr
sheldrake gets it
he puts the money in his pocket
holding out tray here take this will you
bud relieves her of the tray sets it down
you want me to move the television set in here
fran shakes her head you play gin rummy
im not very good at it
let me get the cards
you dont have to entertain me
bud opens the bureau drawer takes out a deck of cards a score pad and a pencil
nothing id like better you know togetherness
guess what i did last christmas
had an early dinner at the automat then went to the zoo then i came home and cleaned up after mr
eichelberger he had a little eggnog party here
im way ahead this year
he pulls a chair up to the bed starts to shuffle the cards
three across spades double high deals
they cut eight ten
he starts to deal pensively i think im going to give it all up
give what up
why do people have to love people anyway
yeah i know what you mean
flips over down card queen
i dont want it

she does and they start playing
what do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents
a bad insurance risk
nodding thats me with men
ive been jinxed from the word go first time i was ever kissed was in a cemetery
i was fifteen we used to go there to smoke
his name was george he threw me over for a drum majorette
he spreads his hand
fran lays her cards down and bud adds them up
thirty six and twenty five thats sixty one and two boxes
enters score on pad i just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time
shuffling how many guys were there
holding up four fingers three
the last one was manager of a finance company back home in pittsburgh they found a little shortage in his accounts but he asked me to wait for him hell
be out in
pushing the deck toward her cut
she does and he starts dealing so i came to new york and moved in with my sister and her husband he drives a cab
they sent me to secretarial school and i applied for a job with consolidated but i flunked the typing test too slow
i can type up a storm but i cant spell
so they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator thats how i met jeff her eyes mist up and she puts her cards down
oh god im so fouled up
what am i going to do now
you better win a hand youre on a blitz
was he really upset when you told him
maybe he does love me only he doesnt have the nerve to tell his wife
im sure thats the explanation
you really think so
no doubt about it
a thoughtful beat then can i have that pad and the pencil
handing her score pad and pencil what for
im going to write a letter to mrs
as one woman to another im sure shell understand miss kubelik i dont think thats such a good idea
he gently takes the pad and pencil away from her
well for one thing you cant spell
and secondly if you did something like that youd hate yourself
fighting back tears i dont like myself very much anyway
pick up your cards and lets go
do i have to
i got a terrific hand
fran her eyes drooping sleepily picks up her cards makes a discard
you sure you want to throw that card
he removes the cards from her hand starts to add them up
fifty two and twenty five thats seventy seven spades is double a hundred and fifty four and four boxes youre blitzed in two games
he enters the score on the pad
as he starts to shuffle again he notices that fran has slid down on the pillow and that her eyes are closed she is asleep
bud rises adjusts the blanket over her
he stands there looking at her for a moment runs his hand over his chin
realizing he needs a shave he crosses to the bathroom
in the bathroom bud washes his face squirts some shaving cream into his hand starts to apply it
a volkswagen draws up to the curb in front of the house
kirkeby gets out on the street side sylvia squeezes herself out through the other door
kirkeby raises the front hood of the volkswagen reaches into the luggage compartment takes out a cardboard bucket with a bottle of champagne on ice
together he and sylvia start up the steps of the house sylvia already cha cha ing in anticipation
in the bathroom bud has just finished lathering his face when the doorbell rings
he starts into the bedroom
muttering to himself all right all right mrs
he glances at the sleeping fran picks up the tray carries it into the living room pulling the bedroom door closed behind him
but it doesnt shut completely because of frans dress hooked over the top
bud crosses to the hall door opens it
outside are kirkeby with the champagne bucket and sylvia
blocking the door what do you want
what do i
to sylvia just a minute
he pushes his way into the apartment past bud
you cant come in
closing the door behind him whats the matter with you buddy boy
i made a reservation for four oclock remember
he heads for the coffee table sets the champagne down
bud shoots a quick glance toward the bedroom door gets rid of the tray
look you cant stay here
just take your champagne and go
baxter i dont want to pull rank on you but i told the lady it was all set you want to make a liar out of me
are you going to leave mr
kirkeby or do i have to throw you out
as bud spins him around kirkeby notices the dress on the bedroom door
buddy boy why didnt you say so
indicating dress you got yourself a little playmate huh
now will you get out
outside the door of buds apartment sylvia is cha cha ing impatiently
up the stairs comes dr
dreyfuss in his overcoat and carrying his medical bag
knocking on the door hey come on what are we waiting for
open up will you
she continues cha cha ing
dreyfuss has unlocked the door to his apartment and is watching sylvia appalled by the fact that baxter seems to be at it again
he starts inside
he shuts the door behind him
knocking on baxters door whats holding things up
kirkeby looks toward the door in response to sylvias knocking
say why dont we have ourselves a party the four of us
he forces kirkeby toward the hall door
kirkeby glancing past him through the partly open door of the bedroom catches sight of fran asleep in bed
grinning smugly well i dont blame you
so you hit the jackpot eh kid i mean kubelik wise
bud opens the door gestures him out dont worry
i wont say a word to anybody
kirkeby comes backing out the door of buds apartment minus the champagne bucket
stay with it buddy boy
bud shuts the door on him come on sylvia
a little mixup in signals
leading her toward stairs whats your mother doing this afternoon
shes home stuffing a turkey
why dont we send her to a movie like ben hur
but what are we going to do about grandma and uncle herman and aunt sophie and my two nieces bud comes into the bedroom
as he heads for the bathroom fran stirs slightly opens her eyes
who was that
just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne
shaking her head would you mind opening the window
she turns off the electric blanket as bud crosses to the window pushes it up
then a thought strikes him and he looks at fran suspiciously
now dont go getting any ideas miss kubelik
i just want some fresh air
its only one story down the best you can do is break a leg
so theyll shoot me like a horse
approaching the bed please miss kubelik you got to promise me you wont do anything foolish
sleepily why cant i ever fall in love with somebody nice like you
well thats the way it crumbles cookie wise
go to sleep
fran closes her eyes
bud returns to the bathroom picks up his razor starts to shave
but something seems to be wrong with the razor and unscrewing it he realizes that there is no blade
sheepishly he takes out the blade he hid in his shirt pocket inserts it in his razor screws it shut
then he resumes shaving
it is the morning after christmas and miss olsen and the other girls are just settling down to work
sheldrake in hat and coat approaches from the elevators comes through the glass doors
ad lib good morning mr

he strides into the inner office
miss olsen picks up her stenographic pad follows him in
sheldrake is removing his hat and coat as miss olsen comes in shuts the door behind her

sheldrake looks after her for a moment then goes to his desk picks up the phone dials the operator

baxter in ordinary premium accounting miss olsen has put on her coat and is going through her desk drawers cleaning out her personal belongings nail polish emery boards an extra

as she stows them away in her handbag one of the buttons on the telephone lights up
miss olsen hesitates for a second then with a quick look around she pushes the button down carefully picks up the receiver listens in
sheldrake is dialing the last two digits of a telephone number
after a moment someone answers

bud wearing slacks a shirt open at the neck and a cardigan sweater is at the phone
a pillow and a blanket on the living room couch indicate where he spent the night
looking off yes shes in the shower shes coming along fine considering

fran nods watches him go out
then she glances toward the phone which is off the hook
reluctantly she advances toward it picks it up

he hangs up miss olsen hangs up the phone sits there for a moment weighing what she has overheard
then she makes a decision picks up the phone again dials a number
as she waits for an answer she glances toward sheldrakes office
into phone hello mrs
this is miss olsen fine thank you mrs
sheldrake i was wondering if we could have lunch together
well i dont know how important it is but i think you might find it educational it concerns your husband all right one oclock at longchamps madison and th
she looks up as the door to the inner office opens and sheldrake comes out
he stops when he sees that miss olsen is still there
hanging up phone dont worry im on my way
she rises i was just making a personal call
she opens her handbag takes out a coin puts it down on the desk
heres a dime
she marches out through the glass doors toward the elevators as sheldrake stands there watching her
bud comes down the street carrying a large brown paper bag overflowing with groceries
he goes up the steps of the house and through the front door
as bud starts up the stairs with the groceries mrs
lieberman comes hurrying down toward him
breathlessly oh mr
baxter im glad youre here i was just going to get the passkey
i thought i smelled gas coming from your apartment
he races up the stairs two at a time fumbling frantically for his key
reaching the door of his apartment he unlocks it dashes in
bud comes bursting through the door
the living room is empty and the bedclothes have been removed from the couch
calling miss kubelik
he dumps the bag of groceries on a table rushes into the kitchen
the burner has been turned on under the kettle but there is no flame and gas is hissing from the vents
bud snaps it off starts out again
meanwhile fran has appeared from the bathroom and is approaching the bedroom door
she is still in her robe and is holding a double sock stretcher with one of buds socks on it
bud rounding the corner from the kitchen at full speed collides with fran in the bedroom doorway
he grabs her arms with obvious relief
are you all right
sniffs whats that funny smell
indicating kitchen didnt you turn it on
i was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress
accusingly you turned it on but you didnt light it
are you supposed to
in this house youre supposed to
bud starts to take off his hat and coat notices the sock stretcher in her hand
what are you doing with that
i was washing my stockings so i decided i might as well do your socks
its very curious i could only find three and a half pair
well things are a little disorganized around here
he carries the bag of groceries into the kitchen fran trailing after him
during the following he removes the contents of the bag bread eggs bacon spaghetti ground round frankfurters and assorted canned goods sets them out on the drainboard
whats a tennis racquet doing in the kitchen
she produces the racquet from behind the stove
oh i remember i was cooking myself an italian dinner
fran looks at him oddly i used it to strain the spaghetti
thinking it over why not
as a matter of fact im a pretty good cook but im a lousy housekeeper
yes you are indicating the living room when i was straightening up the couch you know what i found
six hairpins a lipstick a pair of false eyelashes and a swizzle stick from the stork club
shrugging its just that im the kind of guy who cant say no i dont mean to girls i mean you mean to someone like mr
i guess so
i know so
hes a taker
some people take some people get took and they know theyre getting took and theres nothing they can do about it
i wouldnt say that trying to change the subject what would you like to have for diner
theres onion soup and canned asparagus i really ought to be getting home
my family will be flipping by now
she starts into the living room
bud follows her
you cant leave yet
the doctor says it takes forty eight hours to get the stuff out of your system
wistfully i wonder how long it takes to get someone youre stuck on out of your system
if theyd only invent some kind of a pump for that she sits on the arm of a chair
i know how you feel miss kubelik
you think its the end of the world but its not really
i went through exactly the same thing myself
well maybe not exactly i tried to do it with a gun
over a girl
worse than that she was the wife of my best friend and i was mad for her
but i knew it was hopeless so i decided to end it all
i went to a pawnshop and bought a forty five automatic and drove up to eden park do you know cincinnati
no i dont
anyway i parked the car and loaded the gun well you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves but believe me its not that easy i
mean how do you do it
here or here or here with cocked finger he points to his temple mouth and chest you know where i finally shot myself
indicating kneecap here
in the knee
while i was sitting there trying to make my mind up a cop stuck his head in the car because i was illegally parked so i started to hide the
gun under the seat and it went off pow
laughing thats terrible
took me a year before i could bend my knee but i got over the girl in three weeks
she still lives in cincinnati has four kids gained twenty pounds she sends me a fruit cake every christmas
suddenly suspicious are you just making that up to make me feel better
of course not
heres the fruit cake
shows it to her under christmas tree and you want to see my knee
starts to raise pant leg no thanks
the fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how i found out
so let em
look im going to cook dinner for us
well have the fruit cake for dessert
you just sit there and rest
youve done enough for one day
smiling yes nurse
bud starts happily into the kitchen
it is mid afternoon and traffic is light
a yellow cab has pulled up in front of the entrance and the driver a stockily built young man in a leather jacket and cap gets out and comes through
the revolving doors into the lobby
his name is karl matuschka and he is frans brother in law
as he cases the elevators the starter comes up to him
can i help you
im looking for one of the elevator girls miss kubelik
so am i
she didnt report this morning
where can i get some information whos in charge here
that comes under general office administration
dobisch twenty first floor
he steps into an elevator the doors of which are just closing
dobisch is sitting behind his desk lighting a cigar
kirkeby who has dropped in for a little visit is perched on the edge of the desk
so yesterday afternoon i take sylvia up to the apartment and guess who hes got stashed away in the bedroom
buddy boy and kubelik having themselves a little toot
its more like a lost weekend
neither of them showed up for work today
what gripes me is the two of them were guzzling my champagne while sylvia and i wound up at the guggenheim museum
the glass door opens and matuschka comes in
my name is karl matuschka my sister in law she runs one of the elevators here fran kubelik
exchanging a glance with dobisch miss kubelik
you know her
there may be a lot of employees here but were one big happy family
well she lives with us and my wife shes getting a little nervous on account of fran hasnt been home for two days
another look at dobisch that so
anyway we was wondering if somebody in the office would know what happened to her
to kirkeby what do you think al
can we help the man
after a pregnant pause why not
we dont owe buddy boy anything
whats buddy boy done for us lately
scowling who is buddy boy
buddy boy is bending over a hot stove preparing an italian dinner
he takes a saucepan of spaghetti off the fire and picking up the tennis racquet with the other hand pours the spaghetti on top of the racquet strings
then he turns on the faucet runs water over the spaghetti
with the combined technique of brillat savarin and pancho gonzales he gently agitates the racquet letting the water drain off the spaghetti
as he works he hums a theme from tschaikowskys capriccio italien
fran walks in still in her robe
are we dressing for dinner
no just come as you are
watching him say youre pretty good with that racquet
you ought to see my backhand
dumping spaghetti into platter and wait till i serve the meatballs
demonstrates shall i light the candles
its a must gracious living wise
as fran starts into the living room bud begins to ladle meat sauce onto the spaghetti humming operatically
in the living room the small table has been set for two and prominent on it is the champagne bottle that mr
kirkeby left behind still in its cardboard bucket but freshly iced
as fran lights the candles she notices the napkins on the table peels a price tag off the corner of one of them
i see you bought some napkins
might as well go all the way
he carries the platter of spaghetti and meat sauce in from the kitchen sets it on the table sprinkles some cheese on it
then he crosses to the coffee table where a full martini pitcher stands in readiness fills a couple of glasses
fran seats herself at the table
you know i used to live like robinson crusoe shipwrecked among eight million people
then one day i saw a footprint in the sand and there you were hands her martini its a wonderful thing dinner for two
you usually eat alone
sometimes i have dinner with ed sullivan sometimes with dinah shore or perry como the other night i had dinner with mae west of course she was much younger then
you know what were going to do after dinner
i mean after that
you dont have to if you dont want to i dont
were going to finish that gin game
so i want you to keep a clear head
the door bell rings
carrying his martini glass bud crosses to the door starts to open it
because i dont want to take advantage of you the way i did yesterday in bed
by now the door is open and bud is speaking to fran over his shoulder
he turns finds himself face to face with karl matuschka who is standing grimly in the doorway
matuschka shoves him roughly aside strides past him toward fran who has risen to her feet
whats with you fran did you forget where you live
to bud this is my brother in law karl matuschka
friendly how do you do mr
pushing bud away to fran okay get your clothes on
i got the cab downstairs
now wait a minute
i know what youre thinking but its not as bad as it looks shoving him away its none of my business what you do fran youre over twenty one but
your sister happens to think youre a lady
all we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes grabbing him look buddy boy if there wasnt a lady present id clobber you
separating them all right karl ill get dressed
she exits into the bedroom removing her dress from the door and closing it
matuschka leans against the wall beside the hall door eyeing bud truculently
bud raises a finger to remonstrate with him then breaks into a nervous ingratiating smile
care for a martini
matuschka continues glaring at him how about a little spaghetti with meat sauce
made it myself
matuschka just scowls your sister in law sure is terrific realizes his mistake switching abruptly must be murder driving a cab in new york i mean with all that cross
town traffic he gestures with the martini glass spilling the contents over his shirtfront
through the partly open hall door dr
dreyfuss sticks his head in
he steps into the apartment passing matuschka without seeing him
hows the patient
quickly oh im fine doc
not you miss kubelik
stepping forward whats the matter with miss kubelik
oh this is mr
matuschka hes miss kubeliks hes got a cab downstairs to dreyfuss fran been sick or something
dreyfuss looks at bud
no no just had a little accident
to dreyfuss what does he mean accident
well these things happen all the time what things
grabbing dreyfuss say what kind of doctor are you anyway
hastily oh not that kind
he just gave her a shot and pumped her stomach out behind them the bedroom door has opened and fran comes out wearing her coat over her dress
coming up because i took some sleeping pills
but im all right now so lets go
why did you take sleeping pills
promptly on account of me
whirling on him you
matuschka lashes out with a left to buds jaw and while he is off balance catches him with a right to the eye
bud falls back against the christmas tree which topples with a crash
fran pulls matuschka away from him
leave him alone karl
she kneels beside bud
tenderly you fool you damn fool
come on fran
she kisses him on the cheek rises starts toward the door
she follows matuschka out
bud looks after her starry eyed
i dont want to gloat but just between us you had that coming to you
tilts buds chin up examines his eye tch tch tch
are you going to have a shiner tomorrow
let me get my bag
he starts out calling after him dont bother doc
it doesnt hurt a bit
he is on cloud nine
bud is coming from the elevators toward his office
he is wearing his chesterfield bowler and a pair of dark glasses
he opens the office door starts in
bud crosses directly to the phone removes his glasses revealing a swollen left eye
he dials a number
into phone mr
this is c
would you please tell mr
sheldrake id like to come up and see him
its rather important
will you call me back please
he hangs up takes off his hat and coat deposits them on the clothes tree
then he paces around the office rehearsing a speech out loud
sheldrake ive got good news for you
all your troubles are over
im going to take miss kubelik off your hands
nods to himself with satisfaction the plain fact is mr
sheldrake that i love her
i havent told her yet but i thought you should be the first to know
after all you dont really want her and i do and although it may sound presumptuous she needs somebody like me
so i think it would be the thing all around the phone rings and he picks it up solution wise
into phone yes
ill be right up
he hangs up crosses to the door opens it
to himself mr
sheldrake ive got good news for you putting on his dark glasses he heads for the elevators still talking to himself
kirkeby and dobisch are just stepping out of an elevator when bud approaches
they grin smugly when they see that he is wearing dark glasses
hi buddy boy
what happened to you
hit by a swinging door
or maybe a yellow cab
bud pays no attention walks right past them into the elevator still muttering to himself
the doors close
as they move away from the elevators that guy really mustve belted him
yeah hes punchy
talking to himself
the elevator doors open
bud steps out
as he heads for sheldrakes office he continues rehearsing his speech
you see mr
sheldrake those two days she spent in the apartment it made me realize how lonely id been before
but thanks to you im in a financial position to marry her if i can ever square things with her family
he opens the door to sheldrakes anteroom
sheldrake is pacing in front of his desk
a couple of suitcases are standing in a corner of the room
the intercom buzzes and sheldrake presses the lever down
baxter is here
send him in
a beat then the door opens and bud marches in determinedly
sheldrake ive got good news for you and ive got good news for you baxter
all your troubles are over
reacting to the echo sir
i know how worried you were about miss kubelik well stop worrying im going to take her off your hands
stunned youre going to take her off my hands
indicating suitcases ive moved out of my house im going to be staying in town at the athletic club
you left your wife
well if you must know i fired my secretary my secretary got to my wife and my wife fired me
aint that a kick in the head
yeah now what was your news baxter
recovering with difficulty its about miss kubelik shes all right again so she went back home
and dont think ive forgotten what you did for me
opens door to adjoining office this way baxter
bud advances slowly toward the door
it is a slightly smaller and less lavish edition of sheldrake s office
sheldrake ushers bud through the door points to the chair behind the desk
try it on for size
bud obeys like an automaton lowers himself into the chair
indicating office its all yours
my assistant roy thompson has been shifted to the denver office and youre taking his place
no reaction from bud whats the matter baxter
you dont seem very excited
well its just that so many things have been happening so fast im very pleased especially for miss kubelik
now that ive gotten to know her better i think shes the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody oh sure sure
but first the property settlement has to be worked out then it takes six weeks in reno meanwhile im going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while
starts back toward his own office oh by the way you can now have lunch in the executive dining room yes sir
he removes his dark glasses reflectively
thats just one of the privileges that goes with this job
you also get a nice little expense account the use of the executive washroom breaks off peers at buds face say what happened to you baxter
i got kicked in the head too
with a shrug he exits into his own office closing the door behind him
bud sits there unconsciously bending the glasses in his hand until they suddenly snap in two
bud glances down at the two broken halves as though surprised by his own violence tosses them on the desk
we are close on the building directory
listed under personnel is j
sheldrake director and just below that a mans hand is inserting the name c
baxter in the slot marked asst
the lettering is complete except for the final r
camera pulls back to reveal the sign painter we saw earlier working on the directory
watching him is bud
he is wearing his chesterfield and bowler and still has a slight welt under his left eye
it is after six oclock and there is very little activity in the lobby
fran wearing her coat over street clothes approaches from the direction of the elevators stops when she sees bud
good evening mr
bud turns to her in surprise removes his bowler
oh miss kubelik
how do you feel
hows your eye
there is a moment of constraint between them
hows everything at the apartment
you know we never finished that gin game i know
a beat i suppose you heard about mr
you mean leaving his wife
im very happy for you
i never thought hed do it
i told you all along
you see you were wrong about mr
i guess so
for that matter you were wrong about me too
what you said about those who take and those who get took
sheldrake wasnt using me i was using him
indicating his name on directory last month i was at desk on the nineteenth floor now im on the twenty seventh floor paneled office three windows so it all worked
out fine were both getting what we want
looks at her watch you walking to the subway
no thank you
fumbling i well to tell you the truth glancing around lobby i have this heavy date for tonight he points off toward the newsstand
standing there is a tall attractive brunette obviously waiting for someone
fran looks off in the indicated direction
arent you meeting mr
you know how people talk
so i decided it would be better if we didnt see each other till everything is settled divorce wise
thats very wise
good night mr
good night miss kubelik
fran walks toward the revolving doors
bud watches her for a moment then strides briskly across the lobby toward the newsstand
he goes right past the waiting brunette stops in front of a rack of pocket books examines the merchandise
a man now comes out of a phone booth joins the waiting brunette and they go off together
bud picks out a couple of paperbacks pays the clerk behind the counter
stuffing a book into each coat pocket he moves slowly toward the revolving doors
sheldrake is swiveled around sideways behind his desk with a bootblack kneeling in front of him shining his shoes
reaching for the intercom sheldrake presses down one of the levers
baxter would you mind stepping in her for a minute
the bootblack finishes the second shoe with a flourish gathers up his equipment
sheldrake tosses him a half dollar
he exits into the anteroom as the door of the adjoining office opens and bud comes in carrying several charts
there is no trace left of his black eye
putting charts on desk heres the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover
thirty seven percent of our female employees leave to get married twenty two percent quit because breaking in youre working too hard baxter
its new years eve relax
i suppose youll be on the town tonight celebrating
im taking miss kubelik out i finally talked her into it i see
the only thing is im staying at the athletic club and its strictly stag so if you dont mind dont mind what
you know that other key to your apartment well when we had that little scare about miss kubelik i thought id better get rid of it quick so i threw
it out the window of the commuter train
now ill have to borrow your key
what do you mean sorry
youre not going to bring anybody up to my apartment
im not just bringing anybody im bringing miss kubelik
especially not miss kubelik
hows that again
flatly no key
baxter i picked you for my team because i thought you were a bright young man
you realize what youre doing
not to me but to yourself
normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty seventh floor but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again
nodding slowly i dig
so whats it going to be
without taking his eyes off sheldrake bud reaches into his pocket fishes out a key drops it on the desk
now youre being bright
thank you sir
he turns abruptly starts back into his own office
bud comes in shutting the door behind him stands rooted to the spot for a moment
then he takes some pencils out of his breast pocket and drops them into a container on the desk closes his account book slams a couple of open file drawers
as he crosses to the clothes closet the connecting door opens and sheldrake comes in key in hand
say baxter you gave me the wrong key
no i didnt
holding it out but this is the key to the executive washroom
thats right mr
i wont be needing it because im all washed up around here
he has taken his chesterfield and bowler out of the closet and is putting the coat on
whats gotten into you baxter
just following doctors orders
ive decided to become a mensch
you know what that means
a human being
now hold on baxter save it
the old payola wont work any more
he opens the door to the anteroom starts out
bud comes out of his office carrying his bowler strides past the secretaries and through the glass doors to the foyer
an elevator is just unloading and beside it a handyman is cleaning out one of the cigarette receptacles
bud crosses to the elevator and as he passes the handyman he jams his bowler on the mans head surrendering his crown so to speak
the elevator doors close
the handyman straightens up looks around in bewilderment
bud is in the process of packing
in the middle of the living room are several large cardboard cartons filled with his possessions
the art posters are off the walls the bric a brac has been removed from the shelves and bud is stowing away the last of his books and records
he crosses to the fireplace opens one of the drawers in the cabinet above it takes out a forty five automatic
he holds the gun in the palm of his hand studies it appraisingly
the doorbell rings
bud snaps out of his reverie drops the gun into one of the cartons goes to the door and opens it
standing outside is dr
dreyfuss with a plastic ice bucket in his hand
say baxter were having a little party and we ran out of ice so i was wondering sure doc
stepping inside how come youre alone on new years eve
well i have things to do noticing cartons whats this you packing
yeah im giving up the apartment
he goes into the kitchen opens the refrigerator starts to pry out the ice cube trays
where are you moving to
i dont know
all i know is i got to get out of this place
sorry to lose you baxter
oh you mean my body
dont worry doc itll go to the university ill put it in writing he dumps the ice cubes still in their trays into the bucket dr
dreyfuss is holding
then he pulls kirkebys unopened bottle of champagne out of the refrigerator
can you use a bottle of champagne
booze we dont need
why dont you join us baxter
we got two brain surgeons an ear nose and throat specialist a proctologist and three nurses from bellevue
no thanks i dont feel like it
look doc in case i dont see you again how much do i owe you for taking care of that girl
forget it i didnt do it as a doctor i did it as a neighbor
stopping in doorway by the way whatever happened to her
airily you know me with girls
easy come easy go
happy new year
bud closes the door returns to the kitchen brings out a box of glassware and the tennis racquet
as he starts to deposit the racquet in a carton he notices a strand of spaghetti clinging to the strings
he removes it gently stands there twirling the limp spaghetti absently around his finger
it is five minutes before midnight new years eve
sitting alone in the last booth is fran a paper hat on her head a pensive look on her face
there are two champagne glasses on the table and the usual noisemakers but the chair opposite her is empty
above the general hubbub the chinese pianist can be heard playing
after a moment fran glances off
threading his way through the merrymakers crowding the bar and overflowing from the booths is sheldrake
he is in dinner clothes topped by a paper hat
reaching the last booth he drops into the chair facing fran
sorry it took me so long on the phone
but were all set
all set for what
i rented a car its going to be here at one oclock were driving to atlantic city
i know its a drag but you cant find a hotel room in town not on new years eve
a long look at sheldrake ring out the old year ring in the new
ring a ding ding
i didnt plan it this way fran actually its all baxters fault
he wouldnt give me the key to the apartment
just walked out on me quit threw that big fat job right in my face
a faint smile the nerve
that little punk after all i did for him
he said i couldnt bring anybody to his apartment especially not miss kubelik
whats he got against you anyway
a faraway look in her eye i dont know
i guess thats the way it crumbles cookie wise
what are you talking about
id spell it out for you only i cant spell
the piano player is consulting the watch on his upraised left arm
he drops the arm in a signal and the lights go out
at the same time he strikes up auld lang syne
all over the dimly lit room couples get to their feet embracing and joining in the song
in the last booth sheldrake leans across the table kisses fran
happy new year fran
frans expression is preoccupied
sheldrake faces in the direction of the pianist and holding his glass aloft sings along with the others
as auld lang syne comes to an end the place explodes noisily there is a din of horns ratchets and shouted greetings
the lights come up again
in the last booth sheldrake turns back toward fran but she is no longer there
her paper hat lies abandoned on her vacated chair
fran looking around where are you fran
he rises cranes his neck trying to spot her in the crowd
fran a coat thrown over the dress she was wearing at the rickshaw comes down the street almost at a run
there is a happy expectant look on her face
she hurries up the steps of the house and through the front door
fran mounts the stairs eagerly
as she reaches the landing and heads for buds apartment there is a loud sharp report from inside
fran freezes momentarily then rushes to the door
pounding on door mr
the door opens and there stands bud the bottle of champagne he has just uncorked still foaming over in his hand
he stares at fran unbelievingly
sagging with relief are you all right
are you sure
hows your knee
im fine all over
mind if i come in
still stunned of course not
fran comes in and bud shuts the door
the room is the same as we left it except for an empty champagne glass standing on the coffee table
let me get another glass
he goes to one of the cartons takes out a champagne glass wrapped in newspaper starts to unwrap it
looking around where are you going
another neighborhood another town another job im on my own
thats funny so am i
bud pouring champagne looks up at her what did you do with the cards
indicating carton in there
fran takes the deck of cards and the gin rummy score pad out of the carton settles herself on the couch starts to shuffle the cards expertly
what about mr
im going to send him a fruit cake every christmas
bud sinks down happily on the couch and fran holds out the deck to him
bud cuts a card but doesnt look at it
i love you miss kubelik
cutting a card seven looking at buds card queen
she hands the deck to bud
did you hear what i said miss kubelik
i absolutely adore you
smiling shut up and deal
bud begins to deal never taking his eyes off her
fran removes her coat starts picking up her cards and arranging them
bud a look of pure joy on his face deals and deals and keeps dealing
and thats about it
