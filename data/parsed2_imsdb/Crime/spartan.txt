a screenplay by david mamet copyright c by david mamet we see the drawn face of a young woman
camera tracks with her as she runs through the thick woods
she is exerting herself heavily as she moves up a steep hillside
she looks behind her quickly and continues
angle we see a young man and then another running through the woods out of breath
they are dressed in filthy bdus and show several days growth of beard
the leader stops for a moment and looks around
the two men separate
angle the young woman who has come to a small ledge over a ravine
she stops panting and bends over to attempt to catch her breath
she looks around and looks back her back to a steep wall a steep drop before her
angle the first young man having come up to the spot vacated by the young woman
in the bg we see his colleague
he looks down and sees movement in the brush below him in the ravine
he starts to descend and then looks up
angle the young woman pulling herself up the steep rockface
the young man regains the ledge and looks up
camera takes him around a bend in the ledge
standing here we discover robert scott
he is somewhat older than the two men he is very fit also dressed in filthy bdus
he is making a note in a small notebook which he closes
now the two men look across the ravine at the young woman seen disappearing over a ridge
quietly you better catch her
the man looks around and begins climbing up the rockface behind him pulling himself up hand over hand by the roots of trees
several feet up he falls on his back
he tries to work himself to his knees and winces in pain
he looks to scott for help
your dads napping on the sofa your moms watching lets make a deal and god is dead
what do you expect me to do
very weakly im tired sir
sir theres no way
theres always a way
dont you tell me theres no way
a pause as the man tries again to get to his feet
scott looks up at the young woman on top of the ridge and gives her a hold gesture
she stops at his command
scott nods as if to himself and then kicks the young man in the ribs
the man starts his eyes grow and he gets to his feet
how bout that
thats called adrenaline
you said you wanted in
he moves into the now standing young man and hits him not heavily but convincingly several times
this is where you get in
the mugger dont care
the shooter dont care
or i will beat you to death on this fucken hill
now you better catch her
he motions with his head
in the bg we see the young woman nod and begin running again
we see her for a moment breast a hill and disappear again
angle on the young man as he looks at scott empty now of self pity as if he just realized something
responding to his look
as if to say thats right
theres nothing but the mission
the young man begins to climb the rockface
hold on scott for a moment
a large hand painted sign hangs on the cinderblock wall of the rough building
it reads these are the precincts of pain
a goddess lives here
her name is victory
in front of the sign walks the young woman we saw earlier
she is exhausted she has a towel wrapped around her neck
camera takes her to scott who is holding a cup of coffee and making notes in the small notebook we saw earlier
she stands waiting as she finishes his note
a signal honor to work with you sir
thank you sergeant
he starts away from her and she raises her hand slightly to indicate she has something more to say
he turns back to her
sir day or night
black or white
you reach out for me
black jaqueline a
ill remember sergeant
she nods and walks off
scott walks toward a mess tent
he is joined by george blane a very military looking figure of an older man
he wears an informal fatigue outfit mismatched jacket and trousers without insignia
scott is greeted by him as they walk toward the mess tent
scott shows the notebook to blane and blane refers from the notebook to what we see are a group of eighty young men in the mess tent two of them
the men we saw on the hill
blane takes the notebook and walks off as scott enters the mess tent
angle his pov scott enters the tent
several of the young men react to him
he nods to them
among them we see the young man scott berated on the hill who rises and comes over to scott
angle on scott who sits as a uniformed man brings him a tinfoil tray with some food on it
scott takes out a stiletto from his pocket presses a button and the blade emerges
he begins to use it to cut up his meat
the young man from the hill anton stands sheepishly near scott till scott turns acknowledging him
anton takes a card out of his pocket the size of a credit card old creased cardboard it reads rogers rangers rules for engagement
there is a line drawing of a man with a musket and we read on the card beneath it boldtype rules for fighting guerilla style
written on the card in old faded ink sgt
united states special forces
the young man anton shows the card to scott
of the card whats this then
it was my fathers sir
he carry it over there
as they speak we see in an insert the printed rules dated
rule tell the truth about what you see and what you do there is an army depending on us for correct information
you can lie all you please when you tell other folks about the rangers but dont never lie to a ranger or an officer
he come back
pause well so
scott pauses again
as he looks at the young man who is obviously unable to express his gratitude and sense of occasion
you carry that card son
it might save your life
anton nods you could use it to light a fire or something
blanes aide calls the men to order
the candidate cadre will fall in on the white line
the men start to come to their feet and leave the mess tent
i just wanted to say sir
that to meet you
rising as he gives the ranger card back to anton you never met me
youve been up for a week
youre seeing snakes
the exhausted men come to their feet and into a line
they are happy and joking with one another
in the bg we see those who failed the course sitting apart file onto a bus which has just pulled up
angle on a young man who looks out of the window
angle his pov
twenty or so similarly exhausted men with dufflebags are being shuffled onto the bus
angle on the young man anton as he exits the tent who stands next to scott outside the tent
scott stands next to an old but pristine mustang cobra
he withdraws a small dufflebag from the front seat and looks up to see anton standing next to him
looking after the departing failed men i cant imagine how they live with it
angle on scott
as he thinks a very brief moment as if reluctant to become philosophical and then turns back to anton
make sure you cant imagine it cause if you can its just one step to doing it
anton shakes his head sadly at the spectacle of the failed men
pause theyll be back where they came from by morning and all this is just a bad dream
my name is
do i need to know
pause if i want camaraderie ill join the masons
then summing it all up theres just the mission
anton steps away
as he glances down at his clipboard congratulations on completion of this evolution
i know you would probably like some sleep but i do not think youd mind sparing ten minutes for induction
the camera pans over the smiling faces of the eight very proud young men
angle on blane and scott off to the side
beyond them we see the bus holding the failed candidates filling up
thank you bobby
not at all sir
you going home
weather permitting sir
in the distance
as camera tracks with blane and scott as i call your names he consults his clipboard grossler anton
these two men steps forward
angle on anton nodding to himself at the proudest moment of his life
angle cu scott looking at him
camera takes blane and scott into a cinderblock building which houses a shooting range
we see various housefronts and storefronts and targets
a long table along one wall holds a coffee urn
blane draws two cups of coffee
through the open door we see anton and grossler smiling entering the building
anton comes into the room and smiles at scott
we see scott look away sadly
he shares a look with blane drains his coffee cup crumples it throws it away
blane gestures to scott meaning shall we begin
scott hesitates for a moment and then nods
angle on scott in the bg as blane steps forward to address the two candidates
over his shoulder to an aide would you bolt the door please
scott gestures to the aide one moment
to the candidates are you tired gentlemen
the two young men smile this is the completion of the evolution beat only one of you may join the unit
the first man through that door will be inducted
he gestures at a far door in the room
angle on scott as he looks at the candidates as they get the picture
to himself quietly yeah

cu scott as he looks interrogating the two men weighing them as they look at each other
grossler starts to advance on anton in a fighting crouch
scott gestures to the aide that that was what he wanted to see
the aide lets scott out of the back door
scott showered in civilian clothes a lumberjacket and jeans comes out of the building carrying a small yellow duffle bag
he opens the trunk
he takes the yellow bag and puts it into the trunk which we now see contains woodworking tools old levels and planes and saws
he closes the trunk
we see the young woman from the first sequence now in civilian clothes conferring with a colleague
she nods at him and he responds
as he starts to get into the car
a squad of exhausted men is marching past
as they come to a halt one of the men turns in the direction of scott
to that man what the hell are you looking at
there aint nobody there
a young worker in a hardhat by a large gravel pit at which we find several earthmovers idle
he is standing by a high chainlink fence topped with barbed wire

the young worker enters the trailer hurriedly and opens a cabinet which we see contains several assault rifles and grenades

the young worker picks up this phone quickly
into phone frontgate
we see his face grow serious as he begins to write on a pad
scott driving comes around a bend
angle his pov

we see the young worker come out of the trailer and stand in the road giving a stop signal to the car
we see scott bring the mustang to a stop and get inquisitively out of the car
we see the young worker run up to him and hand him a sheet of paper
scott takes the paper and begins to read
he looks up to ask a question of the young worker
we see the worker begin to respond his body language saying thats all i know
as he starts to speak his words are drowned out by the sound of a helicopter
scott looks up
angle his pov

a man in civilian clothes points out scott on the ground to the pilot

he was very close to his daughter wasnt he
well indeed he saw her the day

scott rested clean shaved drinking a cup of coffee
sitting across a desk from an interrogator who has several notes in front of him

pointing behind him you and your friend
the trainee lets his attention drift for a second in the direction the lecturer has pointed
and the lecturer screams steps in disarms the trainee throwing him to the mat
as the trainee picks himself up the lecturer turns to the class
there are two ways to fight you can fight fair or you can fight to win
the trainee puts his hand to his head and discovers he is bleeding
the lecturer nods his permission and the trainee walks to a water cooler next to which scott is standing
scott looks at the shamed trainee

we hear the phone ringing

scott stops speaking and looks down at something
angle his pov
across the street
we see an unmarked sedan pull up and two men get out of the car
and begin to look around
one sees scott and motions to the other one and they both start in his direction
they stop for a moment as if confused
angle their pov
the street corner empty of scott
coming into the square

the figure of anton walking from the far side of the square toward the phone booth
angle on anton as he looks around him and then proceeds toward the phone booth
as scott watches a van pulls into the plaza and heads toward anton
anton sees the van and retreats toward the streetside where we see the van has herded him toward another car
three men get out of the car one slugs anton and he is whisked into the car and the car pulls away
angle on scott on the far side of the square looking on aghast
angle anton in the backseat of the car pointing back as the car disappears
scott looking at antons gesture and following looking in the direction in which he was pointing
angle scotts pov
the telephone kiosk
scott walks into his pov to the kiosk
he looks down at the pile of trash on the shelf
he looks up at the various pornographic ads pasted around the interior
he sees that stuck in one of them is the rogers rangers card which anton showed him earlier
he pulls it out of the ad to which it is stuck
he looks down at it inquisitively
we read in an insert rule dont ever march home the same way
take a different route so you wont be ambushed
he then sees that there is something else behind the ad
he tears the ad off the kiosk partition and he is rewarded as a folded envelope falls out from behind the ad
he picks up the envelope
we see that it is the old yellowed envelope from the beach house
it is printed hanson marine everything for the boat and we see on it the drawing of the old power boat
we see scott feel the envelope shake it tear off the end and pour something out into his hand
we see his face and then pan down to see the object in the envelope was the red crescent earring seen in all photographs of laura newton
a wind is blowing from the sea
scott turns up the collar of his jacket
we see the house in the bg and scott walking along the patio the sea beyond him
we see him stop and kneel to the piling from which he took the matchbook
he sifts through the sand and gravel at the foot of the piling
the wind blows up the dust and scott stands it is evident he has got a speck in his eye and he tries to extract it blinking and squinting
he turns his head
angle his pov
beyond the property line
beyond the hedges and on what is obviously the next lot an old ramshackle dwelling the small white toolshed
angle scott looking at the toolshed and gauging its proximity to the essex house
he begins to walk toward it

he stands he takes out a small spotters scope
his shoulder rubbing against the pollen covered window in the small white shed has uncovered a bit of a sign
scott looking at the sign in the window
he rubs the pollen off and we see emerge on the inside of the window drawn in the dust the picasso sign

up with an automatic pistol
angle the door as we see the door handle move slightly
angle on scott as he jerks open the door his pistol at his side
angle his pov
in the doorway beyond we see a bellboy holding a small paper bag looking shocked
scott shoves the bellboy back away from the door and glances both ways down the hall

he begins to look through his pockets

some coins some scraps of paper
a book of matches some crumpled cigarettes
he hands some bills to the bellboy

angle on scott
as he rummages through the pile on the bed
the tv shows photos of laura newton wearing her red crescent earrings
scott picks up a cigarette and the book of matches on the bed
part of the pile shows a tabloid paper a photo of laura an insert of her father weeping at the funeral and the caption goodbye baby
he bends down and picks up the rogers rangers card
and looks at it
he shakes his head
as we see the bellboy leave the room
xcu on scott as he thinks for a moment then speaks
quite a while since my last confession
on the rear face of a hill in a mortar attack
pause and i confessed that i was frightened
pause and i have to confess im frightened now
he smiles weakly nother irregular confession
he raises a shotglass to his lips and drinks
he makes a another one gesture
im about as frightened as im comfortable being
pause and thats why

pause which i suppose was shameful
angle as a waiter comes with a fresh drink
we see that we are in a very dark quiet smoky panelled bar
the waiter leaves and reveals beyond him jackie black the female sergeant we met at the training facility scenes
the waiter looks at her inquiring silently if she wants anything
she shakes her head
now you did me the honor to call me
now you tell me how i might help
pause there int nobody here but two people in green
pause scott looks around he takes up a tabloid newspaper which has been resting on the seat of the booth
we see it is a funeral edition concerning the death of laura newton
we see the large color photo of laura her red hair and in an insert her father at the gravesite hiding his face
the caption reads goodbye baby
scott leans over and whispers to black his deepest secret
pointing at the paper this girls alive
then youd better go get her
scott shaven neat and determined standing at a bus stop
reading a newspaper
behind him a large iron fence
the newspaper shows the tragic death of laura newton and photos of the accident
and a photo of a distraught woman in sunglasses being held up by two friends
angle on scott
as he looks across the street
angle his pov
a plainclothes car with two people in it looking vaguely in his direction
angle on the bus as it pulls into the stop
we see various people start onto the bus
at the last moment scott at the back of the line sheers away
the plainclothes car
the bus pulling away from the bus stop the chainlink fence beyond it and beyond that a vaguely institutional looking colonial building
a nurses station scott moving through the area just asking directions of an older woman obviously a semi invalid
the woman is mrs
she walks with a companion she wears sunglasses and starts out of the sanitorium
as scott walks up some yards behind her following her out onto a roofed porch
the woman moves to the far end of the porch obviously weeping
scott enters the porch and stands for a moment
terrible thing grief
scott turns to her to see a lovely woman in her late fifties sitting on a lounge chair a robe over her legs indicating the weeping woman
scott nods and takes something from his pocket
he starts toward the weeping woman but the other woman holds him with her voice
you want to comfort them but you dont know how
pause i always think its better to leave them alone
scott nods his acceptance of her wisdom and begins to start toward the woman
newton and the woman talking to her a relative
pause can we blame her
he gestures meaning we get comfort where we can find it thats right
scott begins to move toward mrs
the woman on the lounge chair sits up
who are you
moving off united states secret service
the woman moves her blanket to reveal a pistol which she holds
guess again cause im the secret service and you follow my directions or i will shoot you dead
spread your hands to your sides please
scott spreads his hands to his sides open them
he opens his hands to show the red crescent earring
we see the demeanor of the woman in back of him change as she sees the earring
she comes up to scott and he turns around
she looks up asking mutely what it means
sotto unable to stop her invective the motherfuckers pulled the detail off of her
he was in town
her father was in town they pulled the secret service detail off her to take him tomcatting
hes been doing it for years
thats what they do
they turn the secret service into a bunch of pimps
he took her protection she got snatched
hed let her die
a female agent knocks at the door and sticks her head in and donny gestures rotate
leaving the post
donny gestures that she has heard
the agent leaves and the door is closed
meaning this is my surmise the start of a campaign your daughter got kidnapped because you were out getting laid
her father would let her die
who knows if he knows
his people would let her die in a heartbeat
she takes up the earring and she begins to weep
she looks beseechingly at scott im her mother
she takes out a small tattered cheap earring box
we see the empty place for holding two earrings and a small arcade photo of a five year old laura newton and this woman donny fifteen years younger
they are hugging
scott turns over the photo to read in a childish scrawl donny you can keep the box cause ill never take them off
donny starts to weep
i need some money
donny looks up at him questioningly im going to get the girl back

avi takes a photo from his desk and passes it to scott
it shows through a long lens blurry and grainy a photo of what is obviously the platinum haired laura newton sitting on a bed in a barred room
she was there twelve hours ago
who took the photo
shrugs how would i know
what does the bonus cost
shrugs a gesture of friendship
we thought if you see some of the yemenins he shows scott candid photos of several middle aged bearded middle eastern looking men any of these in particular
would you say hello to them
scott scoops up the documents and stands
who else have you done a favor for avi
avi shakes his head and wags his finger as if to say no in all sincerity
bobby the world runs on manners
scott takes an envelope and hands it to avi who opens it
he opens his mouth to speak

we see a small seed fall out
smith turns to the sound and looks inquisitively at scott
as he picks the seed up answering smiths unspoken question its an appleseed

scott reaches over to a box of q tips which sits on the table along with other cleansing paraphernalia and dips one in the solvent bottle and begins to clean

one of them looks around and sees and removes the small wafer thin electronic device from the top of the cistern
he shows it to stoddard who throws it down in disgust
as he followed by his men exit the room
we see the small suv parked around the corner from the warehouse a black clad driver sitting in the car watching the warehouse

as he turns we hear glass breaking and see scott entering through the window behind laura
the bodyguard turns and scott raises a silenced pistol and shoots the bodyguard twice
the bodyguard falls scott moves to him and drags him inside the room
he raises his pistol gesturing shush to laura and moves her toward the window
he uses the rope outside the window to improvise a sling for laura and drapes it over her head and under her arms
scott picks her up and holds her for a moment
she starts to speak
and he answers her question

he hesitates for a moment
we hear another explosion he nods as if to say thats what were waiting for and passes her out of the window and begins lowering her to the ground

laura moves toward him unbuttoning her blouse
i could make you give me the smoke
he slaps her lightly in the face
keep it together
he takes a small hypodermic kit keep it together or im gonna give you a shot and carry you out
she reacts violently to the sight of the needle
then she sits on the bed and cries self pityingly
nobody cares about me
and we take him back to a small shelf near the door
he takes down what we see is an ashtray overfull with yellow brown cigarette butts
he takes the ashtray to the small table takes out his knife and begins shredding the butts and gathering the tobacco into a pile
im just a whore
they wouldnt even come get me

scott looks at the pile of tobacco
he extracts the rogers rangers card from his pocket and looks at it
we read in an insert rule every night youll be told where to meet if surrounded by superior force
angle on scott as he very precisely peels the card into two thin halves and rolls one of the halves into a cigarette using the reclaimed tobacco from the ashtray

as scott lunges after laura the door behind her bursts open and stoddard and an accomplice enter placing laura in the midst of the hangar between stoddard and scott
who stands in front of a large tanker labelled aviation gasoline
leave her alone
to his men dont shoot him dont shoot youll blow the thing sky high
thank god we found you
you know me
i work for mister burch

angle on laura standing between the two men
she is completely confused
she looks from one to another
drugged and groggy he said that he came to get me
she shakes her head in disbelief
then she starts to walk a step toward scott then turns and proceeds toward stoddard
thats right laura
walk away from him
walk to the plane
he cant hurt you now
walk to the plane
he points at his bizjet outside on the tarmac
laura walks unsteadily in the direction pointed and we see a female attendant in a vaguely military getup get out of the plane and begin to walk toward laura
he starts toward laura
and stoddard and his two men interpose themselves between scott and laura who is approaching the plane
stoddards two men approach scott
one draws a knife
angle on scott who hangs his head wearily
he looks down at his empty hands
angle on the man with the knife approaching him
angle on scott straightening himself as if submitting to the inevitable as the man with the knife draws closer
he makes a thrust and covers
scott steps toward him and spits at him full in the face
the man with the knife recoils for a moment and scott disarms him throws him viciously to the concrete floor and stomps on him
scott bends to pick up the knife the man has dropped and turns to face the other man
as he does so he slips on what we see is a large pool of oil on the floor
he goes down heavily
and the second man steps into him as he falls drawing his pistol
the man uses the pistol to cuff scott who is attempting to rise to his knees behind the ear
the man handcuffs scott behind his back
angle on scott shaking his head to clear it as he now struggles to his knees
angle his pov
laura newton walking toward the bizjet
to scott yes

pause to his henchmen wait till she lifts off take him outside and shoot him
as he speaks he moves slightly continuously to get a better view of the girl why cant the girl go home
because shes dead
pause you had to know the secret knowledge
what is the secret knowledge
the secret knowledge is there is no secret knowledge
turns over his shoulder to look at laura walking toward the plane you went beyond what was permitted
and the gods are angry
on the tarmac
laura walking toward the plane the petroleum storage hangar behind her
we see a vaguely military uniformed woman fall into step beside her and take her arm
laura looks at her
we see laura full face and just the shoulder of the woman escorting her
beyond them we hear the engine of the bizjet start up
im so tired
im going to ask you to do just the one more thing
laura looks at her questioningly
im going to ask you now to walk away from this plane and come with me
angle to show that the stewardess who descended from the bizjet the vaguely military clad young woman we saw earlier is still on station outside of the bizjet and that
the woman who is walking and talking with laura is jackie black the young female sergeant we met earlier
laura looks at her uncomprehendingly
laura begins shaking her head pathetically and protesting drawing away from jackie black

the henchman hoists scott to his feet angle on laura and jackie black

angle xcu on laura as she looks at jackie who now moves laura away from the bizjet and towards the assemblage of newspeople who are on the tarmac around the
global news jet

in the moment he is distracted
scott breaks the mans grip and his arm
he knees the man and kicks him to the ground
the global jet
the news crew reacts to the shot
beyond them we see jackie fallen to the tarmac and laura is walking toward the newspeople
gimme an uplink gimme an uplink

now now now
inside the jet we see various monitors and one switches from an innocuous travelogue to the scene at the airport and the caption live
we see the shot is taken from inside the plane
we see laura stumbling toward the bizjet and see the female reporter run out of the plane and move her to safety inside the cabin
to the unseen cameraman on her
on her get it on the girl
get us out of here
the camera shifts to the image of laura newton going out live
behind her we hear the crew shooting commands and see the door to the global jet close as the jet begins to taxi
the petroleum hangar
we see stoddard reloading his pistol
in the bg we see scott step through his handcuffs that is bring them in front of his body
he takes a pistol from the henchman who is writing on the floor
he raises the pistol and shoots the henchman
he turns on stoddard
