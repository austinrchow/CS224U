b if window
href b b panic room by david koepp by david koepp february this film is short
this film is fast
the whole island from the south
for a second
closer just the skyline
for another second
closer still the upper west side
for another second
no time to waste admiring the scenery
race across a field of pedestrians to pick up three women hurrying down the sidewalk
lydia lynch a real estate broker vaults down the sidewalk shes got a hell of a stride
meg altman thirtyish struggles to keep up with her shes tall wafer thin pale as a ghost
sarah a nine year old girl flat out runs to keep up dribbling a basketball as she goes
the kids athletic much tougher than meg who she resembles
lydia reads from a sheet she carries in her bouncing hands
seventeen feet wide fifty five feet deep forty two hundred square feet four floors with a rentable basement apartment so five altogether courtyard in back could you slow down a
looking back over her shoulder or we could wait for the car
feet are faster
how many more do we have after this
none theres nothing else you know how tight the market is
this is it
i told you on the phone i have to be moved in in two weeks
sarah please dont bounce that here
mom its the sidewalk
oh that miserable little prick is already leaving
they approach a row of brownstones narrow four story townhouses nice looking buildings a hundred years old or more
evan a sour looking man has just locked the front door of number and is coming down the steps
he sees them coming
one day you will learn to respect other peoples time lydia one day you evan i am so sorry you were a saint to wait for us
evan throws open the front door revealing the airy foyer of the townhouse
the place is completely empty
he talks fast races through the tour
the three of them come in sarah still bouncing her basketball
this is the middle of the house the entry floor living rooms over there
the kitchen floors below us and theres two bedroom floors above
the front door closes behind them with a thud so authoritative it seems to say no ones ever getting out
meg tries to get her daughters attention to tell her to stop bouncing the ball in the house
its an enormous amount of space for the money and ill be perfectly honest the family is in no hurry whatsoever
meg whispers sarahs name but sarah still ignores her goes on bouncing the ball
i dont have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property
no ball kid
sarah immediately stops bouncing
she wanders into the living room peers through the big french doors which look out over the courtyard area
theres another row of brownstones on the next block and all the patios back up to one another
it looks tranquil out there oasis in the city
sarah leans up against the door sighs her breath fogs the window
there is a profound melancholy about her
meg watches her tries to catch eyes with her in the reflection
evan flings open the door of an old fashioned cage style elevator
pearlstine the previous owner was disabled the last ten years of his life
highly unusual the elevator you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones
will they take asking price
i need a two week escrow and im already approved for the loan
lydia turns gives meg an are you insane
what say we see the house before we dicker hmm
starting up the stairs i have to warn you this is exactly the response we expected to get
its a very emotional property
as he disappears upstairs lydia turns to meg lowers her voice
who taught you to negotiate
its not like saks mom you dont have to pay the price on the tag
she gets in the elevator and rattles the door shut with a bang
that kids got an attitude
meg takes a deep breath turns to lydia
she brushes her hair behind an ear we notice her thin hand is shaking
this is more my husbands area
she digs in her purse for a prescription pill bottle and some water
im not very good at
lydia watches as she swallows a pill waiting for meg to finish her sentence
not very good at what
things and if i cant prove to my soon to be ex husband that i can provide a suitable place for our daughter to live in the next fourteen days
its going to get ugly between us
lydia just looks at her no idea what to say
these two are from different places
from upstairs it would be so lovely if i could shot the property before i leave
evan lydia and meg poke their heads in a series of rooms one after the other the tour flying by quickly
first an upstairs bedroom
nice roomy looks out on the courtyard
two bedrooms one bathroom
another floor another empty room
the trio passes through
third floor spare bedroom den what have you
pearlstine used it as an office
low voice to meg hes talking about bernard pearlstine
meg shrugs whos that
moving through a bathroom master bath
the hotel guy
its been in the papers lately
his kids are all suing each other over his estate
he was a total recluse paranoid rich as hell he was worth thirty million or something now it turns out they cant find half of it
singsong somebody took something didnt belong to them
i hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property
low to meg stop calling it the property you sound ridiculous
through a closet master closet
from the hallway there is a groaning metallic sound the elevator and the happy laughter of the little girl as she puts it through its paces
evan winces speaks as if his mouth hurts when he moves it
could the child please stop that
she looks at meg and winks
and we emerge in the master bedroom
he checks his watch
meg looks around studying the dimensions of the room
she looks at the far wall the one that borders the house next door
she looks at the wall that corners it opposite the window wall
she takes two steps back from it
i dont know doesnt that corner seem funny to you
she points to the far end of the wall near the entrance to the closet
there is a mirrored door that leads to the closet and a mirror on the wall alongside it
if you look closely youll see that the mirrors are raked slightly toward one another which causes an optical illusion in which the corner of the room appears much closer
to the door than it is
i was waiting to see if youd notice
on caravan no one from our office had the slightest idea
he pushes on the top of the mirror on the wall
it makes a faint click then glides open a few inches off the wall
he pulls it toward him opens it all the way a hundred eighty degrees and it fastens magnetically to the back of the closed door
there is smooth wall behind it but if you look closely there is a faint vertical crack in the wall
meg looks at him what in the world
even pushes again twice this time first at the top then at the bottom and the smooth wall clicks ajar
he pulls it wide open
meg and lydia step forward fascinated
from the opposite end of a lone narrow windowless space we see the three of them standing in the open doorway silhouetted by the sunlight streaming through the bedroom windows
its called a panic room
he hits a switch and a row of bulbs flick on overhead
a safe room
an inner sanctum
a castle keep in medieval times
oh ive seen these
its quite in vogue in high end construction right now
one really cant be too careful about home invasion
the other two walk inside but meg lingers near the door looking around studying the neatly arrayed survival supplies water food packs batteries flashlights tools rope clothes blankets you get
hey this is perfect for you
meg scoffs absolutely
youre a woman youre living alone now
your alarm goes off or you head glass break or for whatever reason you think someones broken into your home in the middle of the night
what are you going to do
call the police and wait until they get here on tuesday
traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out
i think not
reinforced steel core walls
buried phone line completely separate not connected to the houses main line and never exposed throughout the houses infrastructure or outside the house you can call the police nobody can
cut you off
your own ventilation system complete with oxygen scrubber so youve got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like
and a bank of video monitors he hits a switch next to a dozen tiny video monitors revealing a dozen different views of the house
covering almost every corner of the house
meg nods starting to sweat
makes me nervous
ever read any poe
i dont think so but i love her album
no edgar allen
thinks the furniture guy
giving up whats to keep them from prying open the door
evan reaches past meg and pushes a red button on the wall behind her
with a sudden whang of steel a heavy metal door leaps out of a slot in the wall and slams shut like a submarine hatch
a series of metal latches click into place inside it from top to bottom securing it into place
steel four inches thick
meg takes a step back
theyre now enclosed in the room
everythings spring loaded even if the powers out its fully functional
old bernie didnt miss a trick with this room did he
open the door
and with kids like hes got no wonder he wanted a place to hide
thats highly inappropriate
i said open the door
evan hits a green button and the door groans slowly open recoiling its massive spring and revealing sarah the little girl standing in the entryway grinning widely
definitely my room
she bolts in just as her mother bolts out
meg stands just outside the door to the panic room regaining her composure
not crazy about tight spaces
which we already knew
that door is a safely hazard
not at all
theres a tiny red beam that shines across the doorway one at shoulder height infrared
like the beam in an elevator doorway
wont let the door close if somethings blocking it
and one at shin height
even bend down blocks the one at shin height with his hand
he reaches up to push the close button but with one hand anchored at the floor he cant quite reach it
to lydia push that button for me will you
lydia pushes the close button nothing happens
evan pulls his hand put of the beam takes a step back
lydia pushes the button again
the metal door rockets shut the metallic slang reverberating in the room
almost immediately the fake piece of wall hums shut of its own accord followed a moment later by the mirror which detaches itself from the back of the closet door
and hums silently back into place closing over the hidden door making the corner of the room look like a corner again
as the mirrored door closes it shows meg her own reflection
she looks at herself still rattled
she wipes a trickle of sweat from the side of her face
the same house two weeks later
the entry floor is piled high with moving boxes
sarah and meg lie sprawled out in the middle of the black and white tile arms and legs splayed wide exhausted
they stare up at the ceiling beat
too many stairs
got us in here didnt i
shoulda got an apartment
well i know that now
meg raises her hand to her face shes got her cell phone in her palm
meg picks up the wall phone in the kitchen gets a dial tone
the phone works
to sarah hey i hooked up the phone
sarcastic the crowd goes wild
ignoring the slight
meg finishes dialing
it rings someone answers
perrys pizza please hold
night has fallen
meg and sarah sit at a small table in the middle of the kitchen surrounded by packing boxes
they eat pizza
they chew silently
sarah drinks a diet dr
meg finishes a glass of wine
megs eyes are moist
she notices her noticing shrugs
im human what do you want me to do hide it
sarah looks away goes back to chewing
after a moment fuck him
fuck her too
meg looks at her not sure how to confront the open defiance
sarah stares at her for a moment then goes back to eating
meg picks up the bottle of wine
sarahs eyes flick over and watch as wine glugs into her mothers glass
sarahs bedroom is full of unpacked boxes but her twin bed has been set up and sarah is in it hair wet pajamas on
she reads from a book tom swift and his repelatron skyway while meg drowsy lies next to her listening
toms throat felt so dry and tight that it was a moment before he could make any sound come out
im inside the machine
the elder scientist gasped
he dashed across the laboratory and switched off the repelatrons motor
what happened son
the durafoam hardened dad
get a solvent quick you know the formula
in the master bathroom meg soaks in a bath
she is exhausted
she reaches for her wine glass finishes the last of it
she stretches for the bottle which is on the floor next to her
she refills the glass
meg dressed in an old knicks t shirt and boxer shorts stands next to the alarm panel in the master bedroom reading from an instruction manual
she mutters slurring a bit drunk
bypass non ready zones
shunt enter zone number
she tries it pushing a few buttons but the alarm panel beeps at her disapprovingly
shes doing something wrong
she sighs sits on the floor gets serious about figuring out the instructions
bypass non ready zones
ah shunt enter shunt again zone number
dance over the alarm panel some time later
she seems to have figured it out and a small light on the panel lights up
the very moment the red light goes on we cut sharply to the darkened panic room where the dozen small video screens all suddenly wink to life showing a dozen
views of the house
whatever she pushed turned these on too probably not what she meant to do but at least she got the alarm on for the night
the door that leads from the panic room to the master bedroom hangs open
in the middle of the floor in here somebody has made a small tent of blankets and couch cushions
sarah must have been playing here before bed
meg puts sheets on her bed in the master bedroom
she fills a glass of water puts it on a box shes using for a night table
she plugs in a battery charger for her cell phone places the phone in the cradle
she sets the digital clock puts it next to the glass of water
she gets in bed her side the left side
she lies in the dark half an acre of empty bed across from her
we drift off her see the clock again
the time changes the number one dissolves away changing the time to
meg is in a hard boozy sleep
we drift out the door of the master bedroom into the third floor hallway and down the open stairwell
we glide through the entry floor still gently falling through the stairwells airway dropping even further all the way down to the kitchen floor the ground floor
we drift across the darkened kitchen serpentine through the canyon of moving boxes approach the window that looks out on the street
we move right up against the window peer through the glass just as a van pulls up across the street and stops
cant see through its windows
no movement for a moment then the drivers door opens and a man climbs out
he wears dark clothes
the man closes the door looks both ways and starts across the street towards us
hes carrying a bag of some kind
he goes to the door and we drift down toward the doorknob
we hear a key slide into the door rattle
but the lock doesnt turn
the key slides out back in again jiggles
still wont open the door
the man steps away from the door goes to the kitchen window which is heavily barred and peers inside right at us
cant see anything its darker in here than it is out there
he turns looks both ways on the street again then steps up onto the window ledge
now we can only see his legs cant tell what hes doing
hes reaching up stretching for something
it drops into view with a metallic scrape
the fire escape
the man climbs his feet disappearing from our field of vision
we turn around facing the other way in the kitchen
we start back the way we came through the canyon of boxes in the kitchen toward the stairwell
back in the stairwell the exact reverse of the shot we saw earlier
were drifting up off the kitchen floor through the entry floor and as we rise we notice something all the way up on the roof that we couldnt see before
when we were looking down
we continue to rise drawn toward it
we move up through the master bedroom floor creeping up alongside the stair banister now reaching the top floor of the house and just as we near the skylight a
figure appears visible through it
the man in dark clothes on the roof now
he stops peers down through the skylight looking at us without seeing us again
he steps across the skylight
this is not the way he intends to enter
we drift again following his soft footsteps on the roof which we can hear faintly through the ceiling
here in the hall just outside sarahs bedroom a closet door is ajar
we squeeze through the gap and into the closet
its completely dark
cant see a thing
but then a sliver of light appears coming from above
we look up
there is a ladder thats bolted to the wall in this closet it leads up to a square panel in the ceiling
and that roof access panel is moving ever so slightly moonlight spilling in as it twists in its setting
a shiny silver something slides through the crack along the edges of the portal
it slithers along the edge of the hatchway searching for something
it finds a small round nub in the crack
the silver something stops
it hums with electricity for a moment then there is a bright spark and a soft crack
in the master bedroom a message appears on the alarm panel in the closet the silver something withdraws and the roof access panel is removed
a million stars are visible in the night sky above
but were inside
and in a moment so is this intruder
the man peers down through the open hatchway then slips through the opening and climbs silently down the ladder
in bed meg stirs
an alcohol sleep is a restless one and shes suffering
she sits up groggily chugs a glass of water
lies down again
one floor up the man steps into the hallway and starts for the stairs moving quickly and confidently
knows where hes going knows what he wants
he starts down the stairs happens to glance to the side as he does so
hes looking in the open doorway of the top floor bathroom staring hard at something that clearly disturbs him
plugged into an outlet in the baseboard in the bathroom
for the record its the power puff girls
the man climbs the stairs again concerned goes to the door of the bathroom
he looks from the nightlight to the countertop
theres a moving box on the countertop
his eyes widen
this is news to him bad news
he takes a step back and a breath
he turns looks to the end of the hall
his eyes now adjusted to the darkness he notices something he didnt see before something coming from under the door to the fourth floor bedroom
from another nightlight
in the top floor bedroom a nightlight burns in another outlet
nearby sarah is asleep in bed the covers kicked off
the door to sarahs bedroom glides open terribly slowly
the man stands in the doorway staring aghast at the mountain of moving boxes piled in the room
his gaze falls on sarah in the bed
the man just stares beside himself
his lips mouth a word soundlessly
doesnt take a lip reader to guess it
in the master bedroom meg flops over in bed facing away from the doorway really having a rough go of it
she slept too hard before now shes awake her head is killing her shes really paying the price of four glasses of wine
she lies still on her side facing us
behind her the bedroom door moves silently
the man stands there one finger still on the door hes just pushed open
he stares at the sleeping form of meg on the bed whose back is to him
he has no idea shes awake
meg lies in bed eyes wide open no idea a man is standing in the doorway to her bedroom
noiselessly the man moves away down the hall
the moment his head disappears down the stairwell meg flops over again facing the doorway
she closes her eyes gives sleep another try
the man walks across the kitchen shaking his head in exasperation at the packing boxes all around him
he goes to the front window peers outside
he reaches for a light switch on his right
through the window we can see the stoop light go on
then off then on and off again
still through the window we see the side panel door of the van slide open
two more men climb out
they are also dressed in dark clothes
they also carry satchels
they walks calmly across the street grow large in the window as they approach us
the first intruder who has a name its burnham steps over to the kitchen door runs his silvery strip through the gap
another hum and spark
burnham opens the kitchen door letting the two other guys slip inside
raoul is a hulking figure whose back seems to rise up over the top of his slouching head when he walks it looks like gravity does all the work just
pulling him forward
junior is much smaller very high strung dresses like a homey very street but cant hide the fact that the street is park avenue
they all freeze staring at the moving boxes
a woman and a little girl both asleep upstairs
keep your voice down
theyre not supposed to be here
this was your department junior
theyre not supposed to be here
thats why the key didnt work they changed the locks
fourteen day escrow man thats almost three weeks
they shouldnt be here for another week

pause exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks

raoul steps forward shoves burnham with both hands in the chest
watch your mouth
its okay raoul
to junior who is this guy
raoul is cool
thats all you need to know
this is insane
im outta here
he starts for the door
wait a minute wait a minute
we can still handle this
to raoul can we still handle this
its just the woman and the kid
unless daddy comes back later
daddys not coming back shes in the middle of a divorce its just the two of them

raoul can totally administrate that part
i dont want raoul to administrate that part
they wont get hurt
what about us

raoul what in gods name do we do if she has a gun
raoul pulls up his sweatshirt revealing a
tucked into his belt
a guy shows you a gun burnham and you insult him
hey whos the idiot
where did you get this clown
i met him at the tables same as you
and frankly im grateful we have a little muscle right about now
ive never seen him before
to raoul the fuck did you bring a gun for
he moves for the door
junior trying desperately to hold this together gets there first blocks the door with his back
we cant do it without you burnham
junior starts at burnham
raoul stares at burnham
its still a good plan

burnham hesitates fourteen million dollars upstairs burnham
youll be out of the hole
baby youll be so far out of the hole you could draw bricks every night for the next twenty years and still shit green
burnham sways come on buddy
one more hand
meg sits up in bed
shes bleary her head feels like someone rested a manhole cover on it
she gets up in the dark and staggers off toward the bathroom door feeling her way with her arms her eyes not adjusted to the dark
she steps through the door
she walks into the bathroom and feels around for a light switch but cant find it
she blinks squints tries to get her bearings
the only light is a harsh white glow that comes from along one wall from a bank of tiny video monitors
she finds the light switch flicks it on it nearly blinds her
shes not in the bathroom
shes wandered into the panic room by mistake
she turns around walks out leaving the lights on behind her
we linger for a look at the video screens
if only shed done the same shed see what we see
we see the three men still in the kitchen huddled in a group silently debating what to do
using the light that spills from the open door to the panic room meg comes back into the master bedroom and finds the proper door to the bathroom
meg snaps the cap off a jug of advil and dumps three into her palm
she pops them in her mouth searches for a glass for water finds none bends to the spout for a gulp to wash them down
she turns to the toilet
on the monitor we see the three men leave the kitchen and start up the stairs
meg stands flushes the toilet
one floor down burnham raoul and junior freeze just coming up the stairs from the kitchen
they look up hearing the water rushing through the pipes in the ceiling directly above them
they stare at the ceiling following with their eyes as a pair of feet pad across the creaky floor
finally they hear a squeak of bedsprings as meg climbs back into bed
they hold a moment longer a silence grows
raoul reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a ski mask
he pulls it over his head
they look at him
whispers no face
burnham rolls his eyes
doesnt know this guy much but hates him so far
they start across the foyer toward the stairs
meg rolls over to go back to sleep
she sees shes left the lights on in the panic room
she tsks gets out of bed and walks across the floor toward it
meg steps into the panic room raises her hand to the light switch and stops her hand frozen in mid air
she cocks her head looking at something she cant understand
takes a step further into the room
she stares at the video monitors at the three men in dark clothes stealing silently across the foyer
this cant be
these are just pictures they have no relation to reality
she drops to her knees her face inches from the screens and reaches out to touch them as if trying to make sure theyre really there
they reach the base of the stairs junior in the lead
as he reaches a bend at the base of the stairs he places one foot short on an angled step and it slips off
he trips falls forward
watching the video monitors meg stares in horror as the image of junior slipping is verified by the slap of his hands on the stairs as he catches himself audible
through the open door to the panic room
it is real
in the living room burnhams eyes are wide as saucers staring at junior as he turns and pulls himself to his feet
junior points at raoul speaks in an urgent whisper
top floor get the little girl and keep her there
ill bring the woman up
he holds out his hand for the gun and raoul gives it to him
points to burnham stay here
nobody gets past you
he heads for the stairs
raoul follows close behind him
burnham stays reluctant what the fuck has he gotten himself into
leaps to her feet and dashes out of the room
meg races across her bedroom flies out the door and bolts up the carpeted stairs headed for the top floor
meg races into sarahs room drops onto the bed and grabs sarah by the shoulders trying to rouse her
but shes in a profound childs sleep and wont wake up
one floor down junior and raoul reach the third floor landing
still moving stealthily junior heads down the hall for the master bedroom where he thinks meg is sleeping
raoul heads for the stairs that lead to the top floor
meg is desperate still cant wake sarah
come on come on
she sees a plastic cup on her night table box half filled with water
she snatches it and tosses the water in her face
now shes awake
and pissed off
she sputters shouts
raoul at the base of the stairs that lead to the top floor hears the kid shouting
he starts up the stairs quickly
on the top floor meg is already dragging sarah out of the room and into the hallway
meg and sarah come out of sarahs bedroom just as raoul reaches the top of the stairs at the other end
theyre cut off
meg freezes staring at the hulking ski masked figure at the end of the hallway
she thinks no idea what to do for a second
she looks frantically to her right the bathroom dead end
she looks to her left
she yanks open the elevator door throws aside the gate and races inside with sarah
raoul takes off down the hall lunging for the elevator
meg slams the gate shut and punches the button for the first floor
the elevator groans to life and starts down slowly
sarah looks up at her terrified
whats going on
in the house
as the elevator descends they see raoul through the window in the door as he drops to his knees to get a good look at them
raoul turns from the elevator shouts to the open stairwell
junior turns from the open doorway of the master bedroom and races back down the hall toward the elevator
he reaches the door peers through the window
he sees the bare feet of meg and sarah dropping toward him
he grabs the door handle pulls as hard as he can but it stays locked with the elevator moving beyond
he bangs on the button hoping the elevator will stop
as meg and sarah drop fully into view he stands there eye to moving eye with her for a moment
but the elevator doesnt stop it keeps going down
meg stands frozen terrified staring at junior as they move past him
junior has another go at the door pulling as hard as he can actually bending the door but the elevator is still moving the catch holds fast and the door
as they pass his face suddenly disappears he takes off
junior flies down the stairs to cut them off at the first floor
hes going down
meg thinks then punches the button for three to go back up
but the elevator continues down
she jabs at it futilely
she reaches past her pushes the stop button
the elevator jerks to a halt
then sarah pushes three
now the elevator starts to rise
meg looks at her impressed
love that kid
in the foyer junior freezes hearing the elevator stop and start again
he takes off up the stairs again
burnham cant take it anymore he takes off after junior following him upstairs
raoul still on the top floor heads for the stairs fast
junior races back up the stairs
they have her caught in the middle
the door to the elevator bangs open on three the gate rattles aside and meg and sarah leap out
they take off down the hall toward the doorway to the master bedroom
raoul flies down the stairs not twenty feet behind them
meg and sarah run through the master bedroom
as she passes the night table sarah swings an open hand to grab her cell phone from its cradle
but in her haste she starts to pull it out at an angle and the prongs at the bottom stick in the charger
the phone slips from her fingers bounces off the corner of the table caroms off her foot and skitters under the bed
sarah turns looks to the head of the stairs just as junior turns the corner and raoul thunders down the steps from four
she abandons the phone grabs sarah and they lunge through the open doorway to the panic room
junior and raoul burst through the doorway to the bedroom just a few steps away
meg and sarah trip over each other coming through the doorway they tumble to the floor of the panic room the door wide open behind them
meg spins around hurls herself at the red button on the wall junior leaps sailing through the air toward them meg slams her open palm on the red button the
massive coiled spring that holds the metal door open is released the steel barrier leaps forward out of the wall and whangs shut in a split second
junior slams into the closing metal door banging his shoulder into it and slithers to the ground too late
meg rolls over and pulls sarah into her arms both of them breathing hard asking each other if theyre okay scared out of their minds
she spots the telephone the one with the special buried phone line
she lunges for it snatches it from its cradle listens for a dial tone
nothing there either
it doesnt work
different phone line i never hooked it up
she hurls it down looks back at sarah
she seems a bit pale scared
she goes to her holds her reassures her
junior is slumped at the base of the door livid in pain pounding on it with his fists screaming no
over and over again crazy with rage
raoul stands in the middle of the room chest heaving hands on his knees
burnham finally walks into the room and stops in the doorway looks from raoul to junior to the door to the panic room figures out the situation
tell me theyre not in there
we rise up above them above the room looking down on them the rats in a maze shot
we rise up further still above where the ceiling ought to be to look down on this room and the one beside it the room behind the four inches of
reinforced steel the panic room in which meg and sarah kneel in the middle of the floor holding each other tight
very close on the metal door from inside the panic room
an ear moves slowly into frame presses against the cold steel
meg pulls away from the door shaking her head
cant hear a thing
what do they want
i dont know
i dont know
she sits back against a wall looks around at the tiny room
shes trying not to show how freaked out she is
what do we do
what if they get in here
they cant get in here
i heard you
she checks her wristwatch for some reason
dont worry about me
the implications being worry about yourself
sarah crawls over to the bank of video monitors studies them
meg crawls over to join her
they scan the screens
there are a dozen different views of the house
top floor bedrooms both of them
top two floor hallways
even one with a shot of the inside of the elevator
the three intruders are gathered in the living room standing in a tight circle having a hell of an argument
lots of gesturing fingers jabbing in chests but we cant hear a word
meg furrows her brow noticing something interesting to the right of the video monitors
she slides over studies a panel there with sixteen different buttons and a small grilled area
sarah joins her looks at the buttons
each one is labeled with a different room name den kitchen master bedroom etc
up in the corner there is a button that says all page down in the opposite corner theres a button marked meg looks at sarah
meg is reluctant frightened
sarah is encouraging for the first time
you can do it
meg leans forward clears her throat
burnham raoul and junior are standing in the half darkened living room in the middle of their argument when a voice booms around them
they practically jump out of their shoes looking around for the source of the voice
the police are on their way
only burnham has remained relatively calm
after he gets over the initial shock he walks toward the tiny camera thats hidden in an upper corner of the living room wall and stares up at it
raoul who has taken off his ski mask is careful to move out of the cameras range and turn his back to it
i suggest you leave
burnham looks up at the camera and shakes his head wagging a finger from side to side
he raises a hand makes a gesture like a telephone then wags his finger again
the message is clear you dont have a phone
meg is puzzled
howd he know that
she presses the talk button again
into speaker take what you want and get out
that sounded fairly tough
she looks at the monitor again
the three of them have an urgent whispered conference then they all start patting their pockets for some reason turning in circles looking for something
meg and sarah watch them confused
burnham holds up a finger to the camera wait a second while raoul and junior rush off screen looking for something
junior returns a moment later holding something and the three of them hunch over a box working on something
after a moment they break apart and junior steps up to the camera holding a pad of paper
he shows it to the camera
on the top page in big block letters theyve written
after a suitable pause for reading he turns to the second page where four more words are written
sarah gasps meg sits back
what we want is in that room
theyre coming in here arent they
no i told you they cant
its not a possibility
angry she sits forward and jabs the talk button
into speaker what do you know about this room
there is more frenzied writing more arguing and a first draft of a response torn up
finally junior steps forward with another sign megs confidence is ebbing but she doesnt want to show it
she hits the talk button again
into speaker were not coming out
were not letting you in
get out of my house
clicks off say fuck
into speaker fuck
get the fuck out of my house
into speaker get the fuck out of my house
she clicks off again looks to sarah for approval and gets it sort of in sarahs half smile
but sarahs eyes go back to the screen
meg follows sarahs eyes back to the screen where another message is being held up for them
the notepad says meg and sarah speak at the same time
give me a break
in the living room her voice booms from the speaker
with an audible click she signs off
burnham raoul and junior stand arrayed beneath the camera staring up at it dumbfounded
got her right where you want her junior
when you said youd let em go i thought shed come running right out for sure
shut up and let me think
he opens a pack of cigarettes takes out a joint and lights it
im afraid to let you think junior
things get worse when you think
sniffs oh thats gonna help
holding in a hit okay fuckball you think
what are we gonna do
what if she called the cops
she said she did
cops woulda been here by now if she called em
besides junior cut the phones
burnham goes to the window and stares outside
he laughs covers his face
what the fuck is funny about this
there is not one thing funny here
who else but god could think this shit up
i spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out now i gotta figure out how to get in
god man he just loves the irony
yes its all terrible ironic and amusing
now how are you gonna get us into that room
cant get in the room
so what the fuck are we supposed to do
make her come out
and when she does thats when we gotta be careful
she cant get out of this house
she cant even think she can get out of this house
we just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty five minutes
and i dont want raoul joe pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger
thats a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in greenhaven
so were gonna seal the place up
they wanna hole up in here
fine well help em
make it impossible for them to leave
once they come out of that room
and why exactly would they want to come out
at the window burnham notices something sitting just outside the french doors on the balcony
its a large outdoor barbecue grill
he thinks takes a step closer
he sees a white five gallon tank of some kind underneath the grill
workin on it
in the panic room meg is sitting cross legged on the floor leaning against a wall but sarah is in motion sorting through shelves opening drawers
every drawer has something in it sealed under plastic
she opens and closes sorts and lifts finds the following waterproof matches and lighters
unopened packages of batteries
sealed water bags stamped pure five years from date
pillows fireproof blankets we know because the bags are stamped fireproof blanket
a complete tool kit
as sarah explores she discovers something in the far wall at the end of the room down on the floor at eye level
its a small round portal about eight inches across with a four pronged cloverlike seal
the portal is closed tight as sarah pokes and scrapes at it idly with a finger or two it resists her attempts to crank it open
but sarah keeps at it feels along the edges of the portal then all along the wall looking for some kind of hidden switch that controls it
i mean it lie down
you get your adrenaline up and you know whats gonna happen
sarah stops looks at her mother who is pale and wan huddled in the corner
are you freaking out
sarah looks around the room
nods fast dont though
talk about it that is sarah looks at her thinks
its not an unfamiliar situation her needing to comfort her mother
why did the chicken cross the road
what am i a five year old
why did the chicken cross the road
i dont know why
to prove he wasnt chicken
meg tries to push a smile across her face but its immediately dashes as she looks back at the video screens
her eyes show alarm staring at the kitchen
what the hell are they doing
the contents of one of the satchels is dumped out over the kitchen counter every kind of tool imaginable many that are unfamiliar to us
they sort through the pile choosing things
at the french doors that lead to the garden burnham has a cordless screwdriver and a pile of long screws in his hand
he reaches up drills a screw through the door into the corner of the door frame
he does the same at the bottom of the door
he unlocks the doorknob tries it
the screws hold the door fast
he moves on to the next door
in the panic room meg stares at the video screens eyes wide terrified
she watches them
cant take her eyes off them
barely audible locking us in
in the library in the front of the house raoul screws shut a window driving the long screws into its frame
he looks out at the street at two clubgoers walking home
he pulls the drape
megs hands are over her mouth shes trembling shaking her head from side to side
this cant be happening
in the kitchen junior goes to the wall phone meg used to call for pizza earlier
he cuts the phone wire with a knife
he stands there staring at the phone wiping the sweat from his palms on his pants
not satisfied he pulls the phone itself out of the wall cuts the cord for the handset too
meg pushes herself back into the corner of the panic room horrified
sweat has broken out on her forehead her whole body seems to vibrate
sarah comes over leans in front of her
but sarahs voice is hollow seems far away
are you okay
meg looks at her
as she watches sarah floats away from her
in fact the entire room is floating away from her elongating
meg looks to the sides and the walls dont just seem like theyre pushing in on her they are pushing in on her
meg opens her mouth screams but no sound comes out
sarah stands up and bends over her but now shes just a figure far away all the way at the end of a long impossibly narrow hall
barely heard meg crawls out into the middle of that hallway to get away from the wall but they both continue moving in on her
her eyes roll back into her head we see just the whites and she loses her balance falling over onto her back
we fall with her move in tight on her face and the dark hallway carpet beneath it turns to green all green grassy green
she sits up looks around and we realize she is in fact somewhere else shes in the middle of the great lawn in central park
she stands turns in a circle shes completely alone on the great green grassy plain in the middle of a beautiful spring day tall buildings sparkling in the distance
meg stretches her arms out smiles but far off in the distance she hears a voice calling to her dimly mom
meg ignores the voice shes so happy to be out here out in the open in the beautiful wide open she could stay here forever she spins around throws her
head back but theres that voice again insistent mom please
there is the sharp sound of a slap and megs face abruptly jerks to the side
she touches her cheek confused as a hot red handprint rises up on it
what the hell was that
now the perfect spring day is shattered suddenly by a deafening crunch
the smile vanishes from megs face she turns
where did that come from
another one even louder
megs whole body winces at the sound
a third one and on this one meg falls to her knees covering her ears walls spring up around her right there on the great lawn we rush in on
her the walls close in and shes right back in the panic room where she always was and that pounding is real its right outside the door its like somebodys trying to smash their way right through the wall
sarah is right over meg holding her by the arms and that handprint on megs face is real sarah must have slapped her to try to bring her out of
meg looks to the wall watches it seem to vibrate as another deafening bang crunches into it from outside
the sound is deafening
sarah throws both hands over her ears
meg looks around still disoriented
they huddle there terrified
meg blinks wipes the sweat from her forehead begins to come back around
she turns her head sneaks a look at the funny wristwatch sarah wears tries to look without her daughter knowing
its not an ordinary watch it only has one number a tall flashing digital display meg nods as if reassuring herself
she turns looks at the video monitors to see what the hell theyre doing out there
in the master bedroom a claw hammer crunches into the sheetrock on the outer wall of the panic room
the intruders are in the master bedroom now and burnham is like a man possessed tearing at the sheetrock with the sharp end of the tool while junior shines a
flashlight into the hole
as the sheetrock tears away we see the skeleton of the wall behind it
theres a latticework of two by four studs and beyond those the dull shine of the walls metal core
but thats not what hes after
he continues tearing reveals an air duct running through the wall feeding into the panic room through a welded hole in the steel
burnham tears away with the hammer exposing a short section of the duct
the claw hammer drops into an opened toolbox
burnham drops to his knees rips open another tool case
this one has a sophisticated looking power drill in it along with a couple dozen specialized bits
he selects one twists it into the drill
at the wall burnham puts drill to metal and hits the switch
a horrendous metal screech fills the air and the drill bit tears into the duct opening up a jagged hole about the size of a quarter
raoul hurries through the doorway of the bedroom carrying a coiled garden hose
burnham snaps his fingers for it raoul tosses it to him holding one end and the hose uncoils in the air as it snakes across the room
burnham shoves the end of the garden hose into the hole hes just drilled in the air duct
he tears off a length of duct tape and seals the connection makes it airtight
using a large hunting knife raoul hacks a ten foot section of the garden hose off the coil
he stretches it out across the room to the white five gallon tank we saw before which is now sitting on the floor up here
we move in close as burnham snugs the cut end of the garden hose over a spigot at the top of the tank
red block letters are easy to read on the side of the tank
along with a number of other dire warnings
burnham raises his hand to the knob hesitates doesnt really want to do this but doesnt stop himself either
he spins it open
he said open it
just sending a message
shell get the point
gas hisses through the spigot and into the hose
we follow along the length of the hose across the floor of the room through the hole in the sheetrock into the hole thats been drilled in the air duct
through the wall itself where we see the horizontal lines of an air vent up ahead
we squeeze between two of the horizontal lines and come out in the panic room
three red streamers tied to the air vent flap to life as the gas hisses into the panic room
directly underneath the vent meg is hunched up against the wall her arm around sarah
they look at each other
she looks up
sees the streamers floating above her
she leaps to her feet steps up onto a shelf and stretches her nose toward the streamers
just as she does near the tank raoul shoves burnham out of the way
we aint playin here
he cranks the valve handle of the grill open all the way
the gas pours into the hose with an audible whoosh
meg at the vent falls back two lungfuls of propane and drops to her knees on the floor
what what what is it
on the floor
get on the floor
now sarah coughs
the gas is pouring into the room
raoul is standing guard over the tank to make sure no one messes with the valve
look dont be stupid
junior has his head pressed against the door to the panic room trying to hear any sounds from within
were trying to scare them not kill them
theyre gonna die in there
nobody is gonna die man will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea
think about it what would you do if you were them stay in there and choke to death or come out
were just getting them to come out for forty five minutes forty five fucking minutes
the worst thats gonna happen is they pass out we drag em out here into the fresh air and theyll be fine
junior you gigantic idiot how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out
junior turns to raoul
cut it back a little bit
no fucking way
hes right we cant get into the room if theyre dead
meg and sarah are down on the floor rags covering their mouths trying like crazy to filter the air but its not working
sarah is crawling around the base of the wall near to where she was before clawing at the strange portal thing again
finally she finds a small metal handle folded back into the clover leaf seal on the portal
she unfolds it twists it
the portal cranks open revealing it to be at the end of a tube about a foot long an emergency ventilation source directly through to the exterior of the house
she bends down and looks through it
its covered by a metal mesh at the opposite end but she can see and smell the outside through it
she sits up gestures to her mother to bend down next to her
she does and they both jam their mouths up near the end of the tube gulping fresh air greedily
meg looks at sarah good job and they both drop to the floor at the portal and suck air
its temporary but it works
in the master bedroom the debate has turned physical
burnham lunges across the room at raoul to get his hands on the valve to turn off the gas
but raoul catches him and hurls him aside
burnham slams into the wall bounces off and screams at raoul who screams right back
junior leaps into the middle trying to break it up to get them to shut up keep their voices down
in the panic room meg knows this cant go on forever
she turns away from the portal looks up at the vent where the streamers still stream
she looks to the other side of the room to where sarah found the waterproof matches and lighters
takes a deep lungful of fresh air from the tube and crawls over to the lighters
she selects one snatches up a screwdriver
sarah looks at her has a vague idea of what shes thinking but cant believe it
she shakes her head vehemently
in response meg picks up two or three of the fireproof blankets and piles them over sarah right up to her disbelieving eyes
she bends down takes another gulp of air
but shes getting woozy
this cant go on much longer
she staggers across the room hoists herself back up onto the shelf she stood on before and gets right up next to the vent
holding her breath to avoid breathing the toxic gas she unscrews the vent cover
the duct is wide enough to put your arm in
she reaches in past a bundle of multicolored wires that run down through the wall
she reaches all the way in lighter in hand
we see her hand crawl in lighter clenched between her fingers
she raises a thumb to the flint wheel cranks it once
not even a spark
her hand shakes
she tries again
still no spark
but with the effort and the angle when she thumbs the lighter it makes her hand twitch banging up against the sides of the duct with a hollow boom
burnham turns abruptly
he turns around
they all freeze listening
he hears it again
the hollow boom coming from inside the wall
now a third time
he walks forward slowly toward the wall
he moves closer gets right up next to the wall
he leans into the wall putting his ear right up next to the air duct
this close he hears the sound in more detail realizes its two sounds
he arches an eyebrow
megs hand is trembling tiring
she tries again thumbs the flint wheel
it scratches as it rolls her hand twitches booms against the side of the duct
still the gas hisses through
megs face is turning color shes running out of air
her feet tremble on the shelf shes about to lose her footing
she tries again
burnhams eyes suddenly pop wide as he identifies the sound
he tears himself away from the wall megs thumb tenses for one good hard turn burnham leaps through the air hurling himself toward the propane tank meg cranks the wheel
a spark sparks a flame flames and a hot blue cloud shoots out in two directions one toward the panic room the other toward the bedroom
meg jumps off the shelf throwing herself as far away from the vent as she can her arm engulfed by licking blue flame
she drops to the floor of the room covering her daughters body just as the entire ceiling of the panic room turns into a lake of fire with a deafening
the fluorescent light tubes explode showering glass everywhere
the blue flame shoots out of the wall into the hose through the hose backing up toward the tank
burnham crunches to the floor next to the tank knocking the other end of the hose away from the spigot just as the blue flame erupts from the end of
the flame engulfs his entire body his hair starts on fire his chest his arms
raoul lunges forward junior tears the blankets from the bed and throws them over him burnham howls and rolls on the floor in pain
the blue cloud on the ceiling suddenly evaporates with another angry whoomp leaving a few little pockets of flame that meg extinguishes by swatting with a blanket
only one of the fluorescent lights is left intact it casts a flickering uneven light on the room
she stands in the middle of the still smoky panic room breathing hard
she shouts screams incomprehensibly making no sense whatsoever
she stops noticing the look sarah is giving her
wide eyed admiring frightened you are an insane woman
meg looks to herself
her arm is signed the hair burned off
the sleeve of her t shirt is burned back to the shoulder
her face is sooty blackened
meg grunts half frightened by herself
out in the bedroom its worse for burnham who has lost most of his hair and shirt
but his skin isnt badly burned which is something i guess
still hes in a rage
he pounds the metal door of the panic room
meg whirls goes to the door herself screams right back
we can hardly make out a word shes saying but it sounds threatening
suddenly she stops hearing something else
outside the door burnham continues to rant but theres a second sound a sound coming from the long wall of the panic room the wall thats shared with the brownstone
its a faint very faint pounding sound along with a high pitched complaining voice so faint it can hardly be heard
sarah hears it too
meg and sarah leap as one facing the common wall shouting at the tops of their lungs get help call the police please call the police that sort of thing
they shout and shout but the soft pounding continues and if their voices are as soft on the other side as the complaining voice is on this side they have
their voices crack and they begin to cough too irritated by the gas to shout for very long
long after they stop the soft pounding from next door continues
their pleas are not heard
the intruders have stopped their racket too and are listening carefully at the common wall
eventually the soft pounding stops the complaining voice complains no more
burnham stands there in pain
things are falling apart
raoul stands in the doorway silhouetted by the hallway light
he draws himself up to his full bulky height
to junior were gonna talk
junior nods and starts out
raoul lets him pass but when burnham tries to follow him raoul puts a big hand on his chest stopping him
make sure she dont come out
raoul turns follows junior downstairs
as he descends he looks up making eye contact with burnham
and holding it
something on his mind thats for sure
megs head falls back against a wall she sags to the floor legs folded in front of her completely drained
but sarahs not drained sarahs full of nervous ingenuity rustling around through the stuff in the panic room an idea forming in her head
she finds a powerful looking flashlight and loads it up with batteries
she tries it flashing around the room
halogen bulb very powerful hurts her mothers eyes as she flashes it past
meg watches her
whats she up to
sarah lays on the floor in front of the ventilation tube she discovered earlier
she squints through it
she can see out of the house into the courtyard behind the brownstone
about thirty yards away she can see the backs of the brownstones on the next block and directly across because the tube doesnt leave much room for lateral vision she
can see straight into somebodys bedroom
theres a light on
a sleeping man is in bed an open book on his chest
sarah sits back
she grabs the flashlight looks for a little button on the top the kind you can flick the flashlight on and off with
shining it on the wall of the panic room she flashes it at a wall three times on and off
satisfied she turns back to the tube
meg curious crawls across the floor to join her
sarah shoves the flashlight all the way into the tube leaving enough room on either side of it for them to see through
meg lays down flat squints into the tube sarah alongside her
she looks at her daughter curious your plan
sarah reaches into the tube finds the little flash button on the top of the flashlight
the piercing halogen beam begins to flash across the courtyard and into the bedroom of the man in the bedroom
the light flashes on the wall over his bed
the flashes are in a rhythm
meg turns to sarah impressed
nods dot dot dot dash dash dash dot dot dot
whered you learn s
the flashes continue dot dot dot dash dash dash dot dot dot
but the man continues to sleep the light on the wall behind him has no effect
sarah is frustrated
she adjusts the flashlight
the beam of light lowers jerkily from the wall until it is shining directly into the sleeping mans eyes
sarah strains to keep the light in that perfect spot
shes starting to sweat
meg leans over sneaks a peek at the watch sarah wears on her left wrist
the readout the sleeping man stirs
opens his eyes
winces from the light which is flashing directly in his eyes
come on come on
the sleeping man sits up
raises a hand trying to block the light which keeps flashing on him
he gets up out of bed
he comes to the window
yes yes yes yes
sarah keeps it up flashing faster
they see the man come all the way to his window
he leans against it cups his hands so he can see better
the flashes continue right on top of him now
clearly the man is reading the flashes
he takes a steps back from the window gives them the finger and angrily yanks shut his drapes
a moment later the light goes out and the room is black
meg and sarah drop their heads to the carpet defeated
sarah rolls over knocks the flashlight away stares up at the ceiling
meg puts a hand in her hair
it was a good idea
were never getting out of here
she looks at the wristwatch again
burnham is concerned as well
hes still in the master bedroom but barely hes standing in the doorway straining like hell to hear a conversation that junior and raoul are having in the foyer one
theyre trying to keep their voices down but stray words float up through the open stairwell words like him and warning and dangerous
burnham chews a fingernail
if only he could get closer
he throws a look back at the door to the panic room
he looks back out the bedroom door
junior and raoul are huddled together in the foyer
theyre keeping their voices low but their conversation is heated
were not gonna do anything about him hes fine
if you think im gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of half
what did you take a nap in math class
three people three shares one third
four point six six six repeating
im just saying the man is a problem
and hes your problem
wasnt me idea to bring him along
thats right raoul it wasnt your idea none of this was your idea it was mine its my family were ripping off its my prick grandfather who built that fucking
room it was my idea to get the plans i found the floor safe and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one
me me me i i i at no point did i say you or raoul got it
he puts his hands on me again ill bury a slug in his ear
no you will not because without burnham theres no way in hell were gonna get into that safe so as far as im concerned he can paint your ass blue
and run it up a flagpole and you wont lay a finger on him you understand me
dont take no tone of voice with me homes
what is this shit youre talking all of a sudden
youre a bus driver homes you live in flatbush so please dont start spouting some elmore leonard shit you just heard because i saw that movie too junior and raoul
are visible still arguing in the foyer
on the next monitor over burnham is visible standing in the master bedroom doorway listening
meg is watching the monitors thinking
she notices something sits forward abruptly looking at the monitor that covers the master bedroom
she squeezes right up close staring at the screen
we peer closely at the box next to her bed the one she was using for a night table
on top of the box she sees the charger for her cellular phone sitting empty
meg sits back eyes alive with an idea
if only she could get to that phone which must be still under the bed
she looks back at the monitors at burnham lingering in the doorway to the room
she turns away from the monitors to check on sarah whos settled into a corner of the room looking pale
in the bedroom burnham is desperate
the argument downstairs is entering round two and hes got to hear what theyre saying
he takes a few steps out of the bedroom and comes into the hallway
he leans over the stairwell
where hes standing he is directly under the camera that covers the hallway and cant be seen on the monitor that covers the hallway
meg turns back from sarah to look at the monitors again
she see burnham is no longer in the bedroom
and doesnt appear to be in the hallway either
oh yes yes
she looks at another monitor
she sees junior and raoul in the foyer
meg sits back
that leaves burnham unaccounted for
the hell is he
burnham is still lingering under the camera
sarah has come forward to the monitors as well
yeah but wheres the third guy
not in the bedroom
meg goes to the door raises a hand to the green open button
we see burnham lurking in the hallway just about six feet from the door to the panic room
dont open that door
meg wipes sweat from her palm
if it looks like i cant get back just close the door
sarah nods looks back to the button
a shouted curse rises up from downstairs
burnham takes a step toward the stairs
he suddenly appears in the hallway
sarah sees it
she looks at the monitor wide eyed
burnham cant take it anymore
he turns and takes off down the stairs
burnham flies down the stairs and appears in the foyer next to junior and raoul
meg and sarah see all three men accounted for downstairs
meg leaps up runs to the door and punches the green button
the door begins to crank open meg slips through the gap sideways before its even all the way open
she darts across the room slides to the floor next to the bed and flattens herself reaching underneath it to get the phone
damn that phone slid far its right in the middle wouldnt you know it
the three men hear her footsteps as one they take off for the stairs
meg continues to stretch her fingers inches from the phone
feet race up toward her megs fingernails paw the phone pull it closer to her
she grabs it stands the three men come off the stairs and race toward her they see her as she lunges across toward the panic room she hurls herself through
the door and sarah smacks the red button
the steel door closes with a deafening whang
the echo of the metallic whang reverberates through the house
in the panic room meg punches on her cell phone with trembling fingers
the big empty charger cradle is in the foreground when the three men burst into the room
burnham stops in the middle of the floor turns in a frantic circle
whatd she get whatd she get whatd she get
his eyes fall on the empty charger
meg raises the cell phone to her ear and gets a rapid busy signal
no no no no no no no
she looks at the phone
its showing just one signal bar and even that one is flashing on and off
oh come on come on come on
she walks around the room raises the phone high and low trying crazily to find a signal
in the bedroom burnham stands just outside the door fingertips lightly resting on it the ghost of a smile on his face
softly i dont think well be talking on our cell phone from in there
inside the room meg doesnt seem upset
rather shes staring at the cell phone in her hand thinking
at the same moment burnham is having the same thought
hes still at the door fingertips still resting there
burnham looks down at the baseboard below
what is he looking at
meg steps up onto the shelf she climbed earlier and comes up next to the vent
what are you doing
i saw something i saw
in the vent alongside the duct she sees the bundle of multicolored wires she saw earlier
she jumps down off the shelf goes to the tools starts searching for something
i may not have hooked up the phone in here but i hooked up the main line and theres a jack at the base of this wall outside i saw
yes that is correct there is in fact a jack in the base of the wall outside the door to the panic room
burnham bends down into frame studying it thinking the same thing she is
he clears his throat
say while were on the subject of phones
he turns looks up at junior
when i said cut the line did you cut the main line at the junction box in the basement like i said and which i repeated or did you just
cut the cord on the phone in the kitchen
i uh i
hit a little snag finding the one in the basement
then as if a starting gun has been fired burnham leaps to his feet and races out of the bedroom
that same starting gun has been fired in the panic room
with a strong rip meg pulls the whole bundle of multi colored wires out of the wall and drops onto the floor with it
she trusts it at sarah finds a wire cutter in the assorted tools and gives her that too
strip em expose the ends try blue first blue is phones
blue is phones
yes no i dont know do em all
while sarah goes to work on the wires meg turns to the phone itself the one with the buried phone line that isnt working yet
she rips the phone out of its housing tears free the wire on the end of it
burnham flies down the stairs from the third floor races across the foyer flies down the stairs to the kitchen floor
burnham races across the kitchen floor whips open a door and heads down another narrow darkened stairway
meg and sarah are like animals clawing and tearing at the ends of their respective phone cables foregoing tools and stripping the wires with fingers and teeth its faster
with the phone receiver cradled on her shoulder meg starts twisting the ends of wires onto the exposed ends of the wires from the phone unit
first wire nothing
she tries a second wire
burnham slams open the door to a dark room pulls the string on a bare bulb
god damn it
without light he cant see a thing
he smacks the bulb it swings wildly smashes on the cement wall
he turns and races out of the room
meg tries another wire
still no dial tone
sarah shoves another wire at her
she tries again
she moves on
burnham slides to his knees snatches a flashlight from his duffel leaps up and takes off again
meg shrieks and punches
burnham flies down the stairs flashlight beam bouncing crazily in front of him
the phone is ringing
an operator picks up
emergency im at west please hold
its a mechanical voice which gives over to muzak
burnham bangs through the door again starts searching the darkened mechanical room shining harsh light around its dingy walls
muzak continues to play
no more time to hold
meg hangs up the phone dials another number a seven digit one she knows by heart
in the mechanical room the bouncing flashlight beam falls on a metal cabinet across the way
burnham runs to it flings it open
slams it shut
meg listens as a phone rings on the other end
and rings again
this is torture
burnham turns sees another smaller metal box this one clearly labeled on the other end of the phone a husky male voice answers clearly hes been awakened
listen to me
there are three with a subhuman roar of anger burnham rips the entire phone panel off the wall with his bare hands
with an abrupt shriek the line goes dead
meg pauses cant believe it
she looks up see sarah looking at her her eyebrows arches her face all hope
meg keeps her cool but it take a hell of an effort
sarah reads her face
she turns away
she hangs up the phone
sarah goes to a corner of the room faces away from her
meg doesnt know what to say
hell do something
hell know were in trouble
he heard me i said there are three
he wont even know who it was
what would you think in the middle of the night
i mean three what three bears
hell call the police
hes just across the park this is why we got places so close to each other in case we needed each other were still a family hell help us
he he will
she practically shouted
sarah drop her head into her arms
i was trying not to tell you
im dizzy and thirsty
this is very bad news
tired burnham drags himself back up the stairs and into the doorway of the master bedroom
raoul and junior stand there staring at him
shes never coming out
and were never getting in
do me a favor and dont talk
jesus what was i thinking
meg has torn open one of the water packets and is trying to get sarah to drink but the little girl has gone completely pale and seems to have lost
some of the strength in her neck shes having trouble holding her head up
most of the water runs down her chin
come on come on
stay with me
you gotta drink
she takes sarahs hand checks her wristwatch thing
the readout is now she swallows
she grabs sarah by the face

what about us
junior thinks then pulls out his wallet
he thrusts a fistful of bills at them
for your time
they both just stare at him
five hundred bucks here
neither one of them moves to take it
junior shurgs drops it on the floor
he heads for the door expecting raoul to block him but as he draws close raoul just steps out of the way
junior passes through and heads for the stairs
were not leaving
im getting in that room and im opening that safe
lookin doubtful there big guy but ten out of ten for attitude
and he disappears down the stairs burnham still pleading with him
meg rifles the foodstuffs that are stored in the room
sarah in the corner is starting to tremble
what if i spazz out
forced calm no biggie weve been through it a dozen times i just jab you with the glucogen
she keeps looking
where is the glucogen
oh you know its uh
its in the little fridge in your room
pause im sorry mom
hey quit apologizing youre starting to sound like grandma
youre not gonna have an attack
she lays back oddly passive her lips changing color
she stares at the monitors
junior strides into the living room purposefully
he tosses some tools into his duffel bag and heads for the stairs down to the kitchen
burnham is behind him
would you wait
would you please just wait a minute
but junior heads down
raoul is just coming down from upstairs
junior reaches the door of the kitchen tries to open it realizes its screwed shut
he takes out a screwdriver and starts unscrewing the screws
burnham stops at the stairway
you walk out that door and you lose your share of the money
i mean it
he gets the last screw out throws open the door and blast of wind gusts in its a blustery night out there he takes a step into the doorway and
with a quiet pffft from right behind burnham a bullet whizzes across the kitchen and hits junior in the back of the head
he crumples right in the open kitchen doorway
burnham shouts incoherently and turns
raoul is standing there two steps up a silencer twisted onto the barrel of his gun
sarah is staring at the video monitors eyes wide
she raises one trembling finger points at the kitchen monitor tries to mouth the words cant
meg looks up
burnham is freaking out but trying to stay calm
oh my god
raoul walks past him calmly grabs junior by the ankles and drags him back into the house
he turns looks at burnham whose jaw is dropped in horror
you should see the look on your face
the fuck did you do that for
fuckin asshole thinks he knows me
drives his german car up to th street a couple of times buys a few rounds thinks hes a tough guy thinks he knows me
to the corpse you dont know one thing about me
while burnham stares down at the body in shock and raoul stares at burnham his back to the outside a small thin voice comes from the still open doorway
what the h they turn
a man fiftyish stands there in hastily thrown on clothes staring down at the dead body in mute shock
meg watching the monitors with sarah gasps as she sees the man whose name is harris
while she and sarah watch they see the silent image of harris set upon by raoul who grabs him roughly and drags him inside
burnham hurries to the door and slams it shut
he puts his back to it thinking terrified things are spinning out of control fast
raoul in the middle of the kitchen floor is venting some more of his rage on harris whom he has hurled to the floor
he lands a solid boot in the side of harriss head leaving him groaning in pain completely disoriented
harris rolls groggily into the spreading pool of blood coming from underneath junior
turning on him whos the clown now
whos the fucking clown now
he pulls his gun shoves it into burnhams eye hard we can hear the faint sizzle of skin burning
its burning my eye
i have the gun
raoul pulls the gun back just an inch
the skin around burnhams eye is an angry red
his eyes dart strain to look over at harris moaning on the floor
and at junior dead
what do you want me to do
what do you think
get us into that room
raoul pushes the gun barrel back into burnhams eye socket
youre full of ideas
you just need to squeeze one out
you got till the count of three
then you end up like him
he tilts his head over to junior whose brains are spreading out on the kitchen floor
this is ridiculous
i cant just
th okay okay
you got an idea
yeah i got an idea
i gotta check something
raoul grunts satisfied
pulls the gun back
burnham slides away shaking
he bends down to the floor
he looks at harriss left hand
at his index finger
he sees a white strip of skin where harris wore his wedding ring until recently
harris still semi conscious is hurled against the metal door of the panic room
he collapses at its base
burnham bends down next to him
i know you can hear me
your wife and kid are in there
youre gonna get em to come out
or he looks up at raoul hulking overhead gun in hand
or i cant stop what hes gonna do
do you understand
harris regaining some semblance of consciousness nods feebly
burnham stands up turns to the video camera and shouts
sarah and meg see the horrifying sight on the video monitors
burnham shouts at the door to the room
they see burnham standing over harris they faintly hear him call to them to open the door
and then they hear another voice calling back to them
sarah sits up recognizes her fathers voice
harris is shouting against the closed door
hes silenced by a vicious kick to the ribs
raoul begins to beat him
burnham stands by powerless horrifies watching as raoul savages harris who continues to call out as long as he has strength telling meg not to open the door no matter
meg and sarah shout in horror she covers her daughters face turn her away from the screen screams in incoherent anger of her own
but she doesnt open the door
burnham shouts at raoul pleading
but raoul whips the gun up into burnhams throat backing him off shutting him up
he resumes his pounding of harris
burnham turns looks up at the camera in the corner of the room
he cant stand it anymore
he whips off his jacket runs to the camera and covers the lens
while meg watches the monitor that cover the master bedroom abruptly goes black mercifully sparing them the sight of harriss beating
she holds sarah whos sobbing shaking
harris finally lapses into unconsciousness
raoul stands over him chest heaving
burnham stand in the doorway neither in nor out of the room a silhouette head hung
meg tries desperately to see something on the bedroom monitor but its hopeless its covered
on the hallway monitor she can just see shadows as two men in the bedroom lift a third off the floor and carry him across the room
a sudden beeping sound tears her attention away
still holding sarah she pulls her back off her shoulder
her face is completely white her lips blue her eyes rolled back into her head
the beeping sound grows louder she checks sarahs wristwatch the reading is dire meg gasps horrifies
oh god oh my god
sarah begins to convulse she bucks right out of megs arms and falls back onto the floor of the panic room
meg clears everything away from her tries to make room for her
the convulsion worsens
meg searches through the piles of supplies comes up with a plastic handled screwdriver
she opens sarahs jaws wedges the plastic handle between her teeth
she helps sarah ride out the convulsion
finally her eyes roll back into her head she slowly re orients herself
sarah reaches over turns off her still beeping wristwatch monitor herself
sarah sighs a shuddering sigh of relief but she is nowhere near normal
her skin has passed through white and is turning a sallow yellow color
she moves her lips meg cant hear her she bends down you gotta jab me mommy
meg turns looks back at the monitors
what she sees is good news the jacket has been removed from the bedroom camera
burnham and raoul are gone the only person there is harris who lies slumped on the far side of the bed
meg looks quickly over at the monitor for the living room
she sees burnham and raoul having an urgent conversation burnham sitting in a chair raoul pacing in front of him ranting
megs face lights up she practically laughs shes so overjoyed at this turn of events
she turns looks back at sarah who is starting to tremble again
that does it
meg leaps up hits the button that controls the steel door and it starts to crank open almost impossibly slowly
meg steps out of the panic room into the master bedroom
she looks at harris on the bed
with his back to her she cant even tell if hes alive or dead but first things must be first so she turns and races out of the room
meg flies up the stairs bare feet on padded carpet
in the living room raoul looks up hearing the pitter pat of her feet on the stairs above
he smiles and pulls his ski mask back on to cover his face
coming around behind him we see burnham sitting in the chair
except it isnt burnham at all its harris unconscious wearing burnhams shirt
and if harris is the person in the chair that means the person on the bed in the bedroom is burnham wearing harriss shirt
his eyes pop open he sits up sees the wide open door to the panic room
meg races into sarahs bedroom and tears open the door of a mini fridge
inside are dozens of little bottles of insulin and something called glucogen
she grabs a bottle of glucogen and a black leather pouch and takes off
as meg nears the bottom of the stairs she sees a horrifying sight
its raoul ski mask over his face standing in the doorway of the master bedroom
she screams he slams the door she takes off down the hall reaches the end throws the door open and races into the master bedroom where raoul is motoring fast
headed for the panic room where she can already see burnham standing in the middle of the open doorway in front of sarah wearing harriss shirt and a grim tricked you expression
meg hurls herself at raoul lands clinging to his back
she claws and wrestles with him gets one hand on his ski mask tears it from his head
he reaches up to try to stop her from pulling it off his gun slips from his fingers falls to the floor and caroms off his boot spinning across the
floor away from them
raoul flips her off his back violently she crunches to the floor clutching his mask and getting a good long look at his face
he makes a move toward his gun but shes faster shes already pawing herself frantically across the hardwood toward it
raoul measures the distance knows hell lose and sprints for the panic room instead
meg turns looks down at the medicine in her hands then at the door to the panic room where raoul is right now reaching up to push the button that
controls the steel door
she makes a fast decision and lunges hurling the plastic bottle of glucogen and the black leather pouch through the gap just before the spring loaded steel door slams shut
with tremendous ferocity
and then its silent
meg wails in agony pounds on the door
she stands back chest heaving sobbing
a looooong moment goes by
finally a voice comes over the houses intercom system
calmly if you leave the house well kill her
if i see a uniform in the house well kill her
meg looks up at the camera in the master bedroom
she nods terrified
burnham pushes past raoul at the speaker button and leans forward
hes approaching exhaustion
into speaker i just
i just need forty five minutes
raoul stands behind him muttering to himself
saw my face man
saw my face
we see megs face agonized as she lunges toward the camera screaming something up at it the same thing over and over
but in here her voice is nearly muted what bleeds through the walls isnt enough to be heard
raoul looks at her image on the monitor irritated
we abruptly hear her voice full throated
shouting into the camera cine she needs the medicine
sarah shivers in a corner knees pulled up to her chest staring at the intruders scared out of her wits and looking very very sick
burnham looks at her musters the most reassuring face he can come up with under the circumstances
its gonna be cool kid
be outta here before you know it
no response from sarah
burnham cocks a head really looking at her
are you okay
hurry up for christs sake
burnham turns grabs his satchel and drops to his knees in the middle of the floor
over his shoulder we can see the face of meg on one of the monitors shouting into the camera begging them to give sarah her medicine
using his hand burnham measures six lengths in from the wall then digs his fingernails into the weave of the carpet looking for a seam
he finds one gets hold of it on one edge and runs his other hand along the seam till he finds a place where it seems to turn a corner
he stands hovering over the carpet and pulls back evenly with both hands
the concealed carpet flap pulls back neatly with the soft sound of tearing velcro
underneath the flap is the smooth metal door of a floor safe
burnham unsnaps his satchel and gives it a shove
it rolls out and opens up onto the floor revealing a neat array of safecracking tools
he begins his delicate work but is suddenly jarred by a pounding on the metal door
he turns annoyed
meg is still screaming outside the door
the hell does she want
i dont know she keeps screamin the same thing over and over
burnham turns looks at the monitors
meg is staring up at the camera miming the act of giving herself an injection in the arm
she wants drugs
what the fuck
but burnham thinks
his eyes fall on the bottle and the leather pouch she hurled through the door then whip over to sarah who sags over into a fetal position on the floor
her lips are moving
he crawls over to sarah puts his ear down next to sarahs lips
what is it
sarah tries to summon enough strength to speak but her breath comes hard
burnham points to the pouch and the glucogen on the floor nearby
sarah nods again
can you do it yourself
sarah shakes her head no
well i dont know how
sarah looks at him eyes pleading
raoul stands behind burnham
i dont fucking believe this
to sarah you gotta wait
sarah just looks at burnham
yeah just like a half hour maybe a little more and your momll give it to you
you can wait a half hour cant you
shes fine shes just like tired shes gotta rest
you rest kid
half an hour
sarah looks terrified shaking her head no
he starts to pull burnham away but burnham shakes his hand off violently
he bends down very close to sarahs lips
tell me the truth okay
whats gonna happen if you dont get this
sarah swallows licks her cracking lips
when she speaks its breathy almost inaudible
but the words are clear
seen from overhead meg paces in the master bedroom out of her mind with worry no idea how to communicate to the people in the room the desperate situation
suddenly a voice comes over the intercom speaker
ill give her the shot
a hand comes down into frame and picks up the glucogen and the leather pouch
burnham stands looking down at them
raoul grabs him pulls him to the far end of the room
youre wasting your fucking time man youre wasting my time
you dont know how to do this and the longer we stay in here the more likely shes gonna lose it and call the cops
are you gonna open the safe
raoul looks at him
then shut up and get out of my way
as burnham crosses the room raoul makes eye contact with sarah who is staring at him
dont look at me
burnham drops to his knees next to sarah and unzips the pouch
okay kid all i know about this is what ive seen on tv you gotta talk me through it
sarah tries to form words but shes too weak
tv dont lie right
he reaches into the pouch take out a syringe a sterile pad and a length of rubber tubing
he takes sarahs arm stretches it out exposing the underside of her forearm
you seem like a good kid
only saw her for a second but woah
burnham ties the rubber tubing around sarahs arm pulls it tight
hey nod or something show me youre still alive will ya
that too tight
sarah shakes her head no
burnham takes the syringe starts to fill it from the glucogen bottle
you guys are pretty rich huh
while burnham goes through the process of finding an exposed vein and giving the injection itself he goes on as much to comfort sarah as to comfort himself yeah you
dont think about that stuff
good for you
he looks at her sees her looking at him
thinking about him
i know i know
i really screwed the pooch this time
i never did anything like this before
break into somebodys house
not even close
bad cards kid
i swear to god i been on the wrong end of maybe six straight years of bad cards
snaps his fingers gone those are some seriously bad cards
and still every time i pick up a fresh hand i swear to god the rush comes so hot and prickly i feel it right down to my toes because
this time this one time it might be there this time it might be that hand that perfect hand that monster hand
shakes his head and you thought you were sick
the shot successfully given he pulls sarahs sleeve back down
sarah nods and she seems better already
burnham helps her to sit up to lean against the wall
woulda been a hell of a dad
a voice comes over the intercom in the master bedroom
now sit down and wait
he clicks off
meg is hugely relieved
and extremely pissed off
she goes to the corner of the room and picks up the gun the one that raoul dropped
she heads downstairs
sparks fly as burnham goes to work on the floor safe with a small specialized drill
raoul bends down next to him
you saved her life for ten minutes
burnham looks up at him what
but raoul turns and walks away
burnham goes back to work
meg is in the living room with harris who is still slouched in the chair
hes in awful shape barely conscious
out of the silence a sudden deafening sound
her eyes go wide
she darts a look over to the door the one that leads to the stoop not the bloody kitchen door downstairs then back at harris
gasps you called the police
this is exactly what she prayed for him to do now its the worst thing that could happen
she stands thinking desperate
she walks toward the door stops thinks some more
the doorbell rings again
she comes up with a plan
she goes back to where harris is in the chair pulls the chair back a few feet out of view of the door
she puts the gun in his lap puts his hand over it to steady it
she leans down whispers to him
meg takes a breath walks across the foyer tousling her hair as she goes
raoul is staring at the monitors aghast
burnham races over looks over his shoulder
one monitor covers the front stoop and on that monitor they can clearly see two uniformed cops
shes fuckin crazy she killed the kid
she just killed her own kid
its not her fault its not her fault the guy must have called them
look look look shes telling us
he points to another monitor the one in the foyer where meg is looking up at the camera miming to them dont worry ill take care of this
shes gonna handle it
megs shaking hand rises up to the doorknob and pulls open the big front door
on the stoop the two cops turn to look at her
she acts as if shes just been awakened
she looks it too still in t shirt and boxer shorts
the wind is gusty and cold outside
are you all right
what are you guys what time is it
bout four oclock
i dont get it
we got a call
cop looks at him
cop stops talking
somebody called you
can we come in
what do you want
wed like to come in
no you cant come in

who called you
you dont look so good
you wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me i look like hell

im freezing here thank you for checking can i go
cop studies her notices the burned sleeve of her t shirt the black smudges still on her face
your husband says you said there are three
right before you got cut off
oh that phone call
cop takes a step forward and lowers his voice to just above a whisper unconsciously making her lean forward in order to hear him
maam if theres something you want to say to us right now that maybe you cant say to us right now maybe you just want to make a signal by
blinking a few times something like that
she just looks at him
wow this guys intuitive
she is sorely tempted
but she cant
thats something you could do
she thinks thinks and burst out laughing
man you are good
you mean like if somebody was in the house or something
thats great they really train you guys these days dont they
cop looks at her not sure if he believes her or not
cross my heart
cop turns to go but cop lingers
may i ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be
the sentence that started there are three
what was the rest
she stares at him
my husband and i just broke up
its my first night in the new house and i was feeling a little lonely and a little drunk
the sentence if you insist on knowing was going to be there are three things ill do for you if you come over right now and get in bed with
cop stifles a laugh
but thank god i came to my senses before i said all that and hung up instead so nobody would ever know what i was thinking unless of course two
policemen showed up in the middle of the night to interrogate me about it
that was good
cop is embarrassed
cop thinks its funny
you want her to show you which three things rick or should we just go
cop looks at meg a long look he holds it for one last moment trying to read her mind
we see the video image of the cops as they turn and head away down the front steps
meg closes the doors looks up into a camera right at us
burnham and raoul breathe a sigh of relief
burnham goes back to work on the safe
hes making progress
raoul looks at sarah
hes thinking too
he moves over crouches down next to burnham
she saw my face
the kid too
sarah overhears that
she raises her head alarmed
burnham turns looks over at her and she just gets her head back down in time
burnham and raoul close themselves off for a private conversation
sarah edges closer
she overhears a fragment
thats your problem
thats their problem
sarah is terrified
doesnt know what to do
she looks to her immediate left sees the intercom panel
she edges closer
let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here
then we finish
sarah sneaks up a hand and pushes a button all page
in the living room there is an audible click as the speaker is activated
meg looks up hears burnhams voice in the middle of a sentence
posed to mean
youre here with me youre already on the hook for one
buy one you get the rest for the same price
you know that
get the fuck away from me
the kid in here
the other two when we come out
meg listens horrified
sarah holds the intercom button down with a trembling finger
you know how this gotta end
meg stares in shock as raouls voice echoes in the empty room
they stay in the house
there in an abrupt click and the speaker turns off
meg turns goes to harris falls to her knees no idea what to do
she holds him close their foreheads touching
shes terrified exhausted wants to collapse in his arms
instead she starts to pull the gun from his fingers
he tightens his grip what are you doing
he tries to hold onto the gun but she pulls his fingers off it takes it away from him
he is too weak to resist
in the panic room sarah has her hands clamped over her ears her mouth is wide open and a hideous metal shriek seems to be coming out of it
but the shriek is actually coming from the safe where burnham continues to work another drill a bigger bit
the noise is deafening
sarah sees her mother approaching the monitor in the bedroom carrying a jacket
meg tosses the jacket this time she doesnt want them to see what shes doing
the monitor goes black
in the master bedroom meg pulls on a pair of jeans that are hanging over a chair
she steps into a pair of boots
she shoves the gun into her belt
here in the bedroom she can hear the drill
from the house next door she hears pounding again more muffled curses
apparently the neighbor can hear the drill too
meg looks from the walls of the bedroom to the walls of the panic room
her eyes light up with an idea
she goes to the front wall of the bedroom stands with her back against the exterior wall street side with her left shoulder against the common wall thats shared with
the neighbors brownstone
she begins to step off the distance heel to toe measuring with her feet until she reaches the metal door that is the entrance to the panic room
she hurries out of the bedroom
whats she doing
meg comes into a small room full of empty bookshelves a library
there is a window that looks out over the sidewalk one floor up same level as the stoop
she looks up into the corners of the room
no camera no camera no camera
theyre bare no video cameras
she goes to the window tries to open it
screwed shut of course
the safe is almost cracked
raoul is watching the monitors carefully
we see meg as she searches through the tools in the living room finds a screwdriver a sledgehammer
raoul furrows his brow
meg is back in the library hurriedly unscrewing the window
she gets the last screw out shoves the window up
the wind blasts in its a hell of a spooky night out there
she leans out the window
we lean with her
the sidewalk is empty we see it only from our vantage point inside the house
shes one floor up
to her right is the houses front stoop
she tosses the sledgehammer over onto the stoop
climbs up onto the window ledge and slithers out herself
we lean further watch her as she edges along the ledge hops down onto the stoop and freezes staring in horror at the video camera that covers the front stoop
we see her staring straight up at the camera clearly standing on the front stoop outside the house where she was specifically told not to go
sarah sees the image of her on the stoop
raoul happens to be looking away at the moment at the safe but he starts to turn around to look at the monitors again and sarah kicks him hard in
he turns away from the monitors
cant control it sometimes
raoul scowls at her
behind him meg darts down the front steps and disappears from view on the monitor
sarah sees her mother go
to raoul wont happen again
still leaning out the window we can see meg from here as she reaches the sidewalk and runs up the front steps of the neighbors house which is contiguous
straining to see yet stay in the house we see meg all the way at the right edge of the frame as she shifts the gun to the back of
her pants and knocks on the neighbors door sledgehammer held slightly behind her leg
after a long moment we hear the neighbors front door open
the conversation begins
the wind is gusting right in our faces we cant make out the details but the gist is clear let me into your house and dont as me a lot
the neighbor and by the tone of the voice it sounds like an old woman is slow to respond grumpy
losing patience meg just pulls the neighbor out of the way and shoves into the house
the neighbor stumbles out onto her front stoop and we were right its an old lady in a nightgown but shes no shrinking violet
in fact shes royally pissed off and not at all intimidated
what the hell do you think youre doing young lady
she storms back into her house following meg
as both of them disappear from the frame we move out of the library into the foyer and move along the common wall the one shared with the neighbors brownstone
from the other side of the wall we can hear muffled voices arguing meg and the neighbor shouting at each other
we drift up up the stairs and hear the thundering of footsteps on the stairs next door
we keep pace with them from inside this house
we pass right through the floor and rise up out of the floor in the master bedroom and now we can hear the conversation on the other side of the
wall in here the neighbors fearful angry tones megs firm urgent declarations
we move with meg even though we cant see her we know what shes doing shes stepping off the paces on the other side of the wall
we drift down that wall fourteen steps until we reach the metal door to the panic room then we pass through that door and arrive inside the panic room where
burnham is this close to getting the safe open when all of a sudden burnham and raoul freeze alarmed
its coming from the long wall the shared wall
they look at each other
they look at the wall
somebody is on the other side pounding like hell
the walls are steel right
not that one
hey man its the neighbors house who breaks in through the neighbors house
burnham turns screams at the wall
weve got the kid
shouting at the wall weve got your kid
what the fuck is she thinking
shes got your gun thats what shes thinking
the fuck you had to bring a gun for
burnham throws himself back on the floor goes back to work on the safe
fires up the drill again it screams into the metal
the pounding keeps up from next door
we hear sheetrock torn away on the far side
bricks scraping out of place
sarah in the corner is energized excited
while burnham and raoul are distracted she grabs the leather pouch palms the three syringes that are left in there
finally the door to the safe crunches in on one side yielding to the drilling at the very moment that the head of a sledgehammer crashes through the wall of
the panic room
raoul grabs hold of sarah burnham maintains his focus throwing open the safe revealing nothing
the sledgehammer head strikes again opening up a hole about a foot across
light spills through from the other side as well as the voice of the hysterical neighbor
raoul hurls sarah against the far wall leaps over to the side of the hole and waits poised above it
at the safe burnham doesnt lose his cool just opens a false bottom in the safe revealing a manila envelope
he snatches it up rips it open and his eyes dance as he holds up fourteen individual one million dollar u s treasury bearer bonds
he fans them out eyes drinking from his grail
a gunshot whizzes right through one of the bonds setting it aflame before it slams into the far wall sending up a little cloud of plaster dust
he whirls sees an arm poking through the hole in the wall gun extended
but raoul is standing just above the hole and already has his boot raised over the hand
he brings it down a crunching blow that stomps right on megs wrist
meg screams loses her grip on the gun and it clatters into the space between the houses
the gun falls into oblivion the space between the walls where no one can get to it
burnham shoves the loose bonds into his jacket
raoul grabs sarah and turns jabs the green button to open the door
behind them meg screams in anger and wriggles through the opening
before shes even all the way through she gets hold of raouls leg and pulls herself into the panic room scraping and bloodying herself on the edges of the too
but raoul is deep in a violent rage
still holding sarah with one hand he bends down grabs meg by the hair and drags her toward the doorway
he bolts out of the room through the metal door which is just finishing its slow crank open its heavy spring coiling in the wall
raoul drag meg across the floor by the hair right into the track of the open steel door
she looks up sees the infrared safety beam over her head and realizes with horror what his intention is
still with one arm holding sarah who is kicking and struggling viciously raoul holds megs head down on the floor below the safety beam that would prevent the door from
he reaches for the close button
sarah raises her arm stuffed with three syringes and jabs them into raouls neck
raoul screams in pain
meg manages to raise her head breaking the beam
on the stairwell burnham stops frozen his face twitching with indecision
he hears the murder taking place just above him
he runs down three steps
runs down the rest of the stairs
raoul stretches to push the red close button for the door but he has to hold megs head down out of the lower beam with one hand all with sarah
savagely attacking him at the same time and three syringes hanging out of his neck
finally he gets megs head all the way down onto the floor
looking up meg sees the red beam become complete again
raoul jabs the button just as sarah throws her hand into the upper beam the one at shoulder level
sarahs hand turns red the beam is broken the door will not close
raoul roars in anger and twists violently sending sarah flying across the room
meg strains gets her head off the floor again breaking the beam
raoul starts jamming the close button over and over again the beam completes then breaks completes then breaks never the button and the beam at the same time
but it cant go on forever
megs tiring she cant keep it up her head trembles and collapses onto the floor
the beam completes raoul smacks the red button and burnham appears on the other side of the door
he reaches in grabs hold of raoul to pull him off her but raoul loses his balance falls forward into the gap and his head is crushed by the spring
loaded steel door that slams forward just as meg draws herself back
meg falls across the panic room grabs sarah and holds on tight
the door detects the obstruction and opens again slowly
raouls body slumps to the floor dead
burnham stands there looking down at meg and sarah
they stare at each other wordless their first face to face contact
she sees the bonds protruding from his jacket
she just looks at him
there will be no understanding here
he zips his jacket turns and hurries away
burnham races down the steps hurries to the entry door throws it open and finds a gun barrel pointed directly into his nose
he blinks tries to focus on whoevers on the other end of that gun
its the cop the first cop the one who came to the door and was so suspicious of meg
the cop looks down sees blood smeared all over burnhams jacket sees more than enough to know his suspicions were correct
put your hands up
burnham freezes silhouetted in the doorway
wind and leaves blow into the house a real gale outside
from behind cop more cops shout all at once must be a half dozen of em there but burnham cant see anything in the stinging light and cant hear much
either over the roaring wind
burnham moves suddenly flinging the door shut right in the cops face
the door slams hard burnham turns to run but doesnt get more than a few paces before three sharp gunshots crack through the door behind him
brilliant white light spills through the bulletholes in the door but its not the light that gets you its the chunks of lead
they rip through burnhams back and come out his chest a triangle pattern
burnham stops sags to his knees
he reaches into his jacket pulls out the loose stack of bonds
he fans them out stares down at them holds them like playing cards
behind him the front door cracks open half a dozen cops appear and start shouting all at once
burnham tosses the bonds to the floor the same gesture as folding a hand of poker
he groans and collapses slowly falling through the bonds twisting as he goes down
he slaps onto his back in the foyer as the wind gusts through the open door scoops the bonds up off the floor and blows them back into the house
as if they were never meant to leave
burnham lies there on the floor eyes open staring up at the ceiling looking at the bonds that swirl in the blast of air suspended there twisting and bucking and
diving just over his head as he dies
the swirling bonds melt into swirling leaves blowing in the air over central park on a crisp fall day
the leaves float down over the great lawn that massive expanse of grass we saw in megs hallucination
but on a day like this the great lawns full of people throwing frisbees playing football lying there doing nothing
the leaves land on the grass next to meg and sarah stretched out on a blanket a newspaper spread in front of them open to the ads
meg is on her back arms folded behind her head staring up at the clouds
sarah is intent on the paper circling the occasional ad
i mean uptown is close to dads place but somebody at school said the village is really cool so
i dont know its so great to be close to the park and everything
what do you think i mean give me a clue here where are we gonna live
meg rolls over props herself up on one elbow
she seems years younger
she looks at sarah reaches out brushes her daughters hair behind one ear
she is calm
behind her a flock of pigeons takes off leaping into the clear autumn sky
