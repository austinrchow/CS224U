screenplay by woody allen marshall brickman most of the sequences in this production are filmed using a hand held camera or a steadycam
these very mobile cameras move around the set and get constantly closer and further from the characters
still well be using the usual technical terms such as long shot or full shot or medium shot here and there to give the reader an idea of the location
of the camera at the beginning of each sequence
and then well mention the movements of the camera
winged white horse flying over clouds we hear jazz music during the credits
while the camera is flying over new york we keep on hearing the jazz music
the camera reaches a round building that looks like a stadium and starts moving around the building
long shot on the skating rink
a hockey game is in progress on the rink
the camera follows a player and then pans on the audience
the camera stops on a medium shot of larry and carol a couple in their early fifties
larry seems fascinated by the game but carol seems to find it boring
she looks at the ceiling and then puts her hand over her mouth to suppress a yawn
larry turns toward her
you promised to sit through the entire hockey game without being bored and ill sit through the wagner opera with you next week
i know honey i promised
i already bought the earplugs
well with your eyesight im surprised you can see the puck
the crowd starts yelling and we guess that one of the players has done something really good
carol mockingly claps her hands
then she raises her eyes to the ceiling seeming more bored than ever
a nice looking apartment building in new york
full shot of the lobby
we see the street through the glass door
an uniformed attendant is standing near a counter on which he is writing on a book
larry and carol are coming from the street and entering the building
he is carrying some shopping bags and she is reading a newspaper the daily news
i cant wait to get into bed and stretch out
the attendant slightly turns around and bows to them
they bow back to him
he goes back to his book keeping and the couple keeps on walking through the lobby
you know theres a bob hope movie on television later

well its an alternative lifestyle
yeah ill say
they reach the two elevators
larry presses the call button on the wall between the two elevators

paul voice over hold the elevator
paul and lilian enter the elevator
they are a middle aged couple

the elevator door slides shut
lilian looks at carol
i uh i see you at the gym sometimes

oh god yeah
i agree with you
exercising changed my life
i prefer to atrophy
im not a very exercise person
we bought a treadmill last week
oh well we had one
but you know we got rid of it because it was just taking up too much space
oh it it it
because you have to turn it on and get on it once in a while
that was her problem
and its so confusing with all those buttons and computerized programs
im just never gonna get that
full shot of a very sober and modern hallway
creme colored walls grey carpeting dark wooden doors
we hear the elevator door opening and carol comes out followed by lilian larry and paul
they all talk together and we can hardly understand the following dialogue
oh i know
its so wonderful meeting
oh well yeah
it is just like new york
you have neighbors
you never meet them
the following line said by lilian is clearer and we understand it better
ive seen you so many times in the hallway you know
and ive always wanted to come up and say hallo
larry and carol walk away from lilian and paul who remain near the elevator
carol voice over good night
such a lovely couple
you know that
paul bends down to pick up something on the carpet
lilian walks one step in larrys direction
oh uh say hello
paul starts opening his apartment door just across the hallway from the elevator
carol voice over huh

i mean wed really love that
the camera pans around toward larry and carol
larry makes a negative sign with his hand
oh oh well thatd be fine
paul voice over she makes great irish coffee
mute conversation between carol and larry
larry evidently doesnt want to accept lilians invitation but carol wants to
lillian voice over oh please
uh uh i want you to give me a treadmill lesson
theres a movie on television i want to watch
carol starts walking toward lilian and pauls apartment followed reluctantly by larry
the camera pans around during carols next line and we see carol entering lilian an pauls apartment
oh about the tread
oh well if i can figure it out then believe me anybody can
she laughs and larry entering the apartment behind her utters a forced laugh
the cosy apartment of middle upper class people
the decoration looks like them
medium shot of lilian walking across the bedroom toward the large double bed
she walks near the famous treadmill

lilian brings the book to carol
look at these diagrams

she is standing near the treadmill
lilian shows her one of the diagram in the book
i cant understand this even
let me see
one of the wall could be a bay window but for the moment it is entirely covered by a beige drape
medium shot of paul bringing a stamp book to larry
now let me show you a mint airmail
and very beautiful
larry is seated near a small table on which paul puts the book down
paul sits down next to larry
paul picks up a special philatelist magnifying glass and puts it in front of the stamp for larry to have a better look at it
look at that
and this plate block is quite unique because it has a flaw in the engraving
see if you can see it
larry who is not interested in philately at all scratches his head
uh its hard for me
actually ill give you a little hint
right down here in the corner
that tiny thing there
ah you have a really
that makes it quite valuable you see
and i just got a commemorative set of issues that are going to be quite valuable too
he picks up a transparent envelope inside which are several stamps
look at the color right there

we see pauls hand on larrys shoulder pushing him toward the centre of the room
a little later
full shot of the room
they are all seated around a low table larry and carol on the sofa paul and lilian on two armchairs
theyve just finished their coffee
well weve never had any children but its easy to empathize
oh um uh what college does your son attend
they all laugh
paul never attended college
hes self made
always regretted it
i think knowledge is the second most important thing
first is health then knowledge then money
larry puts his cup down on the low table
you know its amazing how time we
and do you work
larry stands up
larry looks at carol and sits back on the sofa
oh well i actually um i used to work at an ad agency but that was many years ago
the camera moves closer to carol and larry
you know ive been seriously thinking of starting a little restaurant
but well larry hes trying to talk me out of it
oh shes a great cook though really
her duck and fennel omelette on a bed of scallops and hollandaise sauce with truffles and sweetbreadsll make you snap into a fetal position and have you in bed screaming

we hear a door opening
jesus couldnt you keep the conversation going a little longer in there
lights are switched on
we see only part of the hall the camera being in a corridor and the walls of the corridor concealing part of the hall
carol enters the apartment and larry holds the door for her
i was signaling you frantically
larry closes the door
i was just trying to be neighborly
if this guy showed me his stamp collection one more time
i mean my favorite thing in life is to you know look at canceled postage
the camera follows larry walking in the corridor toward actually there are two large beds in the bedroom the room being divided by a partition set between the two beds

the camera is still on the sidewalk near the entrance of the building and we see carol and larry walking toward the elevators
a short black screen which actually is just a close shot on the outer door of the elevator
this door slides open and we get a medium shot of larry and carol inside the elevator

she never once mentioned that she had a heart condition
well what is she gonna say
oh yeah hello im mrs
house and i have a bad heart
well she had no problem telling me about her hysterectomy in the first five minutes
it is much easier to talk about a hysterectomy than it is to talk about a heart condition
you said she liked
she liked eating high cholesterol desserts
is that what you said
so she had one too many
she wasnt on a diet
we discussed diets
so she wasnt on a diet
this would be a really great way to kill somebody

medium shot of carol coming out of the bathroom
she switches the bathroom light off
she is wearing a pink night dress
the camera turns toward larrys bed in which larry is already lying
he has a book in his hands
you know i was thinking of fixing ted up with helen dubin
you know i figured they would just you know get into an argument over penis envy or something
the poor guy suffers from it so
carol puts something on the night table on her side of the bed
did he seem a little too cheerful
she looks at some pills bottles on the night table
no he seemed like his regular self to me but but uh when you brought up the notion of the restaurant
the guy lit up like mr
she picks up a hair brush
he sees himself as uh you know as humphrey bogart in casablanca
i i see him more as peter lorre wringing his hands
carol starts walking toward the other section of the room
the camera follows her
no no no

i mean mr
didnt seem a little too cheerful to you
larry voice over mr

carol stops in front of a large mirror set on the wall in one corner of the room

larry voice over uh uh
carol walks to a chest of drawers on top of which she drops the hairbrush

i mean you know
this guy should be a wreck
she sits down on her side of the bed and takes her socks off
while talking larry puts the book and his glasses on the night table
carol switches the light off on her night table and gets into the bed
meanwhile i cant get the the flying dutchman theme out of my mind you know
remind me tomorrow to buy up all the wagner records in town and rent a chainsaw
he switches the lights off on his bed table
the room is completely dark and we hear the next sentences on a black screen
helen dubins wrong for ted

medium shot of ted dressed in a night gown and standing near the counter of a restaurant
the room is very dark only lit by a lamp on the counter
i figured out how he killed her and made it look like a coronary
he gagged her and tied her to the treadmill and then he turned the exercise program up to the olympic levels
carols bursts out laughing
you know i mean i just think this guy is too perky
you know i mean hes not acting like a man whose beloved of twenty eight years died just a few days ago
larry is trying to get the telephone cord stretched from his night table to the handset hold by carol away from his face
jesus are you onto that

the camera pans to the kitchen
the conversation between paul and larry keeps going in the living room but we cant understand the words
carol puts water in the glass jar of the coffee machine
she puts the lid on the jar and turns around to put the jar in the machine
she looks in the coffee plastic container and notices there is no coffee inside
she bends down and opens the cupboard door
not finding any coffee in the cupboard she closes it stands up and turns around to look inside the cupboard above the sink
she closes it and bends down to look inside the cupboard next to the dishwasher
she seems surprised by something and pauses
then she takes a copper funeral urn from inside the cupboard
she stands up and takes the lid off the urn
she looks inside the urn and closes it
she seems a bit shocked and bends down to put the urn back inside the cupboard
then she stands up and looks absently around her
a little later

larry and carol are sitting next to each other on the sofa
carol is drinking coffee from a cup and larry is staring with his arms crossed on his chest looking a little bored
paul is sitting on an armchair and eating the floating islands from a plate he is holding in his other hand

while larry looks on the desk carol searches the rest of the room even kneeling on the floor
come over here

medium tracking shot of ted walking on the sidewalk coming from the lounge and toward us
medium low angle shot of one of the window of the lounge seen from the street

carol is seated in front of the window looking very pensive
she takes a sip of her glass of wine
she looks absently though the window
the street seen through the window next to which carol is seated but we dont actually see carol
we see a big car followed by a bus
the camera zooms on the bus
through one of the bus windows we see a woman seated inside the bus
and this woman looks very much like the deceased lilian pauls wife
close shot on the window in front of which carol is seated
she looks at the passing bus with a wide open mouth and a surprised almost frightened expression on her face

she reaches the staircase and walks downstairs
full view on the entrance of the lounge
carol is walking rapidly down the stairs leading to the entrance
she reaches the sidewalk and looks around her for the bus
she walks away from the lounge and toward us with the camera on a tracking shot in front of her
medium shot of larry working in the kitchen putting things away in the cupboards
behind him we see the front hall
the front door opens and carol walks in
i got a great sweater at brooks brothers today for nick today
carols closes the door and leans on the wall
but larry doesnt seem to understand that something is wrong with her
he walks away to the sitting room
he keeps on talking in voice over while carol is still leaning on the wall of the front hall
larry voice over really beautiful
the kid looked so handsome in it though
also i decided id cook dinner tonight
my one dish tuna casserole
larry comes back in the kitchen and looks at his wife but still doesnt seem to notice that something is wrong
we follow larry into the sitting room
larry is setting the table for dinner carol voice over well no wonder he had her cremated
carol voice over mrs

i thought wed have a light dinner you know because we had a rich lunch at twenty one i thought
the camera pans to carol standing at the entrance of the room and leaning on the wall larry

long shot of the entrance of the hotel seen from the other side of the street
a blue police car is parked in front of the hotel
two plainclothes police officers and one uniformed policeman are talking with carol and larry
they both try to explain the situation to the police officers
but since they both talk together the police officers have a hard time understanding them
while they are talking the camera zooms forward from a long shot to a full shot of the group
carol talking together with larry and then you see what happened was i suspected mr
he runs a movie house

larry voice over yeah she was definitely laying here
the camera pans from the uniformed policeman to the two police officers talking with carol and larry in the middle of the room
the following dialogue transcript separates what larry says from what carol says but most of the time they talk together at the same time making it quite difficult for us
or for the police officers to follow their conversation
because i mean she was she was there do you understand
the camera tilts down on one of the police officers looking under the bed
it looked like she was strangled or something

so theyll be there
all the way out to new jersey
so hey kid this is the apple
this is the town that never sleeps

vincents is a nice cosy place with dim lights tasteful decorations and light piano music
full shot of a table with the four customer seen in profile
larry is seated next to marcia and across from his wife
ted is seated next to carol
during the following conversation the camera moves around the table
uh you really saw his face
oh yes im here to tell you
you saw you saw what he looked like
you know exactly who it is
oh no question about it
it was it was mr
there was no
not a not a question
i mean you could see him because uh you know there was there was just no way that you could avoid it
he was right there
the camera stops on marcia and thus stops moving around the table
to me its obvious
how do you see it
what do you mean
obvious hes committed the perfect murder
what do you mean
what do you mean
you have to start off with another woman who bears some ballpark resemblance to mrs
thats what i said
i used the term ballpark resemblance myself
you used the term right
it was my idea
i said what she said
theyre with this woman
paul and another woman that looks like his wife are seated around a table having dinner
lilian house gives a glass of wine to the woman then another one to paul and kisses him on the forehead
marcia voice over maybe having dinner
they dont induce a heart attack because thats fiction bullshit
the woman has a hard attack
paul helps her to walk to the sofa
marcia voice over she has a heart attack
she drops dead spontaneously
they had no thought of killing her
maybe they wished she was dead
ted voice over why
marcia voice over i dont know
maybe they stood to gain if she died
they see a golden opportunity
lilian wearing a pink night robe is dressing the dead woman lying on the sofa into her own clothes
marcia voice over mrs
house dresses her up in her clothes
larry voice over this is my theory
exactly my theory
marcia voice over thats right
she checks into a hotel
back to the restaurant
long shot on the table
all the other tables are empty
the camera zooms to a full shot of the table marcia and larry facing us and carol and ted with their back to us
yeah well we got that far with the exception of the actual spontaneous heart attack
okay you know the husbands planning to go to paris with this pretty young woman
hes cheating on his wife
so instead of finishing the scheme they planned he double crosses her and kills her taking her share of the profits
well you think you think helen moss is in on this too huh
yeah a good chance shes aware
okay but what about mrs
he claims he took her to the movies
shes his alibi
she covered for him when he strangled his wife
she said he was at work all day
thats right because he introduced her as a colleague
marcia lights a cigarette
why would she
shes a colleague who maybe loves him
oh wait wait
hes cheating on her too
cheating on two women
yeah yeah yeah
just it all fits
the guy doesnt look the part
the point is hes gotten away with the perfect murder
there are no bodies around to prove anything
and all the paperwork is strictly above board
hes home free
oh where did you find this woman
shes a genius
but the guy
he knows that we know so if he knows were on him
well he doesnt care
why should he
everythings been neatly disposed of
hes home free
only he and maybe his mistress know the truth
shes right theres no body
hold on hold on for a second
we dont know this is all true
this is just a theory
yeah but its a great theory
have you been paying attention
this is a great theory
it sounds good it holds water
everything fits together in this
i am paying attention
i think its great
when i come back from the ladies room ill tell you how to trap him
she stands up and starts walking away to the toilets
larry and ted stand up too
they wait for her to be gone to sit back

after he ran away why couldnt you have retrieved the body
we couldnt have gotten her out of that

he was probably too scared to be very lucid
the camera pans to ted who looks at marcia with worshipping eyes
marcia voice over hes an amateur
he dumped the body and ran off and then somehow who knows the details you two dug her out

michael orson welles voice over from the film he never even did that
he went and shot broome
and that was not part of the plan
broome might have got to the police before he died
larry walks around the backstage trying to find his way
we see the black and white film on the screen but also reflections of the screen on the multiple mirrors scattered around the backstage
michael orson welles voice over from the film and if the cops traced it to grisby

michael orson welles voice over from the film one who follows his nature keeps his original nature in the end
larry inadvertently drops the large mirror on the floor
the mirror breaks with a crashing sound
carol voice over help
the camera pans to paul walking slowly with his gun pointed toward larry
they cant see us behind the screen and they cant hear us with the sound on
not even a gunshot
behind paul we see the film on the screen
we have now reached the famous last scene of the film shot in the hall of mirrors
rita hayworths face is reflected on the many mirrors in the film just like in the actual scene in the backstage paul and larry are reflected on the many mirrors
arthur everett sloane voice over from the film i knew id find you two together
arthurs figure walking with a cane is reflected in the many mirrors in the film
just the same gladys who has just entered the backstage walking with a cane is also reflected on the mirrors scattered around her
she has a gun in the hand which is not holding the cane
while gladys and paul are talking the film keeps on showing on the screen behind them but we do not understand the words from the film because paul and gladys
voices are louder
didnt you expect me
medium shot on the mirrors showing several reflections of paul
close shot on gladys face
while she is talking the camera pans away from her showing her reflection on a mirror
you made a lot of promises to me over the years
and then you decided to dump me for that young model
the camera keeps on panning showing another reflection of gladys
paul voice over i never led you on
gladys with a very harsh voice its late for excuses
medium shot on the mirrors showing several reflections of paul
none of you can prove anything
full shot of the screen showing arthur and his numerous reflections on the mirrors in the film
arthur everett sloane voice over from the film so youd be foolish to fire that gun

im aiming at you lover
arthur everett sloane voice over from the film of course killing you is killing myself
of course killing you is killing myself
arthur everett sloane voice over from the film its the same thing

she fired her gun twice medium shot on the many reflections of paul
he fires his gun twice
we hear noises of mirrors being broken by the gunshots both in the film and on the backstage itself
medium shot of gladys and one of her reflections
she turns around not being sure because of the mirrors of pauls exact location
medium shot of paul walking on the backstage
we still hears noises of mirrors being broken but we dont know if the noises come from the film or the backstage
medium shot of gladys and several of the reflections
medium shot of the floor of the backstage

paul enters from behind a mirror frame and falls on the floor
gladys reflection appears in several mirrors
she stops and looks at pauls body lying on the floor
medium close shot of larry entering the room
