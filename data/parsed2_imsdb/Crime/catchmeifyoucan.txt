written by jeff nathanson a simple game show set one long desk that houses four celebrity panelists a small pulpit with attached microphone for the host bud collyer who walks
through the curtain to the delight of the audience
bud bows and waves to the celebrities orson bean kitty carlisle tom poston and hello panel and welcome everyone to another exciting day on to tell the truth
lets get the show started
bright lights shine on the faces of three men who walk toward center stage
all thre n wear identical airline pilot uniforms each with m c ng blue blazers and caps
cont d gentleman please state your names
my name is frank abagnale jr
the pilot in the middle steps forward
my name is frank abagnale jr
the third pilot does the same
my name is frank abagnale jr
bud smiles grabs a piece of paper
panel listen to this one
he starts to read my name is frank abagnale jr and some people consider me the worlds greatest imposter
as bud reads the camera slowly pans the faces of the three bud collyer contd from to i successfully impersonated an airline pilot for pan am airlines and flew over
two million miles for free
during that time i was also the chief resident pediatrician at a georgia hospital the assistant attorney general for the state of louisiana and a professor of american history at
a prestigious university in france
by the time i was caught and sentenced to prison i had cashed over six million dollars in fraudulent checks in foreign countries and all fifty states and i did
it all before my th birthday
to this day i am the only teenager ever to have been placed on the fbi s most wanted list
my name is a abagna l e jr
warm applause as the three men walk behind a desk that faces the pa they all sit down at exactly the same time
bud colly contd okay panel you have ork cut out for you
kitty carl you have the first question
imposter number one how many years were you in prison
i served two years in france and five years in atlanta georgia
imposter number two i find all this very fascinating
who was it that finally caught you
a thin smile across his lips as he faces the panel his manicured hands out in front of him on the desk his back debbie zane straight in his chair
his cap pulled slightly forward on his head the way pilots like to wear them
a heavy rain falls on joe shape s who wears a black hat and holds a black umbrella as he bangs on the window of a small guardhouse in front
of a large gated prison
joe is sneezing as he holds up an identification card to the guard
joe shaye fbi
joe is walking down a long corridor inside the prison struggling to close his umbrella as he faces warden garren and two guards
i have orders see a prisoner named abagnale t e his statement and solicit a c n n so i can prepare for tomorrow tladition
joe takes a roll of cash out of h ocket casually slips the money to the warden
if i give you another twenty will you turn up the heat in here
warden garren is leading joe down a small isolated corridor just off the main floor
they pass cement doors with metal slide holes and numbers taped to the front
there are no bars or windows in this area and complete silence
garren stops at the last cell and opens the slide hole
dont pass him anything through the garren walks off and joe immediately starts to smile looking around for a long beat as he stares at the cell door
is the lady of the house at home
joe tries to control his excitement as he kneels down and looks through the metal slide hole
we see frank abagnale jr
his face partially hidden in the dim cell which gets its only light from a hanging bulb
frank is lying on the cement floor his back up against the far wall
he wears only a pair of underwear and clutches a torn blanket
jesus frank you look terrible
i heard about french prisons but this is positively barbaric
we hear a sound come fr dthe cell and then heavy coughing
jo e ye cont d that doesn t o d rr ood

and then tomorrow ill help you onto a plane clean you up and put you in a cell for the next twenty five years
debbie zane his face covered by a beard and matted black hair
frank closes his eyes and starts to cough

i cant breathe
joe listens to frank who is coughing so hard he starts to choke
dont start this shit frank
cant joe looks through the slot i e door but can only see faint images of frank rol the floor holding his joe shaye contd frank whats happening
damn it just calm down
somebody help me
frank is being dragged across the floor by warden garren and a second guard each holding an arm as they drag franks emaciated six foot frame through the halls
joe shaye jogs behind the guards
hes not breathing
i think he stopped breathing
a small empty room with four empty hospital beds
frank is lifted onto one of the beds his legs and arms flailing out to the sides kicking a thin curtain out from the wall
whats happening to him
garren and the guard quickly move toward a sink where they start to wash their hands
joe shaye contd what are you doing
washing off the lice
he cant breath
you have to call a doctor
the doctor p fnlsf in the morning
you cant just t him die
i have orders from the embassy
this man is going t tradited to the united state am holding you responsible if ant happens
suddenly garren looks past shaye eyeing the curtain that partially encloses franks bed
garren slowly moves toward the curtain pushes it open
drawing his gun and sprinting out the open door of the infirmary yelling in french for the guard to follow
joe shaye stands motionless staring down in horror at the empty bed
joe shaye contd oh shit
the prison alarm has sent every prisoner to the front of their cells where they see frank stumbling through the prison debbie zane
a thin smile on his lips as he tries to move his starved legs toward the main door
as frank makes his way past a row of cheering prisoners he trips and falls his body too weak to run as he starts to crawl across the prison floor
joe and garren easily catch up to him garren quickly kneeling down and holding his gun against franks head cocking the weapon
frank stops crawling rolls over on his back and smiles up at joe shaye
lets go home

ill send our typist up to give you a lesson
the electric striking ball of the typewriter is going over the same words again and again making them appear printed
the top of the phony check reads debbie zane
frank kneels over the bathtub looking down at a plastic model airplane
the small plane is soaking in the tub floating up side down in a pool of bubbles
the pan am logo is on the wing
we watch as a tweezer lifts the corner of the logo right off the plastic carefully slipping it off the wing so that the words pan american world airways hang
in mid air
meticulously placing the logo on top of the check he has just made
the words stick to the paper and he quickly takes the check and places it in the middle of a hotel bible
he sticks the bible under his bed the way a kid breaks in a new baseball glove
frank is still in uniform s walks past two male tellers and deliberately approac young female teller i was wondering if
bk i ptad cash this payroll check f frank takesthecheck out ofa phony pan am envelopeand hands it totheteller
thepan am logo on the check is crooked andoffcenter thetype blurred and almostillegible
you have beautiful eyes
the teller smiles at frank barely glances at the check as she opens her cash drawer
how would you like it
a small hobby shop in times square
frank sets fifteen boxes of pan am model airplanes on the counter
thats a lot of planes
i give them away at christmas to needy children
frank sits at a desk pulls a check from the carriage of an electric typewriter
the check is perfectly centered the pan am logo straight the lines and words looking thick and heavy as if they were printed
frank takes the check and sets it on the hotel bed where five hundred freshly made checks are sitting in neatly stacked piles
frank walks downstairs his uniform check in hand
the hotel manager rushes a to greet him
what can i do ou mr
im headed out to s morning and i need a little s money
im sorry sir we wont have any cash until the banks open in a hour
but im sure they can cash your check at the airport
they cash checks at the airport
frank wears his pilots uniform as he walks through the crowded airport holding a thick wad of cash
as he stuffs the money into his pockets he walks toward a sign that reads debbie zane
a giant warehouse filled with pilots co pilots flight attendants and baggage handlers
there is a cafeteria newsstand airline shop and shoe shine booth
frank sits down in one of the shoe shine chairs two twa pilots next to him
he stares at their i
badges which are laminated pictures clipped to the front of their jackets
the two pilots turn and look at frank

neatly displayed on the wall behind him
frank im paul mulligan head of security for pan american world airways
i understand youre writing a report about pan am and youd like to speak to a real live pilot
well youre in luck son
because i was one of the best
frank is following paul mulligan through a large gallery which shows the history of pan am in black and white pictures and detailed plastic models
what does it mean when one pilot says to another pilot what kind of equipment are you on
hes asking what kind of plane theyre flying
what about a d
badges ive seen pilots wear
e a pilot is requi of things with him at airline personnel b e similar to this pan aa wearing and his faa li mulligan pulls an old faa license
out of his wallet

a large office in new york city
a polaroid salesman has opened a sample book and is showing off page after page of frank wears a suit and tie as he sits across from the salesman examining
caribbean air will be expanding our routes next year to include most of the east coast

the ticket agent starts to la i i y ci i frank laughs with her
marci a cute year old eastern stewardess with short blonde hair and glasses stands at the front of the plane smiling at frank who holds out his pink boarding slip

frank is led into the cockpit by marci trying not to react to the intensity of the tiny space
he immediately looks around for the jump seat or any seat but sees nothing
frank this is captain oliver
thats john paxton the co pilot this is ron vega flight engineer
frank williams pan am
thanks for giving me a lift

frank continues to search for the jump seat the panic starting to show on his face as marci reaches her hand around to the back of the cockpit door and
pulls down the small there you go

frank quickly sits in the jump seat his hands shaking as he tries to strap himself in
a glass of milk please
close on frank inside the his hands gripping the sides of the jump seat his nd face clenched into a silent scream as the plane lift f banking left as
it shoots out over manhattan
frank is staring out the cockpit window in disbelief the way all kids do the first time they ride in a plane
frank walks through the cockpit door sees marci preparing drinks at the beverage station
hello dead head
enjoying your free ride
marci did you drop this
frank takes a small gold necklace out of his jacket pocket

frank is lying on top of marci losing his virginity not moving just staring down at her with a bizarre look on his face
the lights are low the radio is on

the parking lot is packed with cars
a light snow is falling as frank sr
walks out of the bar and buttons his jacket

frank turns to face his son who is standing in front of a red cadillac that still has the sticker in the window
the two men stare at each other for a long beat and then embrace in the middle of the lot

a slide projector the circular tray turning clockwise as an agent joe shaye stands at the front of the room addressing john doe is a paperhanger who started on the
during the last few weeks has developed a new form of check fraud which im calling the float
the slide doesnt change
joe shaye contd next slide please
the remote thing is broken
youll have to do it by hand
joe reaches in and turns the slide
joe shaye contd what hes doing is opening checking accounts all over the country then changing the micker ink routing numbers on the bottom of those checks
the faces of the five fbi agents looking bored as they all listen to joe having no idea what hes talking about
some of the agents are yawning while other are doodling at their desks
joe shaye contd this is a map of the branches of the u
the optical scanners at t bank read the numbers on the bott a check then ship the ch c i i i f
to the joe for those of with bank fraud wo telling us what the h talking about
the east coast branches are numbered seven through twelve the midwest four five and six
you mean to say that those numbers on the bottom of a check actually mean something
and if you change a number one to a number nine a check cashed in new york wont be sent to the east coast reserve but will be re routed
all the way to california
the bank wont know the check has bounced for two weeks which means debbie zane
joe shaye contd this guy can stay in one place rob the same banks over and over
the agents literally scratch their heads trying to follow
and this is why you called for an emergency briefing
because of a couple of bounced checks
laughter from the other agents as joe tries to smile
sean i was hoping to get some back up on this
you want my wife to help you
shes the one who balances the checkbook at home
fox sits in the im wearing a red nd high heels running through park and chasing these two puerto ricans with a suitcase filled with marijuana and i reach for
my radio to call for back up but the radio is stuck in my bra
joe turns up the volume on the radio keeps his eyes on the road as he drives
thats a funny story
people always laugh at that story

the unmarked fbi sedan pulls up to two story motel on the sunset strip
joe amdursky and fox walk into the motel office all in black suits and sunglasses
joe approaches the front desk of the motel where the owner stands in front of a fan
hes been here two weeks written lots of checks

joe shaye walks through the busy pool area of the motel passing a few flight attendants who are sitting by the tiny pool
joe makes his way up the main stairwell
joe walks through a fire door with his gun leading the way
at the end of the second floor hallway the do not disturb sign hanging off the door
joe slowly makes his way down the hall passing a maid wh s about to scream until he shows her his badge and vio y motions for her to hide
inside a room
joe creeps along the walyh s gun straight out his face covered in sweat
he free jow he hears a door creak his breathing labored as the s of room slowly swings open and frank walks into the ly u he wears a dark
brown suit and holds a black suitcase freeze
dont you move

frank slowly turns to face joe
the two men stare at each other for a beat relax buddy youre late
my name is johnson secret service
our boy just tried to climb out the window my partner has him cuffed in the alley downstairs
what are you talking about
keep your hands in the air
you think the fbi are the only ones tracking this guy
weve been following a paper trail for months almost had him in new york
would you mind taking that gun out of my face it makes me nervous
let me see some identification
take my whole wallet
frank throws his wallet to joe who catches it with his free hand but doesnt open it
you want my gun too
come over here and take my gun
frank opens his jacket but not wide enough for joe to see that hes not armed
are you gonna e that weapon
were supposed a on the same team
joe hesitates then slowly louw xs j
gun and holsters it
i got a little carried away
i didnt expect secret service on this
counterfeiting is our thing
i just wasnt expecting
dont worry about it
showing him the briefcase this is his typewriter
im gonna go lock it in my trunk
do me a favor and guard his room for a minute
frank starts moving toward the back stairwell
and yell down to my partner in the alley tell him im on my way
frank starts to walk down back stairwell
he looks back at joe who stands at the front of room
whats your name anyway
tough luck joe
five minutes earlier and you would have landed yourself a pretty good collar
frank starts walking down the stairs
i back to joe
frank stops slowly ty your wallet

frank walks downstairs opens the emergency exit that leads to a back alley
he looks both ways then starts to run toward joe shaye is guarding the entrance of room
hes standing tall almost at attention
after a beat he looks down at the wallet in his hand his mind starting to consider a single horrible thought
joe shaye is sitting in the office of special agent wilkes the office window facing out on the washington monument
ive cleared amdursky and fox in this john doe thing
it was my call all the way
sometimes we all get a little lost out there
no shame in being rusty
you want to talk about it
i made a mistake
forget about it
there are hundreds of john does out there
yeah but im gonna get this one
the worst thi a paperhanger can do is show is i saw him i heard his voice r s nothing for him to hide beiin ni just be careful j
uve got years in nobody bo r u down on the first floor
you ally wrote the book on bank d and thats good enough to make you f some day
theres no reason to put yourself in this type of position
what position is that
the position of being humiliated
joe stares at wilkes slowly stands and heads for the door
hes about to leave when he turns and looks back at wilkes
hey sean you want to hear a joke
debbie zane knock knock
a room service waiter opens a metal lid on a serving tray revealing a huge steak and french fries

willi d merry christmas
is looking through a giant print book tediously searching for a match
joe is alone in the fingerprint lab where a pathetic looking christmas tree sits in the corner of the room
the phone rings and joe quickly answers
this is shaye
who is this
johnson secret service
joe sits up at his desk grabs a pencil and paper
ive been trying to track you down for a couple of hours

i volunteered so that men with families could go home early
you were wearing a wedding ring in l
i thought maybe you had a family
ive never been married
you want to talk to me lets talk face to face
im at the waldorf astoria in manhattan
joe starts to write this down then suddenly stops himself
you think youre gonna get me again dont you
youd love for me to send twenty agents out on christmas eve to barge into that hotel break down doors so you can make a fool out of me again
joe im sorry if i made a fool out of you
goddamn it o t you feel sorry for me
the tru h knew it was you
maybe i didn he trigger but i knew
people only know wh r y iv tell them
then tell me something
how did you know i wouldnt look in the wallet
the same reason the yankees always win
nobody can keep their eyes off the pinstripes
the yankees win because they have mickey mantle
i have to go
im catching a flight in two hours
merry christmas joe
you didnt call to apologize did you john doe
what do you mean
youve got no one else to call
joe hangs up the phone
he cups his hands to his face then stares at a picture of his wife and daughter which sits on the desk in front of him
frank slowly hangs up the phone
he walks over to the chair in the room picks up his pilots cap and puts it on
frank stands across from a new accounts manager at a las you account balance will be three hundred dolls mr
and these are y r emporary checks
just take a deposit counter then fill in ou wish to the amounty i dont need to fill in my account number
at nevada savings and loan we treat our customers by name instead of by number
frank walks over and stares at the deposit slips
he grabs a thick stack and shoves them into his coat
when the deposit slips comes through the other side we see a nine digit account number printed on the bottom
frank sits on the edge of his las vegas hotel room hundreds of frank walks into the bank casually switches his stack of deposit slips with the ones on display
joe shaye uses a slide projector as he files a report in front of ten agents
im calling it the switch
the slide doesnt change
joe shaye contd joe shayei
i co john doe took two red and fifty deposit slips from nevada savings and encoded his account number on the bottom of each one
wait a second joe
those slips dont even have his name on them
the bank scanners read the micker ink before they read pen ink
so even though those deposit slips are filled out correctly each person who made a deposit that day was actually putting money into his account
how much did he get
forty six thousand four hundred and twelve dollars
it was the second largest bank robbery in the history of las vegas
paul mulligan sits across from frank eating lunch
frank is dressed in school clothes and holding a notebook
whats the fuel consumption of a in flight
kid im really not in the mood for this today
that damn skywayman is driving me crazy
there was another article
whos the sk an
mulligan hands frank f the new york times
some nut flying posing as a pan am has devoted a weekl frank stares down at the times h yes wide as he stares at the headline skywayman visits washington
elusive phony the skywayman
i keep telling them its not my problem
he doesnt fly on pan am planes he flies on everybody else
the damn paper is in love with this clown they call him the james bond of the sky
did you say james bond
frank is sitting in a movie theater watching goldfinger his eyes glued to the screen
hes eating a box of popcorn a big smile on his face as he stares up at sean connery
frank is wearing a three button black suit with a sweater vest and narrow black tie
hes looking at himself in a full length mirror with a salesman standing behind him
and youre sure this is the suit
s the same
one he wore in the movie
ill take three
now all you a is one of those little fore gny i ts cars he drives
the lab is packed with agent re searching for a fingerprint match
joe shaye i s head from a microscope rubs his eyes
joe i got something
joe rushes over to agent fox who is holding up two sets of i was looking through the wanted criminal file and there it was
look at that
joe takes the file from fox and opens it
holy shit a perfect match
they describe the skywayman as a thirty year old dark hair six feet same fucking guy
it doesnt make any sense
a thirty year old has to register for the draft which means his prints have to be here
maybe theres a reason he didnt register
he could have a wooden leg for all we know
maybe he was born in peru and hes not an american maybe hes not thirty
somebody call new york get a list of juvenile runaways from the nypd
paula abagnales home

paula gets off the couch and grabs her purse
im working part time now at the church

paula takes out her checkbook
so far its about two million dollars
lucy one of the bank tellers we met earlier sits in her office
joe shaye and the other agents open up the buckley school high school yearbook
on a page marked sophomores joe points to tiny black and white picture of frank wearing a coat and tie

he hurt his foot tonight
brenda grabs a chart starts to read it out loud
debbie zane f
applebaum fractured his ankle
doctor ashland is treating him in exam seven
brenda smiles covering her mouth
this is the emergency chart

how do you like those braces
brenda looks embarrassed as she stares at frank
i guess they okay
mine were bottoms
i h e e hhem
i still have my mouth qua you have really nice teeth
and you have a pretty smile
brenda tries not to smile shaking her head and covering her face
i think those braces look really good on you
brenda starts to blush as she continues to write her letter

a letter to ringo
what does it say
i cant tell you
