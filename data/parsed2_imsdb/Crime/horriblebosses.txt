written by michael markowitz april looking incredibly weary nick waters s enters his apartment in his business suit
he stumbles into he drops his briefcase strips off his jacket loosens his tie and collapses onto the bed like a dead man
pan over to the alarm clock which reads am
the alarm clock now reads am
it switches to and a blaring buzzer goes off
nick sits up in bed shuts off the buzzer and painfully forces himself out of bed
he hurries out of the bedroom passing the saddest deadest houseplant in history
nick opens his fridge to reveal a wasteland of moldy leftover containers and crusty condiments
the orange juice container he grabs is empty
he opens the freezer
it contains nothing but multiple boxes of jimmy deans breakfast bowl with bacon
he pops one in the microwave then glances over at a framed photo of a slightly younger nick kissing a smiling old woman on the cheek
the frame reads i y grandma
nick sighs sadly
nick sits on the toilet eating his breakfast bowl with a fork
he takes some toilet paper from the roll and wipes his mouth with it
nick showers while simultaneously brushing his teeth and shaving
he loses track and brushes his face with the toothbrush
nick hastily grabs work clothes from his messy drawers and closet
clearly no laundry has been done in a while
nick hurriedly buttons his shirt tucks it in and begins tying his tie as the elevator reaches the lobby
as he drives to work he dials a number and transfers it to speakerphone
hey jenna its nick
its five thirty in the morning nick
this is like the only time i have to make any personal calls
i just wanted to see if you felt like going out again because i had a great time with you on our last date
our last date was two weeks ago
you havent called me since
i know and thats my bad
ive been swamped at work yeah i remember
work was all you talked about when we went out
well im up for a promotion which will give me a lot more free time
listen im actually seeing someone
and even if i werent the last thing i need is some career obsessed guy complaining about work all the time
see you around nick
she hangs up
a soulless four story building in a drab office park
nick exits his car and runs full speed to the entrance
nick bursts through the doors and looks at his watch
he looks up at a security camera with a flashing red light indicating he is on tape
nick sits at his desk inputting information from a large pile of documents into a spreadsheet on his computer
the clock on his computer turns to am
nick jumps startled
he turns to see his boss dave harken s standing behind him
see you in my office
of the lobby security camera footage on a television
the time code at the bottom of the screen reads
we see nick looking up at the camera and silently mouthing the word fuck
the image freezes and we pull back to see harken holding the remote
nick stands across from him
heres my concern nick
youre a punctual guy
you understand the importance of getting to work on time
so that leaves me to wonder if there isnt something wrong with the internal clock in our security system
what do you think
i dont know mr
i might have been a minute late
two minutes according to this
so either youre a liar which i know youre not or our system is off by a full minute
and if thats the case i have no choice but to dismiss thomas our longtime security coordinator
okay i might have been two minutes late
theres an uncomfortable beat
then so you did lie
no i harken picks up the phone
who are you calling
im letting him go
okay i guess i lied
but i didnt mean to hangs up phone trust is everything in this office my friend
i know youve been working your tail off for that promotion but if i cant trust you how can i make you senior vp of sales
you can trust me
now you sound like my wife
he glances at a framed photo on his desk
of the hot bikini clad mrs
harken s standing on a beach
trust me honey
meanwhile shes making love to every guy in the neighborhood
oh im sure shes
loyal to how could you possibly know that
are you making love to my wife nick
im just kidding around
shes out of your league
harken has crossed to a credenza with several bottles of booze two glasses and an ice bucket
he begins to fill a glass with ice and scotch
would you like one
you think theres something wrong with a man enjoying a drink in the morning
id love a drink
harken hands him the drink he just poured
harken returns to his chair and sits
arent you having one
im not an alcoholic
well i only took it because i thought you were having one
you took a drink because you thought i was going to have one
that doesnt exactly sound like something a senior vp would do
well i what if you thought i was going to dip my balls in honey and shaved coconut
would you do that too
of course not
of course not
anyway weve moved up the date of the agm so youre gonna need to complete your due diligence by monday
youll probably need to be here all weekend
hey you want a promotion youve gotta earn it
lifes a marathon and you cant win a marathon without putting a few band aids on your nipples
nick gets up to go
nick turns back
thats year old scotch
i cant really pour it back into the bottle
nick unsure of what to do picks up the glass and gulps it down
that should carry you till lunch huh
a car pulls up outside the modest building
stacy cute s is dropping off dale stevens s who wears the scrubs of a dental hygienist
boy i have to get used to driving with this heavy ring on
i keep swerving to the left
you really like it
i love it
i feel like a queen
its tiny and yellowish
well youre my queen
i love you stacy
have a great day at work
dale exits the car
stacy drives off
dale steels himself for what lies ahead then goes inside
dale enters the waiting room passing a few patients
he grabs a mask and goggles from a supply room then heads
dale finds his boss dr
julia harris s sexy but with something a little off hovering over a patient mr
dale seems visibly uneasy
all right mr
anderton im going to give you the nitrous now and your root canal will be over before you know it
dale turns the valve on the tank and soon mr
andertons eyes roll back in his head
julia shuts the door picks up a drill and begins boring into the patients molar
loudly over the how are you today dale
you get a haircut
you ever watch that show gossip girl
i watched it last night
ill tell you lot of cuties on that program
number scraper please
dale hands her a tool
i fingered myself so hard to penn badgely i broke a nail
dale sighs and looks down at the unconscious mr
this obviously isnt the first time julia has spoken this way
id let that kid put it in my ass
bet hes packing a plus size sausage under those true religions
then looking up at probe
i need the probe
he hands her the tool
bet youre no shrimp in the cock department either huh dale
oh come on
you know i like to fool around
she lifts the patients limp hand and cups it over her breast
she smacks the lifeless hand and cackles with laughter
okay enough fun
lets get back to work
dale hands her the water jet tool
julia briefly sprays some water in the patients mouth then casually sprays down dales crotch with it
sorry im a squirter
studying his groin i think i can just make out our friend
looks like someone is circumcised
all right julia listen
you cant keep doing this
i know i know you have a shes not my girlfriend anymore
stacy and i got engaged last night
julias whole demeanor changes
she becomes deadly serious
youre actually going to marry that little dummy
i thought you said she was just a hole for your dick
thats a horrible thing to say
i never said that
anderton groans groggily
im very disappointed in you dale
then coldly scaler
shaken dale hands her the tool
a medium sized warehouse building in an industrial neighborhood
kurt gamble s good looking sits at his desk
unlike nick and dale kurt seems content in his workplace
a reasonably cute but by no means drop dead gorgeous ups girl approaches his desk with a package
can you sign for this please
what is this
this is one of those hidden camera shows isnt it
what do you mean
youre way too good looking to be a ups girl
what are you a model
whats gonna happen when i open this box
is something going to jump out at me
nothings gonna happen
im just a ups girl
you shut up
well then i need to take you out to dinner
because i want to be able to tell my friends that i took out the hottest ups girl in america
come on what do you say
she considers this briefly then scribbles her number on a post it note
see you then myrna
she heads off
kurt opens his datebook and scribbles ups girl in the tuesday slot
we see every night of the week is filled with appointments with other women barnes noble girl lauren
blonde chick and so on
kurt looks up at jack pellit s the kindly affectionate owner of the company
yeah just doing my part for the women of america
youre what we used to call a rapscallion
that sounds a lot more innocent than sex addict
walk with me kurt
the two of them head toward the exit
i wanted to talk to you about last quarters profits
i ran the numbers
were down by percent year to year
its this damn recession
what about cost cutting measures
well i know you dont want to cut no way
these people have worked their asses off for me
theres no reason they should suffer
kurt looks at his boss with admiration
theres a lot of love between these two
theres also the issue of our hazardous waste disposal
were paying a lot right now and the bolivians have come back with a very good offer
you know why its good
because theyll dump our chemicals in rivers pollute water supplies and hurt people
ive spent my life building this company
would you want the pellit name to be associated with something like that
no i wouldnt
as they pass the unisex rest room they see margie s and clearly pregnant looking uncomfortable as she waits to get in
everything okay margie
oh hi mr
ive just been waiting to get in there for a while now
whos in there
of course it is
then knocking on bobby
theres someone waiting
you almost done in there
after a long beat the door opens and out steps bobby pellit late s weasely looking sniffing a bit too much and rubbing his nose repeatedly
theres something unnaturally energetic about him
what the fuck
a guy cant get any privacy in this place
its all yours margie
margie quickly slips into the rest room and shuts the door
you know bobby you seem to be spending more time in that bathroom than at your desk these days
well then youre fucking stupid dad
because thats clearly not true
all i ask is that you do your part around here son
i do my part
i do other peoples parts
but you just like to ride my ass because im your son
i dont see you screaming at dickskin here
thats because kurt does his work and does it well
you could take a lesson from him
the only thing id take a lesson from him on is being gay
and i wouldnt take that lesson because i dont want to be gay
come on kurt
kurt follows after jack
yeah thats what i thought
jack and kurt pass a receptionist desk and go out into kurt walks jack to his cadillac
tell me something kurt
are you happy here
its the best job in the world
im glad to hear you say that
im rewriting my will tonight and theres going to be a special place for you in there
he gives kurt a hug like a doting father then climbs into his car
as jack pulls out and begins driving across the parking lot kurt waves
suddenly the cars horn begins to honk in a constant blare
kurt lowers his hand as the car veers off the pavement slowly cruising into a tree where it stops abruptly the horn still honking
a bewildered kurt runs toward the car as we kurt sits at a table looking depressed
he died instantly
they say his heart burst in his chest like a water balloon
pan to reveal kurt is sitting with dale who looks just as dejected
he was like a dad to you
i loved him
and i loved working for him
and now his idiot son is gonna be in charge
you know how many times ive caught him doing blow at work
pan further to reveal nick sitting beside dale
you were the only one of us who didnt totally hate his job
did i tell you harken tricked me into having a drink at eight oclock this morning
the guys the devil
i thought he was giving you a promotion
and hes got to do it before the general meeting next week
well at least your boss doesnt sexually harass you
im telling you shes out of control
its a full on hostile work environment
shes a woman who wants to have sex with you
how bad can it be
today she sprayed my crotch with water so she could see the outline of my wiener
why dont you just fuck her
congratulations by the way
theres gotta be other dental hygienist jobs out there
i cant apply for another job remember
because youd have to tell them youre a child molester
hes not a child molester
he just took his dick out in a playground
it was nighttime and i was peeing
and its bullshit that i got put on the registered sex offender list for that
it worked out
julia probably hired you because shes a sexual deviant herself
why would they put a playground next to a bar anyway
a semi cute girl walks past
well i should go see if that girl wants to bone
kurt groans as he pulls himself out of the booth
i thought you were all broken up about your boss dying
this is how i grieve okay
kurt heads off after the girl
he must be grieving all the time
nick sits alongside five other co workers at a conference table
harkens chair at the head is empty
nick pours himself some water from a glass pitcher on the table
he did say ten oclock right
do you know what this is about
it just said staff meeting on the memo
funny how he gets all over me if im a minute late but he makes us wait fifteen
you were two minutes late nick
nick jumps as harken enters
and i didnt know i had to punch a clock with you
of course you dont
im sorry im going to attribute this to your drinking problem
i dont have a with a smile to the lets get started
nicks eyes narrow
suddenly he grabs the heavy glass pitcher from the table and shatters it against harkens face
shards of glass fly everywhere as harken falls from his chair onto the floor
harken is fine
nick is as we left him
okay have we figured out our best sales distribution plan for the new model year handsets
nicks co workers bury their heads in their notes
nick tensely raises his hand
i simulated a number of sales cycles factoring in likely end users point of sale limitations and specific demographic variables
and in my opinion an open plan selling process in our top markets along with targeted upgrade offers to existing customers promises the greatest yield
is he impressed
thank you nick
did everyone see how he did that
yes he may be a pathological liar and have a crippling drinking problem but when the chips are down nick has what it takes
which brings us to our next order of business
ive decided who i want as our new senior vp of sales
hes sitting right here among you
everyone turns to look at nick
everyones head snaps back to harken
ive decided to absorb the responsibilities of the senior vp position into my own
i realized if you want something done right you do it yourself
so im going to be knocking down the wall between my office and what wouldve been the senior vps to create a single enormous office
however as a cost cutting measure i will only be taking of the additional salary im entitled to
its called self sacrifice people
learn from this
harken heads out
nick hurries to catch up with harken
harken can i speak to you
what is it
youve been hinting for months that i was in line for that promotion
and look how hard youve worked
so youve just been lying to me
were all on the same team here nick
were all trying to find lorenzos oil before its too late for little lorenzo
besides im the one whos taking on a lot more work
barely keeping it last month you kept me working so late i didnt get to say goodbye to gam gam
i told you i needed to see her but you said id be fired if i left early
she died before i could get to the hospital
she taught me how to swim oh my god
i had no idea
that you called your grandmother gam gam
i dont mean to laugh but thats adorable
off nicks outraged look nick im sorry you didnt get to say bye bye to gam gam
i make you work late because youre an invaluable part of this operation
and i need you in your current position
ive been in that position for eight years now
why would i stay here after being treated like this
because i will see to it that no one else in our industry will hire you
anyone who interviews you will want my letter of recommendation
and im prepared to tell them that you are a dishonest insubordinate drunk
but thats not true
you cant do this
harken gets directly in nicks face speaking softly but intensely
let me make this clear you weak little fuck
i own you
youre my bitch
dont make the mistake of thinking you have free will
because i can crush you any time i like
stepping back settle in friend
youre here for the long haul
harken slaps him hard on the back and continues on his way leaving a stunned nick
kurt somberly heads to his desk
hes wearing a dark suit
what the fuck
kurt sees bobby pellit standing in the doorway of what was jacks office
youre three hours late
whats the deal
i was at your fathers funeral
maybe that excuse wouldve flown when my dad was here but im in charge now
that excuse wouldnt have made any sense when your dad was here
in my office
he notices that the jack pellit nameplate has been partially taped over with the name bobby scribbled in magic marker
bobby quickly slips a small mirror and rolled up dollar bill into a drawer
kurt sees bobby has tossed most of jacks mementos achievement awards and photos with luminaries in the trash
ive been looking over the books
youre the accountant
tell me why this company is in the crapper
its not in the crapper
its a recession
but were still profitable
look i know you and my dad were pals
frankly i always thought it was weird and gay and i never understood why my dad thought you were so great
but it doesnt matter now because hes in the ground and im your boss
and theres gonna be some changes around here
first of all
pointing to a what is this envirotech waste management shit that were paying so much for
your father made the decision to pay a little more to dispose of our chemical waste responsibly
yeah fuck that
weve got an offer from bolivia to dump the stuff for a third the cost
but that would endanger thousands of local residents
so some jungle tribesmen get cancer
boo friggin hoo
theyre not tribesmen
its a look bobby your dad told me very clearly hed die before hed save money by hurting people
well then were right on schedule arent we
kurts eyes narrow
he reaches into the trash can and grabs one of jacks discarded achievement trophies and plunges its pointy end deep into pellits chest impaling him in his chair
kurt sits across from an unharmed pellit
oh and we also need to trim the fat around here
snapping out of it what do you mean
i want you to fire the fat people
theyre slow and lazy and they make me sad to look at
start with large marge
angle on margie at her desk
margies not fat
im not firing her
then fire professor xavier over there
angle on a balding middle aged man in a wheelchair hank who sits at a desk near margies
he creeps me out
rolling around in that weird little chair of his
im not firing anyone
its like you dont care about this company at all
you think when i was a kid i dreamed of running a fucking chemical company
i dreamed of retiring
of being fed tropical fruit on a beach by a model while she blows me
and as soon as i squeeze all the profit out of this place thats exactly what im gonna do
so heres the deal
you either fire the fatty or the cripple or i fire both of them
kurt sighs as he looks from margie to hank and back
at last he gathers his resolve and crosses to hanks desk
from a respectful distance we watch as kurt breaks the news to hank who reacts with sad resignation
kurt turns to see pellit standing directly beside him
loudly to the room everyone can i have your attention please
ive just learned that kurt has fired our dear friend hank here
i want you to know that i am as surprised and angry about this as you are
what are you
this is entirely an accounting department decision
my hands are tied
then to kurt you are one heartless bastard gamble
pellit heads off
hank glares at kurt
look hank this was not my fuck you kurt
hank wheels away leaving kurt to face the angry looks of his co workers
dale dressed for work knocks on julias office door
you wanted to see he looks up to find julia sitting at her desk in nothing but an unbuttoned white lab coat
have a seat dale
do i have to
he sits then immediately stands again
look julia this is ridiculous holding up hand i know what youre going to say and thats exactly what i want to talk to you about
yes i like to joke around at work
and sometimes i might cross the line a bit
but the last thing i want to do is make you uncomfortable
thats unprofessional and i pride myself on being a professional
she leans back in her chair and puts her hands behind her head revealing even more of her body
so from now on i want you to tell me when and if i cross the line
youre naked julia
im not naked
you cant even see my pussy
okay right there
just saying pussy to me
thats over the line
thats over the line
youre starting to sound like a little faggot dale
naked pussy faggot
all over the line
and probably okay lets not start talking about illegal mr
pees on young boys
it was an empty playground
in the middle of the night
that little boy must have been terrified
julia stands and moves uncomfortably close to dale
he tries not to stare at her breasts
lets cut to the chase
youre engaged now
and i respect the institution of marriage too much to violate it
thats why you need to fuck me well before the wedding
because the closer it gets the less ladylike im going to feel about this whole thing
im not going to sleep with you julia
well see about that
then suddenly startled dale hurries out of the office
nick dale and kurt sit miserably over their drinks
theyve all had a few
i feel like a total sucker
harken was never planning on promoting me
that coked out douchebag is gonna destroy pellit chemicals
she stood there with her breasts right in my face
nick and kurt turn to dale
you know yours just doesnt sound that bad
why dont you guys quit
its not like youre sex offenders
i mean im young
i could go back to school change fields
in the b
a guy has noticed them
he heads over
why should i care about protecting pellits name when his own son doesnt
theres a million jobs out there
the world is your oyster
well well if it isnt the three musketeers nick kurt and dale
still hanging out like high school huh
i dont believe it
i heard you moved to new york to work at lehman brothers or something
hired me right out of yale
so what are you doing back here
dont you read the papers
they shut us down
ive been looking for work for the last two years
its crazy out here
i cant even get a job waiting tables
you were voted most likely to succeed
everyone thought you were set
everyone including me
id murder those lehman brothers if i could
line them up put one bullet through their three heads
its just not fair
i was making high six figures
now i cant even afford this drink
holds up glass seriously you think you guys can help me out at all
the three guys exchange uncomfortable looks as they reach for their wallets
heres a few bucks kenny
okay yknow thats not really gonna do it for me
looking around ill tell you what
what if i give you guys handjobs
we can do it in the bathroom right here
ill do the three of you for a hundred
youre gay now
no im not gay
they look skeptical
im the opposite of gay
they guys look at each other with eyebrows raised
nick mouths opposite
handjobs for the three musketeers
lets do this
the bartender spots kenny and points at him
i thought i told you to stay out of here
gotta go guys
call me if you change your minds
im at my moms
he hurries out
theres a silent beat as the guys process what theyve just witnessed
the three guys are walking home all mildly buzzed
so i guess were just gonna be miserable for the rest of our lives
what do you mean
what options do we have
we can quit our jobs and turn into kenny
or keep our jobs and turn into sad ball less losers who spend their days dreaming of ways to kill their bosses
theres a beat as nick regards kurt
you do that too
its the only thing that keeps us from going totally bat shit
the other day i imagined shoving one of those jugs from the water cooler in harkens mouth and making him drink until his bladder explodes
thats so funny
i had the same idea for pellit
only using gasoline instead of water
and his ass instead of his mouth
you guys are sick
whats sick about it
its just a way to let off steam
its not like were actually going to kill our bosses
they continue walking
after a beat
you have to admit though our lives would be a lot better if our bosses were dead
well of course
its the one thing that keeps me from being happy
theres another beat
lets just consider this for one second
killing our bosses
im just being hypothetical here
laughing it off yeah right
well its not like theyre gonna live forever
these pieces of shit are going to die someday
wed just be accelerating that natural process
shut up kurt
yeah shut up kurt
frankly i dont see any reason not to do it
well first of all killing someone is illegal and immoral it may be illegal but im not sure its immoral
sometimes one evil person has to die for the greater good of the community
if bobby pellit has his way hundreds maybe thousands of innocent bolivians will suffer
it would actually be immoral not to kill him
nick begins to warm to the idea
i didnt get to say goodbye to gam gam because of harken
who knows how many other gam gams have died alone
i cant believe you guys are actually talking about this
i dont care how bad our bosses are
were not murderers
no were not dale
were just trying to live our lives
but what are we supposed to do when someone makes it impossible for us to live our lives
do we just bend over and take it up the ass forever
no we do not
what you guys are talking about is wrong and you know it
julias ruining your life
shes not ruining my life
if anythings ruining my life its you guys and your drunk bullshit
if its bullshit dale then how come we all want to do it so much
they reach the corner where they part ways
i dont want to do it
and when you sober up neither will you
were not killing anyone
dale heads off
i was just being hypothetical
yeah me too
off their ambivalent looks dale is organizing some equipment when a pair of womans hands suddenly cover his eyes
im really not in the mood for this now he turns and reacts as he sees its not julia but his fiancee stacy
not in the mood for what
what are you doing here
julia appears in her office doorway
i invited her
she called and said now that were engaged she wanted to offer me free dental work
and you know ive had that loose filling for a while
its so sweet of you julia
its my pleasure
youre part of the family now
i dont know if this is a good idea
we dont want to take advantage of julia
dale theres nothing you could do that would be taking advantage of me
then to stacy now what do you say we pump you full of gas
julia leads stacy into the exam room
dale cuts them off
wait no gas
she doesnt need to be out
what are you talking about dale
you know im not good with drills
you dont want your fiancee to suffer do you
off dales defeated look stacy lies on the chair with the nitrous mask over her nose
julia and dale stand beside her
and shes out
immediately julia pounces on dale feverishly trying to unbuckle his belt
stop it what are you
youre gonna give me that dong dale
stacy groans softly
dale pushes julia away
i knew you only brought her in here to mess with me
lets have sex on top of her
lets use her like a bed
julia begins to clamber up onto stacys supine body
dale pulls her off
all right thats it julia
this is over
youre out of your mind
he goes to turn off the gas but before he can ill tell her you fucked me
if you dont fuck me ill tell her you fucked me
tell her whatever you want
shed never believe you
julia opens a nearby drawer and tosses an envelope onto stacys chest
she already knows youre a sex offender
and once she sees these i think shell believe me
what is that
you remember your first week here when i replaced the crown on your second bicuspid
i took a few snapshots of the procedure
for my files
dale lunges at the envelope and pulls out the photos
dale lies on the dentist chair his eyes open and his hands behind his head with julia at his crotch apparently fellating him
julia now nude straddles dale who is naked from the waist down on the chair
she holds one arm in the air like a rodeo cowboy
julia is on the floor her legs splayed while dale lies limply on top of her
julia is on all fours
dale is limply draped over her back apparently doing her doggy style
you did all this while i was unconscious
how did you make it look like i was awake
taped your eyes open
this is rape
you raped me
dont get all dramatic
your dick wasnt hard
but it will be next time
or else stacy here gets a look at my photo album
she holds up the packet of photos
now lets repair this patients filling shall we
dale gapes at her dumbstruck
kurt and nick are playing a videogame as dale bursts through the front door
lets kill the bitch
they need to die
nick and kurt exchange a look
we were drunk last night man
and didnt you say killing was wrong
that was before julia tried to fuck me on top of my fiancees unconscious body
i say we kill them all
are you guys in or out
i was in last night
they both turn to nick who is uncertain
kurt spots the photo of nick with his grandmother and grabs it off the wall
look at her
look at bubby
look at gam gam
getting a smooch from her favorite grandson
little does she know that shell never get to say goodbye to him
because his shithead boss wouldnt let him leave
what would gam gam want you to do
probably not kill him
this isnt about gam gam
this is about you
what do you want nick
i want him to die
okay im in
lets do this
how do we do this
i was thinking about that on my way over
stacy and i watch a lot of law order and theres a ton of ways criminals mess up
things wed never think of
they leave behind clothing fibers bullet casings hair skin cells skin cells
i cant even keep track of my keys
and thats why we need a professional
what are you talking about a hitman
you know thats not bad
i mean we dont clean our own apartments right
we hire someone to clean them for us
maybe you do moneybags
but where are we supposed to find a hitman
thats the only problem
i have no idea
theres a beat
kurts eyes light up
meet at my place tomorrow after work
and make sure youre not followed
why would anyone follow us
i dont know
people get followed
just meet me at my place
kurt opens the door on nick and dale
the decor of kurts place is best described as a middle income bachelor pad
the guy should be here pretty soon
you actually found someone
it was as easy as buying a used futon
he points to his computer
on the screen is a listing craigslist
you found a hitman on craigslist
but they dont post it as hitman
that would be stupid
they use code words like liquidation pest control wet work
check it out
this is our guy
nick reads the listing
skilled professional with years of experience in domestic and international wet work
fast and discreet
no children or political figures
this is so dangerous
what if hes a narc
call him back and cancel
its too late
hes on his way
what do we do if this guy gets here and he asks for so much money that we cant afford him and he gets mad and kills all of us
i dont think hed stay in business long if he killed everyone who couldnt afford him
looking out window guys
i think this is him
the others hurry to look
we see a black mercedes slk pull up
a distinguished looking man in a well tailored suit steps out
he wears sunglasses and carries a briefcase
this guys legit
i bet that briefcase has one of those guns you have to screw together
all right lets just be professional here
we dont want to seem all giddy
a knock at the door
hows my hair
it doesnt matter
kurt opens the door on the man who looks even smoother up close
is one of you kurt
whispering to nick oh my god hes like james bond
to the man yes hi im kurt
please come in
are all three of you participating in this
yes we are
now before we go any further i need to know if there are any hidden recording devices in this room
i will find out if there are
we definitely dont want to record this sir
then lets get started
he walks to the middle of the living room opens his briefcase and takes out a plastic tarp which he proceeds to unfurl over the carpet
whats that for
for the mess
we dont want you to kill us
oh my god
i knew it
what are you talking about
the guys exchange a confused look
your ad said you do wet work
i urinate on other men for money
why do you think my ad was in the men seeking men section
you were looking in men seeking men
were men seeking a man arent we
you are such a moron
so youre telling me i drove all the way to the valley and no one wants to be pissed on
please dont kill us
i dont kill people
then sighing can i use your rest room
ive stored up rather a large amount of pee for this
its right through there
the man heads off
after a beat good thing i didnt call the guy who was offering to do dirty work
nick is in the passenger seat
dale in back
all right ill take the blame for that one
thats big of you
im going to make it up to you
i figured out a much better way to find a contract killer
kurt reaches up and pushes a button on the rear view mirror
a male voice comes over the speaker
gamble thank you for contacting on star oh come on
this is your plan
my name is gregory
how can i be of service this evening
gregory i need you to direct me to the most dangerous bar in los angeles
we need to find the bar with the most scumbags lowlifes and hardcore shitheads
can you help us out
im afraid our listings are not organized by danger sir
i do see there is a bennigans three blocks from your current okay gregory
while im sure there are plenty of shitheads there theyre not the kind of shitheads we need
i can direct you to the neighborhood with the greatest number of car jackings in your area
now were talking
very good sir
you may wish to lock your doors
kurt and the others lock their doors
kurts car drives down a depressed looking block
the guys are still chatting with gregory
so do you like living in bangalore
its not bad
is that your real name
my real name is atmanand
how did you get gregory from that
gregory was assigned to me by on star
why dont they let you use your real name
many americans find our real names off putting
actually i do find atmanand a little off putting
you have arrived at your destination sir
thank you gregory
kurts car pulls up on a grimy looking south central street and stops in front of a dingy bar
the guys get out and look around warily
this must be the place
arent you worried about your car
nah gregorys watching it
you really think were gonna find a hitman in there
i think were gonna have a hard time deciding between all the hitmen in there
trust me these are the lowest of the low
the three guys enter the squalid smoky place
the room is full of surly looking patrons none of them white
people turn to stare
oh real nice kurt
way to be racist
this isnt a race thing
we need a criminal and this neighborhood is where they live
im not saying thats because there are a lot of black people here
thats the fault of our society that discriminates and disenfranchises them
you said they were the lowest of the low
i was speaking socio economically
so what do we do now
yell out anyone here kill people for money
let me handle this
they each take a seat at the bar where a no nonsense bartender walks over to them
how you doing
listen does anyone here kill people for money
an intense looking guy on the next stool notices them
the fuck did you just say
dont get me wrong
this isnt about race
our society discriminates and disenfranchises head in hands oh my god
im a small business owner
who are you calling disenfranchised
i didnt mean you in particular
you mean all black people
maybe we should go
you could do that
or i could take the aluminum baseball bat im holding in my right hand and disenfranchise your teeth from your mouth
i vote we go
the three stand and head for the door
okay were going
im sorry if i offended you
it was never my oh shit please shut up
the guys come out onto the sidewalk
this is ridiculous
were never gonna find someone to do this for us
they turn to see cocksucker jones s the guy who was sitting next to them at the bar
i think i can help you boys
he gestures for them to follow him into the alley beside the bar
kurt and nick move to follow
oh were just gonna follow him into that alley
cocksucker jones leans in to the three guys
i heard youre looking for someone to take care of some business for you
yes we are
are you a
putting out his cocksucker jones
unsure whether to take his hand excuse me
thats my name
your first name is cocksucker
and my last names jones
you got a problem with that
its just interesting
thats the name on your birth certificate
its a nickname
my real name is dean
like dean jones
the actor from herbie the love bug
quietly to dale i dont think he knows who dean jones is
i know who dean jones is bitch
i cant walk around here with that kind of faggy cracker name
so you chose cocksucker
nobody fucks with a cocksucker
cocksucker is the toughest name there is
i considered motherfucker
but in the end i thought cocksucker jones sounded more badass than motherfucker jones
okay heres the thing we each work for a boss that we need to get rid of
is that something you might be able to help us with
assuming youve got the cheese
weve got cheese
how much cheese are we talking
for three hits
thats gonna run you thirty large
thats a lot of cheese
we dont have that much cheese
isnt there any kind of discount because were buying three at once
like buy two get one free
this aint the motherfucking cold stone creamery
its thirty large or nothing
theres no way we can pay that
thats a lot more reasonable
and that would be for all three cocksucker
okay meet me back here tomorrow night with the cash
ill take care of the rest
should we bring the bills in any kind of special denominations
no just whatever
and do you want it in any particular container like a shoebox
or a paper bag
i read an article that plastic is actually better for the environment than paper
fuck the environment
just put that shit in a briefcase
come on guys
they turn to go when dale turns back
should we deduct the cost of the briefcase
i mean assuming we dont get the case back
were not getting the case back right
cocksucker glares at him
well thats like an extra eighty bucks
only seems fair that we should take that out of your end
well cover the briefcase dale
then lets get a cheap one
it doesnt have to be real leather
then to cocksucker are you cool with faux
kurt grabs dale by the shoulder and hustles him to the car
music cue frank sinatras forget your troubles come on get happy dale kurt and nick each take a turn at an atm machine withdrawing the maximum amount they can
nick at his desk at work
he looks over his cubicle wall and his eyes narrow as he sees harken directing a workman who stencils the words senior vice president of sales below where it already
another workman uses a sledgehammer on the wall of the office
nick grins malevolently
kurt is at his desk in the chemical company
he looks up to see bobby pellit open his office door and lead out two obvious hookers
pellit has white powder around his nostrils
he spots kurt watching him and he sneers back
kurt smiles devilishly
close on dale as he places tooth x rays into plastic contact sheets
pull back to reveal julia is licking his neck while tweaking his nipples through his scrubs
in contrast to earlier dale appears to be unfazed and almost amused by julias antics
cocksucker jones holds an open briefcase thats empty but for a single stack of taped together dollar bills
looks like its all here
turns out we didnt really need the briefcase after all
couldve just used a manila envelope
shut up dale
so cocksucker how long do you think itll be before youve
taken care of business
heres the thing
i just got out of doing a dime for some pretty ugly shit and im still on probation
theyre watching me
so if i step out of line i go right back inside
you told us you could take care of it
and im gonna
im gonna be your professional advisor
think of me as your murder consultant
we dont want a murder consultant
we want a murderer
i knew we were getting ripped off
this isnt what we talked about
can we just get our money back please
then well be on our way
sorry no refunds
thats five thousand dollars
you think were just gonna walk away and let you keep that
getting in his face i think youre forgetting who youre talking to
cocksucker pulls back the lower edge of his jacket to reveal what appears to be the holster of a gun
we dont want any trouble
now either i give you the advice you paid for or you can walk away with nothing
up to you
look the whole reason we came to you is because we dont have the experience to do it ourselves
most killers are first timers
look the key to a good murder is making it look like an accident
gas leak brakes failing suicide that sort of thing
if you do it right you wont even have to be there when it goes down
that makes sense
but how would we fake three accidents
you need to stalk your prey track their movements get to know them inside and out
where do they go
what do they eat for breakfast
whore they fucking
youre talking about surveillance and recon
but making it look like an accident wont be enough if the pigs can pin a motive on you
well we all have obvious motives for killing our bosses
so why dont you kill each others bosses
hey thats a good idea
like hitchcocks strangers on a train
the danny devito movie
yes the famous alfred hitchcock danny devito movie
youre thinking of throw mama from the train
but its actually the same idea
if we kill each others bosses theres no link to us
thats pretty good
thats what youre paying me for
now aint that worth five grand
the guys all ad lib nos
yeah well too fucking bad
nick is poring over a stack of documents when his phone rings
kurt and dale wait in the car outside of nicks office
you ready for a little recon
i just need to get harken to let me leave early
whats the difference
hes not going to be your boss much longer
if i get fired before we kill harken thisll all have been for nothing
ill just be an out of work murderer
ill be down in three minutes
he hangs up then peers over his cubicle wall to see harken talking to another employee nearby
nick takes a breath leans over his garbage pail and sticks a commtronix pen down his throat
at the sound of nicks loud wretching harken looks over to see him puking into the trash pail
what in gods name
ive been fighting this bug all day
ill just get back to work nick wipes his mouth and turns pathetically back to his desk
i dont want you getting everyone else sick
thank you mr
nick grabs his jacket and moves to go
take your work with you
have it on my desk at six am
nick barely conceals his contempt as he picks up the stack of papers and heads out
kurts car pulls up slowly and parks
kurt dale and nick slump down in their seats
okay boys as soon as pellit makes a move we tail him
it is on now
oh its on
they watch the house with steely determination
the guys are bored out of their minds barely awake
dale nibbles on a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in a plastic bag
ugghhhhh i cant believe how much this sucks
i dont get it
on tv surveillance always looks so great
theyve got their cups of coffee
their sunflower seeds
they talk about their lives
and then right when they reveal something really intimate the perp appears and they spring into action
a long silent pause as they watch the house
are we even sure hes home
they exchange looks
opening his door lets go check it out
they get out of the car
dale pockets his sandwich
the three guys creep around pellits patio peeking in doors and windows
finally i dont see him
kurt is about to try a window when dale stops him
what are you doing
were not gonna get intel standing on his lawn
we have to go in
what about fingerprints
we dont have gloves
here do this
kurt pulls his shirt sleeves down over his hands
dale does the same
nick who wears a t shirt tucks his hands inside the bottom of the shirt
with some difficulty kurt slides open the window
here we go
the three of them manage to wriggle through the window
its not graceful dales foot gets caught on the sill causing him to tumble on top of nick and kurt
at last all three are inside
dale keep an eye out
let us know if pellits coming
wait i dont know what he looks like
it doesnt matter
just tell us if anyone comes
they take in pellits living room
theres a leather sofa a inch plasma and enormous speakers
on the wall are framed ed hardy posters depicting dragons and half naked girls
this guys a bigger douchebag than me
okay lets split up
look for any intel we can use on him
what kind of intel
i dont know
i guess well know it when we see it
kurt heads upstairs while dale and nick look around the living room
does this count as intel
nick looks over to see dale holding in his sleeve covered hands an open wooden box filled with white powder
holy shit thats a lot of blow
god this must be worth like ten thousand oh shit
suddenly the box slips out of dales hands
it hits the floor sending a cascade of cocaine all over the rug
what the fuck
sorry my sleeves were slippery
weve got to get that back in the box
ive got it
he kneels and begins trying to scoop up the coke in his hands
its an impossible task
kurt looks around the room
he doesnt see anything useful so he heads into he flips on the light
his eyes land on pellits toothbrush
he grins slyly
dale is still on his knees scooping up coke as nick returns from the kitchen cradling a dustbuster in his t shirt
let me try this
struggling with his hands in his t shirt nick vacuums up the cocaine from the rug
when hes finished he pops open the vacuums waste receptacle and dumps the contents back in the wooden box
which is now filled not only with cocaine but bits of hair dust bunnies food and other crap
i guess we shouldve emptied the dustbuster before we used it
just below frame kurt removes pellits toothbrush from his ass and returns it to its holder careful to keep his hands covered with his sleeves
hes about to go when he notices a bar of neutrogena face soap beside the sink
he looks around deviously
dale and nick are doing their best to pick the crap out of pellits cocaine
hey look theres a piece of cereal in here
cant tell if thats a corn flake or a frosted flake
kurt comes down the stairs
okay my work upstairs is done
you guys ready to split
kurt pulls away from the curb
we need to be better prepared
that was totally dangerous and a complete waste of time
not a complete waste
he pulls a blackberry out of his pocket
dont tell me
you stole that from pellits house
its got his calendar and his contacts
this is what recons all about
nobody said wed be stealing
shall we pay a little visit to your boss nick
i guess so
but lets make a stop first
nick emerges from the store with a plastic bag and gets into kurts car
what did you need to get
nick holds up a box of latex gloves
no more sleeve gloves
oh man you shouldve asked me
ive got a whole box of those in my bedside table
off their grossed dont judge me
take a right up here
harkens place is about a mile away
they drive for a beat
this is kinda i dont know
a little smile yeah
i guess were really doing this now huh
i guess so
a two story house with a tidy yard
kurts car pulls up
kurt and nick begin pulling on their gloves
can i have a pair
you know last time with the three of us it got a little
what if kurt and i go in and you stay here and watch out for harken
okay again i dont know what he looks like
if anyone approaches the house assume its him and give us a signal
ill honk the horn six times
maybe something a little more subtle
honk the horn four times
how about you just honk once
people honk once all the time
youll be running in and out of the house
nick and kurt get out of the car
after a beat dale remembers his sandwich and pulls it out of his pocket
kurt and nick sneak up to the front porch which is camouflaged by shrubs
they peek inside
looks like the coast is clear
kurt tries the windows
guess well have to break in the old fashioned way
kurt looks around and spots a small rock beside the porch
he picks it up and winds back to throw it at the window
but its too late
kurt has released the rock
it hits the window but instead of breaking the glass the rock itself breaks into two pieces
i broke the rock
no its one of those hide a key things
nick shows kurt a key concealed in one half of the fake rock
he grabs it and inserts it into the front door lock
the guys tiptoe in whispering and tense
the place is tastefully decorated with attractive furniture and modern art
there is a vase of flowers on a table
this is not how i pictured his place
for all we know hes got a closet full of skin suits
a cat springs out of nowhere startling them then runs off
lets check upstairs
they head up
dale is finishing the last of his peanut butter sandwich
he checks the rearview mirror
no sign of anyone
singing a la cher do you believe in love after love i can feel something inside me say i really dont think youre strong enough now
just as kurt and nick enter the cat suddenly jumps out from behind the door startling them again
god damn it
how many cats do they have
i think that was the same one
kurt notices a framed wedding photo on the dresser of harken and mrs
id like to cover her in cock yogurt
you want to cover every woman in
did you say cock yogurt
yet again kurt and nick jump as the cat leaps out of hiding with a yowl then runs off
if hes so scared of us why doesnt he just leave us alone
dale plays a bowling game on his cell phone
a breeze blows through the open windows of the car catching the plastic bag from dales sandwich and carrying it out the window
just then harken in running attire comes jogging up the street
his eye is caught by the plastic bag falling from the car window onto the street
he stops and angrily picks up the bag
dale surprised turns to the window
you want to tell me why youre littering on my street
oh im sorry that blew out the window
i wasnt littering
i dont care if it blew out of your twat
now get your fucking chevy cavalier the hell off my block
sir theres no need to be hostile
you want to see hostile
how about i go in the house and get my suddenly harken begins to choke and his face grows increasingly red
get your what
with one hand harken grabs his throat and with the other he looks at the plastic bag hes holding
it was a peanut butter sandwich
harken collapses to his knees
his face is turning blue now
dale quickly steps out of the car
what should i do
tell me what to do
harken yanks up the right leg of his jogging pants revealing an epi pen strapped to his ankle
he reaches for it but dale moves faster
what do i do with this
should i inject you
harken nods urgently as his eyes begin to roll back
okay hold on
i got this
dale takes the cap off the epi pen raises his arm and jams the needle into harkens chest
harken lets out a grunt
did i do it
did i get enough in
im gonna do it again
dale raises his arm again
nick continues to search around the bedroom
kurt is by the window
do you see a day runner or an address book
glances out the what the
dude check this out
nick joins him at the window and they both react as they see what appears to be dale repeatedly stabbing harken in the chest neck and arms
harken lies motionless on the sidewalk
dales killing harken
hes really doing it
out where everyone can see him
what the hell is he thinking
hes not stopping
hes gonna get us all caught
weve gotta get out of here
what about dale
hes a psychopath
we leave him behind
lets go through the back
as they hurry to leave the room kurt stumbles over the cat which has appeared yet again
unseen by either of them pellits blackberry slips out of his pocket and lands on the floor at the foot of harkens bed
as dale kneels over harken to check his breathing a car pulls up alongside and mrs
harken steps out
seeing her husband on the ground she rushes over
oh my god
he had an allergic reaction
but i think hes coming around
do you know him
hes my husband
harken kneels beside harken and supports his head
can you hear me
harken groggily looks down at his torso which is perforated by dozens of tiny needle marks
groggy to dale wha what did you do to me
i injected you with your thing
he saved your life honey
thank you so much
she grabs dale in a warm hug
oh it was nothing
harken whats this
whats with the hugging
im just thankful that he was here
ill bet you are
do you know this guy
we just are you fucking him rhonda
oh come on
what were you doing out here anyway
waiting to fuck my wife
ive never met your wife still a bit woozy harken gets to his feet and points at dale
you need to get the hell out of here
dave stop it
you should be thanking him
why are you being so suspicious
because i know you sleep around on me
and im going to find out who it is
youre being ridiculous
what about maurilio
i see the way you look at him
i am not having sex with the gardener
as harken and his wife continue to bicker dale quietly retreats to kurts car
nick and kurt pace nervously
i cant believe that idiot dale
you realize were all going to jail because of him
i cant go to jail
look at these eyes
look at this ass
theyll be all over me
yeah me too
what do you mean well
id get raped just as much as you
no of course you would
youre a good looking guy
you think youre more rape able than i am
i never said that dale enters
you guys are here
did you see me out there
yeah dale we saw you
pretty neat huh
no it wasnt neat
you stabbed harken to death in front of the whole neighborhood
not cool man
wait that was harken
whod you think you were stabbing
i wasnt stabbing anybody
that was an epi pen
he was having an allergic reaction to peanuts and i injected him
kurt and nick digest this for a beat
so let me understand this
my boss who we are trying to kill was dying in front of you and you saved his life
not cool man
wait you were just mad at me for killing him and now youre mad at me for not killing him
see this is why i needed to know what these people look like
hang on a sec
maybe this recon wasnt a waste of time
now we know harkens deathly allergic to peanuts and pellit has a huge stash of cocaine
we could put peanuts in harkens house and rat poison in pellits coke
everyone would assume that pellit just got a batch of tainted drugs
but harken must always have that epi pen on him
they consider this for a beat
i bet he doesnt wear it in the shower
we could put peanuts in his shampoo
two fatal accidents
and were not even there when they happen
that just leaves julia
tomorrow night ill surveil her and figure out how to take her down
ill get some rat poison and take care of pellit
dale think you can get some peanuts into harkens shampoo
i can do that
that just leaves us with one final thing to settle
dale if nick and i were in prison which one of us would get raped more
off dales confusion and nicks annoyance nick sits in his parked car watching the house through binoculars
through an upstairs window he sees pellit enter his bedroom
nick checks his coat pocket and confirms it contains a home depot bag with rat poison inside
nick dials his cell phone
kurt sits in his car reading maxim magazine
julias car pulls up
she gets out goes to the trunk opens it then bends down to get a bag of groceries
nick watches her ass appreciatively as she does and keeps watching as she heads into her building
sfx his cell phone rings
have you learned anything about julia yet
well ive learned that dale is a homosexual because this chick is unbelievably hot
hows it going over there
im just waiting for pellit to go to sleep
i wonder how dales doing with harken
dales car is parked
dale watches the movie precious on his laptop
he glances over to see harken turn on the light in his bedroom
on the seat beside dale we see a large jar of planters peanuts
harken looks around suspiciously then goes to mrs
he opens it and begins looking through her clothing
he sniffs one of her dresses and his eyes narrow
he sniffs himself then compares it to the smell of the dress
unsatisfied he continues searching around the room for any incriminating evidence
suddenly his foot comes in contact with something on the floor
he reaches down and picks up
he turns it on and scrolls down the contacts list to home which shows bobby pellits name and address
harkens face turns beet red
dale ducks down as he sees harkens garage door opening
harkens porsche pulls out and zooms up the street
still scooched down dale dials his phone
nick watches pellit performing a series of sweaty kung fu moves in a full length mirror
jesus where does he get the energy
whats up dale
harken just left his house
im going in
good luck man
dale flips on the light and enters clutching the peanut jar in his gloved hands
he slides open the shower curtain and harkens cat leaps out at him
he regains his composure and finds a bottle of mens shampoo
as he nervously removes the cap from the shampoo and the lid from the peanuts he notices that mr
peanut is staring right at him
despite his jaunty top hat and little monocle there is something almost accusing in his look
dale stares back at mr
peanut as we see his resolve soften
nick watches as pellit finally gets into bed and turns off his bedside lamp
here we go
nick reaches for the door handle as sfx nicks cell phone rings
nick jumps then answers the phone
im not sure if i can do this
where are you
in harkens bathroom
about to pour the nuts in his shampoo
but i just
i know hes a real shithead but hes still a person yknow
lights appear in nicks rearview mirror
looking down at the rat poison yeah
harkens porsche pulls up and stops just behind nicks car
harken gets out and heads toward pellits front door
what should i do
should i do it
suddenly nick looks up to see harken knocking on pellits door
in the bedroom pellits light goes on
what the fuck
i dont know
hes knocking on his door
how would harken even know pellit
looking irritated pellit answers the door
before he can get a word out
harken removes a gun from his pocket and shoots pellit twice in the chest
nick reacts slumping down in his seat horrified
oh my god oh my god oh my god
he shot him
harken shot pellit
oh my god
is he dead
with shaking hands nick reaches for his ignition but knocks the car keys out
they fall onto the floor of the car
as nick bends down to find his keys harkens shadow looms over him
nick cowers just out of sight
harken looks around
did he hear something
he calmly but briskly walks away from nicks car gets into his own and speeds off
what about pellit
hes not moving
he looks dead
what do we do
ive got to get out of here before someone sees me
meet me at the bar
ill call kurt
nick zooms away from the curb
nicks car speeds through a red light at an intersection
a traffic camera flashes as it snaps nicks photo and license plate
with trembling hands nick and dale take deep gulps of their drinks
kurt hurries in looking disheveled
the ensuing conversation is conducted in tense whispers
okay lets all stay calm and figure this out
how can we be calm
i watched a man die an hour ago
a man you were going to kill anyway
i dont know if i had it in me
i cant believe you guys
you cant just bail on a plan like that at the last minute
you think when it came down to it you wouldve been able to murder julia
i dont know
i mean afterwards it was kind of hard to imagine killing her
nick and dale turn to him quizzically
kurt realizes what he said
you slept with her didnt you
please tell me you didnt sleep with her
kurt lowers his head
you are a mess
i know i know
but its not my fault
kurts car is parked across the street
at first i was surveilling her just like i was supposed to
kurt watches through her bedroom window as julia undresses sexily
then she started deliberately undressing in front of the window
with the lights on
she mustve known i was there
as julia removes her bra we see kurts face pressed against his car window his breath fogging it up
julia enters her bedroom with a tray of food
she wears a skimpy kimono style robe
she sits on her bed and unwraps a popsicle
then she made herself a little snack
we see julia eat the popsicle as suggestively as humanly possible
then she picks up a banana and peels it
then a banana
julia eases the whole banana into her mouth
then she picks up a hot dog
and finally a hot dog
i mean three penis shaped foods cannot be coincidence
and in that weird order
thats not a proper meal
so you took that as an invitation to fuck her
julia opens her front door stares straight at kurt and beckons him inside with one finger
she walks back inside leaving the door wide open
i took her invitation to fuck her as an invitation to fuck her
kurt opens his car door so quickly he tumbles out headfirst planting his face on the street
he jumps up but one ankle is tangled in the seatbelt
he finally extricates himself and hurries to the house as fast as he can
there is something clinically wrong with you
im a rapscallion
youre not a rapscallion
youre a whore
a filthy whore
and besides i think i actually solved your problem dale
julia just needed a good fucking
i bet shes not going to mess with you anymore
we have bigger fish to fry right now
what do we do about harken
heres what we do
we call the cops and make an anonymous tip that harken killed pellit
harkens in jail
pellits in hell
julias had the crazy fucked out of her
our problems are solved
okay but we should find a payphone
we dont want them tracing the call to us
nick kurt and dale emerge from the bar
come on well take my car
the three of them climb into nicks car
before nick can even pull out of his parking spot they hear the whoop of a police siren and see the flashing lights of a squad car behind them
the guys faces go white
what the hell
nick unrolls his window as one cop approaches his side and his partner comes up on the other
are you the owner of this vehicle
is there something wrong
weve got an apb on a black kia spectra license hig
can i ask why
a traffic cam caught this vehicle fleeing the scene of a crime tonight
im going to need you to follow us to the station
this is not my car
is it okay if i just
all three of you please
nick glares at kurt as the cops head back to their car
kurt nick and dale sit in a waiting area looking equal parts terrified and pissed at each other
throughout the following they speak in hushed voices
they know everything
i cant believe i let you guys talk me into this
we were just being hypothetical
youre the one who pushed us to do it
we cant even say anything about harken now
uh well kurt being outside the murder victims house because i was planning to murder him probably isnt the best alibi in the world
you know i didnt actually do anything illegal so
you broke into two peoples houses and stole a blackberry
you gonna rat on me dale
well since im the only one without a connection to the murder yeah maybe i will
that means youd also rat on me
not if i rat on dale first
just then a burly detective hagan appears behind them
gentlemen this way please
the guys glare angrily at each other as they follow hagan
nick dale and kurt sit on metal chairs across a table from hagan and his equally burly partner samson
hagan slides a photo across the table to nick
taken by the traffic camera
his terrified face is clear as is the time stamp at the bottom
do you want to explain why you were driving in a zone a block from the victims house two minutes after he was shot to death
was drag racing
off their skeptical i am a drag racer
theres no law against that is there
actually there is
you were drag racing in a kia spectra
i dont win a lot
heres what i dont understand
youre at the crime scene
an hour later when we find your car you just happen to be hanging out with this guy
gestures to dale a registered sex offender tsk tsk
and this guy
gestures at kurt and holds up a wallet whose employee id says he works for pellit chemicals the victims company
my boss was murdered
you want me to get you a kleenex
i cant believe this
what were you doing near his house
nick looks at him pissed
where were you during the murder
i was making love
to the cops let me ask you something detective
lets say one of us knew who the shooter was and was willing to hand you that perp on a platter
would he be entitled to some sort of immunity for that information
both dale and nick shoot daggers at him
but he would be entitled to some sort of jail time
because if he knew who the shooter was and didnt tell us that would be obstruction of justice
well then im glad we have no idea who the shooter is right guys
if you expect us to believe this is all just a big coincidence were going to be here for a long time
now its kurt and nick who look nervous
is dale about to crack
saying that well be here for a long time implies that we cant leave
does that mean were under arrest
samson looks to hagan who grimaces
we just brought you in for questioning
so you dont have evidence constituting probable cause to arrest us
well then were free to go
dale nervously stands up half expecting to be hit
come on guys
kurt and nick impressed and relieved stand and head out
the three guys head for the exit
whered that come from
we really showed those guys
you were gonna turn us in
for like a second
the guys turn to see samson holding out a traffic citation
handing it to nick for speeding and running a red light
dont get too comfortable out there boys
our forensics team is sweeping pellits house for fingerprints and dna
and they dont miss much
we hold on kurts face and kurt pulls pellits toothbrush out of his butt and returns it to its holder
kurt suddenly looks nauseous
kurt drives nick is in front and dale in back
we are so fucked
maybe its time to lawyer up
i dont have money for a lawyer
i gave all my money to cocksucker jones
hey thats right
i forgot all about cocksucker
why dont we ask him what to do
we did pay him five thousand dollars to be our murder consultant
actually it was five thousand forty with the briefcase
off their looks cocksucker jones looks up from his bar stool surprised to see nick kurt and dale
oh damn look whos back
how did it go with the strangers on a train shit
we need your help
one of our intended victims killed another of our intended victims
cocksuckers eyes go wide
shut the fuck up
what kind of evil geniuses are you
we dont even know why it happened
but the cops brought us in as suspects
what do we do now
first things first
im gonna need another five thousand dollars
you said the last five thousand would cover this
pay for my drink
as nick puts down a few bills on the bar dale leans in to kurt
not the best negotiator is he
let me ask you this the guy who killed the other guy you were planning on killing are the police after him too
they dont suspect him
all right so youre gonna need to encourage him to turn himself in by say kidnapping his wife and mailing him her earlobe or something
naw the earlobes vestigial
off their looks all right how about you trick him into confessing what he did while you wear a wire
is that how the cops caught you when you murdered someone
what the hell are you talking about
i never murdered anyone
theres a beat
who told you i killed somebody
you said you served a dime for some pretty ugly shit
it was ugly
what was it
you ever see the movie snow falling on cedars
i got caught with a video camera making a bootleg copy of that movie
you did ten years for video piracy
hey thats a federal offense
they take that shit serious
i also made the mistake of representing myself at trial
may have insulted a few of the jurors
youre telling me weve been taking murder advice from someone whose biggest crime was taping an ethan hawke movie
so you do know it
if youre not a murderer why do you carry that gun on your belt
he pulls back his jacket to reveal the holster we saw earlier
this is a motherfucking iphone
he pulls the phone out and shows them
i feel like such a moron
well you are a moron
you dont walk into a bar and hand a guy five thousand dollars just because hes black
come on guys
lets get out of here
the three of them turn to go
calling after them trust me on the wire thing though
worked for donnie brasco
bootlegged that movie too
hagan and samson pull up in their car and get out
the detectives enter to find a crime tech leaning over his computer
you got something for us
we didnt find any foreign prints in the house but we did get a dna match for one of your suspects kurt gamble
where was it
pellits upstairs bathroom
it had traces of gambles fecal matter
that sick bastard
thats not all
we found feces on pellits hairbrush face soap floss and razor
not the blade
this gamble guy put just about everything in that bathroom up his ass
all i care about is that it puts him inside the house
thats enough for a warrant for him and his drag racing sex offender friends
takes out cell ill call the da
kurts car pulls up with the lights off and parks
kurt is at the wheel nick sits shotgun dale in back
okay looks quiet
is the tape recorder ready
dale pulls out a mini tape recorder and hands it to nick along with a roll of surgical tape
fresh batteries fresh six hour tape voice activated
one of us needs to tape it to our chest
ill do it
im the only one without hair on my chest
thats cause you shave it
i dont shave it
i wax it
nick gives kurt the recorder and kurt tapes it to his chest then lowers his shirt
so what do we do now
wait for harken to come home and ambush him
i have a better idea
lets be in the house when he walks in
hell be so mad hell be more likely to confess
well sit there in the dark till he comes in and then switch on a lamp
thatll freak him out
hey we should find an office chair so one of us can dramatically spin around and face harken
ill be in the chair
why do you get to be the guy in the chair
hes my boss
we could try and find more than one office chair so the three of us can spin around at the same time
that doesnt sound intimidating
that sounds like a musical number
i guess youre right
ill turn on the lamp
so im just supposed to stand there like an idiot
youre recording it all
youre the most important member of the team
dont patronize me nick
the guys tiptoe onto the porch peeking in the windows
nick tries the front door
and it swings open
they look at each other then quietly head inside
the lights suddenly come on
there are or partygoers in the house which is decorated for a birthday party
the guys stand dumbstruck
the revelry peters out as the guests realize there are three strangers at the door
harken steps up
who are you
sorry were late
i work with your husband arent you the young man who helped dave on the street the other day
hows he doing
thanks to you
then to nick did i invite you to this
before nick can answer a guest at the window calls out
his car just turned the corner
someone get the lights
as everyone scurries to hide kurt finds himself pressed up against mrs
harken beside the sofa
he checks her out
shaking her hand hi we didnt formally meet
nick didnt tell me that his boss was married to a model
noticing him now im not a model
when did you quit
we see mrs
harken is intrigued
just then the front door opens and harken enters
the lights come on
a jittery harken nearly jumps out of his skin as the crowd starts singing happy birthday
harken takes harkens arm
were you surprised
look everyones here
who are you talking about
i think you know
i need to put my stuff away
ill be right back
he heads off to his study leaving his confused wife
she notices kurt standing at the buffet staring at her
he smiles and winks
harken gives him a little wave
hes going off alone
this is our chance
you guys ready
still staring at mrs
harken so fucking ready
okay stay close
the three of them head toward the study
just as nick and dale enter harken looks up and sees them
what the hell are you doing here
you come to stab me a few more times you lunatic
and my wife invited you
are you fucking her too
nick tries his best to suppress his nervousness and be cool and threatening
we know what you did harken
what does that mean
we were there
we saw you kill him
so what is this
you think you can blackmail me because you saw me kill my wifes lover
say his name
nick and harken turn to dale
the guy you killed
what was his name
trust me pellits name doesnt matter anymore
there it is
turning to dale lets go guys he freezes as he sees for the first time that kurt didnt accompany them into the study
its just him and dale
nick looks around panicked
yeah i killed pellit hang on
hold that thought because i want to get my friend i walked right up to his door and i shot him in his fucking chest and ill tell you something
i liked it
so if you think im a pussy who wont do the same exact thing to some half assed blackmailer guess again
looking back at the you know who really thinks youre a pussy is my friend kurt
let me go grab him and you can tell him exactly what you just youre pathetic waters
you come into my home on my goddam birthday and try and pull this shit
well guess what
youre a dead man
you and your friend kurt whoever the fuck he is
we didnt know it was your birthday
harken has crossed to a drawer and taken out a small safe
he begins turning the combination lock
what are you doing
whats in that
just give me a second
nick and dale exchange a look then quickly rush out of the room
looking thoroughly freaked out nick and dale push their way through the partygoers
we had him
we had the whole thing
what happened to kurt
just then the door to a guest bathroom opens and kurt emerges buckling his belt and looking strangely red in the face
where were you
uh i had to go to the bathroom
bad salmon puff
are we ready to record harken
youre too late kurt
he confessed the whole damn thing
more than once
then he told us we were dead men
hes getting his gun right now
oh man im so sorry
i fucked up
yeah you suddenly the bathroom door opens again and out steps mrs
harken also looking disheveled
she adjusts her dress then rejoins the party
realizing what kurt you dick
overcome with rage nick punches kurt in the arm then rushes to the door
dale and kurt hurry after him
seeing them go
with a grim look he calmly heads to the garage
nick sits steaming mad as kurt drives
dan fiddles with the tape recorder in the back
look i wasnt thinking
shes so hot and im so weak
im a weak weak man
i admit it
from the back seat we hear from the tape recorder in here
but all those people are right outside
that makes it even hotter
we hear unbuckling and unzipping
your balls are so smooth
i wax them
is there anything you dont wax
we hear some wet smacking sounds
turn it off dale
that was fast
yeah dale turn that off
a short distance behind a car is following kurts
as it comes closer we see its a porsche
and its driven by a determined looking harken
kurts car turns the corner and stops short
from the guys pov we see an unmarked car and a police squad car parked outside of kurts place
hagan and samson stand with two uniformed officers
they must have found my dna
get us out of here
kurt quickly does a u turn and zooms off in the direction they came inadvertently speeding through a red light
we see a traffic camera flash
clearly showing the three guys their faces distorted with panic
okay its clear that none of us can go home again
im sure they have cops at all our places
i think our best bet is to get out of the country
where are we going to go
everyone flees to mexico
thats the first place theyll look
what about asia
we could become kick boxers
what the fuck are you talking about
what if our entire lives have been leading up to this moment
what if we were destined from the very beginning to become asian kick boxers
what if i was destined to smack you right in the face
that seems like a lesser destiny
sfx dales cell phone rings
julia lies in a bubble bath a glass of wine on the edge of the tub
look julia i cant talk right now kurt reacts at hearing its julia
he makes an im not here gesture
no worries baby
i actually meant to call your home phone
you know to tell stacy about us
i think ive waited long enough
im tired of you playing with my emotions
im not playing
im going to do it
at the office
what are you going to do to me
im going to
have sex with you
and be explicit
you want me to say it
weve got company
he points out the back window and the guys react as they see harken driving directly on their tail
his horsepower is no match for my
im gonna put my penis in your pussy
despite the danger kurt and nick turn curiously to look at dale
oh come on casanova
you can do better than that
im gonna make you feel good
with my tongue
and my fingers
just then harken speeds up and slams into the tail of kurts car
kurt struggles to stay on the road
jesus christ this guys nuts
you going to slap me with your cock dale
im going to beat your face with my cock
harken again hits kurts car from behind
a tail light shatters
im gonna put my balls in your hair
im gonna spit on your arms
kurt and nick exchange a baffled look
see you friday you dirty bird
julia hangs up
dale looks like hes been violated
nice job fucking the crazy out of her kurt
maybe i shouldve spit on her arms
good evening mr
the three of them jump startled by the sudden voice in the car with them
what the hell
this is gregory your on star rep
our on board sensors report that you have a damaged tail light
yeah thanks gregory we know
were being chased by a crazy man and he just smashed into us
kurt looks in the rearview mirror and sees harken is still behind them
as his car reaches an intersection kurt swerves at the last second and takes a hard left
harken overshoots the turn
i will alert the local police authorities and direct them to your location
dont call the police
theyre already after us
they think we murdered someone
suddenly kurts engine dies and the car comes to a gradual stop
why are you slowing down
the engine died
i have remotely disabled your engine
why would you do that gregory
its a standard on star safety protocol when we believe a driver has committed a crime
i pay nineteen bucks a month for this fucking service
please stay with your vehicle
the police should arrive shortly
i thought you were our friend gregory
theres a sound of screeching tires and harkens porsche zooms up behind them
hes not stopping
harkens car plows into the rear of kurts forcing it into the back of a parked car
even if the engine was working thered be nowhere to go now
dazed from the impact the guys look back to see harken slowly approaching on foot holding a gun in his hand
shit shit shit
harken taps on kurts window with the barrel of the gun
kurt lowers the window
im guessing you dont want to information
out of the car
all of you
the three guys nervously exit the car and face harken who points the gun at them
harken shut the fuck up
ive got six bullets in here
so if i want to i can shoot each of you twice just like i did that bastard pellit
but if i do that ill have to spend the rest of my life running from the law or rotting in jail
police sirens approaching
so youre not gonna shoot us
i have a better idea
harken turns the gun toward his own thigh and fires
as his leg bleeds harken wipes the gun off with his shirt then suddenly tosses it to dale
startled dale catches the pistol with shaking hands
now i can tell the cops that when i discovered you three killed pellit you tried to kill me to shut me up
down the street two squad cars turn the corner and speed toward them
dale looks down at the gun in his hand and drops it
because i dont see a shred of evidence proving that i killed pellit
its like ive always told you nick
life is a marathon and you cant win a marathon without putting a few band aids on your nipples
the three guys realize harkens won
then from the cars open window they hear did i mention that this conversation is being recorded
kurt nick and dale exchange a look of shock and relief
who said that
thats gregory our on star rep
my name is atmanand
harkens face falls
he looks around nervously as the police cars come to a halt
you cant this isnt and with that harken bolts away as fast as his injured leg will take him
its not very fast
the guys watch him for a beat as they share a joyful exhausted moment together
i think this is gonna work out okay for us
i told you
should we stop him
ive got this
looking to heaven this is for you gam gam
nick sprints off after his hobbling boss and in slow motion violently tackles harken to the pavement
harken goes down hard his face slamming against the asphalt
as the cops hurry toward them nick kneels on the back of harkens neck pinning him
get the fuck off me
kurt steps up and kneels beside the battered figure
hey harken one last thing
your wife gives great head
harken struggles wildly but hes helpless
the sun is shining
birds are chirping
its a bright new day as kurt heads into the building
kurt enters and looks over at what was pellits office
he smiles when he sees margie the pregnant employee now running the company
he heads over
kurt knocks on the doorframe and enters
oh hey kurt
i just wanted to congratulate you on taking over bobbys job
terrible what happened to him
tough month for the pellit family
anyway if theres anything i can do to help out before the baby gets here please let me know
beat offended im not pregnant
look at that big belly
kurt pats her belly
margie now looks genuinely pissed off
im aware that i have a weight problem kurt
it just happens to manifest itself in my lower abdomen
oh my god
im really sorry margie he falls silent under margies death stare
kurt i know you were a favorite of jacks
he was willing to overlook your inappropriate behavior with female clients and service people
but you should be aware im not jack
and i have very little tolerance for the mistreatment of women
so consider this your first strike
how was i supposed to know you were just fat strike two
kurt opens his mouth to say something but thinks better of it
he stands up and slumps out
life as he knew it at pellit chemicals is clearly over
julia enters to find dale waiting for her
a patient lies asleep in the chair his face obscured by the nitrous mask
thank god its friday right dale
lets drill this patient and then you can drill me
could we do it on top of the patient
i like the element of danger
you continue to surprise me you weird little man
julia quickly undoes the patients belt and yanks his pants down
you like that
this getting you hot
julia begins handling the patients implied genitals which are obscured by a tray of tools
in a puppet voice i wish i was dales weenie so i could have sex with julia
suddenly the patient bursts out laughing and sits up
what the hell
the patient pulls off his nitrous mask to reveal its kenny the guys former classmate from the bar
i couldnt keep it together anymore what is this
julia meet my old high school friend kenny
how do you do
kenny will do just about anything for fifty bucks and thats why i hired him to help me frame you
your days of sexually assaulting me and your patients are over
this is all youve got
your word against mine
im a highly respected professional and youre two losers
dale points to the window where julia sees cocksucker jones outside holding up a video camera
he waves to her
you little bastard shut up julia
now my fiancee and i are going to take a very expensive two week vacation which youre going to pay for
and then im going to come back to a rape free workplace
because if you so much as look at my ass ill have yours locked up
with a bounce in his step dale strides out of the room
theres an awkward beat with kenny and julia
i dont suppose you could take a look at this molar kenny scampers out pulling up his pants as he goes
nick is in his new office as a young employee carter s pops his head in
you wanted to see me mr
just wanted to check if you had a chance to finish those regional sales projections yet
oh i think i may need another day
i was hoping to give them to the marketing guys today but i can hold them off
in the future itd be great if you could tell me if youre going to miss a deadline
carters eyes narrow
all at once he rushes at nick grabs him by the throat and hurls him through the plate glass window shattering it
nick plummets forty feet and lands with a sickening crunch directly onto his own car
just behind him we see a parking plaque that reads nick waters senior vp of sales
carter stands opposite nick as before
no problem mr
nick smiles and closes the door behind carter
he settles into his comfy chair and puts his feet up on the desk
its good to be the boss
