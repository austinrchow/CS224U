written by louis mellis david scinto stagnant black water
a desolate canal
onto dark stones
darkest slate grey cobbles
and on through streets
pastal disused victorian broken windowed derelict buildings and wharf side warehouses with rotten oaky loading beams and rusted iron chains
mossy mildewed walls
dripping fetid water from corroded dilapidated ancient ruined guttering
into a pinched arched alleyway if anything darker blacker
and if we listen if we strain our ears listen we can hear music faint
take me back to dear ol blighty as if sung by a jolly girl in a long gone bar surrounded by drunken men
we keep moving
the music growing
in the distance a faint glow
dirty yellow diffused misty light
we move towards it
towards the piss coloured light
in the middle of nowhere
and the music fades
all we have is all we can see
the gable end of an old house
limey light bleeding weakly from a broken filthy window
all is still suddenly it comes crashing down the end wall comes crashing down a flurry of bricks and mortar
the tumble of masonry
and through clouds of brick dust and rubble we see figures inside
through a smokey powdered fog we can see a group of men in the downstairs room of the derelict house
on the walls faded s wallpaper peeling in parts to reveal older dim patterns
a window crudely boarded up
a few unmatched armchairs in various states of disrepair a s black vinyl a deco patterned smoker a s cream plastic a brown wooden kitchen chair etc
the colours in the room are browns greys caramels darks muted
in the middle of the room standing on dusty bare wooden floorboards his fist clenched aggressively by his sides is old man peanut aged
wearing a dark three piece suit
gold watch chain
he is squaring up to us
slightly behind to his left sitting nonchalantly cross legged in a battered brown leather wingback armchair and casually smoking a davidoff cigarette is meredith late s
wearing black handmade boots black saville row suit black cashmere roll neck sweater herring bone overcoat with a black velvet collar brown leather gloves his jet black hair is heavily
behind him an old wardrobe
standing with his back three quarters to us and leaning on a broken chipped mantelpiece over a smashed tiled fireplace is archie aged
wearing a car coat and casual nondescript clothes
he is pouring himself a captain morgans rum from a bottle into a polystyrene cup
he sort of sees us is not fussed drinks
standing at the back of the room in front of a door which has at some time been on fire its yellowing tobacco ey paint charred and blistered is mal
aged mid s
wearing a silver grey suit white shirt duck egg blue silk tie
there is another man in the room but we do not see his face for he s its slu mpe d h ead in his han ds in o ne
of t he armchairs a picture of despair
he wears an olive green shirt brown trousers maroon braces
this is colin aged late s
blackness and silence
in the silent black an outsize boot appears scuffed and tatty
attached to skinny legs in black tights
the legs gangle and flip pulling into view a bony pasty bare torso which is undulating oddly and here comes the head
long lank shoulder length hair
dripping from a white domed pate the face poker straight in contrast to the comedic body antics a grave grey face fleshy bulbous rubbery
ladies and gentlemen max wall
he goon walks about for a bit in the black space
as if knees tied together
aflickin and akickin his clown boots
his unhappy face
giant c u on his morose contorted phizzog
directly to us

pink revised st may
chest in caucasian flesh coloured writing on black
we see chest hairs in the lettering
without you by nilsson
we are out of focus on purple
scattered sparkling jewels
begin to come into focus and we see that they are in fact pieces of broken glass
thousands of splinters and shards strewn across a purple wilton carpet
the white fur of a luxurious sheepskin rug in bits
ripped to shreds
in extreme c u we begin to move along the floor slowly taking in mor e de bri s of d est ru ct io n
sm as he d c ha ir s
sm as he d photographs
ripped shredded record sleeves the power of love by jennifer rush hopelessly devoted to you by olivia newton john i will always love you by whitney houston etc
the tv remote smashed to smithereens
the television widescreen totalled
we move along the plush world of leather leather sofa
see that a chunk has been bitten out of it
see teeth marks like a bite out of cheese
moving on past an area of slashed carpet and underfelt
approaching the legs of a si deboard and see ing into the bla ckness underneath
we can just make out the quizzical frightened eyes of a white poodle
we move on
past twisted wrecked lampshades
broken plates ornaments
an up ended vase of half eaten flowers
nilsson continues his self pitying overwrought ballad and as he hits the massive masochistic chorus crescendo we come across colin lying rigid on his back in the corner of the
his shocked eyes staring wildly
his body petrified
as if frozen at the height of an epileptic fit like something from pompeii like max schrek as nosferatu hit by light
we stay on colin
his uncomprehending terror filled eyes
his sheer rigor mortis like horror
we move in on him
into the black of his eyes
the tragic agonised black
we are outside square on to an upstairs window of a detached suburban villa
we hear muffled sounds from inside the house
and suddenly the glass window explodes towards us as a desperate terrified woman comes crashing through
having run full pelt to escape from something
this is liz aged
archies mum aged is eating soup from a tray on her lap
archie aproned watches on fondly
ows that mum
s gorgeous archie
put hairs on your chest that will
pananaramall be on soon after the new s
da vi d dim bl e bim bl eb y
eating what is this
king of soups
now a phone rings elsewhere in the house

he leaves the room
goes into the darkened pokey hallway
takes his mobile phone from his car coat pocket

well get there much quicker if you re al is es col
music without you by nilsson
colin as before lying in the wrecked room
the music ends
suddenly we hear archies voice
cmon mate this is no good
we now see archie sitting in a nearby armchair smoking patient
cmon mate you cant lie ere forever
the rigid colin ignoring him has suddenly belatedly realised that the music has stopped
desperately needing his friend nilsson like a man in excruciating pain reaching for a gallon of morphine he frantically urgently twists his body on the floor and reaching behind hammers
the play button on the nearby ghetto blaster
and slowly gently kindly the piano intro of nilssons gorgeous wallow re commences
colin somewhat soothed eases back into his former rigid mortified position
meredith sits on a sofa staring intently at another man on an opposite sofa
a phone begins to ring
the phone continues to ring
amiable allo arch
we are on mal in the back of the scruffy van seated on the wheelbase
opposite him is meredith calmly smoking
colin slumped beside him in the passenger seat
concerned you alright col
but colin is sobbing
sobbing his heart out
archie looks in the rear view mirror at mal
who in turn looks to meredith who calmly smokes raising an eyebrow
now the van swings into a cul de sac headlights illuminating a row of tatty garages and picking out old man peanut who stands there stony faced
mal opens the rear door
old man peanut clambers in
archie throws the van into reverse and takes off again
the van double parked engine running
colin still slumped in his seat staring teary eyed at the dash board
meredith and old man peanut in the back focused on the exterior of an italian restaurant
busy bustling atmosphere
customers becoming aware of a co mm o ti on at t h e ba c k of th e r es t au ra n t
n o w th e ir consternation grows as mal who has got hold of one of the waiters we cannot see his face as his red shirt has ridden
up over his head in the struggle is violently relentlessly frog marching him at great pace towards the door
we are with archie overseeing the operation
archie wheels round wielding an outsize pepper grinder like a club
crash zoom in on him
menacingly just get on with yer meals
concentrate on your snails
he too backs out of the door
meredith and old man peanut watching as mal the waiter and archie spill onto the street
archie discarding the giant pepper grinder as he goes
the hapless waiter is bundled into the back of the van
archie gets in
it drives off
archie holding a carrier bag of shopping is in conversation with another man biggy walpole aged wears tweed sports jacket cavalry twills brown suede brogues handlebar moust ache daily mail
under his arm his dog rosemary a wire haired terrier by his side

beginning to move off well ill catch ya later biggy
beginning to walk off in the other direction toodle pip
archie is walking away
biggy and rosemary in the other direction
suddenly biggy stops
stares darkly at the departing figure of archie who ambles off unaware
biggy is staring with such hatred
we move in on his face
his hating face
we are close up
he stares just off camera
seems he is growling
and now his hand claw like comes into frame
he is reaching towards us
and slowly his hating eyes follow
and he is staring right at us
pink revised st may
the room is as described in the prologue albeit with gable wall intact
mal stands by the crumbling mantelpiece his back to the room
touches the back of his head as if something has brushed against him

colin gulping looks at each of them in turn
looks at the coin
swallows again tosses it
the coin spins upwards into the air
humungous c u of the coin spinning music begins chills fever by tom jones
huge c u
the coin spinning
the men watch the coin land on heads
the music continues
we fade in on
mal in motion
pacing like a lion
serious faced hard eyed
focused on something just off camera
we see meredith seated
super sexy slowly
focused on something just off camera
caught mid expression
mid horrible expression
vicious denture manoeuvres
old man horrendousness
focused on something just off camera
dear old archie
swigging from a bottle
and focused on something just off camera
down at the floor
the music fades
and now we see the room
the men as described and the object of their focus
seated on a small wooden kitchen chair is a figure with a scruffy old tesco carrier bag over its head
the wardrobe is open
the figure is cowed
pink revised st may
the men are relaxed all the time in the world

he glances at the wardrobe the door opens and archie pops his heap in

archie goes closing the door
the colours grey brown ochre dirty cream black sombre
at the far end is a dilapidated front door
to the right of rotting stairs with broken wooden banisters
meredith sits smoking on top of a knack ered upr ight pia no
o ld m an p eanu t si ts grouchily on the keys
mal partly hidden sits smoking on the stairs
archie is gently closing the door to the main room
walking up the corridor towards the men us
casually s he alright

the figure slowly nods thank you

last night i couldnt see anythin what wi t h a l l t h e r a g e a n d t h a t t h e
disappointment come on then lets ave a look at you
slowly colin goes towards the figure
stands in front of it
stares at i t
suddenly his hands grab at the black plastic he roughly tears it open eventually revealing the bloody vest and pant ed body
now he slowly lifts the crumpled tesco bag from the head and we see the bowed beaten face of loverboy early s
you know youre not a bad looking boy
yeah i can see the attraction
but if you dont mind my sayin so isnt it all a bit obvious
bit of a cliche
pause what was she doing
silly cow what a stupid woman
colin slowly returns to his seat
uncaps the brandy
pours some into the cap and drinks it
to loverboy you dont know the first thing about her
bet shes never farted in front of you has she
i thought not
its not romantic is it
you just wanted the perfumed clouds of love
the magicalness of it all
all the false crap
well ive got news for you s onny j im t hats not l ove
that s in erm whatdyamacallit fatuation
tha ts wh at it is
thats not fuckin love
loves ard work
love can be murder
its putting her first not you
watching what she wants to watch on telly
taking her the papers and a cup of tea in bed on a sunday morning
as to how she might be feeling
you alr ig ht l iz
pl ump in g up he r pillows
and she might get irritated by tha t
leave me in peace for gods sake
and that might hurt hearing that
her saying that
but youve got to ta k e i t o n t he c hi n
h av e b r oa d shoulders
cos shes the queen and youre the bee
and so wh a t i f y ou co o k t h e d in n er an d theres no thanks for it
dont do it if you expect thanks for it
thats not w hy yo u do it
e nj oy th e washing up whistle while you work
and if she shouts through for you to shut up please stop whistling then shut up

and yes youve ignored the dripping tap or whatever for five years but one day for whatever reason fuck knows why you get up off your fat arse and you
find yourself under the sink with a span ner in your hand and yo ure s m i l i n g a way like fuck
cos you know that its gonna please her
and if she dont notice it she dont notice it
it dont matter

the nitty gritty
it aint easy
nobody ever said i td b e easy and theyre right
its hard work

pink revised st may
loverboy gradually painfully lifts his bowed head
slowly very slowly he turns
and looks at colin
they look at each other
his face is blank
matter of fact
his eyes dull
he is thick set
he wears a scruffy tweed coat
a flat working mans cap a thick battered gypsy belt and he is busy bundling a live cockerel into the hessian sack before him
in with the snake
in with the dog
in with the man the beaten terrified whimpering man in the sack
the four creatures in there together
pandemonium in the sack as he ties it off
brutishly dragging the hellish parcel to the edge of the pier and lazily booting it into the dark sea below
he tur ns now
his task com pleted
and couldnt give a monkeys as he looks with zero compassion down the barrel of the camera at us
he walks off disappearing into the foggy night
this was brighton billy
in the gloomy dirty silent water the tethered sack descends hellish movement inside
the men as before

on e n i gh t s h e s dru gge d im
p ut a po tio n in i s drink
c u on a bejewelled golden goblet of red wine on a marble surface
now a many braceleted beautiful arm and heavily ringed hand of a woman comes into view
powder is gently poured into the goblet
hes gone all woozy and hes conked out on the marble floor
pink revised st may
shes crept off like the rat she is and shes come back
with a pair of scissors and shes giveim the full monty
short back and sides
we are c u on the back of a head of extremely long hair the same ringed hands wielding scissors frenziedly hack and chop in a flurry of hair barbarism
next mornin hes woke up
gone into the bathroom for a wash
looked in the mirror
seen the state of his barnet and hes flipped is lid
hes hit the roof
hes gone apeshit
we see samson
hunky handsome beefcake
his hair cut superman style
smashing the roo m up

his strength was in his hair you see
he cant even pick up his fuckin toothbrush
from then on his life was terrible
they stabbed is eyes out
stuck im in a dungeon
bread and water
mornin noon and night
samson chained up sporting a pudding basin cut
his bare back being lashed by two burly uniformed soldiers
over this we hear
pink revised st may
his life was a fuckin misery
c u on samsons agonised face as hes being whipped his hair something of a bob
over this we hear
but all the while see his hairs growin back in
c u on samsons agonised face as hes being whipped his hair somewhat pageboy
over this we hear
hes gettin stronger
long haired chained up alone in the dungeon
presently the sound of the heavy door being unbolted
slowly it eases open
and there stands delilah tears in her eyes
she comes to visit im
tries to make it up
she throws herself on him
is all over him
smothering him with kisses
we see samsons harsh hard set face as hes being kissed
but he dont want to know
well he sort of does
sud de nl y t he c ha ine d up s ams on s pu rns t he r epe nt an t delilah
he lashes out with his sandaled foot
and boots her across the room
she lands like a sack of potatoes against the wall
now by this stage his hairs down ere
indicates on himself
and his mights comin back slowly but surely
comes the day of the big party in the temple and hes well up for it
bent on vengeance
but hes got fuck all on im no weapons no nothin no matter
pink revised st may
lavish debauched frivolities philistines macedonians persians etc having a ball
to one side of the dance floor we see the forlorn figure of samson
hes chained up between these two columns great thick pillars
and all the guests are taunting im
slaggin im off
we see this
liberties being taken with poor samson
women teasing him
dwarfs kicking him
a camp chap in a robe lifting samsons tunic to reveal his undergarments samson somewhat mincily twists and writhes squirms in a vain attempt to protect his modesty
but it is hopeless the tau nter s s quea l w ith del ight at his pa thet ic plight
callin im this and that
every name under the sun and he thinks right fuck you lot ave some of this
samson incensed begins to push mightily against the pillars his face a mask of crazed revenge old man peanut is determinedly pushing against the walls of the hallway
the others slightly bored vaguely amused watch him
pushing the walls and with is bare hands
is simple big bare fuckin hands hes pushed and hes pushed
pushed and pushed uffin an puffin eavin an oin
until the ve r y f o u n d a t i o n s o f t h e h o u s e o f debauchery start
to crack to yield
and im tellin ya they built things proper in them days
built to last this was no mean feat
and with one mammoth shove
one terrible thrust
hes brought the whole kaboodle crashin to the ground
hes killed the whole fuckin tot of em
pink revised st may
panic stricken party goers fleeing in terror
rushing towards and past the camera
behind them the temple in ruins
limbs sticking out of the rubble
he didnt give a fuck about imself by this point
and all because
music begins this that by tom jones
loverboy is as before
we see the back of colin as he leans on the mantelpiece
deep in thought
and all because
the streets deserted
foreboding colin sits in front of loverboy
staring intently at him
and all because
pink revised st may
the stre ets seem ingl y de sert ed
we become aware of the gentle clicking of high heel shoes
colin stands directly behind loverboy
staring down murderously at him
and all because
colin slowly lifts his head
and stares down the barrel of the camera
c u on old man peanut
of a woman
colin staring darkly at loverboy
i was up at the window
the broken window
i called to her
she couldnt have heard me
couldnt have heard me
i went fuckin bananas
went fuckin spare

and its bang this and its bang that
like sonny and fuckin cher
i almost killed the family dog
you almost killed the family dog
dyou accept that youve spunked all over my marriage
loverboy slightly nods
pink revised st may
note that the prisoner has nodded his head
how do you plead
before sentence is passed do you have anythin to say for yourself
no you dont
take him away
im gonna strangle your eyeballs out
gonna embed your ead in that wall
he lunges towards loverboy
murderously his hands about to strangle
colin freezes in his tracks shocked at what he has heard
what he thinks he has heard
backs away from loverboy
makes his way gingerly to the filthy window
tries to clear the accumulated grime with the palm of his hand
eventually can just about see through onto the street
all seems quiet deserted
he catches a glimpse a blur of red a figure
backing away from the window slightly
then edging closer again
yds away standing stock still staring back at him
she is glamorous
a slinky red cocktail dress
un bloody un marked un scathed
full make up
a fantastic face
a fantastic face
staring back at him
shell shocked liz
walks into the dark
and is gone
colin desperate cant see properly smashes the filthy pane of glass with his elbow
suddenly legs appear at the window
striding silently past
but they are giant she must be ft tall
and now they are gone
colin turns back into the room now populated with omp meredith mal and archie
colin stands strong
as strong as he can
holding his head high as high as he can
looking towards the door
as it slowly begins to open
shes got some fuckin balls ill tell ya
she has got some fuckin balls
and now she appears
in the doorway
and colin is looking at her
the men have taken their seats interested
pink revised st may
i knew shed show her jezebel face
to loverboy ere romeo things are lookin up
the cavalrys arrived
cant you smell it
colin is looking at her
but her loveliness is sapping his strength
he cant take it

he crumples into a nearby armchair
his face averted from all
eventually look ing a t lov erbo y

archies head is on mals body standing
mals head is old man peanuts body sitting
c u on colins face
he cant believe it
addresses the meredith liz person perplexed whats appenin meredith
but this figure does not reply
the response comes from the liz meredith combo
but with old man peanuts voice oh im not meredith
but with archie s gruff voice oh gawd
especially by the relaxed cross legged smoking sexy bodied feminine form disturbingly topped with the nasty old head of old man peanut
but with merediths smooth voice my name is max

immaculate in a dove grey chauffeurs uniform below the window
on the impressive gravel drive
tending to an orange coloured bentley
over this we hear
liz hates me
shes a lady
fuck all to do cept shop and wank
bored out of her box
shes at the window
looking out looking down
we see the upper regency window
behind it staring through looking down is liz
wearing electric pink jodhpurs
leaf green silk blouse and stock
her face spectacularly made up severe
over this we hear
im in the drive waxing the bentley
i can feel her eyes
scorching through my dove grey uniform
but ill be damned if im gonna look at her

meredith stops waxing

well colin since you ask
youre the thing in the basement
with the hood on

we are at the foot of the stairs
can hear footsteps descending
and now old man peanut appears
carrying a battered old suitcase
he opens the heavy wooden studded creaking dungeon door and enters
we see a figure trussed up in bin bags and with an old tesco bag on its head hanging from a meat hook
old man peanut slams down the case
inside a jumbled variety of rusty tools gadgets implements
from the tangled hardware he manages to extract a thick rusty file
an ancient heavy plane
a mallet and a six inch nail
uttering to himself
this is gonna urt you much more than its gonnaurt me
i feel for ya i really dont
turns and addresses the hanging figure
youre mincemeat mate
all in the room

liz staring at him
taken aback wha
pink revised st may
colin staring at her
a car has parked on the motorway
its door ajar
the driver is hurriedly scrambling down the muddy grass verge
towards the body of liz
she turns her head slowly and with great difficulty towards him
faintly help me
liz battered scrambling around on the kitchen floor
colin mad grabbing a knife
screaming in her face
liz somehow managing to squeeze through the kitchen door
colin after her like a fiend
her going down again
him stamping on her
like shes the worst dog in the world
hes going to kill her
a howling wounded beast
he r la s t ve st i ge o f s tr en gt h
f o rc in g h er se lf up
running scrambling in absolute terror
through the lounge
banging off walls and furniture
and still hes in pursuit
her lifes going to end here
she takes her chances
runs at it
to get away
runs at it
running at the window
straight at the window
and crashing through
and colin shocked
and cant believe it
and brought closer to his senses
him going to it
going to the shattered window
a weak man
and holding onto the window frame to stay upright
and looking out
and seeing her getting up and struggling
and running away
from the monster at the window
she has gone into the night
i love you liz
i love you
liz its rainin
sobbing and sobbing and sobbing pink revised st may
we are on colins face
his heartbroken face
awash with tears
tears for her

old man peanut squaring up to use
ultra mean direct to camera two years later i was dead
i passed away in the small hours in a nursing ome in slough with a drip in me arm me gnashers in a mug by the bed and me boots
most definitely on
id done me hip in the spring and couldnt cope with meself no more at ome if you must know
i died in a orrible fuckin room theyd give me in the midst of a bunch of doddery decrepit dribbling old mongs
come the time this dragon witch bitch of a nurse arsked me if i wanted a fuckin priest
to make my peace
i arsk you
i told em where to get off
told em all to fuck off out of it and leave me to meet my maker on my jack todd
i lay on my pit like a scabby baby and waited for it
waited for it
waited for it to come
and get me
it came alright
the reaper came alright
in the middle of the fucking night like a burglar like a worry
i opened my milky minces and saw
the ugly brute of it
its black mouth
its cocky eyes
ungry like the wolf
my time was up
i was wanted
ill break you it said
ill fucking break you
i stared at it
hissed at it
spat at it
i raised myself up from the stainy cot with my weak bony arm
got myself in a proud position my spine ramrod straight
it was reaching for me
grabbing at me
laughing at me
direct to camera ive got a new boyfriend
i havent had a steady in years
hes black aged beautiful
works in the city
i love that name
met him in a sauna
he looked at me i looked at him he looked at me
that sort of thing

he cant swim i like cars so on and so forth
took it from there
weve been together three weeks now

he went off to work
i fancied a stroll
opped on a bus
hyde park and im walkin
past the ducks

we dont acknowledge each other
and i just carry on walking
is he a liar or shouldnt i have been there

he looks over his right shoulder
pink revised st may
a vignette of his mum and hazel sitting on an old sofa drinking tea and chatting happily
behind them on a floral wallpapered wall is a painting spanish woolworths style
a wounded th century soldier is slumped in a chair being tended to by a wild exotic gypsy flamenco type woman
nearby standing alarmed humiliated and cuckolded wearing a white frilly puffy sleeved shirt red breeches with a gold stripe black boots is the shocked faced husband
these three characters bearing an uncanny resemblance to guess who
c u on archie as he turns back to look at us
the vignette has gone
proud they get on brilliantly
im taking them to ikea this afternoon
raises his eyebrows
intimate with us
say a prayer for me
we can just see part of mal
his face half in shadow
he is looking at us
he slips into the shadows
colin emerges onto the street
closes the door behind him
we move in on his brave sad face as he gazes up at the old bluey london sky and says to lizs spirit
very quiet be lucky liz
slowly he begins to walk the wet street
away from us
towards his new life
