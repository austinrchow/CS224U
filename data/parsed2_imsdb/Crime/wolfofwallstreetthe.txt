drunken stockbrokers most in their early s chant wildly as jordan belfort handsome stands beside a dwarf dressed in tights cape helmet
twenty five grand to the first cocksucker to nail a bullseye
the bullseye is a large dollar sign in the middle of a giant velcro dartboard
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages watch and learn people
the brokers go apeshit as jordan grabs the dwarf by his pants and collar
in the crowd cash flies as side bets are made
jordan winds up aims for the dartboard
the brokers cheer and as the screaming dwarf takes flight hurtling toward camera we freeze frame my name is jordan belfort
no not him me
im a former member of the middle class raised by two accountants in a tiny apartment in bayside queens
jordan smiles as he poses behind a lemonade stand his parents max and leah behind him jordan stands holding a styrofoam cooler selling ices on the beach jordan smiles as
he holds an amway sales brochure
the year i turned i made million dollars as the head of my own brokerage firm a cherry red ferrari testarossa zooms down the l
which really pissed me off because it was three shy of a million a week
the ferrari weaves in and out of traffic
hey my ferrari was white like don johnsons in miami vice
we see the same ferrari now in white as it zooms away a blonde head bobbing up and down in jordans lap
a twin engine bell jet helicopter descends over a huge mansion with sparkling pool tennis court and waterfall
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages see that humongous estate down there
thats my house
we see naomi blonde and gorgeous a living wet dream in laperla lingerie
my wife naomi the duchess of bay ridge brooklyn a former model and miller lite girl
naomi licks her lips shes incredibly painfully hot
yeah she was the one blowing me in the ferrari so put your dick back in your pants
over the following we see a quick all taken from tv a mansion from lifestyles of the rich and famous wealthy people applauding at a polo match a yacht sailing
crystal blue seas robert wagner and stephanie powers toasting with champagne on hart to hart
in addition to naomi and my two perfect kids i own a mansion private jet six cars three horses two vacation homes and a foot yacht
sweaty wild eyed and naked jordan fucks an hispanic hooker from behind
i also gamble like a degenerate drink like a fish fuck hookers maybe five times a week and have three different federal agencies looking to indict me
he dismounts snorts some coke through a straw then uses it to blow some into her asshole
oh yeah and i love drugs
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages jordan looks up suddenly paranoid as if hes hearing voices
jordan drooling and stoned out of his skull wears a rumpled custom made business suit as he mans a set of controls next to his frantic co pilot captain dave
were gonna crash
jordans head bobs as he pulls back on the stick
the helicopter rises sharply then levels out hovering feet above a huge mansion
down below through jordans hazy double visioned pov we see a sparkling pool tennis court and waterfall
check this out despite my completely fucked up state i could fly straight while still seeing two of everything
he closes one eye his pov sharpens
putting pressure on the stick the helicopter descends slowly over the driving range
then lurches and slams to the ground
to captain dave ya guzza git hazarous doozy pay buddy
sober now impeccable in suit and tie jordan heads for the door holding a glass of orange juice
yes on a daily basis i take enough drugs to sedate greater long island
he pops two white pills swigs some juice then speaks directly to the camera as he heads for a waiting limo
i take quaaludes for my back fifteen to twenty a day
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages i use xanax to stay focused ambien to sleep pot to mellow out cocaine to wake up and morphine because its awesome
the limo pulls up to the black glass office building
jordan gets out heads inside through a back door
but of all the drugs under gods blue heaven theres one thats my absolute favorite
gadgets computers oxblood leather furniture
with the din of the brokerage firm bleeding in jordan uses a credit card to cut a line of coke on his desk
as he peels a crisp dollar bill off a wad rolls it up enough of this shitll make you invincible able to conquer the world and eviscerate your enemies
he snarfs up the line gestures to the cocaine
im not talking about this
im talking about this
jordan unfurls the with a snap money is the oxygen of capitalism and i wanna breathe more than any other human being alive
he crumbles it into a ball and tosses it into a corner where it comes to rest with two dozen others
over his back as we track him out of his office toward what sounds like the roar of a mob money doesnt just buy you a better life better food
better cars better pussy it also makes you a better person
you can give generously to the church of your choice or the political party
you can save the fucking spotted owl with money
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages arms akimbo jordan stands above the bullpen a huge open space with tightly packed rows of maple colored desks
but most of all in any country in the world money can buy you love
fuck the beatles
his brokers mostly young men with their jackets off scream wildly
they worship him
with that in mind at the tender age of after marrying my girlfriend teresa an express bus pull up its sign reads wall street
i headed to the only place that befit my high minded ambitions
jordan emerges kisses teresa goodbye then joins a sea of commuters heading to work
you are lower than fucking pond scum
computers telephones everywhere
at their desks shirt sleeved brokers read their wall st
journals readying for war
like an eager puppy jordan follows broker jerry fogel thick lipped and bow tied
you got a problem with that
reads name tag jordan
no problem at all
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages your job is connector which means youll be dialing the phone over times a day trying to connect me with business owners
and till you pass your series thats all youll be doing
jordan takes a seat at the desk next to fogels
just so you know last year i made over k and the other guy youll be working for made a million
a million dollars
i could only imagine what a douchebag that guy must be
a manicured hand lands on jordans shoulder
its mark hanna s charismatic movie star handsome
re fogel good youve met jerry
one of the smartest guys in the office
whos ever sucked a dogs cock out of loneliness
fogels smile turns to a frown
he hands jordan a stack of x index cards
smile and dial
and dont pick your fucking head up till one
dont mind jerry his father raped him as a child
besides im senior broker here hes a worthless piker
i heard you pitched stock at your job interview

i fuckin love that
lets grab lunch later
windows good with you
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages hanna gives him a wink looks at the clock on the giant electronic stock ticker encircling the room a
absolute pandemonium at the bell signalling the opening of the stock market
feet fly off desks brokers and their connectors dial phones like mad
the camera pushes in on jordan mesmerized as he takes in the roar
to broker miniscribes a fuckin steal
thirty eight bucks a share
into headset your broker in west virginia
what are you buying a coal mine
its the s the game is high tech
to broker fuckface
i got july s
you want to know what money sounds like
visit a trading floor on wall street
fuck this shit that
cock cunt asshole
i couldnt believe how these guys talked to each other fogel notices jordan sitting there frozen
he covers his mouthpiece kicks the desk violently
dial the cocksucking phone
jordan snaps out of it starts dialing
i was hooked within seconds
mark hanna slams down his phone in victory scrawls out a buy ticket
he places the ticket into a glass cylinder which he slips into a plastic pneumatic tube
it was like mainlining adrenaline
the tube is whooshed into the ceiling and were suddenly
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages close on a coke spoon whose contents disappear up a nostril
pull back to reveal
the lunchtime power spot with panoramic views of the city
at a corner table a paranoid jordan looks around as hanna does another bump of coke
none of the other diners seem to notice or care
offering the spoon got enough for one more
hanna slips the vial into his pocket as hector the tuxedoed maitred approaches
hanna what can i bring for you on this glorious afternoon
hanna surreptitiously palms hector a jordan notices
heres the game plan hector
bring us two absolut martinis straight up
precisely seven and a half minutes after you deliver those youll bring two more then two more every five minutes until one of us passes out
an excellent strategy sir
actually im good with up
jordan might as well have farted at the table
first day on wall street hector
give him time
hector offers menus no thanks im not eating
hector heads off
you can get high during the day and still function
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages high is the only way to do this fucking job
guy who coined the term three martini lunch was a woman
cocaine and hookers my friend the keys to success
jordan smiles not sure if hanna is kidding
i gotta say im really excited about being part of your team
i wanna do all i can for our clients and reciting an ad here at l
rothschild our clients arent just important theyre family
just as long as we get our taste first
remember something jordan your top priority in this job make us money
if the clients get rich along the way bully for them
got a girlfriend
she cuts hair
mark swallows a comment about that
gets to business
ok first rule of wall street
nobody and i dont care if youre warren buffet or jimmy buffet nobody knows if a stocks going up down or fucking sideways least of all stock brokers
but we have to pretend we know
make sure you stay relaxed
nobody wants to buy something from someone who sounds like they havent gotten laid in a month
take breaks when you feel stressed jerk off if you can
you like jerking off right
good jerking off is key
and i highly recommend cocaine which will make you dial faster which is good for me
churn em and burn em baby
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages a busboy stops by with a fresh napkin for mark who thanks him
then discreetly as possible mark removes a fresh vial of cocaine tucked within and takes a quick snort
jordan realizes thats why he palmed the maitre d
for the next six months i learned the ways of wall street
as strippers grind in b
g jordan parties with mark hanna and dozens of brokers and trainees
jordan sips a martini and studies mark hanna hitting on a stripper
that fall i passed my series
finally it was here
briefcase in hand jordan boards the elevator with a dozen other brokers
my first day as a stockbroker a future master of the universe
and as the doors close on screen we see october th total chaos
jordan dials the phone as all around him brokers panic screaming into headsets
they called it black monday
by four p
the market was down points the biggest one day drop since the crash of
the closing bell rings the entire place goes silent
brokers look at each other stunned
and as the brokers start commiserating with each other
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages l
rothschild a company that had been in business since closed its doors within a month
jordan sits at the table perusing the times classifieds
teresa approaches with two coffees
sits next to him
so ill take an extra shift dont worry about it
you work too much as it is
we could pawn my engagement ring
were not pawning anything
im gonna be a millionaire teresa
you know that doesnt matter right
he smiles kisses her
together they peruse the ads
points to an ad nobody beats the wiz
i could be a stock boy
youre a stock broker
no ones hiring brokers right now sweetie
they go back to the ads
after a few beats she points this place is
in a suit jordan emerges from an datsun
he looks around confused heads toward an unmarked storefront
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages the antithesis of l
rothschild with cheap furniture and a dozen misfit brokers giving loud obnoxious sales pitches
jordan enters a modern man among cave people
dwayne slovenly with a walrus mustache looks up
im looking for investors center
thats us hey
as they shake hands jordan belfort i called earlier
i was a broker with rothschild
dwayne motions jordan to a seat
nearby a broker in ratty keds toby welch is screaming into his phone
im tellin you this stock is goin up
cause i know okay
i have inside information
jordan looks at him appalled at what hes hearing
where are your quotrons
no quotrons we sell off the pink sheets penny stocks
dwayne slides jordan a large thin book its pages are literally pink
he explains as jordan flips the pages company dont have enough capital to be listed on nasdaq their shares trade here
points to the book like these guys aerotyne
they make radar detectors out of a garage in dubuque
six cents a share
who buys this crap
mailmen plumbers people thinking they can get rich quick
they answer our ads popular mechanics hustler
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages the spread on these is huge
sos your commission thats the point
blue chips stocks you get what one percent
pink sheets are fifty
wait a second
youre telling me if i sell two thousand dollars worth of stock my commission is a thousand bucks
technically yeah but not even the biggest schmuck buys two thousand dollars of this shit
as others brokers bark into phones jordan sits phone cradled in his shoulder making notes
a few beats then into phone mr
fleming good morning jordan belfort with investors center in new york city
you recently responded to one of our ads
a few of the other brokers glance over eavesdropping
the reason im calling is that an extremely exciting investment opportunity crossed my desk today
typically our firm recommends no more than five stocks per year this is one of them
a few more brokers look over
aerotyne international is a cutting edge tech firm out of the midwest awaiting imminent patent approval on a new generation of radar equipment
now all the brokers listen in rapt attention
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages so if aerotynes shares rise to only a dollar and our research indicates they could go much much higher your profit on
a mere three thousand dollar investment would be upwards of fifty thousand
thats right you could pay off your mortgage
seconds tick by an eternity then he starts writing four thousand dollars will that be check or money order
thank you sir
jordan hangs up scrawls out a buy ticket
just like that i made two grand
the other guys looked at me like id just discovered fire
toby welch and the other cave brokers stare at him
howd you fuckin do that
jordan sits at his desk in mid pitch totally focused
its a rock solid company sir its the next microsoft
as jordan continues talking wrapping up the sale
though i knew i was selling garbage within twelve weeks i was making a fortune
and as he starts scrawling out a buy ticket
and as a wise man once told me my only responsibility was to put meat on the table
close on a jaguar parked outside a diner
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages wearing a suit jordan sits in a booth reading the wall street journal as a waitress serves the food
donnie azoff preppy looking with horn rims and bright white teeth approaches from the takeout counter
that your jag in the lot
ive seen it around
we live in the same building
jordan nods what do you do bro
kids furniture me and my brother in law
making any money
seventy grand last month
get the fuck out
you made seventy grand in one month
seventy two actually
donnie studies him isnt sure if hes full of shit
tell you what
you show me a pay stub with on it im quitting my job right now and coming to work with you
as jordan retrieves his briefcase to find a paystub b as jordan hands donnie his paystub and sure enough its b north of seventy two k
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages holy shit
jordan watches as donnie crosses to a pay phone and dials
and he did quit his job which i thought was a little weird
i mean i had just met this fucking guy
a few beats then into phone yo paulie its donnie
yeah listen i quit
jordan studies donnie as he continues his conversation
there were other things about him too like his phosphorescent white teeth and the fact that he wore horn rims with clear lenses to look more waspy
he also married his first cousin jordan sits in mid conversation with donnie over beers
no problem if we have a kid whos a retard well just leave it on the steps of some institution
and as they continue drinking
he was also a closet drug fiend
id known him less than a week before he talked me into smoking crack
jordan and donnie get high
donnie holds a flame under a crack pipe
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages the weird thing was when hed do crack his face would contort into this bizarre frozen mask like the phantom of the
donnie does a hit of crack his jaw twitches then his facial muscles contort locking up like a stroke victim
after a few beats he hands the pipe to jordan
you now take a hit
jordan takes a deep hit and holds it
a beat then omigod i fuckin love you
i knew i had to make him my partner
jordan looks on as donnie works the phone like a madman
which turned out to be a great move donnie was a fast learner who transitioned into the penny stock business quickly
jordan and donnie pull up to a defunct auto body shop which has a for lease sign in the window
so within months we started our own firm out of an abandoned auto body shop
jordan sits with chester ming robbie feinberg alden kupferberg sea otter and brad muscular and bald with a fu manchu mustache
in addition to donnie i also recruited my friends sea otter chester and robbie who were at the time all middling pot dealers
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages as a waitress serves cheeseburgers see everyone wants to get rich so youre already half way there by the time the call
i sold weed once to this amish dude had one of those beards with no mustache
he only wanted to make furniture
whats that got to do with anything
he just said everyone wants to get rich
to jordan thats true you did
buddhists too they dont give a shit about money either
man i could sell weed to anybody get a convent full of nuns fucking wasted
and as brad looks at jordan and shakes his head we see the above guys working the phones
brad the guy i really wanted took a pass since hed become the quaalude king of bayside
bare chested wearing kung fu pants brad sells ludes to a couple of high school kids
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages they were absolute morons my friends but like i always said jordan emerges from his office into the garage area the bullpen
looking on as donnie chester robbie sea otter and four other brokers now including rugrat and toby make sales calls from the cheap desks
give me them young hungry and stupid and in no time ill make them rich
on lounge chairs at the edge of a dock bottle of wine nearby jordan sits with teresa
he smiles as she opens a jewelry case inside is a diamond tennis bracelet
you like it
jordan helps her try it on
she smiles but he detects a wave of
theyre small i know but the stones are really high quality
i love it
they sit in silence
finally i dont know its just these stocks these crappy companies
in five years the corleone family will be completely legitimate
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages why cant you be legitimate now
its not illegal teresa technically
i mean theyre real stocks theyre just
never gonna make anybody money
a few beats then wouldnt you feel better selling this junk to rich people who can afford to lose the money at least
rich people dont buy penny stocks
and on jordans look because theyre too smart thats why not
close on jordan brow furrowing as his wheels turn
i mean what person of any substance would trust this bunch of jerk offs
like the pinhead robbie feinberg
i mean look at this fucking cro magnon i wouldnt trust him to pick up a rock
i mean look at this fucking cro magnon he couldnt even think without moving his lips
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages or the sea otter
chester ming even the depraved chinaman with his giant panda head
or nicky koskoff who i called rugrat because well you can probably figure that out for yourself
the camera pushes in on jordan as he stands before a large dry erase board
but what if they didnt sound like jerk offs
what if i took this bunch of nincompoops and molded them in my own image
i reinvented the company gave it a new image a new name
something patrician blue blooded something that reeked of tradition and anti semitism
and as his brokers settle in to folding chairs gentlemen welcome to stratton oakmont
the clients weve gone after in the past theyre done
we will now target exclusively the wealthiest one percent of americans
the methods weve used over
loud obnoxious sales hype is worthless with these people
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages in military terms its like carpet bombing noisy menacing and only marginally effective
as stratton brokers you will be laser guided smart bombs aimed at high priority targets
you will establish an initial relationship with your clients selling only blue chip stocks then and only then will you attempt to sell the pink sheets where the real money
now the key to every sale is this jordan writes the word urgency on the board
no one buys stock unless he thinks its going up and going up now
you must convince your client to buy before the takeover happens before the lawsuit is settled before the patent is granted
if he says ill think about it and call you back its over youre dead
no one calls back
so you have to create urgency another day
with stratton oakmont signage visible in the b
jordan is on speakerphone with a potential client the other brokers listening in
and once kodak settles the lawsuit institutions will be permitted to buy their shares in large blocks again
and when that happens which is any day now what do you think will happen to the price of kodak stock
itll go up
which is why you should pick up shares today a investment
jordan stands addressing his brokers
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages then you lower your voice
jordan pitches the client his voice lowered
believe me sir you will not be sorry
jordan stands before the brokers
then you wait
whoever speaks first loses
at this point where are we in the sale
about to close
no you sweet and sour douchebag
were at the beginning of the beginning
this is where the sale starts
you as a salesman are almost hoping he says no so you can finally do your fucking job
jordan sits at the phone waiting for a response
i dont know i dont think so
jordan stands before the brokers
he doesnt know he needs to think hes gotta ask his wife
the fact is it doesnt matter what the fuck he says
if hes already agreed that the stocks going up then the only real objection he has at this point is he doesnt trust you
and he shouldnt trust you youre a fucking salesman
so what do you say
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages donnie talks on the phone to a client
let me ask you this sir had i been your broker for the past three to four years and made you money on a consistent basis you probably wouldnt say
you need to think about it youd probably say pick me up three or four thousand shares am i right
the place is crowded now brokers make up the sales force
sea otter pitches a client
wait a second
you mean to tell me if i put you in union carbide at and took you out at even more crowded with brokers
if i put you in texas instruments at and took you out at more brokers still now theres
walmart at and took you out at you wouldnt say chester pick me up shares
well yeah in that case i would
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages new offices now a real brokerage firm
the bullpen is large with brokers at polished maple desks sitting before computers talking into headsets
so the problem is that i dont have the luxury of a track record
sir let me reintroduce myself to you
my name is donnie azoff nicky koskoff chester ming peter deblasio from stratton oakmont in new york city and i plan on being the top broker in my firm this
so what about this
we start small with shares a cash outlay of
if the stock goes up will that make you a rich man
of course not
if if goes down will it make you a poor man
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages what this trade will do is serve as a benchmark for future business
the downside is minimal and the upside is a long term relationship with a broker on wall street who will consistently make you money
your only regret will be that i didnt call you six months ago
to robbie feinberg all right
to sea otter give me shares
to peter deblasio shares
to jordan ill take shares
pm the place goes nuts as jordan emerges from his office holding a spread sheet
he addresses the crowd of brokers which now includes a dozen women
everybody have a good week
applause war whoops
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages id like to read you something
reads spread sheet month end march
million in gross commissions all in stratton issues
not bad for penny stocks huh boys
not bad for dumpin penny stocks
the place goes wild with applause
and to celebrate with a weekly act of debauchery i have offered our lovely sales assistant danielle harrison ten thousand dollars to have her head shaved
jordan motions to danielle harrison pretty sitting in a chair nearby
behind her rugrat uses clippers to shave her thick brown mane
the place goes nuts
fyi danielle tells me shes using the money for breast implants
is this a great company or what
more wild applause as jordan signals across the bullpen to donnie
we hear the opening strains of stars stripes forever as he opens the door to a dressed in underwear and hats
the music continues as somersaulting gymnasts and baton twirlers bring up the rear
as they march through the bullpen to cheers from the kitchen two dozen tuxedo clad waiters emerge carrying trays of champagne and hors doeuvres
the music continues as two dozen strippers bolt in gyrating among the brokers
as jordan surveys the insanity word spread throughout wall street i was becoming a legend
forbes magazine even called to do a profile on me
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages jordan finishes up an interview with a female forbes reporter aliyah farran
they shake hands then he smiles for the camera click
a total fucking hatchet job
a gorgeous place city views
as teresa sits nearby a distraught jordan paces holding the copy of forbes
that conniving little twat
reading the wolf of wall street
on the bright side your hair looks good
jordan belfort a twisted version of robin hood who takes from the rich and gives to himself and his merry band of brokers
theres no such thing as bad publicity sweetie
bustling with activity
jordan enters crosses toward his office
off to the side of the bullpen he notices three dozen young men in business suits
he approaches his assistant janet s dressed all in black
the hells all this
the forbes article
theyre applying for jobs
they spot jordan start clamoring waving their resumes
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages forbes had made me a superstar
every day dozens of money crazed kids beat a path to my door with resumes they hadnt even bothered to spellcheck
jordan crosses through the packed bullpen where brokers no older than are crammed elbow to elbow talking into phones
some have pets which they tend to while they work iguanas snakes turtles even a chimp
others are getting shoulder rubs by masseuses or being fitted for suits by a tailor
over the above if we hired em they dropped out of college overnight and blew whatever allowance they had on a new suit from our in house tailor
the median age of our brokerage couldnt get served in the bar down the street
patrick denham sits sipping coffee as he reads forbes
not this guy though what the fuck is he even doing here
he read the forbes article too but he already had a job
close on two brokers wrestling while others cheer them on
pull back to reveal the place from the opening
young brokers and their hot assistants work the phones
within months we doubled in size moved to even bigger offices
two other brokers pump themselves up chest bumping and screaming like football players
it was a madhouse a greed fest with equal parts cocaine testosterone and body fluids
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages in a stall two brokers snort coke while another broker fucks a sales assistant perched on the sink
i had to declare the office a fuck free zone between the hours of and but even that didnt help
taped to the mirror we see a memo inside a red circle two anatomically correct stick figures fuck doggy style a red line slashing through them
actually the madness started on our very first day when one of our brokers ben jenner christened the elevator by getting a blowjob from a sales assistant
two dozen brokers cheer watching through the rising glass elevator as ben jenner gets a blowjob from a brunette sales assistant
her name was pam and to her credit she did have an amazing technique with this wild twist and jerk motion
as pam blows jordan donnie fucks her from behind
eventually ben married her which was pretty amazing considering she blew every guy in the office
a wedding photo of ben and pam
he got depressed and killed himself three years later
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages a crime scene photo ben in his underwear dead on a bathroom floor a gun near his head which oozes blood
anyway in an attempt to maintain order i hired my dad max as defacto cfo and head of the gestapo
max belfort sits smoking watching a rerun of the equalizer on tv
his wife leah does needlepoint
we called him mad max because of his hair trigger temper which could be set off by something as innocuous as a ringing telephone
the phone rings
who the hell has the goddamn gall to call this house on a tuesday evening
but then the weirdest thing would happen
though hed never been near england hed pick up the phone and affect an ever so slight british accent
greatly agitated max stomps toward the phone
this was his other persona the super polite ever gracious sir max
into phone hello
yes gene right eo
good good then
it was absolutely bizarre
hed hang up
hangs up phone goddamn fucking halfwit
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages and become mad max all over again
max curses a blue streak as he stomps back to his chair
holding a headshot of the dwarf from the opening jordan sits talking with donnie robbie and rugrat
what if he gets hurt
hell be wearing a helmet
plus theyve got like superhuman strength anyway
i did hear youre not supposed to make direct eye contact
if you look at them too long in their eyes they get freaked out their wires cross
i think theres a limit to how far we can go
i mean we can throw shit at him and they have a lot of feelings
theres a specific thing that theyll do you can throw him at a dart board but if you want him to show his cock or yes thats what this guy
thats his gift
can we also bowl with him
his brother is actually the bowler
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages they strap a skateboard to him and throw him down an alley
theyre ornery too the little pricks
you gotta be careful
get some tranq darts
a little straitjacket
whats the liability on something like this
thats a whole different thing
i can get on the phone with some people
i can talk to the insurance company and tell them exactly what were going to do
but i think we go back to the same plan loophole if we dont really consider them people i think we are in the clear
i think we should keep one in the office because i think theyre good luck
treat it like the fuckin thing it is
hes coming in
were paying him for something
treat him with respect
and you just shake his hand like you dont even think anythings wrong
you just look like something else is going on
you dont look at his eyes
say thank you for being here
you dont turn your back on him
its a sign of disrespect
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages if you want a cracker or something im gonna have some treats in my pocket

what is ej entertainment
restraining a grin you tell me dad
its a goddamn prostitution ring is what it is
jordan feigns shock turns to donnie did you know it was a prostitution ring
doesnt the irs allow for t a
its t e and stop fucking with me
what kind of hookers take credit cards anyway
jordan takes the bill starts flipping through it
in stratton parlance there were three kinds of hookers
there were blue chips the top of the line
they were priced between and and made you wear a condom unless you gave them a hefty tip which i always did
then came nasdaqs who were pretty but not great usually in the two to three hundred dollar range
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages finally there were pink sheets skanks the bottom of the barrel
they usually cost a hundred or less and if you didnt wear a condom youd get a penicillin shot the next day and pray your dick didnt fall off
not that we didnt fuck them too
believe me we did
behind him the other guys wait their turns
max continues to steam so jordan ushers robbie rugrat and donnie out the door
give us a minute will you guys
he closes the door then stretches a bit exaggeratedly letting out a little moan
whats the matter
my backs been killing me
pain shooting down my leg
not to worry itll pass
what do the doctors say
doctors what do they know
im on like twenty different medications
re the amex bill look i know its hard for you to make sense of these expenses but theres a method here okay
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages max waits to hear it jordan gestures to the bullpen and you have to lead by example is that it
jordan nods im tellin ya kid one of these days
one of these days the chickens are gonna come home to roost
in order to keep these guys working i gotta keep em spending
i need to keep them chasing the dream
you flash some cash they do the same
it keeps them motivated
pissing away money
thats what motivates you kids
i could afford to pay them more but then they wouldnt need me as much
and as long as they need me theyll always fear me
i know it sounds crazy
he turns and exits
jordan watches him go thinking
it was obscene in the normal world
but who wanted to live there
massive with an olympic size pool overlooking the beach
dozens of luxury cars parked outside
on a balcony jordan is mid speech in a bathing suit addressing the strattonites below teresa at his side
so enjoy yourselves you all deserve a celebration
cept for kimmie shes lazy and she steals
off laughter kimmie flips him the bird he blows her a kiss but everybody keep this in mind
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages as my friend donnie azoff says if you wanna party with the boys you gotta wake up with the men
monday morning i want you all looking razor sharp
cuz strattons got a few things on the horizon things thatre gonna take it right up into the fucking stratosphere
the crowd goes nuts
one broker lets loose a wolf howl and the crowd toasts jordan chanting his name
as jordan looks down smiling like a benevolent dictator fuck merrill lynch this way we become the underwriters
like an investment bank
gorgeous people dance drink snort coke
upstairs jordan plays pool with sea otter donnie robbie toby and rugrat assigning ludes with every pocketed ball
we do our own ipos and we will print money
eat like a bird shit like an elephant baby
they can take their harvard asses under our desks and suck our cocks
to rugrat how soon can you get the paperwork filed
super stoned cant we talk about this monday
its a simple fucking question
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages except im looking at three of you right now
weve got arncliffe national theyre looking to go public weve got very luded oh oh steve
m m madden
donnie gesticulates wildly
the guys crack up
we push in on donnie practically drooling as jordan gives us a quick tutorial on ludes
cut to extreme close up of guys doing drugs
the quaalude was first synthesized in by an indian doctor thats dot indian not feathers as a sedative and was prescribed to stressed housewives with sleep disorders
pretty soon someone figured out that if you resisted the urge to sleep for fifteen minutes you got a pretty kick ass high from it
didnt take long for people to start abusing ludes course and in the u
government schedule oned them along with the rest of the world
which meant there was only a finite amount of these things left
no shit you cant even find em anymore today
you peoplere all shit outta luck
to donnie whatre you saying buddy
to the others shhhh
listen to him
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages ssshhhhoes
jordan suspects donnie may actually be onto something
but just then
jordan peers over the balcony where sea otters looking
the hottest blonde ever has entered the party with her date blair
she smiles full lips parting over perfect white teeth a ridiculously short dress barely covering her long tan legs and full breasts
my nutsacks about to explode
someones gotta take that down
theres no debate who that someone should be
eyes locked on naomi jordan makes his way downstairs
with naomi taking in the party her eyes flitting to things art chandeliers crystal etc
a lotta people would look at me and think golddigger shes out to land the richest husband she can
but you see i came from nothing
like below the poverty line
and when you come from nothing being rich means never having to go back to that
jordan approaches cristy s one of his guests
he smiles cristy picks up his intent have you met my friend naomi
jordan takes naomis hand doesnt let go
you have an awesome house
i dont think ive ever been in a house like this
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages you like it
i just got it
i guess its okay
six bedrooms two hot tubs one off the master suite overlooking the water
you like to jet ski
naomis date blair offers his hand to break them apart
toby welch lurks behind him giving him the evil eye
jordan barely acknowledges him focused on naomi
outside hildy azoff chats with teresa
her eyes stray to jordan chatting up naomi
teresas eyes follow hers and sees them
youre telling me youve never jet skied in your life
yknow we really should hit it theres two other parties were sposed to get to what
you just got here
naomi looks like shed like to
hildy approaches introduces herself then jordan teresa needs your help
i dunno youll have to ask your wife what she wants
jordan sees teresa is watching from afar
oh sweet jesus
jordan turns to see a drunk donnie cock in hand jerking off to naomi
hildy comes running over
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages donnie
what the fuck are you doing
during the melee that follows hildy admonishing donnie blair removing naomi from the party the day i met naomi was the day i truly became the wolf
every guy wanted her so i had to have her
jordan watches her go
naomi shoots a glance back to him and like that hes hooked
over a bottle of lafite jordan sits in mid conversation with naomi who is stunning in a low cut black cocktail dress
thats near staten island
brooklyn across the verrazano bridge
my dads side
also dutch german english im a mutt
actually i have family over there in london
my aunt emma
that explains it then
smiles youre a duchess
the duchess of bay ridge
naomi smiles flags a passing waiter
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages could i have a straw please
the waiter nods heads off
a few beats then so i was a little surprised you asked cristy for my number
arent you married
married people cant have friends
the waiter brings the straw
she opens it slips it in her red wine glass
off jordans look so i dont stain my teeth
and as she sips the wine seductively through the straw
jordans ferrari makes its way over the bridge heading back toward brooklyn
then at night i do my designs
jordan drives naomi next to him
an entire line of lingerie camisoles bustiers panties
jordan glances over her dress is riding up her thigh
she designs panties
jesus fucking christ
sounds like something i might invest in
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages well we should definitely keep in touch then
he pulls over outside her brownstone
think jordan think
how can you get up to her apartment
they look at each other
we can almost hear jordans heart pounding
you wanna come up for some tea
a small cozy apartment
naomi enters jordan close behind
she picks up rocky her yapping maltese
say hi rocky
naomi waves rockys paw
why dont you light a fire
ill be right out
jordan nods takes in her scent as she walks away
god please help me
how can i fuck this girl
as he crouches by the fireplace his skypager vibrates
he checks the readout teresa
his face falls as he hits the silent button mind racing with guilt
thats it youre leaving
youre going home to your wife
jordan stands turns around naomi is in the doorway naked except for high heels
as you can probably guess i fucked her goddamn brains out
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages rocky yaps incessantly as jordan pounds away atop naomi
for eleven seconds
jordan cums loudly convulsively
im sorry i did you cum
nods gasping yeah but im still hard
jordan looks down at her
being inside her
was like your cock went to heaven and god himself was cupping your balls
and as they start fucking again
jordan sits at his desk telephone to his ear
i couldnt get enough
close on naomi who talks on the phone smiling
we pull back to see the apartment is packed with flowers
every chance we got wed sneak off together
giggling like a child jordan pours coke from a vial creating a little mound atop one of naomis breasts
hold still dont move
to the driver watch the potholes
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages more giggling then he snorts the coke off her breast burying his face in it as he climbs on top of her
naomi laughs uncontrollably as the limo glides to a stop
the door opens from outside the doorman
get out of the fucking car
jordan looks up locks eyes with teresa
he jumps off naomi stumbles out closing the door behind himself
what are you doing home
that whore from the party
how could you do this to me
the limo takes off
teresa starts crying
i thought you were at the beach house i i married you when you had nothing teresa
i dont know what to say
youre like a totally different person
i made a mistake okay
tell me you dont love her
off his silence jordan
jordan says nothing
finally teresa starts sobbing
i felt horrible
jordan holds her letting her cry
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages three days later i filed for divorce and moved naomi into the apartment
completely remodelled all new furniture
jordan and naomi sit at the table set for a candle light dinner
say what you will but the duchess did have style
she brought in a decorator feng shuid the place she even hired a gay butler
nicholas the butler s enters with hot towels on a silver tray
thank you nicholas
jordan takes a towel wipes his face
he was smart sophisticated really great
except for that one time
a gay orgy is in progress a dozen naked men including nicholas in various sexual positions about the room
jordan sits across from a very shaken naomi
he must have thought i was at my mothers
where were they
in the bedroom
they were right here
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages a beat then jordan realizes
he jumps off the couch like its on fire
it gets worse
after i chased them out i checked the apartment
the motherfucker stole fifty grand in cash and jewelry
with nicholas seated in a chair jordan sits across from him
pacing behind him is donnie coked up face contorted frothing with rage
nearby giant chester ming sits quietly saying nothing
i just want my stuff back okay
i didnt take anything
in his face i should kill you cocksucker
you do not fuck with this man
jordan holds donnie off
turns back to nicholas
you were high things got out of control i get it
believe me i do i have a phd in debauchery
i didnt do it
ill knock your fuckin teeth out motherfucker
just give me the money give me the jewelry and well forget the whole thing
its because im gay isnt it
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages nicholas
you could fuck a baby sheep as far as i care on my brand new fucking sofa
what i wont stand for is being robbed
im telling you the truth
ill ask you one last time
youre dead you piece of shit
jordan nods to chester
without a word he crosses to nicholas and bammm
nicholass nose splits open like a ripe plum blood spurting everywhere
tough guy donnie takes one look then spews vomit into a garbage pail
and as chester pummels nicholass face into chopped meat
its amazing the kind of loyalty money will buy
i mean chester almost killed this prick
chester starts to hang nicholas over the balcony by his legs
jordan stops him
i finally called the cops mainly to save nicholass life
with the bloodied nicholas in the background jordan talks to two nypd cops handing them each a wad of cash
i gave them each a thousand bucks and told them what nicholas had done
then they kicked his ass
as the cops swat nicholas with their nightsticks fuckin thief huh
piece of shit
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages and as they hustle nicholas out
loyalty like i said
which was the key component to my incredible fucking success
as jordan golfs with donnie chester robbie toby and some hookers brad pulls up in a golf cart with a cash filled gym bag
besides brad i had eight other ratholes close friends whod own stock on paper but kick the profits back to me after i drove the price through the roof
they hug then jordan adds the gym bag to several others on the back of his golf cart
donnie tries to befriend brad brad isnt interested
the sec knew i was doing something shady but they couldnt figure out what the fuck it was
jordan max and securities lawyer manny riskin exit the kitchen with coffees
im telling you piss on the secs leg youll end up with your tits in a ringer
freeze frame manny stuffs a cruller into his mouth
my securities attorney manny riskin
seven hundred an hour to be the voice of doom
its under control
will you relax already
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages just then max spots a broker break dancing as three other brokers look on
what the fuck is this imbecile doing
max crosses off starts screaming at the break dancing broker
jordan keeps walking with manny
the sec sent two lawyers down to review our files so i set them up in our conference room
jordan passes the conference room looks in the window two sec attorneys wear coats as they review documents
then i had it bugged and the air conditioning locked till it felt like antarctica in there
one of the sec attorneys blows into his hands for warmth
manny follows jordan toward the bullpen his frenzied brokers working the phones
so here they were looking for a smoking gun while i was firing a bazooka right under their noses
it was our first ipo and we were driving the stock price to the fucking moon
arncliffe national its on fire
voice lowered believe me your grandkids will thank you
to sales assistant arncliffe national ten thousand shares
jordan speaks directly to camera as he continues walking through the bullpen
see an ipo is an initial public offering the first time a stock is offered for sale to the general population
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages as the firm taking the company public we set the initial price then sold those shares back to stops then you know
what youre probably not following what im saying
the question is was it legal
but we were making more money that we knew what to do with
alone in a private room jordan unloads a small suitcase filled with stacks and stacks of hundred dollar bills
but i figured it out
close on a huge diamond engagement ring
jordan is down on one knee proposing naomi hyperventilates as he puts the ring on her finger a seven carat yellow canary diamond in a platinum setting
i held my bachelor party at the tangiers in las vegas one last blowout for the gods before i settled down for good
inside a jumbo jet a wild mid air party is in progress
a hundred strattonites flew in with fifty hookers and enough drugs to open a pharmacy
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages various images stratton brokers drink do coke a half dozen in mid orgy with hookers naked in the aisle as others pour
champagne on them
all told the weekend cost me almost two million dollars the tangiers presidential suite is a shambles on the level of hiroshima
a giant crystal chandelier lays shattered on the floor jordan asleep in the massive bed a blue chip hooker on either side of him other passed out bodies lay amid
debris and broken toppled furniture
but the wedding was like something out of a fairy tale gorgeous tropical
hundreds of family and friends janet toby welch peter deblasio and kimmie belzer look on as jordan and naomi walk up the aisle
with naomi my duchess me her handsome duke and the bahamas ocean club our castle
jordan and naomi waltz their guests joining in
of course after that bachelor party the duke needed a few penicillin shots so he could safely consummate the marriage
as jordan and naomi mingle with a few strattonites videographer barry kleinman s approaches rugrat and his date abby with a video camera
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages im barry kleinman filming the wedding would you like to say something to jordan and naomi
we love you
across the way naomi spots someone through the crowd omigod
naomi rushes over hugs her aunt emma s demure british
naomi turns calls out to jordan who is now in a huddle with the guys his back to her
jordan turns then crosses to them smiling
jordan dear how lovely
its so nice to see you again
as he leans in to hug her aunt emma spots some white powder on the edge of jordans nostril
deftly she wipes it off smiling
into the donuts i see
oh im uh
aunt emma leans in to his ear
i lived through the s my dear
enjoy the day
and with that she turns back to naomi
with naomi wearing a blindfold jordan leads her to the end of a long dock expensive yachts moored everywhere
jordan removes her blindfold there towering above the others is a stunning foot yacht
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages what is this
your wedding present
check out the name
she does its called naomi
as she squeals hugs him for three weeks we sailed the naomi through the caribbean the camera pushes in past a white jacketed steward who opens the door to the
yachts main salon next we see the living room with its full bar and leather couches then the bedroom with a king bed and monogrammed sheets
eventually taking her home to long island where wed bought a house
the naomi sails the calm waters jordan and naomi popping ludes sunbathing blissfully on the deck
seven acres on the gold coast of long island various shots the massive house the glistening pool waterfall fountains tennis court driving range gazebo gym sauna library media room
the most expensive real estate in the world with maids cooks landscapers you name it
l we see the household staff lined up outside the house
l we even had two guards who worked in shifts both named rocco
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages amid billowing piles of white chinese silk jordan sleeps on his back snoring blissfully
it was heaven on earth
on screen we see splash
a glass of water hits him in the face
wake up you bag of shit
soaking wet jordan sits upright to see naomi standing over him in a tiny pink chemise holding an empty glass
the fuck are you doing
who is she
some little hooker you fucked last night
and as naomi storms off for a re fill
jordan lies on the ground hands tied with a lit candle up his ass
venice where are you
venice a blue chip hooker enters pulls out a candle and straddles him
she drips wax on his back and pulls his hair
back to scene
naomi holds another full glass rocking back and forth on the balls of her feet like a fighter
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages you were calling her name in your sleep
i can explain everything
more lies from the man who lies for a living
donnie and me were investing in a condo development in venice
duchess come on
dont duchess me you scumbag
you think i dont know what youre up to
youre a father now and you act like an infant
she nails him again crosses for more water
why are you so mad
where do you want me to start
how about you flying in here on your stupid helicopter at three in the morning waking up skylar
jordan crash lands the helicopter on the driving range
he exits gives captain dave a salute fights his way through the bushes then stumbles toward the house and falls into the pool stoned out of his skull
security floodlights come on and the alarm sounds
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages does it even matter to you that i just had that driving range sodded with bermuda grass
back to scene
naomi holds another glass of water
but why should you give a shit
youre not the one who researched the fucking thing and dealt with the fucking golf course people
youre an aspiring landscape architect
but what happened to wine connoisseur
oh wait that was last month
naomi winds up with the water glass
jordan stands tall puffs himself up arms flexed at his sides
stop flexing your arms you look like a fucking imbecile
re his crotch and dont think that impresses me much
jordan looks down he has a morning erection
i wasnt flexing my arms
youre just lucky to have a husband whos in such great shape
now get over here and kiss me
she nails him one last time then storms out
he stands there dripping wet
to his erection where the fuck were you last night
my morning ritual
first id get up and fight with naomi about whatever i did the night before
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages jordan stands in the steaming shower
next it was a steam so i could sweat out whatever drugs were still in my system
jordan looks at himself in the mirror
his eyes are bloodshot he looks like shit
after that id assess the damage
jordan looks at a visine bottle recommended dosage two drops
he squirts six drops in each eye
what kind of maniac abuses eye drops
fully dressed and standing amid hundreds of suits jordan pops two white pills swigs some juice
then id get dressed take my back pills to get me started then attempt to make up with her
jordan enters the tiny pink wonderland
on the fluffy pink carpet is naomi now in a minidress hiked above her hips manolo blahniks showing polished red toes
between her legs sits skylar their month old daughter
little girl voice good morning daddy
wheres my kiss
jordan kisses the baby picks her up
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages playing along does daddy get to kiss both his girls
daddy doesnt even get to touch mommy for a very very long time
naomi lays back on her elbows thighs parted shes wearing no panties
the wind goes out of jordan
cmon nay please
you know how sorry i am
i swear i cutting him off daddy shouldnt waste his time
and from now on its going to be nothing but short short skirts around the house
and mommys so sick and tired of wearing panties uhhh
in fact shes decided to throw them all away
parting her thighs so take a good look
youll be seeing an awful lot of it around the house but no touching
she licks her lips seductively
jordan sets skylar aside starts grovelling
whats wrong daddy
naomi slips her index finger in her mouth starts sucking it
jordan can barely speak
cmon why are you doing this
i said im sorry
pouting ohhhh poor poor dada
he loves to say how wrong he is when hes ready to come in his own pants
isnt that right dada
mommy loves daddy so so much and theres nothing she wants to do more right now than to make love to daddy all day long
well i guess its time for daddy to be taught his first lesson
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages naomi runs her fingers over her stomach and on to her inner thigh then up toward her vagina
jordan watches transfixed then a change comes over him
i wouldnt do that if i were you mommy
i think mommy should hear a story before she decides to please herself like that
can daddy tell mommy a story
off her nod and does mommy promise to keep her legs spread wide wide open the whole time
she nods dreamily good
once upon a time there was a great big mansion in long island and the people who lived there had lots and lots of money
but of all the possessions they had there was one thing that was much more valuable than all the rest combined and that was their little baby daughter
naomi listens legs still spread hand on her crotch
now because he was very security conscious the daddy hired two full time guards big hairy men both named rocco and they installed security cameras all around the house
and one of those cameras is right over daddys shoulder
naomis eyes widen she look toward a teddy bear on a shelf
we see that one of the eyes is a pinhole camera
so smile mommy
youre on candid camera
mesmerized rocco day watches a video screen on which we see a grainy image of naomi hand between her legs
naomi jumps up as if shes been electrocuted
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages as she bolts from the room jordan plays with skylar
the good thing about living with a world class ballbreaker is they make all the other ballbreakers in your life a little easier to take
donnie stands talking with jordans assistant janet
jordan approaches under a head of steam
there he is
a quick hug then steve here yet
on his way
cuz we have a problem
he indicates out to the bullpen
donnie and janet look
incredulous is he wearing a bow tie
in the bullpen we see a young stratton broker in a bowtie cleaning a small goldfish bowl on his desk
hes got nothing better to do on the day of the biggest ipo in this firms history
jordan watches as donnie marches toward the broker in a bowtie
the fuck you doing
bewildered cleaning my fishbowl
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages donnie nods turns to go but suddenly he turns back and thrusts his arm in the bowl grabbing for the squirming goldfish
the broker in a bowtie looks on horrified
on new issue day
on cocksucking motherfucking new issue day
dozen of brokers and sales assistants look over as donnie snatches up the fish
holding it by its tail he jumps up on the desk of the broker in a bowtie
now the entire bullpen looks over
this is what happens when you fuck with your pets on new issue day
with the flair of a showman donnie pops the fish in his mouth swallowing it whole
the brokers cheer wildly
donnie jumps down gets in the face of the broker in a bowtie now take your bowtie get your shit and get the fuck out
bowtie is stunned
and as donnie storms off we push in on jordan watching from across the room
jordan finishes a phone call as donnie enters with steve madden s dressed in wrinkled navy blazer cargo pants and t shirt a baseball cap over his scraggly thinning hair
jordan smiles crosses to greet him
ready to get rich
and as they ad lib greetings settle in at the couch steve madden the shoe designer was a childhood friend of donnies but i didnt hold that against him
remember those ads those giant headed girls with bug eyes wearing those big clunky shoes
a insert a quick series of steve madden ads
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages he came to me a few years earlier when he was just starting out so i became a silent partner in his
company buying an stake for only a million bucks
we see various stores all packed with teenage girls buying shoes and boots
the company blew up and we were now taking it public
it was the biggest deal wed ever done and the hottest ipo on wall street
jordan and donnie sit with steve madden in mid conversation
which is why they need to meet you
you gotta get em fired up so theyll push the shit out of this stock
let them feel your passion
bustling with activity
with jordan and donnie looking on from nearby steve madden approaches a microphone on the raised platform in his hands several shoe boxes
into mic uhhh
the place slowly comes to order
for those of you who dont know me my name is steve madden
im we know who you are
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages steve clears his throat looks over at jordan hes terrified
jordan motions for him to calm down
i uh id like to start by telling you about my background in the shoe industry
nice fucking hat
first started working in the shoe industry in a shoe store
when i was sixteen my friends were out chasing girls but i was learning about womens shoes
move the mike closer
we cant fucking hear you
he moves the mic feedback screeches through the bullpen
anyway my first job was at a shoe store like i said where i worked in the stockroom
you know i can honestly say ive been a lover of womens shoes since i was twelve freak
not like that
i mean somehow i became fascinated with the endless design possibilities for womens shoes queer
get a fucking life
steve looks at jordan who motions for him to speed up
he grabs a shoe from one of the boxes
this shoe the mary lou is the one that really put me on the map
its a black patent leather variation of the mary jane but splat
a half eaten grapefruit lands at steves feet
in a flash jordan rushes over grabs the mic
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages all right lets hear it for steve madden and the wonderful mary lou
huge applause with stomping feet howling etc
okay now that you got that out of your system i want you to know why steve is so completely off the fucking wall
its because this man is a creative genius
steves power his gift is that he creates trends
artists like steve come along once a century
who knows how high this stock could go
applause war whoops
jordan motions for quiet
i want everybody to look down
see that little black box in front of you
its called a telephone
now im gonna let you in on a little secret about this telephone it wont dial itself
thats right until you take some action its nothing more than a worthless hunk of plastic like a loaded m without a trained marine to pull the trigger
and in the case of the telephone its the action of you a highly trained strattonite a killer who will not take no for an answer
a person who will not hang up the phone until his client either buys or fucking dies
the brokers go crazy
jordan looks around
i dont care if you graduated from harvard or bumfuck university or never got past fourth fucking grade
that phone is the great equalizer
pause looks around there is no nobility in poverty
ive been rich and ive been poor and i choose rich every time
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages at least as a rich man when i have to face my problems i show up in the back of a limo
wearing a suit and gold watch
jordan takes off his gold watch flings it to the crowd
brokers go nuts fighting over it like a home run ball
and if anyone here thinks im crazy get the fuck out and get a job at mcdonalds because thats where you fucking belong
but before you depart this room full of winners i want you to take a good look at the person next to you because one day in the not so
distant future youll be sitting at a red light in your beat up old pinto and that persons gonna pull up in a brand new porsche with their gorgeous young wife at their side
and who will you be next to
some ugly beast with three days of razor stubble in a sleeveless moo moo crammed in next to you with a carload of groceries from the fucking price club
he scans the brokers theyre on the edge of their seats
so you listen to me and listen carefully
are you behind on your credit card bills
pick up the phone and start dialing
is your landlord threatening to evict you
pick up the phone and start dialing
does your girlfriend think youre a fucking loser
pick up the phone and start fucking dialing
i want you to deal with your problems by becoming rich
i want you to go out and spend money
leverage yourself back yourself into a corner let the consequences of failure become so fucking unthinkable that youll have no choice but to do whatever it takes to win
the brokers go absolutely apeshit
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages you have an obligation here people
to your clients
to this firm
an obligation to yourself godammit
you ram steve madden stock down your clients throats and make them choke on it till they buy shares
be telephone fucking terrorists
before jordan is even finished the brokers go berserk some already dialing their phones
we opened the stock for sale at
by it was over eighteen dollars
agent denham exits the elevator arriving for work
he strides between cubicles briefcase in hand
he enters where pinned up on one wall is a massive chart on strattons operations pictures of jordan donnie and others a hierarchy a history an investigation
total sales frenzy
the camera pans the brokers who work the phones like mad
the hottest new issue on up two dollars while im wall street
talking to you
and as we continue panning the room
of course i couldnt have done this without help
id leaked the word on wall street that stratton was a buyer up until twenty
so not only were we pushing madden all the big firms were too
we continue panning the frenzied brokers
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages as long as they knew id buy the shares back at the top of the market theyd drive the price up as
high as i fucking wanted
donnie pours champagne nearby oblivious to jordan who sits at his desk speaking directly to camera of the two million shares being offered for sale a million belonged to me
held in phony accounts by my ratholes
once the price hit the high teens i jordan abruptly stops
a beat then like i said before who gives a shit
as always the point is this back to scene donnie hands jordan a glass of dom
million in three fucking hours
they toast then each pop ludes which they wash down with champagne
a quick knock janet pops her head in
call for you
barry kleinman from future video
he filmed your wedding
he says its urgent
curious jordan leans over hits the speaker phone barry
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages barry kleinman sits at his desk talking on the phone

hes hoping it rattles you or maybe your wife so that she starts nagging you to turn witness
thats laughable what
he wants me to rat on myself
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages shrugs good news is i made some calls dea justice
no one but him even knows who you are
can you bug him or something tap his phone
first off you dont fuck with these guys not that way
secondly i got a p
license you know
maybe i should call him see what he wants
anybody does that should be your lawyer
what you do is eat your dinner drink your drink and forget about it
cuz as far as i hear he doesnt have shit
jordan nods wheels turning pretending to do as told
as agent denham steps into frame another fed agent hughes beside him both g man stoic in impenetrably dark glasses patrick
they look up
on the yacht naomi jordan stands waving drinking wine with two blue chip hookers in bikinis
planks right down there
denham shares a look with his cohort its almost a joke this display of wealth before a federal agent
moments later they step aboard
belfort im agent denham
this is agent hughes
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages heya
this is nicole and um
girls patrick and
agents denham and hughes
your message said you wanted to speak privately
off denhams stare oh theyre just friends
to the girls give us a minute okay
the hookers head below deck
jordan shoots denham a wink check out that ass
can i get a glass
got wine open or any kinda booze
shrimp and lobsterre over there if youre hungry
bureau forbids us from drinking at sea
jordan surprised the guy has a sense of humor
i have something for you i just gotta find it
have a seat will ya
ever been on one of these before
as jordan rifles through some papers denhams eyes scan the deck casually cataloguing everything
learned to sail when i was six
i mean one like this
just had her extended to put a chopper on the back
jordan points out the bell jet helicopter
never been on a boat with a second mode of transportation on top of it
jordan finds the file hes been looking for offers it
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages before hell accept what is this
names and addresses of every guest at my wedding
i even threw in the seating chart
heard thats why you wanted the video figured thisd expedite whatever it is youre doing
denham looks its indeed a guest list from the wedding i wanted to show you ive got nothing to hide
i know youre investigating stratton but for the life of me i cant figure out why
sure my company is unorthodox what brokerage isnt
maybe were a little louder than most but we dont do anything illegal
talk to the sec theyll tell you they checked us out up and down
the secs actually a civil regulatory agency
we pursue criminal activity
thats what im saying
you guys take on real crime
which is why im so curious what do you think we did
the reason jordan asked him here denham realizes
i cant discuss ongoing investigations
though to be frank this case kinda got dumped on my desk
some higher up felt your shop needed looking into after all that press fell on me to do the looking
you know who you should be looking at
goldman lehman brothers merrill
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages what those guysre up to with collateralized debt obligations
this internet stock bullshit
if you want ill walk you through exactly thatd be great
and if theres anything you can give me just to close out your file get it off my desk sure get you back to the real criminals then we could
both profit from this little sit down
jordan sizes him up what did denham mean by profit
you sure you dont want anything to drink
water for your pal
denham demurs rumor is your started out in finance
even got your brokers license before you joined the bureau
who told you that
searches his memory jeez who was it
comes up short ever regret it
giving up the money crazed pin striped life
ever think where youd be if youd stuck with it
when im riding the subway home sweating my balls off in a suit ive worn three days sure
whattaya pull in working at the bureau if you dont mind me asking
k a year
we get a free handgun out of it though that doesnt suck
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages scrazy the world we live in the jobs with real value the ones we should appreciate firefighters teachers fbi agents those are
the ones we pay the least
way of the world
thats one thing i like about what i do the opportunity to make that right
take this kid we had interning last year
didnt want to be a broker wanted to be an environmental scientist or something he had a student loan debts up to his eyeballs
anyway his mom gets sick all they can afford is third rate care
some of us got together made an investment on his behalf and boom overnight everything changes shes seeing the best doctors in the country
sadly didnt work out she passed but still having the power to do that makes all the other bullshit worth while
as denham considers that see its all about proper guidance pat
knowing someone with the right relationships whos discreet
i can change a life almost every day
they measure each other
how much that intern make off your deal
north of half a million
denham summons agent hughes over
to jordan can you say that again what you told me
jordan declines with a smile to agent hughes i believe mr
belfort just tried to bribe a federal officer
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages what
i was making conversation
sounds like that to me jordan
no no no
sounded like that
no to constitute a bribe dont i have to make an explicit offer of money for services
with an exact dollar figure attached
all i said was north of half a million
according to the u
criminal code that dog wont hunt pat
then heard you were a straight arrow
that you wouldnt bend the rules other agents might
he was right
you did a background check on me
figured you were looking into me was only fair
plus you sail on a yacht fit for a bond villain sometimes you gotta act the part
this is why you invited me down to your yacht
with a couple hookers on it those are friends to get a sense of the guy who was coming after you
jordan puts his hands up you got me
thanks for coming down
now get off my boat
you know most of the wall street jackasses i bust they were born to the life
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages their father was a douchebag before them and his father before that
but you you got this way all on your own
good for you jordan
as he starts to go thank you for having us
im absolutely certain well see each other again
before he does you know this is about the nicest boat ive ever been on
just think what a hero ill be in the office when the bureau seizes it
jordan watches him go temper flaring he cant let denham get the final word
he calls after them hey denham
im gonna eat a claw of lobster now as i get my cock sucked by heidi down below
you have a super ride home on the subway thinking about that
as he watches them pull away seething he was a numbers guy a follow the fucking moneyer
he wasnt gonna come at me through my guys looking for a weak link and a quick kill
he was gonna come at me like an accountant would the way ness got capone through my books
it was ass covering time
as naomi looks on months pregnant jordan packs a suitcase
what the fuck is in switzerland
swiss cheese naomi what do you fucking think
jordan sits talking with rugrat and donnie
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages rugrat set up a meeting with a swiss banker he knew from law school who could launder our money but it wasnt
till noon the next day
jordan glances at his watch washes down a few ludes
i knew if i timed my lude intake right id sleep through the entire overnight flight
jordan stands before the bullpen talking to his brokers
at four p
i popped a few ludes which started kicking in by the time i finished our sales meeting
this was the tingle phase
over dinner a visibly high jordan ravenously digs into his food as donnie and four blue chip hookers look on
by dinner i popped a few more on top of some cocktails and an valium or two
the slur phase
on the crowded dance floor jordan gets knocked around like a marionette saliva strung from his mouth
by eight thirty id done a few more and pretty much lost my motor skills
this was the drool phase
jordan is barely conscious as a hooker rides him
and by ten i didnt know who or what i was doing the amnesia phase
we boarded the plane just before midnight
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages jordan boards slurring drooling completely wasted
to a stewardess sweetheart
look at you
and as he hugs her then stumbles toward his seat
quiet morning sunlight bleeds through the window
jordans eyes flicker open
he yawns looks around tries to get up he cant move
he looks down sees six seat belts restraining his arms and legs
jordan looks over at donnie mouth agape asleep next to him
donnie wake up
untie me shitbag
you think this is funny
i didnt tie you the captain did
he almost tasered you
as passengers scream jordan wildly humps a stewardess the captain struggling to restrain him
this was fucking great
i hadnt laundered a dime yet and already i was under arrest
a pensive jordan sits mind racing
worse yet was the plastic baggie of ludes that donnied stuffed up his ass
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages jordan trades looks with donnie who shifts uncomfortably
but before he could even get a hemorrhoid jordan sits with two customs officers
the whole thing was quashed by our friend the swiss banker
which was lucky for me since so far id been able to keep agent fuckface unaware of the trip
another customs officer enters whispers something to the others
they shake jordans hand and he leaves
a limo pulls up at an office building
jordan emerges with rugrat and donnie
jean jacques saurel greets them
the lobby is ultra modernist
nicholas has told me so much
jordan jean jacques saurel
nice to make your acquaintance
this is some lobby you got
we gave our designer an unlimited budget and he exceeded it
you must tell me all about your adventure with the stewardess over coffee
they disappear upstairs
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages jordan rugrat and donnie drink coffee with saurel and one other swiss banker
its an impressive office with an enormous fish tank
we have a joke in america
heaven is a place where the police are brits the chefs are italian the car mechanics are german the prostitutes are french and the bankers are swiss
i never got it til now look at those fucking fish
come here little guy
yes we have the same joke here
only sometimes the english are chauffeurs and the chefs are french
the germans alas are always mechanics no one wants to grant them more authority than that
jordan not as impressed by the fish cuts straight to the point im curious about your bank secrecy laws
excusez moi jordan swiss custom requires ten minutes of idle chit chat before business can be discussed
a smile of course lets get down to it
what would you like to know
under what circumstances would you be obligated to cooperate with an fbi or u
justice department investigation
ca depend on what
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages whether america plans to invade switzerland in the coming months
want me to see if tanks are rolling down the rue de la croix
through jordans forced smile what im asking you swiss dick is are you going to fuck me over
i understand perfectly you american shitheel
the only way the banque real de geneve would cooperate with a foreign legal body is if the crime being pursued also happened to be a crime in switzerland
but there are very few swiss laws pertaining to your rumored improprieties
which is why mr
azoffs joke is most appropriate from a financial standpoint you are now in heaven and we welcome you
if the u
justice department or fbi or sec or irs sent us a subpoena it would become papier toillette
we would wipe our ass with it
unless it was an investigation into stock fraud which is a crime in switzerland
then youd have to cooperate
now hes impressed yes we would
assuming the account is under your name
however if it were in the name of a nominee of yours
they take each other in
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages was that yodeling i just heard or did you just say what i thought you said
as the meeting wraps up with handshakes jordans v
overwhelms saurels v
he was telling me to use a rathole
problem was sneaking a u
rathole into switzerland was a chance i couldnt take
what i needed was somebody with a european passport
naomis aunt emma answers the door
big smile sweating surprise
amid towering trees and horse trails a noticeably twitchy jordan walks arm in arm with aunt emma
so tell me about this plan of yours
id like us to go to switzerland tomorrow so you can open an account
ill fund it and ill pay you really well for your trouble
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages next month maybe you can fly to new york and we can start moving the cash
moving the cash
smiles i feel like a character in an ian fleming novel
its all quite racy isnt it
it is and its illegal too
of course if you ever got in trouble id come forward in two seconds say i duped you but even still
risk is what keeps us young isnt it darling
i like that attitude
promise me youll spend at least ten thousand pounds per month out of the account okay
chuckles i wouldnt even know how
i really do have everything i need
but i bet you dont have everything you want
how about a bigger apartment so your grandkids can sleep over
aunt emma notices that jordan is sweating fidgety
shall we sit
sure thatd be great
they sit on a nearby bench
after a while sometimes i wonder if you let money get the best of you dear
beat among other substances
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages its that obvious huh
its the height of summer and youve got the chills
im a drug addict emma
coke pills you name it whatever you got
sex addict too
laughs well there are worse things to be addicted to than sex
chuckles then why did i just tell you that
playful because im very easy to talk to
jordan looks at her
a few beats then as a matter of fact you are
my job you know its tough
i mean im not complaining its just the stress
all these people depending on me
millions of dollars at stake every day
i sometimes feel ive bitten off more than i can chew
youre a man with large appetites
jordan looks at her and smiles is she fucking hitting on me
i put it on myself
its hard to control the anxiety you know
its hard to learn to relax
to release the tension
she is hitting on me
jordan leans in closer casually slips an arm around her
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages exactly to release the tension
sometimes you gotta learn to do what comes natural in life huh
aunt emma pulls back slightly
is he fucking hitting on me
he leans in even closer kisses her then stability dear
you take care of my niece my love
and ill take care of everything over here
a beat ah once upon a time
jordan fucks naomi
theres a curious thunk thunk thunk
when i got home i realized there was no way aunt emma could smuggle that much cash by herself
i racked my brain for another person with a foreign passport
the beds covered with bundles of cash
every thrust of jordans another bundle plummets to the floor thunk
with mil in cash on the bed jordan and a stoned donnie watch as brad tapes stacks of cash to his wife chantalle a bombshell in panties bra and sneakers
bra had theese tape eez focking steeky
as brad keeps taping her up
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages as a successful drug dealer brad spent his winters in the south of france which is where he met his wife chantalle
a stripper of slovenian origin but born in of all places switzerland
take eet off bra had
shut up bitch
you beetch you focking douche a bag a
donnie cant help but start laughing at this

jordan looks on with brad donnie and now naomi
of the cash is still on the bed

the wolf of wall street buff revised pages what

brad asks jordan if they can speak in private
moments later in private jordan joins brad
dont make me deal with this fucknut okay
hes just high is all
i dunno if hes stupid or a junkie but hes a loose fuckin cannon
i dont trust him and i dont want him around me
i thought he was your best customer
i only sell to him cuz hes your friend
can you just do one trip for him
its asking a lot
ill meet him but i wont pick up
i have a limit of how much of that douchebag i can take
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages i can hear you motherfucker
donnie emerges from where hes been eavesdropping
im a douchebag
well whose fucking idea was it made us all this money
who fucking knew steve madden
so go fuck yourself a little
brad slaps donnie so hard across the face he goes down
the next day aunt emma flew to geneva two million in cash in her carry on
wheeling a small carry on suitcase aunt emma smiles at a customs agent who waves her through
which in the big picture was a drop in the swiss bucket aa on another day chantalle and her family parents aa brother his wife pass through customs on vacation
because the following month over the course of six round trips chantalle and her family smuggled in over twenty million without even a hiccup
with a cash filled suitcase on the table chantalle remembers a last fold of cash hidden inside her skirts lining
she laughs with saurel
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages brad waits by his range rover as donnies rolls careens into the lot
he emerges briefcase in hand
donnie starts doing spastic karate moves
is he high
sure looks like it
brad looks pissed and donnie starts laughing
actually hes dead sober
im just fucking with you man
jesus the look on your face
brad isnt laughing hey sorry if i got outta line the other day i was just that was the drugs talking

he doesnt you know i always kinda regretted you didnt come to work with us at stratton
itd be so cool having you around man
growing impatient yeah well
youd be one of us wed go out partying together you wouldnt have to dress like a mall rat guinea prison bitch all the time
donnie grins obviously still smarting from brads slap
brad just wants to take the money and be done
give me the money
a distance away a cop in a patrol car notices brad gesturing to donnie for his briefcase
he nudges his partner check this out
can i come over and help tape this to your wife
eez so focking steeky
take eet off bra hod
brad composes himself lest he kill the guy
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages im gonna give you a pass
im gonna give you a pass
youre gonna give me a pass
just gimme the money
youre gonna give me a pass
offers the case why dont you stick your pass up your slavic cunts pussy
that does it
donnie throws the case at him which opens on impact money spilling out
brad instinctively tries to contain it
and thats when the police sirens start
here comes the patrol car
with no time to get to his car brad takes off on foot bleeding briefcase in hand toward a video store where he stashes his
in the return box
brad drops to his knees briefcase at his feet
from a distance donnie peers around a corner to watch him get arrested knowing he fucked this up
donnie is seated at his desk freaking out and trying to figure out what to do
with a flourish donnie presents a bottle full of ludes
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages jord do i have a surprise for you
twenty real lemons
a retired pharmacist friend of mines been sitting on these the last years
you fucking serious
close on a lemmon quaalude pure white with trademark ridged edges
the lemmon was the holy grail of quaaludes outlawed since the s and three times as powerful as anything available today
for a quaalude addict it was like finding a chateau margaux
close on donnie gauging jordans excitement waiting for the right moment to admit his fuck up
id been saving these for a special occasion like a birthday or celebrating our money being out of the country
instead i thought id better use em to help break the news about brad
in his underwear jordan kneels over the toilet sticking his fingers down his throat to make himself vomit
that night i cleared my schedule and rid my body of anything that could fuck with my high
it was celebration time
he takes a box off the counter marked active enema
he squats and administers it
massive with a wet bar media center and full gym
giddy as kids on christmas jordan and donnie sit on the couch the bottle of lemmons before them
start with one see how it goes
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages my guy says ones all well need
excited they each pop a lude toast with hot sake
bored jordan and donnie sit on the couch watching family matters on tv
you feeling anything
glances at watch thirty five minutes
maybe weve built up a tolerance all these years
donnie shrugs they pop another wash it down with sake
with jordan running on the treadmill donnie pumps away on an exercise bike nearby
theyre both sweating
this is bullshit man
my fucking metabolisms pumping and i dont feel shit
theyre old maybe they lost their potency
donnie leans over picks up the bottle
reads the label
theyre fucking duds
he shakes out more pills two more apiece
as they pop them a very pregnant naomi descends the stairs now very pregnant
what are you two retards doing
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages nothing
a look then bo dietls on the phone
naomi heads back upstairs
jordan picks up the phone
bo hey whats up
bo dietl talks on his cell phone
i need to talk to you but not on this phone
why whats leave the house call me back from a pay phone you hear me
jordan pulls his lamborghini out of the driveway
the brookville country club was a wasp stronghold a straight shot down the road from my house
jordan pulls up exits the car in sweats flip flops and a t shirt
he hustles up a staircase into
jordan stands at a pay phone receiver to his ear
we hear it ringing then jordan
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages yeah im at a pay phone
whats going on
bo talks on his cell
your buddy brads in jail
oh jesus christ
what did he do
i dunno yet they arrested him in a shopping mall in long island this morning im finding out
but listen to me
more important than that
the guy denham i told you about the fed
hes got your phones tapped im pretty sure
home and office
donnie that piece of shit
im gonna kill him
that fat prick mother fucker
but listen to me
do me a favor please do not talk on the phone
did you try to bribe this fuckin guy
i didnt try to bribe anybody
i couldnt understand you
say that again
i zay i zint ty zoo bibe azybuzzy
are you fucking high
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages jordan cant respond
phone still to his ear his eyelids droop
drool spills from his slackened jaw
after fifteen years in storage the lemmons had developed a delayed fuse
jordans pov is hazy as he stares at his own reflection in the pay phone
it took minutes for the little fuckers to kick in but once they did pow
i had skipped the tingle phase and went straight to the drool phase
jordans pov the phone gets further and further away
actually id discovered a new phase the cerebral palsy phase
jordan hits the floor with a thud crashed out on his back
from the dangling phone we hear over phone jordan
do not get behind the wheel
just tell me where youre at ill send rocco
jordan lolls his head toward the phone tries to reach for it he cant
he lays there for a while then cmon stand up
he rolls onto all fours lifts a hand topples over
okay walking is off the list of options
all right what else is there
a brainstorm i can crawl like skylar
slowly jordan begins crawling like an infant to the top of the staircase
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages the lamborghini is parked at the bottom twenty steps down
he starts to crawl down the stairs stops
cant figure out how to do it
the kid makes it look so easy
an icy wind blows through his t shirt
think you motherfucker think
a few beats then wait ive got it
jordan slowly curls himself into a ball
i can roll
forcing himself over the edge jordan begins to descend the steps one at a time
thump thump thump
he loses control takes all the steps at once
thump thump thump thump thump thump
he lands with a crash on the asphalt drags himself up and into the lamborghini
ignition on jordan sits hunched over chin resting on the steering wheel
just then the car phone rings
with great effort he pushes the speaker phone button ello
jordan where are you
whazz a marra
its donnie hes totally out of control
hes on the other line with some swiss guy
jordans face reads horror
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages i cant understand you
just get home hurry
naomi clicks off
and as jordan puts the car in gear
they say god protects drunks and babies
i was praying the same held true for drug addicts
peering over the wheel like an old lady jordan slowly maneuvers the lamborghini down the dark road
i was less than a mile from home and drove slower than shit
jordan pulls up in the lamborghini shuts the ignition
somehow i made it alive not a scratch on me or the car
close on the tv where a popeye cartoon is playing
pull back to reveal skylar watching
as jordan staggers in naomi approaches
in the kitchen
phone to his ear and at least as stoned as jordan donnie stands at the counter
into phone zee money i wazza move izz to zwizzyland
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages having been just woken up jean jacques saurel sits up in bed phone to his ear a perplexed look on his face
what language are you speaking mr
with naomi looking on jordan staggers toward donnie like a drunk frankenstein
ge ozza zone
ge ozza iz
iz zoggin oo anzali
with all the strength he can muster jordan rips the phone from the wall throwing it skittering across the floor with a clang
what the fuck are you doing
wazza fuh is wrong wizzz oooo
i wuzz awwing to
jordan grabs him wazza mazzer
wazza yoo razy
skylar looks on from the next room crying as jordan tries to shake some sense into donnie
naomi crosses to skylar and rushes her out of the room
he nah zuppose zoo dalk on zee vone
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages fuck it
jordan releases donnie
donnie crawls into the dining room and starts shoving ham into his mouth in an effort to sober up
just then we hear a horrible gagging sound
donnie holds his throat as he falls backward choking taking out the entire glass kitchen table with a tremendous crash
naomi rushes back in
omigod hes choking
jordan do something
just then we hear the triumphant popeye fanfare jordan looks to the tv where popeye pours a can of spinach down his gullet
instantly his chest and arm muscles swell to five times their size
jordan goes to get his coke
he snarfs up two fat spoonfuls and like that his chest swells and he takes a deep breath and he dashes back to the rescue
jordan rushes back to donnie who is now blue
hes not breathing
jordan places his fingers over donnies artery
jordan kneels starts furiously pumping donnies chest breathing air into his lungs in rhythmic bursts
this stupid sonovabitch
all donnie ever did was fuck me up and now i had to save his life cause i took a cpr class when the baby was learning to swim
just for the record i want it noted not for a second did i even think about letting him choke to death even though it wouldve saved me an awful
lot of headaches
donnie still isnt breathing
jordan flips him over tries the heimlich we hear a crunch as he breaks donnies ribs
he flips him back over but hes almost completely blue
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages he wont come back
dont let him die
he has children
one last try
jordan takes a massive breath blowing as hard as he can into donnies lungs
donnies stomach distends like a balloon then suddenly a chunk of ham projects from his mouth and into jordans face
donnie coughs vomiting
and as he starts breathing again jordan exits and passes out on the living room couch
jordan opens his eyes
through his hazy pov we see violet the maid standing over him with two old brookville police officers as naomi attends to donnie in the background
sir we need to ask you some questions
jordan exits the house with the police officers
the lamborghini is totalled an absolute wreck
maybe i hadnt made it home okay
nodding out jordan drives the lamborghini like a maniac careening off parked cars and trees
it was an absolute miracle i wasnt killed and an even bigger miracle i hadnt killed anyone
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages a man steps up to get his mug shot taken but its brad not jordan
turn to the side
but they couldnt arrest me the cops had no proof id been behind the wheel
meanwhile brad did a few months in jail for contempt because he wouldnt rat donnie out
they never found his gun though so they finally had to let him go
jordan watches an instructor lead skylar on a pony
nearby naomi holds newborn parker
manny riskin and max stand beside jordan
youre a lucky guy jordan
legally ive never seen anyone slip a noose the way you do
christ youre lucky to be alive much less not in jail
i dont believe in luck
thats what all lucky people say
its time jordan
let me make a deal with sec
before your luck runs out
skylar waves from the pony and jordan waves back
what kind of terms
you plead guilty to a handful of securities violations stock manipulation high pressure sales tactics ticky tack shit like that
you pay a few million dollars in fines and in exchange the sec fucks off for all time
what happens there
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages youd have to walk away
let donnie take over
that one hurts now the fbis a different animal
they can still pursue you for criminal wrongdoing
but with you on the sidelines my guess is your best friend agent denhamll be left standing around with his dick in his hand
jordan digests that
you beat them jordan
sail into the sunset with your wife and kids while you can
god knows youll never have to work again
as jordan looks at his picture perfect family we hear the troops roar as jordan takes center stage
im sure many of you have been hearing rumors lately about me about the future of this firm and thats what id like to talk to you about today
a few beats then five years ago when i started stratton with donnie azoff i knew the day would eventually come when id be moving on
its truly with a heavy heart that i tell you that day is here
the place erupts in a chorus of no
jordan raises his hand for quiet
thank you for that and for your years of incredible loyalty and admiration
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages the point is though that under donnies leadership along with robbie feinberg and nicky koskoff moving into key management positions this place
is gonna be better than ever
a smattering of applause
jordan notices a few brokers gravely shaking their heads
and the fact that im gone wont stop me from giving donnie advice not that he needs any jumping in why would anyone in their right mind not follow jbs
donnie looks petrified hes used to being an offensive tackle not the quarterback
before i go theres something i want to remind you all and thats this stratton oakmont is bigger than any one person even me
you guys are stratton each and every one of you and that is why its sure to remain the best brokerage firm in the fucking world
thunderous applause spreads through the boardroom all brokers on their feet
we push in on jordan
see the very idea of stratton is that when you come here and step into this bullpen for the first time you start your life anew
you have a place here and no one can take that away from you
stratton oakmont is america
give me your tired and poor
the very moment you walk through that door and pledge your loyalty to this firm you become part of a family you become a strattonite
it doesnt matter who you are it doesnt matter where youre from
whether your family came over on the mayflower or on a fucking inner tube from haiti
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages more applause
jordan scans the young faces they worship him
in the crowd he finds kimmie belzer s
everybody here knows kimmie belzer right
hoots and hollers
he raises his hand for quiet
in case any of you werent aware of it kimmie was one of strattons first brokers one of the original twenty
now when most of you met kimmie you met her the way she is today a beautiful woman who drives a brand new mercedes a woman who lives in the
finest condo complex on long island
a woman who wears armani suits who spends her winters in the bahamas and her summers in the hamptons
but thats not the kimmie i met
the kimmie i met was broke a single mom on the balls of her ass
three months behind on her rent with an eight year old son
she came to me for a job and when i hired her she asked for a dollar advance so she could pay his tuition
and what did i do kimmie
you wrote me a check for
because i believed in you like i believe in each and every one of you
i love you jordan
as the brokers go berserk jordan stands basking in the adoration
he looks at donnie turns back to the crowd looks out at the faces
a change has come over him

yacht naomi aft deck day spring ea its celebration time
dozens of strattonites party drinking dancing snorting jordan at the center of it

they interrogated everybody it went on for months
it was total fucking harassment
various stratton brokers are deposed robbie rugrat peter deblasio sea otter chester ming
but not a single strattonite cracked
donnie and i were given strict instructions not to leave the country
so we took our wives to italy
each of us had a couple of million we needed to deposit anyway on a duffel bag full of money just resting on deck
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages this seemed the most civilized way to transport it overseas
on another bag this one brimming with bottles of pills bags of pot vials of coke
jordan and donnie cut up lines as a hostess serves bloody marys
can i get you anything else gentlemen
i have a rare condition that requires me to drink one of these every fifteen minutes
if you could set your egg timer id appreciate it
the blow is ready for inhaling
jordan and donnie are doing a you first no you first routine with a rolled up when a cell rings

steve will go cockless when he watches me turn his company into a penny stock
he hangs up sonovacunt
yelling below deck captain ted
start er up we gotta go home
the sight of naomi and hildy returning from their trip ashore stops him
because naomis weeping hildy consoling her
what the fuck
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages i got a call from cousin betty
aunt emmas dead
off jordans reaction as naomi weeps and laments the dearly departed she was so young so healthy etc
fucking heart attack
boom snap she was gone
shuffled off her mortal coil and twenty million dollars in a swiss bank account
jean jacques saurel sits at his desk calmly smoking as he talks on the phone
it is terrible
your aunt was such an elegant attractive woman
my condolences to you and your family
you must be no time for it thanks but where does this leave us in regard to her account
it goes into probate or what
not to worry jordan
your aunt before she died signed a document naming you as her successor
a sly grin well
not as of yet
and as they continue talking jordan pulls out a nautical map of the italian coastline i gotta say these swiss were sneaky motherfuckers
within minutes he made arrangements to set me up with a forger the best document specialist in geneva
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages thing was i had to get there in three business days to co sign on the account
jordan goes rapid fire
he yells captain ted

the wolf of wall street buff revised pages then we drive to switzerland so they dont stamp our passports

well thats fine
anything is possible
i mean well have to batten down the hatches just to be safe
could be a few broken dishes
a few broken dishes
isnt that great
lets go to monaco jordan captain ted and donnie rush down stairs
as the engine starts
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages the perfect storm
as the naomi tips at a degree angle a thick wall of gray water comes rising over her side slamming onto the bridge with a thunderous crash
well talk about your shitty vacations
six jet skis plummet off the deck into the raging sea
donnie and naomi stand on the bridge where captain ted beecham holds the ships wheel with both hands the radio blaring in the background
what the fuck is going on
jet skis just went overboard
the waves are twenty feet and building
cant you turn us around
well get broad sided and tip over
naomi turns to jordan furious with him
you happy now you piece of shit
were gonna drown
im a master diver
we will not drown i promise you
i got you baby
realizing shes probably right to donnie the ludes
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages what
get the fucking ludes
theyre below deck
theres like three feet of water down there
i cant die fucking sober
as donnie heads off what is he crazy
wheres he going
donnie retrieves the ludes
captain ted stares through his binoculars
donnie returns with ludes feeds to jordan and then himself
jordan grabs naomi
all at once the boat dips down at an impossibly steep angle until its pointing almost straight down
captain ted jams the throttle and the boat jerks forward rising up the face of a giant rogue wave which curls over the top of the bridge and
slowly painfully the boat pops up from beneath the water its helicopter ripping from the deck and crashing into the sea
into radio mayday
this is captain ted beecham aboard the yacht naomi
this is a mayday
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages we are going down at the head fifty miles off the coast of rome and we require immediate assistance
off to the side jordan watches as naomi their friends and the yachts crew members dance to blaring techno music
a small group of italian sailors cheer them on
the nice thing about getting rescued by italians is that the first thing they do is feed you and make you drink red wine
then they make you dance
jordan watches as the dancing continues then casually glances out a porthole where we see the distant lights of a plane making its way across the night sky
after a few beats the plane explodes a tiny flash of light
did you see that
that was the plane i sent for to come get us
i shit you not it exploded when a seagull flew into the engine three people killed
you want a sign from god well after all this i finally got the message
i had to make some fucking changes
jordan looking healthier than weve seen him thus far sits on the couch stacks of paperwork on the coffee table
after a few beats naomi enters from the kitchen
i gotta finish these balance sheets babe
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages well its there
so the kids are gonna start
jordan goes back to work
looks up at tv
watches for a bit
whats the single most important skill in life you can ever master
shot on s era video an ad intended for late night local tv
the defining idea here is that while the commercial may be amateurish jordan isnt hes an excellent salesman even if the ad is cut rate
we start with flashes of the seminar jordan in front of a dry erase board lecturing a small audience
at the essence of every personal interaction of every business transaction of every effective human communication is persuasion
once you learn to control the linguistic encounter you will be shocked at what will happen
you are a person worth listening to and taking it one step higher than that you are someone who can help them achieve their goals
b jordan on the grounds of his estate addressing us
b do you dream of being financially independent but struggle every month just to pay your bills
would you like to own a home like this one someday but can barely afford to pay your rent
my name is jordan belfort and theres no secret to wealth creation
no matter who you are where you came from you too can become financially independent in just a matter of months
all you need is a strategy
new angle he enters from same side as previous shot
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages the first action you have to take is to decide to be wealthy
when i was years old i made a decision not to just survive but to thrive
i started my own stock brokerage firm developing a system of selling that within a year made me a multi millionaire

it touches down and jordan jumps out to address us so come to my seminar
the life of your dreams is only a decision away and bam
gets clothes lined by agent denham
close on jordans hands at last in cuffs
pan up to him looking none too pleased
this one takes the cake
it was rugrat hed been busted down in miami and guess who the fuck with
jean jacques saurel is handcuffed by feds as rugrat looks on crying handcuffed nearby
what were the odds
there had to be ten thousand swiss bankers in geneva and i choose the one dumb enough to get himself arrested on u
saurel gets his mug shot taken
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages even more ironic was hed gotten himself indicted on charges that had nothing to fucking do with me
rocky aoki japanese s is led out in handcuffs by a man in an fbi windbreaker
something about laundering drug money through offshore boat racing and a guy named rocky aoki the founder of benihana
a smiling rocky aoki looks on as a hibachi chef expertly dices shrimp on a sizzling grill
beni fucking hana
why would god be so cruel as to choose a chain of fucking hibachi restaurants to bring me down
saurel lays on the bed smoking
long story short was saurel ratted me out but not before he ratted out chantalle who it turns out hed been fucking every time she went to switzerland
chantalle emerges from the bathroom naked
laughing she runs and jumps in bed with saurel
with his criminal attorney nolan drager s next to him jordan stands before a judge being arraigned
i was indicted for money laundering securities fraud and an endless list of other shit
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages leafing through a subpoena one count engaging in conspiracy to commit securities fraud
two counts securities fraud
one count engaging in conspiracy to commit money laundering
twenty one counts money laundering
one count obstruction of justice
gives jordan a withering glare bail is set at ten million dollars
the judge bangs the gavel
jordan walks with nolan drager who flips through the subpoena
well its not good
its pretty bad actually
how much money do you have jordan
i can make bail
i dont mean the ten million i mean for legal fees
cuz if you want to fight this thing its gonna be expensive
like sell everything you own expensive
jordan exits the building
hes fucked and he knows it
he sees beautiful naomi waiting for him beside a limosine life isnt totally hopeless
nay thank god
im so glad youre here
he cant see her expression shed rather be anywhere else
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages on skylar and parker playing with a nanny and rocky the dog
jordan watches them sitting by his pool drinking an odouls weighing his options
donnie pops into the yard in uncle donnie mode
howre the happiest people in long island
joining jordan hate that fucking dog
tell me about it
its getting old starting to shit inside the house again
jordan offers donnie an odouls donnie declines
how you doing brother

lobster newburg sucked
they gave me some jewelry though
he shows off the electronic bracelet around his ankle
wonder if they got one in my size
fuckin rugrat that wig wearin hump

donnie sees naomi in a window
he waves but she barely registers him
whats up her ass
had to mortgage the home to make bail
probably gonna hafta sell it to pay my lawyers
if we fight this thing
donnie weighs that
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages the feds say anything about coming after the rest of us
jordan thinks then shakes his head no
you know were all behind you
everyone at the office
he removes an envelope hands it to jordan we bought back your mortgage
all the founding partners threw in a million apiece
figured none of us would have it if it werent for you
jordans profoundly touched
donnie squeezes his shoulder
a real moment of friendship
you gotta fight this thing baby
like i said loyalty meant a lot to me
without your friends and family standing behind you youre fucked
jordan sits with nolan drager across from fbi agent denham u
attorney lucas solomon s and assistant u
attorney rochelle applebaum s humorless
theres a term we have around here we dont like to use it often only when circumstances dictate
its called a grenada
inspired by our governments invasion in of the island nation of only people basically it stands for any case we get which is pretty much unlose able
we could show up late and drunk to court fuck up left right and center and still wed win
belfort you sir are a grenada
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages youre looking at real prison time
money laundering gets you as much as years
case couldnt be stronger if wed have caught you with your cash in your mattress
solomon pushes a box full of evidence across the table
jordan eyeballs denham
read the discovery
that your lifes work in the box
jordan you rotting in jail til your kidsre outta college isnt our ambition here
you werent the only one involved in all this
we think those folks deserve their day in court too
why do i get the sense theres an offer in the air
if so lets put it on the table
a comprehensive list of all coconspirators spanning the last seven years and he agrees to wear a wire
you want me to rat
we want your cooperation in yes
we want you to rat
how was christys party
it was fine
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages baby i talked to the lawyers again today
i have some really great news
as it turns out youre totally off the hook
i know that already
you never did anything wrong anyway right
at the end of the day all they really want is for me to cooperate thats it
see apparently i know so much about whats going on in the stock market that i could save the government years of heartache
but it gets even better
you see if i cooperate ill only have to serve four short years and any fine id have to pay wouldnt be due til after i serve my sentence
well still have plenty of money left over
the only thing that i was kind of upset about was the fact that i might have to give them information about my friends
like you said theres no friends on wall street
but theres a silver lining to that too
it turns out that all of em are probably gonna cooperate too
so in the end that wont really be a factor
well thats really good news honey
im really happy for you
no its good for both of us nay
make love to me baby
make love to me nice and slow
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages time cut jordan is fucking naomi
its the best hes felt in days
while hes lost in it shes lost interest going through the motions perfunctorily
i love you nay
i love you so much
ive loved you from the first time i saw you

the wolf of wall street buff revised pages after a beat
jordan rolls off naomi
they lie in uncomfortable silence
jordan that was the last time

after we just made love
and i wanted to puke
naomi gets up
i dont love you anymore jordan

im taking custody of the kids
if you agree to the divorce right now i will allow you visitation

naomi exits to the dressing room
jordan gets up follows after her
ive got news for you
youre not taking my kids
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages i already spoke to my lawyer
he said even if you dont get convicted i can still get custody
my lawyers are more powerful than yours
youre not taking my kids
you vicious cunt
naomi slaps jordan
jordan hits her back and exits
youre not taking my kids
you fucking bitch
jordan grabs a pair of scissors and starts slashing the couch
he retrieves a stash of coke from the couch lining
naomi enters the hallway as jordan snorts coke
look at yourself jordan
youre sick youre a sick man
youre not taking my kids
you think id let my kids near you
look at you
you know what my lawyers said
youre going to jail for twenty years
twenty fucking years jordan
youll be lucky if you ever see them again
you dont think im gonna see my kids again
jordan heads towards skylars room
she tries to stop jordan
he knocks her to the ground
jordan charges towards skylars room
jordan exiting skylars room with skylar crying in his arms
naomi starts to pull herself up from off the floor as jordan races toward the stairs
put her down jordan
put her down
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages jordan and skylar descend the stairs
naomi pulls herself together and follows
jordan races through the garage door slamming and locking it behind him
hes got skylar
get the key
jordan putting skylar in the car
naomi and violet desperately try to open the garage door
naomi races into the garage
jordan gets in the drivers seat locks the doors and starts the engine
naomi begs him to stop
violet presses the garage door button
naomi grabs a tool and smashes the driver side window
jordan sees the door closing he thinks fuck it slams into reverse crashing through the garage door
car continues in reverse crashing into a concrete pillar
naomi and violet rush to the car pull skylar out and bring her inside the house
jordan sits as blood rushes down his face
the defendant shall plead guilty to all counts of the indictment currently pending against him in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york
off a cooperation agreement we find nolan drager lucas solomon rochelle applebaum and agent denham all back at the conference table reading copies of the same contract
lucas does so aloud paragraph

jordans here too looking miserable
he stops lucas
lemme just sign the fucking thing
he signs the fucking thing
jordan sits alone finishes writing a long list of names on a yellow legal pad
for the next six hours i came up with a list
friends enemies business associates anybody whod ever known me or taken so much as a stock tip
the first name on the list was donnies
and as jordan heaves a huge sigh were suddenly
agent denham tapes a recorder to jordans inner thigh runs a microphone wire up his chest
agent hughes watches
talk normally breathe normally within five minutes youll forget you even have it on
jordan nods buttons up his shirt
wearing a suit and tie jordan walks in to the bullpen where the brokers spot him giving him a standing ovation
he forces a smile waves to the crowd
as robbie and chester ming look on jordan forces a smile as he approaches donnie who gives him a hug
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages jordan and donnie sit at the coffee table over takeout sushi
the trial wont be for months so obviously ill be counting on you to pick up the slack
whatever you need bro
you know that
jordan reaches in his jacket for a yellow slip of paper
and you know how much that means to me
hey you know what i wanted to ask you
jordan catches donnies eye pushes the paper over in front of him
the steve madden deal did he ever come through on that
donnie looks down at the paper reads jordans writing remember he was supposed to kick back like four mil from that one account
tell you the truth i was so fucked up i dont really remember anything about that
donnie slips the paper in his jacket gives jordan a look thank you
well if you talk to him let me know
you want the last yellowtail
and thus began my career as a government cooperator
i was a rat
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages jordan lays alone asleep in bed
we hear the doorbell
but i wasnt losing any sleep over it
after a few beats violet knocks enters
im sorry mr
you got a visitor
jordan descends the stairs in sweats and t shirt
agents denham and hughes are waiting
i need you to get dressed
whats going on
youre going to jail
agent denham holds up the slip of yellow paper that jordan gave to donnie
and on jordans look
donnie azoff my partner
my best friend
a tractor trailer is parked out front as a group of movers carry out paintings and antique furniture under the supervision of several fbi agents in windbreakers
after months of legal wrangling i was finally sentenced to prison
we see jordans various cars porsche mercedes ferrari bmw loaded onto a large transport vehicle
jordan stands addressing his brokers
we see the eager young faces hanging on his every word
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages i gave up everyone and in return got three years in some hellhole in nevada id never even heard of
like mad maxd said the chickensd come home to roost
whatever the fuck that means
jordans mother is there tears in her eyes
i hope your honor would agree that mr
belfort has distinguished himself in terms of his cooperation in this white collar fraud
belfort has helped the government win convictions over two dozen serious offenders and helped them recover millions of dollars to be made available for restitution to the victims
the sentence of the court shall be months in federal prison
pause please remand the defendant
max rolls his eyes jordans so guilty it hurts
as jordan is led away by guards
donnie sits in his office hears something a small army of fbi agents led by agents denham and hughes arrest half the office sea otter robbie kimmie etc
as the fbi cleans house donnie sits on his couch
close on denham reading a new york times article on jordans sentencing
he looks satisfied with his accomplishment until he looks up
and realizes hes right where jordan said hed be commuting home on the subway like any other piker
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages jordan rides in back stares out the window thinking about all hes done
the van stops as it arrives at the im not ashamed to admit when we arrived to prison i was absolutely terrified
jordan leaps to his feet
i neednt have been
a tennis ball hits pavement and we pan up to jordan in prison fatigues but playing doubles with three other prisoners all white middle aged executive types
sorry just out
what is that forty thirty
as the game continues jordan serving the camera pulls up to see the whole prison yard one group of inmates does tai chi while another has formed a book club
for a brief fleeting moment id forgotten i was rich and lived in america
i watch him speak and what he says is motivational about life
he tells about life and how you can be more rich
he is going to teach us how to be successful how to set our goals
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages i will build my future by using jordan belfort as my mentor
choosing what is good from him and being a millionaire
two hundred people attend jordans straight line persuasion seminar watching a massive screen on which these kids have appeared
jordan giving seminars in different locations see addendum below edited in with footage of looming economic uncertainties
then a man with a mic steps out
ladies and gentlemen please join me in welcoming to auckland new zealand
big applause as jordan takes the stage waving
this might go on a while
if so there could be titles jordan belfort spent months in federal prison and paid in fines
his cellmate was no fucking joke tommy chong
since his release hes become a multi millionaire again as a motivational speaker
when the applause finally dies down
jordan doesnt speak
instead he walks down to the front row of his audience studying faces
he picks one
takes a pen from his coat and offers it to him
sell me this pen
the kiwi embarrassed takes a moment then well its a good pen its a ballpoint jordan takes the pen back with a smile
hands it to the next person
the wolf of wall street buff revised pages sell me this pen
as the next person tries
we rake alongside his audience transfixed desperate for jordans knowledge desperate to be molded to be rich
sell me this pen
sell me this pen
sell me this pen
sell me this pen
