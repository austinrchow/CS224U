written by jim kouf the n and the e are not working
so it reads the pr ic motel
rooms to rent by day week month
the prince motel has passed its prime
a few beat up cars are parked outside rooms
we crane down to room seven
curtains closed but someone is holding it open a crack looking out
we push in close to the window and the eye looking over the parking lot
then the curtain closes
peeling flowered wallpaper ultra cheap furniture
the man moving away from the window is rodriguez
he is slender sports a thin mustache hair slicked straight back
hes in his late thirties
another man sits on the couch looking at a magazine
he is forty solidly built
his name is frank divinci
says here they got slips in honolulu
thats not bad
rodriguez sits down
but i gotta get at least a forty footer
itll handle rough water better and ill need the room if im gonna live on it
rodriguez stands up moves back to the window
divinci looks up
i dont know how you do it
how you can think about hawaii now
my hearts in hawaii
you never been there
how can your heart be there
youre tellin me theres no place youd rather be other than here
no im saying i just dont know how you can think about hawaii right now
if i was in hawaii right now i wouldnt be thinking about here
see the difference
look im not in hawaii im here
but i dont want to be here i want to be in hawaii
i cant be in hawaii therefore i think about it so as to not get depressed about being here
but im here i know im here i dont like being here but i cant be anyplace else because i look around and i see all this shit
how do you get around that
thats what im asking
rodriguez looks at his watch
no more hawaii okay
focus on this
rodriguez shakes his head exasperated and exits
to himself aloha my ass
poor side of town
a few old cars parked on the street
some buildings vacant
a late model white cadillac cruises past
we hear loud rap music
lionel hudd drives
hudd is thirty
the music is loud
his clothes lean to african roots
a woman sits next to the passenger window
her name is cynthia webb
cynthia is thirty five dressed in short provocative skirt tight top
a little too much make up
shes lead a hard life
she glances at hudd
hudd glances at her looks down at her skirt hiked up on her leg
left at the corner
hudds eyes linger on her thighs for a moment then he turns his attention back to driving tapping along with the heavy bass
the cadillac pulls into the parking lot
parks in front of room seven
hudd gets out looks around
cynthia gets out leads him to seven
the curtains pull back
divinci looks at hudd and cynthia
she nods to him
the door unlocks and opens
hudd looks around again
divinci waits at the door
he and hudd eye each other as hudd enters the room
divinci looks out making sure no one has followed then shuts the door
hope you dont mind me checkin you for weapons
hell yes i mind
this could break the deal
i just dont want no man handlin me
hudd looks at cynthia
the suggestion is taken
hudd spreads his legs lifts his arms
cynthia would rather not have the job but theres no choice
lotta good hidin places on this body
cynthia runs her hands over hudd checking pockets pants sleeves
finally coming to his crotch
cynthia has heard it all before
shes not squeamish in the least and she gives him a good going over
hes got nothin
she smiles back at hudd
then moves away sits on the couch and seductively crosses her legs
divinci satisfied pulls a plastic bag packed tight with cocaine out of his pocket tosses it to hudd
hudd sits on the couch opens the bag sticks his finger in and tastes the contents
but never takes his eyes off divinci
not bad not bad
any more where this came from
then maybe we talk again
hudd stands unzips his pants
reaches in to grab his cock but instead pulls out a stack of money
told you there was a lotta good hidin places on this body
hudd hands the money to divinci and pockets the plastic bag
then crosses to the door
glances back at cynthia
bet you gotta lotta nice hidin places too
then hudd smiles and exits
hudd gets into his cadillac pulls out of the motel parking lot
no one on the street this late
several of the buildings are boarded up
no music this time
his attitude has changed
lights in the rear view mirror
coming up fast
hudd watches as the car pulls around to pass
he glances at the car as it pulls past him but all we see is the flash of a blast from a gun
front window exploding
swerves into a parked car
the other car a buick regal screeches to a stop next to it
one man gets out
moving quickly to the cadillac
its dark difficult to see
he carries a smith and wesson
opens the door
hes wearing hudd is dead slumped against the passenger door
the man reaches in turns off the engine grabs the plastic bag of cocaine
and now we see its divinci
rodriguez is the driver
divinci dashes back to the buick hops in
rodriguez floors it
tears off down the dark street
not a great part of the city
apartment buildings line both sides of the street
an alley runs between two of the buildings
a taxi pulls up in front
headlights shining on a man passed out in the street
cynthia exits the taxi
the taxi pulls away
she glances at the man passed out in the street
his clothes are ragged
his face covered in beard and greasy dirty hair
hard to tell how old he is
his hand clutches a bottle in a bag
hey joe wake up
get outa the street before you get run over
joe wake up
she nudges him with her foot
the man groans rolls back
youre in the street joe
get outa the street
the man joe is silent for a moment then he starts to crawl toward the middle of the street
other way joe
joe turns his crawl toward the curb
cynthia watches him for a moment
he is truly pathetic
forget it joe
maybe youre better off right there
i dont think youd even feel it
cynthia enters the building next to the alley
the room is dark
we hear a door open and close
who is it
divinci crosses to the bed
got your money
put it on the table
she closes her eyes trying to go back to sleep
take a sleeping pill
theres some in my purse
you want your money
cynthias eyes open and she looks up at divinci
hes smiling holding up five one hundred dollar bills
i already worked for that
divinci unzips his pants
this is a bonus
cynthia snatches the money
divinci starts to undress
this aint my fault
this is a failure of our educational system
if you hadnt fallen through the cracks and dropped outa school you wouldnt be here now
so whats your excuse
im in love
cynthia just stares at him for a long beat
then she unbuckles divincis pants
a door is pushed open
rodriguez enters his one bedroom apartment
starts to shut the door when two men appear from the shadows
the first is short well dressed
his name is vic
the second is large heavy set shaved head
his name is cutless supreme
cutless supreme is not a man to be messed with
keepin some late hours
rodriguez looks at cutless supreme
what the hell you doin
whatre my neighbors gonna think
i understand your concerns
but you must understand that unlike a bank i cannot rely on a late fee as sufficient encouragement to repay ones debts
i am forced to employ the likes of mr
cutless supreme whom i might add contributes significantly to my overhead
i am the real loser here
and i am concerned about your sincerity in repaying the twenty seven thousand nine hundred forty two dollar gambling debt that is one week past due
what can you do to reassure me of your good intentions
i can make your life fuckin miserable thats what i can do
look at me
do i have a wife and three kids
do i have a good job at ibm
am i a handsome guy
no no and no
i loan money at excessively high interest rates to pricks like you who cant control their urges to lose big money playing cards and then i am forced to stay
up all night trying to convince them that i have needs too
the point of which is i already have a fuckin miserable life
so dont threaten me you lousy bag of cat shit
rodriguez steps toward vic but cutless supreme slides in between them
rodriguez isnt going to win this one
all im askin is that you be responsible
is that unreasonable
rodriguez backs off hesitates as he runs over his options
there arent any
he reaches into his pocket pulls out some of his nights earnings
four thousand is all i got
i am proportionally reassured
you purchased yourself an extension
vic takes the money heads for the street
rodriguez watches vic walk away
cutless supreme watches rodriguez
cutless supreme what kind of fuckin idiot name is that
it was the car my daddy stole to take my momma to the hospital but the cops stopped him and shot him dead in an alley before he could explain
i was born in the back seat
rodriguez glares at cutless supreme then he shuts the door
crime scene photographs dead drug dealers lying where they were shot
overlapping close ups of evidence tags and shelving filled with evidence from hundreds of crime scenes
and close shots of crime scenes chalk outlines bullet shells bloody foot prints
and finally crime scene tape
the black and white fades back into color surrounding the cadillac
we pull back revealing cops controlling the area
its early morning
a few people have stopped to watch
but this is not a high traffic area
another car pulls up
two men get out
we follow behind them as they approach the cadillac and patrolman mahoney who knows them
another day another body
where you wanna start
could be gang related
and now we see the two men from the unmarked car
its divinci and rodriguez
suit and ties
they act like they own the area
and they do
happened sometime last night early morning two three oclock
african american male looks like in his thirties
but even thats a guess
half his head is on the upholstery
oh sure hundreds
the bloody scene is untouched
hudds body is where it fell on the seat
dried blood everywhere
divinci looks in
behind a locked fenced in area
a desk officer checks in and out all evidence
he is twenty eight wears glasses very clean cut
two detectives are checking in evidence as divinci walks in
three shotgun shells twelve gauge
the desk officer checks in the evidence
three shotgun shells twelve gauge
the two detectives wave hellos to divinci as he approaches
heard you got a gang related
lucky guy divinci
you get all the pretty ones
one less drug store on the street
and the world is a safer place
the desk officer buzzes divinci through the door
divinci crosses to the filled with shelves
stacked with evidence from on going investigations
and the shelves are full of guns knives bloody gloves masks shoes etc
divinci looks around then removes the package of cocaine and the
from his pockets and places them back on one of the shelves
case number c
one thing about the
which we can see now a black stain on the metal of the handle
desks phones computers typewriters and homicide detectives
some witnesses being interviewed
rodriguez is on the phone at his desk
hes in the middle of an interview as he fills out one of the many forms that complicate his life
into phone a green car
you know what make
maybe a ford uh huh
you didnt see the license did you
divinci comes back to his desk next to rodriguez
rodriguez looks up
divinci gives him a confident smile and brushes his hands together clean hands
into phone yeah no i understand it was dark
divinci sits at his desk
he pulls an advertisement for a foot sport fishing boat out of his desk
he holds it up to rodriguez points to the boat
wanna go for a ride
into phone you think you could describe the driver
covers phone to divinci you bought it
as of last night ive got the down
just picture me under swayin palms with a mai tai
we can hear someone describing a felon over the phone but rodriguez isnt listening
hes looking at the boat
into phone uh huh
covers phone youre gonna buy it no shit
just a phone call away
divinci picks up the phone starts to dial
thats really great man
rodriguez suddenly realizes the person on the other end of the phone has stopped talking
back to phone uh huh okay
how tall was he
a heavy set man in his fifties approaches captain you got primary on the drug related this morning on th
im workin it up now
whos your second
divinci points at rodriguez in my office
both of you
captain henderson doesnt wait for a response
he heads for the office an inner office of glass and wood
divinci looks at rodriguez who is suddenly a little nervous
we can hear the person over the phone that hes talking to but hes no longer interested and hangs up on them
what the hell divinci motions keep calm
henderson is hanging up his coat as divinci and rodriguez enter
they arent the only ones in the office
richard simms thirty two trim short cut hair suit is waiting
detectives divinci and rodriguez this is richard simms
hes with the d
he wants to ask you some questions about your case
whats the occasion
you get an i
on the victim
were waitin for prints
divinci pulls out his note pad
car was registered to anchor imports
if you got all this what dyou want from us
the man in the car is lionel hudd
a little incensed how dyou know that
to henderson whats goin on here
hudd was dea undercover
rodriguez and divinci take the news like a sledgehammer
on their frozen expressions we hear he was workin a case on syndicate distribution of drugs on the south side
but every dealer we tagged kept getting killed
he finally got a lead on a girl hudd was a friend of mine
im gonna nail the sonuvabitch who killed him
a long beat on rodriguez and divinci then well do everything we can to help
screeching around a corner and up a drive into a vacant lot
the car skids to a stop and rodriguez gets out of the drivers side slamming the door and storming off
hes out of his mind
divinci gets out quickly follows him
rodriguez is so fired up and scared he cant stop moving
divinci catches rodriguez tries to stop him from flailing about
rodriguez tries to push divinci away but divinci holds on
they struggle pushing shoving falling to the dirt
divinci jumps on top of him pulling his pistol and shoving it into rodriguez mouth
shut up and listen to me
rodriguez glares up at divinci
they could be watchin us right now you asshole
so fuckin shape up
you got it
nothing from rodriguez i want you to nod
it takes rodriguez a moment but he nods
divinci pulls his gun out of rodriguez mouth gets off him and holsters his pistol
rodriguez is scared to death not of divinci of the mess theyre in
he just lies in the dirt
get the fuck up
rodriguez starts to get to his feet
divinci grabs him yanks him up
pushes him to the car
get in the car
they move back to the car
rodriguez gets back into the drivers seat
divinci moves around to the passenger side
gets in slams the door shut
they sit silently in the car for a moment in the middle of the vacant lot
after a beat theres no fuckin reason to panic
rodriguez turns slowly and looks at divinci incredulously
no fuckin reason to panic
did you say no fuckin reason to panic
stop being an idiot
were the cops on the case
its our case
we are going to find the fuckin killers
since when does that matter
rodriguez stares at divinci for a beat then we rodriguez and divinci are sitting on the car each with a beer and sharing a bottle of whiskey
all they want is someone to go down for the crime right
do we care who goes down for the crime
as long as someone goes down for the crime
its a slot thats gotta be filled
rodriguez is calmer but still something bothers him we killed a cop doesnt that bother you
of course it bothers me
what dyou want me to do turn myself in
well im not
thats the risk we take everyday somebody might pop us especially undercover like that
so he got popped
not by other cops
i patted him down
he wasnt wearin a wire he had no badge no gun how was i supposed to know
a moment of silence then look i feel just as bad as you do but we gotta start thinkin about us here
the important thing is we dont lose control of the case
we can never lose control of the case
whatever evidence there is goes through us
we lay down the trail
make it nice and logical
were the teachers and two and two can add up to five if its our classroom
whatre you talkin about are you sayin we stick somebody with this
evidence points wherever we want it to point
shit we can provide so much evidence even the asshole we pick will think he fuckin killed him
you got some asshole in mind
just dont worry
well find a killer
theres lots of em out there
three african american youths all in their twenties are hanging on a street corner
normal street traffic
they give a long hard look to an attractive african american woman who walks past
a little chatter
the unmarked car suddenly screeches to the curb
the black youths scatter quickly as divinci jumps out and goes after the tallest of the three
his name is james
rodriguez guns the car and gives chase on wheels
james darts across traffic
divinci running hard after him
rodriguez spins the car in a u turn
racing after them
james darts down the alley
narrow dark lined with trash bins
divinci turns into the alley but he isnt going to catch him
james is almost to the end when the car turns into the alley skidding to a stop
rodriguez jumps out gun leveled at james
no where for him to go
he slows down
rodriguez moves in from his front divinci runs up from behind
james is disgusted
what the helld i do now
divinci removes the package of cocaine and the
from the shelf
case number c
sliding across a table to james who stops it with his right hand
divinci and rodriguez are across from him
aint my gun
never is is it
that aint my fuckin gun
he shoves the gun back
divinci stops it with his arm careful not to touch it
got your fuckin prints on it
james quickly realizes what theyve done
he lunges for the gun but divinci picks it up quickly with a pencil through the trigger guard
james glares at them with murderous intent
where were you friday night
last friday night
where were you
whatever you think i did went down last friday night
better have a good alibi james or its good ali bye bye
a beat then james smiles
i was in jail you assholes
check it out
starts to laugh all night
what a couple a dickheads
rodriguez and divinci are silent
kicked in on a grungy small apartment
divinci and rodriguez burst in guns drawn
scaring the shit out of an hispanic man cortez and his half naked girlfriend as they watch television
sliding across the table back to rodriguez and divinci
cortez sits across from them
wearing white t shirt baggy pants
tattoos on his arms

smiles got your prints on it
stands angry you fuck i aint never seen that gun before
where were you last friday night
i wanna talk to a lawyer
just want they wanted to hear

cortez stares at them for a moment then did you say last friday night
cortez smiles and pulls up his shirt revealing a long scar across his stomach
intensive care you pindejo fuckin gutter shits
and thursday night and saturday too
i just fucking got out this morning
slamming into a wall hitting hard falling back to the dirty garbage covered alley
hes about twenty seven thin blond hair tied in a pony tail
he wears a flannel shirt jeans boots
he doesnt want to fight
his name is dave
alright alright alright
i aint gonna fight you
he looks up at divinci and rodriguez moving toward him
dave is behind the desk handling the
with no apparent problem
aint my gun
thats what they all say
wish it was
no better gun than smitty and wes
mag with serial numbers filed off
opens cylinder got any bullets
divinci walks around holds out his hand for the gun
who did i kill
where were you last friday night
you mean whats my alibi right
dave spits on the gun wipes off his prints with his shirt
i was breakin and entering
jewelry store on seventh and front about nine oclock
not even close to your jurisdiction
i got the rocks to prove it
he drops the gun clean of prints onto the table
sorry i cant help ya
but one to five is better than ten to life
divinci and rodriguez stare at dave
they are not happy
in plastic pages
a binder full of criminal portraits
divinci is going through one book
rodriguez searches another
we pulled him in last year for knifing that dealer on nd
almost killed him remember
hed be good
calls out to another anybody seen montrose lajolla
his life partner killed him in a domestic d about a month ago
rodriguez suddenly slams his book shut
divinci looks at him
rodriguez is angry tense
divinci gives him a look telling him this is not the time and place for a discussion on this topic
take it easy
this isnt gonna work
divinci leans toward rodriguez
nobody said it was gonna be easy
but lets not advertise our despair
the phone rings
divinci picks it up
into phone divinci
captain henderson is sitting behind his desk
divinci and rodriguez are in front of him
rodriguez is trying to hide his nervousness
divinci is absolutely cool
this is our case
not the goddamn deas
its been three days
were not fuckin magicians
what the hell is three days
this is a goddamn murder case
it takes a little bit of goddamn time
when a federal undercover officer goes down its never a fuckin murder case
i dont like the dea on my ass any better than you like em on yours
but this is personal for them and they want answers
forget your other cases and get something anything that i can give to them
the last thing i want is the goddamn f
on my back too
divinci and rodriguez are quiet for a beat then weve got a couple leads
we need a little more time
i cant hold em off much longer
this is no fuckin way to run an investigation
let me tell you both something if you dont solve this quick theyre gonna start askin why
and theyll be lookin to blame somebody in this department
so my advise to you is get something fuckin fast or turn over what youve got and get outa the way
rodriguez and divinci are quiet for a moment then how much time we got
a couple days
the funerals this afternoon
for agent hudd
simms wants you there
we didnt know him
how the hell do i know
its dea its their thing
youre the cops on the case i suppose they want you to know what a great guy hudd was so youll work all that harder to find his killer
itll reassure em how much you care and keep em off my ass
mourners gathered around the grave site
wife in tears
mother in tears
the men trying their best to hold up
beyond the family dea agents
simms among them
a show of support and solidarity
a reverend delivering and it is too easy to say that he was a good man in his job because he gave more than most
and its too easy to say that he was a good man in his community because he gave more than others
and its too easy to say he was a good man at home with his family because he was always there when they needed him
special agent lionel hudd was not just a good man he was an extraordinary man
and his death shall not be in vain
camera finds divinci and rodriguez at the back
rodriguez looks nervous
their conversation is quiet
dont humpty dumpty on me
whats that mean
your cracks are startin to show
divinci sees simms approaching from the side
get your balance
here comes the king
rodriguez glances toward simms as he walks up
the conversation is quiet
not wanting to disturb the ceremony
glad you came
divinci glances at rodriguez
nothin to brag about
but weve got a couple new leads were followin
look normally wed be all over this but your captain seems to think you can do the job
its your territory
i guess you know it better than anybody
and that can be worth a lot
but you understand
we wont wait forever
divinci is pissed
he doesnt like simms
just outa curiosity
what happened to his backup
you guys use backup on undercover dont you
it was a new lead
hudd was afraid backup would blow his cover
he was supposed to check in ten minutes after the deal went down
he never checked in
we want this one as bad as you do
a cops a cop
were in this together right
simms stares at rodriguez and divinci for a moment then he returns his attention to the ceremony
thats why i asked you to come here
just so you knew that
rodriguez and divinci walk down the street hot dogs in hand returning to their car parked curbside
he didnt have backup
you believe that
jesus what a dick
i dont think we should criticize that particular decision of his
i dont care what the reasons are you dont play lone fuckin ranger on a drug buy
youre just askin for it
thats all im sayin
i dont trust those bastards
theyre not waitin for us
theyre runnin their own investigation
i know it
the gun the coke came from evidence
the car came from impound
so whats to find
thats what im afraid of
theres nothing for them to find
we were too good
so whatre you worried about
nobody is that fuckin good
divinci looks at rodriguez then smiles
bumping and grinding her way through her performance
we dont see her face yet
just her body
g string and skin tight tank top
men in the audience appreciative
the room is smoky
lights swirl over the stage
the tank top comes off
whistles and cheers
and now we see the dancer its cynthia
cynthia moves down the hall in her g string and high heels
she enters the dressing room
divinci is sitting in the only chair in the cramped little room
hes going through her purse
cynthia stops when she sees him then shuts the door
i think this is breaking and entering isnt it
i work homicide i dont deal with that shit
puts on robe learn anything you didnt already have on file
you surprise me sometimes
here i think youre just a hard case and i discover youve got a heart of gold
holds up her drivers license youre an organ donor
thats really nice
the only problem is theyll never use your best parts
ill make sure you get them
hey dont get me wrong
i was just surprised that we had something in common
besides what we have in common
do everybody a favor if youre gonna donate your heart make sure it goes to science
most people want one that beats
what do the first three letters spell
dont get so clever
its out of character
divinci and cynthia are lying in bed
divinci has his arm around her but hes staring at the ceiling
whats so interesting up there
then whys it got all your attention
im thinkin thats all
divinci looks at cynthia
what if i was thinkin about us
dont waste your time
what if i was
wheres it gonna get us
maybe i got plans
i dont wanna hear em
plans just make you think somethins gonna get better
im fine now
i dont need to get screwed up waitin for something good to happen
i just want you to know love is important to me
but more important is loyalty
nothing is more important than that
not love not anything
because loyalty is about respect
you can talk about love all you want but without respect its empty
i mean the first thing that goes in a marriage is respect
and once its gone forget the love
so i am telling you i am loyal to you
like im loyal to my partner
we are closer than blood
and i trust him with my life
cynthia didnt really expect this from divinci
shes actually despite herself a little touched
whyre you telling me this
when you asked if i was thinkin about us and i said i wasnt i just want you to know that i do
a beat then just dont ask me to marry you
smiles why arent more women like you
divinci leans in and they kiss
divinci exits the building
starts to cross the street to his car parked on the opposite side when he hears something behind him
he turns instantly reaching for his pistol
a drunk staggers out of the alley looks like he has a gun in his hand
divinci instinctively raises his gun to shoot when the light catches the object in the drunks hand a brown bottle the neck sticking ahead like the barrel of a gun
lowers gun you fuckin idiot
the drunk stops when he hears the voice
looks through his matted greasy hair that cascades in front of his eyes
now we recognize joe
divinci turns away disgusted
opens his car door then stops
caught in a thought
he turns back and looks at joe again
joe stumbles back into the darkness of the alley
lies down next to a trash bin
lights suddenly illuminate joe
joe squints as a car moves right up to him
joe shields the light with an arm
we hear the door open and close then divinci bends down into the light
he is wearing a baseball cap backwards on his head
and gloves on his hands
he reaches inside joes whatve we got here
he pulls out the smith and wesson
divinci looks at joe
where were you last friday night
confused joe looks up at divinci through matted hair
joe up front
in an alcoholic daze
whats your name
joe looks at divinci
having trouble focusing
your name whats your name
whered you get the gun joe
joe looks down at his hands hes holding the
it was in your pocket joe your coat pocket
you must keep it for protection right
i dont know
sure you do joe
everybody needs protection
especially a guy like you lives on the street right
joe just stares at the gun
put it back in your pocket joe
you dont have to worry about me im not gonna hurt you
joe puts the gun into his jacket pocket
the location of hudds murder
the street is empty
divinci stops his car next to where hudd died
joe is asleep leaning against the window
divinci reaches across and yanks him
wake up joe
i want you to look at something
out the window joe
look out the window
joes eyes open
divinci forces his head to the window
this is where it happened joe
i want you to remember it
this is where you killed him joe tries to turn to divinci but divinci holds his head
you remember it now
how you shot him through the head
you remember it
lets go of joe you will
divinci slams his foot down on the accelerator and tears off down the street
alone in a double bed
the phone rings
rodriguez startles awake
catches the phone on the second ring
who the hell is this
divinci on the phone in the f
joe is passed out on the bed in the b
the room is dark
is that any way to answer the phone
its quarter to six
i know what time it is im not the one in bed
i need the photos of the scene
i got a suspect
but he cant remember all the details
he needs a little help
and i thought since youre my partner you might jump at the opportunity to lend me a fuckin hand
rodriguez sits up in bed
he doesnt remember last friday
he doesnt remember a lotta fridays
bring the shots and pick up a fifth of vodka
glances at joe make it two
asleep on the bed
time to get up joe
divinci slaps him
joes eyes open
i want you to look at something
the room is still dark
we now see rodriguez
hes wearing a black sock cap and gloves
he hands divinci police photographs of the car the street the victim the murder scene
divinci pulls joe into a sitting position
theres the guy and the street and the car
you remember how you shot him
joe stares at the photographs and starts to shake his head
you dont remember
thats not what you told me last night
joe is confused
if you remember you can have a drink
joe looks at the bottle rodriguez holds out to him
but you gotta remember how you saw him driving toward you and you were in the street and you were afraid he was going to hit you so you had
to shoot to protect yourself
you remember now dont you
joe stares at the photographs for a moment then nods
and wheres your gun joe where do you keep your gun
joe thinks a moment then reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out the
divinci hands joe the bottle and joe drinks
we push in on the bottle of vodka as the liquid drains away and we close in tight until we can see lionel hudds face as we hudd dead
blood on the windows
joe is drunk again
in a haze
starts to lift the bottle
rodriguez pulls it away
rodriguez and divinci always stay behind joe
whyd you kill him
it was your gun
i dont have a gun
yes you do
in your pocket
i know joe its tough to remember things you dont wanna remember
what about your last name joe
you got a last name
joe looks up as if trying to remember
or trying not to
come on joe everybodys got a last name
i dont remember
dont fuck with us joe
were trying to help you
whats your last goddamn name
joe shakes his head
i dont know
rodriguez suddenly smacks joe on the side of the head when he tries to look back
joe is surprised by the blow
divinci pushes rodriguez back
shakes his head telling him to back off
to joe friendly come on were all tired here joe
just give us your last name
i dont remember
okay fine whats in a name
but you remember the gun right in your pocket
and you remember that you told me you thought he was going to hit you right
thats why you shot
divinci looks at rodriguez
howd it happen joe tell me how it happened
prompting you saw him driving toward you i saw him driving toward me driving
the night that he was shot
he looks ahead into the darkness of the street
suddenly he sees a man standing in the street ahead of him
smiles and turns toward the man in the street
is pulled from a jacket pocket lifted toward the approaching car
the gun is in the hands of joe
he is scared
the headlights coming right at him
he aims and fires the gun
and the car swerves to the curb
joe watches from the street then looks at the
in his hand
rodriguez leans into joe who is now sitting on the edge of the bed looking down at the
in his hand
then what did you do
joe is in the street again
he doesnt know what he did
divinci leans close to joe from behind now
and now joe can imagine it
we push into joes eyes
as joe turns and runs
as fast as he can away from the death
he looks back over his shoulder scared
i didnt mean to
joe is staring at the gun
divinci and rodriguez watch him
he was going to hit me
i was scared
he was going to hit me
rodriguez looks at divinci
thats why you shot him
thats why i
aims the gun again at the approaching car
and we hear the gun shot again shattering the silence as we held by joes hand which is held by divincis gloved hand
divinci has held joes finger on the trigger and pulled it
the gunshot is deadened in the old building
joe is lying in the back seat of a car passed out with divinci holding the in his hand
the back door is open
the engine is running
helluva nice shot joe
divinci pulls the
out of joes hand then shuts the door gets into the front
the car pulls away exiting the warehouse
signing a name at the bottom of a paper joe
beneath it is the type written name joe doe
we pull back and see its joe signing a typewritten page as divinci and rodriguez watch
joe is a mess
when he finishes he pushes the paper away and puts his head down on the table
divinci picks up the paper and we a small yellow toyota with a bashed up left fender pulls to the curb
cynthia gets out lugging her purse and a bag of groceries
we hear another car door shut
divinci is walking across the street from his car toward her
its the middle of the day
divinci gives her a look as he takes the grocery bag from her
divinci leads the way into the apartment building
cynthia opens the door pulls the key out of the lock as divinci enters behind her with the groceries
i need you to do something
good i need the money
she shuts the door
divinci deposits the bag on the table
cynthia picks it up moves into the kitchen
this isnt a deal
where you goin
i got perishables okay
cynthia enters the kitchen and divinci follows
cynthia starts unloading the groceries putting the milk eggs etc
into the refrigerator
the guy we did the last deal with is dead
cynthia turns suddenly
somebody popped him that night probably when he tried to unload the stuff
i dont know
jesus does anybody dont worry theres no connection
we got the guy who did it
cynthia breathes a sigh of relief
you scared the hell outa me
we just need you to do one thing
divinci and rodriguez are moving down a hallway with cynthia
wants very much not to be here
hell be third from the left
dont fuck up
third from the left
whatm i supposed to say
just look at em and then look at the man the third from the left and say its him
and ill say are you sure
and you say absolutely
this is all i need to do right
we have a signed confession
him hes goin straight into the can
but this is it
im not doin anything more than this
hey its a done deal
rows of seats face a small platform
the lineup wall is striped with horizontal lines with height numbers
the brightly lighted lineup is separated from the gallery which is in the dark
uniformed guards are on hand to make sure there is no discussion verbal or otherwise between accused and witness
six men file onto the platform
all shady characters
stop and face front
the six men obey
a couple keep their heads down
the others squint from the bright lights
lift your heads look straight
heads are lifted
but we only recognize one of them standing third from the left
divinci rodriguez and cynthia are in the gallery
take your time
try and remember his face
cynthia counts three from the left and
wait a minute
she looks more closely
just to be sure
rodriguez and divinci watch her
shes obviously putting on a good show
then she turns to divinci sitting next to her and whispers i know him
divinci is caught a little of guard he didnt expect a private conversation nor does he want one for fear of it looking like hes coaching her
if you can identify the man whisper i know him
just tell us which one
cynthia frustrated gives divinci a look
i fucking know him
divinci still isnt sure whats gotten into her
rodriguez looks over a little annoyed
whats the problem
theres no problem
to cynthia pointedly do you see him up there
aside you dont understand
divinci is losing his patience
he doesnt want to blow the whole thing now not in front of guards and police personnel
the guards are beginning to wonder what the hells going on
so are the men in the line
hey come on do it or dont
divinci leans in close to her
we can hear grumbling from the men on the platform
pick the asshole out
cynthia starts to protest again but she suddenly feels divincis hand grip her arm
hes had enough
cynthia gets the message
and while keeping her eyes locked on divinci she says third man from the left
squints against the harsh light trying to see into the room as if he recognized the voice
rodriguez divinci and cynthia move briskly down the hall
none happy about what just happened
the conversation is strained
you mind telling me what that was all about
i know him
he hangs around my building
he lives in the alley or something
rodriguez looks at divinci
is this a problem
you dont think people that hang around your neighborhood can kill somebody
well let me tell you something
you dont live in a great fuckin neighborhood
divinci pulls a paper from his pocket
just sign the goddamn paper
you picked a man out of a lineup you have to sign that you did that so they dont think we made it up
cynthia just stares at rodriguez for a beat then now why the hell would they think something like that
you said all i had to do was pick him out
this is part of it
just sign it and youre done
how come youre so sure it was him
rodriguez rolls his eyes
we got it in writing
he didnt do it
how the hell dyou know that
were you with him at the time
you have a good goddamn alibi for him
maybe she was blowing him
better him than you
rodriguez grabs her arm and pushes her against the wall
divinci looks around quickly to see whos watching
take it easy
rodriguez angrily throws up his hands and glares at divinci
fine i got nothin at stake here
divinci gives him a look then leans right up next to cynthia
this is what they call an open and shut case
he did the kill and hes going down
dont make the mistake of thinking you know the right thing to do
divinci holds out the paper
cynthia hesitates a beat then takes it and signs her name
holding a number
the scene fades white with the flash
closing on joe who is standing in the small cell facing the wall his back to us
the door is locked and we as the
is placed on a shelf
but this time its tagged with a different number
as agent simms reads through it to the end
simms looks across at rodriguez and divinci
henderson and two other dea agents hooper and sarkasian are also present
the dea are in suits and ties
he wouldnt give us his last name
he signed a confession but he wouldnt give you his last name
he said he couldnt remember it
points to his head hes a head case
you run prints
but a forty four was used in commission
he had a forty four on him
it went down pretty quick
its our street
i think they did a helluva job
suddenly simms slams his hand down on the desk
everyone turns to simms
rodriguez is uneasy
some goddamn piece a shit blows him away for nothing
the intensity of simms anger quiets everybody
a beat as simms regains his composure
hudd was too good for this to happen
i just didnt think hed go down this way
simms crosses the room to divinci and rodriguez
he shakes their hands
hooper and sarkasian follow their boss out the door
rodriguez divinci and henderson exchange a look
do me a favor
make sure this one sticks
i dont want the d
assholes back in here
coming right at us
closer and closer
filling the screen
from the barrel of a
in slow motion a fireball
the gunshot is deafening like thunder
shatters in slow motion
covers his face with his hands to protect himself from the glass
but there is no glass
joe is sweating detoxing
he looks through his fingers but there is no street no dead man
just the bars of his cell
golden liquid caressing the ice
a hand lifts the glass to red lips
the liquid disappears
cynthia lowers the glass staring at it
what do the first three letters spell
cynthia suddenly hurls the glass across the room
shatters against the wall
and bits of glass edges sharp tumble through space like ice
a guard leads a man in a dark suit and striped tie down the corridor
he carries a briefcase
short hair and a beard and wire rimmed glasses
his name is elliot goff
word is he killed a dea undercover
no response word is he shot him in the face
no response word is he signed a confession
word is everyones entitled to a defense
no matter how guilty they are
they stop at the cell block door
the guard unlocks the door
inside the cell we can see joe on the floor in fetal position
shaking from lack of alcohol
elliot waits in the hall
fingers impatiently drumming his briefcase
the door opens and a doctor exits the room
i gave him something to help him through it
can i talk to him
the doctor nods opens the door
basic first aid station
joe is on a table
elliot walks up
doctor behind him
joe can you hear me
joes eyes open
im elliot goff
im your attorney
do you understand what im saying
joes eyes close
leaving elliot in the dark
court is in session
old metropolitan courthouse
the prosecutor and his team are at one table
the defense attorney and his client are at the other
the prosecutor is a woman
her name is helen eden
she is thirty nine
she wears a business suit
richard stein is her second in command
richard is thirty three
the defense attorney is fifty and a little on the portly side
his name is john oblinger
but its the defendant that really attracts our attention
his name is clyde d
hes done his best to look like a law abiding citizen but no matter what kind of clothes he wears or how he slicks down his long hair or trims
his mustache this sonuvabitch looks like hed kill for a nickel
hes on trial for murder
in the first
what a surprise
we are in the midst of opening statements
and helen is keeping the jury riveted
the presiding judge is a woman when the defendant clyde dunner entered the house of george and carol beaman on friday night a
caliber pistol in his hand
he entered the house with one thing in mind
to kill george and carol the people he blamed for the break up of his marriage to carols sister paula
the defendant is hardly listening
his attention is on two men sitting behind the prosecution table
and he turns to glare at them
the two men are detectives rodriguez and clyde glares at them as if hed like to get up right now walk over to them and cut off their heads
actually thats what hes thinking
he mouths you die
divinci mouths back
fuck you prick asshole dickhead
then he smiles
george and carol were watching a movie when he entered the living room and opened fire
george was killed instantly hit in the face
carol died later of three bullet wounds to her chest
john oblinger his attorney catches clydes murderous look and instructs him with a point of his hand to pay attention to helen
clyde reluctantly turns his gaze from divinci
then the defendant in his effort to cover up the crime doused them with lighter fluid and set the house on fire
carol was still alive
a young man looking very upset enters the courtroom shows i
to a guard then makes his way down the aisle
he tries his best to be quiet not to interrupt helens statement
ladies and gentlemen of the jury we will prove to you beyond any reasonable doubt that the defendant clyde david dunner is guilty of two counts of murder in the
helen looks at the jury for a beat then returns to her table
the defense may now proceed
john oblinger stands to present his side of the case
but our attention stays with helen as she approaches the table to find her team in an upset
their conversation is a tense whisper
i dont know where
are you sure
they looked all over whats wrong
they cant find the murder weapon
whatre you talking about
they cant find the goddamn gun
they lost it or something
misplaced it i dont know
they cant find it anywhere
no whisper this time what
a pause in the court
the judge taps his gavel in anger as we rodriguez divinci richard stein the young man and helen
helen is furious
i dont have a goddamn case without the goddamn gun
his fingerprints the ballistics everything
i have to have the fucking gun or hes gonna walk
that murdering piece of filth will go free without the
how could they lose it
rodriguez and divinci exchange a look
walking quickly down the steps
the dunner gun you used the fucking dunner gun
this is not my fuck up
our shooting was supposed to be gang related and unsolved
only because we tagged a goddamn undercover cop do we need the fucking
otherwise we never woulda needed it
so dont point your finger at me
but how are we supposed to explain how the same gun was used in two murder cases by two different killers when it was supposed to be in police custody
we dont explain it
its not our fault they lost the evidence
ballistics are already complete in dunners case
all we need is another gun
as it opens revealing a dozen different handguns
all my merchandise is in top condition
the best money can buy
a black man in a three piece suit picks up the
with a gloved hand
his accent is british
its got good knock down but its slow
unless you have a preference for revolvers i suggest a nine millimeter auto
they are more expensive but what they cost in money they save in time
rodriguez and divinci look down at the gun
the gun seller eyes them for a moment
you look like police
divinci and rodriguez stare at the gun seller
then he smiles
as the new
goes onto the shelf
case number c
elliot is waiting sitting at a table staring at papers in his open briefcase
door opens and a guard leads joe into the room
joe looks better for the first time
his hair is combed
and hes clean
he wears jail blues
but he is a little gaunt
the guard shuts the door leaving them alone
joe im elliot we met the other
well you werent in very good shape
you look much better
joe just stares at elliot
have a chair
we need to talk
about what i did
joe crosses to the table and takes a chair opposite elliot
joe before we get into what happened that night id like to check a couple of things first
looks at papers joe is your first name i assume joseph
not the answer elliot was looking for
what about doe
is that what you told the officers your last name was
i dont think so
what did you tell them your last name was
i dont remember
well is doe your last name
im not sure
elliot stares at joe
this is going to be a little more difficult than he thought
do you know what your last name is
i dont remember
joe im your attorney im here to help you
it doesnt matter if you give the court your last name or not they will still put you on trial
do you understand
so theres no reason to try and hide your identity
joe nods what is your last name
i would tell you if i could remember
joe smith joe jones joe dimaggio
elliot hopes he can trigger a response
joe tries hard
i dont think so
look well move on
you understand the charges against you
and if you are found guilty you could go to prison for a very long time
maybe i should
go to prison
i killed him
i didnt mean to
but he was going to hit me
yes i know i read your confession
joe if you really felt your life was in danger we might be able to use self defense as our argument
but before we get into that
do you have any family joe
i dont think so
do you know what a psychiatrist is
have you ever seen a psychiatrist
im not sure
joe you dont remember much about yourself
but you remember the night you shot the man in the car
im sorry im not much help
elliot stares at joe then looks down at the blank page in front of him
the trial of clyde d
dunner in progress
prosecution team at their table
defense team at their table
judge weinberg at the bench
divinci on the stand
clyde glaring at him
and jury listening to helen on the floor prosecuting with vigor
and when you approached the suspect in his apartment did you identify yourself as a police officer
did the suspect respond
yes he did
in what way
he started shooting through the door
the defendant fired six times until his gun was empty
we would like to show you the weapon he used
helen crosses to the prosecution table picks up the
she holds it up for the jury to see
and we would like to enter it into court records
it was the same smith and wesson revolver he used to viciously murder george and carol beaman
is duly entered into the records
glances at his
as it passes into the bailiffs hands
the prosecution would like to call mr
allen to the stand
allen a short balding bespectacled man in his fifties crosses to the witness box where he is sworn in then sits
allen would tell the court what you do
i am a lab technician for the police department
one of my duties is to examine weapons used in violent crimes
clydes attention is on helens legs
hes bored by the proceedings but something suddenly strikes him
he looks at on the evidence table
there is no black stain on the handle
i tested the defendants revolver and matched the bullets fired to the bullets removed from the deceased
that aint my gun
all attention turns to clyde
his attorney the judge the jury helen everybody is surprised by the sudden statement
i must remind the defendant that he is not to speak out when that aint my gun
the judge taps her gavel
john oblinger puts a hand on clydes arm
clyde pulls it away
and now things happen very fast
and clyde is moving toward the gun
and the bailiff and guards are moving toward clyde
and helen is moving out of the way
and the judge is standing banging her gavel
and the jury is scared
clyde grabs for the gun as the bailiff and guards grab for clyde
clyde turns and decks the bailiff and all hell breaks lose
door slams open
rodriguez and divinci enter
rodriguez quickly checks all the stalls as divinci closes the door
they are alone
when rodriguez finishes with the stalls we gotta put the right gun back
we cant put the right gun back
without that gun they wont convict joe
without that gun they wont convict clyde
im not worried about clyde im worried about us
look joes never goin to trial right
he signed a goddamn confession
like you said this one is open and shut
clydes the one we gotta worry about
we cant let him go back on the street
hes a fuckin psychopath
hell kill somebody again
how the hell did that piece of puke know it wasnt his fuckin gun
i dont think he knows his own fuckin mother but he knows his fuckin gun
i dont think thats important right now
the harried desk officer is filling out his usual paper work when divinci and rodriguez approach
divinci knocks on the door
the desk officer looks up
hes had a tough day
sorry divinci cant do it
what dyou mean you cant do it
i gotta check something
you gotta get written permission from the chief
since an hour ago when he came down here and chewed me a new asshole bigger than a three car garage
whats the problem
something about missing evidence or who the hell knows
i just wanna transfer the hell outa here
what the hellre we supposed to do
ask the chief
policy aint my department
joes preliminary trial
joe is seated at the defense table with elliot
another judge judge harold pine is behind the bench
this is a preliminary hearing to determine if theres enough evidence for joe to stand trail
elliot is shuffling papers in preparation for his opening
and at the prosecution table is a very tired helen
she looks completely pissed off and worn out
in no mood for anything to go wrong
whenever youre ready
we would like to plead not guilty to the charge of murder at this time for reason of insanity
helen gives elliot a look
she doesnt need this
but i did it
elliot turns to joe
let me handle this
but i signed the confession
dont worry about it
im the attorney
your honor can we have a moment
council may approach the bench
helen and elliot cross to the bench
your honor my colleagues client admits to the killing
i dont see any reason to go through a trial when its obvious he would like to plead guilty
i dont agree
if he wants to plead guilty you have to let him plead guilty
not if hes not of sound mind
come on elliot
i think hes crazy
i know you think hes just putting it on thats d
standard procedure but i dont think he is
so your honor im standing by the not guilty because i believe hes incapable of making that judgment
have you had a psychiatrist look at him
yes your honor
hands him papers i think youll see that my diagnosis is not without warrant
the judge hesitates then looks at joe
joe is staring at him
ill review the findings and make my decision tomorrow
thank you your honor
to helen besides i hear theres a good chance of beating the charges for lack of evidence
helens look turns icy
not a place for the health conscious
rodriguez and divinci at a corner booth
both with scotch and waters
nobody can connect us to the evidence thing
were clean there
rodriguez is quiet
the most important one is this dea mess anyway
once thats finished were completely in the clear
you know we cant do it anymore
yeah i guess
no were through
good while it lasted though
a hundred grand apiece
not bad for a few nights work
divinci lifts his glass in a toast to himself drinks
i just wanna get through this
were gonna get through it
no evidence problems on this one
i hope not
i dont know frank lately i been thinkin
maybe what we did wasnt such a good idea
hey we took out a few scumbags thats it
nobodys ever gonna miss those shitheels
they were all pieces of garbage
not one of em had a sheet less than a mile long
drugs extortion assault
they were all fuckin guilty as hell and still on the street you know that
except the cop
yeah except the cop
thats part of the job
could just as easily have happened to you or me
but were cops you know
we fucked up
we fucked up once
once outa ten
thats not bad
a beat im sorry okay
he was in the wrong place at the wrong time what can i say
im not goin down for it
look if we got paid a decent salary we wouldnt be tempted by this right
and what happens when we retire
you think our pensions gonna take care of us
we are on our own
i mean all i want in life is a goddamn fishing boat a beach a couple drinks and some hawaiian fuckin music
that aint much for twenty years putting murdering assholes behind bars
i mean the dealers the pimps the killers they got no rules
we got all the fuckin rules
it aint fair
thats all im sayin it aint fair
for awhile we made it fair
rodriguez downs his scotch
quit thinkin youre a bad guy
youre not a fuckin bad guy
you made one mistake
let it go
a waitress comes to the table
rodriguez orders another
the waitress leaves
rodriguez hesitates a moment then do you think were corrupt
hey i never took a fuckin bribe in my life
nobody ever bought me
no fuckin way
even the thought makes me sick
and what we did has nothing to do with being corrupt
its two completely different things
dont get em confused
i guess youre right
im telling you
its nothin to do with corrupt
im worried thats all
hey you gotta worry a little
just dont lose your sense of humor
my sense of humor right
the problem with people is nobody gives a shit about makin the world a better place
you and me i dont care what anybody says we made the world a better place
no matter what happens
there are ten less drug dealin assholes on the street today because of us
theyre not plea bargainin their way back onto the street theyre not clogging up the courts and theyre not costing the tax payers a fuckin penny because theyre not in
they were garbage
and theres nothin wrong with takin out the garbage
divinci downs his scotch
rodriguez nods then so you think youll get back with caroline
nothin i ever do is good enough you know
never is never was never will be
guess i gotta make the effort
its gonna cost me if i dont
tell me about it
you know how much i got left
youre gonna think im an idiot but
i like cynthia
theres no bullshit with her
i just fuckin like her
i think you just like fuckin her
divinci looks at him for a beat then yeah that too
with joes photograph on the front page
headline undercover cop gunned down by undercover killer
we pan around to cynthia sitting in her kitchen staring at the photograph
what the hell joe at least you wont get run over
she folds up the paper and throws it in the trash can
the dunner trial
the jury is back
helen judge weinberg clyde d
dunner who now sports a couple bandages to his head his attorney john oblinger theyre all waiting for the verdict
the defendant will stand and face the jury
what is your verdict
we find the defendant clyde david dunner not guilty
helen closes her eyes in defeat
divinci is on the phone
when was the last time you saw him
uh huh and you havent seen him since then
rodriguez suddenly strides up
he looks panicked
we gotta talk
into phone just a second
covers phone calm down
leans in close theyre takin joe to trial
divinci stares at rodriguez for a beat the reality of his statement taking a moment to fully slam home
they found him mentally unable to plead so his attorney pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity
you gotta be kiddin me
yeah thats me i love to make people laugh
you hear the one about the two cops who popped the undercover cynthia on stage in the middle of her routine
hoots and whistles from the all male crowd
but shes not really into her performance tonight
she pulls off the last of her clothing to applause and cheers
an asian man in sweat shirt and jeans is sitting in the room
who the hellre you and what the fuck are you doing in here
calls down hall to the man i suggest you get out before bob gets here
he doesnt like assholes
youre cynthia webb
calls down hall the asian man stands
but you are cynthia webb the famous dancer yes

the man moves toward her pulling a paper from his pocket
he hands it to her
i liked your show very much
what the hells this
cynthia stares at the paper a subpoena
i didnt do anything
but the man is gone
bob a huge bouncer tears past giving chase
staring at paper oh shit
he served me
he fuckin served me
a hand picks up the phone
this is sergeant gardner down at the station
the station is alive with activity
even at this early hour
hookers pimps pushers drunk drivers
some being booked some being released some being obnoxious
sorry to call so late but i got a hysterical woman here says she needs to talk to you about a murder
divinci turns on the light revealing a woman in bed with him
he picks up his watch looks at the time
i told her i couldnt call you at home but she said that it was very important
a matter of you know life and death
whats her name
divinci perks up at the name
and now we see cynthia in the police station trying not to look as freaked out as she feels
but shes not holding together well
tell her to wait ill be right down
divinci hangs up
starts to dress
the woman groans
what the hellre you doing
i gotta go down to the station
what time is it
go back to sleep
frank this is no way to repair our marriage you know
she pulls the covers over her head
divinci pulls on his pants
divinci pushes into the room
sees cynthia sitting on the bench looking nervous as hell
smoking tapping her foot looking around
just this side of a wreck
cynthia sees him and is immediately on her feet moving to him
frank i cant do this
he came to the club
you gotta not here
he takes her arm leads her out of the station
divinci leads cynthia out of the station to his car
i thought you said all i had to do was pick him out
thats what you said thats all i had to do
i did what you said
but that was supposed to be all
he opens the drivers door pushes her in
gets in behind her
cynthia is a bundle of nerves
divinci slams the door
cynthia is startled by the suddenness of his anger
whatre you talkin about
cynthia opens her purse and pulls out the subpoena
they want me in court
divinci glances at the papers
you promised me i wasnt gonna have to do anything
what the hell is goin on
this is yet another glitch that divinci hadnt counted on
i cant do this frank
i cant go into court
im gettin outa here
you are not getting outa here
well i cant go to court
thats not cynthia glares at him then turns away takes a drag and blows out the smoke
divinci hesitates as another car pulls out
then turns to her
look youre a witness thats all
you got nothin to worry about
you saw something happen what
what did i see
i will tell you everything you gotta know
you will know exactly what to say
cynthia looks at divinci unsure
divinci gives her a confident smile
look its another stage thats all
just like dancin
pulls quickly out of the parking garage
elliot is waiting
the guard opens the door and joe enters
joe is looking better
getting him off booze has helped immensely
youre looking much better
i guess jails been good for me
elliot nods motions for joe to take a chair
trial dates been set for thursday
ive been thinking about what i did
and i dont think its right that i try getting off
i want to plead guilty
i killed a man and i should be punished
im a little surprised
nobody ever wants to be punished for what theyve done
its just a new concept
but i still think our defense is reasonable
i dont believe under the condition you were in that you were responsible for your actions
but why was i carrying a gun
i had no right to carry a gun
if you hadnt been carrying the gun you might be dead
and he might be alive
can i think about this
ive made up my mind
elliot stares at joe for a beat then we two murder victims lying in the street
police officers have the area under control
a few curious people have stopped to watch
an unmarked car pulls up
rodriguez behind the wheel
divinci next to him
what if she takes off
then we got no goddamn witness puts him at the scene
and what happens if she testifies and nobody fuckin believes her
but thats a fifty fifty
they might believe her
shit frank shes a goddamn stripper for chrissake whos gonna believe her
i dont believe her when shes telling the truth
an officer walks to the car and knocks on the window
divinci rolls it down
ahh we got two bodies out here and three more in the house
i was just wondering if you were gonna be the primary on this one thats all
yeah yeah were comin
just give us some room
divinci rolls the window back up
the officer backs off
she could blow the whole thing
she could tie us in and that would be it
wed be fuckin fried
if it looks like shes gonna crumble well take steps
divinci looks at rodriguez
one more chalk outline more or less in this city whos gonna know
oh shit frank
hey hey you think i like this
we just cant go around killin everybody

the suitcase is slammed shut

a black convertible mercedes pulls into the circular gated drive of the large two story home on immense manicured grounds
a bmw is parked in front of the four car garage
it is being waxed by car care specialists
the mercedes stops and a man gets out
he has gray hair and expensive clothes
he carries a briefcase and heads for the front door
his name is arthur baylor
a butler shows arthur to the patio where another man nathan mccall is seated behind a table reviewing documents

revealing the photograph of joe and the headline undercover cop gunned down by undercover killer
mccall looks at the paper

arthur points at the photograph

cynthia boards a greyhound
getting the hell out of dodge
we hear a key in the lock
the door opens and divinci enters
he looks around
he moves into the bedroom
sees clothes strewn around and a half empty closet
he heads back into the living room
pulls open the door and almost runs into richard stein who was just about to knock

joe william is lead into the courtroom by guards
takes his place at the defense table which includes elliot and two young attorneys
the prosecution table which includes richard stein and helen is going over last minute minutia
people are taking seats in the gallery
but another attorney joins the defense table
its arthur baylor
and richard stein double takes when he sees him
to helen isnt that arthur baylor
they watch arthur shake hands with everyone elliot the two young attorneys and joe

arthur takes a seat at the defense table and glances across at helen and richard and nods
helen and richard are stunned

the criminal court department g is now in session
the honorable harold w
everyone rises as judge harold pine enters
in black robe
taking his place behind the bench
please be seated and come to order
and even judge harold pine double takes when he sees arthur baylor at the defense table
the people versus joe doe in case number
before we proceed id like to ask the defense if theres anything this court should be made aware of
yes your honor
i have joined the defense in the representation of mr
william dane mccall otherwise known to this court as joe doe
everyone turns to look at joe william mccall
camera pushes in on him
it doesnt look as if hes sure who he is yet
i have represented the mccall family for several years before william mccalls disappearance seven years ago
it was assumed that he had died but since he has reappeared under these tragic circumstances i would ask this court for a continuance to allow the defense to prepare
adequately in light of his real identity now being known
how long do you need
one week should be sufficient
any objection to a weeks continuance by the state
believe so your honor
then i grant a one week continuance
we will start the proceedings next monday morning
judge harold pine taps his gavel
flash joes photograph and scenes of him being lead from the courtroom
helen and richard stein are watching
they cant believe it
when it was discovered that the man who has confessed to killing an undercover dea agent was actually himself thought dead for seven years
the man who signed the confession as joe doe is actually william dane mccall brother of nathan mccall
both are sons of the founder of mccall international a corporation involved in telecommunications computer design and development and other related industries
the net worth of both men is estimated at over a billion dollars parked on the street
rodriguez and divinci inside
rodriguez reads the paper
but william mccall shunned the business world and turned his life to medicine receiving his medical degree from harvard in
once again he turned his back on the established norm and spent several years in africa performing organ transplants for the poor
rodriguez slams down the paper
jesus christ this is who you picked
a goddamn surgeon who performs organ transplants on poor africans
he was living in the fuckin street
how the hell was i supposed to know he was a goddamn doctor
hes not a goddamn doctor
you picked a fuckin saint to pin a fuckin murder on
divinci grabs the paper away from him
both cops are angry upset frustrated and scared to death
when we pick em we really fuckin pick em
we shoulda just picked up the fuckin pope
reading he disappeared seven years ago on september two weeks after the tragic death of his wife and two young children in a multiple vehicle accident
at the time it was assumed that he had returned to africa but that was never confirmed
what william mccall has been doing for seven years is now the mystery that the court will try to help unravel
divinci closes the paper
alright alright lets think here
whats the worse case scenario
are you asking me if i can think of something worse than what weve done that we can still do or something worse that might happen to us if this
all blows up and we are convicted and sent to jail and die in the electric chair and go to hell
divinci looks at rodriguez
work with me here
im a little on edge
would you repeat the question
both men are quiet for a moment then even if the doc walks theres no evidence ties us to it
theres only one person who can connect us to hudd
okay fine i dont wanna argue about it anymore
lets just fuckin kill her
manny ladrew is pouring himself a cup of coffee
his secretary is typing up a letter at her desk
we need to talk
manny recognizes the voice
he mouths an oh fuck to himself then turns around to divinci who is standing in the doorway

her sister said some cops took her
i thought it was you
divinci glares at manny for a beat then he storms out

manny looks down at his secretary
youre a good judge of character
at his desk on the phone

divinci slams down the phone
he sits quietly for a moment then rubs his face
rodriguez crosses to his desk sits down

the room is dark
two men are hammering on manny
throwing him against the wall pulling him up and hitting him in the stomach not the face

manny is too hurt to get up
divinci walks over to him rubbing his gloved hand
dont ever lie to me again
manny looks up weakly
divinci walks away
rodriguez opens the door and they exit
joe is sitting on his cot staring at the floor
another man is in the cell with him reading a magazine
his name is duncan
duncan looks at joe

joe is lead down the hall by two guards past rows of cells filled with other prisoners the criminal court department g is now in session
the honorable harold w
we hear people rise please be seated and come to order
joe is lead to a waiting prison van
he gets inside
the people versus william mccall in case number
the van pulls away
as it is introduced into evidence
when he pulled this gun and fired at the driver of the car
killing him instantly
let the record show that this is the weapon used in the crime a smith and wesson forty four caliber handgun
joe is sitting at the defense table with arthur and elliot
the trial is underway
and they watch the
go to the evidence table the
with the black stain
richard stein is seated at the defense table
he too is watching the
he leans across to his assistant
all these goddamn guns are startin to look the same to me
on the stand being questioned by helen
and when you arrested the defendant did he deny that he had killed agent hudd
can you describe the defendants condition at the time of his arrest
he was drunk
we could smell the booze on him
but we drew blood
he didnt object
we have the blood test report that shows picks up report that he had four times the legal limit to drive
the people would like to enter this into evidence
they so enter it
on the stand
elliot is cross examining
and you arrested the defendant four days after the killing
what lead you to suspect mr
you ask questions
work the neighborhood
find out who was on the street that night
yes but specifically mr
he had no previous criminal record
we found someone whod seen him in the area
so we picked him up for questioning
we didnt expect it to be him
but if someone saw him in the area that night we would want to talk to him
if he wasnt the killer he mightve seen the killer
just routine really
where did you find the defendant
on the street
corner of third and madison
what was he doing
he was passed out
but you knew it was the man you were looking for
based on what
who provided you with the description
hesitates a beat cynthia something i think
elliot moves to the defense table glances at arthur as he picks up a paper
arthur nods approvingly
elliot looks at the paper
i believe her name is cynthia webb
according to the statement filed the night she picked him out of the line up
the name familiar
where did you find ms webb
on the street
and she agreed to pick the defendant out of a line up
where you aware that ms webb disappeared after she was served with a subpoena
yes my partner and i tried to contact her about the case and were unsuccessful
thank you detective thats all the questions i have
rodriguez gets up as we a waitress cruises past tables to the booth in the back
she sets down two scotch and waters to the two men
rodriguez and divinci
the waitress exits
divinci picks up his glass
to justice in all its forms
rodriguez picks up his glass
were not home free yet
without ms webb theres no place they can go
we still got the confession the gun the ballistics
and i dont give a shit about all this african doctor crap
the man is a drunk and hes been a drunk for seven goddamn years
so lets have a drink for drunks
rodriguez reluctantly lifts his glass
they clink and drink
thats the thing about life
you control it or it controls you
most people dont understand that
they tryn blame their fuck ups on something or somebody else
but its not like that
i dont wanna hear why your lifes a mess
its a mess cause youre a mess
theyre waitin to live happily ever after
but after what
after all the shit happens
well i got a clue for everybody the shit never stops happening
so you deal with it or you get buried in it

you just work it
and you dont take it too serious
you cant take it too serious otherwise you get fragile
and you cant be fragile and have any fuckin fun
you think im fragile
thats the first sign of trouble when you start askin other people
i just wish i knew where the hell she was
helen and richard stein are working late
over take out chinese
referring to papers so i think well have to rely on the confession for his description of what happened
hell never take the stand even if the phone rings
richard picks up
into phone d
where will richard is surprised
he turns to helen
they found cynthia webb
i dont know
i dont know
well who the hell was that
i dont know
they hung up
richard hangs up the receiver
he and helen exchange a look
what the fuck is going on
your honor the people call ms
cynthia webb to the stand
rodriguez and divinci are stunned
elliot is completely surprised
arthur is never shaken by anything
the courtroom doors open and cynthia is lead down the aisle by a sheriffs deputy
she moves to the chair
but its joes turn to double take
he remembers her
my god he knows her
its cynthia the girl from the apartment building
he never saw who pointed him out but he never expected it to be her
raise your right hand
cynthia raises her hand
but her look goes right to joe
staring at him
shes never seen joe like this cleaned up trimmed handsome
shes not sure she even recognizes him
you swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god
she turns her eyes from joe
you may be seated
cynthia sits down
looks at divinci
and joe leans across to arthur and elliot
their conversation is in whispers i know her
shes the woman who identified you
i mean i know her
im not sure
i think i lived near her
arthur exchanges a look with elliot
arthur turns now and looks at cynthia
the wheels are turning
please state your name for the court
do you see the man that you identified in a police line up in this room
is it the defendant mr
cynthia looks at joe
joe looks straight at her
cynthia turns her eyes away
please describe what you saw the night of september th
i was comin out of an all night minimart cynthia comes out of a all night mini mart with a bag of food
she walks down the street and suddenly we hear a gunshot
followed by a car crash
she turns toward the sound
and we hear running footsteps
then we see a man running
he has a pistol in one hand
cynthia watches the man run past and disappear into the darkness
cynthia is looking at helen
and youre positive the man you saw with the gun is the defendant
instead of looking at joe cynthia turns to rodriguez and divinci who are seated in the rows behind the prosecution table
they are looking right at her
they wait for her answer
no further questions
divinci offers her a small smile
cynthia turns away
arthur is now standing in front of her
is it miss
miss webb had you ever seen the defendant before that night the night you described to us
do you know what perjury is
when you lie
when you lie under oath in a court of law
do you know what the penalty for that is
you go to jail
cynthia have you ever seen the defendant before that night
the witness has already answered that question
i just want to give the witness the opportunity to remember if she could have seen mr
mccall anyplace else before the night in question
divinci stares at cynthia
as if willing her to give the answer he wants her to give
webb do you understand the consequences of perjury
lets get on with it then
what did you buy the night you went into the mini mart
what did i buy
you remembered seeing mr
mccall that night and hearing the gunshot and a car crash
i just wondered if you remembered what you bought in the mini mart
shampoo i think
where do you live
is that close to where this mini mart is
how far would you say
i dont really know
within walking distance
i dont think so
did you walk there that night or drive
but when you left the mini mart you stated that you walked down the street
to the corner
your honor i dont see a point to this line of questioning
is there a point
yes your honor
since this is the only witness im trying to establish what the scene was like that night
try to get there as quickly as possible
to cynthia and how far away from the corner was the mini mart
for example was it in the middle of the block close to the corner where
in the middle i think
so you walked all the way to the corner
i assume then you were walking back to your car yes
was there a reason you parked so far away
getting nervous um
there were lots of cars parked on the street
was there anyone else on the street besides you
lots of cars but no people
i dont remember
so you were the only person to see joe on the street that night
i didnt see anybody else
so you heard a gunshot a car crash and a man running with a gun in his hand
what did you do then
did you call the police
i went home
you went home
and youre sure it was joe you saw that night
when you went home
when you went home you saw joe
cynthia realizes what shes said
defense is trying to confuse the witness
im not trying to confuse the witness its the witness thats trying to confuse the court
i have witnesses who will refute her testimony
witnesses who were on that corner the night of the shooting who never saw ms
webb who never heard the gunshot who never saw joe run past
ms webb saw joe outside her apartment building that night because he lived in the alley next to it
isnt that right ms webb
arthur turns dramatically to cynthia
she is scared
everyones attention is on cynthia
when i referred to him as joe you knew who i was talking about didnt you
this case is the people versus mr
joe has never been mentioned in this trial
how did you know who i was talking about ms
cynthia looks from arthur to divinci
divinci is frozen
rodriguez is sweating
then cynthia turns and looks at joe
joe looks at her feeling sorry for her
not hating her
webb how did you know that joe was the defendant
cynthia lowers her eyes to the floor
he lived in the alley next to my apartment building
helen and richard stein are stunned yet again
to herself oh shit
divinci and rodriguez are doing their best to remain cool calm and collected
why did you lie to this court
i dont know
are you afraid of somebody
i dont know
are you protecting somebody
i dont know
answer the questions ms
webb or ill be forced to cite you for contempt
cynthia looks up at the judge
shes not talking
having her mug shots taken
holding a number
on the flash driving
she didnt talk
dont hold your breath
you think shell talk
i know shell talk
well make it look gang related
problem is were gonna need another gun
have you forgotten
shes in fucking jail
thats the goddamn problem
since when is being in jail a guaranty of a long life
you just get a fuckin gun
rodriguez gets out of the car
divinci pulls away driving into traffic
rodriguez heads into the station
manny looks up from his desk
his face is bruised and bandaged
i didnt do anything
everythings fine manny
i just came to apologize
looks at secretary we need some privacy
manny looks at divinci then motions for his secretary to take a walk
she gets up exits

divinci pulls out a piece of paper
i want her out tonight

divinci stares at rodriguez for a beat then starts car
the unmarked car turns off the street onto the side street and stops
the lights go out

rodriguez hesitates breathes a sigh then returns to the car
they both get back in
divinci starts up the car
ill just feel a whole lot better when shes dead
then were off the hook
divinci starts to shift gears but suddenly throws his elbow into rodriguez face
and divinci is all over him like a tornado
slamming a fist into his face repeatedly
he grabs his shirt and rips it open revealing the tape recorder strapped to his body recording their every word
divinci puts his revolver to rodriguez head
rodriguez bleeding from the mouth and nose looks at frank
i am im a fuckin rat
i traded you frank i fuckin traded you
simms knows everything
divinci pulls back the hammer ready to blow rodriguez head off
just fuckin shoot me get it the fuck over with

divinci rips the wires off the recorder
rodriguez closes his eyes waiting for the end
a tense moment then get out
rodriguez opens his eyes looking at divinci who is still holding the gun to his head
another moment then frank calm get outa the car now
a beat then rodriguez gets out
divinci looks up at his partner
this is why you can never ever lose your sense of fuckin humor
the car tears away leaving rodriguez alone in the alley
rodriguez pushes open the door to his apartment enters
shuts the door
stands alone in the room for a moment then suddenly erupts in rage
ripping off his coat ripping off his shirt ripping off the tape recorder taped to his chest
he throws the recorder on the ground
stomps on it until its shattered into pieces
he stares at the broken recorder
i guess we caught you at a bad time
rodriguez spins around
vic steps into the moonlight streaming in through the window
behind him is cutless supreme
but we all have problems
rodriguez suddenly yells and charges them
he tackles vic
but in the darkness we cant see anything
until the explosion of a gun and the flash of flames lights up the room
a moment of silence then oh shit
you shot him you fuckin shot him
two men stumble to the door
leaving one on the floor
the door is flung open and vic runs out
followed by cutless supreme
the crime scene is swarming with cops dea and fbi
the task of evidence collection in progress
rodriguez body on the floor
agent simms is standing over the body with agent sarkasian
divinci musta figured it
i didnt think hed kill his own partner though
hes an animal
dea agent hooper comes up behind simms
recorders busted up
but we might be able to salvage some of the tape
i want him
you understand me i dont care what it takes
i want that sonuvabitch
simms heads for the door
sarkasian and hooper follow
a car pulls up in front
it is deadly quiet
we pan slowly around the office until we find manny in his chair sprawled back
continuing to pan until we see cynthia sprawled on the couch
but no signs of blood
just the bodies
the door opens
two men enters
all we see are guns in hands
cynthia and manny wake up with a start
manny is scared
who the fuckre you
a badge comes out
and now we see agents hooper and sarkasian
wed like you to come with us
cynthia looks at manny
this was the big secret
youre an asshole
cynthia puts her coat on and heads for the door
manny doesnt know what the hell is going on
cynthia is in with agents simms hooper and sarkasian
who set it up
i dont know
it was divinci wasnt it
i dont know
which one pulled the trigger
divinci or rodriguez
i dont know
agent simms looks right into cynthias eyes
detective rodriguez is dead
he was shot in the head last night
this gets cynthias attention
rodriguez was wearing a recorder
divinci found it
you can do addition cant you
youre full of shit
just tell us what you know
cynthia looks at both of them
we dont know
but were gonna find him
youre gonna find him
smiles sarcastically right
i dont know a fuckin thing
simms stares at her for a moment then turns to hooper and nods
hooper takes cynthias arm and leads her out of the office
when the door closes get a copy of the tape to bailor
but make sure it doesnt come from us
cynthia is alone in her cell
we hear footsteps
she looks up as the guard approaches
your attorneys here
cynthia enters the office
the guard shuts the door
cynthia finds herself facing arthur baylor
a tape recorder on the table in front of him
please sit down
i got nothin to say
so im told
arthur pushes the tape recorder and we hear take off your shirt
fuck you you dont trust me
im askin you one more time
you wanna shoot me
okay im sorry
im fuckin nervous
lets just get it over with
ill just feel a whole lot better when shes dead
then were off the hook
arthur watches cynthias reaction to when shes dead
but cynthia has seen enough not to be too shocked by anything
and her reaction is subtle
she knows better than to reveal what shes really feeling and thinking
i am im a fuckin rat
i traded you frank i fuckin traded you
simms knows everything
just fuckin shoot me get it the fuck over with
i deserve it
i youre fuckin right
the recording ends
arthur shuts off the machine
i think you know my client is innocent
thats all i care about my client
but i understand why youre scared
youre already facing perjury charges
my guess is your involvement is deeper than that
but i dont really care im not after you
i get nothing if you go to jail
but i think if i help you i can help my client
william joe didnt do it did he
cynthia hesitates then shakes her head
why dont you sit down
a beat then cynthia pulls up a chair
no goddamn way
im not going to grant that whore immunity
she lied on the stand shes protecting somebody
and shes involved
i want them all
arthur who was sitting across from him stands
before i leave let me remind you that you have shit for a case
if you really care about seeing justice for your dead agent dont blow this deal
immunity for her testimony is a small price for a bad cop
its the only way shes going to talk
simms glares at arthur
and william mccall walks right now all charges dropped
simms hesitates then if what she says is any good ill deal
if it isnt then nobody goes anywhere
cynthia is lead down the hall by guards
they enter an office
agents simms hooker sarkasian and two technicians are waiting inside with arthur
cynthia is lead into the room
the guards withdraw closing the door
cynthia looks at the men then at the tape recording equipment on the table and the empty chair
a microphone is waiting
cynthia looks at arthur then sits down in the chair
reporters swarm around arthur and joe as they exit the courthouse
how does it feel to be a free man again
arthur and joe head down the steps to a waiting limousine
do you remember everything that happened to you
what are your plans
i just want to go back to work
as a surgeon
what about the signed confession did the police coerce you into signing it
im sorry no more questions
they get into the back of the waiting limo and it pulls away
nathan is in the back staring at joe
arthur sits next to joe
good to have you back will
id like to make one stop
the limousine is parked curbside
nathan and arthur wait
watching joe walk across the lawn
he stops looking down
the grave stones are for his wife and two children
he sits down beside them
its very near where agent hudd was buried
giant party in progress
expensive cars parked along the drive
filled with well wishers in tuxes and gowns
arthur bailor and elliot in attendance
elliot isnt used to this much glory but hes taking credit where where he can with one of the pretty young women
you know it just didnt make sense a man wanting to be punished for a crime
how many times does that happen
once in a lifetime i can tell you
camera moves to arthur who is also receiving his share of the credit
to tell the truth i had no other witnesses to refute her testimony
but she didnt know that
all we knew was that she was reluctant to testify
you look for signs
and camera continues to joe and nathan
my god we thought you were dead you know
its just incredible that youre here
life moves in such strange ways
oh i just think what mightve happened to you had you not been arrested for killing that poor policeman
you still might be on the street
joe just takes it all in smiling and nodding
joe you look wonderful
after what youve been through
i just cant imagine
when youre ready to come back to work let me know
ive already spoken to the board theyre ready to re certify you anytime
i can put you in the emergency sector until you get warmed up
we all want you back
we cant afford to waste someone of your talent
a beat then joe smiles
a black tuxedo wipes past camera as we black screen
we hear the pounding of the music a familiar rhythm
and in graffiti across the screen the neon blares as usual
and theres cynthia
back bumping and grinding to the music
he life hasnt changed at all
and she knows it
but theres nothing else she can do
shuts the door
tries the light
it doesnt go on
suddenly a man is next to her i guess you had no choice
cynthia tries to move but a hand grabs her arm
and now we see divinci
he looks like hell
a man on the run
desperate and dangerous
he hasnt shaved
his clothes are filthy
he looks like
cynthia looks up at him
you had to do the right thing
what dyou want
what do i want
divinci suddenly shoves her hard across the room
whyre you asking me that
you gonna grant me three wishes
i dont know where to start
money would be nice
love would be better
but a little loyalty
you can never get enough of that
moves up to her but well start with
divinci pushes her into the bedroom
cynthia goes to her closet pulls out a box opens it
its got her savings
this is all ive got
divinci grabs the money and stuffs it into his jacket pocket
theyll catch you
i dont think so
you wanna bet
they dont have a clue baby
and you wanna know why
because i am following my heart
divinci puts aside his gun
and pushes cynthia down on the bed
he leans in close to her
face to face
and they dont know where that is
so tell me about your plans
i think id like to hear em now
divinci looks at cynthia for a moment almost with remorse
loyalty is what it all comes down to
nothing holds together when its gone
and once its gone you dont ever get it back
you shouldntve told em
i shouldntve done a lotta things in my life
but thats not one of em
let me tell you something
the only difference between a liar and a witness is that just one of em knows what hes doing
it is dark and quiet
no clue as to whats going on inside
and we hold on this for a long moment
just wondering whats she being made to do
and then theres a muffled boom
divinci exits the bedroom quickly
he is upset
we hear the door close
fall like snow flakes on cynthias body draped across the bed
the pillow on the floor beside her with the stuffing blown out
she has a hole in her chest right above her heart
manny unlocks the door enters his office
shut the door and lock it
manny looks toward the voice
divinci is sitting on the floor out of sight
holding his revolver
you scared the shit outa me
lock the door
manny locks the door
one more favor manny
since when did i become such a good guy
im takin some time off
i want a car here tonight and a driver
you can do that for your old friend right
disgusted yeah i can do that
but you are a hot fuckin potato
and drivers that dont talk dont come cheap
i got the money
just put it together
an ambulance races up to the emergency entrance
two paramedics push the gurney down the hall
cynthia is conscious on the gurney
looking up at the ceiling
she is fading
we hear come on hang in there hold on
cynthias moving p
v of the ceiling and faces
the gurney pushes past and camera picks up two surgeons moving out of an operating room
pulling off masks and rubber gloves bloody from surgery
one of them is joe
the other surgeon pats him on the back
just like riding a bike
joe finally breathes a sigh of relief and manages a smile
pulls up in front of the office
manny is looking out the window
leather upholstery moon roof cd
what more could you ask for
divinci looks out
gun in hand
hes cleaned himself up
hes now wearing a hawaiian shirt slacks
better not be a set up
want me to hold your hand
just walk me to the door
the lincoln idles at the curb
divinci and manny exit the office
divinci glances up and down the street as they move toward the car
manny opens the back door
i think ill let you live
you are a real prince
now how about my money
divinci hands manny a wad of cash from his pocket then gets into the back of the car
you never saw me
dont i wish that were true
he closes the door
the lincoln pulls away
manny watches it move off down the street
have a nice trip
divinci in the back
can only see the drivers eyes in the rear view mirror
get on the interstate
dont break the speed limit
divinci settles into the leather seat
looks at the rear view mirror
you know the one thing about life
you can never lose your sense of humor
without it you got nothin
suddenly the driver turns around holding a mm and fires
divincis head snaps back as the back window blows out of the lincoln
and now we recognize the driver
its clyle d
moves right into camera
bright headlights filling the screen
the car stops
we hear the door open and running feet
and pan into the bright headlights glaring into camera
shining brightly into camera
run the cardioplegia
we recognize joe and one of the friends from the party sinclair
go on bypass
faces move away as we hear medical machines in operation
a nurse reappears
camera moves back now revealing the room
and the operation in progress
a nurse hands him forceps just like old times
i wouldnt have done this without you
i owe you
lucky to have a donor
never wouldve survived the night
have a suture ready
picks up suture i heard it was a cops heart
joe looks at the nurse
he was shot in the head a couple hours ago
they think it was gang related
the bright lights overhead bleed the scene to white and we crashing on white sand
panning with the clear blue water racing up the sand to a woman in a bathing suit sitting alone
we pan up her legs past her stomach to her chest where we see a scar above her heart
we continue up to her face now
staring out at the ocean
palm trees behind her
she leans back hands behind her and
her life has changed
