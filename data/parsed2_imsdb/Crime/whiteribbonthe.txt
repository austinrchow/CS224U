written by michael haneke a man is riding a dressage horse
we cant see his face
only his boots spurs whip the taut reins the horses foamy mouth the movements that steer the animal
we watch him for a while and hear the snorts of the horse the dull sound of the hooves on the ground the fast uttered commands of the rider
then we start to hear a gentle voice narrator o
i dont know if the story that i want to tell you reflects the truth in every detail
much of it i only know by hearsay and a lot of it remains obscure to me even today and i must leave it in darkness
many of these questions remain without answer
but i believe i must tell of the strange events that occurred in our village because they may cast a new light on some of the goings on in this
the rider is the village doctor a gaunt intellectual looking man of around who has finished his dressage session and now rides toward the open gate beside the camera goes
through it and into the landscape
we see him in the avenue now visible behind him and watch him grow smaller until he vanishes
everything began if i remember correctly with the doctors riding accident
after his dressage session in the manors riding school he was first headed for his home
the garden opens up on the meadows and fields of the flat countryside
the doctor lies beside his wounded horse
his arm is strangely twisted his broken collarbone has made a bump in the blood drenched jacket
he yells with pain
after a few moments xenia the doctors year old daughter comes running out of the house
she rushes up to her father and looks at him horrified then at the twitching horse screams with horror
her father shouts something to her she bends over him and tries to raise him to his feet
he screams at her as hes in such pain
she staggers back helplessly he shouts something to her again whereupon she runs off
we hear all this from far away because during the whole scene the narrator has continued his tale narrator
to see if any of his patients had arrived
as it entered the property the horse had tripped over a hardly visible taut wire that had been strung between two trees
the doctors fourteen year old daughter had watched the accident from the window of the house and was able to inform the woman who was their neighbor who in turn
got the message to the manor house so that the agonizing doctor could be transported to the hospital of the district capital that was over kilometers away
emilie wagner a skinny modestly dressed woman in her late thirties hurries along the village street
the neighbor a single woman of around was the village midwife who had filled the invaluable position of housekeeper and receptionist for the doctor since the death of his wife
after tending to the doctors two children she had gone to the school to fetch her own son hans
since she didnt like leaving him alone she asked me in return for a small fee to keep him at the school with me every day after the other children
had finished their lessons
but on the day of the riding accident there was choir practice in the afternoon so that most of the children were still present
a few children pass emilie and greet her
then she reaches the school
the door is open
the schoolchildren stream out
we see the schoolteacher a slight man hardly years old talking inside to some of the older students
martin a tall gangly boy of around whose elegant clothes make him stand out among the other children coming out of the school turns to the midwife martin were you
at xenias place
hes interrupted by marie a delicate pretty and polite girl of around who has the odd characteristic of already behaving like an adult
marie cant you say hello
good afternoon mrs
wagner excuse me
midwife hello marie
marie were so worried you know
thats why martin forgot his manners
midwife thats all right
marie how is the doctor
midwife not very well
marie will he have to stay in the hospital
midwife i dont know
the midwife is tired of maries precocious and endless questions
she peers over the heads of children surrounding them looking for someone in the classroom
marie well take care of xenia
maybe we can help her somehow
midwife distracted good idea
itll cheer her up
she has seen her son whos coming out of the door he is a mongoloid boy of
his name is hans
he hesitates as he sees his mother surrounded by the others
the midwife leaves the group and goes over to him
midwife well did you enjoy the singing
hans nods eagerly it was great
the schoolteacher comes in
schoolteacher show your mother what youve been singing
hans looks doubtfully first at the schoolteacher then at his mother who nods at him encouragingly
after hesitating for a second he starts to sing hans la
marie turns to leave
marie good bye sir
good bye mrs
her saying good bye acts as an invitation to the other children they also say good bye though some less distinctively and follow the girl
tracking shot with the children
after a short distance georg a strong boy of around shouts encouraging the others georg last one is a rotten egg
then he sprints off
most of the children follow him
but marie and some of the other kids merely walk off at a brisk pace
the camera that stopped when georg ran off now follows marie so that after a while the others can be seen again at the far end of the street
xenia who is herself in a pitiful condition holds her four year old brother rudolph on her knees
she rocks him and herself back and forth
as his head is bowed we can only guess that hes crying
after a while xenia quietly if you want i can cut out some animals for you as i did last week
would you like that
rudolph shakes his head faintly
we could color them together no
or we could cut them from the lovely colored paper
the golden one do you remember
the one i got for easter
xenia ends up pressing her head helplessly against her little brothers head and mutters come on come on
they remain that way for a while
finally xenia raises rudolph high enough so she can stand up all right
now im going to make us something to eat
wagner has prepared everything i
rudolph interrupts her softly his head still bowed what if he never comes back
xenia as if she hasnt understood what
rudolph merely shakes his bowed head
xenia kneels down in front of her brother and tries to look into his eyes but the boy bows his head even deeper
xenia tenderly come on
dont be stupid
it goes away just like the flu
remember last winter
you were very sick werent you
and then two weeks later
a noise makes her cock her ear its as if something had hit the window in the next room
xenia stands up and listens
and then after listening for a while once again the same noise
she goes into the other room and hiding behind the curtain looks out
outside the group of children are gathered around marie
they look up at the house
theyre waiting for something
after a while georg the boy who earlier had urged them to race throws another stone at the window
xenia is startled
finally she opens the window
georg hi xeni
xenia doesnt answer
after a while marie quietly how are you
can we help you
the steward of the estate a heavy set rustic man in his mid fifties is talking with the landowner whos about the same age
they are standing beside a team of carthorses
with a torch the steward lights up a dead horse that lies on the ground after being towed in by the carthorses
its tendons were almost severed
it never would have recovered
the landowner bends down and examines the wounds on the pasterns of the dead animals front legs
landowner how did that thing get there
didnt the doctor say anything
steward with a snicker he was in no mood to talk with his collarbone sticking out of his throat
i asked his daughter
she has no idea
he always rides through those trees
landowner did you look at the wire
steward of course
its thin but strong
you can hardly see it if you dont look closely
landowner but why was it tied there
steward shrugging and at knee height
i dont know
maybe so the kids could jump over it
i dont think the doctor himself was stupid enough to tie that thing there
steward meaning i dont know
anyway it was definitely put there intentionally and looks damn
sigi the year old son of the landowner stands at the window and watches his father and the steward standing in the torchlight beside the dead horse
in the background music piano violin
after a short while the two men down in the courtyard separate the landowner heads to the manor the steward with the team of carthorses to a farm building
sigi turns away from the window and looks into the room
there his mother beatrix a beautiful nervous woman in her late thirties is sitting at a baby grand piano
beside her stands the tutor holding a violin tucked under his chin
he looks as if hes in his late twenties plump and slightly greasy and obviously infatuated with his beautiful employer who has just interrupted her playing with an annoyed sigh
tutor im sorry madame
youre just playing too well for me
beatrix stop apologizing and concentrate
thatll be more helpful for both of us
tutor to tell the truth youre just playing too fast for me
im not paganini
beatrix looks up at him with a quick amused smile then turns back the pages of her sheet music
beatrix well lets start all over again at the letter d
the tutor does the same they glance at each other and start again
sigi watches them from the window then he saunters in stops some distance away and watches
then he saunters away again
suddenly beatrix stops playing again
beatrix listen darling
if you like the music then sit down beside me and turn the pages of the sheet music
but if youre bored go up to your room and at least stay out of my sight
it makes me nervous if youre constantly sauntering around in front of me
sigi bows his head ashamed but doesnt move
beatrix turning to the tutor by the way what time is it
where is the girl
the tutor pulls out his pocket watch
tutor shes with the twins i presume
twenty to nine
beatrix twenty to nine
turning to sigi you should have been in bed long ago
to the tutor has he done his homework
tutor of course madame
beatrix all right
to sigi well do you want to turn the pages for me or not
beatrix then come here
with a little caustic smile she taps beside her on the piano bench
sigi comes over sits down beside her and looks at the sheet music
beatrix turns the pages back
beatrix to the tutor all right here we go again the letter d
try to play a bit faster
or else i might as well play with the village schoolteacher
they play again
sigi reads the music with her then turns the page
marie and martin come through the door and stand in front of it
at the dinner table the pastor in his mid forties sits with his back to the door
in front of him at the other end of the table sits his wife anna a woman in her late forties
on the sides of the table sit the children anton magdalena katharina and florian
two other places are empty
the table is set for people but the plates are empty
marie quietly please forgive us
martin following her lead please forgive us
then the pastor speaks very quietly without turning to the two children pastor theres no question of forgiving
you havent offended me
its your mother and your brothers and sisters that you have frightened away and offended
ask them for forgiveness
you amaze me
i didnt know that the two oldest and therefore most reasonable of my children wouldnt mind frightening their mother and brothers and sisters to death
he turns around toward the two children are you now grown up enough to live on your own
do you want to leave home and start a life of your own
so you can come and go as you please and nobody gets in your way
is that what you want
the two remain silent their heads bowed
the pastor turns his back to them again and faces the table
nobody at this table has eaten tonight
when it grew dark and you hadnt returned your mother went all over the village in tears looking for you
do you really think we couldve enjoyed our meal if we feared something had happened to you
do you think we can enjoy our meal now when youve come back and dish up lies as an excuse
i dont know whats worse your absence or your coming back
tonight we shall all go to bed hungry
he stands up followed by the mother and the children who were sitting at the table
again he turns to the two wrongdoers pastor you probably agree with me that i cannot leave your offense unpunished if we want keep living in mutual respect
so tomorrow evening at this hour i shall give each of you strokes of the cane
until then you have time to ponder over your offense
do you agree with me
marie and martin yes father
pastor all right then
go to bed now all of you
the children who were sitting at the table go first to their mother then to their father
they kiss their hands and leave the room
as marie and martin want to do the same the father says pastor i refuse to be touched by you
your mother and i will sleep poorly because we know i have to hurt you tomorrow and because it will more painful to us than the strokes will be painful
leave us alone and go to bed
as the two children are about to leave the room he says pastor when you were small your mother once in a while would tie a ribbon in your hair
or around your arm
its white color was to remind you of innocence and purity
i thought that at your age you were well mannered enough to get by without such reminders
i was wrong
tomorrow once youve been purified by your punishment your mother will tie such a ribbon on you again and youll wear it until your behavior shows us that we can
trust you again
close angle one of the trees to which the wire was tied that tripped up the doctors horse
a policeman is looking for clues
with him are xenia rudolph the midwife and her son hans
the two boys dont show much interest in the investigation
they run after each other in the garden and the neighboring fields
hans especially seems enjoy this and is shrieking with delight
policeman where is the wire now
the midwife looks at xenia who shrugs her shoulders
policeman then who took it away
xenia i dont know
policeman you werent here
xenia uncertain looks at the midwife
policeman did you accompany your father
policeman that means you were here
xenia i was in school
policeman and when you left for school the wire was still here
xenia i didnt check
the policeman turns to the midwife policeman and when did you come
midwife at noon
i make lunch for the doctor and the kids
since the death of the doctors wife ive been helping him out
policeman since when
midwife its been years
since the birth of little rudolph
im the midwife here
we often work together
policeman but you didnt see anything
policeman do you have any idea how long the wire had been there
midwife id never seen it before
policeman angrily let me get this straight nobody saw the thing before nobody saw it afterwards
it wound itself around the two trees all alone and made itself vanish after the doctors fall
neither the midwife nor xenia know what to answer
at that moment hans comes running in from the field excited hans mother
midwife reluctantly whats happening
lots of people
midwife to the policeman sorry
indeed as the midwife sets outs for the field a group of people hurry along the path bordering the doctors property and cross our pov
they carry a body on a makeshift stretcher
the policeman and xenia follow the midwife
the group vanishes as quickly as it appeared behind the surrounding bushes
as the group was approaching we have been hearing narrator the day following the doctors riding accident not only brought no solution to the question of whod done it but
a second far more tragic incident almost made people forget the misfortune of the previous day the wife of a tenant farmer died in a work accident
its very dark in the low ceilinged room
a couple of women in peasant dresses take care of the dead woman whos been laid out on the bed
the women remove her clothes and wash her
narrator the woman who because of an injured arm could only do light work had been dispensed by the steward from harvesting chores and was assigned to easier work in
everything happens very silently
an elderly woman a midwife specialized in bathing takes care of the proceedings
every time the door is opened one hears the mutterings of the people waiting outside
soiled water is carried out new underwear brought in and the women start to clothe the naked corpse again
outside the sounds of excited voices are getting louder
then the door opens and the farmer around fifty enters the room
the old midwife turns around angrily bathing midwife you stay outside
i havent yet
farmer quietly get out
reluctantly the old midwife abandons her half completed work not without having spread the dress she had draped over the still half naked body of the dead woman
the other women follow her embarrassed
once the door has closed behind them the farmer just stands there
only after a long while does he move forward and sit beside his dead wife
he remains seated motionless
for a very long time
he only tugs once at the dress draped over the half naked body as if he wanted to cover a patch of nudity
then he just sits there again in the dark room and only his halting breath lets us know that any moment he may cry
with his net and his fishing rod the schoolteacher is landing a fish
narrator on the same day i had a strange encounter the weather was beautiful and hot so i decided to try and improve my meager menu with some brown trout
which are plentiful in the river
the landowner apparently liked me and allowed me to fish
suddenly the schoolteacher stops dead like a tightrope walker martin is walking along on the top of the wall of the bridge thirty feet above the riverbed
schoolteacher shouts fearful martin
the boy doesnt seem to hear him and keeps up his balancing act
schoolteacher louder martin
the boy keeps at it
the schoolteacher quickly wades ashore throws his fishing rod and the net and the wriggling fish on the gravel beside the river and climbs up the river bank
when he gets on top he sees the boy balancing himself at the other end of the bridge
schoolteacher martin be careful
the boy takes a few more steps then reaches the end of the wall and jumps down onto the bridge
hesitatingly he turns to the schoolteacher who comes toward him
schoolteacher are you completely insane
do you want to break your neck
martin his head bowed hello sir
the schoolteacher has reached him
schoolteacher whats happening
are you mad
dont you know how high that is
the boy remains silent keeping his head bent down
schoolteacher didnt you hear me
i shouted to you
martin after a short silence yes i did
the boy remains silent
keeping his head bowed the boy shrugs a little
the schoolteacher realizing that this wont get him any further tries again talking in a gentle voice schoolteacher you saw me down there and wanted to impress me
the boy shakes his head
schoolteacher well why didnt you
martin interrupting him i gave god an opportunity to kill me
he didnt do it
that means hes pleased with me
schoolteacher staggered what are you saying
martin he doesnt want me to die
schoolteacher bewildered who
who doesnt want you to die
schoolteacher why would god want you to die
the boy stops answering his head bowed again
the schoolteacher remains silent and looks at him for a while
then he adds softly promise me never to do such nonsense again
look at me
martin looks up reluctantly
promise it to me
martin remains silent
he doesnt dare look down and instead looks past the schoolteacher
you dont trust me dont you
martin polite emotionless yes i do sir
the schoolteacher realizes that theres no use in talking any further
schoolteacher concluding all right
go home now
ill be coming tomorrow for the piano lesson
ill talk to your father then
martin turns and faces the schoolteacher and says in such a pleading voice that it startles him martin please dont tell him
please sir dont
martin just looks pleadingly at the schoolteacher and shakes his head as if to stress his request
franz the farmer eldest son is searching for evidence of his mothers accident
he is accompanied by the neighbors son matti a slight boy of around
the sawmill is a ramshackle wooden building beside the river
matti who obviously was there when the accident happened shows franz the place
everythings rotten here
franz moves slowly forward
he looks down at the lower floor
immediately below the saw
franz steps back carefully and turns to matti franz who made her climb up here
matti i havent a clue
they told us to collect all the lose ends
she just climbed up there
franz she could never stand heights
it made her dizzy
who assigned you to this job
matti uneasy you know how it works
the sawmill needed to be cleaned up and the foremen pick the weaker harvesters franz who picked her
the schoolteacher with his fishing gear and several fish that he caught
narrator it was on my way home after the strange encounter with martin that i met eva for the first time
eva a redhead somewhat chubby but pretty girl crosses him way on her bicycle
a big bag is strapped to the baggage carrier
eva passing by hello
the schoolteacher stops turns to the girl schoolteacher hesitantly excuse me
eva off yes
schoolteacher embarrassed excuse me for accosting you this way
youre the new nanny of the barons children arent you
we hear the bicycle stopping
the schoolteacher has turned around and now moves toward the girl
schoolteacher they say youre from oberdorf
eva who says that
schoolteacher folks around here
i dont know

i just thought i
i dont know he laughs embarrassed when i saw you i thought

eva i know
schoolteacher confused what
eva the baroness already told me
schoolteacher what did she tell you
eva that the schoolteacher is from the village next to mine
schoolteacher laughs oh i see
he points at the bag on the baggage carrier you look as if youre going there
schoolteacher back home
eva doesnt understand what hes referring to yes
schoolteacher are you going there
eva yes i am
schoolteacher doesnt know what to say well i thought
since youll cycle through our village
you might perhaps
hes thinking looks down and sees the fish
say hello to my father and laughing at his own idea he holds up a fish bring him one of the fishes
i just caught them
now eva laughs too
schoolteacher smiling as if to apologize well
im sure hed be delighted
especially as its the start of the weekend
she nods at the fish
the absurdity of the suggestion amuses her
at the same time she doesnt really know how to behave
eva well how
the schoolteacher holds up the fish laughs as if he himself doesnt how he got this idea
schoolteacher i dont know either
unfortunately i have nothing to wrap them in
the both laugh
then the girl points at the bag on the baggage carrier of her bicycle and says regretfully eva neither have i
the schoolteacher has a new idea schoolteacher amused i could give you some fishing line to tie them up
eva equally amused there on the bicycle
the schoolteacher shrugs his shoulders with a smile why not
eva i dont think thats a very good idea
schoolteacher youre right
it was just an idea
then schoolteacher is that your bicycle
eva what an idea
it belongs to the estate
schoolteacher i see
schoolteacher is this your first day off
eva rather suspicious because all this is too intimate for her yes
schoolteacher well youre probably looking forward to being at home
eva yes i am
schoolteacher i can imagine
then eva says putting the pedals and handlebar in a ready to leave position well
ive still a long way to go
schoolteacher stepping back of course
well good bye
eva good bye
shes about to ride off
schoolteacher with a smile if you cycle through grundbach and see my father at least say hello to him from me
eva i dont know your father
schoolteacher thats true
they look at each other for a while and then eva rides off
the camera follows her
eva and the bicycle are tottering a bit
the girl looks around and shouts laughing eva i only learned to ride a bicycle today
schoolteacher now o
also shouting well youre doing fine
but be careful
as she picks up speed eva rides better and soon is just a speck on the dusty country road
its still too early to switch on the light
xenia and little rudolph are sitting in the kitchen eating

then rudolph and mom
she didnt go on a trip
rudolph is she dead too

but that was a long time ago
both remain silent
in the meantime it has grown dark in the kitchen
suddenly rudolph brushes away his plate off the table with an angry movement and turns away from xenia
the plate shatters on the floor
at first xenia is stunned paralyzed
then she starts to sob but tries to hide it from her brother
while we hear the sounds of the punishment and the children being beaten counting the strokes with increasing moans and stifled whining we see close angles the faces of the
other brothers and sisters
some have turned away their faces and others start to cry with pity and fear
finally both have received their strokes
close angle the pastor
he is breathless and beads of sweat on his forehead
he hands martin the cane
close angle martin
here take the cane and put it back in its place
as martin is about to go his father goes on but first you can thank me for trying to protect you from any further misconduct
close angle marie

today was a very sad day in my life and i hope for all of us that it doesnt happen again
close angle both kiss their fathers hand
close angle the pastor
pastor smiles and now hug me
theres nothing we have to forgive each other anymore
i love you with all my heart
he first hugs marie who her face still wet with tears tries a forced smile and then martin
then the pastor turns to his wife pastor now the ribbon anna
anna goes toward the two children tying a white ribbon around martins upper arm and another in maries hair
pastor this will remain on you until were all sure you have learned how to fight bad thoughts and manners
youre well aware this year you will receive christs body in the form of bread and wine
until then strive to be free of sinful thoughts
now lets eat
martin carries the cane out of the room
the pastor and the other children sit around the table
marie leaves the room with her mother
after all the others have sat down and put their plates back where they were before the punishment the two come back with two soup bowls and put them on
martin has also come back and sits down at his place beside his father
the pastor folds his hands in prayer the others follow suit
pastor very friendly marie would you say grace today
marie smiling eagerly with pleasure father
she bows her head so do the others
marie come lord jesus and be our guest and bless what youve given to us
blessed be this meal
the others blessed be this meal
the mother and marie open the soup tureens and hand out the soup
then they eat
the body of the farmers wife has been laid out
the candles to its left and right are almost burnt out
its very quiet
little five year old sepp sneaks into the room bare foot and wearing a shirt
then slowly and carefully he comes over to his dead mother
he ends up standing beside the bed
the face of the dead woman is covered with a white handkerchief
sepp is very frightened
he makes several attempts before he dares to lift the handkerchief
then he watches her breathless his eyes and mouth wide open
suddenly startled by a noise he jerks back
he turns around his year old brother paul is sitting on a bench against the wall
he too only wears a shirt
sepp surprised with a whispering voice pauli
paul doesnt say a word
sepp doesnt know what to do
he looks at his mother again then again at his brother
he goes over to him and sits beside him on the bench
like birds in a cage they remain seated in the dark
very close together
the steward and his children liesl georg and ferdinand are waiting for something
then the door opens and the midwife comes out
she tells them to come into the other room
narrator that night the wife of the steward gave birth to her fourth and last child at the age of
the children want to follow their father
at least liesl a chubby and good natured teenager rather plain cant wait to go in
but the midwife tells them to be patient and only the father is let through

instead of the father georg hits his brother on the back of the head

she steps in and distributes a few smacks
liesl runs out of the room howling
midwife you should be ashamed
ferdinand suddenly as if hed become another person sorry
the midwife looks at him confused
the farmer franz and paul leave the farm they go to work
the two oldest carry scythes
in the background vast fields of crops
the three walk hurriedly
after a while franz hesitantly father i have to tell you something
farmer what is it
franz i went to the sawmill
the farmer keeps on walking as if he hasnt heard
franz looks at him from the side
for a long moment he remains silent while all three keep walking
then franz goes on softly the floor on the first level where mother worked was totally rotten
they keep on walking
the steward who sent her there must have known it
and the landowner too
the farmer remains silent
they keep walking
farmer hostile what do you want
franz doesnt understand his fathers refusal they sent her there knowing it was dangerous
the farmer stops turns to franz farmer aggressive what are you getting at
franz doesnt understand but
farmer furious but with forced calm do you want me to sue the baron
or kill the steward

he turns away from franz and keeps on walking
the others follow
after a few steps franz softly i think our father loved our mother
suddenly the farmer stops and screams almost crying with fury and despair farmer shut up
close angle paul
he was listening carefully the whole time
he looks at the father
then lowers his eyes
narrator after these two days in july life in the village returned to what it had always been
even teenagers and children are used to tie the sheaves and to do other easier jobs
the daily harvesting drove the people almost to exhaustion
most of the children were busy helping their parents
b the midwife is doing housework in the doctors house
a quarrel between her retarded son and the year old rudolph that we barely can follow due to the narrators voice o
is settled by the midwife in favor of her son
for the time being the doctor remained in the hospital
in the meantime the midwife catered the basic needs of xenia and rudolph his two children
after the burial of the farmers wife that was attended by the whole village the two accidents were soon forgotten
until the harvest festival at the end of the summer brought the whole village together again first in a festive hustle and bustle and then in horror and perplexity
the courtyard is full of people dressed in their sunday best farmers seasonal workers people from the village children and teenagers
a dance hall has been set up
on it we see the landowner the steward and the pastor with their families
a couple of younger women a delegation of the harvesters goes over to present the harvest crown to the landowner
with our songs and our prayers weve gathered the rye and given that crown to your lordship
it is not big it is not small but pretty nice and fine
not with thistles or thorns is it made but with pure grain
had our lordship sowed more the men wouldve scythed more and we girls gathered more
we girls have gathered the grain over mountains and valleys over thistles and thorn over the fields of our lordship
i wish our lordship a happy life as many years as theres sand on the beach as many years as there are drops in the rain so much may our
lordship be blessed
and as a reward to be of good cheer wed like for our folks a barrel of beer and if we could have a fried goose perchance then well all
be ready to dance
during the poem the camera has shown all those we have met until now
they have all except for the doctor the farmer and his two eldest sons come to the feast
while all the folks present laugh and shout the maid with a clumsy curtsy hands over the harvest crown to the baron
the village band plays a fanfare
as soon as the hullabaloo has died down baron answering my thanks to all of you
thank you very much
you have worked well and the heavens were merciful and now the barns are full
therefore theres more than enough beer and you wont starve today
he points to the open barn where food and beer are waiting
in front of the barn are tables with long benches
baron enjoy your meal
eat and drink as much as you wish
you deserve it
again the people yell and cheer
then the music starts and the feast is off and running
the vegetable garden is at the back of the manor house
in the distance we hear the music from the feast
franz in working clothes comes over opens a gate in the fence then goes to a large field with the cabbages and slices them all off with his scythe
the whole scene looks like a mass execution
the party is in full swing people dance and shout children run around young men quarrel and show off in front of the young girls
older women are stand around in groups gossiping
some farmers are gathered around the landowner he is friendly with them but we dont understand what theyre talking about
his wife with her nervous frailty looks out of place in this crowd
shes talking to the schoolteacher
didnt you promise us a little chorale sung by your proteges
schoolteacher you have to talk to the pastor baroness
were still busy studying the choir pieces for the confirmation feast
beatrix amused but thats in spring my dear
this is the start of autumn
schoolteacher smiles embarrassed i know but unfortunately not all of our little singers are very musical
im sorry if
a quieter part of the estate
under a big shadowy tree we see the two strollers of the landowners family a small table and a few chairs
eva is sitting beside the twins and watches the colorful bustle
sitting beside her turning her back to the manor is emma the stewards wife who is breastfeeding her baby
the steward separates from a group of men and comes over to the two women
as he comes over he shouts to them steward well you two mothers
dont you want to be part of the festivities
eva looks at the stewards wife not knowing how to react to the mother joke
but the slightly naive wife of the steward is basically fond of any jokes her husband cracks
she turns halfway to him and says emma its so nice here in the shade
in the meantime the steward has come over
hes smoking a pipe
steward in excellent mood well our son seems to be enjoying that right
steward i can imagine
who wouldnt like that
emma rebuking him gently georg
steward to eva what about you
dont you get bored taking care of other peoples children with all the young lads over there
eva uneasy with forced sweetness no sir i love to be with the children
he gives his wife a short glance then sits on a chair beside eva how old are you anyway
eva eighteen sir
and you want me to believe youd rather hold the baronesss baby in your arms than your true love
emma good naturedly come on georg leave her alone
steward im not doing her any harm
can you get us something to eat emma
eva stands up to emma if you mind the children for a moment ill get us something
steward stands up too dont worry princess im going
not to panic
a bunch of children between and dressed up in their sunday best among them marie and martin both wearing their white ribbons the pastors other children xenia rudolph as well
as hans liesl georg ferdinand and sigi
they leave the manor and head toward the fields
as they pass by the vegetable garden they notice the sliced off cabbages and stop
some laugh at it others are unsettled
most of the children keep run on out into the open fields
farmhands and tenant farmers are eating at the tables
one of them tells a story that we only partially understand because of all the noise first tenant farmer
so the guy really tried to steal the rooster from the steeple
he was already completely pickled but even then they couldnt stop him
a huge massive guy you see
so they just let him go saying to themselves if he falls down he falls down thats it
but he didnt get much farther than the first window thats where the trellis ends see
and even with all his strength he couldnt hoist himself up on the lightning rod
so the guy stands up there in the window
and what do you think that idiot does he starts to crow
he crows shouting im the rooster on the steeple
youll never catch me
he made such a commotion that little by little the people in the neighborhood started to wake up
at the same time someone else starts to shout causing the others to join in farmhands and farmers more beer more beer or ill fall down hurray
more beer more beer or ill fall down
has the landlord hung himself that he doesnt serve me any beer
more beer more beer or ill fall down
leni franzs sister and another farmgirl do their best to cater to the drinkers thirst as fast as possible
the two young women try to keep their spirits up but the guests indelicate jokes and rude gestures dont make it easy
leni im coming
i havent got a magic wand
first farmhand with a grin shall i help you leni
id love to help you
second farmhand also grinning what do you want to help her with
first farmhand all over
front and backside
third farmhand to leni are you as slow with the baron
second tenant farmer come on leave her alone second farmhand you like her that much
go and help her
fourth farmhand sitting beside the second almost in a whisper dont you know it was her mother who had that accident
at the same time a boy of ten comes over to the first farmer and butts in to his story boy father they cut off the barons cabbages
first tenant farmer whats that
boy grin they cut off the barons cabbages
leni whos just putting some glasses with beer on the table glares at the boy flabbergasted
on the dance floor eva and the schoolteacher try to dance
neither is very talented
eva keeps looking at her feet and smiles embarrassed
eva i never learned it
schoolteacher also with a smile neither did i
you just have to count out loud
their steps are far too big
they look clumsy and embarrassed but happy
after a few spins eva arent you afraid your students might laugh at you when they see you dancing with me that way sir
schoolteacher laughs theyd better not
and stop being so formal with me
im not that old am i
eva laughs embarrassed and looks down
schoolteacher you see were getting better
schoolteacher stop looking at your feet
she lifts her head looks at him and
they laugh and start again
music of the village band can be heard coming from the manor
the baroness reaches the vegetable garden followed by the pastors wife the tutor and some ladies from the village
behind the fence among the beheaded cabbages are the baron the steward and some farmers
a couple of curious onlookers have gathered by the fence
mutters and now and then laughter
the baron turns to his wife and with a snicker points to the heads lying around him
baron quite a job isnt it
the baroness looks at the extent of the disaster
then says revolted baroness this is disgusting
the steward comes over to them and with a little grin comments on the sensitivity of his masters steward it used to be an old custom he quotes now that
the harvestings done its time to pay us every one any miser who leaves us in a rut he shall have his cabbage cut
the baroness who doesnt think the symbolic character of the deed is funny at all looks briefly at him and then back again at the cabbage cemetery
suddenly she turns away and leaves the scene headed toward the manor
she makes her way through the bystanders who step aside to let her through
the pastor works at his desk
suddenly a knock on the door pastor looking up come in florian comes hesitantly through the door
pastor what do you want
florian shy almost frightened id like to ask you something father
the boy comes over to the desk opens a few buttons of his shirt and then seizes something inside
in the open shirt we see the head of a little bird
pastor so what
florian i have found it
pastor what do you want
florian pleadingly may i keep it
the pastor is moved by the request of his youngest son but manages to hide his emotion skillfully
pastor how do you plan to do that
florian well heal it
pastor softly and when its healed
florian looks at him with round eyes he doesnt know what to answer
the pastor continues dont you think youll be attached to it then
will you let it fly away
florian thinks then nods toward a cage behind the desk
florian pipsi also lives in a cage
the pastor looks at the cage shortly hides a smile and turns to florian again pastor yes but pipsi grew up in captivity
nodding at florians bird this one is used to living in freedom
florian doesnt know what to answer
so he merely looks at his father with pleading eyes
pastor repeats will you set him free as soon hes healed
florian looks down and nods with a heavy heart
pastor have you already asked mother
florian nods eagerly
what did she say
florian she said it was for father to decide
pastor smiling faintly thats what she said
florian nods eagerly and looks at his father with eyes that are pleading with expectation
pastor youll really to take care of it
thats a heavy responsibility
you know that dont you
sensing that his father is not quite against it florian nods eagerly
youre its father and mother now
florian nods yet more eagerly if thats possible
the pastor finds it difficult not to smile well have to find a cage for your patient
florian can hardly believe it
hed like to fling his arms around his fathers neck but doesnt dare
so he just keeps standing there beaming
florian thanks father
leni comes along the track excited
she s almost running
she reaches the farm and disappears inside
the family is eating
theyre in working clothes since they didnt attend the thanksgiving feast
only leni who visibly just came into the room is still wearing the clothes she wore at the feast
shes out of breath and very excited
the farmer looks very concerned
farmer to franz is that true
franz hostile keeps on eating i dont know nothing
farmer threatening is that true
franz looks at him aggressively nothing is true
and even if it was true so what
serves him right that miser
farmer trying to control himself did you do it or did you not do it
franz doesnt answer and keeps on eating
leni it seems somebody saw you
for a moment franz remains calm then he bursts out franz to leni so what
they should be glad that they still have their own heads
to the farmer and i want you to know this father im proud of it
the father responds to this by slapping his face hard
franz jumps up
farmer orders franz without looking at him sit down
for a moment we dont know how franz will behave
sitting on the corner bench hes jammed between his father and his brothers and sisters who stare at the table embarrassed
only paul who sits opposite his brother looks up at him
franz finally sits down again
the farmer stares at his plate tries to speak softly which is obviously difficult for him to judge by the sound of his voice
farmer what did you intend to do
as franz doesnt answer he looks up right into franzs face who avoids his fathers eyes
farmer tell me
franz keeps on glaring straight ahead
the farmer adopts a gentler tone
tell me franz who can hardly speak you know why father
farmer after a pause because of your mother
because you feel theyre responsible for her death
is that it
what do you think
that im not man enough to settle this
its that what you think
franz keeps on glaring remaining silent
the father tries to stay calm staring straight ahead
he takes a spoon and eats twice from the milk soup
he puts down the spoon and looks at franz again
did you ever think of what your behavior can mean for the whole family
if leni loses her job which enables us to keep our heads above water for the whole year
what if we cant work there anymore during the summer
franz makes an impatient movement takes raises his spoon and wants to go on eating
the farmer grabs his arm and slams it down
the two stare at each other
for a moment we dont know what will happen
then the farmer goes on you want to marry and take over the farm in two years
and how will you feed them all he points with his head at the other children without the help of the manor tell me
franz turns his head away
he disagrees but does not know what to answer
the farmer goes on and how do you know theyre responsible
franz turns to him abruptly franz and how do you know theyre innocent
the farmer looks at franz with round eyes
a long pause follows
then the farmer says quietly i dont know
and after another pause
farmer but i dont know the opposite either
the baron stands at the bottom and shouts up at the tutor whos standing on the stairs baron
what do you mean not there
tutor sheepish he
i ve already looked everywhere
i cant find him
he cant have vanished into thin air
when did you see him last
tutor as above around oclock
baron his anger mounting around two
do you know what time it is
tutor guiltily i know sir
furious the landowner turns away from the nincompoop pensive
then he turns to the tutor again baron what does my wife say doesnt she have any clue
tutor madame sent me to you baron
she is beside herself with fear
baron wryly i can imagine
looks up to the tutor youre an idiot huber
why do you think youre here
to take care of a single child
is that such a hard task
tutor softly im awfully sorry baron
baron youre even too stupid for that
the baron turns away and heads for the door
then he turns around again and asks baron where did you see my son for the last time
tutor outside in the courtyard
he said he was going to play with the other children
tutor that he didnt say
baron and my wife didnt notice anything either
tutor after that business with the cabbage heads madame retired to her room
she was indisposed
baron sarcastically indisposed
she had a terrible migraine attack
baron almost to himself my god this place is a zoo
he turns away and goes out into the courtyard
the tutor follow him with his eyes
he feels hes being badly treated and hates the baron for his insults
finally he goes back up the stairs
the torches of the feast have almost burned out
here and there we see some lanterns put there to facilitate the cleaning up
coming from the front door the baron crosses the vast courtyard
half way across he screams baron braker
the steward is overseeing a dozen farmhands who are putting the tables and the benches of the feast back the barn
he walks toward the baron
have you seen my son
steward surprised no
baron quietly could you please ask your boys
apparently sigi has disappeared with a whole bunch of kids
shouting to the farmhands when youre finished with the cleaning up wait for me
theres still a job to do
get some fresh torches and lanterns
baron in the meantime ill go round up the men
the steward goes to his house the baron to the outbuildings
there he switches on the siren
narrator the stewards children said they had seen sigi only for a short time that he had gone off with other kids and that they didnt pay much attention to
many men of different ages with lanterns and torches
the baron makes a short speech and the steward assigns the areas to be searched
most of this is drowned out by the narrators voice
the search began shortly after midnight
before the baron had ridden to the rectory
but there he found out nothing new from the children who had been specially woken up
the searchers who were tired and some of whom were still drunk were divided into two groups one group started to search all the buildings on the estate one by
one while the others combed the surrounding areas
it was around half past two when some members of the search party had already preferred to lie down somewhere and to sleep off their drunkenness that the siren suddenly
sounded again calling the men back to the courtyard
the men come in with a stretcher
they had found sigi
he had been tied up in the old sawmill upside down
his trousers had been pulled down and his buttocks were bleeding from cane strokes
he seemed to be in a state of shock was unable to walk and had to be brought back to the manor on a makeshift stretcher lying on his belly
the room is packed
the whole village is gathered
narrator the next sunday the baron at the end of the service asked the pastor if he could say a few words baron you all know now what was done
to my son siegmund
policemen from the district town were here this week
they questioned many of you
but to no avail
first i thought that the people who tortured my child were the same people who cut off my familys cabbage heads
unrest in the attendance
because they wanted to get even
get even for what
because their mother had died while she was working in the sawmill and it was supposedly my fault which is an absurd assertion
the farmer leni and the other children are there with the exception of franz
the unrest grows
at least thats what franz felder gave as the motive for his mowing prowess when the policemen arrested him
i have always supported the farmer felder and his family but one cant always expect people to be grateful
thats a matter of character
the farmer wants to leave the church
baron dont run away felder
its your honor i want to salvage
it has turned out that the valiant franz felder has been boasting of his feat in front of his fiancee
then the coward that he is hid among his family and so he didnt have time to torture my son
and theres one thing i know for sure the senior felder would rather bite off his tongue than cover for his wayward son
may i remind you something what most of you have already forgotten
almost two months ago the doctor had a riding accident and he has still not returned from the hospital
this accident was caused by a wire that had been strung in his garden with the explicit intent of bringing him down
and in that case too nobody knows anything saw anything or heard anything
disconcerted mutter among the attendance
we all know that the people responsible for the terrible injuries suffered by my son and those suffered by the doctor are sitting here among us in this room
i wont tolerate that crimes of this nature go unpunished
i dont wish something similar to happen to any of your children
thats why i call upon you all to help me find the culprit or the culprits
ask questions keep your ears open be watchful
if we fail to find out the truth the peace within our community will be gone
thank you pastor
the pastor says a few last words which we dont grasp that the narrators voice drowns out
the people file out of the church quietly and slowly but talking worriedly to each other
narrator the landowners speech frightened the people
most knew about the incident at the thanksgiving feast
but the majority didnt know exactly what had happened and in the end they didnt care
the baron was not really popular among the people but he was respected as a powerful social figure as well as the employer of nearly the whole village
the people are leaving the church groups are forming
as the farmer felder and his children come out theyre shunned
gauntlet down the village street
the camera follows
his threat about loosing the peace of the community couldnt mean anything good
at the same time the mysterious character of what were obviously criminal deeds fed the mistrust of the farmers deeply rooted since time immemorial
the empty classroom
on the harmonium a petroleum lamp
the schoolteacher is playing
after a while someone knocks at the door
the schoolteacher stops
schoolteacher surprised come in
the door opens hesitantly
in the dark eva hardly recognizable because shes so far from the lamp
schoolteacher surprised and glad eva
eva hardly understandable may i come in
the schoolteacher stands up goes toward and laughing with surprise says to her
schoolteacher what a question
eva enters the room and closes the door behind her
shes carrying a suitcase
shyly she looks around and doesnt say a word
schoolteacher come over here
its so dark
he moves toward the lamp and waits half way because she doesnt follow
schoolteacher whats going on
eva they fired me
schoolteacher startled what do you mean
she shrugs her shoulders
they just threw me out pause then the tutor has also been fired
suddenly in the middle of a sentence she bursts into floods of tears
at the same time she turns away from the schoolteacher
he goes over to her and stops in front of her but is too shy to touch her
suddenly she turns to him again and says sobbing i dont know where to go
i cant go back home in the middle of the night
im afraid to walk on the road all alone
schoolteacher calming her down dont worry
try to calm down
theres nothing to worry about
eva sobbing childish there is
schoolteacher with a calming smile come here and sit down
please calm down and then tell me what happened
shes sits down on the school bench beside her
the schoolteacher sits on his haunches in front of her well
it takes her time to calm down
slowly she manages to calm down breathes deeply a few times
the schoolteacher is visibly charmed by her childish despair
eva the son of the baron isnt at all well
his parents are angry and desperate
now they say that its the tutors and my fault because we didnt pay enough attention to him
but im only there for the twins
she starts to sob again ive always taken care of them very well
when you and i were dancing the baroness had given me permission
i havent done anything wrong really
schoolteacher i know come on
eva where shall i go now
we need the money i was earning here
schoolteacher youll find something else
besides you know very well that the baron is quick tempered
with him nothing is ever as bad as it seems
eva fiercely shaking her head no no thats all over now i know it
the baroness doesnt want to see anyone
she wants to take the children with her to town or to her parents estate i dont know exactly
schoolteacher after a pause ill try to talk to her
a while back we played music together
with a smile unfortunately i wasnt very good
now shes got the tutor he plays better
as far as i know hes been studying music in town
eva forgetting her grief a bit he doesnt play that well
schoolteacher thats true
eva after a pause serious again who could have done such things
eva to beat a child that way
schoolteacher i dont know
then she says softly eva can i stay here tonight
dont send me away sir please
schoolteacher how can you think something like that
eva ill just wait for the daylight to come
here in the classroom
then ill leave
suddenly she starts to cry again they wont understand this at home
theyll think i did something wrong
then the schoolteacher do you want me to come with you
she stops crying and looks at him surprised
eva what did you say
schoolteacher cheerful tomorrow after school
i can try to find us a carriage
ill be back by evening
eva and why should you do that sir
schoolteacher stop being so formal
eva after a break why should you do this
then the schoolteacher stands up and says schoolteacher come here ill play something for you
if youd like that
she thinks for a moment then she nods eagerly
she follows him as he goes and settles in front of the harmonium
she sits on a bench nearby
he starts to the farmer and paul are cleaning the pigsty which is not very big
the pigs grunt excitedly because of the disturbance
suddenly franz enters
franz good morning father
the farmer looks up keeps on working as if nobody had come in
paul greets franz with a nod remaining silent
after a while theyve done their work
ignoring franz the farmer goes outside
franz who has stepped aside to let his father by says to him as he goes out franz im back again
they set me free
at this the farmer stops and turns around
he looks franz right into the eyes farmer i can see that
franz bows his head
paul who has followed his father out of the pigsty glances surreptitiously at his brother
the farmer goes over to the fountain and washes himself
franz follows him slowly and stops beside his father who keeps ignoring him
after a while franz says softly cant you forgive me father
the farmer stops washing and turns to franz farmer what do you want me to forgive for
that the estate wont give me any work now
that leni has been fired in disgrace
that your brothers and sisters soon wont have anything to eat
is that what you mean
or is it something else
the camera follows the carriage in which are eva and the schoolteacher
narrator the next day after school i went to the estate to inquire about sigis health and to intercede for evas reinstatement
we were told the baroness had left that morning with her children
reluctantly the steward lent me a carriage to take eva home
an open carriage with the doctor inside comes from the opposite direction
the passengers of the two carriages greet each other
the camera follows the doctor and looses eva and the schoolteacher
the doctor has one arm in a sling
the doctors carriage ends up turning into his property
the driver helps the doctor get out
xenia comes running out of the house and greets her father
the driver unloads the luggage
the doctor and xenia go into the house
just as we were leaving the village we met the doctor
a few days after the thanksgiving feast rudolph his four year old son had suddenly disappeared
of course everybody was terribly upset in view of all the previous occurrences
finally he was found walking down the road scantily dressed for a trip headed eagerly toward the town
when he was asked where he was going he said he wanted to visit his father
seems he fought tooth and nail against being taken home
somebody must have told this to the doctor
since he was scheduled to be released from medical care anyway he had prematurely put an end to his stay at the hospital
doctor calls several times rudi
he throws an ironical inquiring look at xenia
xenia shrugs her shoulders clueless xenia he was in the living room a short time ago
just as theyre about to go to the living room the driver comes in with the luggage
the doctor thanks him and pays him
the driver leaves
xenia has been waiting in the doorway
now they go together into the theres nobody
they go into the kitchen kitchen
the look under the kitchen table in the pantry
where are you
again the stairwell
the doctor doesnt know whether to be angry or to laugh about the whole matter
he goes to his wardrobe to take his off his jacket
because of the sling xenia has to help him
thats when she notices the toilet
she tells her father with a smile
as xenia hangs up the doctors jacket he goes to the toilet door and tries to open it
the doctor stops in front of it
doctor quiet hello rudi
dont you want to say hello to your father
i heard you even wanted to visit me at the hospital
and now you lock yourself in
the doctor looks shortly at xenia whos carrying the luggage upstairs
then he keeps on talking to rudolph all right
then i dont want to see you either
im going away now
you can stay in the toilet if you want
he goes down the few steps to the entrance waits a moment and then leaves the house
back to the scene
the doctor steps out of the door and wanders through the garden
he goes over to the trees where the wire had been strung
he examines the traces of the wire on the bark
he lights a cigar then looks out at the mowed fields
after a while xenia comes over to him
he glances at her then again at the fields
both remain silent
after a while xenia says everything is ready in your practice
wagner prepared everything yesterday
pause then doctor why do you tell me that
xenia looks at him surprised shrugs her shoulders
xenia i dont know
i just thought you might want to know
doctor has she taken good care of you
the doctor turns to xenia doctor how old are you now
the doctor looks at her laughs silently and shakes his head
again he looks out on the fields
after a while he says doctor its amazing how much you look like your mother
xenia remains silent
suddenly she whispers xenia dad
the doctor turns to her
she nods toward the house
the doctor follows her look
indeed rudolph who from here looks even smaller than he really is has stepped gingerly out of the door
unsure and undecided torn between defiance and longing hes kept one hand on the door handle that he can barely reach
the pastor cleans the cage of the small bird behind the desk and feeds the animal
as he does it he talks to martin who the white ribbon still tied around his upper arm stands in front of the desk
pastor your mother and i are deeply worried about you
think about it
are you sleeping badly
are you overtired
martin as if he didnt understand the question no
pastor do you have problems in school that i dont know
martin as above no father
the pastor turns shortly around to his son looks at him then turns again to the bird
pastor you probably dont understand why we worry
it comes from a sad experience i want to tell you briefly about as you know im also acting as pastor for the communities of birkenbrunn and hebern
in the latter place some years ago a mother came to see me
she had noticed that her son who was about the same age as you and had the same symptoms that youve been showing for some time
although until then the boy had been healthy and active suddenly he showed a noticeable weariness he had dark rings under the eyes seemed depressed and joyless
the boy had also changed emotionally before he had been funny frank almost naughty but now he became withdrawn
he tried not to look his parents in the eye and was caught telling small and even big lies
the pastor has finished the cleaning and feeding and now sits down behind his desk martin opposite him that lasted approximately half a year
then everything went very fast he lost his appetite couldnt sleep any more his whole face took on the brownish color of the rings under his eyes his hands began
to shake his memory stated to fail him he was covered with numerous small pustules first on his face then on his whole body and finally he died
the body which i blessed looked like the body of an old man
the pastor watches martin pastor do you understand now why im worried
martin reacts with a timid nod of his head
pastor so according to you what caused these changes that led to the miserable end of this boy
martin hardly able to speak i dont know
pastor i think you know well
martin doesnt know what to say he looks down
the pastor watches him for a long moment then he gets up walks around the desk and sits down on its edge in front of the boy so that their
heads are facing each other
wont you tell me
then ill tell you what the cause was the boy had learned from someone who had harmed the finest nerves of his body in the area where gods will has
erected sacred barriers
the boy imitated this action
he couldnt stop doing it so that at the end he destroyed all the nerves in his body and so much that he died of it
martin seems very affected
he has bowed his head swallows several times and hardly dares to breath
look at me martin
martin looks up fearfully then immediately looks away again
i just want to help you
i love you with all my heart
look at me
martin looks his father in the eyes
be sincere martin
why did you blush and become so nervous when i told you the story of the poor boy
i dont know
i felt sorry for him
pastor is that all
no martin there has to be another reason
its written on your face
be sincere martin
sincerity brings you closer to god our beloved father and to all human beings
martin starts to cry oh my god
he cries in a such pitiful way that even the pastor has tears in his eyes
he embraces the boy
the latter seizes the hand of his father and kisses it intensely
pastor well martin why are you crying
shall i spare you that confession
you too have done what that wretched boy did havent you
martin crying oh my god
intercourse between the midwife and the doctor
she holds on to the sideboard as he penetrates her from behind
both are fully dressed she has just lifted her skirt
when he is ready she turns around and puts her arms around him
he lets her do it with a patronizing smile and pulls gently away from her
doctor careful my arm
she tries to hide her frustration sits down again with him at the table on which are the leftovers of their meal
with a little ironic smile the doctor raises his glass to her
she takes her glass and clinks it with his
an embarrassed silence follows
finally she says midwife its great that youre back
it was about time
doctor you can say that
midwife it was difficult with the children without you
doctor i know
midwife he doesnt like me
doctor after a pause hes at a difficult age
midwife actually not
then theyre always at a difficult age
doctor more to himself with a faint smile yes
midwife you didnt miss me
doctor come on
what are you saying
i said it because its the truth
doctor theres nothing like a nice dose of self hate
after a pause she reaches over the table takes his hand puts her cheek against it
he lets her do it then takes his hand from under her head and strokes her hair
from the inside of the church we hear the childrens choir children singing in harmony us free from all misery that has hit us now
that old evil enemy is serious about it great power and much deceit are his cruel armor no one on earth resembles him
over this narrator winter came early that year
at the reformation feast on the first sunday of november a deep blanket of snow covered the village
the baron who had come back without his family didnt attend which was very unusual for him
immediate back to the scene
the community celebrates the reformation feast
the schoolteacher conducts the childrens choir
the children sing enthusiastically
marie and martin wear the white ribbon on their arm
the villagers took that as a sign of his anger
indeed no evidence had been found as to the possible author of the crime although the barons appeal had led to a flood of mutual suspicions even to some attempts
of denunciation that had all turned out to be untenable
the doctor examines the stewards baby that is crying
finally he turns to the parents
doctor well its not pneumonia
but you must be careful
if his temperature rises call me again
for the time being you must give these drops every two hours
and hang some wet sheets over the oven
that facilitates breathing
while the mother puts the child back in the cradle the doctor and the father go down the stairway to the living how long has the window been open
steward difficult to say
my wife nursed him at about one oclock
when she came back it was around half past two
at that time it was icy cold in this room
doctor and the baby didnt cry
the children were upstairs and didnt hear anything either
they have reached the living room where liesl georg and ferdinand get up as he comes in
doctor to the children hes doing all right considering the circumstances
we have to wait
the children seem worried
to calm them the doctor adds for now well have to wait
the steward has gone to the sideboard
steward can i offer you something to warm you up
doctor no thanks
im overloaded with work
when one has been away for so long
at a sign of the father georg jumps up and gets the doctors coat and hat from outside
in the meantime the father keeps on chatting with the doctor and how is your arm doing
doctor its all right
everything will be fine in two or three weeks
steward that must be terrible i imagine
you probably feel like half a man when you cant use your arm properly
georg has come back with the hat and the coat and hands them to the doctor doctor thank you
the steward helps him with his coat because of his bad arm
doctor laughs quod erat demonstrandum
well good night children
children good night doctor
doctor to the steward who holds the door open thank you
if your wife thinks that the baby
the steward closes the door to the stairwell so that we cant grasp the rest of their conversation
the children are alone
they remain silent
then ferdinand well
georg what do you mean well
ferdinand dumb question its obvious i mean
liesl to ferdinand when did you go down to see father
down in his office
liesl just asking
the schoolteacher a rucksack on his back walks through the snow which is only furrowed by some carriage tracks
narrator in mid december i finally got a letter from eva
her father had found her a new job in the district capital which she would start at the beginning of the new year
since that night where she had come looking for shelter in the school and we had tried to tell each other the story of our short lives until the wee
hours of the morning i could no longer banish from my thoughts her pale face her shy but frank personality and her shining hair red
the school holidays lasted until the morning after new years day but already the second day after christmas the weather was cold but sunny i went on my way to
obersdorf in order to visit eva and her parents
a lower middle class room
the schoolteacher sits in front of eva and her siblings children between and mostly red haired like eva
the younger children whisper and giggle
the conversation is slow
after a long pause eva says and sigi
schoolteacher i dont know
the baroness isnt back yet
eva and the baron
schoolteacher shrugs we hardly see him
he talks to nobody
i dont know
some say theyve gone to the south
eva to italy
the children giggle amused over the embarrassment of the two people
the schoolteacher and eva look at each other but eva soon averts her eyes
schoolteacher they now want to tear down the sawmill for good
thats what the steward says
because it isnt worthwhile to
at that moment the door opens and evas parents come in
obviously the mother went to fetch the father
she is plump in her late forties and only wears a woolen shawl over her shoulders
the father wears a hat and overcoat
hes a sturdy man in his early fifties of peasant stock
he probably came straight from a tavern and appears to be slightly drunk
the schoolteacher eva and the children stand up
the schoolteacher bows deeply schoolteacher good morning
father good morning young man
they shake hands
father please be seated
were not very formal here
with a short movement of his hand the father invites him to sit down
father to the children scram
the children rather sheepish since the arrival of their father leave the room
the father unbuttons his over coat throws the hat on the sofa and sits down
the mother has removed her shawl and asks the schoolteacher mother would you like something to drink
schoolteacher no thank you
thank you very much
the father sits down beside eva and looks at the schoolteacher
eva appears to be awkward and stares at the table in front of her
father so youre a schoolteacher
father can you afford to have a wife
short embarrassed pause
schoolteacher my father works as a tailor in grundbach
i have an apprentices diploma
so i earn quite a bit on the side father you should have taken over your fathers business that would have been smarter
and why are you so focused on that girl
shes almost still a child
you could almost be her father
schoolteacher smiles im thirty one
father grinning well you can still handle what matters
mother embarrassed father
eva and the schoolteacher dont know where to look
father lets be serious do you know whether shes willing to get married
shes still a child
she hasnt seen anything of the world
to eva say something
do you want him
eva wishes the earth would engulf her
father come on
dont make such a fuss
he walked all the way over through the fresh snow
mother why dont you leave her alone
of course she wants him
cant you feel that
father how can i
if she keeps her mouth shut
eva jumps up and runs out so as not to burst into tears out of shame
the mother follows her shaking her head disapprovingly at the father
the schoolteacher stands up as eva ran out
hed rather follow her but has to remain polite toward the father
the father says calmly father just sit down
thats how women are
a bit hysterical the whole lot of them
im not a big talker
on one hand it suits me for the girl to leave the house
we have a lot of mouths to feed as you can see
on the other hand its all moving a bit too fast for me
i dont know you
its not that i dont like you but i need to get some information about you first
besides the town hairdresser has agreed to take her on as an apprentice
that way shell get to meet people and she can make up he mind whether she really wants this or not
and if in a years time she has stuck to this idea we can l talk about it again
and you can make up your mind too all right
schoolteacher i actually thought i
father interrupts him i know i know
but its either that or nothing
you get it
schoolteacher after a short pause steps back if you insist
father yes i do
he holds out his hand to the schoolteacher who accepts it after a brief hesitation
father thats it
well business is waiting
even on holidays
ill send the girl back in so that you can say good bye
a year goes by fast
the world wont collapse
and during your holidays you can come and visit her
he leaves the room
the schoolteacher is thrown off balance by all this
he stands up and takes a few steps
he sits down again and thinks
finally the door opens and eva enters
she doesnt really know what to do
neither does the schoolteacher
as she comes in he stands up again
finally eva goes over to the table and sits down
the schoolteacher also sits down
they exchange a short glance and an equally brief smile
schoolteacher says did your father tell
schoolteacher is that all right with you
eva is that all right with you sir
schoolteacher smiles dont be so formal with me
eva looks up
their eyes meet
then she takes his hand in her hand
they remain seated without saying a word
it is dark
martin anton and florian whom we dont recognize at first glance are lying in their beds
through the window a red glow slowly getting stronger
suddenly martins voice toni
are you awake
antons voice half asleep what is it
martin voice look
antons voice whats happening
martin voice look
look whats happening out there
now anton sits up slowly rubs his eyes
antons voice my god what do you want
martin voice over there
have a look out of the window
anton turns to the window and looks at the red glow
then he slips out of the bed and goes to the window
suddenly he is wide awake anton something is burning
over there at the estate
martin untie me
anton turns around to martin hesitates
martin come on untie me
anton doesnt really know what to do
he turns to the window again then again to martin
the latter screams angrily i told you to untie me
anton i dont know
martin ill beat you black and blue if you dont untie me
the loud dispute has now also awakened florian who says in a drowsy voice florian whats happening
why cant you be quiet
martin flori come over and untie me
florian whats going on
martin yells untie me dammit
florian its burning
florian gets up himself and patters to the window
he looks out and then says amazed and enthusiastic its burning
martin imitates him angrily ok its burning
now untie me godammit
florian looks at anton with questioning eyes and then says to martin florian but father hasnt allowed it
reverse angle pov of the two boys at the window toward martin who we see for the first from the front
his wrists are tied to the left and the right side of the bed
trying sit up he pulls furiously at his ties
martin furious but if theres an emergency you idiot
somebody must warn them
he yells loudly faaaather
frightened by his screams anton now goes over to him and undoes his ties
anton stop shouting
ill untie you
florian shall i call mother
we already hear hurried steps in the corridor
the door opens and the mother enters dressed in a nightgown
mother whats going on here
martin has just been untied
martin its burning
mother i know
your father has already gone
in the door the girls appear after their mother
they have left their room attracted by the noise
the mother turns to them mother what are you doing here
to everyone you all go to bed now
theres a fire on the estate
you dont need to be afraid
go to bed and sleep
come on marie take your sisters with you and go to your room
otherwise youll catch a cold
the girls disappear again
the mother turns to martin why did you make so much noise
you woke us all up
martin doesnt know what to answer
then he says apologetically martin i thought it was dangerous
anton apologizing i had to untie his hands
mother calming them down now everythings all right again
tomorrow father will tell you what happened with the fire
now you all got back to bed
ill wait till youre back in bed
its freezing cold outside
the three boys go back to bed
but first anton ties up martins hands again
he pulls a blanket over his brother
then they all disappear under their blankets
mother good night then
martin anton florian good night mom
the mother closes the door
coming from outside we can see the glow of the fire
a big barn is blazing fiercely
sounds of the fire
against it we see as silhouettes the baron the steward and his wife the pastor and all those who are vainly trying to save thing
in the childrens bedroom lit by the reflection from the nearby flames liesl georg and ferdinand
they stand at the window and stare into the flames
paul discovers his dead father in the pigsty
the farmer has hung himself up from a hook in the wall
the knocked over stool still lies beneath his dangling feet
paul runs from the stable out to the courtyard
then he tiptoes toward the stable door
as he touches the stable door he lacks the strength to go inside again
slowly he heads for the living room
the children who are gathered pay no attention to him
leni whos cooking has looked up from her work briefly
paul sits down on the bench against the wall
it is quite dark in there
the doctor sits at his desk the midwife sits on the visitors chair opposite him
she tries to masturbate him
this time too both are fully dressed
over his clothes the doctor wears an unbuttoned white coat
he watches the woman for a while in her activity then he says coldly doctor wouldnt it be better if you stopped doing that
its like a slap in the face
she looks dumbfounded
doctor why all the effort
dont look at me so dumbfounded
its not that you lack talent
its just that i cant do it with you any more thats all
to tell you the truth you disgust me
he gets up and buttons up his pants
she feels as if the world had collapsed around her
please finish your work now
i dont want to spend all night here
the midwife remains seated her head bowed as if struck by a lightning midwife quietly what did i do to you
doctor irritated my god you havent done anything at all
youre ugly youre messy youre flabby and you have bad breath
isnt that enough
he points at the examination couch on the other side of the small room saying casually the upholstery has to be sterilized with boiling water she remains immobile and shoots
a quick mechanical glance at the examination couch
he looks at her
stop sitting there as if you were carrying all the worlds woes on your shoulders
the world wont collapse down
not on you or on me
explains i just want it to stop thats all
ive been trying but its just disgusting
i try to think of another woman when im making love to you a woman who smells good whos young one one whos less flabby than you but my imagination
cant handle it
in the end its you again and then i just feel like throwing up and am embarrassed at myself
so whats the point
midwife are you through
doctor contemptuously yes i have been for ages
he turns away
the midwife hardly moves
shes still sitting on the visitors chair
it takes her a lot of strength not to faint at the same time she speaks out calmly
midwife you must be very unhappy to be so mean
doctor oh god
please not that routine
midwife i know that im not much to look at
my bad breath comes from my stomach you know that very well
but it didnt bother you in the past when we got together
i already had my ulcer when your wife was still alive
doctor please spare me these sordid details
but let me reassure you it has always disgusted me
i accepted it because i wanted to ease my pain after erikas death and i didnt care with whom
i could have screwed a cow
whores are unfortunately too far from here and regrettably once every two months isnt enough for me even though im getting older
so skip your damn martyrdom routine and get out
midwife keeps on speaking softly why did this only occur to you now
doctor according to you when should it have occurred to me
at the hospital i had forgotten how tiresome you were
one grows sentimental when ones in pain
doctor tired get out
why dont you get out
dont you have any pride
midwife equally tired theres no room for any with you
doctor thats true
midwife arent you afraid that i might do something silly
doctor laughs with disdain go ahead
at least that would surprise me
but be careful it might be painful
midwife i know
you wouldnt care anyway
she looks at him
midwife why do you despise me
for helping to raise the boy
for watching you fingering your little daughter and not saying a word
the doctor goes over and slaps her
tears start to run down her face but after a short pause she keeps on speaking unmoved for helping you to deceive yourself
for listening to you claim how unique your love for erika was though the whole village knew how badly you treated her
for loving you although i know you cant stand being loved
the doctor snorts with disdain
doctor thats it
now leave me alone
ive got work to do
she gets up and makes room for him
he sits down at the desk and works
she looks down at him midwife you cant afford to get rid of me
who would do the dirty work for you who would help you with the children and here in you practice
youre not speaking seriously
you just want to see how far you can go dont you will she still put up with it or can i drag her even lower through the mud
the doctor works as if he hadnt heard
she keeps watching him for a while and then says softly im tired too
ive got two retarded children hans and you
youre the one that gives me most trouble
he looks up at her
after a pause he says doctor my god why dont you just die
rays of cold winter sun
the men carry the coffin out of the house
some people are already waiting outside
all wear mourning clothes
the coffin is shouldered the funeral procession forms with the pallbearers and in the lead
the others who had gathered in the house follow
paul comes out with sepp whom he tries to calm
finally leni comes out and in words that we cant hear asks the old midwife to look after the farm for a short while
she gathers her sisters and with them gets in the funeral procession right behind the coffin
the procession starts to move off
as it comes around the corner of the farm to go down the path leading to the village franz comes toward them
muttering is heard from the villagers
they dont know how to react
the procession slows down
franz comes over
for a while he stands in front of the coffin head bowed
then he joins his brothers and sisters
he and leni exchange a glance then he takes his place beside her
after he has motioned to the coffin bearers the procession starts to move off again slowly despite of the continued muttering
paul who is still carrying sepp looks expectantly toward his older brother who squeezes his hand
paul smiles shyly
then franz takes over little sepp in the most natural way
for a long moment it almost looks as if despite of all the gloom these people werent desperate
various long shots of the snow covered landscape
narrator the year was coming to an end with fine weather
the sun made the snowy landscape sparkle so brightly that it hurt the eyes
none of us suspected that it would be the last time a year moved on to the next in an era of peace and that that same year a radical
change would take place of which no one had the faintest inkling
the decorated christmas tree
outside bright sunlight
the pastor is taking the white ribbon off maries head and martins arm
the rest of the family witnesses this almost solemn act
despite of the strange events that had unsettled the village we thought of ourselves as united in the belief that the life in our community was gods will and worth
i take of this ribbon from you in the belief that from now on youll no longer need it
you marie will be accepted this year as a full member of the church community
you will receive christs body as bread and as wine
may the time of preparation for the confirmation feast be one of happiness and enrichment
and you martin from now on you shall not only be free of that ribbon but also from those nightly ties that were intended to save you from yielding to
the temptations of your young body
for in a house full of festive expectation you too on your own shall make your contribution to mental and physical purity
i trust in you my beloved children and wish you a profitable and happy new year
he strokes the childrens heads
they kiss his hand
the mother embraces them heartily
the baroness sigi and a new a forty ish nanny with the twins are get out of a carriage in front of the manor
narrator shortly after easter in the last week of april the baroness came back with the children
she was accompanied by a new nurse
thus my secret hope that eva would be able to come back here had definitely been dashed
the nurse was a chubby middle aged italian who came as everybody soon learned from the town on the mediterranean coast where the baroness had spent the winter
a maid hurries out of the house with reinforcements the baroness is being welcomed respectfully and the luggage is being unloaded
the nurse gives instructions in italian which leads to some confusion
then the nanny talks to sigi who translates to the servants laughing
besides the boy looks transformed instead of his former pale skin color his face now has a nice tan his fair hair has been further bleached by the sun he
has grown taller and looks altogether stronger and happier
the baroness too seems more relaxed and restored
she and sigi are about to go straight into the house when we hear coming from the other side of the courtyard ferdinands voice sigi
sigi turns around
ferdinand has seen him from the window and called
sigi waves back sigi hi ferdinand
im coming down
sigi wants to run over to the stewards house
baroness stay here sigi you can see him later
nurse in italian let him go signora
hes so happy to be home again
baroness muses then smiles all right you can go
but dont stay too long
sigi hurries off
the baroness and the nurse look at each other in agreement
the baroness smiles faintly
then they go through the door into the house
for a moment we only see the open door with the dark stairwell behind it
then we hear the steps of the baron first on the gravel in the yard
then baron comes into frame and goes through the door into the house
he vanishes into the darkness of the stairwell
from there we hear his voice baron calling beatrix
beatrix where are you
the nurse comes out after a while again nurse calls in italian sigi
dont you want to come say hello to your father
but sigi is talking intensely to ferdinand on the other side of the courtyard and doesnt answer
the children are going wild
brawling sponge and chalk are flying through the air
some are packing up their belongings preparing to leave the classroom
in short the way children behave once the lesson is over
marie stands at the classroom door
she watches her classmates
the she looks through the door into the its empty
she comes back to the classroom but stays at the door so that she can still keep an eye on the corridor
apparently she has been posted there as a lookout to warn against the possible arrival of a teacher
the shouting laughter and brawling goes on
suddenly marie sees the schoolteacher in the corridor with her father
the two are having an animated conversation
marie bursts into the classroom and closes the door to muffle the noise then she shouts to her classmates marie watch out hes coming
but with all the shouting and laughter her voice isnt heard by all of the pupils
the noise dies down some of them stop misbehaving
somebody picks up the sponge and the blackboard is quickly cleaned up of the traces of the fight
but a small group who had started to chase each other around doesnt hear and keeps at it
marie shouts to them again this time louder be quiet
for gods sake
but as the wild chase goes on and some over exited children even make fun of her and she yells at the top of her voice at that moment the
door opens and the pastor comes in with the schoolteacher
almost instantly the room becomes quiet
without saying a word the pastor goes over to marie grabs her by the ear and drags her through the whole classroom to the stove where he makes her stand
face to the wall
the pupils remain silent embarrassed
while the pastor goes back to the black board putting his briefcase on the desk without saying a word the schoolteacher who feels slightly responsible for the lack of discipline
of his classroom says schoolteacher whats going on here
why are you still here
you know that theres a confirmation class now
the children disappear quickly
to the first child who tries to sneak out the schoolteacher says how about saying good bye
immediately all the children rushing out say good bye sir
good bye pastor
finally all the children have left the classroom except eight candidates for confirmation among them paul xenia and marie with her face still turned to the wall
the schoolteacher turns to the pastor schoolteacher im sorry pastor
it wont happen again
the pastor answers with a reserved nod
in an icy silence he has waited for the all the younger pupils to leave
as the schoolteacher notices that there will be no further reaction from the pastor he bows slightly to him and says good bye pastor
pastor good bye
the schoolteacher leaves the room
the pastor turns to the candidates for confirmation let us pray
they say the lords prayer together
then the pastor says sit down
the students sit down
marie keeps standing facing the wall
the pastor stops too
after a while he begins to talk
this is a very sad day for me
in a few weeks we all want to celebrate the confirmation feast together
for many months i have tried to bring gods word closer to you and to make responsible human beings out of you in his spirit
and what do i face today
a horde of yelling monkeys without any discipline or human dignity as childish as the seven year olds with whom youre sharing this classroom
but what makes me even sadder is the fact that my own daughter is playing the leading role in this pitiful display
last year i bound a white ribbon in her hair
well you all know that white is the color of innocence
the ribbon was meant to help marie to avoid sin selfishness envy indecency lies and sloth
well at the start of the year i was naive enough to believe that now in the year of her confirmation shed become mature enough and that she wouldnt need
that ribbon any more i believed that she felt responsible being the daughter of the spiritual leader of a christian communi
marie who all this time has been waiting beside the stove faints and collapses to the floor
the only light comes in from the living room
rudolph comes down the stairs wearing a nightshirt
rudolph softly xeni
he goes into the living room
rudolph as above anxiously xeni
where are you
he goes into the kitchen
its also empty
rudolph is desperate
he starts to cry
finally he goes back to the stairwell and goes up the stairs to his room
on the stairway he notices light coming from under the door of the practice
he goes back down the stairs down again and opens the door of the practice
in the bright light sitting in front of each other are the doctor and xenia
the doctor has his back to rudolph so that we see xenias face first
she sits on the visitors chair
he has placed his chair in front of hers and his legs are closed around her legs
the situation is ambiguous we dont know what has happened
the noise at the door startles xenia she looks at rudolph xenia startled her face tearstained rudi
the doctor spins around and looks stunned to his young son
both look as if they have been caught red handed
xenia what are you doing here
why arent you in bed
rudolph doesnt really know what to think of all this but being the good child he is he answers automatically rudolph i cant get to sleep
xenia thats why youre wandering around like a ghost in the middle of the night
rudolph i woke up and you werent there
xenia wipes the tears from her face
xenia trying to smile dad has pierced my earlobes
rudolph does it hurt
xenia yes a bit
rudolph thats why youre crying
xenia tries to smile im not crying any more
doctor trying to joke beauty has to suffer
thats what they say
at least for girls
he gets up and goes still seen from behind to a closet and puts something into it that we cant recognize
hes straightens his clothes
then he goes over to rudolph doctor now go to bed again
you too xeni
as rudolph hesitates and looks at her dubiously she explains almost eagerly i havent worn earrings for a long time thats why my earlobes grew back again
to show him she grasps one of her ears
for whitsun feast when we all want to look our best make ourselves look beautiful im getting new earrings
the ones that mom had with garnets
rudolph looks at her
he doesnt think shes telling the truth
marie comes in
shes wearing a nightshirt her hair is damp and sticks to her head
she looks sick and feverish
she closes the door quietly then goes to her fathers desk and opens a few drawers
she ends up finding the letter opener
it has a hilt and looks like a small sword
she takes the letter opener goes to the birdcage puts the letter opener down beside it and grabs the tiny canary
as the bird chirps she glances round at the door as if to make sure that nobody is coming
narrator a few days after maries fainting fit that frightened us all and that was followed by her feverish and debilitated state
she takes the bird into her left hand so that its little head is turned upwards and picks up the letter opener with her right hand
the schoolteacher is led by the stewards wife to the living room
she carries an apron and her sleeves are rolled up
apparently she was just preparing a cake and her sticky hands make her open the door with her elbow
because of the narrators voice we dont grasp what theyre saying but we understand that shes asking him to come in and wait for the person he wants to see
and that she cant keep him company now
i went to see the steward because i wanted to borrow the carriage for the whitsun holidays again
since my marriage proposal eva had written me once a week and i got the feeling that she felt lost and alone in the city and was asking me between
the lines to come to see her again despite of her fathers interdiction
i wanted to spend whitsun saturday with her so that i could be back on sunday again and prepare the confirmation feast with the pastor
the steward had gone to the sawmill but was supposed to be back any minute
his wife who was busy preparing for whitsun asked me into the living room and to wait there for his return
the stewards wife has left the room
the schoolteacher sits around bored
after a while he gets up goes to the window and looks out
the courtyard is empty
suddenly the schoolteacher hears a female voice in the next room speaking softly
he listens then he goes to the wing door and looks through the gap on the etched glass window of the door into the next room
there liesl sits beside the cradle and talks quietly to the baby
the schoolteacher opens the door
liesl sees him gets up and greets him politely with a curtsy liesl good morning sir
schoolteacher hello liesl
smiling the schoolteacher goes to the cradle and looks into it
schoolteacher hes cute
liesl yes he is
schoolteacher do you like him
schoolteacher he was very sick last winter i was told
but the doctor cured him
with gods help
the schoolteacher looks out the window to see if the steward isnt coming
schoolteacher maybe ill pop back this evening
liesl im sure father will be back for coffee at four
she looks at the grandfather clock that indicates quarter to four
the schoolteacher thinks for a moment then he goes to the living room schoolteacher then ill go sit down again next door
liesl can i bring you something
a cup of coffee
im sure its ready
schoolteacher smiling at her eagerness no no
he stands in the door ill sit down over there again and just wait
he wants to close the door behind himself
suddenly liesl says sir
liesl can dreams come true
the schoolteacher smiles surprised at the unexpected question schoolteacher that depends why
liesl serious on what
schoolteacher smile on what does it depend
well if you dream of getting the first prize at the school feast and study hard for it then your dream can come true
liesl shakes her head quietly thats not what i meant
the schoolteacher feels that she has something on her mind and asks this time without irony schoolteacher well what did you mean then
she looks at him wondering if she should really discuss it
he nods to encourage her
liesl i mean if you dream something in your sleep i mean if you really dream it in your sleep can it come true
schoolteacher also serious why what did you dream
she bows her head
the schoolteacher thinks for a moment then he goes over to her
come on tell me
you have something on your mind havent you
she shakes her bowed head
but suddenly she starts to cry liesl crying i always dream such horrible things
schoolteacher dear tell me what youve been dreaming
she sobs he takes out a handkerchief and hands it to her take this
now calm down again
and then tell me whats going on
liesl takes the handkerchief blows her nose and wipes away her tears
she doesnt completely manage to hold her tears back and breathes haltingly
she hands the handkerchief back to the schoolteacher
the schoolteacher puts the handkerchief away with an imperceptible smile and then says reassuringly schoolteacher all right
now go on
the girl sniffles a couple of times again then swallows and says quietly liesl i dreamt that the hansi the midwifes odd little boy
schoolteacher reassuringly i know i know
that something very bad is going to happen to him
schoolteacher something very bad
liesl nods eagerly
schoolteacher like what
liesl i dont know
something like what happened to sigi not long ago
but even worse
she starts to cry again but hes so sweet
he harms no one
touched the schoolteacher puts his arm around liesls shoulder
schoolteacher all right
that was just a dream
you neednt take it so seriously
liesl crying they always make fun of him because he doesnt really
schoolteacher calmly yes i know but nobody will do him any harm you can be sure of that
liesl cant calm down
do you want my handkerchief back
she shakes her head
schoolteacher what gave you the idea that your dream would come true
she just shakes her head and keeps on crying
then he takes the handkerchief out again and hands it to her
as she doesnt take it he nudges her
she looks up confused
he holds the handkerchief again with a cheerful nod
she takes it and blows her nose
the she slowly calms down
schoolteacher now reasonable in order to calm her down dreams dont come true
let alone that kind
she shrugs her shoulders as if she disagrees with what hes saying
her head bowed she stands before him holding his handkerchief
she breathes a few more times then says with an almost adult voice liesl serious but sometimes my dreams do come true
schoolteacher what do you mean
liesl says last winter before putzl she points to the baby became ill i dreamt that my brother put him beside the open window so that hed die
and the day the window was open and he caught a chill and he almost died
the schoolteacher is completely perplexed
at first he doesnt know what to say
schoolteacher what are you saying there
thats complete nonsense
liesl bows her head again
schoolteacher somebody probably didnt close the window properly
what gave you that idea
why would your brother do such a thing
liesl defiantly as hes not believing her because hes jealous
schoolteacher and because you believe that you dreamt it
it doesnt mean anything at all
its just a coincidence
liesl keeping her head bowed all right
the schoolteacher bends over to catch her gaze
schoolteacher look at me
she looks at him reluctantly maintaining her defiant reserve
schoolteacher dont tell such stories to anybody
you obviously dont realize the harm you can do with it
again she looks down at the floor
you didnt tell the story to your parents didnt you
she shakes her head
all right then
forget it quickly
i shall forget it too
as she doesnt answer he repeats promise
she nods almost imperceptibly
now can i have my handkerchief back
he holds his hand out to her
astonished she looks at the handkerchief in her hands
she had forgotten it completely and gives it back the schoolteacher
he pockets the handkerchief
now we both have a secret
and you promise me that it will remain a secret between us
she nods reluctantly
he insists seeks her gaze yes
liesl reluctantly yes
all right then
you dont have to worry
nothing will happen to hansi
smiling nobody is jealous of him
she glances at him to see whether hes making fun of her
he looks at her seriously and gives her a nod that demands an answer
she nods briefly
but it isnt clear whether she just does it to please him
dreams dont come true
that only happens in fairy tales
forget all about it
he looks at her as she stands there head bowed
finally he smiles and tries to crack a joke to make the matter less serious do you know what they did to little girls who predicted the future in ancient
they burned them at the stake as witches
she looks up at him round eyed
the pastor comes through the door goes to his desk and is about to put down his briefcase
the dead bird lies in the middle of the desk with its wings spread out
the pastors letter opener is stuck in its neck only the hilt sticks out from its beak
the schoolteacher and eva drive in the carriage
in the background we catch glimpses of the town
narrator we had arranged to meet at the town railway station since eva wanted to avoid being seen with me
she was living with distant relatives who were apparently reporting regularly to evas parents about her life style
she had become thinner which made her even prettier and once again i was ravished by her mixture of shyness and almost childlike outspokenness
eva imitating somebody
you want your hair parted r to the right or to the left
how about one parting to the left and one to the right
both laugh heartily
all the people in the saloon were laughing their heads off
murer whos so distinguished that he never cracks a smile had to laugh
short pause in which the laughter fades down
schoolteacher then it isnt really so awful is it
but sweeping up hair all day honestly the twins were more fun i must say
but its all right
i cant really complain
the schoolteacher looks at her sideways smiling schoolteacher no
she looks at him doesnt understand that hes trying to make her complain about their forced separation and says cheerfully eva no
the schoolteacher exchanges a smiling glance with her then looks back at the road schoolteacher smiling and apart from the twins theres nothing youre missing
she looks at him surprised
suddenly she understands
she shakes her head with a smile then takes his hand for a short moment as if she were apologizing for her lack of sensitivity
eva oh you of course
he looks at her hand on his but she already has withdrawn it
both seem very happy
after a few moments during which the horse keeps trotting eva leans against the schoolteacher and puts her head against his shoulder
but the shaking of the carriage on the rutted road makes that position untenable and so they sit side by side again and drive on
finally eva says and how is the nurse
does she only speak italian
schoolteacher i dont know
thats what the steward told me
eva i see
at that moment the road crosses a brook that runs through a small wood
the schoolteacher steers the carriage on to a trail that branches off the road after the bridge
eva where are you going
schoolteacher over there into the forest beside the brook
we can picnic over there
i brought a basket of food
eva softly i dont want that
schoolteacher perplexed why
eva looks down and shakes her head
the schoolteacher stops the carriage turns to her whats going on
now he understands
he smiles although he cant really understand that shes been thinking such a thing of him
now he talks to her almost as to a child astonished and reassuringly
schoolteacher but i dont want anything forbidden from you
i just wanted you to enjoy the picnic
she looks up at him
schoolteacher astonished do you think i might want to bring disgrace on my future wife
she keeps looking at him pleadingly
finally he gives in slightly disappointed all right then
ill turn over there
he drives on
after a few meters eva puts her hand on his hands and on the reins
he stops the carriage she looks at him
he doesnt know what say
they look at each other
suddenly eva leans forward and kisses him on the lips very cautiously
they remain that way for a long while without their bodies touching each other
after separating they forget at first to keep breathing
then once the worst of the confusion has abated they both turn away from each other
the schoolteacher lets the horse start trotting again and they sit side by side on the bumping vehicle looking straight ahead quiet and overwhelmed by the happiness of the moment
the church is packed
the candidates for confirmation are kneeling at the communion bench
one after the other the pastor puts the cup to their lips
accept and drink
this is the blood of the new testament shed for the forgiveness of your sins
as he reaches marie who is kneeling fifth in line he hesitates a long moment
for so long that this causes a few irritated stares from the devout parish
even more than the other children marie is also numb with excitement
it almost looks like she might faint again
but then he holds out the cup to her too and she drinks accept and drink
that is the blood of the new will spilled for you so that your sins will be forgiven
he wipes the cup where maries mouth drank as he does after each child and goes on to the next one repeating the rite
at first incomprehensible
gradually we understand them better voices hansi
where are you
give us a sign
hansi where are you
here and there silhouettes appear in the half light
some carry lanterns other torches
it takes some time before they get nearer and become recognizable theyre men and women from the village
after a while mans voice calling over here
we follow those running over bound to a tree is a small boy
his whole head is wrapped up in rags
a small slit has been left open so the nose can breathe
a paper has been tied around his neck with a white ribbon
the people hurry toward the child free the child of its fetters
the child slumps down his head is unwrapped covered in blood its the mongoloid son of the midwife
astonished somebody reads the words written in block letters on the paper marie martin paul georg and a couple of other children are waiting at the classroom door
they remain silent
narrator after this intricate atrocity committed on the retarded boy even the baron was finally convinced that it would be more intelligent to call upon the professional help of the
countys police force
so a few days later a couple of plainclothes policemen arrived and after a visit to the several of the crime scenes started to ask in various homes if anyone
had noticed anything suspicious
the two detectives question liesl in the presence of the schoolteacher and become more and more aggressive
liesl ends up crying
narrator after learning of hansis torture i didnt think at first of what liesl had told me
when it came back to my mind i at first hesitated to tell the authorities about it
because of such an absurd coincidence i didnt want to jeopardize the reputation and inner peace of the stewards family
but when i heard that hansi might loose his eyesight because of his injuries one afternoon i made liesl come to school and tell the police officers about her dream
first police officer
thank god were not as stupid as you might think
liesl crying desperate but i only dreamt it
the officers exchange an impatient look with the schoolteacher who himself doesnt really know what to think of liesls story
he looks at her thoughtfully
the police officer turns to the girl again first police officer now listen carefully
ill give you a last chance you tell me who told you about the plan to torture the boy and we wont tell anybody who told us
liesl shakes her head desperately crying again
the police officer looks at the schoolteacher
the latter doubts whether he should speak up
he feels sorry for the girl
finally he says schoolteacher shes already dreamed of something that has come true
first police officer ironic is that so
and what was it if i may ask
schoolteacher wanting to spare her talking about it something that happened in her family
first police officer just as before i see
something to do with her family
and have you checked if it was true
schoolteacher irritated no
the police officer looks at him grunts with disdain and turns to his colleague first police officer scornfully well all that may be true
maybe were really dealing here with an authentic clairvoyant and we dont realize how lucky we are
maybe we only need to ask her whos behind all this
the we send her to bed she dreams a bit and tomorrow she tells us who did it
how about that
everythings possible isnt it
suddenly he yells at the girl stop crying
liesl jumps up with fear
the police officer stands right in front of her your deceitful whining wont work with me
ive got other ways to make you talk
i dont believe in witches and magicians let alone that a chubby little girl like you has supernatural hallucinations
therefore youd better get used to the idea of telling the truth because you wont bet rid of me until youve come clean
is that clear
all right and now were going to visit your parents to see what they think of your version of the story
he pulls the girl to her feet
shes thoroughly intimidated and sniffles faintly
then he leads her toward the door at the same time turning to the schoolteacher id be grateful if you came too
the schoolteacher finds the policemans behavior toward the child exaggeratedly aggressive but he follows reluctantly schoolteacher of course
the police officer opens the door to the and almost bumps into a group of pupils that have assembled there
first police officer oooops
what do we have here
marie kindly good afternoon
good afternoon sir
children as before good afternoon
good afternoon sir
obviously the schoolteacher didnt expect them but doesnt want to show it in front of the police
schoolteacher good afternoon
first police officer why are you eavesdropping
marie politely we saw from outside that the schoolteacher was having visitors
we didnt want to intrude
we were just waiting to talk to the schoolteacher
the police officer looks at the schoolteacher schoolteacher what do you want
marie as if she was too shy to talk in front of strangers we wanted to ask you something about hansi
again the police officer looks at the schoolteacher
schoolteacher what is it
marie hesitates a moment then screws up her courage and asks we heard he isnt well
we just wanted to ask if we could be of any help
the doctor carefully examines hansis wounds
especially the areas around eyes that are badly affected
the boy moans softly
the midwife stands beside him trying to stay calm but she is paralyzed with fear and visibly still in a state of shock
its very quiet
the doctor speaks with a soothing almost tender voice to the child who keeps on moaning doctor softly all right
everythings all right hansi
i know it hurts
youve got to be patient
everything will be fine again
he has finished his treatment and has bandaged the boys eyes again and wants get up
but hansis hand clings to his and holds him back
he hesitates a moment
the doctor and the midwife exchange a brief glance
then the doctor cautiously frees his hand from the childs
i have to go now hansi
dont worry ill be back tomorrow
the boy moans louder and tries again to grasp the hand of the doctor who he cant see
brief exchange of glances between the doctor and the midwife who ends up sitting on hansis bed taking the boys hands
midwife its all right hansi
dont be afraid
the doctor will be back
the doctor motions to the midwife that she should stay with the child and leaves the room silently and almost hastily
sitting at a brook sigi ferdinand and georg have cut willow twigs with their pocketknives and are now carving whistles out of them
their feet dangle in the water theyre concentrated on their work
georg is the first to have finished
proudly he tries it out but the little whistle doesnt sound very good
he hides his disappointment and keeps on carving to improve the sound
then sigis whistle is ready and it sounds very good
sigi is delighted
after a short and proud look over to his rivals he leans back into the grass and keeps on whistling
georg looks with irritation at the braggart and keeps on carving
then he gives it another try but the whistle doesnt sound much better than before
sigis whistling makes georgs seem ridiculous
ferdinand looks at georg with a gloating grin
suddenly georg pounces on sigi and tries to grab his whistle
sigi fights back and refuses to let go
ferdinand also gets up and watches the two grinning
even if sigi is no longer the weakling he used to be before his stay in italy georg who is three years older than him is much stronger with the
weight of his whole body he charges at sigi making him fall backward into the shallow water of the brook and takes his whistle away
the shock almost knocks out sigi and though the stream isnt deep half of his head lies under the flowing water
georg sees the danger but his pride prevents him from helping him as it means admitting his own unjust behavior
for a moment he hesitates a helpless and defiant grin on his face
but ferdinand has already jumped into the water and pulls out sigi who shakes his head to fully come to his senses
ferdinand looks up at georg who is standing on the bank still holding the whistle in his hand
then georg points his finger at him and says furiously and guiltily
georg threatening if you rat on me youll be sorry
the pastor sits at his desk working
a knock is heard
pastor come in
florian comes in hesitantly
in his hand he carries a birdcage weve already seen it in scene in the boys bedroom at night
in the cage is the bird that florian had found on thanksgiving day and who has recovered in the meantime
the boy looks embarrassed
he glances at his father then comes over with the cage and puts it carefully on his fathers desk
as florian approaches the pastor looked on amazed
after putting down the cage florian steps back a little then stops his head slightly bowed
pastor not really understanding what is it
what do you want
florian softly for pipsi
then even more softly because father is sad
the pastor looks at him doesnt know how to react
then with a hoarse voice and trying to look indifferent he says pastor thank you
florian as apprehensive in front of his fathers perceptible emotion youre welcome father
for a moment neither of them knows what to do
then the boy leaves the room
the pastor follows him with his eyes
then he sits down
he tries to keep his composure but in the end he bursts into tears
he sobs haltingly trying hard not let it be heard
georg stands at the window and looks down at the coming from the manor the steward is walking over briskly
georg leaves the window and sits down at his table doing his homework
we hear the front door opening downstairs then the fathers hasty steps on the stairs
finally the father appears in the door
hes out of breath furious and tries to speak quietly steward give me that whistle
georg looks at his father not understanding
georg i beg your pardon
steward forcedly with threatening calm give me that whistle
georg what whistle
at this the steward pounces on the boy and smacks him so hard that he falls out of his chair
give it to me
georg on the ground what whistle
the steward yanks him up and shoves him against the wall
georg stumbles over the table which is standing in the way and lies back on the table top trying to protect his face with his hands
steward give away it to me or ill kill you
georg half moaning i have no whistle
the steward lets go of him and starts to beat him furiously
georg screaming ouch
steward beat you bastard you wretch
georg scream ouch
please dont at that moment attracted by the noise emma the mother appears emma for gods sake georg what are you doing
what has the boy done
the mothers arrival has snapped the father out of his blind rage
he glances at her then turns to the boy again breathless with excitement but forcing himself to be calm steward for the last time give it to me
georg almost crying with pain but i dont know what you mean father
the mother looks uncomprehendingly from one to the other then turns pleadingly to her husband emma whats going on
what are you talking about
steward to georg you know exactly what i mean
again the mother looks from one to the other trying to save the situation emma but if he says so
whats going on
the steward turns to her annoyed by her insistence looks at her for a long moment then at georg again and turns on his heels and leaves the room
the steward runs down the stairs
the mother follows him
emma excited georg
what did the boy do
please tell me
why are you so furious
she reaches the steward as he is just about to open the front door and places herself in front of him
emma imploring reasonable georg
if you could tell me
steward also reasonable in order to get rid of her please dont interfere
leave me alone now
i have to go back to the baron
at that moment we hear from upstairs the full sound of sigis whistle s from above wild and lasting
for a moment the steward is paralyzed then he seizes the horsewhip hanging from hook in the wardrobe and dashes upstairs
we hear him thrashing the boy in the room and soon the whistling is replaced by georgs after a short hesitation the mother runs upstairs after her husband and we
now hear her trying in vain trying to control her husband
dont kill him
the meal is over
the baroness watches the maid clearing the table and putting everything away on a tray
the baron has stood up standing with his back to his wife
he pours himself a glass of brandy
with the birches over there in aigen that should make about six thousand cubic meters
working steadily they should have finished it within three weeks
if until the end of the month we
the maid has left with the tray
baroness interrupts him i wont stay here
baron doesnt understand what did you say
baroness i wont stay here
baron turns around to her what do you mean baroness what i mean is that i shall leave with the children
baron what do you mean youre leaving with the children
baroness come on armin
its not that difficult to understand is it
baron may i ask you how you plan to do that
baroness quiet i dont know yet
but in any case were leaving this place
baron sarcastic we
look of the baroness i dont need that kind of irony
the maid enters to clear the rest of the table
it leads to a longer pause
the baron drinks his brandy goes to the window waits
as the maid leaves the room she looks at the baroness inquiringly baroness to the maid i dont need you any longer
maid good night baroness
good night baron
baroness good night
even after the maid has left they remain silent for quite a long while
finally she says baroness i returned from italy only out of deceny toward you
i wanted to give us a chance
baron turns around you wanted me to give me a chance
baron well thats brilliant
and did i miss my chance
baroness quietly do you think that will help us solve the problem
baroness your sarcasm
baron actually what is the problem that has to be solved
the baroness looks at him then gets up and wants to leave the room
baron suddenly yelling you stay here
she turns around looks at him
baron softer you only leave this room if i tell you to do so
she looks at him
she goes back to her chair and sits down
baroness i wanted to spare you this but you force me to do it during our stay with uncle edoardo i fell in love with a man
hes from lombardy he works in the banking business and helped uncle edoardo in a financial matter
he courted me and was also very fond of the children
if sigi has blossomed and grown so healthy its largely thanks to him
despite all this we came back
because i feel committed to you
but i cant stand this place any longer
not so much for me personally though i cant say that life with you is exactly thrilling for a woman of my age
but if i leave this place its because i dont want sigi and later the twins to grow up in surroundings dominated by malice envy apathy and brutality
what happened with sigis whistle was the last straw
im sick and tired of persecutions threats and perverse acts of revenge
baron did you sleep with him
baroness laughing scornfully you dont understand anything
baron did you sleep with him
baroness quietly no
i didnt sleep with him
baron youre lying arent you
the baroness looks at him
then she gets up about to leave the room again
at the same moment somebody knocks at the door
after a short gesture of irritation baron irked come in
the steward appears
steward good evening
could i talk to you for a moment baron
baron annoyed cant it wait until tomorrow
steward its really urgent
normally i wouldnt have disturbed you so late
annoyed the baron leaves the room with him
as he goes out the steward greets the baroness with a nod
once the door is closed she stops for a moment goes to the window and looks out pensive
she ends up going to the small bar and pours herself a glass of brandy
her hands are shaking a little
she drinks from the glass goes back to the window and looks out waiting taking a sip from now and then
below in the a few people walk around nervously
but it doesnt look particularly unusual
a saddled horse is led into the stable
finally the door of the opens again
the baron comes back inside
he looks distressed
the baroness doesnt know whether this is the result of her conversation or of the message brought by the steward
the baron paces a few steps pondering then glances at his wife
finally she asks baroness whats going on
baron theyve shot the heir to the throne of austria
the same setting as in scene
the countryside in all its summer splendor
narrator the news spread around the village like wildfire
what would the consequences be
the first person who spoke the word war was severely contradicted
but once it had been uttered it remained at the center of all our thoughts in a curiously stubborn way
i wanted to go to the town as quickly as possible in order to discuss it with eva what we should do if war broke out
perhaps her father would now agree to an earlier marriage
i asked the baroness for the bicycle with which eva had visited her parents some time ago
the following weekend i planned use it to ride to town and see her
the schoolteacher is pushing the bicycle out of the manor house
he says good bye to a maid who closes the door behind him
some shouting o
makes him look toward the stewards house the steward comes out with the midwife and it looks like hes throwing her out with a flood of angry insults
narrator when i went to the estate on friday evening to pick up the bicycle so i could take it with me to the school and get going early as
the trip was a quite long one i witnessed a strange confrontation steward
go if you want
hell throw you out on your ear
slandering other people and creating trouble
thats all we need now
get out and never come back again
this is unbelievable
go ahead do whatever you think you have to do
ill go to the baron
well see what he says
you wont silence me
who do you think you are
ill tell him that you tried to prevent me from giving the police a statement
angrily the steward slams the door behind him
at first the midwife doesnt know what to do
finally she turns away from the door and starts to cross the yard
there she sees the schoolteacher
she comes over to him
schoolteacher good afternoon mrs
midwife very excited good afternoon
can i borrow your bicycle
schoolteacher its not mine
midwife could i borrow it just the same
schoolteacher i just borrowed it myself
i going to ride to town to see my fiancee
lend it to me
schoolteacher why do you need it
where do you want to go
midwife i must go to town
schoolteacher what for
midwife i asked the steward for a carriage but that stubborn fool wont agree to anything
lend me the bicycle
what is going on
after hesitating a while midwife i have to go to the police in town
i now know who committed all these crimes
schoolteacher flabbergasted who
midwife will you let me have the bicycle
schoolteacher why dont you tell me
midwife from now on i shall only talk to the police
i wont let them insult me turning to the stewards house as you just saw
schoolteacher cant the doctor can lend you his horse
midwife i dont know how to ride
the schoolteacher looks at her inquisitively because he still doesnt understand what its all about but she doesnt respond and says midwife please
she hesitates and adds now quietly and imploringly my son told me who did it to him
he may loose his eyesight
please you let me have the bicycle
the schoolteacher looks at her
the midwife looks pitiful she tries to smile at him pleadingly tears are streaming down her face
finally he gives the bicycle to her
she grabs it quickly says thanks
and rides away
the schoolteacher remains behind alone
he stands pensive then he goes slowly back to the village
narrator the state that woman was in who i knew was level headed had deeply impressed me
what had her son told her that she didnt dare tell anybody
the schoolteacher goes home
narrator with each step i took from the estate back to the school i felt more foolish for having given away the bicycle
as he passes the midwifes house he sees behind the fence in the garden half hidden behind the bushes marie and a few other children
the shutters of the house are closed
as i passed the midwifes house i saw marie martin and a few other children in the garden
the schoolteacher stops watches the children
after a few moments they notice that somebody is watching them
marie good evening sir
schoolteacher good evening marie
children good evening sir
schoolteacher what are you doing here
marie we wanted to see how hansi was doing
schoolteacher but cant you see that the shutters are closed
we were worried
we saw mrs
wagner riding off on a bicycle
so we wondered what had happened to hansi
schoolteacher go home now
nobody said you could come in here
the children go out slowly
they open the wooden gate in the fence and go out into the street
theyre visibly embarrassed at being caught by the schoolteacher when they were doing something wrong
some avoid the schoolteachers eyes while others mutter a greeting as if they wanted to say goodbye as they went away
the schoolteacher looks annoyed
as marie steps out of the garden door he says schoolteacher you better go back home now hurry
marie doesnt seem to feel guilty at all
again she greets him politely
marie good evening teacher
schoolteacher reluctantly good evening
the children go away
the schoolteacher also goes on his way
after a few steps he turns around and looks at the children then walks on
narrator then i thought of liesls dream again
what if liesl hadnt dreamt but had known that hansi was going to be tortured
whose crimes did she know of
whose name had she refused to reveal
the strong interest of the children in hansi seemed strange to me considering that they had usually refused to have any contact with him because of his disability or only
dealt with him in a rather disdainful manner
the schoolteacher stops
he ponders about this
then he goes back to the midwifes house
suddenly i wondered why the midwife had closed the shutters of the house
nobody in the village ever shut their house
why had the midwife locked her boy in
he has reached the front of the house again
indeed with its closed shutters it looks uninhabited
only because of the tidy little front garden could one tell that somebody lived there
the schoolteacher opens the garden gate and goes up to the house
he tries to open the door and then the shutters
everything is well shut
he peers through the cracks in the wooden shutters
can you hear me
nobody seems to answer
for a short moment the schoolteacher disappears behind the house apparently looking for another way to get inside
but he soon comes back without having found anything
narrator if the midwife couldnt take care of him she would have entrusted the boy to me or to the doctor
but since the night he was mistreated i hadnt seen him again
he leaves the midwifes house and hurries to the neighboring house the doctors
i decided to ask the doctor directly
he enters the property goes up to the entrance and rings
he rings again then he sees a note tacked up the doctors practice is closed until further notice the pastors wife and the schoolteacher stand before the closed front door
pastors wife his daughter
wasnt she with you at your school
schoolteacher yes she was
pastors wife and she didnt say anything
the schoolteacher shakes his head
they both remain silent and pensive
schoolteacher i have a request
pastors wife yes
schoolteacher could i ask marie and martin
pastors wife dont you want to wait for my husband
hes at the church
the service will be over in a quarter of an hour
but if you insist
please come in
she opens the door and points to a chair
please be seated
ill fetch the kids for you
she leaves the room
the schoolteacher remains standing
finally the pastors wife comes back with the two children
marie and martin good evening sir
schoolteacher good evening
the pastors wife dont you want to sit down
schoolteacher who hasnt thought of it yes
they sit down
the children sit opposite the schoolteacher
pastors wife can i offer you something
smiling faintly a cup of coffee
like during the piano lessons first the schoolteacher wants to refuse then he decides to accept so as to get rid of the woman and be alone with the children
schoolteacher yes with pleasure
thats very kind of you
pastors wife ill be back in a minute
the schoolteacher turns to the children schoolteacher did you know that the doctor was leaving eichwald
schoolteacher but you dont seem surprised at my question
marie our mother told us when she came to fetch us
schoolteacher and xenia didnt tell you anything about it
she looks at martin who confirms it martin no
schoolteacher incredulously not a word
its very unusual for a child not to tell his classmates before going away on a trip
marie unimpressed xenia never talks much about home
schoolteacher well thats something completely different
apparently marie doesnt take it as a further question and remains silent
schoolteacher i get the feeling youre hiding something from me
schoolteacher thats what id really like to know
then the schoolteacher turns to martin schoolteacher when you were looking for hansi a while ago what did you want from him
marie we were worried
schoolteacher im asking martin
he isnt well
and since his mother is gone
we thought we should go and pay him a visit
the schoolteacher realizes that he wont get any further this way
schoolteacher did you ever ask yourselves who could have treated hansi that way
then the schoolteacher adds and sigi
and who tied the wire in the doctors garden
and who set fire to the barn
marie yes of course we wondered
marie we discussed it with father
he said it must be a sick person
the schoolteacher doesnt know how to go on
schoolteacher sigi was with you at thanksgiving
and so was hansi
marie i dont understand
with demonstrative helplessness she looks at the schoolteacher then at her brother and again at the schoolteacher shaking her head and shrugging her shoulders
schoolteacher what did they do to you
marie doesnt seem to understand who
schoolteacher sigi and hansi
marie as above why
schoolteacher they obviously were being punished
marie as above i dont know
schoolteacher liesl foresaw that hansi would be punished
marie as above i dont know
why do you ask us
schoolteacher youre an intelligent girl marie
dont try and play dumb
marie i dont understand you sir
you should talk with father about this or with mother
shall i go get her
the schoolteacher looks at her
marie martin would you please get her
martin gets up and is about to go to the door
schoolteacher stay here martin ill talk to your parents when i consider its the right time
now im talking to you
and i expect you tell me the truth
martin sits down after exchanging a glance with marie again
where were you on the evening hansi was found
marie doesnt seem to understand at home
schoolteacher i mean after the confirmation
at that moment the pastors wife enters with the coffee cups on a tray
pastors wife there we are
the coffee will be ready in a minute
she puts the tray on the table
turns to the schoolteacher friendly as ever were the children able to help you
the schoolteacher looks at marie then he answers schoolteacher im afraid not
they dont know anything either
pastors wife thats really odd
a doctor cant vanish into thin air
what about his patients
to the children didnt his daughter tell you anything at school
the schoolteacher gets up ready to leave
im sorry if i disturbed you
pastors wife why dont you stay
my husband will be back any moment and the coffee is almost ready
schoolteacher thats very kind of you but im really worried about the midwifes son
pastors wife and she didnt say when shed be back
schoolteacher i didnt ask her
she caught me off guard
she was completely panicked
the pastors wife shakes her head thoughtfully
pastors wife strange
wait a second
i think thats my husband
and indeed outside one can hear the front door and then the steps of the pastor
the wife goes to the door to open it
the pastor appears
pastor surprised to see the schoolteacher good evening
pastors wife good evening
the schoolteacher has been anxiously waiting for you
pastor to the schoolteacher yes
id like to have a quick chat with you
the pastor doesnt really understand what can be so urgent and why the schoolteacher which was unusual for him came to see him in the evening
but he remains friendly pastor please
wed better go to my study
its quieter there
the schoolteacher nods to the pastors wife who is glad that the required meeting can now take place while the pastor walks ahead with an inviting gesture
as the pastor opens the door of the study he asks pastor well how can i help you
they enter the room and the pastor offers the schoolteacher a chair
then he realizes that the windows are open and closes them as the schoolteacher starts to speak
schoolteacher i spoke to the midwife today she said she now knew who tortured her son
schoolteacher shell only tell the police
thats why she went to town
pastor doesnt quite understand what the schoolteacher is getting at well
schoolteacher she left the boy behind alone and has locked the whole house
pastor locked it
schoolteacher nods i went to the doctors next door to ask him what was going on whether he was taking care of the child or
but theres a piece of paper saying that the practice is closed until further notice
the doctor and his children have disappeared
the pastor has almost finished closing the windows
he pauses and turns to the schoolteacher pastor stunned what do you mean
schoolteacher shrugs i dont know
i thought you might have been informed
thats why im here
after a startled pause the pastor shakes his head pastor i have no idea
he finishes closing the windows
then he goes thoughtfully over to the schoolteacher and sits down in front of him
wasnt his daughter in school
schoolteacher yes she was
she never mentioned anything
the pastor ponders
then after a while schoolteacher i asked marie and martin
they both know nothing either
pastor looks up to the schoolteacher stunned why should they
the schoolteacher almost dodges speaking further schoolteacher i dont know
when i went to the midwifes place they were there with a few others in the garden
pastor doesnt understand to do what
schoolteacher they were looking for the boy
pastor as before why
schoolteacher they wanted to help him
pastor so what schoolteacher hesitates then says i dont know how to say it
i have the feeling theyre hiding something
pastor refuses what
schoolteacher keeps on searching hesitantly for his words i dont know
finally he dares to come out with his suspicion when the doctor had his accident
last year you remember suddenly the children were in his garden
supposedly in order to help xenia
pastor doesnt understand yes
the schoolteacher uneasy breathes hard
he knows that his suspicions will seem odd and senses that the pastor wont go along with then
i had forgotten it
today it came back to my mind again
pastor as before i dont understand
schoolteacher when they found the barons son
the last time he had been seen he was with the children
the pastor looks at the schoolteacher then his face slowly freezes to a mask of refusal pastor what are you getting at
of course the schoolteacher notices the reaction
but he has already gone too far to backtrack
after a pause he goes on schoolteacher a couple of days before hansi was almost beaten to death the stewards daughter had predicted precisely that to me
supposedly she had dreamed it
the police thinks shes lying
who told her about it
who announced it to her
finally the pastor gets up takes a few steps then after another pause turns again to the schoolteacher
his face is ashen and he can hardly speak pastor if i understand you correctly youre saying that your pupils my children included committed these crimes
is that right
the schoolteacher has little affirmative and regretful gesture
he feels extremely uncomfortable in this role
then the pastor continues do you realize what youre saying
he breathes heavily tries to control his emotions
do you know
his voice fails
his chin starts to shake tears flood his eyes and he suddenly turns away
the schoolteacher who has been looking at him now looks down and stays where he is without saying a word
after a while the pastor has regained enough control of himself to turn back to the schoolteacher i assume that im the first person to whom youve uttered this monstrosity
mute reaction of the schoolteacher of course
if you ever dare to bother other people with it if you publicly denounce respectable families and their children in this abject way i shall make sure and you can
take my word for it that you will go to prison
the schoolteacher wants to reply something but the pastor continues ive seen quite a lot during my work as a pastor but ive never come across anything as repulsive as
he looks at the schoolteacher for a moment with disdain one can tell that you have no children
otherwise you wouldnt stoop to such viciousness
you have a sick mind
i wonder how the school authorities could let you loose among those poor creatures
ill have a word with the authorities at the proper time
and now please leave my house
i never want to see you here again
the steward his wife and the schoolteacher try to break into the house
first the steward tries several keys
as this doesnt work they break down a door at the rear of the house and go in
narrator the midwife never came back
i waited until the morning two days later
then i went to the manor house to inform the baron
he referred me to the steward and said to open the house immediately and to look after the disabled boy
the schoolteacher the steward and his wife search through the house
because of the closed shutters its rooms are veiled in half light
several times they call hansi
hello hansi where are you
which can faintly be heard under the narrators voice
in the midwifes bedroom the schoolteacher notices a photo it shows the doctor an unknown woman and xenia as a small girl
the boy is nowhere to be found
narrator i had never come to the midwifes house and felt uncomfortable at the idea of barging into somebody elses house without asking
it was strange but we were still seeking and calling out anxiously hansis name and i already knew that we were searching in vain
anyone who knew the midwife also knew how devoted she was to her disabled child and that she would never have left her wounded hansi all alone
the three searchers who have found nothing meet again in the stairwell
the schoolteacher the steward and his wife come out from behind the house leave the property and go their separate ways on the street
all that is left is the empty house with its closed shutters
narrator during the next few weeks the village gossip factory worked overtime
some claimed the doctor was hansis father
he and the midwife had tried to abort the child so that the shame of their relationship wouldnt be found out and thats how the child became disabled
others even went as far as to claim that there was something fishy about the death of the doctors wife and that they wouldnt be surprised if the two werent
responsible for it
the houses of the doctor the pastor the farmer the street before the school the estates administrative buildings and the manor house
there is nobody to be seen
narrator whoever had lynched the boy obviously knew about the hidden crimes of his parents
suddenly it seemed even possible that the doctor and the midwife as potential murderers were also the perpetrators of all the other crimes
it was suspected that the doctor had wanted to spare his legitimate children and himself public disclosure of his guilt and had therefore fled with them
apparently he had taken the disabled boy with him out of guilt
understandably enough he had left behind his accomplice and the mother of the disgraced child
the fact that it was on a bicycle that she tried to catch up with the man who had happily escaped was the cause of a great deal of laughter
the deserted estate is decorated with flags
on july th austria declared war on serbia
it was followed on saturday august rst by the german declaration of war on russia and on france the following monday
the villagers are about to take their seats
the smaller children are sitting with their parents on the pews
all are in their sunday best the members of the militia are in uniform
flags are planted
joyful excitement reigns everywhere
once the church is full the baron the baroness and their son sigi walk down the aisle and sit down in the front row
narrator on the sunday between those dates the whole village came to the festive service
an atmosphere of expectation and departure was in the air
from now on nothing would be the same
only a few days ago everybody would have called the life they lived as gods will worthy of being lived and would have shunned any change
the strange joy with which the coming war was greeted showed that this certainty of order and security was based on very shaky foundations
of all the adult leading characters of the film aside from the doctor and the midwife
also of eva and her father
in the frenzy of patriotic enthusiasm that was flaring up the events that had shaken eichwald had become an irrelevant
in the face of the coming war evas father had taken his daughter back and at her pleading had come to eichwald to cast an eye at the place where
his future son in law was living and working
the prospect that i might soon call this beloved creature my wife turned this day also into a solemn day for me
the pastor never mentioned our conversation again
our relationship was limited to what was required professionally
he apparently never went through with his threat to denounce me to the school authorities
the schoolteacher on the gallery lifts his hands and cues them to begin
they start singing
we see them one after the other
at the end we see marie she wears the white ribbon in her hair
today more than a quarter of a century later toward the end of my life and several years after the end of a second war that was to change this
world in a more cruel and radical way than the first one the one we faced at the time i wonder if the events of those days and our silence about them werent the germ of the tragedy toward which we were heading
didnt we all know secretly what had happened in our midst
hadnt we in a way made it possible by closing our eyes
didnt we keep our mouths shut because otherwise we would have had to wonder if the misdeeds of these children of our children werent actually the result of what wed
been teaching them
the image of marie singing with the shining white ribbon freezes
i was drafted at the start of the third year of the war
after the war i sold the house in grundbach that i had inherited from my father who had died in the meantime and with the money i opened a tailors
shop in the town where i still live now
i never saw anybody from the village again
over the freeze frame the end credits begin
once the narrators voice has gone silent we listen to bachs solemn chorale
the children sing beautifully
