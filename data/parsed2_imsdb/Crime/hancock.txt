written by vincent ngo vince gilligan black
it swallows the screen
and so we stare into a sea of black
i saw a severed head once
except for the paleness it looked healthy well fed
the end came abruptly you could tell cause the mouth froze in mid sentence
the curled lips attempted
like it started saying shucks or shirley or
your eyes dont forget things like that
like you dont forget the sound animals make when theyre humping
they endure in you forever because the senses have a brain all their own and they recall long after youve succumbed to the la la of forgetfulness
a pregnant beat sometimes when its dark out so dark its black ill see him
and it starts all over again
from this blackness a streak of lightning splits the night sky
we are in the eye of a storm an angry mass of clo uds raging o f a howling wind
across the black sky
it brings rain and thunder an d the swirl an entity emerges from this moist darkness
weather and advances into our scope of visibilityies through the a flash of lightning erupts and it illuminates the sky
we see the approaching entity as it hovers before us
its a man
its a man plus
its a superhero garbed in an elastic dark grey outfit a faded red cape extends b ehind him thrashing against the wind and rain
a face chiselled with mileage
in the eyes we can see his soul
an exposed nerve snagged in a fish hook
he hangs in the air tired rain soaked pissed off
he stares down at the earth below and he beholds the saturated visage of sheepshead bay a seaside brooklyn neighborhood
and from the bowels of his very soul this superhero belches a thunderous roar
he pivots in the air and dives toward land
he slices through the downpour arms extended body erect engulfed in the dimensions of his cape
the ground approaches fast
he accelerates as if to embrace it
velocity sucks up all remaining space and there is impact
an explosion as he rips through the street surface penetrating the asphalt head first
debris and concrete spew from the ruptured orifice as he disappears inside
there is an expulsion of subterranean pressure and it launches nearby manhole lids from their spots they bounce and clang down the street like loose change
the rain continues its onslaught
rain sloshes against a kitchen window
where the sink is
not far from the kitchen table
where the longfellow family sits dinner before them
horus leans over his plate eating his meal
here idles a man of diminutive frame bespectacled placid as harmless as low fat milk
he sits opposite mary frenetically appropriating food
a gentle beauty
entwined in maternal angst she is estrogen with an attitude
a meek little aaron slouches between the folks a black eye tattoos the left of his face
aaron stares at the damn plate finding no humor in eggplant
the principal didnothing
like schoolyard terrorism is no worse than being tardy
whats the matter with education
back when you could go to school and learn about betsy ross and
not get stabbed on the way home
a subway tram idles by a passenger ramp
steam hisses from its side and plumes into a wall of white mist
and from this cloud of angry vapors a figure appears
he surfaces from the dark subway tunnel a cool nonchalance in his gait
it is the superhero his identity safely concealed under the collar of a tattered trenchcoat
he traverses the loading deck passengers boarding and disembarking around him
he wades through them to a deserted section of the subway
he strolls over to a cigarette machine up against the grafetti raped subway wall
on the wall a line of profanity declares that
he surveys the machine
his right arm appears from the coat pocket
fingers merge into a tight fist
and casually he rips into the metal vendor like it was jello
his fist withdraws a handful of bills coins
he pockets the loot
he reaches back in and withdraws a carton of lucky strike
deposits it under his coat
and with that he heads for the stairs to the flooded streets above
at the ramp and on cue the subway tram closes its doors
steams into the deep dark tunnel
white smoke mushrooms from its tail
it lingers in the air as we
see steam rising from a faucet of running hot water
it rises from a sink of soiled dishes where mary deposits another set of pots
shes clearing the table
down a dark hallway a streak of light escapes from an open door
inside and on the bed the frail posture of horus changes out of his clothes
horus disrobes down to his t shirt and briefs
he stands before the closet mirror scrutinizing the emaciated sand kicked in the face body
horns strikes a he man pose his biceps in the wind
he removes the police apparel plastic
proceeds to put it on
how the fuck can i help you sir
his blood shot eyes mean it
fish turns to the back wall
grabs a random key from a nail
top floor f
fifteen a pop up front
re the check in sheet and your john hancock makes it sweet
the superhero scrutinizes the check in sheet
scribbles on the dotted line
fish hands over the key
then pulls it back from hancocks grab
i dont take messages i dont do favors and i dont know you from jack
you want sheets theyre extra
i need quiet
is it quiet
hey pal we look like a public library to you
the girls work
some of them scream some of them moan
and some of them just kinda lay there cold
you want quiet i got cotton balls you can stick in your ear
hancock eyes fish mentally dissecting the vermin with his bare hands
he withdraws from his coat the wad of loot
pushes it under the window
and while fish collects he leans into the window and emits a deep growl
the bills fly
hancock takes the key
exchanges it with a metal orb the strangulated remains of the bell
it rolls out of his palm and clinks off the counter
hancock sidles off
fish the cats got his tongue
horus in full uniform dark blue pants shirt
he dips into a dresser pulls out a thick black leather belt complete with holster
horus returns to the dresser for one final item its obscured by his arm but we feel it to be some heavy chunk of metal
he confronts the mirror twirls this piece holsters it
and we see it to be a flashlight
a shoulder patch reads
their motto to observe and record horus tucks a hat under his arms ready to move
a jar of marbles rests upon a window ledge
outside the story is rain
on a bed sprawled on his back aaron gazes up at the empty ceiling the black eye squats prominently on his face
aaron brings his hand before his eyes
looks at it
slowly his fingers converge into a tight fist a boys interpretation of a mans weapon
a gentle knock disperses the knuckles
horus peers in
hows the eye
stands awkwardly before his son
itll be gone in a week
mom touch it up with some make up and you wont even know its there
yeah i will
and i dont want any girly make up on my face
horus deposits himself on the bed
hunches over h knees
almost apologetically therell always be people around wholl
exert force over those of us who just want to live in peace
aaron listens observing his fathers efforts
pain in every word the thing to do is
to avoid them
theyre no wins
you hold the anger
and move on
you hold the anger
turns to aaron i tell you because i cant take it seeing you hurt
youre part of me
ive felt what youre feeling now
and if youve got any of me in you youre gonna feel what i felt when you go up against one of em
thats what you do
the other cheek
you do that for me
no youre not the coward
ill be the coward all right
cause i dont want to see you hurt
i love you
i ask you to do that for me
your old man
and while he utters these words mary watches from the dark hallway moved b y his affection
she oversees a father son embrace
im late for work
get some sleep
tomorrow always feels better
after a good night sleep
the light flicks off and the mans silhouette form exits the room
horus backs his way out
shuts the door
marys hand greets him from behind
it startles the man
tries to regroup
mary inches closer passion oozes from every pore
she nestles up against her husband
horus stands uncoordinated pressing his hands against her back
he is gentle but as effective as an armless masturbator
mary caresses his neck
moves her lips to his ear enraptured the moment
and out of nowhere
mary snaps from her trance
unshackles her hold like she almost expected it
coffees by the door
she marches back into the kitchen
horus stares at his feet
s hakes his fists mentally kicking himself in the face
he settles for the door grabs hisjac ke coffee thermos
a look at mary and hes out thedoo rt mary against the kitchen sink
her thin cotton dress clings to a body stillrobust with enrgy to breasts so ful l they could yread uncl pop a boner inoud e and while the storm rages
outside mary burns in a feverish sweat
the swelling steam and running ho t water combine to saturate her chest and face she drips
mary gazes out at the wet abyss possessed by some inner longing
it moans from the corner of a room
scant blinking red neon from the street cannot disguise thecant lighting torture this r oom has seen
torn mildewed curtains
et d by every form of bodily discharge
no self rem ni g maggot would want to be caught dead here
on a shredded s blotched with urine and cum we see a trenehc li n open carton of cigarettes accompanies the picture
an open door faces the moaning tv set
its the bathroom and its occupied by the intensely frazzled image of hancock
he squats on the toilet pants around the ankles cape shrouded around him
those unforgiving eyes plant on the tv screen a cigarette dangling from the corner of his lip
we discern the moans to be human and we see that he is watching a porno flick flashes of flesh upon flesh in a fucking frenzy
ooh yeah big fella
shoot your load baby
let it fly
male in ecstasy fly
hancock absorbs the action from the can a glint of pain on his face
he takes a long hard drag on the cigarette a full stick deteriorates into ashes before our eyes
and outside it rains like theres no tomorrow
morning brings a cease fire on precipitation
the streets glimmer from puddles left behind from the night
the overcast sky its precarious rain formation indicates that the storm is far from over
a superman lunchbox perches on the kitchen table
mother and son prepare for school
aaron adjusts his raincoat looking disturbed
mary parts his hair straightens his shirt
the complete morning routine
her maternal hahdf stay inside
i dont need you walking me to school
mary clasps her ears deaf
not listening lalalala
in disbelief i got the only mother does this
in the world that im not lismary g
a light beam
it dances over the consoles of h h orns holsters i fis televisions his flashli ht stereo floor
he take and mores across the s s the stairs g down
howrooms horus passes the second floor
horus crosses the floor to the back
to where stoops on a stool and in a deep from his mou th over his saturated ssleeve
a line of saliva dangles the badge and uniform reveal employee
roheim another u rent secu co
is your uncle lostjck sexuallytdeviant as threatening as a burnt outmat and horns stands over roheims slumpne ss
removes a from his own pocket
hes done this before
dream state olga
lets go home
from the dark recesses of sleep he wakes
slurps back his dignity
takes the handkerchief
wipes his mouth
i just made the last run
he helps the old man to his feet
youre a good man
an ashtray buried under a mountain of butts
a bed unslept
the tv is on commercialing some spring fresh vaginal wash
the room sits empty
but the bathroom door is open
inside the supersuit peeled down to his waist hancock shaves
mumbling rehearsing its about responsibility
with what is empowered in you
to correct the ills of man
just skin and the razor edge of his belt buckle it slices through stubble clearing up a face that has yet to sleep
its about responsibility
hancock reaches into the cabinet below the sink pulls out a bottle of all purpose cleaner
on the tube the commercial segues way into
and on the world front heavy fighting continues in angola as rebel forces storm
under the military stronghold
the sound of machine guns crackle amidst mortar explosions and civil destruction
hancock listens it disturbs him
he whirls around accosts the tv rips it from the wall throws it out the window
and a crash eradicates images of war and chaos
he returns to the bathroom
to the mirror
proceeds to spray his teeth with
behold this imposing block long behemoth of commerce and decadence
a shoppers wet dream this is watanabes shopping from the street notice the display windows all mannequins come complete with outfit and ultra erect nipples
as employees file into the service entrance out comes horus and roheim
they head streetward to the sidewalk
roheim unscrews the battery cap from his flashlight
takes a swig from its hollow interior
ill just play out the rest of this eight ball
he laps up the last drop
reloads it with a couple of batteries from his jacket
caps it like that
horus looks on silent
a police vehicle enters this urban landscape
it slows in front of them
the cops rutger and adams two hairy knuckled testosterone cases with nothing to do
passenger seat boys
the cops smile at one another
a large shotgun rests fully erect between them
and they drive off
horus watching them go focuses in on the of their vehicle
roheim watches him turning red with drama
couldnt protect a pitcher of warm spit
couldnt find their asshole with common sense and a thumb
like i been saying its their
the jerk offs they dont got the heart
the sensitivity of a man like you
horus tries to shrug off these words
no good they stick like a thorn in the eye of his soul
come on lets go home
on the rooftop the red eye motel
a trenchcoated figure we see him from the back only
we recognize the broad of his shoulders and the red of his cape peering out from a hole in his coat
a cloud of smoke lingers above his head from an unseen cigarette
he stands before the sheepshead neighborhood ever so still
something brews within this superman
the streets of sheepshead apartments brownstones speckled with e delis and newsstands and barber shops and outdoor markets they are the esque in bro ly qu through this hustle bustle
we spot mary and aaron on their way schoolyard activities abound
buses bouncing balls and hoards of screaming little anti christs
mary leads aaron along the playground fence the latter trying to pull ahead and away
will you slow down
i know it
i know it
i think im
im gaining weight
honey take a look at my waist
is my dress too tight
really my waist isnt too big
not here mom

ill be there
i know it mom
can i go now
give me a kiss you snot
there is no god geez
he turns back
plants a kiss on marys smiling cheeks
all right mom
he leaves merging into the undulating sea of children
after him in vain you want anything from the store
this is the longfellows street lower middle class but comfortable quaint safe
longfellow hustling through the street takes us home
greeting him at the entrance at the mailboxes is clyde banner
quite large this tenant is quite simply a cro magnon man
clyde stands with the morning paper in hand searching carelessly through
he finds the sports page
hides it under his robe
good to see you
clyde shoves the remains of the paper at horus in his face
picked this up for you
pulls the paper back say thanks
hands it over youre a good man
he heads inside
horus swallowing it
he unshuffles the paper finding the front page
the headline reads
horus checks the sky a sinewy mesh of angry clouds
he lumbers inside
your average market mom and pop
mary handles an artichoke contemplating
nick the grocer moves behind her
handsome in a greasy grimy rebuilt carb in uretor hes thats a lovely dress mary
if he could mount her now he would
youre sweet nick
he cracks a wet smile
mary aware unhands the artichoke
mary moves through the street embracing a grocery bag
she continues her way purpose in every step
no window shopping bullshit for this woman marys strong beautiful
she crosses the street her destination central fidelity bank
a dark chevy eases pass mary on this street pulls to a stop
mary continues forth entering the bank
sheepshead denizens crisscross amok
people queue behind teller lines taking care of business
mary takes her place
she glances at the bank clock its oclock
a bee spirals the air and lands on the sleeve of a nervous arm
this arm protrudes from the dark chevy parked before the bank
the engine is running
the arm fidgets
shoos the insect away
with white knuckles it grips the wheel
same bank same people
mary awaits service in the same line
a man ambles pass marys line up towards the front
he cuts off the person in front an elderly woman
hey whats the idea
the man turns
his smile fades turning into a maniacal
this man is tom as plainly evil as the eye can see
you know what you remind me of my grandma
tom whips out a sawed off shotgun from his pants
she gave me this when i made parole
he aims the barrel in her face
of course by now people have realized the implications of the situation at hand
they begin to panic
on cue two new gunmen jerry and jerry s emerge from the crowded bank both revealing automatic rifles
jerry drops the security guard with the butt of his gun
as planned they take aim at the surveillance cameras on each end of the bank
they miss much to toms chagrin
the crowd ducks mary among them
terror grips the queues
the jerrys try again
no more cameras
and with irao that tom takes center stage
he leaps on the teller counter
ladies and gentlemen this is your captain speaking
my name is tom
these are my assistants jerry and jerry
whyre we doing what were doing you ask
we got one word to say to you folks
shrugging smiles recession
order in the bank employees and patrons are now corralled at the center of the bank
their faces all register pain
and we find out why
they all squat in the lotus position legs crossed like pretzels
to jerry thank you jerry
tom is referring to jerrys demonstration of the lotus jerry does not respond
thank you jerry
mary amongst the crowd watcheson withinterest
bradley elementary school
is in session captained by ravishing ms
lips legs lungs stuff prepubescent wet dreams are made of
aaron nestled mid room tries to keep his eyes straight
he steals a quick look to the back of the room there in the back a blonde boy sits chewing gum
this kid from the slicked back hair and rolled up t shirt sleeves is a sub species of vermin
he taunts aaron a smile opens his mouth and we realize that hes gnawing on a plastic doll head
behind the teller window is tom assisted by a quite voluptuous employee veronica with an iq to match
to the crowd and while i take care of business my associates will be making their rounds
the jerrys leap into action guns pointing
they rummage the helpless patrons for jewelry cash and collectables
please be cooperative and more importantly charitable
wed like you to think of it as donations
for jerrys kids
jerry weaves through crowd waving his automatic wand
people dish out valuables into his canvas bag
he arrives at mary motioning at the bag with the rifle
i have no money
i wasnt born yesterday come on is
what the hell you doing in a bank if you
got no money
im here to withdraw money
this stumps the brainless beast
and over by the teller while hes stuffing her bag
dont hate me cause im beautiful
shes too scared for speech
but back on the bank floor
at her ring give me that
jerry testicles in his throat
tom is out on the floor gun wielding
jerry is with him loot bags in hand
to the crowd no heroes
jerry returns bad news on his tongue
fucking fred flew
a wave of sirens punctuate their state of fuck
it crescendoes around the building
squads of police cars form a noose around the building
teem spews from a transport unit armed for the big tightening
guns and ammo abound
jerry is at the entrance peering out at doom
muttering spelling the end im not going back
mary amongst the crowd takes a glance at the clock one thirty
mary turns from the clock concerned
she studies the situation the robbers an overall glumness tells the story
at the entrance tom
he looks desperate
ready to snap
the hostages huddle on the floor tired
the clock on the building reads school is out
children file out of classrooms
only aaron remains alone to the elements waiting
a ball bounces rolls to his feet
its not a ball
its a dolls head
aarons face dread
a portly man oily thick bellows out negotiations via his horn introducing ted the police captain brock aspires to be warren beatty more like ned beatty
times running out fellas
he turns to his sidekick chad a fellow cop
chads on the phone deliberating an important call
tapping his attention the pizza here yet
hands over the phone tami
ooh one sec
to the bank times
all hells gonna break loose fellas
to phone my koochie woochie oochie ooo
a blast rings out from central fidelity
glass shatters from the entrance
a body the security guard tumbles out and onto the sidewalk
blood and brain exits in oozes where the bullet had entered hes probably dead
the cops ted
rutger and adams they all react guns raised
tom huddles by the entrance gun smoking
cool and suave has succumbed to psychotic
the jerrys are nearby nervous
as are the hostages clumped together in fright
im not gonna say it again ted
re hostages swiss cheese
all of them
times running out fellas
the hostages grimace hell not so far away
i want that car ted
ted punches chad on the shoulders
wheres that car jesus
its out getting your pizza
a car and i want it now
and on this cue the sky answers with a thunderous surprise a car comes crashing down before the bank entrance
it came from the clouds and it looks familiar its the getaway chevy bruised and punctured beyond recognition its hubcaps still reeling from the impact
the sky answers again this time with the tattered body of fred the getaway driver alias the arm
fred lands on the hood of the chevy sinking into its metal frame
shock waves across faces of stone
the cops all look up
at the sky what the
there n the sky a taped figure works his magic of flight
he examines the ground below
and he dives
hancock approaches earth and swings lateral
he circumvents the bank structure flying around and around
trash and paper batter about behind his draft
tom and the jerrys stand shackled in their spots
their eyes wander about lost in confusion
the whir outside subsides
a loaded beat
tom in mid swallow watches as a spectacular explosion of bricks sprays the air inside
a caped figure bursts into the scene amidst screams from clueless hostages
in the blink of an eye hancock has jerry by the collar
with a flick of the wrists jerry is a human projectile en route to the windshield of a police vehicle outside
jerry opens fire on hancock
bullets careen off flesh of steel
jerry rides air and glass out and across the street into another awaiting police windshield
smoke and debris smother the air
and as they subside all eyes fall on the caped figure that is hancock erect in the rubble
mary cant believe her eyes
she surveys every inch of his frame now clean shaven combed comic book perfect
hancock scans the crowd of stunned hostages his eyes pick out the women veronicas wet smile takes him
everybody out please
bodies bang about all moving for the door
mary follows the herd out but her eyes remain on the caped figure until real estate ushers her into the street
paramedics converge on the hostages
the cops are at a loss deers staring down a pair headlights
they train their guns on the bank waiting for answers
the bank floor in shambles
no one in sight
but movement jars us to the back where the bank safe is
we see hancock wade through rubble towards the open safe a thick steel chamber of commerce
hancock arrives at the safe
confronts the object inside tom
there he is in the corner a sweaty piece of misery
tom bears his revolver aimed at hancock
hancock enters the safe
hancock does not respond
im not going back
hancock turns grabs the safe door
slams it shut with a resounding thud
theyre locked in
whatre you doing
hancock does not respond
whats going on here
hancock no response
tom raises his gun and meaning it
tom fires a
shot off hancocks forehead
the bullet ricochets about the steel interior under great velocity
it rips toms right ear from his head
catching the renegade slug whyd you go and do that for
tom retrieves his ear from the ground
tries to put it back clutching his head
steps forward why dont we call it the day
gun raised dont
i told you
im not going back
if youre going to tease cock the damn gun
otherwise spare me the wounded animal act of desperation
i dont got c time for rhetoric and sympathy so
dialogue and come with me and you wont be hurt bullshit
you walk out of here with me and your life is a violent storm
you will be hurt you will be abused
whatever turns them on
either way your days are shit
those are the realities spelled out
whats eating you man
you got half the precinct out there armed trained to blow the tail off a sperm from a hundred yards
youre standing in here cornered three bullets left in that squirter of yours if youre lucky and you got one ear
i dont need the aggravation
i dont need this
man youre jaded
im not asking for a rainbow
you dont got to shower me with respect
just a little
tenderness is all
have you no mercy mister
hes had enough im all out
and as he utters this he approaches tom
close on his trigger finger
on the bank floor where a group of cops now huddle we hear three shots from the safe
the schoolyard it looms in the background as a reference to where we are
aaron occupies this alley and we see what he sees trash and fire escapes and ominous gray skies
dark figures move into this sight they eclipse the heavens
and there aaron is twisted in a contorted heap of arms and legs his body eternally locked within the stranglehold of spengler and erlick both his age
aarons face another black eye makes it a set
rage distorts his mouth out of symmetry
he stares at perceval before him the blonde kid from class
we hear water a stream of liquid something splashing about spraying
perceval hes taking a leak on aarons exposed leg
hancock is swarmed under media lights reporters squeezing through a wall of people police trying to get a piece of this superman
we follow hancocks scope amidst the melee it spots luscious veronica again it spots women all whod die for a chance to suck on his cape
mary hastens after aaron urine soaked and on the verge of tears
he rages down the street while his mother pursues
about to break you were late
i was held up
the asshole peed on me
im dog shit
at the bank
honey were they the same ones
get a grip mom
they arrive home both storming through the entrance and up the stairs
the door slams to signify arrival
school books go flying
mother and son march down the hallway
they are greeted by horus sleep still on his face
how was your day
mother and son if eyes could disembowel
just your average professional building several stories of brick and cement
but all is not well with this typically normal picture
on the top floor outside and on the ledge a jumper stands poised before blood and concrete
his tie flaps in the wind
from an adjacent window a secretary a fireman attempt to get him down
people ignore me
from his vantage a congregation of people swarm below in his honor
a woman cradling a baby watches from a building window across the street
through her teeth youre not unattractive
baldness is not fatal
my wife ignores me
your wifes a cunt mr
we like you mr
the girls acknowledge you we all do
the secretary screams
all attention shifts to the building across the street
the secretary points
on the top floor outside and on the ledge the baby seen earlier diaper clad crawls precariously on the rim of doom
his mothers freaking from the window
below the crowd makes its way across the street
they point and gasp at the infants every movement leaving the jumper by his lonesome
the baby teeters along the edge
it heads for a flag pole dazzled by the red white and blue
it reaches out at fabric
the baby drops from the precipice
on the street people choke on their tongues as gravity pulls the infant down
hancock swoops out of the thin blue swift and silent
he cradles the baby from utter concrete
he deposits the youngster with
the ecstatic crowd they of mostly the female persuasion all form around the savior
we see in the background and across the street the jumper nose diving into the sidewalk without much fanfare
an apartment building engulfed in flames
fire trucks dont even bother with the hoses its too late
around them tenants bemoan the loss of
like a wrecking ball hancock bursts through the burning rubble and surfaces clean on the other side of the building
blanketed under his cape are two little toddlers and a young woman in bra and panties
he lowers them to safety
were in the hallway
where horus kneels
hes bent listening into aarons bedroom in his security clothes
by the tv and in her apron mary watches the news
paramedics have taken the rescued tenants to county general for smoke inhalation but no serious injuries reported thanks to the superheroics of this mystery man
we see footage of the dramatic fire rescue hancock recovering tenants from the pyre plebs and dwellers cheer in exaggerated astonishment
to mary mary
mary blinks back her attention
why is he mad at me
hes looking for answers
tapping the door let me see your eye
to mary i told him about the other cheek
to turn the other cheek
he turned the other cheek and they punched it
ill try again later
horus finds his hat on the table
his eyes fall on mary her back to him
shes glued to the set
what about you
horus turns his focus to the tv more hancock footage
he watches mary
had no idea
on the tv what could you do
horns hat in hand goes to the door
he wants to stay
opens door good thing he was there
i dont know what id do
mary does not hear him
until the door shuts behind her
she turns to face an empty room
coffees by the
a room a place we dont know
its dark save the street light outside
a rhythmic pounding reverberates through this darkness
more intense it becomes
and then a high pitch gasp
two individuals man and woman stumble into view their silhouettes obscure the window
theyre locked at the hips pumping away like high revving pistons
for a second light dances off the womans aroused face its veronica
a her voice trembles oh god
the man surfaces from her cleavage for air his face wet with sweat and saliva
he brushes his cape away from his arm
veronica uncoils yet another orgasm her back arched her breasts beckoning at ceiling
quite abruptly he lets her go
rights his pants
unlatches the window
she paws after him
whatd i do
and with that he floats out into the night
dazed after him hancock
unaware of everything but the storm inside his head
he crosses an alley
a band of thugs neighborhood kids of malcontent surprises him
they recoil at his uniform his gun
they quickly realize that hes rent a security
the leader speaks first hes scarpo as tough as a steel belted radial
the others regroup their drugs
horus keeps walking
look like the man
walk like the man
shit aint half the man
aint half the man
horus simply walks away
a streetlight hums
blinks revealing a deserted alley in sporadic intervals
a slight drizzle shimmers pass the streetlight
pelts a soulful hancock below he moves through the gray dreariness in solitude
he reaches behind his e
withdraws a box of cigarettes
taps himself a stick
how about spreading some of that joy
hancock turns and faces a young hoodlum scraggly in his own slimy kind of way
in a huff he shoves hancock up against the building
presses a gun to hancocks temple
better yet why dont i just take it
in a caffeinated blink he has the hoodlum by the throat via one arm the gun with the other
what are you thinking
the hoodlum notices that hes dangling a foot off the ground one of his sneakers remains in its spot from the swift jolt
the other sneaker teeters on his one foot
and falls to the pavement
fuck me shit
what are you thinking
hancock wrests the gun from his hand
places it into his own mouth
fires two slugs inside
the hoodlum freaks
takes the smoking gun out of his mouth
shoves it up the hoodlums nose
want to see brain
sticks the gun back into his mouth
fires another shot inside
takes it out and this time jams it into the hoodlums mouth
the hoodlum proceeds to urinate in his pants
with his mouth full please mister
i got a baby coming
i got student loans
is this getting through
have a heart mister
hancock the fire inside subsides
cools to a rational state
he lowers the
he spits the three slugs into his hand
deposits them in the hoodlums breast pocket
in the closing hours of business employees pell mell about in preparation for departure
a group of ladies form around a display t
taking in with frothy wetness every inch of hancocks footage
they gasp amongst themselves
horus enters the picture jacket and thermos
he notices the tv its like he cant escape the good news
the tv set
more news on the days activities
mary sits mesmerized on the sofa holding a dish she had planned to dry
aaron surfaces from the hallway lured out by the tv he comes up behind mary his black eyes on the news
youre still up
he rolls over the sofa next to his mother
they watch video clips of the foiled bank heist the crashing chevy the aerial maneuvers the sheer invincibility of this man
theres something about him
i dont know
a female reporter concludes the footage
and so we ask
who is this man
speculation abounds government super experiment an aberration of nature or extraterrestrial renegade
who are you
where are you now superguy
well get together
have a drink
hades a smoky bar in the armpit of town
neon beer signs
this is home to mean people tough guys children of a fucked up god
we cut through the nicotine air to find the bar
a figure hunches on the far end smoking
popping vodka like mountain water in dixie cups
its hancock and his trenchcoat
the long day wears heavy on his face those perpetually red eyes the horror theyve seen
what hes got to do
a mans got to do it
hancock stumbles out incognito frazzled under his guise
up above the sky so dark under the storm clouds
we hear commotion in the side alley
and so does hancock
he peers into the alley
there by a lighted phone booth a whore is fending off a horny john
hancock simply watches she drives her knee between his legs
squeals like a little girl
the john finds a two by four in the dirt
he reaches for it
a cough stops him its hancock and he discourages further violence
up and out of the alley the john flees tail between his legs
a long stare ensues hancock and the whore looking into each others eyes for answers
the whore approaches him
touches his face studies it
moves it into the light
the sage youve been to hell it looks
and youre tired
and in need
hancock his eyes agree
the whore lifts her skirt reaching into her panties
she takes out a matchbook
hands it to him
my business card
to the phone booth my office
hancock inspects the matchbook gina etched inside
correcting vagina gina
aarons room his nightlight the only source of light
mary sits on the bed by her son
just a quick one
i want to
from the black night a dark figure plummets caroms off the side of a building strikes the metal fire escapes crashing into the trash cans below
hancock stumbles from the wreckage the garbage
he leans against the building glazed over with drunkenness
he turns to the only source of light that of a building across the street killybegs textiles looming above the rest
boarded up windows indicate abandonment an urban relic
he stares at the building perhaps sparing more attention than we think it deserves
starts in on the tune
once there was a way to get back homeward
once there was a way to get back home
there on his ass his head a raging inferno hancock listens as if he can hear
aaron succumbing to his mothers song his lids flutter
sleep pretty darling do not cry
and i will sing a lullaby
mary as her voice carries
something overcomes this fevered superman
he begins to unravel
a calm consumes him
it could be marys voice maybe he can hear it and then maybe not
golden slumber fills your eyes
smiles awake you when you rise
hancock wavers on consciousness quite unlike him
sleep pretty darling do not cry
and i will sing a lullaby
and like that a seamless fade into peace he sleeps
erratic traces of an urban landscape jag about
aarons distorted view of his neighborhood comes sharp and in flashes as he is pursued by his tormentors
they chase him from behind hooting taunting poor aaron theyre out for blood
aaron cuts into an alley lungs pumping
but a brick wall stares him down providing no exit
he swallows hard
footsteps approach just seconds away
close on aaron as blood drains from his face
his eyes dash for a garbage can but is there time
they can smell their prey
hes not going anywhere
less he can walk through wall
squeeze through brick
just arriving lets rock it up
they turn the corner attack mode
aaron nowhere in sight
just the brick wall and a trash can
they converge baffled
erlick inspects the solid wall
spengler scratches his head
butpercevals no fool
he spots the trash can
he motions the fellas over
they circle the can
an empty can
no one inside
thats because above them no strings and no cables aaron hovers under hancocks capable arm
in mid air they hang for a second
then hancock takes them away
mary stands at the designated pick up spot pacing like her bladders going to break
checking watch no
a secluded view of the city high above
hancock aaron under his arms rides a light breeze and then lands
aaron scampers away
turns and faces the man
hancock examines the boys face the black eyes
he shakes his head
he reaches for his belt
pulls out a cigarette
of course you dont
nothing but a kid
beat takes a puff smoke no evil
hancock moves over to aaron now backed in a corner
re cigarette ever curious
what its like
aaron shakes his head
hands it to
him go on
give it a try
wont kill you
aaron under pressure acquiesces
he takes the stick
sucks on it
doubles over coughing
tastes like compost
your first stick
then after a few more
it starts getting this
a little nicotine buzz
a while passes and all of a sudden its as sweet as candy
only now it takes a whole pack to get there
and you wont settle till your mouths as sweet
hancock takes another cool drag mr
wisdom waxing philosophical
from manure to pure cane sugar
youre a boy
penis comes knocking
shakes your hand
takes you for a walk
and tells you about lifes simple pleasures
youre a man
and you dont look back
nothing is wholly inert
a step in any direction
youre walking into pockets of evolution
that is living
taking those steps
can start by changing some principles
blank best describes aarons face
heres one very simple
just about all you need to know a mans got to do what a mans got to do
beat smokes i look at your face the shiners
you took a shove and you let it go clean
thats a formula for future abuse
an invitation to the losers dance
letting it go
shakes head bad policy
wont be long fore youre running looking for a place to hide
what am i suppose to do
you do what is necessary
there were three of them
what is necessary
let me tell you something kid
there was this infantry unit you see
thinks about it wait let me put it in kid terms
so you relate ok
theres a fox you relate
a fox and hes walking through what the woods the forests right
next thing the fox knows hes staring down a pack of
and theres this chase the foxs running his ass off over boulders and through streams and but the damn hounds are still on his tail
finally the fox comes to this cliff a precipice
and its what a seven hundred foot drop onto jagged rocks
hes in trouble cause the hounds are closing in and theyre going to tear him to pieces
so what does he think
i jump and i die for sure
i stay confront them and ill get my ass butchered
he thinks stay and least id have something a chance
to slip away maybe
the fox decides to go down fighting make a stand
the hounds come
what do you think happens
thinking about it he gets away
hancock inhales whats left of his cigarette
the fox gets his ass kicked and some
i mean ripped apart by the dogs like cheap fabric
whatre you saying
but you know when the last hound was through with him and hes walking away he hears this noise
its the fox and hes muttering something under his breath
the dog goes over
gets up close
to hear what hes saying
you know what the foxs saying
just before he keels off
now hes gurgling choking on his own blood right
the foxs lying next to his entrails you know
and you know what he says
raises his fist in the air no regrets
you make a decision and you stick to it
like a mans got to do
and no regrets
aaron submitting it to memory
whyre you telling me all this
a beat to think look at it this way
i got to do what i got to do
through the street darts mary eyes berserk in search for herher son
she looks at her watch
up ahead by steps apartment aaron levitating in air
hancock explains this defiance of gravity
he gently lowers aaron on the sidewalk before his mother
she beckons him
like a shield she envelops him with her arms
she stares up at hancock her eyes stricken with fear
or possibly they were awestruck
horus in his bed smothered in slumber
he begins to stir wrestling some unseen dream
he wakes in defeat
close on a tv set featuring a commercial in mid hype
a portly man states his purpose
his name tag reads dr
at the hole institute our experienced staff and cutting edge technology means you need not spend another day in discomfort from hemorrhoidal flare ups
also for anal fissures warts and secondary yeast infections the institute is your complete rectal service clinic
and remember im not just the hole institute spokesperson
im also a client
hole proceeds to exhibit an enlarged photograph of his hemorrhoidal tissues the tv channel changes
a news program in progress
on the living room sofa squats
hancock remote in hand
on the neighborhood robberies in our next hour
world news today
hundreds are believed dead when an explosion ripped through a crowded market place in
hancock staring into footages of bedlam bloodshed
from the tv set maternal cries spew forth grief and anguish
hancock grabs the remote
fumbles around for the power button
he pumps the volume instead the wails intensify his state of panic pain
mary by the tube switches off the mayhem
she studies his reaction now marked with relief
are you ok
i came in to
hope you like chicken
hancock nods watching mary as she retreats into the kitchen
he continues to stare at mrs
longfellow in frenetics prepping for dinner
she catches him looking
looking surreal this superman there on her sofa
a calm while they stare
mary turns to aaron offscreen
horus enters from the hallway disheveled from sleep
he does not see the superman on his sofa
he continues into the kitchen
mary stares at him
aaron appears also staring at him
horus does a what
with his shoulders
mother and son gesture behind him
he turns and beholds hancock rising in full garb arm extended
all eyes on horus befuddled
you know hancock
he comes for dinner
close on hancock
close on horus
man of the house
dinner is served
all the key players present
horus sits facing his son dethroned by the distinguished visitor
to hancock which piece would you like
horus watching everything mary and her every blush
you want milk
it gives me gas
a beat as everyone visualizes a superfart
it makes mom fart too
mary chokes on her food
drops her fork
she maneuvers in the allotted space for the utensil and finding difficulty
hancock grabs the table one arm
lifts it off the carpet and above everyones head
mary startled impressed all of the above
she picks up the fork
horus a chicken leg dangling from his lips in mid chew
not about the labor
or the love of it
beat weve heard this before its about responsibility
with what is empowered in you
the gift of might
exploitation because you can
or a different path
to purvey justice
to correct the ills of man
because i can
faces of profound confusion mary and aaron
but they are charmed his words secondary to his charisma
horus the quiet observer observes
so a job
the essence of the man
not his clothes
its the job
take away the arm
his bodily possessions but not his trade his profession
that case you strip him of what he is
horus a firm grasp of the concept
what line of work are you in mr
clearing throat oh its not like you
what you do or anything
a department store over on third
horus is in the securities business
im a security guard
aaron rises from the table
goes over to the fridge
its a large department store over a couple million in merchandise
on three floors
its a night job
i sit around
youre a security guard
you keep the state of things
its a job
you do it
were in the same business
aaron returns with the ketchup bottle
a frozen moment while horus ponders the implications
he stares at the bottle
aaron could you show me the restroom
aaron points first door in the hall
on the right
he leaves to find bladder relief leaving horus to his family
what do you think mom
in a whisper horus what do i do
at his watch i need to get ready
to horus what do i do with him
when youre gone
i have to entertain this super
she doesnt finish her
a noise interrupts her seizes the participants
it comes from the bathroom the sound of piss urine versus the surface tension
a turgid firehose at full blast
the force of urination grips the room as powerful as the penile mechanism from which it is generated
the toilet flushes
hancock returns to aroom of astonished faces mouths agape
by a few minutes
lost sombre and you could see the flames through the storm
i get there the vessels all over spread across three miles of south pacific
bodies floating in the water shoes kids whod thought it some routine reconnaissance joyride
turns out the only one alive was the captain up against a buoy
crying cause he didnt go down with his men
and hes got to live with it
sprayed his brain all over the dashboard in a parking lot a couple months after
a good man
at aaron did what he had to do
a brief moment while the graphics sink in
no one talks
mary a mixture of repulsion and fascination
in the kitchen in the sink stacks of plates indicate that dinner is through
company has moved into the living room with the exception of horus
aaron kneels besides hancock
mary across from him
making a fist i wanted to kill him
i want to deck him just once
so bad i tense up
like i cant even move
to hancock he comes home crying
it was pissed off
theres no shame in it
to mary were older and we dont remember when
we go god when was the last time
maybe its me
its more an effort now
takes more pain
like its do you have the time anymore
even to look back and recall a moving experience
to be moved
but if you have to remember the last time something touched you
youve missed it youve forgotten how to cry
horus enters the room mr
he observes this magic hancock works over his wife and kid a talent whose nature he has yet to comprehend
horus opts to not disturb their trance
he makes for the door
hancock holds him accountable
ill be leaving too
you dont have to leave
i dont want to interfere
i have work
the original sin oh i forgot to make coffee
she rushes into the kitchen
horus stops her
its all right mary
no ill make it right now
i dont have time
ill grab some on the way
mary accepts it not entirely guilt free
i dont want to interrupt
please dont let me stop you
no i need to go
at mary and only mary the last time i had a meal
an evening like this i was
it was too long ago
i appreciate your kindness
youre welcome here
horus watches everything watching her chest heave under hancocks every word watching his wife slip away
after the bell
ill drop by after school
see how youre doing
horus watches this his son slipping away
the two men leave hancock ushering horus out first
mary closes the door behind them
leans against the door and exhales a sign of relief of despair or of a heart raging wild
the two men appear from the entrance shoulder to shoulder sort of
they enter the street
im this way
hancock points the opposite way
need a lift
its a short walk
an awkward beat while they stare at each other
until finally they go their separate ways horus via walk and hancock with effortless grace via flight
from the sidewalk and awe stricken horus watches hancock merge into the blackness
a look of dread squats on his face
the white fluorescent of the neighborhood donut shop
a frazzled korean woman soon yi watches over holly the trainee behind the cash register
officer rutger and adams sip joe in the corner booth
bleeding heart dyke i know not what
bottom line sheila wont put out
wont blow me
says im keeping poontang on the side
dfuck she know
shit smears man
i dont need it
fuck games fuck dames
i got awife i dont need the aggravation
take a donut hole
horus wanders in lost in this environment
he finds the front counter
the cops watch him
a cup of coffee please
holly takes the order
leaves to fetch it
turns with dread how are you john
god im funny observe anything worth recording lately
things are slow
not for samsone electronics on fifth
got hit on thursday
the guard he was cut up like a piece of meat
anything go wrong you make sure you notify us the authorities
no heroics without a license
you know the procedure
horus he knows the procedure
of course he does
holly returns with the coffee
hands it to horus free of charge
from the back soon yi intervenes
he no have gun
oh i thought
he regular guy
sixty five cents for regular
horus somebody shoot him
marys folding clothes by the dresser busy with thought
aaron squats on the bed his brain going a mile a minute
he plops back against the bed
brings his hand up to his face
makes a fist
whatre you doing
shes taken by this scene
releases fist thinking
mary goes over to the bed
theyre lying through their collective teeth
i was thinking
go to sleep
you know what dad says
tomorrow always feels better
i know mom
after a good night sleep
he says that but hes the one working every night
does that mean he never feels better
hes always feeling terrible
go to bed anyway
she tucks him in
turns off the lamp
and as shes out the door
who is mr
time lapses into the late hours
this town experiences a serene moment a peacefulness which says that this as night as a night will be
looking down aisles of merchandise not a trace of life and not unlike a cemetery
all is dead with the exception of footsteps shoes pacing linoleum
its horus on duty
his flashlight leads the way
outside the sirens of police vehicles charge by real men en route to real work
horus watches them from the window like a kid who cant come out to play
he turns to look across the floor roheim against a chair watching the news on a big screen tv re hancock the trains seemed imminently bound for a catastrophic collision
i bet he gets laid
horus he looks terrible
its dark out here in the night
on the roof
overlooking the community the longfellows apartment building
and marys bedroom
from here we can see her entering from the hallway
she disrobes down to bare back
and from this darkness the red tip of a burning cigarette glows into view
hancock watches from here the cigarette blazes back towards his face intense
a foreign terrain of trees of lakes so clear and blue
they pass below us as we soar through air and mist
the mist clears thrusting us into the dense foliage of a jungle
we penetrate the silence the silence it fades into song the silk mellifluous voice of a woman not unlike marys
her siren call beckons us
takes us deeper into unknown greenery
but the sound of crackling gunshots punctuate the end to song
screams and cries rise from the smoke women and children in hysterics
we quicken to a frantic pace slicing through the growth
rocket and mortar shells explode in our path splitting trees and earth
we remain undaunted
but the wails of suffering continues
until we get there there in a clearing as smoke and debris settle
and we see the remains of a lake a lake full of blood
of mangled bodies floating like flotsam
women and we scream
hancock bolts from his bed horrified eyes cracked with red veins
he is soaked
the orgasmic screams of a prostitute seeps through from the adjacent motel room
the wall behind hancocks bed trembles to the rhythm of each pelvic thrust
his ears tormented
roheim in his usual state of sleep
his lips mutter dialogue from an unseen dream
he snaps out of it
consciousness slowly sinks in
he checks his watch then the area around him
he spots horus slumped in a chair in a thinking posture
horns seems lost in his own blank stare
without looking another dream
i was talking again huh
a deserted street at this early hour
on the curb and by themselves horus and roheim ruminating
that look on her face you know the look when shes almost there
makes you feel like a man
then everything gets blurry and all of a sudden its not my arm thats around her and its not my hand thats touching her and its not even me my
some guy this good looking guy
he looks like the marlboro man only shirtless
the marlboro mans running his fingers through her hair
and her knees
by her ears you know
beat cringing and that look on her face
gets up walk with me
the longfellows apartment
seem from above
clyde exits the building in his morning robe
takes hold of the newspaper
digs through it
mary and aaron they exit surprising clyde
mary gestures at clyde pointing an accusing finger
she seizes the paper from him sending him cowering inside
mary and aaron by the perimeter fence
have a good one
i got to do what i got to do
she watches him go curious
the skys pov the schoolyard
aaron sauntering to class
mary turning walking away
we soar through air and mist
circle a street below
hover over an alley
descend from the clouds into the depths of buildings and fire escapes
mary among other pedestrians head homeward
her pace say shes in no hurry to get there
out of an alley and into the street hancock trenchcoated inconspicuous and in pursuit
j horus waits outside hands in his pockets
he paces uncomfortably
roheim exits the liquor store already imbibing from a brown paper bag
not a word from horus
this stuffs going to kill me
he gives horus a glance
takes another swig
you disapprove i know
sure you do
you disapprove and yet you allow me to drink
to poison myself
without a word of caution
not a word
just take it
you take everything
youre afraid to offend
you dont want to be abrasive
beat ashorus squirms so you suppress
roheim takes another gulp
pulling teeth you shouldnt drink
she left a bad taste in my mouth
i drink to kill the taste
horus has no response to this
youre a good man horus
and youre right
this stuffs no good
its a cowards way out and i know it
he gives the bottle a guilty stare
tosses the bottle into a nearby garbage can
sick of himself what the hell
i can learn to love beverage
from across the street
mesmerized and in a world to himself
the street failing to look both ways
a ups truck strikes the clueless superhero sending him across air towards mary
of superflesh explodes into a jewelry display window just ahead of marys path
glass showers the scene
people hancock warbles out from the debris his trenchcoat reduced to mere tatters
he pulls a severed sleeve from the rubble
looks at mary reposed before him
nothing happened how are you
in unison they turn to the ups vehicle a
mangled heap of steel steam billowing from its ruptured radiator
hancock shrugs a smiles
longfellow rounds the corner and ambles home
he is tired and his face shows it
there to make it worse clyde
hes back getting at the sports page on the front steps
a sudden burst of outrage consumes horus
he approaches the steps with fire and
can i talk to you for just a brief moment
not now longfella
im all blocked up
clyde heads inside with the sports page
he farts as he goes in
along a street somewhere who cares hancock and mary in a cool stroll
mary holds his trenchcoat surveying the damage
what were you doing in the street
the trenchcoat you ripped it pretty good
hancock hes lost
how olds this thing
didnt see it coming
left myself open
itll be all right
its just the seams
i can sew it back
the trenchcoat this
its just the seams
ill take good care of it
youll sew it
and ill re button it for you all right
hancock acknowledges with a smile a slight one
are you okay
he stares at her simply
mary stands alone on the sidewalk looking up at heaven
her eyes search the gray sky for signs of life
there overhead a dot
it grows in size getting closer and arriving fast
and gradually it shapes into hancock
he swoops into view straight downward
pulls on the air brakes and eases into a soft landing by marys side
he is wet from his flight and his hands we notice are cupped together tightly
like a little girl lets see
you have to be quick
come on i want to see
if you blink youll miss it
hancock uncups his hands releasing a billowy mass of white something it hangs in the air and then dissipates into moisture
it showers into his open hands
mary reaches for it
i saw it right
a little cloud
she peers into his hands where only a pool of wetness remains
and with her fingers mary reaches inside to feel the rain
hancock watches this the innocence in her face as her hand touches his
he stares down at her hand
at the wedding ring
mary pulls her hand away
the water is dirty
into his eyes its not your fault
hancock looks away
ive been tired lately
you should slow down
so people tell me
heat upon some thought it must be hard
to always do right
do good when all you want to do is rest
its harder to not do anything
what am i
its not for me
it is about people
when there is despair
i bring relief
i am relief
you know that instant that split instant of time when you realize that the nightmare
the totality of fear itself
that its all been a bad dream
that its safe
that is relief
the infant in my arms
to the hysterical mother
when you can see her face whats rest
it is self indulgence
mary in some advance stage of wow
who are you
its not important who i am mary
where im from
it doesnt matter
im a man
i am every man
sizing up his words you probably get a lot of practice explaining yourself on account of who you are and what you do
do you say that
its like everything you say sounds
like you rehearse them so theyll be that way
i mean not to say that its insincere
i mean maybe its something about you but
it must be hard on you sometimes
hancock stares at his feet perhaps reluctant to answer
but probably not
pulling teeth sometimes
mary allows the moment to sink in
so you never answered
what were you doing in the middle of the street
i was lost
but i think im ok now
trash cans fly
paper swept up and sent aflutter
weve seen this before aaron running for his life and the bullies in pell mell pursuit
he cuts into an alley
looses them momentarily
finds a dumpster to his liking
they zoom by and with great eagerness
perceval strolls after them too cool to sweat
from the dumpster little aaron watches them
until conscience kicks in
a moment to reflect he takes
before long youre running looking for a place to hide
erlick and spengler at a dead end
their trail leads them to a metal fence the alley continuing beyond it
no time wasted they scale it
perceval arrives in time to see erlick landing on the other side
spengler pulls himself over
joins erlick on the ground
shit im not climbing this
just combed my hair
erlick and spengler turn to him through the metal bars
their eyes are of disbelief
checks his hair what
perceval follows their gaze behind him to aaron shivering with clenched fists
rolls up sleeves i just combed my hair
erlick and spengler make for the fence to join the fray
to aaron no biting
i hate biting
kick his ass percy
do him percy
hes your woman
lets have it
while were still kids
nothing from aaron just a lot of balls
dick wad lets go
come on you impotent little gonad
your mother chokes on big hard veiny purple headed shlongs the size of
all aaron needs to hear
he charges comatose
and the pummeling begins
perceval dictates the assault landing blows to the face and body
aaron doing an impression of a punching bag
he wafts at air left and right
save some for us
someone blinks and aaron finds himself on the dirt supine
perceval looms over him silhouetted against the sky
he reaches for his zipper doing that perceval thing
a look of recognition in aarons eyes its going to rain soon
he reacts with knee jerk reflects administering a swift kick into percevals peeing apparatus
a faint squeal eructs from the fellows mouth
he drops like a wet tea bag
aaron gets to his feet ready to book
but he doesnt
whats he doing
kick his ass percy
aaron stares at them behind the fence
then down at perceval fetal position mouth agape
aaron reaches for his zipper zip revenge presents itself
kill him percy
aaron cranes himself over percevals face over his open oral orifice
contemplates his target
aaron to pee or not to pee
he closes his fly
to the boys dont mess with me
he struts out of the alley
shifts into a mad sprint adrenaline taking him away
mary enters from the hallway hush hush
she moves to the closet
changes out of her clothes
not a stir from horus exercising stealth in his efforts to watch her watching her sweater fall to the carpet
mary stands before the closet mirror
does a profile check
she reaches for her bra
and from the mirror catches horus staring
youre still up
she moves behind the bathroom door
just get in
mary steps out of the bathroom buttoning up her domestic attire
she nods affirmatively
are you sick
i cant sleep
she goes to the bed
palms his forehead with her right
palms her own with the left as reference
horus tilts his head away from her hand
you want some milk
ill heat it up for you how about that
no thank you
this hancock s picking up yes he is
he sits there in bed struggling with the words
mary continues dressing oblivious
hell take him home
what do we know about this man
they dont have all the facts about him
hes not a hero
i know that
aaron likes him
i know that maybe ive been neglectful
that i havent been there
mary does not hear him
shes at the mirror fixing her hair
you have to know
id like to be more
like it used to be
before we moved here
notices mary applying are you going somewhere
i have to start on dinner
so how about that glass of milk
horus shakes his head annoyed
try to get some sleep
with that shes out the door
horns alone in bed staring into the vanity mirror at his wretched face
he spots a brown paper bag on the chair
goes to inspect
inside hancocks tattered trenchcoat
oy what does it mean
horus returns to bed distraught
he buries himself under the cover
aaron races down the
last leg of his street
on the steps of his apartment building hancock making himself at home
yes a cigarette smolders from his lips
hancock looks at the boy
they share a second of silence
and finally hancock puts out his hand he approves
aaron triumphant smacks it for five
the dinner table
aaron is running off at the mouth
o his mouth was
open and he just stared up at me it hurt that bad
and while he narrates mary runs her fingers through his hair a mother grooming her child
meanwhile horus listens concerned
i said dont mess with me
just like that
dont mess with me
mom remember that guy in the cop movie
he said that
all right already
hows your mouth
it doesnt hurt i told you
he saw everything from the roof
said i did what i had to do
to mary oblivious he said tomorrow hed pi ck me up again
i thought maybe youd like it if i pick you
god my friends will freak
horus freezes fades back to his meal unheard
through the dim of light horus alone prepares for work
a framed photograph of a distinguished man s sits on the shelf inside the closet he poses in full police regalia stern and proud
horus pauses to acknowledge the photograph
he closes the closet door
on the kitchen floor and under the light mary and aaron mother giving son a haircut
i like it long
horus walks into the living room
in the dark
he looks at his wife then at his son doing their own thing
they dont realize hes there
horus leaves the doorclicks shut behind him
its almost eight
she brushes hair off her apron
moves into the living room the bedroom no husband
she goes to the front door
opens it into the stairway outside
there on the stairs and down below hancock stands on his way up
mary sees him
and they look at each other
in the kitchen and under the light mary
mary is finishing up on aaron applying the last snip
holds up hand how do you make a fist
grabs his head aaron hold it
hancock shoves his fist up close almost between the boys eyes
so there it is the fist this petrified mass of knuckles and bones
it snarls at aaron
hancock holds it there fingers locked together like he cant let go of them
aaron swallows in awe
mary watches her guest the change in him
the sound of her voice takes him
he snaps out of it
hancock its yo ur what
come on have a seat
moms going butcher your hair
shut up kid
hit the showers
and the n homework
i want to talk to him
tell her hancock
hancock shrugs a what can i do
i got to do what i got to do
the big haircut
mary and hancock up close
mary runs her fingers through his hair testing his length
she leans into him
snip goes her scissor
hancock in his seat as hard as marble
he seems a bit lost in her presence
from his position the view consists of mary blossoming in her sweater
and thats it
not a word during this process just the sound of their breaths
erected before us the immediate product of a mediocre haircut he looks plain and un super
he inspects himself via a hand mirror
how do you like it
mary peripatetic putting away things
i started out just trimming for horus
here and there
he had to look just right for the academy says his father a police captain there
when we moved here i pretty much took over as the resident barber
you know to save some money
he was in the police academy
his fathers idea
he went through it anyway like he had something to prove
the validation of his manhood
it tpok everything out of him
he didnt talk for days after he was cut
he took it real hard
i mean still hes not
i mean hes still
edits herself it was a difficult time for hi
i understand that im not intolerant of it the working through process
its just that sometimes
at hancock sometimes i need his strength
is that what you want
what you need
i need to
she kneels to sweep up hair
hancock follows her down
you ever been down the boardwalk at night
theyre eye to eye
mary bursts from her perch regroups awkwardly
aaron stands in the hallway his hair still wet from the shower
inside aarons head my mother hancock
its starting to swell
i think he loosened a tooth
mary maternal duty calls
go to your room
ill get the ice pack
hancock alone and on his knees
he finally rises
heads for the front door
mary returns with the ice pack
its getting late
im going to take a walk
on the boardwalk
she goes to him without words to say
in this silence he stares at her his eyes glazed with thought
good night mary
the clock pm
the store rests in afterhour stillness
horus paces by the side door his ears pressed to the phone receiver no answer
he hangs up
checks his watch
goes to the front entrance and peers out at the street no roheim
the scums of humanity
gina over there marketing her cleavage to anything with a pulse and a penis
she mingles with a bar fly
her eyes locate hancock entering finding a seat
from an adjacent stool a man places his hand on hancocks lap
whispers to him
i wear dresses
how about you
considers nah get lost
the warning comes across quite well the man exits
gina saunters over takes the vacancy
at the other end the bar fly rises
heads pass them for the door
to bar fly meet you outside
the el camino right
the bar fly nods
gina turns to hancock
takes his face in her hands studies him
your eyes are calm
she withdraws her hands
but youre still here
and as she makes for the exit
hancock watches as the night swallows her whole
he inhales the rest of his cigarette pensive
the clock it reads am
horns his flashlight theyre making their rounds
his routine takes him outside via an exit door
a dark alley
horus peruses the premises
heads around the building and to the street
as a ragged figure collapses onto
its roheim and hes been drinking right
horus catches him
they find a chair in the back horus positioning roheim in the light
the old man isnt drunk his mouth agape his face bruised with wounds from a serious pummeling
a chunk of lip dangles bleeds
goes to the bathroom sink for some paper towels
comes back to nurse the wounds
figured i can get you by the front
but you werent there
dabbing the torn lip who
they jumped me
that bastard scarpo and his boys
they were waiting on me
returns to get more clean towels
and comes back
why didnt you come through the back
standing out there in the dark
couldnt find my keys
mustve dropped themin the fight
feels his lip shit
he works himself off the chair
heads inside the bathroom
whatre you doing
into the mirror the old man look at what they did
gave a fat lip to match his big mouth
im for shit

so i can clean the cuts
he leads the old wretch back to the chair
im a waste of time
im too old for this

but you know what horus

the job dont make the man
not the uniform
it starts right here
cause i cant do anything right
fuck up my abcs
a beat at horus but you
why do you put up with this crap
waiting for you at home
horus he just doesnt know anymore
on the rooftop of this building hancock on another end of a marlboro
hair in wet dishevelment
hes a mess
got to do what you got to do
he paces with nervous energy pounding his fist into the other hand
we sense a decision brewing
a desk clock points to am
mary awake undercover
she twists turns
a shadow engulfs the side of her wall smothering the light in the room
mary catches it
rises above her blanket
what she sees outside the window hancock hanging there in non gravity
he stares directly at her
i know youre up mary
i know you can hear me
please meet me on the boardwalk tomorrow morning
its important that i talk to y ou then
and with that hes off and away
were in the staircase where horus is supporting roheim up the stairs
theyre going to can me
no ones canning anyone
no one saw us
watch your step
should be an extra key over the door
in the kitchen mary and aaron the morning routine
something is off this morning like someone threw a wrench into the machinery
mary appears a bit frazzled handing her son toasts
she rushes back to the stove her eggs beckoning
the toasts burnt
aaron inspects his superman lunchbox
you forgot the corn chips
mary serves up the eggs sunny side up
and all over the place
and well go
checks her watch wheres your father
she grabs a comb and proceeds to part aarons hair
you forgot the corn
the comb snags ouch
i was hoping daddyll be home before we leave
you having your period mom
she responds with a brisk slap to the head
we enter an anal retentively neat and manicured living room
horus ushers roheim in
the two pause
remove their shoes
proceed into bedroom
horus sets roheim down on the bed
tucks him under
youre going to be okay
i dont know
you might have solo act tomorrow night
get some sleep
youre a good man horus
washing over it i have to get home now
roheim grabs on to his sleeve
you know what olga said before she walked out on me
her last words to me
she turned at the front door
looked around the room and she says keep it clean
thats it can you believe it
then out the door
but like a
i keep the place spotless
in case she walks through that door one day
at horus with pain i dont think shes coming back
horus struggles homeward his mind in a headlock with anger despair a combination thereof
he moves down his street
looks ahead where clyde stands pillaging his morning paper
clyde spots horus on the approach
smiles at him with impunity
goes back in
on horus you can boil an egg in his seething mouth
fist clenched the morning paper under his arm horus
steadies down the hallway
his eyes target the door at the end of the hall seeing red
he gets there the door
wipes sweat off his hand
and again knock
i ow he fidgets in his spot courage evaporating with every elapsed second
until finally horus is a pile of dung
the door opens
and clyde emerges tall and ugly
hes holding up his pants with one and the sports page with the other
caughtin mid defecation he is none too happy
the box scores are waiting and i got an inch of meat sticking out of my ass
make it snappy
loosing his voice id like my sports page please
i want you to stop taking my sports page
clyde closes the door
he stutter steps
whats the matter you deaf
ill stop taking your sports page
now get out of here and let me
i want todays sports page
my sports page
whats gotten in to you
all of a sudden
you dont even like football
youll get it back
after i take my dump
clyde proceeds to close the door
but horus interjects his foot in the door
i would like my sports page now
after i finish
id prefer it now
whats eating you longfella
without warning horus wrests the sports page from clydes arm a kamikaze move indeed
give that back
horns lunges at his hulking opponent lands a punch into clydes midsection
harmless it tickles him maybe
whyd you go and do that for
clyde belts up has pants
roles up his sleeves
and the massacre commences
he simply tears into horus
slows to the stomach
rights across the face
it ends quickly and without resistance as if horns accepted it as fate
clyde kneels over
picks up the sports page
and as if yawning returns to his room
by the fence mary and aaron
mary with a brown paper bag seems
distant preoccupied in a far away place
are you all right mom
youre acting weird
didnt hear what
im late for class
go home mom
i think its time for your nap
pensive mary begins her walk
to the boardwalk
the door swings open to admit horus battered enraged disoriented
he confronts an empty apartment
a deaf ear
no ones there to console him
he storms out of the apartment
the ocean rages against the shore in the distance and at some muffled volume
up against the railing leans hancock and the remains of a cigarette
his hair drips of salt water hes been here a while one would suspect
come back here
in the background a cop commences pursuit on a thief
the thief dashes by pass an indifferent hancock
the cop follows suit passing by
hancock his gaze wavers not from the distant waters
keeps his balance
trudges down the street to a corner bar
the bar is empty at this hour
the chairs are up the floor swept
a husky bartender unloads liquor in the back
finds a stool
the bartender comes out considers this mans appearance
is this a bar
uncomfortable with his own please
mary stands there on the boardwalk the bag in her arms
its cold this morning
a little wind has picked up
and the clouds theyre alive restless
she finds hancock staring at her waiting for
thank you for being here
is everything all right
hancock has no response
constipated following some its cold
mary and hancock we notice they look good together
at the clouds theyre moving
the turbulence has started
tell me whats wrong
he points to the distant ocean where the horizon curves into darkness
look out there and what do you see mary
i dont know
i dont see anything

but you cant y nu
beat holding on to a thread and thats good not seeing
but for me ive seen it

hancock leans forward
and kisses her
their lips lock twisted and entwined
until mary composing her senses pulls away
the hard sell mary ill take you away
get a real job
ill flip burgers
i dont know what im doing
what im saying anymore
i love him
the death blow
turns from her unacceptable
i love him
one can almost hear lifes precious air seeping out of this superman hed slump over if not for the muscles of steel
mary wants to console
but what can she do
mary hands him the contents of the bag the trenchcoat
the school hallway
he holds a wooden hall pass indicating that class is in session
he swings into the boys room
a large restroom empty
little aaron passes up on the urinals
selects a private stall
zip urination begins
splash segues into drip
aaron shakes off the last drop
and thats the cue for the adjacent stalls arms like tentacles surface from below shackling aaron in his spot
he cant see but from behind the stall door opens
he grabs the back of aarons head
introduces it to the yellowed waters below
splash the head goes in submerged
what aaron sees for the next several seconds yellow the thrashing of
bubbles the shine
of white porcelain at
what he hears the gasping of his own breath gurgle and wicked laughter
the ambush ends
one of them says
dont mess with me
they leave laughing
in the distant little shit
left there and in the stall aaron slumped against the bowl
on the tile floor
a wet rag of piss
mary hurries into the room flustered adrenaline coursing wild
she runs down the hallway to her bedroom seeking solace in horns
the cold empty bed says he hasnt been home
the school front
kids swarm into the streets freshly released from captivity
and there amidst bedlam aaron roughed up and soiled in disgrace
he moves to the curb waiting for someone to take him away
no hancock anywhere
aaron waits hopeful
hancock walks an aimless walk in oblivion a whiskey bottle in his hand
hes been drinking
l i in his path and up ahead a little girl sue beckons at the upper branches of a tree
so innocent her voice hymie
come down hymie
she catches hancock mr
superhero who can fly stumbling by
my hymie wont come down from the tree
hancocks reaction what
she wont come down
she stares up at him with big blue sad helpless innocent eyes
so cool hancock reaches down for a pebble takes it in his palm
finds the little pussy named hymie
and with a simple flick of the wrist
shoots it down
a sharp meow
punctuates the task
hymie drops from the branch limp and lifeless
a thud we hear on impact
so innocent her voice holy fuck
hancock resumes his course taking off and into the wet sky
hancocks drunken flight erratic and dangerously close to
he strikes the corner of a brick tower plummeting downward with the dislocated debris
he bounces off the concrete
in an alley
mary is on the sofa wondering where horus might be
she checks h er watch
the place is empty
on the curb
some trash flutters by his feet
on his face the abandonment of all hope
nobodys coming this is clear
hancock on his back and amidst the rubble
he braces the building to get up
gets to his feet only to be confronted by the police officer from the boardwalk
well call this one officer reed a beat cop with something stiff up his ass
what do we have here
a piece of shit
a slow look of recognition seizes his face this is that superguy
hancock stares at him
he pushes past reed who acquieces willingly
his eyes catch a glimpse of particular pedestrian down the street hancock
he gives chase
and confronts him out of breath
a slight smile hi
turning drunk whatre you doing here
the smile fades i saw you walking
where were you today
you said youd
hancock looking over aarons abused frame
i dont know what youre talking about
where are you going
can i go
you dont want to go where im going
those assholes got me in the bathroom today
trying to hold on and you said youd pick me up at school
hes upset now
im not here to save you
no not my job
dont put that on me
pounds his chest not my problem
not on my shoulders
deal with it kid
you are what you are and
what i say it wont do you any change
youll grow up to be just like your old man
not a damn thing you can do about it
cept grab both ankles hope by the grace of god the reamings gentle
aaron backs away from his angry wrath
im not here to save you
he watches aaron break into a run another youngster dashed against the rocks
in hancocks eyes a
glint of regret
but only a glint
this empty bar
with the exception of horus and the bartender while hes drying some mugs lets call him joey
joey studies him
he takes a mug and begins to fill it
going to blow wheres your bathroom
not in my place bathrooms closed
horus politely stands teeters a bit
thats one beer
tell you what
ill take care of this one
the register aint open yet anyhow
horus doesnt hear him
hes already on the move making a dash for the door
but too late he vomits at the front entrance
in the armpit of town hancock
he lights a cigarette with the matchbook gina had given him earlier
at attention before him gina gnawing on gum heaving in all her glory
ive been waiting
they stare for one horny beat
hancock moves into her
buries his head into her bosoms looking for solace
she takes him in very maternal this gina
the front door opens but slowly
aaron steps inside
from the kitchen mary spots him in his violated condition
he sees her reaction that of shock and like that he runs s obbing into her arms
a phone booth ginas office
there in the back alley and in this glass booth hancock and gina their organs ensnared
theyre pumping away
a surreal sight indeed the red of his cape and the black of her leather
come on baby
the phone begins to ring but theyre busy
let it go baby
just let it
in tears i cant
his arm rips through the glass
he drills a hole into the phone killing it
dont give up now
he lets her down
tears out of the booth
finds the sky
there is movement in the sky above aggressive formations and grooves in clouds once coy and demure
the wind hums its presence toys with fallen leaves
its dinner but all is not well
mary and aaron and an empty chair
they sit without talking
they eat without making a sound
between them a ketchup bottle
the door bursts wide coughing up horus
he locates his chair and plops on it
kisses the carpet
on the ground prone son
go to your room
struggles to his knees
what happened toyou
dad are you wasted
aaron hes not wasted
go to your room
he is wasted
horus rises under great difficulty
feels his way to the sofa
when mary tries to assist he waves her away
go to your room
aaron obliges at reluctant pace
what do you think youre doing horus longfellow
horus gauges her
dont horus longfellow me mary
im not your child
im your husband
horus whatre you talking about
re bruises who did this to your face
horus rises from his seat with mustered strength
but you didnt know about me
mary knows where this is headed
you didnt know i was going to do this to you
a half chuckle i guess i shouldve known
we were married and i knew
at the reception
i couldnt dance
so i sat in the back and watched
you were with stuart olmsted and i watched you dance
in your white dress
and i remember zoning out
for a second just watching you
the little girl next door who used to get into fist fights with her brothers in those patched up toughskins
we met only cause the tallest tree in the neighborhood was in my backyard and you needed to climb it
but that night
god you looked so beautiful i
had to realize it
how much i loved you
one more time
you and stuart danced
and i remember im watching you there with him
together like that
you looked good with him i thought all of a sudden
like you belong
and as i stared across the floor it was the same story with all the guys there that they were more right for you
more right because that night you walked in with the wrong man
why do you say that
because i let you down
im a coward
i cant do anything about it
look at me im breaking up in front of you
and god i fear the day when id have to defend you and aaron
what do i do then
what am i if i cant do that
my own wife family
not a man
ballistic l are
did youre a fool thats what you you think i was completely blind when i married you
something cuts at your masculine ego and its the pressure
the standards unreasonable
the woman she wants me to part oceans
thats the kind of bull shits made of
i went w through it
i was there when the hurt came when the academy said no
and when you felt like hiding
from me and your ownforward
taking rent job i stepped it was you horus longfellow
i didnt take the love away
the closet horus stands there tears almost
he takes to his security retrieving his u rent security jacket
he grabs hat
straightens his hair
puts it on
horns what are you doing
inserts the flashlight into his holster
all that i can do
and with that stumbles out of horus
a dark room somewhere
close on the top of abdr dresser a framed the e picture of a happy ted the police captain begins to rattle
it comes from a bed g twrithingnintherrposit oni over obscured from view iearidin s he can
shes doing the best come on baby
the picture of ted the police captain brock succumbs to the rattle
it drops off
explodes into the rage and fury of an apartment fire
casualties come in the form of cries women and children on the v erge of incineration
hancocks pov a burning hallway flames spewing from every crevice were walking through hell
we see a boy huddled under a table
hancock wraps his cape around him
bolts through the inferno
as glass shatters
and gas pipes erupt
he takes the boy to safety
unwraps the cape
only to see the charred remains of a human body
the cries they continue
the room is dark of course
a bed as the squeaking of springs suddenly stops
a womans voice says
whats the matter
i need a cigarette
but you havent
losing it i need a cigarette goddamn it
he storms from the bed
heads for the bathroom
i dont smoke
whats wrong with you
she rises after him and into view its no other than the tv reporter in the flesh
she bounces over to the bathroom as the door slams shut
whatre you doing
hancock stares into the mirror a face in the latter stages of deterioration
and in disgust he swipes everything off the sink
whatre you doing in there
im calli ng the police
hancock drops his pants
straight arms the wall with his left
and with his right latches on to his magnanimous member
outside and beyond the door the reporter has her ear pressed against wood listening
so there our superhero stands bent over a bit yanking up a storm
his body convulses under said stimulation
cue for the reporter to back away
hancock stiffens in full throttle
up and into a fevered pitch
and boom we hear a he growls
p baby explosion
the reporter leaps back
the bathroom door flies open
hancock emerges buttoning his pants
he brushes pass her
finds the window
and hes off with a gush of wind
the reporter turns back to looks ins everywhere in shambles
b nd in the ceiling i da
apings hole seething still fro s m the l a aunch
the store bathroom
horus his reflection in the mirror
he stares at himself
he washes his face
a blurred wobbly image of an alley
he takes a swig from a fresh bottle of whiskey
he turns a corner
a dark figure jumps him
knocks him against the wall
it is the hoodlum from before
scream and i blow
not you again
hancock in a foul mood
he brushes the hoodlum away sending flesh and bone against the opposite wall
snap goes the landing
he hastens to the body
he moves away
hancock drops against the wall beaten
on the bed rocking aaron to sleep as she finishes off a familiar melody
stroking his hair once there was a way to get back homeward
once there was a way to get back home
her voice grips him
sleep pretty darling do no t cry
and i will sing a lullaby
good night darling
aaron stops her by the door
tomorrow always feel bette r
i horus on a chair his face buried in his two hands
he sits alone concealed in the darkness
in the kitchen mary trying to sift through pieces of the evening
she finds no comfort
she moves to the sinks l oks night
the wind is alive
and dark cloud ut at the deep demonic mary
mary launches back cold
outside the window and in frontrof her hancock suspended in air
the blood red of his eyes p nothing but bad news
and being so he explodes through the glass
glass rains through trance
n the kitchen amplifying his e
maniacal drunk amway anyone
the pursuit commences hancock steadies after mary in retreat around the living room
shes white whatre you doing
hancock closes in
its the haircut mary
strikes his head im pissed
out of nowhere aaron charges the caped psychotic
he trampolines on hancocks back trying to saddle him
dont you fucking touch her
hancock cringes says
shut your mouth
he swats the kid off his back
dont touch her you bastard
youre getting on my nerves
he reaches down and untangles mary from her son she concedes out of fear for aaron
stay back aaron
hancock takes her away like booty
aaron dangles from his cape trying to save his mother
the superhero springs into the night with his woman
through heavy sobs from the depths of defeat rises his attention focused on the bac k horus responds
roehim lost his keys
the back door creeps open
several under stealth
they move through enitrs scarpogand his thugs
horus takes refuge behind the locker allows them to pass
stop grabbing my ass man
horus slides out the back into the alley
he crosses the street to a phone
this dilapidated structure serves as landing pad for hancock easing mary down with him
a swift kick and the oor is no more
he drags her down into the bowels of da roof d rkness
whatre you doing
what i got to do
the sound of distant sirens are heard
they arrive binlthe form of three police cars pulling up from one of the cars officer rutger and officer adams in control of the situation
scarpo and the thugs are at the front door looking out at about
five to ten for armed robbery
theyre in hysterics
they observe as horus emerges from the building across trying to assist the authorities
scarpo recognizes this one security guard
he got out
hes dead man
fuck were dead
rutgers and adams cops with dirty harry delusions
they greet horus as one would rodney dangerfield
you did the right thing longfellow
i saw four
only other way out is through the back
the cops trade laughs
take a hike longfella
get back in your hole and watch the law kick some ass
horus reluctant returns inside his building
rutgers moves to work the speakers his action preempted by the other cops
we got something big going down
shit all units
what the bells going on
at the computer killybegs textiles
the cap sounds like hes chewing the rag
fuck what do we do with this
this is a wrap
come on lets roll
i dont like the smell of this shit
they watcherheasqua d cars move out and away
disbelief would be an adt what the
theyre taking off
fucking no way
horus watching the red and blue light fade into the night
his complexion is the color of liquid paper
the display tv tuned to the showdown at killybegs
re tv check this out fellas
they gather around watching the woman reporter do her thing at the scene
blocked off the streets
already orders for more substantial fire power have been requested by the commissioners office as police surround the condemned textile building in an all out confrontation with hancock superhero turned
fuck you guys know what this means
were off the hook man
the stores ours
what about that security guy
he aint coming back
in unison their flashlights flick on
on horus as he swallows backing away and down the street
see coward run
see coward hide
he disappears around the corner
but something pulls him back
he reappears thinking staring at his feet
destiny awaits him
police units flood this once quiet and forgotten block
teams ooze from vans
cops kneel behind their cars guns cocked
we see ted brock hes on the radio hammering out orders
he looks pissed
rutgers and adams arrive
they take position next to fellow whats with the cap
looks like someone just fucked his wife or something
nervous smiles from the fellas
in the wide expanse of this top floor hancock and mary
he squats before her calm unperturbed by the activities outside
mary huddles in her spot occasionally stealing glances outside
hancock simply stares at her
at the curves of her gentle frame
the alcohols wearing off
they sack the emporium unimpeded
the silhouette figure of horus it enters the back room bracing the wall for silence
he moves into the store
from his vantage several beams of light slice the darkness they indicate the positions of the thugs
horus sneaks in heads for the second floor
thug peruses this department
moving across the floor on bent knee horus concocting some desperate strategy
he moves to the gun counter
slips his hand underneath and withdraws a hidden key
scarpo stuffing his bag with merchandise
he waves thug over
take the show upstairs
the gun counter
horus loads a
its foreign to his hand
he rolls out in search for thug who is by the baseball aisle
horus cocks the
sidles up behind him
from behind behind you
thug swings around with a louisville slugger it swipes the from horuss hand
horus im screwed
thug promptly knocks horus against the bat rack
bats roll spray the floor
thug slips hard on his approach landing heavy on his head
thug comes running gun raised
fa ruscdives for r a goes oose bat his swing greeting thug in the the count
horus stands over the two bodies as surprised as we are
scarpo in full alert
hes heard the commotion upstairs
no answer fuck me
he drops his loot
heads for the second floor cocking his gun
thug hes writhing to music under the privacy of headphones unaware of horus behind him
thug whirls around with a gun catching horus off guard
horus responds with a flash he had acquired from the camera section the burst of light momentarily blinds the thug
and a quick snap of the bat takes out thug
horus dispenses of the camera his adrenaline raging
he commandeers the free gun heads downstairs
but the tv stops him
it displays the siege at killybegs textiles
again we believe that this is a hostage situation
officials refuse to comment but we believe hancock has abducted a woman the identity of whom we do not yet know
horus a look of horror on his face
hes off slowing to a ginger descent at the stairs
makes his way down to the second floor
where he is greeted by a gun nozzle pressed against his temple
youre starting to piss me off
he pushes horus down the remaining steps
horus rolls to a halt
scarpo greets him there
pulling him up by the hair
knees him in the gut
scarpo stands over him s drops to the floor in a fetal p cocks his gun
horus uncoils an accurate kick to scarpos groin
scarpo a dumbfounded look entwined in pain
horus goes for the gun
a struggle ensues scarpo finding horus to the side
strength from god knows where
g takes dead aim with a tremblin bang
knocked from roheim steps forward from the darkness the horus earlier smoking in his hand
did i get him
they look at scarpo
i think i g roheim notices the unconscious thugs on the floor
turns to horus measuring him
whatre you doing here
roheim ed mary called earlier
she was worri about you
those clouds that shroud the sky a crackle of lightning echoes through the they begin to surge neighborhood
and the rain begins to pour
all right so this block is squared off surrounded
the local police force and your cousins are here ready to pounce on cue
ted the pissed off police captain brock stands by his vehicle screaming out orders a bull horn in his hand
let the lady go hancock
or all hells going to break loose
to adams does he know anything else
shes slumped against the wall exhausted
bull horn come on out
hancock seizes his ears the bull horn testing his nerves
he bolts upright turns to mary
he seeks a special kind of healing
hancock closes in corners her
but theres no denying this superman he grabs her running his hand down her back and between her buttocks
in tears no
a sudden burst of anger seizes mary
strikes hancock across the face
he tears himself away
a desperate child help me
bull horn all hells going to break loose
hancock recoils from this noise in veritable pain
clutches his ear
make it go away mary
mary huddles against the wall
she watches on watching him struggle
you are surrounded
theres no way out of this one
no way out
hancock on his knees tears bubbling inside
he shakes it off
do what i got to do
he unloads a punch
the other side
the authorities react
they right their guns
ted brock a picture of grim impatience breathing hard
i want his balls in a jar
they take a good look at him
in a fucking vice
into horn this is the end of the line
hancock pacing the floor trying to marshal some emotional order
he drops to a squat searching for calm
hancock does not respond
youre fighting a lot right now
i know that
theyre out there waiting for you
you feel like the worlds waiting for you
whats your next move they want to know
theres no escape
and the responsibility
you cant shrug it off
i know that
and im sorry
hancock a committed stare into space
can he hear her
if you knew that that i know
that i wont expect anything from you
there doesnt have to be a next move
hancock turns on this
stares at her
he rises from the crouch
mary back to wall on the defensive
stands before her
he reaches back
and removes his cape
he covers mary gently shielding her
from the cold
there is no eye contact
out of patience
he signals to a rifleman atop an adjacent building
the rifleman loads his piece
where the fuck is chopper three
this is a hostage situation cap
weve got a woman in there
fuck the woman this is armageddon
i want that bastard in a body bag
ted waves a go when ready sign
the rifleman steadies his high powered weapon
bullets explode against walls
mary screams ducking to the floor
hancock reacts the chaos throbbing inside his head
and like that something snaps
he bursts out of the building eyes lit with the hell inside
he lands on the wet surface below
roars before the police force possessed
the authorities they pause startled
they open fire
bullets zip through the air and with dead accuracy
hundreds of shells strike hancock the target
they ping off his armor of superflesh
he stares at them all invincible
through this downpour hobbles horus pass police cars screeching by en route to killybegs
a police car sits in front of his apartment lights blaring
horus storms into the room
in time to greet a police officer trying to pry aaron from the bathroom sink
let me go you bastard
let go you little asabite
aaron spots horus in the hallway
he breaks loose running into his fathers arms crying
im sorry dad
i didnt know what to do
hes got mom dad
he came and took her away
what do we do now
horus he hasnt a clue
on the tv a graphic depiction of war at killybegs
theres not much you can do
weve got every man out there already
i suggest you take your son some place safe
let us do our jobs
on the tv mary
im sorry dad
dreading it i have to go
they need me
roheim enters out of breath
he notices the nasty gaping hole in the kitchen
hes got mary roheim
blank uncertain i got to get her
what do you mean you got to get her
i got to do what i got to do
aaron stares up at his father did he just say that
damn right dad
we got to get her
horus at the screen oblivious
what can i do
brain damage runs in this family or something
aaron senses his fathers state of overwhelmness
you ever hear about the fox and the bloodhounds
a helicopter chopper three has since joined the picture of chaos
a strobe light cuts through the darkness and rain zeroed in on hancock
a machine gun mounted inside opens fire a wave of bullets ricochet off the superhero with no effect
cops and s
teams continue their assault its the only thing they can do and its worthless
and on that note hancock retaliates with a vengeance
first to go is the helicopter
he slices through the air and rips the vehicle in half
an explosion punctuates its demise sending the spinning propeller into wild trajectory
it crashes into a cluster of cops heads are severed sent flying
horus sprints through the downpour following the sounds of destruction
at the scene he arrives in time to witness the dismantling of future law enforcement
hancock swoops down toward a patrol car
scares the cops away
hoists the vehicle over
throws it at a band of cops
aaron and roheim arrive finding their places behind horus
they startle him
i dont want you to be here
at the mayhem i need a drink
aaron staring at the massacre a head rolls pass him
it looks pale but well fed healthy
aaron ducks into his fathers chest
in the blink of an eye the police department is no more
the entire block a panorama of bedlam overturned vehicles and mangled bodies
satisfied hancock returns inside the building
from the street we can see horus fumbling through the rubble heading towards the confrontation
hepasses a mutilated body belonging to adams
a revolver dangles from his fingers
horus reaches for the gun and stops
he looks around at the vast destruction and realizes that no revolver will do
he continues forth
mary is on the floor wrapped in cape
hes pumped deranged and hes lost that loving feeling
what have you dome
i made them go away
mary responds to her name like a body to sugar
holding his head the noise
dont hurt him
grabs him itll never go away
hancock responds to it
if youve got anything left
hand over heart and you do i know you do
whatever it was that you felt for me
then you wont go out there
he just looks at her
just let go
and itll go away
please just let go
horns stands there in the rain a feeble frame of a man
he wants a fight
and he gets it
as hancock once again emerges from the building fire in his eyes
you ready to rock it up
horus runs he runs for an overturned s
hancock follows toying with the man
horus disappears inside
come out you little shit
a pause in action no reply from horus
are you a man
he storms out with a rocket launcher
he fires it at the unsuspecting hancock
its a hit and it blows hancock against killybegs textile
it lodges him inside the brick structure
hancock pries himself loose enraged beyond imaginable
he growls looking to retaliate
but theres no horus
hancock explores the rubble by the building
a sudden explosion rips the base of a nearby wall it jars the wall loose sending it crashing down
crunch the concrete rips right pass hancock stuns but does not subdue him
he shakes off the dirt
finds horus down the street
like a rocket hancock heads that way
he gets there over horus grabbing him by the collar
with a swift flick he sends the family man flying
thud as his body careens off the killybegs wall
he drops to the asphalt below
horus in pain something broken possibly
he gets up
tries to walk
hancock on the app roach maintaining a cruel but steady pace towards his wounded game
horns tries to crawl
too much pain
he peddles back against the curb nowhere left to go
hancock arrives looking afully steamed
he stands over horus not unlike scarpo much the situation presents itself he reacts
a kick into hancocks groin muscle chink sliikeyt a soundwofshrugs
bone off metal
horus else can he do
hancock tears a yield street sign it backs ready to strikei es this piece of jagged metal
he takes aim
mary screams in the background
they turn to witness the de physicalization of killybegs textile
they begin to crumble weakened by the wear bricks
and tear of recent artillery
mary braces herself as the floor beneath begins to give
and collapses taking the rest of the building with it
a crash followed by a cloud of billowing smoke
mary is no more
horus he struggles to his feet
pushes past hancock limping over to the building that once was
hancock not a word
he stands in comatose silence looking pale
horus charges the building in possessed hysterics trying to excavate his wife one brick at a time
roheim meets him there in an effort to console
youre wasting your time come on horus
horus lost in the pain
he wont listen
slowly and with a sense of duty roheim joins the excavation
he r olls up his sleeve and gets to work
hancock drops the yield sign
turns to the battlefield in his midst
surveys the carnage
a loaded beat
hancock roars a cry of desperation
he grimaces with defeat
screams because what else can he do
falls to his knees
by a fallen police gun
he picks it up
points it at his head
fires the remaining rounds against his temple
bullets carom off skull
hancock discards the gun
breaks into tears
long sobbing wet tears
into his cupped hands
indeed a surreal sight
engaged to the task brick by brick
horus works his way down
to a lifeless arm protruding from its tomb
aaron in his pajamas creeping down a dark hallway
he approaches a door
sometimes when its dark out so dark its black ill see him
aaron peers through the open door
his eyes wander inside ever so gently
on the bed there him
and it starts allover again
they are in some latter state of coital bliss
you just never forget
