written by john august this script is copyright john august a light rain and crickets chirping
somewhere in the night dance music is blaring but here its only a whisper with a beat
water trickles out of a jagged pipe
splashing up mud the riverlet weaves through hamburger wrappers and sunbleached beer cans spent condoms and an old spin magazine
the tiny stream ripples past glass and trash and the body of a woman
face up breathing
dead grass caught in her braids
her name is ronna martin
shes eighteen and bleeding
bleeding a lot
she tries to push herself up but the dirt around her crumbles
her legs are useless
despite it all theres a smile of perverse joy to her face like shes just remembered the punchline to a favorite joke
you know what i like best about christmas
we hear an engine and road noise
its like you get this box and youre sure you know whats in it
a cigarette lighter flares
were in the trunk of a car with simon baines a skinny brit with surfer hair
he looks around realizes where he is
panicked he starts pounding and kicking
you shake it you weigh it and youre totally convinced you have it pegged
no doubt in your mind
the lighter goes out
its black again

go revisions salmon we keep tight on claire montgomery as she talks to an unseen guest
christmas lights blink behind her
claire contd but then you open it up and its something completely different
i mean its like you and me here
she takes a sip of coffee smiles
she has a bewitching smile
im not saying this is anything its not
this time yesterday whodda thunk it
part one christmas muzak plays
a baby cries
a cash drawer slides shut
on the far side of the checkout stand a stringy haired woman counts food stamps
her eyes are sunken black
shes got a screaming baby on her arm and two rambunctious boys in the cart
theyre wearing pajamas and raincoats
its five a
and the store is almost empty
containers of frozen orange juice spin endlessly on the conveyor belt
ronna martin the girl in the ditch is bagging groceries
paper or plastic
she wears a green apron with a red yule save more button
go revisions salmon paper or plastic
shes been working for fourteen hours and it shows
her intonation doesnt change at all
paper or plastic
finally satisfied she has all her stamps the woman starts looking through the receipt
in the cart the boys knock gum from the stand
you didnt double my coupons
theyre at the bottom
where it says double coupons
she finishes one bag and starts another
the woman is watching her carefully
you cant do that
you cant put bleach in the same bag as food
ronna fishes out the bleach and makes a big show of wrapping it in a plastic bag
dont think youre something youre not
i used to have your job
ronna puts the bag in the cart
looks her dead in the eye
look how far it got you
ronna pulls off her apron as she heads for the back
in the background the stringy haired woman is bitching to an overweight store manager
go revisions salmon dark and dusty packed floor to ceiling with crates and palettes
offscreen a soap opera plays on tv
ronna comes around the corner a thundercloud of anger and frustration
she passes by claire and the british simon at the phone sorting through a crumpled list
simons eyes track ronna as she passes
shes been on for fourteen hours
at her locker ronna misdials the combination
frustrated she pounds the locker then re dials
simon approaches ronna gingerly
claire gives up on him setting to work opening a box of expired cookies
she trades her apron for her coat
i havent asked you yet
answers still no
she slams her locker
she crosses to the time clock
are you menstrual
pre menstrual post menstrual
go revisions salmon one of the three
punches out okay simon
in case you havent heard the buzz the scoop the word on the street im getting evicted
so pardon me if im not in a holly jolly mood right now
claire looks over looks away
ronna heads for the door leading outside
ronna they wouldnt evict you at christmas
youd be ho ho homeless
he follows her out the door
ronna forges ahead ignoring him
is that why all the overtime
how much do you owe
more than i got
ill give you twenty right now for a blowjob
she stops turns on him
her look could freeze lava
the start of a smile
simons just pushing her buttons
ronna do you want my shift
go revisions salmon i havent punched in yet
she only half believes him
simons not prone to benevolence
look my best mates are going to las vegas this weekend
ive never been im told its incredible
if you took my shift i could go with them
beat shes not sold cash up front
he peels off three twenties from his clip
she looks at the money thinking
finally she takes it
beyond exhausted she starts walking back to the store
after a beat
are you certain i couldnt have a blowjob
without turning back she flips him off
go revisions salmon an unsuspecting woman takes a container of orange juice from the refrigerator case
suddenly reaches out through the case grabbing it away
the woman gasps
available cashier to the front
mannie pulls his arm back through with the orange juice
hes on break with ronna and claire
repeat cashier to the front
all eyes look up to the voice of god
one of us has to go
loser goes up
she rips open a case of snapple taking one
mannie is checking out a small printed rave invite
in a flash of inspiration
go revisions salmon we move clockwise with a rapid snooze you lose pace
to mannie re invite can you drive
if you dont mind the beast
i love the beast
off reaction alice in chains
hes not dead yet
substituting lewis carroll
alice in wonderland
claire takes the invite from mannie
dont say molly ringwald
go revisions salmon claire just stands there confused mouthing x
mannie scoops a fingerful of whipped cream from a tub
you cant say malcolm x
hes famous hes dead
thats like a rule or something
nothing starts with x
he puts the tub back on the shelf
thats not my problem
to claire you can challenge
okay i challenge
give me one dead celebrity that starts with x
this is bullshit
i am not working the fucking register
shes winning no sympathy
mannie starts to audibly click the countdown
ronna shoots him a withering look
there is one
i know i thought of one before
a jug of milk suddenly shifts to the side revealing the bulbous face of the manager looking through from the store side
break was over four minutes ago
whos up front
claire looks at mannie
mannie looks at ronna
resigned to martyrdom
go revisions salmon ronna rips off a receipt handing it to a clutchy old woman
starts scanning someone elses groceries
mannie is digging out returns from under ronnas checkstand
he suddenly looks up
some dead pharaoh guy
starts with x
that wasnt it
i never heard of fucking xerxes
pharaoh coulda saved your ass
mannie pushes his cart down to the next checkstand
theres an opera about him
ronna looks up at the customer a handsome college guy adam
hes cute in that fresh scrubbed midwestern way
i took music appreciation twice
adams friend zack is with him in line yabbering on a cellular phone
ronna hits total
adam hands her a credit card
she swipes it through the machine and starts bagging their groceries
does a british guy still work here
he went to vegas for the weekend
go revisions salmon a glance between adam and zack hard to read why
zack nods for adam to go ahead
betcha wonder why were buying all this orange juice
shes not going to rise to the bait
zack looks over at adam then to ronna
checks nametag ronna
you dont know where we could get something to go with this orange juice do you
doughnuts aisle four
but then you get the weird taste in your mouth
i was thinking something a little more euphoric
the british guy usually hooks us up
she stops bagging
looks at adam
twenty at twenty
a bunch of us are going to this party tonight this warehouse thing
he pulls out a postcard sized invite
bright colors slick printing
mary xmas supafest
go revisions salmon and we had planned this kinda pre party
only theres of us its like all or nothing
switterman walks down the end of the aisle headed for the managers desk
low a friend was supposed to get the stuff in chicago but now hes snowed in
so if you could help us out here
all three watch switterman pass
it gives ronna a beat to think
she hands zack a post it note and a pen
go revisions salmon gimme a number
let me see what i can do
its a nice smile
even ronna notices
so do you want the o
the beast is mannies pride and joy a late s toyota held together with duct tape and prayer
its outfitted for the season with christmas lights lining the windshield and back window
santa has replaced jesus on the dashboard
ronna climbs in the passenger door counting a stack of s fresh from the atm
claires in back
you know that simons in vegas
i dont need simon
im going to todd
whos todd gaines
claire sits forward in the seat suddenly worried
you cant do that can you
i mean go around simon
she looks at mannie
he shrugs unsure
ok listen up
if simon were here which hes not he would charge fifteen when i know he gets it for ten
go revisions salmon ronna contd times twenty hits thats a hundred bucks id be pissing out my dick
but its like an evolutionary leap
youre moving up the drug food chain
go revisions salmon ronna you shouldnt do this
ronna pockets the cash
mannies about to say something when she stops him
both of you chill the fuck out
its just once
when simon gets back we can still overpay for quarters if it makes you feel all warm and happy
but this is my deal so just sit back and watch
mannie and claire remain unconvinced
ronna reaches for the keys cranking the ignition even though mannies driving
the engine purrs
ronna contd besides todd likes me
this wont be any problem
a buzzer sounds
ronna stands by the intercom of a two story walkup in hollywood
waiting she looks back to the street where the beast sits idle at the curb
its ronna martin
you know me through simon
a long pause
can i come up
another long pause
ronna looks back at the beast embarrassed
finally the door buzzes and a latch clicks open
stairs lead up
she motions back five minutes to the beast
go revisions salmon three out of four lights are burned out in the hallway
a few feet ahead of ronna a door stands partly ajar
a weird red and green light spills out through the crack along with an alice in chains song
ronna pushes the door open from the hallway
shades drawn the room is completely insulated from reality
the light bulbs have been markered over casting eerie pools of red and green light
broken cds dangle off a tiny christmas tree by the stereo
dont let the cat out
ronna closes the door behind her
todd gaines emerges from the darkened bedroom tying the string on a pair of sweat pants
thats all hes wearing
i didnt wake you up did i
he settles into an overstuffed couch and lights a marlboro
adjusts himself in the crotch
motions for her to take a chair
shes more nervous than she wants to let on
i thought you were still buying quarters off simon
least what simon pretends are quarters
i keep him honest
at that level youre supposed to pinch
its the economics of it
go revisions salmon a woman with a ballerinas body comes out of the bedroom
she tucks an unrealistically large breast down into her tight top
she leans over the back of the sofa for quick tonguey kiss
in a sneak attack she shoves a santas hat down to his ears
he bats the white pom out of his eyes
the woman is out the door without a word
gaines looks back over at ronna not the least bit self conscious about the hat
i take it this is not a social call
i need a favor
i didnt know we were such good friends ronna
because if we were you would know i give head before i give favors
i dont even give my best friends head so the chance of your getting a favor right now are pretty fucking slim
beat you might try just telling me what you want to buy
twenty hits of ecstacy
he takes a deep drag on the cigarette looking at her
blows the smoke out
he picks up a remote control
aims it at the stereo
the volume meter climbing fast
out of the green into the red
the music is deafening
on top of ronna face in her ear
his hand wraps around her head holding her tight
we cant hear what hes saying
ronnas eyes betray her fear
go revisions salmon he backs off
she looks confused
the music still blaring she stands and slowly unbuttons her shirt
takes it off very self consciously
pulls her t shirt off over her head
just her bra underneath
he motions for her to turn around
she does then back
her hands are shaking
she holds them together
gaines aims the remote at the stereo
the music retreats
you come here out of the blue asking for twenty hits
just so happens twenty is the magic number where intent to sell becomes trafficking
todd i would never fuck you like that
how would you fuck me
would you strap it on
he climbs over the sofa to a dresser
in a drawer he digs down through a pile of socks to find a wide mouthed bottle
and an empty tylenol bottle
blows out the dust
whats the occasion
theres this big christmas party thing
warehouse you know
a bunch of us are doing sort of a pre party thing
friends of yours
youre not going to go and try to sell this on me are you
youre not dealing
swear to god
he transfers pills from the big bottle to the tylenol bottle
go revisions salmon this is the real thing
pharmaceutical grade not that crunchy herbal rave shit
dont let anyone double dose or youll be frying eggs off em in the emergency room
one hit per headbanger
he snaps the cap on tight
twenty at fifteen is
i was thinking more like ten
you already did strap it on
its just that i know you charge simon ten
inflations a bitch
he offers it to ronna who doesnt reach out for it
heres the deal
theres of us
i need all of this
but i only have two hundred
i mean thats all i have
gaines undoes the cap of the tylenol bottle starts pouring the pills back out
no hear me out
this two hundred is like a downpayment
you give me the stuff i get the extra hundred from them then i come right back and pay you
see that would be doing you a favor and you know how i feel about favors
i could leave something with you
he gives her a quick look over
go revisions salmon i already got a fucking swatch
i need something i know youll come back for
ronna looks at the tylenol bottle in his hands
ronna kneels down beside the passenger window
knocks on the glass
claire rolls down the window
music spills out
claire could you come up with me for a sec
the release buzzer stops as ronna pulls open the door to the stairs
claire just stands there disbelieving making no motion to go in
forty five minutes
you just have to sit there
hes a drug dealer
dont get on me here
how much shit have i done for you
this is nothing
youre making me an accessory
that bracelet of mine youre wearing is an accessory
you are just some chick whos sitting in an apartment
its not just the matter at hand but years of minor adjustment and one upsmanship
ronna finally drops the bravado
okay no bullshit
i need this
i dont get this money i get evicted
my ass is out the street
go revisions salmon stopping her no claire
i dont have anyone else to go to
i am coming to you and i am asking for your help
forty five minutes
thats like eight oclock
well be back by eight i promise
ronna holds the door as claire reluctantly steps inside
the clock on the dashboard reads
is this it
are you sure
engine running the beast is parked along a residential street in venice
in the drivers seat mannie looks for an address
six forty four
jesus next time ask for directions
he kills the engine
ronna does a quick face check in the rear view mirror
shes out the door moving a hundred miles an hour
she looks back in
mannie shakes the tylenol bottle she forgot
tosses them to her
youre a pro
im a top seeded amateur
go revisions salmon she pockets the bottle
slams the door
mannie tracks her as she circles the car
and im a very happy man
in his palm two tablets
he works up a good gob of spit then swallows them both
theyre bitter as hell
a beefy guy named burke halverson reaches out a hand
damn good to meet you rhonda
when i heard philly got snowed in i thought we were fucked for sure
glad we found you
her pager goes off a shrill cry
she quiets it checks the number
work work work
friday must be a busy night
that was just a friend
only now do we turn to see adam and zack standing nearby trying to look cool
their house is spartan even by frat boy standards just goodwill furniture and as is ikea
what can i get you to drink
some of that orange juice would be great
burke does a hepcat swing through the kitchen door leaving ronna alone with adam and zack
so this party tonight sounds like its gonna be huge
go revisions salmon massive
that would be a synonym for huge
just backing you up
and i appreciate that
go revisions salmon ronna hun we are fresh out of o
adam looks at zack
ronna catches it
back thru door cerveza
he hands her a beer
to burke oh yeah
we bought a whole bunch of orange juice
its in the car
watching them with a lion tamers concentration
burke looks back over at her
now zack tells me you got at is that right
suddenly you got a bathroom
down the hall on the right
let me show you
he moves at ronna strangely
it freaks her out
maybe we could do this first
burke shoots adam a look
ronnas already headed down the hall
they wait silently until ronnas out of earshot
we said chicago you said philadelphia
in black and white video were looking down on wide angle view of the entire room a surveillance camera
we can see the reflection of someone watching
go revisions salmon maybe she didnt notice
go revisions salmon just wait here
keep it calm
burke walks off camera headed for the hall
zack hangs his head
adam looks up at the camera
close up ronna locks the door
she leans back against the frame panicking
she turns on both faucets
she checks the window
she looks at herself in the spotless mirror
burke leans up against the outside of the door listening
she pulls the tylenol bottle out of her pocket
she looks down at the toilet
a knock on the door
everything all right in there
ronnas heart is in her throat
cu the handle rocking back and forth locked
she struggles with the cap
go revisions salmon it finally pops open
a few pills scatter on the carpet
she dumps the contents into the toilet
burke hears it
he rifles through the keys on his belt
ronnas on all fours searching for spilled pills
she tosses them into the swirling water
cu the hole in the center of the door knob
a thin allen wrench slips in
burke forces the door open to reveal standing with her beer cool as an eskimo
she pushes past him into the hall
ronna is headed for the front door
following behind her burke waves at adam block that door
adam steps in her way
ronna hun do we got a deal here or not
turns backing away no
no see we dont
thats what i came here to tell you
i couldnt get anything
she bumps back into adam at the door
burke is closing in
go revisions salmon cmon resourceful girl like you
i dont believe it
i just want to make a deal here ronna
can we make a deal
who the fuck are you
zack chokes a laugh
burke stares right through her
ronna swigs her beer like a trucker
did you know im only
i probably shouldnt be drinking this beer should i
being so underage and all
the men just stand there watching
close on burke dumbstruck
he nods at adam
adam steps away from the door
ronna backs her way out the door never taking her eyes off them
the door closes
adam and zack await the fury
burke looks back to the hallway
a white guy with dreadlocks comes out of a locked door
his name is loop
man i dont know what happened its like the machine just ate the tape
he cracks a videotape against the doorframe pulling out the innards
go revisions salmon mannie v
why would they go after you
the car is parked on the side of another residential street
i think it was simon they were after
he deals all the time out of the store
i mean he makes change out of the fucking register
they didnt know who was dealing just that it was someone at the store
they were fishing
ronnas pager goes off with a shrill beeping
she checks the number
she paged me while i was in there
we go back to todd
tell him they didnt show up whatever
and then just swap the pills for claire
i flushed them
think of something
i need a hundred bucks or hits of x
a long silent beat as both put on their thinking caps
mannie tries to beat down a smile that curls the edges of his lips
he clenches his jaw trying to keep it in
go revisions salmon what
she turns his chin to hold his eyes to the light
theyre wild and dilated
and his smile resurfaces despite his best efforts
you took one didnt you
fuck you mannie
how could you do this to me
i need you now
he sits quietly a scolded dog
i have an idea
a sign over the entrance reads yule save more
christmas musak blares jingle bell rock overhead
the automatic doors slide open to reveal ronna and mannie who split up
we follow ronna who is now wearing mannies black trench coat
the store is almost empty with stockmen beginning to unload palettes
ronna turns down an aisle marked soap shampoo drugs
mannie scans his hand on a upc register watching the laser on his fingers listening to it bwoop
he smiles broadly at an idle register woman who doesnt even look up
he then ducks down behind the counter
he presses the button then cranks the volume dial all the way up
the opening flourishes of a latinized christmas classic blast through the pa system
go revisions salmon the register woman looks up
two stockboys look up
a coupon wielding woman looks up confused but proceeds to push her cart around the end of the row
ronna looks both ways
she starts grabbing boxes off the shelf and shoving them into the pockets of mannies coat
every pill she can find
comes roaring by behind her heading for the front
she tries to duck away but hes too steamed to even notice her
ronna does a quick check to see if she got everything
hurrying down the aisle she swipes a bottle of evian
the two stockboys give a wide eyed spielberg stare
we move to the next aisle where the coupon woman is staring at the same thing
we move again to ronna at the end of her aisle
she just now sees it
angle on mannie
he sticks his hand out
angle on the register woman
she sticks her hand out
their palms meet
their hips come together
and they dance
what starts as a tango spirals into a star search y routine of dips spins and arthur murray nightmares
torville and dean on linoleum
go revisions salmon the stockboys watch horrified but transfixed
the coupon woman taps her shoe against the wheel of her cart
dancing his heart out
his face is red and dripping sweat
hes too out of it to notice
a jet engine roar swirling light
the music is stacked up on itself overlapping and bizarre
for just a moment horrifying
he stops mid twirl
holding himself against a magazine rack
ronna takes him by the shoulder
ronna leans into a fish eye swirl
the roar grows louder continuing as we behind the wheel ronnas ripping open boxes of medication
cracking open jars she spills the tablets out on her hand
were they round or oval
like baby aspirin
she digs through the pockets of the coat seeing what else she grabbed
her beeper goes off
she hits it to make it stop
she pops an allergy pill out of its blister pack
compares it to another pill almost the same
holding them up a or b
go revisions salmon youre sure
i wasnt really looking
making a decision ronna starts popping the rest of the pills out of the blister pack dumping them into the tylenol bottle
her beeper goes off again
stop fucking paging me claire
mannie nurses the evian bottle
a phone rings
gaines picks up the receiver clicking the remote to mute the cd player
hes still shirtless and wearing the santa claus hat
on phone speak
just licking my dick whazzup with you
the crazy horse youll have to look it up
i dont know what im up to
to claire wheres this party at
claire is sitting in the corner holding herself very still
she digs a postcard ish invite out of her purse
he snaps his fingers
she hands it over
on phone its called mary xmas
mary like a chick
like her name is mary not like you marry her
you fucking moron
i dunno some warehouse shit
to claire is this gonna be cool
yeah i guess
go revisions salmon on phone my friend claire here says its going to be a kick ass fucking time
what you know her
to claire its your buddy simon
hes in vegas
hell i dunno
looks at claire maybe
yeah well save a load for me big boy
he hangs up
the cd player is still muted
the silence is vast
gaines scratches an armpit
checks his watch
claire looks away
what do you want for christmas claire
i dont know
do you want to get laid
no you dont wanna get laid or no you do but you dont want to get laid with me
you cant answer that
i mean its like
either way youre fucked
where are they claire
theyll be here
theyll be here
go revisions salmon he gestures like hes going to click on the cd player but instead points it at her
are you a virgin
answer the question
answer the question claire
she doesnt say anything
gaines laughs his ass off
i get it
look at me
i want to show you something
she looks back over at him
he slowly undoes the drawstring to his sweat pants
starts to reach inside
claire watches revolted and disbelieving
his hand reaches between the cushions of the couch where he pulls out a mm handgun
im not kidding
where the fuck are they claire
the gun pointed at her claire is losing her shit
her face squeezes tight like her heads being sucked through a tiny hole
just when shes about to pop
the buzzer sounds
saved by the bell
gaines pushes the talk button on the intercom
smiling gaines hits the door button
claire collects her wits
go revisions salmon ronna looks back to mannie
dont say anything
and try not to look so stoned
he nods wiping a finger across his forehead to squeegee off the sweat
gaines sits pensively on the edge of the couch then smiles warmly
thats no problem
these things happen i understand that
claire smiles relieved
mannie stands behind ronna his gaze carefully fixed on the wall
gaines contd let me just fill out a return slip here and ill have the manager give you a refund
todd im trying to explain what happened
they had already gotten stuff from somewhere else
it was just a case of miscommunication i thought
ronnas voice fades to nothing as we push in on mannie
lays down on a table in front of him staring at him
i can hear your thoughts
mannie squints looks around
he and the cat are alone in the room
xiang kai shek
famous chinese ruler guy
starts with x
go revisions salmon mannie smiles
c chiang kai shek
the cat curls itself
youre going to die
mannie snaps back eyes panicked
its a few minutes later
everyones in different places different moods
mannie hasnt moved at all
handing back cash im keeping fifty
call it interest
todd im really sorry about all this
ronna steers mannie towards the door trying to keep his back to todd
but at the last moment
todd shakes the pill bottle
i just gave you a favor
a smile and here i thought you just gave me head
they trade a look as she exits
gaines picks up the cat gives it a scratch
mannie lies on the roof of the beast arms spread wide cigarette in his fingers
ronna and claire stare at each other a competition neither wanting to exhale first
go revisions salmon hands waving claire struggles to keep herself from laughing and choking
finally she gives in coughing up smoke and snot
ronna blows out a cool ribbon of smoke
go revisions salmon she hands over a wreath of plastic holly
she leans down to let claire pin the holly in a crown around and through her hair
okay at the risk of sounding like
what are you going to do about getting evicted
youre still short arent you
mannies hand flops down to the window
claire hands him the joint
from ronnas p
we see the floor is still littered with dozens of boxes of medicine
she picks up a box
an idea forming ronna sits back up
ronna and claire weave through the densely packed lot where rave goers party in and around their cars drinking and smoking
as they walk ronna pops allergy medicine out of a blister foil pack
she tosses the box away
scanning the lot she points to a mini van
ronna knocks on the window
a nervous teenager rolls it down releasing a cloud of smoke
im kelly and this is donna
we were wondering if you might want to hang out
go revisions salmon ronna and claire are packed in tight with three valley highschool couples
the guys are stoned the girls uptight
theyre all breaking curfew
i think i feel something
its really smooth isnt it
donnas brother is a pharmacist
he got it for us
a look from claire why are dragging me into this
but she goes for it
his name is chip
is it like a wave or is it like a zoom
its like floating
like hey down there hows the ground and shit
i got it
yeah i feel it
is it really that cool
you gotta try it
shit ill buy for you
he pulls out his wallet and hands ronna a twenty
she gives the anorexic girl a tablet who downs the pill with a swig of diet coke
and you know what makes it even better
if you smoke a lot of pot
i mean a lot of it
fila guy nods firing up the mini bong again
go revisions salmon mannie leans against a wall pale and out of it a nauseated smile on his face
low i cant believe you are selling allergy medicine
were out of that
were down to chewable aspirin
a skate punk guy comes up to them money in hand
people are saying you have some really good stuff
ronna takes the money looks him over
show me your tits
he pulls up his shirt to show his skinny white chest
deeming him worthy ronna hands him a pill and sends him on his way
she adds the twenty to her stack
how much have you made
the opening rumbles of an industrial anthem rise as we cut to music builds throughout
standing at the dresser gaines cracks open ronnas bottle
pills spill out on a plate
he counts them pushing them aside in groups with a card
picks one up
looks at it more closely
pulls open a drawer full of socks
digs out the wide mouthed bottle
shakes out a pill
go revisions salmon flicks on a desk lamp
looks at both pills in his hand comparing
he flips over the card on the dresser
the invite claire gave him
with a sudden rage he wings the plate against the far wall
the music explodes and were
a grinding sweating sea of humanity
in the mosh pit skinheads and coked up poseurs run in blind circles
a stringy haired eyeliner boy crashes into who had her own groove going
she shoves him back into the wheel a foot on his ass
claire behind her yells something in her ear
we cant hear a thing
ronna downs the rest of her drink hands claire the cup
thats not what claire meant shes a little pissed but ronna is oblivious
both hands free ronna pushes her way deeper into the eye of the storm
she adjusts her holly crown
shes sky high and loving every minute of it
the line to get in is longer still snaking down the wall
fila guy is talking to a friend in a spider marine shirt
this girl inside
she and her friend have it
the real shit
none of the crunchy herbal rave shit
best twenty bucks you could spend
go revisions salmon we look past fila guy to see todd gaines whos been listening
sweating hard mannie is pressed back against a pole shirt over his head
two nose ringed riot grrrls are drawing a christmas tree on his chest and stomach with a fat magic marker
looking over at the entrance he watches some gapsters move past the bouncers
and behind them mannies drugged eyes go wide with panic
he hunches down
gaines starts looking around the edge of the crowd
mannie works his way into the mob
strobes fire overhead
ronna dances on oblivious
gaines circles searching
mannie fights his way through the outer ring of moshers
through the crowd we see gaines looking in
mannie grabs ronna
she smiles tries to kiss him
he yells in her ear
he has to repeat himself
she looks back over her shoulder
a space in the crowd
she sees gaines
he sees her
the music stops
ronna and gaines trade stares for what feels like an eternity until suddenly
the music blasts back harder than ever
like a shot ronna and mannie are out of there
gaines plows through the crowd coming after them
a side door blasts open ronna dragging mannie by the wrist
they race down the alley
a burly bouncer shouts after them
go revisions salmon re sign on door the bouncer is blindsided by gaines who charges after ronna
ronna pulls mannie into a covered doorway a niche set off from the alley
they hide back in the shadows as races past
ronna kneels down to mannie whos hunched over his knees sweating and shaking
she puts a hand on his sweating forehead
youre burning up
i cant feel my hands
listen to me
were going to find claire and get out of here
ronna half carries mannie down the alley
hes too heavy to lift and too out of it to go much further
he collapses to his knees
she cant get him back up
without warning he heaves
we hear the splash on the asphalt
she props his head back against a dumpster
wipes his face
im going to leave you here
im going to get the car and come back for you
she fishes the keys out of his pocket
mannie grabs onto her arm tight
go revisions salmon i cant carry you
mannie just hide here
just like a little mouse okay
youre going to be fine
aint nobody leaving
she pushes his legs into the shadows
in the distance we hear the rumble of the music
keeping low ronna works her way down a row coming to mannies car
she tries one key then another
we look up to see todd gaines watching her from the hood of a nearby car
hows it going ronna
how are sales
her heart skips a beat
she drops the keys
todd i can explain
im not going to ask you to
he climbs off the car approaching
the thing is its not like im in a highly ethical industry
but goddamn ronna
you fucked me over for lousy hits
he pulls his gun from the back of his jeans
by instinct she starts to move away
a red miata moves down the row behind ronna
she looks to it for help but its already passed
its not what it looks like
i mean it sort of is but its complicated
he cocks the gun
go revisions salmon i know i fucked up but i can make it up to you
im the last fucking person you should be expecting a favor from
i have the cash
i have more than i owe you
so now youre an entrepreneur
at the last moment ronna bolts
she ducks around the corner of a van only to see
doing in reverse
it brakes but theres no time
it hits her hard
she flies up over the roof of the car crashing down on the soft top
her limp body starts to slip down the windshield but finally sticks
seeing the hit
a beat then we hear the engine rev pulling back again
that shakes ronna loose letting her drop over the headlights in front
rolling down the slope at the edge of the field ronna topples ass first into a drainage ditch
her body lands with a sickening thud
stands where he is gun still in hand dumbfounded
he looks to the miata
it suddenly takes off kicking up dirt and grass
for a moment all is quiet
finally gaines tucks the gun into his jeans
one last look around then he starts working his way back across the parking lot
go revisions salmon we stay on ronnas body as we hear the miata suddenly pull away
somewhere in the distance the mary xmas supafest is still raging but here its only a whisper with a beat
with a sudden spasm ronna moves
turns herself over on her back
each breath wheezes and gurgles
she pulls the remainder of the holly crown out of her hair and tosses it aside
she tries to push herself up
her legs wont move
catching her breath she looks to the top of the ditch waiting for somebody to look in
no one does
adjusting herself she slides against a weathered magazine
janes addiction on the cover
she collapses back a new wave of pain
after a beat she suddenly laughs until gradually it becomes a coughing
she pushes her hair back streaking blood across her face
theres no answer
the yelling hurts
she wont do that again
mannie i got it
i remembered who the fuck it was
perry farrells dead girlfriend
x i o l a
fuck i knew there was one
a sudden spasm of pain
she winces sobbing
dont you get it
she coughs as she laughs spitting out some blood
we pull back rising higher until we slowly
go revisions salmon offscreen a soap opera plays
simon is on the phone a well worn employee list in his hands
claire leans against the wall beside him skeptical but amused
she turns a box of cookies over in her hands reading the ingredients
to claire where is jalisco
simon hangs up the phone without saying goodbye
he continues down the list
simon no one is going to take your shift
ronna comes around the corner zombie tired
she heads to her locker
simon watches her an idea forming
ronna do you want my shift
are you serious
i havent punched in yet
she only half believes him
go revisions salmon look my best mates are going to las vegas this weekend
ive never been im told its incredible
if you took my shift i could go with them
we hear an engine and road noise
a cigarette lighter
the flame finally catches and we see simon
he feels around touching the ceiling the walls the floor
hes locked in the trunk of a car
he starts kicking hyperventilating
the lighter goes out
go revisions salmon part two shoot simon keeps kicking
fucking let me out of here
the lighter burns his thumb
he switches hands
listens for a second
the car isnt driving anymore
he tries to catch his breath but keeps getting more panicked
a key scrapes in the lock
the trunk lid opens a crack
bright daylight spills in
simon kicks the lid and pops up ready to swing a tire iron
back off laughing
mofuckin jack in the box
tiny is not black but thinks he is
simon climbs out of the trunk and does a face plant in the gravel
hes shit faced drunk
dude you passed out before we left l
marcus was a tailback at ucla and still has the build
he is black and has no confusion over this matter
simon is about to reply when he suddenly heaves
everyone backs away
tiny takes the tire iron puts it to the side of the trunk
he starts cranking it while humming pop goes the weasel ending with
goes the asshole
go revisions salmon a massive land yacht from the pre embargo era
singh is driving nursing a beer
marcus reads a magazine
tiny talks from the enormous back seat where simon is recuperating
so this chick shes bobbing up and down on my dick like shes fucking marilyn chambers
she actually found your dick
ignoring then she starts going around the ouside you know painting the tree when whack
it hits her in the eye
and her contact its like stuck on my dick
the passengers dont seem impressed
her contact lens
its stuck on the end of my dick
was it hard or soft
what my dick
the contact lens
do you remember if it was a colored lens
that she used to have two blue eyes and now she had one blue and one brown
what the fuck does that matter
leaning over seat it matters because it happened to me
it was my story
i told this story about a year ago
the difference was i knew those small but important details
that and it was true
go revisions salmon oh
the matter just wont drop
yo pull your stinky dinky out of my ass
i was just trying to make conversation
give a nigger a break
singh moans not again
my mothers mothers mother was black
so you say yet we have never seen a picture of this ebonic woman
if you were any less black you would be clear
look at your skin
i see black because i know i am
color is a state of mind
thank you rhythm nation
go revisions salmon its a dive and nearly empty
the guys work their way down both sides of a self service food bar
simon is mostly recovered
so what does valentina do
shes a nutritionist
she also teaches a class at this college
tantric sexuality for couples
she teaches people how to fuck
man i taught myself
to simon you shouldnt eat shrimp
its loaded with iodine
this shit is expensive
youre paying five bucks for lettuce and seeds and shit
tiny up ends the rest of the shrimp cocktail onto his plate
pissed singh scoops away a handful for himself
the guys eat
tiny tries to make a sandwich out of the various foods on his plate but the bread keeps crumbling
thing is most people really dont know how to make love
they just put it in and move it around until they get off
what tantra teaches you is how to prolong and deepen the experience bring it to a higher level
if one man in ten were having the sex im having there would be no war
go revisions salmon whats the longest you and her ever did it
how many times you shoot
fourteen hours you didnt go once
not even at the end
you redirect the orgasm inside
hes greeted with skeptical looks
marcus contd how long does your orgasm last
a couple seconds
ive had orgasms that lasted an hour and a half
swear to god
and i do mean allah
when was the last time you got off
i mean like wet
i havent ejaculated in six months
anyone can do it
all it takes is discipline
you are some kind of obi wan kenobi motherfucker
go revisions salmon tiny contd call me old school but i am still down with coming and going
am i right
simon however is still intrigued
we hear slot machines chiming in the distance
marcus picks a gold card up from the counter
reading todd gaines
the drug dealer
he gets a discount
he let me use it
hes a good guy
hes the good drug dealer
i get confused
well pay cash anyway
this is just to get the room
the desk woman returns with their keys
could you answer a question
checks nametag rachel
hypothetically do you think a man could make love to a woman for hours without ever achieving climax
i think my manager would be better able to answer that question
would you like me to call him over
welcome to the riviera
simon walks away with marcus
go revisions salmon doubled over tiny bangs on the bathroom door
singh emerges pale and sweating
he steps over tiny who crawls in
hanging up his clothes marcus waves away the smell
singh moans lying down on a bed
did i tell you not to eat the shrimp
i have something for you
where did i put it
oh its right here
he gives him the finger
simon is on the phone by the window
over action todd its simon
im in vegas we just got here
what was the name of the place you said we should go
the crazy horse
what are you doing tonight
marcus neatly unfolds his clothes hanging them up in the closet
on phone youre going to a wedding
what is it a rave
from the wall knocking
simon and marcus look to a door by the window
on phone no i know claire
are you going to fuck her
simon points at the knocking door
marcus finally opens it to reveal a year old boy in the adjoining hotel room
who are you
this is our room
simon leans around to look
go revisions salmon oh
what are you doing
raping small children
the boys mother yanks him back from the door shutting it
simon and marcus are fully macked out
marcus adjusts the shoulders of his bright yellow jacket
did i mention how much i like your jacket
theres a reason
the elevator bell bings
simon finds marcus at a blackjack table
let me borrow some money
wheres your money
i lost it the dealer is waiting for marcus to play
he takes a card bust
weve been here five minutes
i was playing this game at a hundred dollar table and i didnt understand it but now i do
i think i figured out how to beat it
let me see your wallet
go revisions salmon simon hands it over
marcus pockets it
you can have it back in an hour
one hour right here
various shots simon wanders bored
he hits on a woman at the nickel slots
when she rebuffs him he turns his attention to the cocktail waitress
simon wanders amid the guests spilling out of the shapiro wedding reception
he helps himself to a glass of champagne
simon shares the elevator with drunken bridesmaids becky goldman and rebecca goldstien
okay if youre from over there then where did you meet these friends
who i dont see
they already knew each utter but marcus i met in traffic school
his accent is suddenly irish
its weirdly charming
mocking een traffic skewl
im a good driver i am
i learned everything from american television
hunter magnum p
the knight rider is an excellent program
the doors open at the beckys floor
they get off
do you want to be getting high with us
go revisions salmon while rebecca smokes up becky tears a kleenex in half
she rolls each piece into a plug shoving one up each nostril
explaining otherwise i cant hold it in
simon hands her the pipe and the lighter
rebecca blows a perfect smoke ring at simon
he smiles a little smoke escaping
she leans close and kisses him
softly at first then harder
theyre a few beats into it when
oh my god
her kleenex is on fire flames in each nostril
hands waving she stands up
the plugs shoot out landing on the carpet which begins to smolder
simon stamps the flames out
becky is crying
to simon tell her shes fine
he kisses her
after a moment her panic subsides
she kisses him back
simon slides between the two beckys three naked bodies clenching and releasing
breathing harder and faster faster until he suddenly stops
the expression on his face is agonizing like a tightrope walker about to lose his balance
the beckys stop to watch him worried he might be hurt
finally he breathes again
go revisions salmon did you go
he shakes his head
a new position rebecca on top and sweating
next to simon becky is passed out and snoring
its only as we look over rebeccas back that we see on the bed simon lies motionless in aching nirvana
his head turns
he sees the flames
and does nothing
rebecca reaches climax with an inhuman series of moans
its on the third of these that the smoke alarm suddenly bleats
it settles into a piercing whine
becky falls out of bed disoriented
sees the fire and screams
rebecca climbs off simon to attack the flames with a pillow beating them down
holding her head together becky tries to reach the smoke detector itself
amid the chaos simon feels for his shoes
in the elevator on the right simon jabs at the button while getting his jeans on
as his doors slide closed the left elevator opens revealing hotel security
gentle christmas muzak
at the sinks marcus wets his fingers to fix his hair
an old texan washes his hands at the next sink looks around for a towel
marcus takes two from the dispenser hands them over
when hes finished the texan sets the crumpled towels on the counter along with a dollar bill
he taps his hat and leaves
go revisions salmon a beat before marcus sees the bill and makes the connection
he shouts to the closed door
i am not a bathroom attendant
not breaking his stride simon catches marcus coming out the restroom
seething marcus joins simon in line for a cab
a white ferrari pulls up to the curb beside them
the ferrari man tosses the keys at marcus who cant help but catch them
keep it close and theres an extra ten bucks for you
he slips marcus a five as he rushes into the casino
simon is cracking up
as we reverse we see the valets are wearing the same yellow sportcoat as marcus
get in the car
top off wind whipping
marcus downshifts letting the engine race as he passes another sports car
the stereo is blasting
pale and dazed simon tries to light a cigarette
it blows out of his fingers
it was his last
he adjusts himself in his seat uncomfortable
shouting over noise question
when youre doing tantra you hold it in at the end right
go revisions salmon no
redirect the energy but you never hold it in
havent you ever gotten blue balls
hurts like a bitch
nodding sort of a dull ache
marcus looks over to simon who is trying to get his breath
empty intersections no traffic to speak of
marcus is looking for a cross street
see if theres a map
simon goes through the glove compartment
amid the condoms and parking tickets he finds one
he throws it out
he tries to shut the compartment but its caught on something
he reaches in
marcus looks over
simon gently pulls out a mm baretta
fascinated he turns it over in his hands
marcus tries to keep an eye on the road
dont point it at me
how do i know if its loaded
first you stop pointing it at me
simon aims the other way out the window
as they drive through an intersection they pass a car full of locals
go revisions salmon simon throws the gun to the floor
marcus flinches expecting it to go off
he checks the rear view mirror
simon picks up the gun again
ive never held a real gun before
its heavier than i thought
great put it back
i want to know if its loaded
how do he starts pulling and pushing on it trying to get the clip out
hes not going to stop until he does it or shoots himself trying
hold the wheel
marcus removes the clip hands it over
simon counts the bullets
i hold ten mens lives in my hand
its a nine millimeter
it doesnt have stopping power
for that youd need magnum force
at a pull up payphone marcus is looking through the map in the phone book
simon is still fondling the gun
this is why i came here
this is america
you want to take one symbol for all of america its not the flag or the hawk
or the automobile
america is about a man and a gun
go revisions salmon simon contd from the american revolution to taking the west killing indians american history is all about access to firearms
in england we cant even own a gun
here its a birthright
beat if i were an american id join the e
the n r a
he tears a page out of the phone book
was this chick thing in the s
chicks with guns
tiny lies on the bed watching a bad hotel porno
singh comes out of the bathroom pale and shivering
i aint your bitch
knocking at the adjoining room door
they try to ignore it but its relentless
finally tiny answers it
what the fuck
its the same boy
you got some smoke
you got some pubic hair yet
go revisions salmon man ive been smoking up since i was eight
where is your mom at
he pushes past the kid
go revisions salmon the mirror image of their room
the same porno plays on the tv
kleenexes on the bed
shes not my mom
tiny rummages through the open suitcases finally finding a bottle of pepto bismol
he cracks the seal and drinks half of it on the spot
are you on heroin
are you kicking
im kicking your ass if you knock again
tiny goes back into the other room pulling the door shut
sodium vapor lights buzz overhead
simon adjusts something in his coat while marcus locks the ferrari
theyre going to ask if you want buy a bottle of champagne
you dont but dont say that right off
champagne means you want a private dance
you cant afford it neither can i
but if they know were not biting they dont even dangle the bait
so champagne is a code
beat what does vodka mean
go revisions salmon nothing
at the door marcus stops simon before he goes in
we have one word champagne
you can order anything you want anything as long as its not champagne
pitch black except for tiny christmas lights
to simons left a skanky middle aged couple plays video poker
at the bar marcus shouts to the bartender the music is deafening
out of the shadows two dancers approach
they split up blonde holly taking simon while brunette noelle heads for marcus
holly offers simon a hand they shake
she leans close to talk into his ear
noelle taps marcus on the shoulder ducks to the other side playfully
takes a sip of his drink
simon points to marcus
holly nods feeling the fabric of his shirt
noelle laughs at something marcus said
holly measures her hand against simons rubs it against her neck
he is staring at her magnificent breasts
at noelles urging marcus flexes his bicep
we come in close as holly leans over to say something
simon speaks first
id like to buy your most expensive bottle of champagne
a curtain at the end blue light overhead
holly leads the way with a bottle of champagne
noelle follows with glasses
behind them the guys
marcus gives simon a look
simon shrugs it off
go revisions salmon the curtain parts letting the women through
from the darkened space beyond a giant bouncer steps out massive even compared to marcus
hes sucking on a lollipop
i need a major credit card
marcus looks to simon who hands over the gold card
reads them the boilerplate
this is a gentlemens club
you are expected to behave as gentlemen
i will be giving you one rule
if you break this rule i will break your arm
are we clear
the ladies can touch you
you cannot touch them
at any point for any reason
is this clear
enjoy your evening
he pulls back the curtain
a mirrored ball spins overhead stars racing across the black paneling
holly nudges simon into his chair
he and marcus sit back to back
as the champage pops we move into a series of overlapping shots noelle licks the foam from hollys fingers
holly rubs the bottle against herself pours
noelle and holly dance together a tinsel ribbon around them
simon adjusts himself in the crotch
noelle lights a cigar for marcus as holly dances alone
holly lifts her miniskirt to reveal a g string
simon cranes his neck back banging heads with marcus
go revisions salmon noelle takes a puff off the cigar
holly straddles simon rubs against him
his hands start to rise
she gently pushes them back down
marcus whispers something to noelle
noelle comes up behind holly moving with her as she rubs against simon
marcus turns to watch
enraptured simon watches the four armed woman on top of him
his fingers start to twitch
noelle kisses the edge of hollys neck
simons hands rise reach
simon grabs noelles ass
noelle and holly both get off him
holly kicks his leg
from behind the curtain vic jr
he heads straight for marcus
the other one
simon tumbles off his chair scrambling
what the fuck did i tell you
he kicks simon in the ass
he fucked up he lost control
am i talking to you
im talking to your faggot friend here
he kicks simon again
holly and noelle stand in the corner
this has happened a hundred times
go revisions salmon vic jr
kicks simon again
stop kicking him
no effect i said to fucking stop kicking him
turns on marcus
he shoves him hard
im not trying to throw down here
another shove you think you can kick my ass
i dont want to try
whacks marcus an old fashioned bitch slap
marcus tries to keep the rage down
feels his nose bleeding
he backs away but vic jr
for a beat no ones sure what happened
we look around to marcus
then finally simon
he just fired
the gun is steady in his hand
marcus checks his shirt
a spray of blood
checks his arm
we hold for a moment the mirrored ball still spinning overhead
everybody back the fuck away
marcus holds his place
blood is squirting out of vic jr
he holds it dumbfounded
go revisions salmon to holly is there another way out
a fire escape door
simon motions for marcus to come
pushing the bar no alarm sounds
they back out into the night
the door swings shut
suddenly an man charges in with a silver
he is vic sr
owner and proprietor
you dont fuck with victor
they shot vic
they went out the back
victor kicks the door open ready to fire
the alley is clear
the bartender comes through the curtain
handing off gun find them
the man races out
victor looks at his sons arm
its bloody but hell live
holly shouts down the hallway
the ferrari scrapes as it takes the curb too fast
from the alley the bartender chases after it finally stopping to squeeze off three shots
none seem to hit
the ferrari tears down the street
taking a left marcus slows down a little
were on an empty street well away from the crazy horse
he dabs at his bloody nose
go revisions salmon in the passenger seat simon looks at the gun in the hand
he suddenly throws it out
what are you doing
getting rid of the weapon
marcus slams on the brakes
it has your fingerprints on it
craning around simon looks for it in the street
marcus backs the car up
suddenly a phone rings
lights flicker on the car phone
do we answer
marcus brakes again
the phone keeps ringing
its probably orange county asking where the hell his car is
its a cell phone
they can trace where we are even if we dont answer
get the gun
simon climbs out and starts looking crouching to look under cars
in the ferrari marcus sits back and kicks the phone with his boot over and over until it stops dead
for a moment silence
then the cars alarm starts going off
marcus screams with frustration
he punches buttons on the keychain but nothing will quiet it
he tries the key in the ignition
it wont turn over
climbing out of the car he kicks it with all his might
simon finds the gun crawling under a truck to get it
go revisions salmon using his jacket marcus starts frantically wiping off the inside and outside of the ferrari
simon joins him
the whole time the alarm is still wailing
satisfied marcus motions that theyre done
he and simon take off running down the street
a bent needle pierces two flaps of skin drawing a line of blood with the thread
victor ties another stitch in vic jr
hes had practice at this
in the background the bartender and noelle are watching
victors tirade is directed at all of them
just because a rapper has a white buddy doesnt mean hes sidney fucking poitier
you check them
you pat them down
gritted teeth i know
to noelle and you you were on top of him
you didnt feel anything
she shakes her head crying
victor contd this thing
this thing is a wall of shit
it is a fucking call from on high that i have to leave
i have to get out before this all just falls in on me
winces with pain
victor contd you know what wakes me up in the middle of the night covered in sweat
you arent any worse than anyone else of your fucked up generation
noelle hands him a towel to mop up the blood
victor contd in the old days you know how you got to the top
by being better than the guy ahead of you
go revisions salmon victor contd contd how do you people get to the top
by being so fucking incompetent that the guy ahead of you cant even do his job he falls on his ass and congratulations youre on top
only now the top is down here when it used to be up here and you dont even know the difference
he finishes the last stitch tying it off
victor contd my generation were dinosaurs
were gonna die
youre gonna kill us off
but youll never be dinosaurs
youre little fucking rats and thats all youre ever going to be
holly looks in holding a gold card
victor motions well
she hands it over
they said they were from los angeles
then they must be staying somewhere isnt that right noelle
noelle nods harder crying again
pale and dehydrated tiny sits on the toilet
he hums the theme to i dream of jeannie
once karen learned these simple rules she discovered blackjack was as easy as it was fun
singh is propped up on one of the beds
hes just this side of death
tiny comes out of the bathroom takes the other bed
steve decided to try his hand at craps
go revisions salmon tiny resumes humming
after a few beats singh joins in with the theme to bewitched
the melodies blend surprisingly well
just into the second chorus the phone rings
he hangs up
who was that
some shit i dunno
in the passenger seat vic jr
flips a cell phone shut
he was working through the yellow pages
theyre at the riviera
victor changes lanes
he slams on the horn shouting at the car that cut him off
climbing out of a cab marcus throws two bills at the driver
simon is already running down the sidewalk
simon furiously pounds the elevator button
with a ding doors finally open
he and marcus get on
the doors shut
in the same shot we whip back to look at the lobby where victor and vic jr
have just entered
they walk calmly but quickly
victor presses the button
the mirrored doors close
half a beat later they open again
go revisions salmon a pleasant retired couple get on
the doors dont close
the woman presses the door open button
the other one honey
she sees her mistake
the doors finally close
in the reflection the man looks back at victor and vic jr
sure is a fun way to spend christmas isnt it
the doors open
this isnt our floor
the man steps out of the elevator looking around
maybe were five
well try both
she reaches for the panel
victor grabs her hand
she gasps startled
without saying a word he shoves her off the elevator banging on the door close button until it finally responds
marcus and simon burst in like a cyclone
marcus grabs his clothes out of the closet
all right listen up
were leaving in seconds
grab what you can
what the fuck
simon tosses singh his wallet pockets the keys
just do it
the panic is contagious
after a stunned beat tiny and singh start moving putting on shoes and restuffing suitcases
a knock at the door
go revisions salmon room service
simon steps gingerly to the door looks out the peephole
a fleshy hand blocks the fisheye
victor and son smile at a couple walking past
when theyre gone a giant orange plumbers wrench drops down from jr
s jacket sleeve
simon backs away from the door freaking out
marcus checks the windows
theyre eight stories above a parking lot
tiny knocks on the door to the adjoining room low hey
the kids mutes the tv
open up the door
look im really sorry you know
its just it would be really swell if you would open this door
its kind of an emergency
go revisions salmon give him the money
he gathers money from their wallets
pulling all his weight into it vic jr
begins to pry the door handle off
the door knob jiggles
whip back to the guys
tiny finally chips in
simon shoves the cash in a wad under the door
the boy counts the money straightening the bills
the door handle bends further further
the far side of the lock mechanism drops to the floor
fingers reach into the hole trying to pull back the bolt
finally catch it
the door swings open revealing
an empty room
in hand victor storms in
checks behind doors and under beds
the suitcases are half packed
singh has his ear to the door
whisper theyre in
go revisions salmon simon peers out the peephole into the hallway
marcus lifts the boy against the wall
whisper if you let them in here they will kill you
the boy nods
marcus drops him
simon opens the hallway door a crack
on the count of three they go
we stay with the boy who sits back against the windows excited and rich
theres a knock at the adjoining door
the boy tucks the money away
with a boom we hear the door being kicked open
it only takes four blows
pointing down the hall
swinging off the railings the four guy race down the stairs
up above a door slams open
running to the cadillac singh feels for his keys
i got em
as simon unlocks the door the other three look at each other should he really be driving
as simon backs out
in the distance victor and son appear around the corner
victor motions to go for the truck
a line of cars wait to pay at the booth
simon slams on the brakes
looking out the back window marcus sees the bright lights of the ram charger approaching
theyre right behind us
go revisions salmon who
in answer to his question the ram charger slams into the trunk of the cadillac
simon cranks the wheel barely avoiding the car ahead of him
not slowing simon aims for the entrance lane where the bar is coming down behind a small nissan
threading the needle simon makes it past the car and the gate
the ram charger smashes through the bar
the cadillac charges out of the parking lot nearly hitting another car as it heads onto the strip
looking back we see the ram charger following them out
but theres still traffic
the cadillac slaloms between taxis and tourists
approaching an intersection yellow light
theres a police car waiting at the stoplight
simon hits the brakes just short of a squeal
they stop in a middle lane next to the cop
simon and marcus look over to the officer trying to be calm
singh and tiny peer out the back
the ram charger slowly approaches no hurry
in the squad car the officer takes a radio call
drunken tourists walk past
the crosswalk switches to a flashing red hand
how did they find us
its their town
im sure they have people
the ram charger pulls in right behind the cadillac
its so tall all we see are the blinding headlights through the back window
singh and tiny slink down
marcus checks the gun on his lap
go revisions salmon the red hand stops flashing
the opposing light goes from green to yellow
simon gently revs the engine
suddenly a lights flashing the police car makes a right turn from the left lane cutting in front of them
the siren is deafening
simon sees his opportunity
go revisions salmon gunning the engine he hangs a hard left cutting across three oncoming lanes
the ram charger tries to follow but the traffic is already moving
over the protest of many horns the pickup finally forces its way through
the cadillac takes a corner hard fishtailing into oncoming traffic
simon pulls it back into the lane
in the rear view mirror we see the ram charger gaining
we have to get off the major streets
take a right up here
no not here
its too late
simon mistook an alley for an actual road
aiming for the alley simon hits a curb on the way in
singhs head bangs against the roof
the passenger side mirror smashes off against the wall
mother of fuck
just inches of clearance on either side the alley runs behind a series of strip malls and office buildings
theres only one way out simons aiming for the boulevard on the far side
looking out back i dont see em
the end of the alley approaches
from the far edge a flashing orange light
a giant street sweeper is slowly crossing the alley
we whip back to see the cadillac approaching
looking back wait no
theyre coming in
go revisions salmon behind them the ram charger gingerly negotiates a three point turn into the alley
wider it scrapes against one side
ahead the street sweeper is blocking one quarter of the alley
a moment of hesitation then simon floors it
the caddy hits thirty forty
engine racing we cant make it
the sweeper is already halfway across the alley
singh braces for impact
somehow simon still thinks he can clear it
at the last moment simon slams on the brakes
theyre skidding towards it
marcus grabs the wheel and jerks it
the front bumper catches the wall sending the trunk slamming against the far alley wall
a ear piercing screech
a ribbon of sparks shoots off as the front and rear bumpers are scraped away
forward momentum finally stops
the abrupt stop sends tiny flying into the front seat where his head smacks against the dash
marcuss seat breaks pinning him
he pushes back but singh yelps in protest
simon blinks trying to figure out if hes alive
with tinys bleeding head on his lap he shifts into reverse
the tires spin in place
the car is wedged in tight sideways
further down the alley we find the broken off in its cracked face we see five ram chargers approaching
a giant tire smashes the mirror to bits
go revisions salmon shifting gears simon tries to rock the car back and forth making no progress
looking over his seat marcus sees the giant pickup heading right for them
the headlights are bright enough to cast shadows
forcing back the seat marcus stands up through the open sunroof
aims and fires
on the first shot vic junior ducks down
two bullets punch through the windshield
the third ricochets off the hood
victor keeps the pedal to the floor
hes not stopping
all four guys duck just before impact
the ram charger crunches into the side of the cadillac pushing it down the alley
more sparks shoot off as it goes
looking ahead the street sweeper has moved past the end of the alley but the far side of the street beyond is a construction area flashing baricades all around
the ram charger will push them right into it
clearing the end of the alley simon punches the gas
swinging wide the cadillac comes free with another crunch
momentum keeps the ram charger heading straight for the construction
victor hooks the wheel hard trying to avoid it
go revisions salmon hitting a parked car the ram charger tips and rolls over landing on its side
it scrapes along the asphalt finally coming to rest
simon fights to regain control the street outside a blur
over his shoulder an oncoming yugo cant stop fast enough
the little car hits just in front of the tire sending the cadillac spinning back the opposite direction
tinys unconscious body flies out the passenger window
marcus and singh both grab hold
as simon rights the spin the cadillac brushes past the green street sweeper still humming along
marcus and singh pull tiny back in inches away from decapitation
simon finally settles into a lane checking the rear view mirror
go revisions salmon we look through the windshield to find victor piled on top of his son
regaining his wits the old man steps on vic jr
gets another foot into the steering wheel climbing up to the drivers door window
victor looks out to see the cadillac turning down a side street out of sight
the cadillac bruised but unbroken heads west
las vegas shimmers in the distance
in the back seat tiny is propped up with a bloody shirt pressed to his head
singh has his feet up to brace the back of marcuss seat
just so were clear
you stole a car shot a bouncer and had sex with two women
you had sex with two women
simon ignores them still checking his rear view mirror
we can be in mexico by noon
i say we split up from there
ill take baja
were going home
go revisions salmon simon think about it
if they were going to call the cops they would have called them in las vegas
they just wanted us gone and were gone
simon checks the mirror checks the road
with a deep breath he tries to believe
peels back his bandage to check the bleeding
his father is at a payphone
in the background we see a tow truck starting to pull the ram charger back upright
on phone tommy its vic
i need you to run a credit card for me
he takes the gold card from his pocket
first name todd
last name gaines
looks to his dad
off screen a soap opera plays
claire leans beside simon
his eyes track ronna as she passes
go revisions salmon low dont
shes been on for fourteen hours
at her locker ronna misdials the combination
frustrated she pounds the locker then re dials
simon approaches ronna gingerly
we stay back with claire who sets to work opening a box of expired cookies
she half listens as ronna and simon have their discussion at the lockers then at the time clock
simon follows ronna out into the alley
claire takes a seat atop a crappy console tv eating an oatmeal cookie
the voices on the soap opera seem familiar
im not the man youre looking for
we both know you were on the pier
you saw what happened to carmen
go revisions salmon we drop down to see the tv
onscreen a police interrogation room
the cop is played by adam
the accused is played by zack
dont forget detective
i was cleared of all charges
i dont care how many high priced lawyers you bring in
eden valley will never stand for your kind of scum
as the music rises we push in on zack
push in on adam
the tv image fades out
adam stands mostly naked his shirt off his shoulders and jeans around his ankles
loop the white dreadlocked guy retapes a transmitter on his thigh
a wire runs up to a microphone on his chest
zack and burke are by the door watching
the bathroom is really cramped
you work out dont you
you have to
its in the contract
no you have a great body
the door starts to open someone trying to come in
burke holds it shut
go revisions salmon hey
people in here
whoever was trying to come in gives up
burke pulls a college sweatshirt out of a shopping bag hands it to zack
motions that hes supposed to wear it
as hes putting it on
just so were clear
whether you get something on this guy or not adam and i are done today
thats how it works right
burke smiles an amused roll of the eyes
seems to me if a guys so concerned about the legal process how come he finds himself getting busted for possession
adam and zack share a look
i sign your form and the whole thing goes away
your lawyer got you a good deal
loop sits back his job finished
is it safe to have a radio against my balls like this
a beep as he presses a button
his headphones register
a small sit down dive in west hollywood
the four men finish lunch
i think my girlfriend watches your show
go revisions salmon tell them what your girlfriend does
she doesnt do anything
theyre not even married and she does nothing
my wife weve been married two years she still takes overtime three nights a week
loop bows to burkes superiority
my wifes a deputy sherriff you believe that
a cop and a sherriff married
its like the freakin odd couple
go revisions salmon i smell a pilot
burke is oblivious to sarcasm
loops pita is self destructing
he eats faster trying to finish before it falls apart
you guys got girlfriends
what am i saying
you gotta lot of girlfriends dont you
you got women sending you their panties
two good looking guys
to loop what do you say
mouth full pussy magnets
if i was not a happily married man i would be rubbing up against you to get some of that
off loops reaction some of the pussy power
zack offers loop a napkin
actually im settled down
four years now
still chewing no ring
draining the rest of his coke burke gets up to dump his tray
to zack how about you
this is a crime
you two should be out getting laid
go revisions salmon loop stands nearby while adam talks to no one in particular
star light star bright first star that i see tonight
burke and zack listen to a radio recorder
i wish i may i wish i might
burke turns the volume down picks up his walkie talkie
on walkie talkie thats good
im getting him
through the windows we can see loop and adam approaching
we hear low chatter as they talk
what does your girlfriend look like
about five eight brown hair blue eyes
i dont think so
go revisions salmon burke drives with loop in the passenger seat and adam and zack in back
to loop zacks girlfriend is fucking around on him
man im sorry
how did you find out
on adam corner of his eye
its no big
i dont really want to get into it
cmon tell us
theres a palpable tension between adam and zack
the others dont see it
i found socks
what red socks blue socks
you know how the good kind of socks have band around the ankle that keeps them from stretching out
when i moved in every one of the socks had that
suddenly there was one sock that didnt
you hear that
we got john sherlock holmes in the car here
we pull into the parking lot of adam turns on zack
go revisions salmon alright
but youve been fucking around too
only after i found out
at the refrigerator section both adam and zack reach for orange juice
both back off
adam motions after you
do you know who your girlfriends fucking
he over articulates as if speaking for a learn english now
zack does likewise
their animosity is palpable
i do not
i have suspicions
mostly former boyfriends who keep calling
what a coincidence
i have the exact same problem with my girlfriend
in fact i think shes been sleeping around on me too
isnt it ironic
dont you think
beat maybe i should start checking for socks too
zacks glare could strip paint
as adam and zack head for the front we reverse to find mannie and claire who have been watching the spat while restocking
gay men are so hot
go revisions salmon zack pushes the cart past the checkstands looking at each cashier theyre all female
adam is starting to panic
in near whispers
hes not here
what are we supposed to do
hes not here
were going to ask
youre going to ask
you look more wholesome
he steers the cart into ronnas checkstand where shes waiting on a clutchy old woman who eyes everything suspiciously
zack pulls out his cell phone fake dials
who are you calling
im giving you an opening
adam and zack approach on either side of the car get in the back
burke and loop are waiting
he wasnt there
the british guy he wasnt there
no we heard
you guys did great
checks notebook ronna
you think she can score
go revisions salmon then thats all we need
its all connected
the circle of life
waiting in the beast mannie drums his fingers to the music
claire is arguing with ronna
she finally relents and goes upstairs with her
burke is watching through binoculars
adam zack and loop are in the car with him
now theyre both going
whats up with that
adam and zack stand around as burke gets the house ready moving furniture and poofing pillows as if its remotely believable
so if she gets the stuff what you arrest her
we try to bring her over
beat see we arrest her and then what
one crack whore off the street
so we cut her a deal
she helps us get this guy
we cut him a deal
he helps us get the guy above him
its just like what happened with you
so sooner or later everybodys working for the man
go revisions salmon adam motions to leave it alone
leaning out the back room shes coming up
burke cracks his neck showtime
go revisions salmon what if she isnt really a dealer though
if you just pulled her into this one thing wouldnt that be entrapment
if shes making this deal shes a dealer
doesnt matter if its her first or her last
we stay on zack unconvinced
zack looks over as burke comes out of the kitchen
he hands ronna the beer
to burke oh yeah
we bought a whole bunch of orange juice
its in the car
ronna has halfway figured out whats going on
now zack tells me you got at is that right
suddenly you got a bathroom
down the hall on the right
let me show you
stepping towards ronna his back to burke
he very deliberately mouths a silent
ronna sees it
her eyes go wider
go revisions salmon in the background burke is trying to look around
ronna turns heading down the hall
up above the camera is watching
for a just a second zack smiles
burke slams zack up against the wall twisting an arm behind him
he kicks his feet apart then starts to cuff him
zack is in considerable pain
to adam now watch what i do with his wrist
i twist it away while i put on the second cuff
that way he cant go after me
he doesnt have any leverage
he releases his hold on zack his hands cuffed behind him
i watch all these cop shows and they never do it right
pisses me off
loop emerges from the back room carrying a big box of videotapes on his way out
hey feel the abs on this one
he rubs zacks stomach
you could scrub laundry on these
re box full hands
loop pauses at the door looking around
hes forgotten something
loop cant remember what it was
im out of it
merry christmas guys
good to meet you
go revisions salmon adam waves
loop shuts the door behind himself
now its just the three men
an awkward beat
were done now right
thats what we talked about
whether or not the deal went through we just had to do our part
go revisions salmon you did your part
he turns to the side offering burke his handcuffs to undo
burke makes no motion to do so
now that hes gone theres something i wanted to ask you guys about
sort of a proposition
beat see my wife and i irene shes my wife were both working on christmas so were gonna have christmas dinner tonight
and i was thinking maybe you guys would want to come over eat some dinner with us
my wife is great youll love her then ill sign your form
how does that sound
actually you know i had plans
with your girlfriend
yes adam in fact
with my girlfriend
beat another then suddenly wow i cant believe i forgot this
i saw your girlfriend this morning and she asked me to tell you that she couldnt make your plans tonight
zack stares at adam a why are you doing this look
go revisions salmon to burke it looks like were both free
zack hits the alarm for his red miata which bwoops
he and adam walk to the door hostility simmering
a prefab nativity scene glows beside the front door
adam pushes the doorbell which chimes hark ye herald angels sing
horrified zack turns to leave
adam stops him
too tall for the room a christmas tree leans back in a corner
the rest of the living room is dominated by a giant leather sofa pit
bored adam lifts a plate to check the imprint
he sets it down straightening it
now its out of alignment with the other plates
he looks around casually
no ones watching
circling the table he fixes all the plates and moves silverware to its proper position
go revisions salmon burkes wife irene is mashing potatoes with considerable zeal
adam leans in sees her dedication and tries to duck out
but she saw him
he sheepishly crosses to get it
while hes dialing irene starts in with the electric mixer
adam doesnt know where to look while hes listening to his messages
he suddenly smiles
irene notices and stops mixing
re phone theyre singing christmas carols
minnesota they do that
she leans close to listen
she continues to lean close uncomfortably close for a long beat
we hear a toilet flush
zack emerges from the bathroom to find burke stark naked rubbing his hands over his body
no stay for a sec
burke sprays more cologne on his hand
what does it smell like
zack shakes his head doesnt know
but its not
go revisions salmon really
i get this for a quarter what that stuff costs
he sprays some on zacks hands who didnt want it
while burke turns to get some underwear zack tries to rub it off on the bedspread
re bedspread its down
so is the liner
it is soft
burke pushes zack back flat the bed
did you hear that
individually wrapped springs
burke climbs onto the bed beside him
i could be doing aerobics over here and you wouldnt feel it
i sure wouldnt
go revisions salmon so zack
would you say youre open to new things
irene is back whipping the potatoes
of course you like your job
you get to kiss all those pretty girls
mock bashful it does have perks
irene pops the beaters out of the mixer hands one to adam
they lick the potatoes off them
tell me something
when you kiss those girls youre not really kissing them are you
its a stage kiss
your lips touch but theres no tongue
theres no feeling
nobody gets jealous
its not real
she takes his cleaned beater from him dumps it in the sink
turning back she kisses him
caught off guard he backs into the refrigerator
its a good three second lip lock
she backs off
theres an awkward beat
see now that
there was a tongue there
honey red or white
now dressed burke comes in with two bottles of wine
zack is behind him at a distance still creeped out from the bedroom encounter
he and adam trade panicked stares
what goes with turkey
go revisions salmon white
irene slides a plate under the candlestick where wax is dripping onto the tablecloth
burke tips the bottle at adam
he doesnt want any more
unless he does do you
this has been great just wonderful but were going to need to leave
adams not feeling well
burke and irene share a look
if you gotta go then i understand
awkward beat but irene and i sort of had an ulterior motive inviting you here
zack looks to adam
he makes it sound sinister
okay youve looked around our place
where do you think we got most of this stuff
adam and zack shake their heads
go revisions salmon j
irene and burke both smile
its actually from confederated products
almost everything in this house is from confederated products from the toilet paper to the mattress to those candles
even that cologne you liked
practiced see confederated products is a multi level direct wholesaling company
that means we dont just sell the products ourselves we also recruit and manage teams who work under us
irene and i started eight months ago and were already bringing in fifty thousand a year in revenues
were the number four distributor in southern california
by march we might be number three
she crosses her fingers
so does burke
we look to zack horrified
now as law enforcement officers irene and i cant recruit distributors from inside the force
its against the rules and wed get fired
so what we do is look for people in other industries
like the entertainment industry
realizing you want us to sell amway
its a different company different quality of product
go revisions salmon zack and adam share a look of disbelief and wonder
walking to the miata adam takes the keys
zack folds a form
i need to do something terrifically unwholesome
i need to bathe in sin
with me or one of your other boyfriends
adam checks a low shelf for the right brand of scotch
zack kneels beside him
i have cheated on you with exactly one guy
see if i tell you you will freak out and it will be drama
bad not funny roseanne kind of drama and i am just not up for it
he finds the right brand
they wait in a short line
ill tell you mine
go revisions salmon you cant wait to tell me can you
you think yours is better than mine
its sean connery isnt it
count of three
with fingers they both count off one
jimmy in makeup
they both stand for a moment bewildered
its their turn at the register
adam sets the bottle down
a doorbell rings
an apartment door opens to reveal a chubby girl in sweats sandra with a cordless phone and giant bowl of popcorn
she drops the former into the latter
is jimmy here
oh my god
shes thrilled and disbelieving at the same time
she fishes the phone out of the bowl
go revisions salmon to phone ill call you back
to them jimmys not here
he went to this thing
let me find it
she cant decide whether to close the door on them or not so she only shuts it halfway
she pokes her head out the door again
you do know dont you
i take no responsibilty
i was only an innocent bystander
but there was once where you missed each other by three minutes
it was so exciting
she finds what she was looking for on the back of the door
peels off a printed card
its some sort of rave thing
takes card mary xmas supafest
he left an hour ago
adam and zack head back down the hall
she calls out after them
youre not going to kill him are you
the little shit owes me rent
at the doors bouncers stamp hands
we move down the line of people waiting to get in stopping on adam and zack
okay i just have to say this
the thing is about jimmy he wasnt even that good
go revisions salmon i know
mediocre at best
and the sounds he made god
it was like having sex with nell
adam imitates the moan
somewhere off greenland hunchback whales were beaching themselves
and the ear thing
hello i have q tips
thats really not necessary
the only thing i will give him credit for is the oral
what do you mean
he was terrible
at some point i just had to stop him and correct years of bad technique
i had to take him by the ears and retrain him from the throat up
when was that
and he suddenly got so much better
that is so disturbing
its like you were there
claire cuts through the crowd with two empty cups in search of beverage
go revisions salmon a sloe eyed blonde boy jimmy makes friendly with the bartender who is too busy to flirt
rebuffed jimmy scans the crowd
zack comes up behind him grabs him by the waist
jimmy smiles kisses him hello
adam comes up from the other side blows in jimmys ear
jimmy is so coked up that it takes him a beat to make the connection
zack plus adam equals bad
he smiles nervously
zack takes a pair of child safety scissors from his jacket
confused jimmy tries to back away
adam holds him tight
grabbing a fistful of hair zack cuts it off at the scalp
he lets the hair fall to the floor
tucking away the scissors he and adam walk off
the tiny miata maneuvers through the badly organized parking lot trying to find the way out
zack gives directions from the passenger seat
passing that was the right you wanted
adam ignores him convinced he can get out this way
a beat later it dead ends in a chain link fence
zack points to his lips
he didnt say a word
adam slams it in reverse backtracking
hes doing about when suddenly we hear a loud thump
by instinct he slams on the brakes
something crashes down on the soft roof
what the fuck
go revisions salmon ronnas face suddenly slams down on the windshield bleeding already
both men scream
her eyes are open staring at them
after a beat they recognize her
oh my god
its that girl
her body continues its slide across the windshield finally resting on the hood
in a sort of spasm adam revs back shaking the body off
it drops beyond the headlights
zack looks past adam to see gaines standing there gun drawn
what if shes
adam pops the clutch and they lurch backward out of there
gaines steps out to watch them go
we stay at ditch level as the headlights retreat
the miata is parked at the far island
adam steadies his hands on the wheel
zack passes him the scotch
he takes a gulp passes it back
the energy is still revved up to we dont let ourselves catch a breath
go revisions salmon lets think about it logically
either shes alive or shes dead
if shes dead then theres nothing we can do
if shes alive then the guy with the gun who seemed to want to shoot her probably did shoot her
so even if shes alive shes dead
adam takes another drink
on the plus side the only witnesses are you me and him
and none of us are going to want to be talking about it
so if you really think about it it didnt turn out as badly as it could have
a girl is dead
snaps i didnt say it went perfectly
adam gets out of the car walks away
zack takes another swig
adam stops at a payphone
a long moment before he reaches for the receiver
with a breath he dials
he hangs up
zack dunks the squeegee back in the bucket
with a wad of paper towels he cleans the hood of the car
go revisions salmon washing his face adam looks at his reflection in the scratched mirror
he steps to the urinal unbuttons
before he can start to piss he notices something strange
he looks down at his crotch
zack throws away the last of the towels as adam approaches
with a finger to his lips adam holds out a mess of tape and wires all connected to a battery pack
its the microphone he was wearing
he stops himself
adam throws the bundle as far as he can
they keep their voices low anyway
they wouldnt have been listening all this time
hello they could have been recording it
everything we said could be on tape somewhere
they would know we did it
an idea what if we were just running lines
for a scene
adam wont even dignify that with an answer
a long moment just the buzz of the lights overhead
with an almost eerie calm
theres a pretty good chance no ones found her yet
go revisions salmon no
if theres no body theres no crime
the supafest is still raging in the distance
adam digs through the trunk of the convertible frantically rearranging the junk inside
he keeps looking around the lid waiting for someone to sneak up on them
zack watches adams fruitless arranging efforts
its a miata
all adams effort hes made enough room for a pizza
well put her in the passenger seat
where will i
in the passenger seat
holding her up
adam shudders at the thought
with a flashlight zack jumps down into the ditch
he nudges ronnas body with his foot
shes dead alright
he rolls the body over grabbing under her arms
he tries to hoist her up but shes too heavy and the ditch is too deep
not moving i cant
what do you mean
go revisions salmon i cant do this
frustrated zack tries again to lug the body out
he cant do it by himself
meanwhile adam is starting to hyperventilate tears swelling
okay listen to me
shes not dead
i hit her and i killed her
he looks around expecting someone to walk up and see them
no you didnt okay
this is all just make believe
this is a scene
shes just acting dead
and youre just acting scared
adam laughs to himself still crying
see theres the lights and theres the camera
watch your blocking
pointing theres michelle in wardrobe say hi michelle
the craft service truck is right around the corner and they have lots of little veggie burgers on the grill
and you can have one if you just help me finish this scene
sniffing can you smell them
can you smell them on the grill
im not delusional
go revisions salmon then take her fucking arms
obeying adam grabs ronnas wrists as zack pushes from below
together they get the body out of the ditch
zack climbs up to help maneuver her into the car
adam freaks out dropping his side
ronnas head hits the dirt
shes not dead
they stand back watching ronna moan as she lies half in half out of the car
if shes not dead that means we didnt kill her
we can just leave her
shes almost dead
we leave her and she dies why did we bother coming back
i mean you still killed her
what do you mean i killed her
christ i didnt mean it that way
i would never testify against you
adam is not reassured
we have to stick with plan a
in plan a she was dead
zack reaches into the car pulling out the club
trades a look with adam who finally acquieces
almost says something doesnt
they both look around making sure no ones coming
zack grips the bar like a baseball bat
adam turns his back covering his ears
zack raises the bar
adam scrunches his face tight
go revisions salmon zack takes two quick breaths
adam opens his eyes looks back
zack isnt swinging
he lowers the bar
they both breathe again relieved
a car alarm drones incessantly the siren interrupted with an occasional back away from the vehicle
weaving through some parked cars we settle on an angry bmw its lights flashing
a small throng of ravers have gathered around to look because ronnas limp body lies on the hood
a familiar face pushes through the crowd just arrived
hey its kelly
somebody beat the crap out of her
moving to find
somebody call an ambulance
after a beat he realizes he should do it himself
he takes off running
look around from the edge of a van in the distance
look shes fine
theyre getting an ambulance
adam keeps watching not convinced
he turns back a thought
what about that guy
the guy with the gun
he could still go after her
go revisions salmon okay listen
girl in ditch thats our problem
girl out of ditch thats her own problem
we did the right thing
thunder rumbles overhead
off adams look
okay approximately the right thing
in a half assed thrown together fashion
adam smiles despite himself
zack points see
that just makes adam smile more
as they walk off we leave the mary xmas supafest still blaring in the distance
too early for the brunch crowd just a smattering of vampires
all around christmas lights are strung with mad abandon
the lights overhead flicker
everyone looks up
thats when we come to find sitting alone at a booth by the window disassembling a newspaper
he finds the comics
go revisions salmon laying the paper flat he tears off the bottom corner of the page and starts reading like a kid his whole body leaning over the table
at the door claire comes in shaking the rain out of her hair
after a beat she does it again as if she doesnt remember doing it the first time
shes tired and wired all nerves and raw edges
theres static only she can feel
she looks right past gaines out to the rain on the street
he watches her but doesnt try to catch her eye
the jamaican waiter walks past her with a pot of coffee
anywhere you want
im meeting people
he doesnt care
claire takes a seat at the table in front of her but its not to her liking
then a booth
she plays with the salt shakers
its only now that she sees gaines watching her
at first she doesnt recognize him
then a light goes on
she climbs over the booth and into his facing him
she turns over his hand compares it to hers
they both have the same ink stamp on the back
hes busted no way to talk himself out
the waiter comes with coffee refills gaines cup
claire overturns the cup in front of her
the waiter fills it
she overturns a second cup points to it
a big weird smile
reluctantly the waiter fills that too
ill pay you back for breakfast
leaning closer dont worry
im not really that hungry
she sheds her coat having great difficulty with one sleeve
go revisions salmon have you seen ronna
he shakes his head
see when we go out we always meet here afterwards in case we get separated
go revisions salmon claire contd it happens more than youd think
ive been paging her but she hasnt called back
the lights flicker again storm still raging
halfway into getting her coat off claire has second thoughts but continues nonetheless
gaines is taken off balance his private space violated
claire finally looks up at gaines smiles
unless you wanted to eat alone
gaines scrapes the last of his eggs off the plate
claire sits with two pieces of toast untouched
she takes the scrap of the newspaper he tore off looks at it
what do you have against the family circus
bottom right corner just waiting there to suck
its the last thing you read and it spoils everything you read before it
you could just not read it
i hate it yet im uncontrollably drawn to it
are you going to
he points to her toast
she slides it over
he slathers on a thick coat of jelly
do you know what i like about you
go revisions salmon what
i dont know
its not your face because youre only medium cute
i think what it is is you might be the first non fake person ive met here
what are you on
ginseng and lotsa caffeine
gaines leaves money for the check
claire looks around at the various decorations a red tree by the door snowflakes on the window lights blinking on the wall
go revisions salmon you know what i like best about christmas
its like you get this box and youre sure you know whats in it
you shake it you weigh it and youre totally convinced you have it pegged
no doubt in your mind
but then you open it up and its something completely different
i mean its like you and me here
she has a bewitching smile
im not saying this is anything its not
this time yesterday whodda thunk it
claire kisses gaines pinning him against the wall
rain beats against the door
she fumbles with his belt
his hand slides under her jacket trying to undo her bra
they take a break from undressing to kiss harder
reclining on the steps claire tries to push his jeans down with her toes
her foot gets caught in the chain from his wallet
her butt slides down a step
her hand hits something hard his gun
its tucked into his jacket pocket
as they start to work up a rhythm huxley the cat comes down the steps curious
he brushes against them unnoticed
finally he mews
stopping how did you get out
he looks to the top of the stairs where a man is watching them
go revisions salmon he has the silver
drawn on them
gaines looks down to the door at the bottom
is blocking it
claire looks around trying to figure out whats happening
gaines draws a map for victor on the coffee table
simons apartment is around the back the gates always open
now youre going to take sunset to hyperion
as hes talking we move to reveal vic jr
by the door holding the gun on them and claire sitting on the couch beside gaines
at hillhurst you have to keep right you want sunset boulevard not sunset drive
to gaines why dont you just drive him there
maybe you could help pull the trigger
gaines gives her a look
victor takes the map and folds it
he hands gaines back his credit card
just then we hear a sound at the door a gentle knock
all eyes go to look
close on the doorknob someone trying it
we tilt up to reveal the opener is actually
he charges right into the room shutting the door behind him
todd listen i need hide out here
you wont believe the shit we got into in
he sees victor
he immediately reaches for his gun but go revisions salmon is right behind him
he yanks simons gun away then half pushes half carries him forward slamming him down claire and gaines both scoot back freaked
puts the gun to simons head
panicked simon squirms trying to look around
his face is mushed against the glass
how was your drive
victor hands the gun off to vic jr
who rests it at the back of simons head
simon is moments away from execution
all at once
not here not now
i this is so not where you want dont wanna die
to be doing this
cocks the gun
at the last moment
you cant do this
you wont get away with it
for a brief moment she has their attention
she points to herself
re todd witness
what are you going to do kill us too
gaines looks over thanks for bringing that up
but claire still has the floor
what is wrong with you people
do you think this is an effective way of dealing with problems
this fuck shot my boy
go revisions salmon in the arm
leans on him shut up
to victor so what
youre going to kill three people
beat no answer what do you actually want
a look between all parties
sitting in the green chair simon makes an x on his bicep with a marker
he feels for the bone
its all flesh here it should be okay
gaines and the vics stand around him
in the background claire is dubious and horrified
puts todds gun to the x
gaines hands simon a shirt to mop up the blood
on some sick level hes really into this
gets ready to shoot
everyone subtly backs away bracing for the gunshot
but theres no bang
everyone looks at vic jr
he pulls the gun away
go revisions salmon what do you mean you cant
its hard to shoot somebody beat who knows theyre gonna be you pull the fucking trigger
its all right
claire rolls her eyes this is going to take forever
while the vics argue claire grabs her coat and purse
where are you going
i gotta get to work
todd doesnt want her to leave but really what can he say
everyone turns to watch claire leave
look now the girls leaving
see you claire
we follow her out the door
as she exits
in the background the vic jr
is psyching himself up again
claire shuts the door behind her
as shes headed for the steps we hear a gunshot
she flinches but keeps walking
go revisions salmon see scene ronna wakes up a bit at a time an iv dripping overhead
we hear carolers singing in the distance
her nose crinkles her tongue finds her lips
finally a swollen eye opens looks around
a mexican family is gathered around the other bed in the room the father dressed as santa claus
ronna sees the iv dangling from her arm
she sits up with difficulty a head rush
she tries to get her bearings but genuinely doesnt know how she got here
after a beat she rips off the tape and carefuly pulls the needle out of her arm
its stopped raining but the pavement is still wet
ronna slides her time card into the machine which punches down
ronna ties her apron as she heads to the front limping a bit
claire finishes bagging groceries
looks up to see ronna coming to open the next register
claire doesnt say anything a pointed silence
ronna keys in checks the drawer
claire returns to her register
ronna tries to make eye contact but no luck
go revisions salmon okay real mature
claire continues to ignore her turning her back
she straightens coupons rubber banding them
mistakes were made
things didnt go exactly as planned
claires eyes understatement
but it wasnt exactly a banner night for me either
claire stops disbelieving if ronna only knew
she turns on her then back to the register holding it in
but she just has to face her to say
you are constantly using us
you use me
come on if it werent for me you would be sitting home every night eating popcorn and watching reruns of
overlapping mannie is your chauffeur and i am
what is she
i am some chick you leave sitting in an apartment
overlapping that is such bullshit
mannie does not feel that way
where is he
why would i know
a cold horror crosses ronna
go revisions salmon he drove you here didnt he
no i got a ride
his car was still in the parking lot when i left
without even closing her register she takes off her apron and heads for the door
go revisions salmon yelling mannie
ronna limps ahead
a taxicab waits in the background
all the alleys look the same
he could be anywhere
a stray black cat scratches through a pile of foam peanuts looking for bugs
another cat crawls up the body of mannie propped against the dumpster
a trickle of water drips off the garbage onto his face
the cat licks it clean
can you hear me
ronna turns to see mannie behind her stretching his neck
his eyes are bloodshot
but otherwise hes fine
you look like shit
the beast is the only car left
ronna and claire circle looking for the keys on the ground
you fucked todd gaines
go revisions salmon no
embarrased we made out
mocking made out
hes a drug dealer
claire doesnt want this to go any further
fortunately just then
she shakes the mud and grime off then throws them to ronna
mannie lies back on the trunk droopy
go revisions salmon unlocking passenger door you might have brain damage from overdosing
starts with x
she puts him in the car holding his head like hes a criminal on cops
ronna hands her the keys over the roof of the beast sunlight shining off the gathered rain
they take a beat just the two of them
so do you have enough money to pay off your rent
and twenty left over
maybe ill open a savings account
claire starts the car
mannie leans up from the back seat
so what are we doing for new years
merry christmas mannie
roars off across the parking lot title music building
go revisions salmon we pan back to the rave hangar heading for it picking up speed
a match cut takes us to
we hear a rave in full swing ahead
the hangar door is open pitch black inside
we fly in bringing us to
go revisions salmon simon awakes to pounding at the front door
he stands and turns disoriented no idea when or where he is
he finally finds a clock its in the afternoon
more pounding at the door
simon half crawls to the window looking out to see whos at the door
from this angle all we can see is the sleeve of a mans jacket
tentatively who is it
he ducks expecting a hail of gunfire
a beat then simon finally drops his panic
he keeps the gun in hand as he pulls the chair away from the doorknob and slowly undoes the lock
he leaves the chain on
looking out through the crack we see gaines alone
undoes chain you wont believe the shit ive been through
without a word gaines grabs him by the collar and smashes him one punch to the face
simon falls in a dazed lump to the floor
we stay down with him as we watch gaines walk away
simon blinks and sniffles as we once again
go revisions salmon adam and zack scrub the miatas upholstery with brushes and various cleaners trying to get the bloodstains out
zack stops for a moment watching adam
adam looks up what
a quiet beat the first moment of genuine affection between them
suddenly we hear a beeping
we cant tell where its coming from
following the sound adam finds a mud encrusted beeper wedged between the seat and the center console
he looks up to zack then checks the number
go revisions salmon note these are wild lines to play underneath scenes a a and a
since these scenes are longer than before we need extra soap opera in the background before we get to adam and zack
somethin about it just didnt add up
so last night i went back to the pier to do some investigating of my own
turns out there are two boats named the princess
only one just got back from two weeks at sea sal dominicos boat
it got me thinkin if chase really did know carmen was on to him how come he didnt tell lucas or gamble or myerson
why would he drive up to pinecliff by himself
and why would you still have his briefcase
beat answer me that danielle
if you have an answer
music rises a scene cut
new music leads into
im not the man youre looking for
we both know you were on the pier
you saw what happened to carmen
dont forget detective
i was cleared of all charges
i dont care how many high priced lawyers you bring in
eden valley will never stand for your kind of scum
