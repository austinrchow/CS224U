written by december draft music up
its a tad eerie
if a zydeco band died in a bus crash this is the kind of music theyd play in heaven
which transforms to a milky white and eventually into a bright high noon sun
a large black bird flies in circles overhead
as it wipes the sun a bright flare causes
to squint then adjust to the light and finally open
they look tired but content maybe even relaxed
the owner of the eyes
though we only see from his shoulders to the top of his head we can tell hes lying in a field
his arm is propped behind his head as a pillow and he appears to be resting comfortably
muffled voices and whispers fill the air but they seem to come from another place
the man doesnt notice them
his name is butch
a gust of wind blows butchs hair a bit and a piece of straw wipes across his forehead
then oddly enough it is followed by a dollar bill which rests against his cheek then skitters across his face
it is followed by another and another a five a ten a single
butch pays no attention
hes in another world
a small country town
normally quiet at this hour the street is tonight alive with trick or treaters dressed as witches goblins and superheroes making their annual door to door rounds
gladys perry going on due to single motherhood and having worked two fulltime minimum wage jobs the past ten years looks out the window with disgust and pulls the curtains
gladys retreats from the sparsly decorated living room to the predictably drab linoleum kitchen
at the table hands on their laps sit her children naomi and ruth twin girls aged and phillip a quiet boy of
gladys sets a casserole on the table and goes to the frig for a container of milk
the children whisper to one another
judy baumer is going as a twirler
but shes so fat
id go as cinderella
or peter pan
peter pans a boy
tinker bells a girl
phillip could go as peter pan
cept you gotta fly
phillip smiles a bit at the notion
phillip could go as a bump on a log
the girls giggle and phillip frowns
why cant we go just once
caus we jus cant ok
gladys sets milk and butter on the table and stares directly at her son
our personal beliefs lift us to a higher place
sides halloween is nothing but the devils work
the doorbell rings
the kids gulp as gladys turns and heads for the door
hughes a year old family man is playing chaperone to prepubescent versions of superman tinkerbell and a dancing in unison trick or treat
gladys simply stares at the children before looking to mr
im sorry but we dont take no part in halloween
phillip arrives at his mothers apron
he stares at the kids with relish
in the near window ruth and naomi steal a look through the window
were jehovahs witness
superman locks eyes with phillip
hey phillip perry
hey billy reeves
howd ya know it was me
go eat your supper phillip
come on kids
lets go to the next house
sorry for the bother
gladys closes the door firmly and locks it
a green impala pulls up to the main entrance and stops
a guard steps from his office to greet the driver larry a pudgy year old prison employee wearing a loud plaid jacket
goin to austin tomorrow
gonna take some work with me
work work work
when you and me gonna go out and grab a cold one
sooner the better
the gate opens and the impala passes
butch haynes a year old inmate who reeks with knowledge procured from the wrong side of the tracks but whose sad tired eyes bemoan a maximum of regret stands on
the top of a cell bunk chipping at the ceiling
jerry pugh rail thin a punk who constantly licks his lips keeps watch at the door
an old timer sits on his bunk and watches both with a cautious eye
butch chips through to something
damn if the old man aint right
jerry smiles turns and grabs the old man by the shirt
and this goes to the roof
afore they walled it over
if it dont im gonna rip your tongue out
get yer damn hands off me
jerry laughs and joins butch who is already well on his way to bending open a slot in a corrugated metal air shaft hidden behind the wall
superman and dancing skeleton no longer with adult super vision fill water balloons at an outdoor water spigot
make em small so you can heave em
an assembly line at the kitchen sink as the twins wash and phillip dries the evening dishes
gladys sits at the kitchen table reading religious pamphlets and keeping a watchful eye over the process
several thuds resound through the house
what in the world
phillip jumps down off his stool and races into the living room
superman lofts a balloon and grabs another as the first hits the door of the perry house and splatters
dancing skeleton does his best warren spahn and tosses a wet fastball at the door
heres your trick
at the window phillip his nose pressed to the pane stares expressionless at the onslaught
he barely flinches as a balloon splats only inches away
gladys arrives and pulls the curtains shut once more
butch kicks the top off a ventilator shaft and rolls onto the roof
jerry follows as butch shimmies to the wall
at the edge butch and jerry survey the yard as a searchlight routinely bathes the walls in a circle of light
parked almost directly below them next to the administration office of the prison
younme must be livin right butchie boy
lets get something straight
i dont like you
as soon as were on our way thats it
who said i liked you
butch slides down and hangs from the ledge before dropping on the roof of the building below
a soft thud causes a guard to look up but only momentarily as he spots larry departing files in hand waving goodbye
have a safe trip now larry
just as larry reaches the impala butch and jerry leap down and land on him
the spotlight showers them in a flash of light as it passes by
butch cups his hand over larrys mouth while jerry reaches into his jacket bingo a shiny
to larry keep yer mouth shut
to larry gawd id love to blow yer head off
larry driving with his eyes straight ahead stops at the gate and waves a palm at the guard who opens without hesitation
stuffed and hidden half on the floor and half under the mats are jerry and butch
a weathered finger drops a quarter in a jukebox
havent heard that one in awhile
the woman mae a dog tired waitress punches in the numbers and returns to her post behind the counter
a lonesome hank williams tune pours forth
not since last night
hows the pie
red garnett a grizzled but handsome texas ranger sits at the counter slowly chewing
it was better yesterday
same pie as yesterday
not much call for rhubarb
sell one slice a day
in the background we hear a siren
red turns and watches a police patrol car whiz past lights on
yer off duty
tell me if i stopped bakin em would you still come by every night
red preoccupied takes another rubbery bite
i dont know
mae smiles and turns her back to red as she cleans the grill
naw red garnett you dont come in here for the coffee and pie

to see me
another patrol car races past
reds eyes follow it
now that ive said that ill go one better
what say i cook you dinner at my place sometime
steaks baked taters cold beer the works
im askin you out
she turns to face red but hes gone
a coupla dollars lie next to the half eaten pie
all she can do is sigh
red pulls up in front of a small house in a residential section of town
police cars are everywhere and several officers are behind their vehicles guns pointed at the house
red steps out of the car and is greeted by a police sergeant about the same age as red
long time no see
what are you doin here chief
red arrives at a truck with a gallon coffee urn roped to the tailgate
he grabs a paper cup and pours
guy holdin his family hostage
she kicked him out served him divorce papers he came back drunk and pulled a
fired two shots but we dont think anybodys hit
actually you might know the guy from your sheriff days

red tastes the coffee cold
he spits it out pours the contents of the cup on the ground and walks toward the front yard
and how are you guys doin
we got specific rules to follow in these kinda situations red
gives in he wont talk
jus keeps yellin crying and waving his gun around
red moves forward into the yard
at least use the megaphone you stubborn jackass
but red ignores and arrives at the front door
hayden this is red garnett
we worked together a few years back
mind if i come in
the yelling inside stops and the door opens a crack
hayden distraught peers out
leave it to the p
they got a three ring circus out there and not one cup of hot coffee
hayden mulls it over then opens the door
on the couch sits haydens wife julie cradling her two kids an infant and an year old boy
her eye and temple are bruised purple
red slowly enters nods to julie takes off his hat and sets it on a lampstand
hayden has moved away from red against the wall
he holds the gun out at no one in particular
julie put a pot of coffee on
she slowly gets up and moves to the kitchen still weeping
jus what is it you want hayden
i want my job
i want my family
whatd they suspend you for
i answer a call in south austin

julie emerges from the kitchen and retakes her seat
you love her

hayden grips the quivering revolver tight and points it at her
red calms the situation
you dont wanna shoot her
i swear to god i think i do
naw hayden i dont think so
i think you love her
you know what else i think
that youd like a way out of this whole mess
thats where i come in
sergeant and other cops stand around and watch the house
well ill be damned
the front door opens and julie emerges with her two kids
she takes a few cautious steps then runs to the police
red sits on the coffee table unloading haydens gun
he opens the cylinder and drops the shells to the floor
a calmer hayden exits the kitchen with reds coffee
red accepts it takes a sip
hits the spot
hayden starts to sob a bit
red hands over a handkerchief which hayden accepts
no cuffs huh chief
hayden nods they stand
red picks up his hat sticks it on his head opens the door and holds it for
hayden transfixed by the multitude of lights outside
well walk out together okay
hayden steps back looks at red then reaches behind his back underneath his shirt and pulls out a
any good officer has a back up
red holds his palms out and takes a step toward hayden
lemme have it hayden
hayden points the gun at red freezing him
was i a good officer chief
was i a good deputy
the kinda man you could depend on to do whats right
then he turns the gun on himself swallows the barrel and blows his brains out
haydens dead covered body is carried out the door
julie screams and sobs still holding her crying children
red looking pretty shook up slowly exits the house
he stops and looks at julie and the kids
his eyes lock with the little boys
got a call chief garnett
theyre lookin for ya downtown
red slowly walks away
the little boys eyes follow him
its a small town version of a kept open by an owner anxious to cash in on the later night munchies of beer drinkers
jerry skims through a girly magazine turning the pages with the gun
butch wearing larrys plaid jacket jimmies open the cash register
he looks to the floor then to
jerry who catches butchs gaze holds it looks down at the floor then smiling looks back to butch
he returns to the skin mag
butch holds his stare at jerry then in one move grabs a wad of cash and hops over the counter and out of the store
jerry notices butch leaving grabs a handful of assorted brachs candies and hurries after
hey wait up
jerrys feet scurry through a pool of blood and past a quivering hand
its very late after midnight and only a handful of people half of whom are cleanup crews shuffle through the offices
a light from an office at the end of the hall catches our eye
a muffled voice over the phone
i understan your concern johnny
red behind a huge ranchstyle desk covered with files and paper sips coffee with one hand works a buffalo nickel through magicians paces with the other and balances the phone
receiver in the crook of his neck
on phone cons are creatures o habit
like old coyotes theyll crawl back into familiar holes
sure yer right
listen you go back to bed and ill call you in the a
with an update
ill have the files by then
say hullo to the mrs
red sighs puts the phone back in the hook and stares at it until it rings again
the clanging wind up alarm clock reads and gladys opens her eyes and gently quiets it with a touch
she groans and rises not happy but used to the daily ritual required of her
as the kitchen light comes on we see that the couch has been opened up to a bed in which all three children sleep
the twins sleep soundly but phillip tosses and turns away from the light
the impala creeps through the previously seen neighborhood without its lights
butch drives while jerry scours the block
theres a buick
dont want a buick
want a ford
fords leak oil
a cars a car
butch puts on the brakes and brings the car to a stop
then take the buick
soon as we cross state line ill do just that
beat im tired of riding around
ill check down the block
for a ford
jerry gets out slams the door lights a cigarette and walks away
butch waits a few seconds quietly turns the key one notch and checks the gas ggauge
it reads almost empty
he taps it with his finger but it doesnt budge
he sighs looks up and sees
as he checks one locked car then feeling eyes on his back turns looks at butch grins and disappears around a corner
butch discreetly exits the car himself carefully closing the door without a sound
gladys steps into a slip and snaps her bra while cracking eggs into a skillet
by rote she salts stirs and pops bread into the toaster
from behind a fence through the opened screened windows we see gladys at work
phillip enters dressed in cotton briefs and a t shirt drags a chair from the kitchen table by the window and assists his mother by buttering the toast
thank you phillip
go wake up your sisters
phillip dutifully steps down and returns to the living room
gladys works to adjust her slip then grabs plates and silverware and takes them to the table
i take mine fried
gladys gasps at jerrys face pressed against the screen but controls herself when he brandishes the pistol
he motions for her to open the back door
he slides into the room and sits down at the table
a ford sits in a driveway
in the far b
a back porch light glares
butch enters frame looks at the light turns to the ford and starts to jimmie the lock
he rises and looks to the light
jerry stuffs a piece of toast in his mouth grins at gladys and makes a motion to the counter
a lil on the bland side
gimme that ketchup
she picks up a bottle of heinz and inches toward him
when she gets close he grabs her and forces her onto his lap
he holds the gun to her throat and whispers in her ear
dont got a man around here do ya
cummings puts on his glasses and peers through the window
gladys sits on jerrys lap thanks to
the convicts hands move freely over the frightened womans body
feed me sweet thing
her shaking hands raise a forkful of eggs to his lips
he licks them once then gobbles with gusto
phillip enters the room and stops dead in his tracks
well lookie here you do got a man
jerry smiles at phillip while he kisses and licks gladys neck
at once phillip darts across the room at jerry who backhands the boy with his gunhand sending phillip sprawling
butch blasts through the door in an instant
with a swift kick to the head jerry is knocked senseless onto the floor against the cabinets
the gun slides across the floor and lands at phillips feet
holding his ear im bleedin
butch gives jerry an icy stare and kneels down to eye level with phillip
butch looks at the gun and then at phillip
whats your name boy
scared shitless ph
well okay phillip
reach down and pick up that pistola
give it to me
to jerry shut yer mouth
to phillip pick it up and bring it over here
phillip reaches down and slowly picks up the gun by the handle
he takes one step toward butch then another
gladys petrified sobs
phillip arrives armslength from butch
now say stick em up
hesitant stick em up
butch laughs and then a noise from outside brings him back to reality
he grabs the gun and spins to see
standing outside the screen door gun leveled
before the old man can utter a syllable butch grabs phillip and points the gun straight at cummings
jerry jumps up and grabs gladys
put the gun down old timer
you couldnt hit me anyway
probably shoot the boy
the phone rings
leave it be
the twins wiping sleep from their eyes wander into the room
its all right honey
phone continues to ring
cummings cant decide what to do with the gun hes pointing at butch
set it on the ground
cummings reluctantly obeys
we gotta get the hell outtahere
phone still rings
in one fluid move he rips the phone from the wall
the silence is deafening
re gladys i vote we bring her with us
how we gonna get outta here without a hostage tell me that
the whole goddam neighborhoods awake
well take the boy
gladys cant believe her ears
jerry tosses gladys aside
she collapses onto the floor
the twins instantly start to cry
phillip winds up and hits butch as hard as he can
butch picks him up directs cummings into the kitchen with the gun and nods for jerry to lead
youll get him back
i swear it
butch carrying phillip and jerry emerge from the back of the house and race back to the impala
butch flips jerry the gun tosses phillip into the passenger seat leaps over the hood and into the drivers seat
the car starts and squeals away
neighbors aroused by the noise exit their homes clad in robes nighties and curlers
jerry fires a shot over their heads sending them to the deck or scurrying for safety
aint you folks ever heard of sleepin in
cummings races from behind the house with the shotgun levels it and fires a blast
a nearby station wagon window shatters
rising from their cover position its owners look at cummings with disgust
nice shootin fred
garnett still in the same clothes rests the phone receiver in his ear while he shuffles through the files before him
reds deputy and boy friday tom adler lank thinning hair with a face as soft as reds is hard warms up reds coffee with a jolt from the chiefs favorite
into phone yes johnny i do understand that
the jabbering on the other end of the phone line continues as reds eyes squint to read the files
the first is jerrys complete with a grinning mug shot in the upper right hand corner
there are several pages in the file but reds fingers quickly peruse the top rap sheet before turning to
its butchs and again reds fingers start to move down the page then they stop and move to the photo of butch at the top of the page
a hint of recognition
the jabbering continues
a little younger than now
a younger con with the grim facade of a man facing hard time
keeps staring at the photo oblivious to the phone conversa tion hes not having
red you there
a whisper red
to adler huh
a whisper hes talkin to ya
have you heard a word ive said
red comes to
into phone yeah johnny
jus thinkin is all
another whisper press has been waiting almost an hour red
red nods then notices someone at the door and motions her in
sally gerber cute in a plain no nonsense way with giant curls accenting her round face in step with the latest hair fashions enters the room closes the door behind
shes nervous as hell but trying to hide it
red motions her to have a seat while he finishes his call
into phone yeah
clear as a bell
red hangs up the phone takes a draw on the coffee mug and looks again at the file
he seems lost in time
whatd he say
the guvner red
red closes the file
reminded me its an election year
red turns his attention to sally
you drink before noon
last one i had was on a liquid diet
remembering penny munroe
i believe you have me confused
im here from huntsville
assigned by governor connally
red is confused
he turns a blank expression to adler
what is this
adler searches the messy desk for something
rings a bell red
believ they sent us something about her this mornin
adler finds the telex message sheet hes looking for and hands it to red
here it is
introducing uh im sally gerber
criminologist with the state prison system
sally offers her hand
red perusing the telex ignores but adler shakes somewhat reluctantly not sure if hes supposed to like her or not
its a relatively new procedure but i was assigned by governor connally
reading from telex to work with state law enforcement officials in all affairs where penal matters coincide with those of the state police
it dont say nuthin about
it includes parole and work release programs as well as penal escape situations
the office phone buzzes
adler picks it up
into phone on our way marge
adler hangs up the phone
gettin antsy red
you scheduled it
adler hangs up grabs reds tie and coat from a brass rung on the wall and hands them over
red puts down the telex stares at sally and reluctantly attempts to make himself presentable
the idea is that an understanding of the particular behavioral case histories should in parole situations help the subject to avoid habitual traps and in penal escape situations could conversely
identify those self same traps as an aide to apprehension
adler stares at sally then turns to red with a never heard the like look of amazement on his face
red roguishly handsome in his tan western cut blazer clip on tie and ten gallon hat makes his way to the door
but before he exits
in the first place miss gerber
in the first place sally it aint a penal escape situation
its a manhunt
fancy words in a circle dont help much
and what does
a nose like a blue tick a medulla with an antenna and one helluva lot of coffee
and with that hes out the door
a throng of photogs and news writers stuff the undersized room
the clamor settles when red enters and steps behind the lectern
listen up ill only say it once
at approximately ten oclock last night two inmates over to huntsville robert butch haynes and jerry david pugh escaped through an air shaft grabbed a prison employees car and got
out through the main gate
at approximately a
we believe they robbed a market outside of cut n shoot and killed the stores owner
is the prison employee with them
was when they left the prison
sally and adler enter the room and stand beside the lectern observing
red notices them
whats the rap sheet on these guys like
long as christmas eve to a kid
haynes was doin for armed robbery and pugh was ridin hisself for manslaughter and assorted parole vios
is there any indication of
lemme finish billy
this mornin another hostage was taken
from a private home in madisonville
a boy age
grabbed him out of bed
any sex offenses on haynes or pugh
yer askin if theyre preverts
well one is
you got inter agency cooperation on this
texas rangers as the criminal investigation arm of the d
share responsibility with the f
due to the kid being taken
but i doubt theyre out of bed yet
a few chuckles
red how do you plan to apprehend the escapees
officially i can only say we have a full manhunt team on their trail and well proceed with due haste
red hesitates a moment somethings bothering him then blurts out
im gonna hunt em like the rabid dogs they are
every hand in the place shoots up and ad lib questions fly like bullets
thats all ive got but id like to introduce ya to miss sally gerber
shes straight from the governors office
knows all about psychological profiles and the like
you probably have some questions for her
red steps back and to one side
sally is taken aback but then warms to the idea and steps to the podium for her first press conference ready to take on the tough questions to show off
a bit but
there are no questions
in fact there is utter silence as every raised hand drops
red sighs and starts to walk away
look fellas i got work to do
and he heads out the door followed by sallys eyes and every reporters in the room who commence once again to yell out questions and mob after the chief
every reporter that is except one
hes near the back of the room and he smiles and raises his hand
sally unsure what to do looks to him
you have a question
yes i do
sally smiles a bit then puts on her serious face awaiting
you doin anything tonight
sally steamed glares at the guy and stomps out of the room
butch is driving with phillip in the front seat beside him still in his underwear
jerry in the backseat leers at butch aims out the window and fires once
an aluminum water tank spews a violent leak
we got a handful of caps and yer shootin water tanks
hes a smart guy huh phillip
phillip doesnt move or change expression
jerry smiles almost to himself and fires twice more for the hell of it
the roof of the impala explodes with two holes as the car speeds off down the highway
red is finishing up with several reporters near the door to the parking lot
adler jumps in holds up his hands
all right thats it boys
chiefs got work to do
red and adler move through the parking lot to saunders an aide to the governor
saunders seconds are a photographer young and energetic and suttle dark haired with a cowlick
saunders shakes reds hand and they turn to gaze upon
parked in the middle of the lot hitched to the back of a new chevy truck
the airstream is painted in state colors and sports banners decals and logos
saunders follows red as he walks around the showpiece occasionally kicking a tire or two
so whattaya think
saunders motions for the photographer to come closer and take pictures
he moves in next to red and poses as the camera clicks
we are very proud of this baby
governor connally special ordered it so state officials and dignitaries can ride in the parade in dallas
you know president kennedys comin
so i hear
latest technology oversized engine complete kitchen and sleeping quarters gun racks frig stove the works
even got a hot line phone straight to the governors office
red stops circling and nods to adler who scurries away
fine piece of machinery
whats more as soon as it gets back from dallas it will be at your requisitioned disposal
perfect for lots of situations a headquarters on wheels
red smiles walks up to one of the lone star decals and rips it off
well take it
red rips off another decal
adler and a few others start to load equipment guns and files into the motor home
in addition they cart out unecessary items mattresses etc
and stack them in a pile outside the motor home
the photographer continues to snap photos
to red whattaya doin red
to photographer stop takin pictures
red does away with the parade banner
saunders follows behind and tries to reinstate the decal
its jus not possible red
the governors gonna ride it in a campaign parade tomorrow
guvner hisself told me this manhunt was top priority
adler moves through the door to the rv carrying reds favorite desk chair
hes followed by bobby lee s cocksure wearing a plain khaki uniform and boots
to saunders scuse me
to red this heres bobby lee
hes a specialist with the feds
they want him to tag along
red stares hard at bobby lee then nods
bobby lee steps into the airstream
please red ya gotta believe me
red spots suttle bright eyed with a cowlick sitting at the wheel of the chevy truck
who are you
dick suttle the driver
bradley glasses moves to the truck and gets in
suttle shrugs and steps out
saunders stops suttle and turns to red
this man stays with the vehicle wherever it goes red
to suttle you know how to operate the gadgets
to suttle grab a seat
suttle sets himself in the passenger seat of the truck
sally emerges from the building ticked off carrying an armload of file boxes and makes a beeline for red
saunders gently touches reds shoulders a final plea
please red im beggin
i mean what am i suppose to tell the governor
sally arrives but before she can spit out a word
tell john that miss gerber here checked me out on it
red whistles and the engine revs
red closes the door as the motor home pulls away
saunders runs beside the passenger side window and yells in to suttle who stares out the window
not a scratch you hear me suttle
not a scratch
saunders stops breathing hard next to sally
shes pissed and overloaded with files
about yards down the way comes to a stop
a second later the door opens and the steps pop out
sally walks toward the bus but when she arrives at the door
laughter filters out of the airstream
the airstream moves another feet then stops
sally waits a full five seconds then she blows the hair out of her eyes and against her better judgment moves cautiously forward the file boxes getting heavier by the
again when she gets close
the airstream moves
sally boiling mad as her coiffure wilts in the texas sun stops and tosses down the file box in anger
the airstream stops
laughter from inside and a few ad libs i
red steps out the door turns his gaze back inside and the laughter and comments stop on a dime
smiling slightly he turns to sally moves straight for the file box picks it up and walks back to the airstream
when he arrives at the steps he turns looks to sally who stews and holds her ground
you comin or not
she hesitates only a moment before walking straight to red grabbing back her file box and entering in front of him
sally enters balancing the boxes and glares at the faces surrounding her
a smiling red a grinning adler messily gorging on a cinnamon roll a nervous kaiser the radio man and in the corner a nasty smirk from bobby lee
when the airstream takes off again she loses her balance and drops one of the boxes
adler and suttle jump forward to help but she gives them the evil eye
ive got it
she kneels down to pick it up and feels eyes on her
she looks up to the men staring at
her skirt raised a bit exposing a thigh
she calmly stands and looks to adler a piece of cinnamon roll dangling on his chin
youve got shit on your face
red cant help but smile as adler wipes at his face
the impala blasts along kicking up dust and dispersing crows as it heads into a one light township
it slows however before the main part of town and slides to a stop near a pay phone booth
why the hell we stoppin
you said you had a cousin near here
so give him a call
see if we can shack there til things cool down
jerry thinks it over leans forward and in one quick swipe grabs the keys from the ignition
then he laughs and crawls out on his way to the phone booth
in the b
we see jerry strut to the phone booth and pore through a thin directory
phillip steals a glance at butch who watches his rear view mirror and grits his teeth
whyd he take the keys
so i wont leave him
a tad hopeful would you leave him
in the b
jerry rips the page phone book in half and returns to the car half pleased with himself
he tosses the keys to butch who starts the car and drives off
prolly couldnt have heard em anyway
goddam ears still bleedin
you ever try that shit again
you were in the middle of threatenin me
from the movies aint a threat
its a fact
butch reaches over takes phillips hand and places it on the steering wheel
here kid take the wheel
phillip scared at the prospect nevertheless does his best to see over the dash and keep the wheel straight
butch turns back over the seat to confront jerry
in two seconds im gonna break your nose
thats a threat
before jerry has time to snicker butch hits him full in the face and grabs the gun
blood spurts from jerrys nose and the injured man cups his hands over the wound
butch spins and retakes the wheel from a frightened phillip
and thats a fact
instead of expressing outrage jerry slinks back down in the seat wearing a look of pure hatred
im gonna kill you for that
and thats a threat
beginnin to understand the difference
somethin catches butchs eye and he turns and slows down and turns into
the impala brakes to a dusty stop near the front of the store which is bordered by a giant hay field
okay phillip listen up
im gonna run in here and get some smokes
butch hands phillip the revolver
here hold it like this
and point it right between his eyes
what the hell
to phillip if he so much as moves you pull the trigger right here
put your finger on it
jerry snickers and then laughs maniacally
butch reaches over and cocks the pistol
jerrys guffaws stop on a dime
yer a fuckin crazy man
and thats a fact
i believe yer gettin the hang of this
butch steps out of the car and heads for the market
a short fat man with a fishing cap is sweeping up
wheres yer sodees
hot in the first aisle
cold in the back in the cooler
phillips slightly shaking hands hold the pistol pointed directly at jerrys head
you ever shot a gun before boy
phillip steals a glance at the store anxious for butch to return
itll knock you on your ass
be quiet mister
you aint never shot no gun before
livin in a house with three split tails
no daddy around
youll prolly grow up queer you know that
a bead of sweat rolls down phillips cheek
now im gonna lean up here real slow okay
so we can talk
jerry raises his hands palms up and slowly leans forward in the back seat
phillips hand quivers but he doesnt pull the trigger
there we go
now we can have a man to man
you are a man aint ya
butch dumps a six pack of rc colas a handful of moon pies a handful of beef jerky and some gum on the counter
jerrys chin is on the front seat now and his arms are draped over it
those are cute little underwears you got there boy
say does your mama sew yer name in em initials or anything
jerrys hand slowly reaches down to the white briefs
he places one finger in the front elastic waistband and slowly pulls it open
whatcha got in there
jerry sneaks a peek
kinda puny aint it
phillip diverted looks down
in a flash jerry grabs the gun
the hand is quicker than the eye
jerry flicks open the revolver spins it empty slots
re butch that sonofabitch
hells bells no shells
the old man puts down his broom and ambles to the register
this be all for ya
this and a carton of chesterfields
beat are those
gimme a box
the old man puts the cigs and shells on the counter and starts to tally the bill on a notepad
with deposit comes to four dollars eighty
butch reaches in his pocket and extracts the wad stolen from the convenience store
the old man takes note
butch selects a five and places it on the counter
what line of work you in
the old man bags the goods but butch takes the shells and puts them in his coat pocket
buy em fix em up
sold a cadillac down in madisonville this mornin
jerry puts his gun hand around phillips neck and pulls the sobbing boy closer
jerry rests his face on phillips neck
come over a little closer
as jerry groans phillip seizes the moment and bites jerry hard on the ear
jerry screams and drops the gun which phillip picks up and carries with him as he scurries out of the car and into the hay field
jerry in pain now with both ears bleeding crawls out of the back seat and gives chase
phillip still sobbing runs for his life in the hay which is a full foot taller than he
no longer stumbling now grinning maniacally gives chase whistling as if calling for a lost puppy
im gonna find you boy
you best come here
gun in hand stumbles falls gets up keeps running
he falls again and crawls to a stop
he wipes his tears and balls up on the ground trying to make himself invisible
butch exits with a grocery sack
when he sees the car doors open he dumps the groceries in the front seat and looks to the field
the hay rustles as jerry moves through the field
jerry crouching moves through the field eyes peeled for any sign of phillip
phillip lies still
he hears the hay rustling near him and he looks up squares his body and points the revolver at
butch who spots him motions for him to stay put and holds out his hand for the gun
phillip hands it over and watches while butch reaches into the plaid jacket pocket extracts a few shells and loads the
a little frustrated now but still moving forward
a whisper hey boy
you better hope i dont find ya
he spots something a dash of color and begins to crawl faster
he parts a thick batch of hay and looks up into the gun barrel and eyes of
squatted down who levels the revolver and closes one eye
whatcha gonna do
hit me with it
butch reaches into the coat pocket with his free hand and shows a shell or two
jerrys grin drops
pleading men you are friends
thick as theives
hears a gunshot and runs for his life back toward the store
phillip runs to the car and hides behind the tire opposite the store and field
in the b
we see butch emerge from the field and walk toward the car
the old man who also heard the shot emerges from the store with a baseball bat
butch arrives at the car spots the old man and levels the revolver at him
phillip is relieved when he hears butchs voice instead of jerrys
to old man you got a phone
then go inside and lie down til were gone
the old man meekly does so
butch goes to the car door opens it and motions to a frozen stiff phillip
the truck and airstream barrel down the highway
the place is a functioning mobile headquarters now
adler on the short wave and tacking up a map bobby lee still in his corner red and sally sitting across from one another at the kitchen table
in the rear section of the airstream reds chair and a mini office for the chief have been put together
got a spot on em
a store right outside of benhur
about miles from here
adler sets down the mike sticks a tack on the map and stands back
push the roadblock on north by miles
kaiser calls in the instructions
note kaisers radio transmissions are not scripted but go on a lot of the time were in the airstream
in addition his and adlers direc tions and missives to bradley in the truck are not all scripted
ya figger theyre that far along
hell i dunnoand neither do they
theyre jus happy to be out
its a high speed sunday drive to them
i like that
never heard you use that one before red
sally is watching red and listening to all of this with a troubled look on her face
somethin eatin at you
perhaps premature but do you have an auxiliary roadblock plan for when they split up
no one ever questions red
what makes you so sure they wont stay together
you got somethin to say spit it out
their situation is one of accommodation
they wont be together long
haynes and pugh are opposites
haynes is a criminals criminal armed robbery mano y mano confrontation
pugh on the other hand has a rap sheet littered with molestation and petty crime
theyll split sheets soon
still on attack what about the hostages
they gonna flip a coin to see who gets to keep who
red rises and walks to the sink
he rinses a spoon
its happened before
either way its a dilemma theyll address soon
beat thats why we should address it now
she looks to red
he refuses to return her gaze
we dont have a dilemma
and neither do they
theyll keep one hostage
and get rid of one if they havent already
if theres a snafu whos john q
public more likely to give a rats ass about an innocent boy or a goddam bureaucrat
red wipes the water off the spoon on his shirt and walks to his office in the back
adler bobby lee and kaiser chuckle lightly at their bosss snubbing of the female upstart in their midst
sallys face glows a bright red
red sits in his office chair pulls out the spoon and pours geritol from a bottle into his coffee
he doesnt even look up when sally enters a stern look on her face
we need to talk chief garnett
call me red
beat why are you so hell bent on embarassing me
im hell bent on one thing
you hang around long enough youll find that out
til then a tough backside and a sense of humor will get you through a lot
i have a fine sense of humor but the one thing i wont do is be your straight man so you can play hero to a bunch of morons who
think youre some kind of hillbilly sherlock holmes
red sips from the mug calmly then groans his face contorted
arthur godfrey says it keeps ya young but im not sure its worth it
id like an answer
this yer first time out of an office
she refuses to answer
whatd ya expect ya signed on for
adler bobby lee and kaiser all watch the discussion smiles on their faces
sally abruptly closes the door
you think im what
some dumb schoolgirl who wandered into the boys locker room
well youre wrong
i dont mean to boast but i happen to be one of the two most intelligent people involved in this fiasco
didnt ask that
asked what you expected
i expected to be allowed to do the job assigned to me by the governor
i happen to like the governor hunt quail together every year
but deep down he and i know that win lose or draw this is my ship not his
the governor as chief executive officer of this state bears ultimate responsibility for
responsibility lies with the one that loses sleep the one with the most ulcers
this mess turns bloody and it might all its gonna cost the governor is a few votes
me im the one thats
red catches himself about to get too personal
he takes another swig of his coffee geritol
sally softens her stance
youre the one that what
but red side steps
tell ya what
you think im makin a wrong turn you speak up
might not agree but ill listen
as far as stepped on toes and wounded pride ill buy everyone a drink when we head for home
i got more to worry about
beat that sound fair to you
well okay then
sally turns about to leave
so whos the other one
if yer one brain whos the other
he was tested in prison
butch drives and catches an occasional glance at phillip who sits quietly but who too steals looks at his captor between swigs of rc cola
he finishes off the bottle
butch reaches in the sack for another pops the top on the dashboard and hands it to phillip
beat are you gonna shoot me
men you are friends
butch realizes that in phillips eyes he and jerry were probably friends
if i was choosin a runnin buddy id take you over him any day of the week
the rv slides to a stop in the gravel parking lot which is full of state and local police
red exits first followed by the others
a local sheriff walks up to greet
we got a positive i
yessir with only the boy as hostage
but not five minutes ago we found something else
pan from a fingertip up an arm and to the face of jerry pugh
a clean bullethole has left him with a third eye a bloody back and an entourage of late summer flies
we hear the click of a photographers camera
boom up to red local sheriff and other bystanders
least now we know whos in charge
butch notices that phillip is pretty somber as he tugs on another rc
whattaya thinkin about
if i guess you tell me
you thinkin about yer mama
phillip sits still
that was it
butch brings the car to a stop
he points to the horizon
i hear ya phillip but look around
i cant very well leave you here can i
the impala rests in the fork of a dirt road
lemme ask you somethin
you right or left handed
phillip meekly holds up his right hand
the car races forward
then thats the way well go
you ever ridden in a time machine before
phillip shakes his head
sure you have
whattaya think this is
yer lookin at this thing bassackwards
this is a th century time machine
im the captain and youre the navigator
butch points forward through the dash
thats the future
butch taps on the rearview mirror
thats the past
if lifes moving too slow and you wanna project yerself into the future you step here on the gas
he does so and the impala surges forward
and if yer enjoyin the moment yer in well hell just step on the brake here and you can slow it down
butch brings the car to a complete and dusty stop
this is the present phillip
enjoy it while it lasts
then he laughs uproariously and steps on the gas
the impala spins out kicking dirt in all directions
time travelin through texas
we got to find us a ford
my daddy always drove fords you know that
the airstream sits in the parking lot of the store
bradley and suttle sit up front in the truck
bradley turns the knob on an intercom speaker system next to the radio
its an intercom speaker system
you can get and give instructions to and from the rear of the vehicle
hows it work
you push the power button but if youve got the volume turned up
bradley pushes the power button
the system squawks loudly and then creaks tinnily
youll blow the speakers
red cringes his ears still ringing from the squawk and turns to stare at the front of the rv
quiet to suttle this things prolly got a warranty
you oughta make a list of all the things that are wrong
red shakes his head and stands in front of the map placing thumbtacks at crossroads indicated by the circle mark
that oughta put his pecker in a sling huh red
remembers sally sorry maam
ignoring adler shouldnt these be roadblocked as well
she points to several other unmarked roads
sooner or later hell get on a main road
we dont got the manpower to roadblock every farm to market
in a perfect world miss gerber wed lock arms and thrash the bush til he turned up
in a perfect world things like this wouldnt happen in the first place
adler hears something on his headset turns to red
locals are heading out
lets sit tight
hell turn up
the impala travels slowly along the road until it edges to a stop by the entrance to a small farmhouse with a truck and car parked in a long dirt
a farmer on a combine works a small field
ok phillip were gonna do some car shoppin
you ever play cowboys n injuns
see that ford sedan
now i want you to sneak on over there like an injun and take a peek and see if the keys is in it
dont have to if you dont wanna
but id appreciate it
you bein the new navigator and all
phillip thinks it over then opens the door and slips out
hey phillip check for a radio too
phillip still in his skivvies legs cut up and muddied from his escape from jerry sneaks up to the car and quietly peers into the open window
the keys dangle when his small hand touches them
phillip closes the door looks around and then runs pell mell to the passenger window of the impala
its got keys and a radio
phillip holds his crotch and stamps his feet
can we stop at a fillin station
this heres nature phillip
pee in the ditch
phillip scrambles to the ditch to relieve himself while butch steps out of the impala tosses the keys into the field and walks toward the ford
the farmer stops his tractor and notices butch and phillip
phillip despite his prior urgency is having trouble coaxing relief
butch slides into the ford pumps the gas pedal and turns the key
the engine grumbles and dies
the farmer is walking now slowly and then at a trot as he realizes whats happening
phillip finally starts to pee
butch cranks again and again but the ford is flooded
start you sonofabitch
the farmer runs faster comes closer
hey thats my car
butch floors the gas to clear the flood and the engine finally starts
he throws it into reverse and peels out backwards into the road beside the ditch where phillip continues to relieve himself
get in the car phillip
the farmer only yards or so away is racing toward them madder than a wet hen
phillip tries to hurry but the rc continues to run through him
get in the car
phillip pulls his underwear up and races to the car
he leaps into the open passenger door at the same moment butch steps on the gas and the farmer arrives and grabs onto the door as it closes
the car is screeching down the road but the farmer holds on for dear life and auto
he claws at phillip who does his best to fend off flailing hands and fingers
butch reaches under the seat for and grasps the pistol
phillip sees whats about to happen and bites the farmers hand as hard as he can
the farmer releases his grip on the door and falls backward summersaulting into the adjacent ditch
butch places the gun back under the seat
goddam boy how many rcs did you drink anyway
butch shakes his head and laughs
one things for sure
you got one helluva set of chompers
bradley tries to light a cigarette with the lighter but gets no heat
to suttle lighter dont work
put that on the list
bobby lee sits alone in the back corner of the main room of the rv
he just sits and stares occasionally smiling cynically at sally
adler takes the latest info off the radio while the others listen in
into radio highway north
four miles south of desdemona
to red stole a vehicle
kaiser radios up front the engine starts and the airstream moves
to adler what kinda shapes it in
the ford he stole
owner told the locals they only drove it to church but it does have a bad emergency brake
to sally howd ya know it was a ford
he likes fords
adler looks at the map
looks like you was right red
hes off the farm to market and onto a spur
whattaya wanna do
beef up the i roadblock
adler gets more news through the headsets
beat red the locals wanna know if theyre to take a clean shot if they get one
red stares out the window for what seems like an eternity
adler looks quizzically at red and pulls off the headphones
come back mobile one
adler are you there
tell em what i said
into mike uh
was that a negative
no er yes
no means negative
red sees sally peering at him over the top of her file
he glances around at the other sets of eyes
i dont want some half ass sergeant york taking pot shots with a deer rifle
adler puts the headphones back on
bobby lee smirks a bit
its the only thing to do
hes got the child with him
red gives her a look that says dont defend me
to sally i suppose you figger hell jus give up
maybe maybe not
well now theres a safe bet
ill give you a safe bet
the boys in better hands now than he was
the third eye pughs sportin on the way to the morgue shouts otherwise
sally flashes red a look back
bobby lee rises and moves past red on his way to the toilet
casually then why not shoot to kill
red just stares at bobby lee as the younger man moves slowly past him to the toilet
adler on the radio
to red theyve forwarded the stolen vehicle license to the roadblocks
you still wanna go to the farm
red pulls out a package of red man chewing tobacco and mulls over the question while he slaps a wad into his cheek
i gotta hunch
you got blue eyes dontcha phillip
never met a blue eyed phillip before
who you named after
you and your old man get along all right
toss the ball around play grab ass in the yard that sorta thing

he aint around really
well he is or he aint
whens the last time you saw him

the both of us got blue eyes we both like rc cola and neither one of us has an old man worth a damn
a bit defensive my mama says hell prolly come back
prolly when im ten or so
shes lyin to ya pure and simple
he aint never comin back
disappointment registers on the boys face
guys like us phillip we gotta be on our own
seek foolish destiny that sorta thing
the ford pulls off the dusty road and into the lone pump in this dilapidated petrol mirage
a buck tooth boy in overalls steps to the window
what can i do ya for
to phillip tell him your name
fill er up it is
the attendant starts to pump the gas
all you gotta do is say your name and people are waiting on you hand and foot
like a goddam king or somethin
phillip cant help but smile at the notion
bradley and suttle lean against the parked rv chatting
you responsible for engine maintenance on this thing
im the full time driver
bradley shakes his head
you notice how it keeps wanting to slip a bit goin into second
feels to me like somebodys been a little heavy footed with the clutch
beat id take care of that if i was you
pan to an ambulance door opens and the farmer strapped in is rolled toward it as his wife sobbing attends to him
several local police scour the surrounding field walking four feet apart looking for what they hope they wont find
red leans on the trunk of the impala chews and spits on the ground
he sniffs the air
adler strides up from the field
no bodies this time thank gawd
you got the keys to this thing
get me a crowbar
to sally you might wanna wait in the boat
no thank you
but its black as night
a crowbar cranks at the lock until the trunk blasts open like a bottletop
a blast of light gives way to the silhouetted faces of red adler and sally who turns and walks away in nauseous disgust
in it lies the crumpled bent bloody remains of larry the prison employee the original hostage
theres our bureaucrat
spits a chaw turns and walks to the rv
near the entrance sally is heaving
to no one in particular its sure nice to know the boys in good hands
sally straightens herself ready to bite back but reds face is soft
he offers a handkerchief
she takes it
gallows humor sally
without it wed all be heavin
the ford slides down the main street and into a side alley next to a department store
you ready to get out of those skivvies and into some britches
well all right then
but first we gotta come up with some a
s fake identities ya know
names to call each other when were around other folks
beat go ahead and think one up
whatever name you want
phillip is amused by the sport of it all
any name i want
a small time dry goods store with a sign over the entrance proclaiming friendlys the friendliest store in texas
a small well organized country dry goods store with a dozen or so aisles carrying everything from ddt to used boots
a long counter at the front of the store is backed by a small office with a large glass window that gives the manager mr
willits bespectacled anal retentive a clear view of the store
a nuclear family with two kids exits the store just as butch and phillip enter
butch holds the door open and smiles at them
they say thanks but cant help but notice phillip cowering behind butch still clad in his underwear
he hides behind a nearby display which reads cast your vote for friendlys friendliest clerk
a clerk lucy holding a handful of shoeboxes notices their entrance
shes schoolmarmish with a smile that looks like its painted on
well hello there and welcome to friendlys
looks like the little fella needs some pants
as a matter of fact
shoes and new skivvies too
hell tell you his size
go with the lady buzz
phillip still in somewhat of a daze doesnt recognize his own name
phillip snaps to cracks a smile at butch and follows the lady to the childrens section of the store
buzz what a cute name
like a bee
walks past the cash register gives the clerk behind the desk a wink and proceeds to an aisle which features hardware rope tape nails etc
he stoops and grabs a shank
with his hands he grips the rope tight and jerks it taut
lucy is holding jeans up to phillips waist
itd be easier if i knew your size but well get it right
phillips eye catches something
on a circular rack with shelves
hanging prominantly is a casper the friendly ghost costume
above it a sign reads marked down get the jump on next year
mesmerized by the display
takes a roll of electricians tape
he tears off a strip attaches it to the back or his hand and tugs
it holds tight
kneeling looking for sizes selects a pair and turns to find phillip gone
she spins around and smiles when she sees
wearing the casper mask
its a friendly ghost
not very scary but youll have a whole year to work on it if your daddy lets you have it
good price too
whatd you go as this year
a local police car cruises slowly spots the ford parked in the alley and comes to a halt
the cop terrance who only started last month after he flunked out of texas a m checks the plates against a notepad on his dash
realizing his find aw
butch with a handful of supplies including the rope and tape makes his way to the register
hes greeted there by paula to whom he earlier winked
shes country cute and wears a fake smile that rivals lucys
butch reaches for and tries on a pair of sunglasses
he adds them to the pile of stuff
will that be all for you today
butch nods and hands over the goods
you folks are about the grinninest bunch i ever seen
paula laughs then drops her grin looks behind her to see mr
willits is watching and whispers
old man willits holds a contest ever month
the friendliest clerk gets a bonus
beat theres a ballot box at the front
willits adjusts his black and white tv and settles on a local news broadcast
on tv the hunt continues for butch haynes who escaped last night from the maximum security unit over in huntsville
haynes six one pounds with brown hair is considered armed and dangerous
he was last seen
paula checks butchs items as lucy and phillip emerge from an aisle and drop a pair of jeans and sneakers onto the counter
heres the clothes but buzz has his heart set on a halloween costume for next year
it is half off
pays more attention to butch as the newscast continues
haynes is believed to have an year old boy with him as hostage
each checking out the other
to phillip well get it next time
go get in the car son
terrance pulls his black and white to one end of main street and parks it across the street blocking it
into radio okay pete im all set down here
pete probably terrances uncle slides his black and white to the opposite end of the street and puts it in park
into radio copasetic
lets just keep him tied up til the state boys get here
adler takes the urgent message off the radio and turns to the group
theyve got him penned down in noodle north of abilene
paula bags the items including the jeans
staring straight at butch
shakes his head at willits dont even think about it
walks toward the front door but stops short when he sees once again the halloween display
pays paula then stuffs a in her blouse
you are truly the friendliest clerk i ever met
she blushes a thank you as butch makes a hasty retreat to the door
an afterthought thank you for shopping friendlys
butch exits the store spots the blackandwhites and slides into the middle of a group of old timers moving down the sidewalk at a leisurely pace
phillip stands at the costume display looks around then grabs a casper costume carton stuffs it under his t shirt and walks quickly to the door
butch slides away from the old timers and into the ford
butch checks the back seat
no phillip no buzz
he checks the rear view mirror and sees
pete his cherry top spinning pulls in behind butch blocking his entrance to the main street
butch throws the ford into reverse and steps on the gas
pete not expecxting this kind of pace at least not from the get go leaps into his back seat
the ford rams into the black and white pushing it backward into a lightpole and a truck
the trucks owner carrying mulch from the feed store watches as his truck slides toward him
phillip steps out the door
he spots the crash and watches as
the ford blasts back into the alley in a hail of dust
butch driving like a maniac turns into the back alley and steps on it
all at once he mashes on the brakes and comes to a squealing stop
the alley is a dead end
butch rips the car into reverse and squeals all the way back to the original side alley
phillip stands frozen scared not knowing what to do but keeping a look out on the street for the ford
lucy and paula peer from behind the counter at phillip and the fracas taking place in the street
i knew something was wrong from the get go
they spot phillip standing a few feet in front of the door
look he left his little boy
and look the little rascal has
hes no better than
hes got that casper costume
he stole it
the ford emerges from the side alley once more and squeals onto main street
cant believe his eyes
is coming straight for him hell bent on destruction and picking up speed
terrance sticks his black and white in rapid reverse and backs down the street at mph
on radio get the hell outta there
we cant lose both vehicles
is gaining on him he can actually see butchs grimaced face when suddenly it goes into a dusty fishtail does a and barrels in the opposite direction
antsy as hell stuck wondering how this whole thing is going to play out
hes suddenly aware of the peering eyes behind him
lucy bangs on the glass
you little shit
shoplifting is a crime
checks his mirror looks ahead spots phillip and blasts straight for the front door of the store
he skids to a halt and stares right at phillip
up to you buzz
hes frozen for a second his knees knocking teeth chattering the works
lucy appears behind him and the glass door
to phillip youll never get away with this little mister
phillip dashes to the ford and makes a swimmers starting dive into the open passenger window
butch pulls his gun and fires once into the glass door above the clerks heads
the glass door and surrounding windows shatter into a million pieces sending lucy paula makeup pantyhose grins and all into a heap on the floor
the ford squeals out down the street
pete crawls out from behind the seat and ducks again just as
the ford sideswipes the black and white for good measure and fishtails out of town
pete crawls over the back seat again as his radio squawks
paula emerges from behind the counter and stares at lucy on the ground amidst glass and mayhem
say what you want
im keepin the twenty
two young country boys stand by the side of the road
one frank tosses an egg from hand to hand while he watches the horizon
the other billy approaches crawling through a barb wire fence dragging something behind him
sure enough a hail of dust signals the approach of a vehicle a mile or so away
billy crawls into the ditch next to frank
we see what hes dragged from the field a scarecrow with a floppy hat and red bandana
stick it in the road
billy does so propping the scarecrow into a sitting position with a forked stick
then he races back to the ditch and slides in next to frank to divide the eggs
we got seven eggs
i get four to throw and you get three
since it was my idea
here they come
aim for windows and get ready to run
the car crests the hill followed by another and another and a final one all highway patrol all with their lights on and oh shit
the cars dont even slow at the sight of the scarecrow blast ing right through it sending hay hat limbs and all flying
the scarecrow or whats left of it lands in a ditch next to the boys
in unison they breathe a sigh of relief look at each other drop the eggs and hightail it for home
the car is parked in a field of some sort
butch reaches in the back seat for the bag of clothing
here take them nasty skivvies off and put on yer jeans
he spots phillips not so successful effort to hide the costume box
whatya got there
a ghost suit
from the store
you kyped it
phillip nods expecting the worst
well hell phillip put it on
you aint mad
lets unnerstan each other here
stealins wrong ok
but if theres somethin you need bad and you aint got the money then its okay to take a loaner on the item
its what ya call an exception to the rule
phillip tears into the box rips out the costume looks at it starts to take off his underwear then balks
butch notices phillips hands covering his crotch
you dont wanna get undressed is that it
you embarrassed caus i might see yer pecker
well hell lemme see
phillip still hesitates
ill shoot ya straight
phillip gingerly pulls off his underwear
butch smiles a broad grin
hell no phillip its good size for a boy yer age
phillip remasculated smiles and starts to put on the costume
here they come
the four highway patrol vehicles from before blast past at sending stray dogs and roadrunners scurrying for cover
crane down to reveal the ford off the same roadside but behind a burm in a field
as soon as the patrol cars pass butch starts up the engine and humps it to the road and off in the opposite direction
sally deep in her files
she looks up from the file to
bobby lee who sits by himself whittling away at a stick and leering at her
adler is at the map holding the shortwave mike and wearing the earphones
behind him red stares out the window
haynes bought tape rope and some clothes for the boy
red comes to and turns to adler
sally smiles almost to her self
she was right haynes is looking after the boy
everyone knows it but no one says anything
one puzzler though
they say the boy could have gotten away but didnt
probably scared to death
thats not all
the kid stole a halloween outfit
holy jeezus theyre a team
with the pit stop in noodle looks like hes headed for the panhandle
red sighs and groans
unpleasant news but somehow he knew it
he moves to the back room for another shot of geritol
to red what
theres more roads than people in the panhandle
hows that happen
over his shoulder poor counties
they tend to half finish roads then start on another one
but if anybody knows them backroads its red
sally lifts her head watches red reenter the room then stares out the window
im robert haynes
called butch by everyone
i was born in amarillo but grew up in the french quarter of new orleans
sotto voce whats she doin red
i killed a man when i was eight
nobody seems willing to play along
red turns from the window to sally
howd ya kill him
shot him with a pistol
there was always one around the dance hall
thats what they called it but it was a whorehouse
we lived there
red moves away from the discussion and stands at the front of the airstream staring out the front window
whatd the authorities do
the victim was wanted by the locals so the whole thing got shoved under the carpet cajun style
they didnt even stick him in juvy
put me in school
three years behind but i catch up
sounds like things are goin okay now
when im twelve mom dies
delilah jane haynes hung herself in the bathroom of the brothel
could have saved herself the trouble

phillip now fully attired in his casper outfit and mask is looking at a folded map while butch drives
an inch is miles
hold yer pointin finger along the line of the road
you got three lines on your finger dontcha
each ones an inch
so how many inches to childress
phillip holds one finger to the map then another
yer a helluva navigator phillip
a lot smarter than jerry
but i guess thats not sayin a lot
something catches phillips eye
coming toward them on the highway
bradley driving tinkers with a broken windowshade
suttle yawns comes to notices the broken windowshade and gives bradley a look
bradley caught just smiles
excited too seen one of them in a magazine
its called a motor home
kinda like a house on wheels
butch honks the horn twice and waits for a retort
bradley smiles looks to suttle who nods an okay
johnson sits on the horn for two solid blasts
phillip laughs and waves
bradley and suttle wave back
staring out the window
she looks at the passing ford
butch is hard to make out but theres no mistaking the casper outfit phillip wears with pride
you said the boy stole a halloween costume
i believe it was casper
casper the friendly ghost
that was them
they just passed us
turn this thing around
adler jumps on the radio to the truck
into mike turn it around
that was them
the airstream slows to a grind pulls off the narrow shoulder and begins to make a wide u turn
well never make it
its a close fit but the airstream just survives a brush with a burm
the truck peels away with airstream in tow
butch checks his rear view mirror and gets a puzzled look on his face
the airstream barreling fast behind catching up
bradley presses the pedal to the floor
the engine strains
suttle nervously sneaks a peek at the speedometer
its not safe to go over with this much load
the speedometer reaches
the engine screams
the whole thing is shaking twisting bumping
all aboard try and keep their balance
to adler tell him to pull up next to em
bobby lee opens a window and leans out
as bobby lee leans out the window of the airstream some yards back
phillip turns around backward in the seat to watch
theyre goin fast
phillip you get in the back seat and lie down on the floor
hell i dont know
caus i said so
suttle is scared to death while bradley is loving every minute
the engine starts to steam
yer burnin up the engine
but bradley pays no heed
bobby lee unholsters his pistol and leans back out the window
red spots him
holster that firearm and get yer ass back inside
bobby lee thinks it over shakes his head in disgust and holsters his piece
butch spots an opening and
hold on phillip
the ford makes a sharp veer off the road into a flat scrub brush field
the car spins out a bit when it hits the dirt sending forth a dust devil then it regains its traction and blasts ahead through the dust
bradley spots the maneuver and starts to follow
the truck in an attempt to enter the field misses the flat spot hits a burm with its front right tire and flies into the air
the trailer hitch snaps as does the safety chain
the truck lands hard and continues pell mell through the field
the airstream sans truck blasts forward along the road at m
bouncing like hell
sally holds on for dear life then glances out the window and almost jumps out of her seat when she sees
the truck or so yards away blasting through the field toward the horizon
red spots the same but before he can cuss
the airstream veers off the road and into the rocky field
trees scrub brush and boulders are no deterrent for the sleek silverfish which seems to be moving even faster than before
steam smoke pouring from the engine
suttle covering his eyes sneaks a peek behind and screams when he sees no airstream behind them
bradley looks in the rear view mirror turns around and screams too
without visual guidance
the truck blasts into a mesquite tree runs halfway up the tree then dies a horrible death
its an anti gravity room what with the files coffee maps and bodies flying around
the airstream now losing a bit of steam hits a burm almost topples and comes to a precarious stop in a dried up watering hole
adler still wearing the headphones rises first and goes to the radio to answer an incoming call
sally crawls to her feet and offers red a helping hand which he accepts
they wanna know if the boy looked okay
he was laughing and waving
dont tell em that
a large group of very serious advisors sit and stand in a circle around the governors desk
across from governor connally sits a nervous near tears gladys perry
an aide on the telephone turns to the governor
they say the boy looked a okay
governor connally nods sighs and reaches hand across the desk and touches gladyss shoulder
hell be fine mrs
this whole nightmare will be over and done with very soon and youll be home with your boy
gladys distraught nods
governor connally discreetly nods to a photographer in the group while keeping his hand on gladyss shoulder
a cameras flash causes everyone to blink in reaction
the governor shakes it off and continues
i want you to know that i personally okayed the use of a brand new high tech mobile home from which to conduct the manhunt
its an amazingly futuristic piece of law enforcement equipment
thru thru the airstream the amazingly futuristic piece of law enforcement equipment sits beat to hell and leaning to one side in the dry pond bed
all the tires are flat and dents and bruises abound
the door tries to open but is stuck
red applies a boot to it and the whole thing comes off its hinges and flies to the ground
he groans and shakes his head when he spots
bradley and suttle limping toward him across the field
red sighs and starts slowly walking in the direction butch and phillip headed
sally her hair a birds nest does her best to collect her files before she sits down takes a deep breath and glances out the window at red in the
standing in the middle of the field staring at the horizon
he sticks a chaw in his mouth without diverting or blinking his eyes
staring at the horizon
butch sits on the hood of the ford which is stopped on an asphalt road which a few feet farther turns into dirt and a few feet farther a dirt
started this road years ago and it still aint finished
beat appears to me we got a decision to make
phillip aka casper exits the car and imitating butch leans against the car
its up to you phillip
we can backtrack to the highway or we can try it on foot
where we goin
butch reaches in his back pocket and pulls out a folded postcard
he hands it over to phillip
its at least years old crumpled
it unfolds to reveal a beautiful green valley with a snow capped mountain behind it
its alaska phillip
last of the wild frontier
you been there
just got the one postcard
but anyhoo back to our present dilemma
you feel like a hike
cant be moren oh say fifteen hundred miles
phillip seems a tad apprehensive about the prospect
yer prolly right
go give our supplies a check
phillip returns to the car and emerges with the paper bag once full of soda candy and jerky
butch surveys the countryside
typical midwest texas flat dusty barren
a mile or so away sits a home a small ranchhouse
phillip returns with the bag and pores through it
hows it look
half a moon pie
rations for one at best
butch strides straight into the rocky field
phillip lingers a moment then sticks the half eaten moon pie in his mouth and follows hurrying to catch up
thru thru suttle limps around the broken down silver junker his hands covering what his eyes cant bear to see
now yer sure that gooseneck had a safety chain
suttle turns and glares
red walks slowly toward the slumping airstream
a phone rings from inside then stops
adler sticks his head out of the door and calls to red
governors hot line red
governor insists that he have the mobile home back for the parade tomorrow
red just stares at adler then sighs removes his hat and scratches his head
isnt it obvious
tell em to come and get it
butch continues his hell bent brisk pace in the field of dirt clods
its all phillip can do to keep up
where we goin
were goin trick r treatin phillip
phillip stops dead in his tracks
butch sensing that the boy is no longer following stops spins and faces phillip
we aint allowed to trick r treat
my mama dont allow it
trick r treatin
against our religion
against yer religion
what kind of foolishness is that
butch picks up a dirt clod and hurls it as far as he can
he sighs and turns to phillip
now im askin you phillip
i aint askin yer mother and i aint askin jehovah
do you wanna go trick r treatin or not
butch and phillip cross the dirt yard and make their way to the door
ok phillip all ya gotta do is knock on the door and when they open it you say trick or treat
they arrive at the door
butch nods at phillip who rings the now wait til they come
a farm wife or so like something from a grant wood only smiling opens the door and looks out on the pair through the screen door
whispers now phillip
trick r treat
well aint you the cutest lil ghost i ever did see
whispers say it again phillip
trick r treat maam
well seein that halloween was yesterday i guess youll have to trick me
you missed the caramel popcorn balls i made up special
butch smiles pulls up his shirt and exposes the revolver stuck in his pants
tune changed wait right here
butch smiles and pats phillip on the shoulder
his eyes are drawn to
which enters the house near the door
we pan with the telephone line from the house to a nearby pole
the woman returns with an armload of anything she could find in the kitchen
phillip gratefully opens his sack and watches as the woman drops in a loaf of bread a jar of mustard candies jams butter and anything else she could find
empty handed she reaches inside the door opens her purse and dumps her money a couple of dollars and lots of change into the bag
phillip sack in hand waves goodbye to the frightened old woman who shuts her door and locks it
butch and phillip make their way back across the yard
never underestimate the kindness of the common man phillip
butch reaches up and grabs the phone line yanks it loose and tosses it aside
the airstream is fast becoming a pig sty
coke bottles coffee spills overfull ashtrays etc
adler holds the mike and stares at the thumbtacked map
into mike spur northbound
and at aspermont coming and going
to red that it
adler moves to set down the mike and topples a cup of coffee
it spills on the floor
suttle grabs a towel to wipe it up but realizing the futility of keeping the airstream clean he simply throws it aside
butch drives while phillip digs through the sack and comes up with a jar of mustard
you sure theres no meat in there
spam maybe vienna sausages anything like that
well i bet you can make us some mustard sandwiches cant ya
well go to it
phillip breaks out the loaf of bread and lays out four slices on the dashboard
many as you want
phillip lays out six more slices
the dashboard is now covered with bread
phillip pulls out the mustard but has no knife
butch pulls out a stick of gum and hands it to phillip to spread with
as they drive along they pass a large happy family mom dad girl boy picnicking in the dip of a long hill alongside the highway
from the look of their brand new loaded down station wagon they are on vacation
mesmerized by the family
he pulls his eyes back to the road notices something
butch brings the car to a stop near the crest of the hill sets the emergency brake grabs the first completed mustard sandwich and gets out leaving the impala running
be right back
dont be stingy with that mustard now
phillip nods and continues piling the yellow goop on each of the slices of bread
walks ahead to the crest of the hill the tallest hill in the county
he takes in the degree view
his eyes settle on
idling as they wait their turn to pass a roadblock at the bottom of the hill
spreading even more mustard
every so often he sneaks a peek back at the picnicing family
slips a little then gives all at once
starts to roll backwards
turns and sees the ford rolling backwards picking up steam back down the hill
step on the brake
put your foot on the brake
the middle one
panicked slides over and grabs the wheel
of course he is too short to press on the brake and when he bends down
swerves off the road and onto the shoulder
headed by bob their ward cleaverish father looks up to see
barrelling backwards toward them swerving to and fro and followed by butch shouting instructions
makes a beeline for the station wagon
forget the car bob
are you crazy
its only got a miles on it
he jumps in the drivers seat of the wagon and frantically revs it just as
gains control of the wheel and steers the rapidly reversing ford around the wagon
continues backwards to the bottom of the hill but it has enough steam built up to head backwards up the other incline of the previous hill
comes to a heaving halt next to bob who is near heart attack himself
that was close
bob gets out of the station wagon and stands next to butch
they watch for the ford for a second see that its losing momentum and smile at each other
breathes a sigh of relief as the ford loses momentum and comes to a stop
but then of course
like any car on a roller coaster starts to move downhill slowly at first but then picking up speed
had me scared silly
ive only had her two months
shes a beaut all right
say bob what with my brake problem and all i sure would appreciate a lift
men my boy live about five miles up the road here
i can pick up the car tomorrow
they notice the ford coming back down the hill and squint to see
coming straight for them gaining speed with casper the friendly ghost behind the wheel
chuck the small
bob looks for a place to hide
screaming at the top of his lungs
staring straight ahead at phillip
butch doesnt even flinch standing his ground in the middle of the road staring straight into phillips oncoming face
the brake phillip
step on the brake
totally freaked jumps down on the floorboard and pushes with both hands on the brake
squealing tires bring
to a skidding halt inches from butchs kneecaps
smiles at phillip
helluva job phillip
never had a doubt
crawls down from the luggage rack on top of his wagon and smiles a sigh of relief
two highway patrol officers check licenses and peek into cars at the checkpoint
in the b
we see the red station wagon in line
its full to the brim with the family bob plus two butch and phillip who ride in the back with bobs son
as the car approaches the roadblock butch grabs a blanket reclines and hides behind a stuffed animal
sorry for the inconvenience edgar
the kids like the back down like that so they can play
no trouble at all bob
bob brings his precious car to a gingerly stop
he pulls out his license shows it
why the roadblock officer
escaped convict sir
just a precaution
bradley examines the gooseneck hitch
bobby lee sits on a nearby rock still whittling at his stick
its starting to resemble something
as in the old westerns its quiet too quiet
the inside of the rv is pretty much trashed now the product of men working in close contact
sally stares at a file
the silence is broken as red spits tobacco juice into an empty coke bottle
sally peruses a file
its butchs again
shes reading an addendum page with juvenile court record stamped at the top
a photo of year old butch is stapled in the corner
sally finds something very interesting
she looks up at red
he returns her stare
bobby lee finishes his whittling blows away shavings smiles at his creation sets it on the rock gets up and walks away
a four inch long wooden replica of a high caliber shell
adler is getting something on the shortwave
to red theyve got two highway patrol cars they can give to us now
tell em stand by
we got the best seat in the house right here
have the southern roadblocks call in the dogs and move north
check every road every farm from san angelo to sweetwater
adler surveys the map and sticks in a few more thumbtacks
he knows hes hemmed in
i predict well have him singing a different tune by nightfall
the red station wagon creeps along the highway to the whistled strains of old macdonald had a farm
butch truly singing a different tune whistles old macdonald
bob joins in and soon the whole damn family bob is whistling the tune
bobs daughter patsy red hair freckles starts jumping up and down on the back seat singing and spilling her drink
bob and his wife immediately turn around
look at what youre doing
bobs wife grabs patsy by the arm and shakes her
butch con tinues to whistle softly almost eerily but hes watching closely
look at what you did
its all over the seat of your fathers new car
the little girl starts to cry while bob grabs at tissues feverishly and hands them to his wife who leaning over the seat is wiping hard at the stain
she grabs her daughters arm and shakes her staring into her face
butch directly behind the little girl watches closely
what is wrong with you
i told you twice not to jump up and down
patsy bawls harder than ever
bobs wife finishes wiping and reseats herself in the front seat
to herself damn that kid
the little girl is crying harder than ever now
bob reaches back over the seat and tries to touch his daughter
its okay sweetie
daddys not mad
so much for the new car smell
the little girl muffles her tears
butch smiles sincerely then looks to the passing landscape
this will do fine right here bob
but i do have one more favor to ask
the entire family bob is standing along the roadside their luggage and belongings by their side
the looks on their faces say it all stranded
butch hands over the stuffed animal to patsy pats bob jr
on the head and sticks out his hand to bob
just a loaner bob
not to worry
youll get her back
bob reluctantly shakes butchs hand in an attempt to impress upon butch his most important concern of all
please its new
hold it under
at least for the next miles
you know i will bob
butch gives a snappy salute and is off to the wagon
butch starts the car and he and phillip slowly pull away
phillip does so
bobs kids wave back
phillip starts to giggle
they look funny
maybe but bob did the right thing
what if hed put up a fight
i mighta had to shoot him and where would that family be then
naw bobs a fine family man and thats about the best thing a fella can hope to be
butch floors the wagon and the car screeches rubber on the highway
cringes as he watches his pride and joy rocket toward the horizon
the highway patrol continues to monitor cars one by one
one of the officers sees something and nudges his partner to look at
cresting the hill carrying their hats in their hands along with their luggage and coolers
adler drops his headphones and turns to red
he got through
coerced a motorist
well goddam shout at amarillo
tell em we got a notion hes headed their way
adler gets right to it
almost to himself truth is i wish hed cross the border so we could turn this over to the feds
nobody in the room expected to hear this
i got work to do back home
red rises and stretches walks to the open door and stares out at the late afternoon light
this thing got any food
adler jumps up and goes to the frig
got t bones in the frig red
uh uh those were stocked for the governor
i dont think that he would approve of
adler finds a plastic bag in the freezer and inspects it
and look red
those kind you like
red turns and looks
butch fiddles with the radio
he settles on a spanish station playing a ballad and adjusts the volume
cant find a coonass waltz to save my ass
beat hey phillip that stuff you told me bout not trick r treatin causa jehovah
was you pullin my leg
what else aint you suppose to do
we dont get christmas
yer shittin me

you aint never been to a carnival neither have ya
not even one
not even one
seen that once
never ate none though
you know phillip you have a goddammed red white and blue american right to eat cotton candy and ride roller coasters
pull back to reveal
still screaming in glee the wind blowing his crew cut straight up into the air
pull back farther to reveal that phillip is firmly tied to the luggage rack of the station wagon which is rocketing across the winding plains of west texas
boom down to reveal butch having almost as much fun as phillip hooping and hollering as he steps on the gas and weaves to and fro trying his damndest to
hit every bump
a nehi orange sun pours itself into the grape ade davis mountains
pan along the horizon past nothing but open spaces then a red neon sign small and broken down like the spit grill diner it advertises
the stolen station wagon sits alone beside the pressed dirt parking lot of dotties cafe
a skinny small town waitress checks her face in a bathroom mirror
she applies too much lipstick and pinches her cheeks before exiting
we follow as she exits the kitchen bathroom door grabs two already prepared hamburger platter specials from beside the grill and moves through a swinging door into the diner
a counter three booths grease everywhere
she sets the two plates in front of butch and phillip at a booth
butch digs in but phillip holds for a beat
butch notices and stops chewing while phillip says grace
quiet as a mouse thankyew father for yer boundiful nature and goodness
butch and the waitress cook share a smile
now dig in buzz
to waitress call him that caus he eats like a buzzard
if its dead hell swoop and chow
she leans down to the table and flirts with her overdone eyes
her son runs the place but
he aint never here
he leaves at four
not much traffic after lunch
she brazenly stares a hole through butch as she lifts a slice of pickle off his plate places it in her mouth and slowly chews
phillip mouth full takes note of the confusing spectacle
eileen turns to walk away
if you need me ill be right over here
she slowly sashays away to behind the counter
butch watches her every step
phillip chews and watches butchs eyes
butch turns his head and catches phillip watching him
eat yer food
a sirloin steak hits a grill beside a tater tot shiskabob and sizzles to beat the band
a homemade barbecue pit built from nearby abundant rocks sits square in the middle of the highway with red flares set up just in case a car did come by
red smiles and shakes a liberal dose of lea and perrins onto the flesh
hes obviously a veteran of many back yard b bqs and this is definitely one
we see sally through the window
shes inside still going over her files
she gets up and walks into the back room to look for something
sitting outside rises and slides into the airstream while red continues to cook with adler and bradley looking on
sally turns on a nightlight and looks at herself in the mirror
she splashes a little water on her face and is startled when
bobby lee slides in behind her
think yer pretty smart now dontcha
she doesnt back down instead looking him straight in the eye
well yer not smart but you are pretty
sally stares right at bobby lee then moves for the door
he shifts his position and blocks her
bobby lee smiles a crooked tooth grin refusing to move
work and pleasure should naturally go together dont you think
take me i enjoy my work
i could give a shit
you got a mouth dont ya
how you take your steak sally
bobby lee and sally both look up to see red standing in the doorway
a woman after my own heart
she takes this opportunity to slide between red and bobby lee on her way into the main room
as she goes
ill just wipe its ass herd it through and you can cut off a hunk
howd that be
maybe medium rare
bobby lee and red are left standing face to face
i dont give a damn who you work for
youre here for one reason and one reason only
anything else chief
yer in my office
the hot line phone rings
bobby lee flinches first and moves back into the main room
thats the governors line red
red calmly walks past sally who smiles a thanks
he gives her a one finger to the hat salute walks to the phone reaches down and yanks out the cord
the ringing stops
nuthin as impolite as callin at the dinner hour
phillip at the booth plays with the parsley on his empty plate which sits across from butchs barely touched one
the boy looks over his shoulder and sneaks a peek at butch who sits at a barstool watching eileen work behind the counter
butch leans over and whispers something sexy into eileens ear
she giggles and licks her lips
butch feels eyes on his back and looks at phillip who immediately turns away from them
when butch returns his attention to eileen shes moved a few feet away and is refilling ketchup bottles
buzz go ahead and chew on mine if you want
eileen slides back down toward butch
she makes refilling condiment bottles the sexiest pasttime since the hula hoop
i try hard but ya know since his mama died
my mamas not dead
butch a tad annoyed turns to phillip and gives him a look
once again when he turns back eileen has moved
shes flirting with butch moving bending wiping her hands on her hips
his eyes are focused on her every squirm
over his shoulder okay now buzz you go on out in the parking lot and chunk some rocks or something
phillip reluctantly slides down off the stool and slowly walks out the door
his eyes stay on butch and eileen barely concealing confusion mixed with a hint of jealousy
so is she dead or not
covering badly well his biological mother is alive
gave him up for adoption to me and my wife
my dead wife that is
she is was phil er buzzs stepmother so shes his mom was his mom stepmom but
im so sorry
but shes not
in fact it seems to have turned her on even more
she puts her hand behind butchs neck and slowly pulls him close for gentle kiss
phillip tosses a rock then turns to the diner
phillip drops his handful of rocks and walks to the front window of the diner
it is empty
he sees that the kitchen swinging door is still swinging on its hinges
a one room addition office built onto the kitchen
it has a desk against one wall a few chairs a fan pretty sparse
two large windows throw light from the outside neon sign onto the room
a large lamp provides harsh light
eileen leads butch by the hand into the room closing the door behind them
at once they are all over each other
butch lifts her up onto the desk and starts to kiss her face and neck
then in an instant he flips her over pulls the ribbon from her hair and unzips the back of her waitress outfit to the waist
he kisses her neck her back and suddenly passionately he flips up her skirt and begins kissing her voluptuous backside
phillip a bit scared moves around the side of the front of the diner and sees something
in profile butch continues to kiss eileens buttocks
she moans in ecstasy
phillip like a pacifist at a prizefight doesnt want to watch but cant not watch
he moves down the wall to a window positioned right at the desk
when he stops hes right in front of the window separated from butch and eileen by only a foot of air and a thin plate of glass
kissing writhing but from this angle all he can really see is a mane of hair swinging to and fro
butch is out of sight but its obvious that his lips continue to caress eileens backside
she cranes her neck arching it like a swan moaning like a wildebeast and then
she stops and stares straight ahead
butch continues to kiss but only for a beat sensing the locomotive hes on has stopped at an unscheduled station
he slides his face from around her rear a la kilroy and he stares too
except for their continuing heavy breathing they could be modern art statues staring straight ahead at
phillips nose is pressed to the glass
in fact if he pressed any harder there wouldnt be any glass
hold their pose for a second until
comes back to real time and bolts away into the darkness of the parking lot
nosy little feller
races to the side window and watches as phillip runs into the parking lot
a last try i keep a cot in the back
but butch still at the window just keeps breathing
nothing but stars swimming in black west texas crude
stands right next to the sputtering neon sign staring straight up the neon light splashing his face in a grotesque pink light
in the b
over his shoulder the cafe door opens clanging a string of bells as butch hastily exits and walks past phillip
get in the car
butch drives away libidinous desires phillip sits quietly staring straight ahead now and again stealing a peek at butch
you mad at me
you kissed her huh
much regret jus barely
caus it feels good
aint you ever seen your mama kiss a man
beat you kissed her backside huh
its well uh its kinda hard to explain
i know how it musta looked
beat hell i dont know how it looked
as butchs voice trails off silence overtakes the car
after a few seconds butch seems happy not to have to answer any more questions
phillip fidgits with the door handle
several more seconds pass then
do you love her
the lady that cooked the hamburgers
butch ponders this then a grin slides across his face
yeah phillip i love her
beat kissed her butt didnt i
and they both start to laugh
the station wagon pulls off the main dirt road and onto a smaller private road
after yards or so it leaves the graded dirt and shocks bouncing crosses into a plowed field and comes to a dusty stop
you wanna drive
jus kiddin buzz
im just gonna stop here for awhile and catch
butch kills the engine but keeps the radio music on low
things go our way well be in alaska in four or five days
get the jump on winter
phillip looks a little sad
i wanna go home
if you wanted to go home so bad why didnt you stay at that store today
caus i stole

butch chuckles at the notion
well get you home soon
i swear okay
i can drive

theres lots and lots of stuff you can do phillip
gets an idea reach in that glovebox there
see if bobs got a notepad or something
phillip extracts a small ringed memo pad
good old bob
can you write
i can print
now i want you to make a list of everything you ever wanted to do but wasnt allowed to
hell i dont know
its yer list
butch settles in for a catnap
just as his eyes close
only the dome light and the low music bring attention to the car sitting lonely in the middle of the massive field
how ya spell rocketship
the aftermath of a full scale texas bar b q plates full of gristle and bone cigarettes burning in ashtrays and swirl ing in half drunk bottles of coke and
mugs of coffee men groaning and picking their teeth with toothpicks
bradley adler and suttle are dead ass asleep and snoring
bobby lee too mean to sleep sits by himself cleaning his fingernails with a pocket knife
red leans against the airstream and sips coffee from his thermos
sally walks up sipping from a mug and leans against the bumper
red doesnt even turn
figger to give em another hour of shuteye then grab the patrol cars and head for the panhandle
bring back any memories
red turns to her
they both know hes divulged something

red uncorks his thermos and refills sallys mug
she takes a sip and almost chokes on it
red gives her a strong look

what about probation
the boy had a home a father
whats your file say about him
that he was a petty thief who did a little time got out and stayed pretty clean
there are murderers id trust with my mother and petty thieves i wouldnt turn my back on
your precious files are wrong
haynes old man was a career criminal with a soft spot for whores
one way or the other he beat the hell outta every person he ever crossed screwed or fathered
judge sends junior home with the old man and you can bet your last dollar that within a year hell have a rap sheet as long as yer arm

hell ones even a priest
sally realizes shes opened an old wound
still i dont understand from the file why
this job aint about files and books and second guessin
ya get one shot and ya call em like you see em
im a bit confused
red tosses out the rest of his coffee
in texas the bottom line is who ya know and what they owe ya
thats how i do my job and how you got yours
he turns to walk inside
a bit ticked what are you trying to say
red stops faces sally
i bought the judge a t bone and told him to send the boy up
told him it was the right thing to do
he went along right down the line
sally just stares after him her face once again soft
resting on phillips lap
his fingers release it as he drifts to sleep
asleep the way a child sleeps
also asleep but only his body his mind works over time
note the entire dream is a series of snapshots to a strong coonass beat a a baby snapshot of butch
b a haynes family photo a grizzled father standing behind a mother seated holding a baby

y extreme closeup butchs moms face
as opposed to the others her face is rather displaced
youd think shed witnessed a fender bender instead of a murder
z extreme closeup the face of the victim
its the tattooed man
aa extreme closeup the tattoo
the roar of the machine growl is now deafening as the image of the tattoo
that fills the frame
except its brighter than the brightest day as a high power light shines directly at
who exits his dream and enters reality with a throttled shock
he squints and tries to discern the source of the light while groping for his gun under the seat
its bright as hell but getting clearer less fuzzy
we can now see its the headlights of a huge combine which sits engine running directly in front of the station wagon
a black man or so kills the engine but leaves the lights on steps down from the combine cab and starts toward the station wagon
phillip now wide awake and scared
he notices that
butch is fingering the gun resting it in his hands and under his right leg
the black man whose name is mack crosses the front of the wagon and walks to the drivers side window
didnt mean to scare ya

a highway patrol car followed by a tow truck breeze along the highway
two officers montgomery and hall scan the horizon
they look like theyve driven all night
saunders wakes up in the back seat and leans forward
we didnt pass it did we
saunders spots the rv on the horizon
there it is
the patrol car stops as does the tow truck
hall and montgomery view the beat to hell rv while saunders ready to cry jumps out and runs into the field
good gawd almighty
governor aint gonna like this
suttle is asleep among the rubble
he jumps to when saunders bursts in
saunders gasps when he sees the shape his prize vehicle is in
where are they

i dont know uh four five hours
saunders dejected starts to move some of the trash from the couch
he sits down and moans
well goddammit did he say anything
well uh chief garnett wanted me to tell you that the vehicle gets his seal of approval
saunders face begins to turn red
and that he wants his chair back
if he was red before now saunders is crimson
a ther mometer dropped into boiling water
we hear a scream and then a second later reds desk chair comes flying out the door
it hits a rock and splits as it bounces
two highway patrol cars rocket along one behind the other
officer jones a lean hard nose of drives
adler in the front seat red and sally in the back
not a word is spoken
another officer drives this car
kaiser rides shotgun working the radio
in the back seat sit bobby lee and bradley
a coffeepot rattles on the stove
two black hands move the pot and rescue overfried eggs in a skillet on the stove
two small black feet dangle from a too high bathroom toilet
as they hit the ground we hear a flush
we follow the feet down down a short hall and into the living room
as they pass the bottom of a fold out couch we
boom up to reveal butch and phillip asleep
butchs arm has found its way under phillips head and is acting as an early morning pillow
a small head pops up on the side of the bed nearest phillip
the six year old eyes of cleveland peer close to phillip and watch only inches away as phillip sleeps
phillips eyes blink a bit and then they open
more scared aaaayyyy
butch jumps up like a rocket and is on the floor in an instant
cleve races into the kitchen and the apron strings of his grandmother macks wife lottie
he wake yall up

butch and phillip both look up at mack
boy dont got the sense gawd gave a chicken

lets head on over towards amarillo
well cross him there or wave goodbye at the border
phillip sits on the couch and watches as butch shows cleve a trick
cleve bends over puts his hands between his legs and butch grabs them and pulls a flip
cleve is ecstatic at the result
phillip and butch laugh along
do it agin
to butch wheres the boys mother

butch spots an old phonograph
say lookie here
he gives it a spin with his finger and searches through a stack of s

butch finds a particular favorite
now this is music
you know how long its been since i heard this
thats an oldie all right
andrews maiden name was bougeois half creole herself she is but mr
andrews he dont like nobody to know
suppose thats why he give em to us
mack drops his pants and sits on the throne
he reaches over and turns on the radio resting on the wash basin
a farm report comes on just as
a needle drops on a filling the room with the scratchy sounds of a coonass waltz
butchs eyes come to life
you dance lottie
lawd goodness no
here jus follow me
he takes her in his arms and slowly but surely adjusts her movement to his
after a few rough turns theyre not too bad
phillip cant help but smile as he and cleve watch and giggle
butch and lottie dance swirling around the room
poe you sure can move
oughta be able to
was raised in a dime a dance whorehouse
yer foolin me
my mama would dance their asses out of the fryin pan and into the back room fire
butch spots phillip and cleve watching giggling
get on yer feet buzz
youn cleve shake a leg
encouraging well go on
cleve and phillip reluctantly stand and stare at one another
the little boys do their best to emulate the adults and soon theyre laughing and dancing too
the record stops
they all clap and laugh
butch hears something
the radio in the bathroom
mack sits cleaning his fingernails with a barlow knife as the radio announcer begins a news flash
update on the manhunt for the escaped convict
haynes is armed and extremely dangerous
he is believed to have a hostage with him an eight year old boy
a finger turns off the radio
we follow the finger up an arm to butchs concerned face
he sits down on the edge of the tub across from mack and takes the knife away from him
well be leavin soon enough
ill kill all of you if you try anything stupid
mack swallows hard
lottie quizzes phillip
whats texarkana like
i aint never been there
through his teeth oh its real nice
i got a dog named
phillip and a tree house and
mack nervous enters the room followed by butch
come on buzz
time for us to hit the road

cleve runs up to butch turns around backwards and puts his hands between his legs
do me agin
scared for the boy no
get over by yer mammaw
lottie senses something is wrong
cleve too young to smell trouble persists
come on mister do me agin
butch smiles and starts to oblige the boy but mack inter venes and smacks cleve hard sending him sprawling to the floor bawling
butch instantly enraged back hands mack grabs him by the collar and tosses him onto the floor
phillip frozen sitting watching as things go from bad to worse
cleve confused bawling afraid
butch pulls the gun from his pants bends down picks up mack by his throat presses the gun in his mouth and lifts him into a chair beside lottie
he bends close to mack their noses are inches apart
whyd ya wanna go and hit cleve for
he didnt move fast enough for ya is that it
or maybe he gets excited sometimes and dont hear everything ya say
you make me sick to my stomach
butch spits in macks face then rises and walks over to phillip and hands him the revolver
point it at em
i dont wanna
phillip does so occasionally wiping a tear from his eye
mack reaches down and holds lotties hand
butch kneels down to a still sobbing cleve
now son you wanna flip
cleve shakes his head no between sobs
butch gently takes the boy and lifts him to a standing position
put yer hands between yer legs
i wont hurt ya
cleve turns to mack and then runs to him
butch walks calmly over and pulls the crying child away from the old man and back to the center of the room
to mack he dont trust ya no more
you gotta earn that ya know
to cleve put yer hands tween yer legs son
cleve still sobbing does so
butch reaches down and flips him all the while staring at mack
each time he flips the boy butch reaches down grabs cleves hands and flips him again
finally he allows the frightened child to go to mack and lottie
butch takes the gun from phillip
go out to the car and get that rope
phillip stands frozen
phillip slowly rises and walks away
he stops for a moment and turns his back
his eyes lock in a gaze with
his sobbing eyes plead for something anything
phillip exits the house walks past an old well to the station wagon
he opens the door stops looks back
butch sits on the coffee table across from mack lottie and cleve
to mack now you hold that boy and tell him you love him
mack grabs cleve and sets him in his lap
scared i love you
butch cocks the revolver and slides forward
his nose is almost touching macks
no old man
say it like you mean it
this boy know i loves him mistah
then say it
i gotta sense about you
i know you a good man
nome i aint a good man
aint the worst neither jus a different breed
phillip is at the screen door looking in
he holds the bag in his hand
butch sits on the coffee table which is pushed right up to mack lottie and cleve who sit on chairs
butch enthralled with the episode hes directing almost quivers with anticipation
say it mack
dont cost nuthin
i love you cleve
serious gawd thats beautiful
butch spots phillip standing at the entrance to the living room with the bag
he takes it from the boy empties the contents candy cookies bread sugar and all and picks up the rope takes macks barlow knife from his pocket and cuts off
a long shank
butch takes the rope and begins to tie up the three
phillip stands stares aware that something bad is happening
butch finishes tying sticks the knife in his pocket and walks over to the phonograph
he turns it back on
the scratchy record plays
he turns up the volume
to phillip you can go wait in the car or you can watch
yer old enough to think for yerself
phillip unsure what to do stands his ground
butch returns to his seat on the coffee table and stares at the three hostages
he appears as if hes about to cry closes his eyes and rests his chin on the barrel of the revolver while he recites instructions
shut yer eyes cleve
mack you and lottie hold the boy tight
shut yer eyes too
phillip awkwardly aware that hes going to witness an execution starts to cry out then squelches himself
butch seems to be in another world now taken to another place and time
a slight smile finds its way to his face then disappears
please mistah aint no use in it
well give you everthing we got
but butch doesnt even hear the words
he slowly opens his eyes pulls his chin from the pistol barrel and points it at mack
our father which are in heaven hallo be thy name
to lottie shhh
thy kingdom come lawd thy will be done
here on earth as it is in heaven
to mack cleve say it wif me
butch looks to phillip in a strange way sets the gun on the floor between them and crawls amongst the candy gum and wrappers until he finds the electricians tape
phillip watches not knowing what to do
the revolver cocked resting on the floor
giv us this day our daily bread and forgiv us lawd our trespasses as we forgiv those who tresspass agin us
butch rips tape from the roll and slaps a piece over each of their mouths silencing their prayers one by one
out of breath he kneels down in front of them and stares at the three while he reaches his hand behind him for the pistol but its not there
butch looks up to see
phillip teeth gritted holding the pistol pointing it directly at butch
his expression is blank then a slight smile
for a second its as if none of this has happened that butch will grasp phillip in his arms
a deafening gunblast turns his expression to blank
phillip knocked to the floor by the revolvers kick recovers to his knees shaking like a leaf
the mambo record comes to an end but scratches on ad butch falls back to his knees still staring at phillip
he looks at his stomach where a stain of brown red gushes through his t shirt and back to the boy
as if he hasnt seen him in years phillip
phillip momentarily dazed stares at the gun in his hand at butch the blood pouring from butchs side and the shocked faces of mack and his family
then in a flash he runs pell mell out of the house
phillip blasts out the screen door and runs straight to the well
he drops the gun into the well catches his breath and heads for the road
after a few yards he has a thought runs back to the station wagon grabs the keys and throws them as far into the adjacent field as he can
then he resumes his race for the road
butch gropes to his feet still in shock
he stumbles toward the door then stops reaches in his pocket extracts macks barlow knife holds it up and walks toward them staring hard
mack cleve lottie afraid theyll be killed after all
butch surprisingly meekly sets the knife down on the coffee table
thanks for yer hospitality
and walks away
butch emerges and stumbles out
to the horizon phillip
he drags himself to the station wagon and with much effort slides himself into the seat
he opens the door crawls out leaving a trail of blood looks out to the road and starts to walk
runs down the road looking back every so often to see if butch is following
makes his way onto the private dirt and starts walking back toward the main road
i wont hurt ya i swear
is running out of steam on the road ahead
he stops for a blow and looks back
a few hundred yards back butch struggles forward
phillip crawls through the ditch beside the road and squeezes through a barb wire fence
his costume hangs on a barb
he rips away from the fence leaving a foot long strand behind
in the b
a pickup truck drives by
arch andrews the owner of the ranch slows down when he sees
what the hell
clad in his white costume running across a field toward a grove of trees beside the creek
arch continues on down the road and passes
butch nearly in shock stumbling down the road
pulls into macks place and arch gets out peers into the station wagon sees blood grimaces and walks up to the house
he notices a dripping trail of blood on the porch
arch enters the kitchen sees no one and starts toward the living room
the mambo continues to scratch
arch enters the living room and stops when he sees mack and family still gagged and tied to the chairs
butch holding his side the pain is worse as he stumbles along
he stops when he spots something a piece of white costume on the fence
he crosses the ditch steps through the fence and walks in the same direction phillip did
that was a helluva thing to do phillip
youre a hero
prolly be in all the papers tomorrow how you saved those folks
truth is i dont think i woulda killed em
i only killed two people in my whole life
one hurt my mama and one hurt you
adler listens in on the shortwave
a town called happy over in swisher county
to jones how far
half hour tops
to adler get on the radio and tell whoever gets there first to play it nice and easy
sally gives him a look
theyve got the boys mother flyin in on a private
you want her on standby
jeezus who did that
guvner i assume
not a bad idea
go ahead and chopper her in
after a moment of silence sally turns to red
i didnt mean to pry last night
yes ya did
look red it was years ago
when the judge sent him away the kid stared at me
like he knew
not hard or mad like youd expect
it was like he was forgiving me
forgiving you for what
for looking at the facts and doing what you thought was right
for whats gonna happen today
butch follows phillips path through the field
what say we talk this over
settle things man to man
then we can be on our way
ill even let you drive
knock that right off yer list
howd that be
finally arrives at the creek looking over his shoulder all the way
he looks at the water deep and running swift
where to go
he decides and heads for the nearest tree a big oak and shimmies up to a branch ten feet or so above the ground
a country cop answering the report drives slowly down the road his pistol drawn and held upright in one hand
he pulls into macks driveway and parks
arch walks out of the house to greet him
thats his car
took off on foot
hes got a pistol
mack says it looks like a
butch stops to rest
something catches his eye
a white figure moves slightly in the boughs of an oak tree
phillip tries to climb higher but cant reach the next limb
butch walks underneath the tree without even looking at phillip
he sits down to rest
wild and wooley
man against nature
me personally i like them odds
beat did i tell you my daddy lives there
hes the one that sent the picture postcard
listen here to what he says about it
butch pulls the postcard from his back pocket and reads
reading dear robert
thats my real name phillip
jus like old bob the family man
dear robert i just wanted to tell you that me leaving has nothing to do with you
phillip still afraid cant help but listen as butch suffers through his memories
reading alaska is a beautiful place
colder than hell most all the time
someday you can come and visit and well maybe get to know each other better
short and sweet
thats the old mans style
cold all the time like thats a big sellin point
he laughs to himself
he useta pat me on the head and tell folks that its some that can live life without askin about it and its others has to know why and this
boy here is one of the latters
beat thats why i wanted to go up there
to visit the old man i guess
prolly punch him one first but then maybe wed end up bein friends sit down have a beer talk things over
he pulls his hand from his side
blood is oozing all over the place
he returns the postcard to his pocket
well jus rest awhile
then you can make up yer mind
phillip still clinging to the tree cant help but feel compassion for his friend
a dozen highway patrol cars now sit in the driveway
the fed in charge agent hendricks assigns different officers to secure the area in an incredibly organized fashion
mack lottie cleve and arch watch from the porch
butchs eyes are closed
a small puddle of blood drips and becomes a rivulet running down into the creek
phillip still in the tree still watching cant bear it any longer
he slowly climbs down and drops next to butch who opens his eyes to the boy and smiles
one things for sure now i definitely believe in ghosts
beat never been shot before
i know ya are
truth is if it had to happen im glad it was you
as opposed to someone i dont know i mean
all things considered i feel pretty good though
could use a beer though
whats beer taste like
oh its about the best thing there is
youd better put that on the list
phillips eye catches something
he stands up fearfully
lights spinning rushing down the road kicking up dust
sally watches red
when the car comes to a stop she reaches out and touches his arm
i think our chances of this thing ending peacefully are good
he smiles a lonesome smile opens the door and exits
phillip kneels back down to butch
you better run
naw phillip i need me a time machine with a loud radio to take me where im goin
walkins for squares
red exits his patrol car followed by sally
agent hendricks walks up

phillip scoops a handful of water and brings it to butch who opens his mouth and drinks a megaphoned voice interrupts
through megaphone butch this is red garnett of the texas state police
a thin knowing smile crosses butchs lips

phillip betrayed beyond comprehension stares at butch
to phillip dont look at me like that
i dont even have a gun

red mulls it over replaces his old chaw with a fresh one and looks to sally

bobby lee approaches with a leather case bypasses red and goes straight to hendricks

bobby lee nods

a helicopter circles preparing to land

phillip still cranes his neck to see
now that ya got yerself a ghost suit do ya think shell let ya trick r treat

bobby lee carefully unsnaps the latches on his leather case and opens it on the hood of the patrol car
a high powered military rifle in three parts
hands unzip a velvetine bag and pull out a high powered scope
bobby lee holds the lens of the scope to his mouth blows a breath on it and wipes it clean with a piece of clean cloth
he feels eyes and turns to see
sally watching him at work
bobby lee smiles at her cocksure
his dark role in this manhunt is now perfectly clear
sally turns her head disgusted
gladys perry frazzled somewhat in shock is ushered forward
shes handed the megaphone
she fumbles with it pushes the button
it squawks loudly

red just shakes his head and sighs
bobby lee leans on the hood of the car and places one eye behind the scope of his rifle

red glares at bobby lee for an extended moment
yells to butch you got yerself a deal
yells one more thing
his old lady has to swear to take him trick r treatin every year
phillip strains to look for his mom
hes upset ready to leave
gimme yer list phillip

phillip pulls it out
butch snatches it and reads it to himself laughing
hes on a death roll of sorts between losing blood and being in an impossible situation he almost seems to be enjoying the macabre scenario as it unfolds
phillip on the other hand is beginning to sob
yells and shes gotta promise to take him to the fair for rollercoasters and cotton candy whenever he wants
or at least once a year

butch reaches into his pocket extracts the remaining wad of stolen bills unzips the casper outfit stuffs them into the costume and rezips

phillip quiets for a moment and stares at butch

butch nudges phillip and the boy starts toward the field
adler looking through binoculars cant help but smile
gimme them things
adler hands over the binoculars
red takes a look
nee casper walking in his full whitehood arms reaching for the sky
phillip reaches level ground and for the first time sees the full strength of the amassed police forces at least cars swirling lights guns everywhere pointing at him

phillip stops walking and stands perfectly still
red lowers his binocs
to himself why the hells he stoppin
to gladys direct call for yer boy to come
gladys near shock ad libs commands to phillip

note her commands become more and more shrieking and frantic and continue throughout giving rise to even more confusion than is already present
phillip turns back and sees
butch he tries to get up in an attempt to make a run for it but his strength is gone
phillip standing still with his mothers shrieks filling the air behind him watches butch for a second then runs back toward him
red sighs and lowers the binocs
phillip stands before a struggling butch
personally i think we negotiated a pretty fair deal but if theres somethin else you want
disbelief do they want to shoot you
butch starts to lie to the boy but cant
a finger strokes the trigger of a high powered rifle
bobby lee smiling ready waiting
red shrugs and wipes his brow
he thought better of releasin the hostage
it doesnt necessarily mean that
to bobby lee stay on ready
phillip holds his hand out and helps butch get up
butch stands dusts himself off grabs the boys hand and to gether they walk toward the field
red through the binoculars
i seen it all now
butch and phillip hand in hand walking across the field
red scratches his head
whats he up to
hell if i know
hes giving himself up
keep in mind he still has the gun
yells to butch butch
stop and let the boy go
put yer hands up and let the boy go
note ad lib instructions from red continue as well
with all the yelling its hard to make out whats being said
butch and phillip continue to walk and talk
so i guess thats it for alaska phillip
stop and put your hands on your head
come here phillip
to herself come on come on
a warning chief weve got an armed killer and an innocent boy out there
to bobby lee you clean
as a whistle
keep him locked down
dont squeeze til i say when
red holds bobby lees eyes until the young fed nods
then red unstraps his holster and moves between the cars
where the hell you going
but reds not listening just walking long and tall into the field
butch and phillip continue to walk butch holding phillips hand
when butch spots red approaching he slows and then stops
red shows his palms and keeps walking toward them
when he gets within feet he stops
toss your gun on the ground
if i had a pistola id be headed the other direction
my partner here got rid of the evidence
beat do i know you friend
well look i wanna talk to the boy and then well take care of bidness
only take a second
red nods then looks over his shoulder at the patrol cars lined up like a wagon train guns aimed bobby lee peering through the scope of his rifle
butch and phillip
i wanna give ya somethin
hes gonna make a run for it
give it a second
to bobby lee hold him
yells let the boy go butch
to bobby lee if he makes a move
butch kneels down beside phillip
he reaches slowly pain fully for his back pocket
mebe someday youll get to go
hendricks looks through the binocs
hes goin for his weapon
butch reaches into his back pocket
red squints to make out what butchs reaching for
butch smiles as he retrieves the postcard from his pocket
a look of concern crosses reds lips
sally realizes its not a gun that butch is reaching for
squeezes an explosion followed by a ringing echo
butchs chest explodes when the bullet hits him
he rocks backwards still on his knees
and looks at phillip in amazement
phillip screams grabs butch and holds him up
phillip is obscuring a second shot at butch
tastes blood and sighs
damn buzz shot twice in the same day
he collapses and falls into phillips arms
phillip backs away two steps and falls to his knees
butch wavers for a second then topples on his back
phillip moans sobs as he watches butch the gunshot still gladys runs from behind the car followed by a host of officers
keep everybody back
bobby lee stands lowers his rifle disengages and smiles at hendricks
no need to worry
he cant hurt nobody now
red stands frozen staring in another world
an officer trots up to butch and does a careful ground frisk
calls back no weapon chief
red comes to turns and walks toward the
red walks up to bobby lee stops and stares at the grinning marksman
after a beat red turns then nearly jumps out of shoes with a sudden right cross that floors the younger man
red starts to jump in for more but hendricks stunned jumps in grabs red and joined by four other officers holds the older man back
hey hey red whoa whoa
red settles a bit
hendricks turns to bobby lee who rises to one knee and wipes at a bloody lip and then to red who is still breathing hard
what the hell was that all about
i didnt say when
red turns and walks away
hendricks throws his hat to the ground kicks it and follows red with his eyes
to no one everyone goddammit
adler catches up to red
he stares at his old friend and boss as they walk along
i thought he had a gun too red
there was just no way of knowin
red doesnt even look at adler just keeps walking
adler stops his eyes following red
sally nearby watches red walk away
is helped to his feet by his mother
she holds him dearly to her chest
he hugs back just as hard his blood stained casper outfit staining her blouse
she unzips the costume and dollar bills fly all around
she starts to lead phillip off but he wont leave until
he pulls the postcard from butchs hand
staring down at butch
his eyes flutter a bit with recognition
red leans against the car
after a few seconds sally walks up and finds a spot a few feet down from him where she too leans against the car
after a few more seconds
you did everything you could
you know that
red just stares straight ahead
i dont know nuthin
not a damn thing
red reaches into his pocket pulls out his tobacco and stuffs a chunk into his mouth
he licks his lips as the muffled voices continue around him
he squints hard and sees as it lifts off and speeds away
as it wipes the sun
a slight smile crosses his dying face as he squints to see phillips flight
nose pressed against the glass bubble
his eyes dont close still squinted but frozen
we realize now are lifeless
continues its flight past the sun
flares sending the screen to that opened the film
