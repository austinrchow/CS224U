written by george nolfi after a few introductory credits we pull back to reveal the source of this kaleidoscopic backdrop a single striped tulip planted in a long row of
a hand reaches in and pulls the tulip from the ground
we then cut to a a basket of tulips carried by hand to a truck where it a is loaded with hundreds of other baskets
the door of the truck is shut and we cut to b the door of the truck opening to reveal that the tulips b are now boxed and crated
a forklift moves the crates onto a wagon which is driven by a manned cart across the biggest warehouse on the planet the bloenen markt check this steven in amsterdam
the cart and wagons we were following disappear into a maze of synchronized activity
c the cart arrives in the auction room which is c constructed like an ampitheater the buyers sit in a steeply raked semi circle facing two giant clock shaped scoreboards
that display the bids on the flowers being viewed
the striped tulips fetch a very high price
d the carts of striped tulips are delivered to an automated d sorting apparatus of enormous size and complexity
they end up on a truck heading for the airport
e the tulips are loaded onto a plane
during the transatlantic flight they sit nestled in the cargo hold
f the tulips are unloaded from the plane driven across an f airport tarmac and loaded onto another plane
g the tulips are unloaded from the plane and loaded onto a g truck
the truck drives through a small town and pulls into the back of a a young man takes delivery of the flowers and carries them through the rear of the
store to the display area up front
we stay on the tulips as we hear the following conversation wow
how do they do that
its an accident
it means the flower developed a virus early in the bulb stage
the flaws create the unusual coloring
can you arrange something for me with those
what kind of price range are you looking for
now we see the customer tess
well its for my parents anniversary
they dont know im coming
i just want it to be beautiful
can you just do whatever you think looks best
ill need a few minutes
take your time please
and thank you
the owner moves toward a corner of the store where the flowers are arranged
tess walks around looking at the rest of the store
tess looks out the window
a black sedan is pulling up at the curb
that should be some surprise
for your parents
i hope so
one of the power twins gets out of the drivers side door and crosses in front of the car
tess starts moving away from the window
which one is it
i think i have an idea
the power twin opens the rear passenger side door revealing tess turns away from the window
do you have a bathroom
straight back on the left
tess scurries to the back
to tess a caveat its unisex
tess flies past the bathroom and heads for the back door
she pushes through it and runs right into power twin no
a nice place on the eastern seaboard
we hear the faint sound of a phone ring
danny ocean picks up the receiver checks the caller id
he smiles and answers miguel diaz speaking
almost immediately his expression clouds
he looks at his watch
danny contd tess tess
you remember what we talked about if this happened
call me in twenty four hours on that number
he hangs up the phone and runs out of the house
he doesnt take anything with him
danny runs out of the house and down the street leaving his car in the driveway
tess floral arrangement in her lap sits in the car with benedict
what about them
we had dinner with them three years ago
you talked about your parents anniversary
she says nothing
benedict contd im getting married next month
so am i
well i hope danny is as good as he thinks he is
a bouquet toss in prison can get pretty ugly
danny takes a safe deposit box out of a wall he opens the box revealing a cell phone and some cash
danny boards a train
the landscape hurtles by
we pan over to find danny sitting next to the window
we continue to pan and find reuben tishkoff seated next to a group of male commuters
over i really think youre being too sensitive
shes crazy about you
i can tell
reuben lies in a mud bath his face covered with a dried exfoliating mask treatment
there is a cigar in one hand and a cellphone in the other
his eyes are closed to the sun
joyce shes ninety two
im all she has left
beat the wheelchair thing was an accident shes having some trouble with the joystick
ill adjust it
beat i told you when her mouth hangs open like that that means shes happy
beat i am
when are you coming over
reuben contd youre tired because you work too much
you dont have to work all the time
dont you want to take a break
those trays look so heavy
beat of course
how could you ask that
beat because when i heard you laugh all my problems disappeared
a shadow crosses over reubens face and reuben squints open one eye
there with the sun like an aura behind his head is reuben is handed a bloody mary by the porter who then continues on bringing a glass of white wine
to the amazing yen swims a strong steady freestyle
pull back to reveal that he is swimming in a by endless pool in his th floor shanghai apartment
a hand moves into frame and turns off the water current
yen immediately slams into the end of his jacuzzi sized pool
he lifts his head out of the water to see the power twins standing poolside
he spits out a stream of invective in chinese
the power twins look at each other
yen sets his magazine down and heads for the bathroom where turk and virgil malloy are waiting in line
the opening doesnt work
she shouldnt have the same dream as franklin
hes the antagonist
it was your idea
no it wasnt
well it wasnt mine
it couldnt be its too stupid
why do you do that
why do you have to get personal
its not personal its a fact
virgil and turk malloy in gtx lycra yoga gear lead a class mostly female through the vinyassa
the studio is mirrored on three sides
you dont argue logically
to the class bring the right foot back even with the left buttocks raised high
to virgil you have to have reasons to support your argument
to the class flattening the back so the body forms a triangle
i cant listen to you anymore
it makes me physically sick
turk looks to him but also sees a guy in the class staring at all of the women raising their buttocks high
he indicates this to virgil who goes over to the guy
relax the crown of the head toward the floor
draw the hips away from the hands len gthening the spine
and press the heels toward the floor
virgil steps on the guys back and leans down to whisper in his ear
this a serious class
no pigs allowed
virgil stands up
benedict and the power twins are standing right behind him
his expression changes as he sees them in the mirror
the malloys and yen are still waiting for the bathroom
yeah whatever oj
finally the lock opens and rusty ryan exits
we follow him to his seat where he puts on a pair of headphones
of molten metal bubbling in a small iron cask a jewelers cask
move to reveal a garage filled mostly with cars in some state of restoration find rusty as he painstakingly works on a new piece that is just below frame
whatever it is it is clearly getting to him
he shakes his head its not right
its just not good enough
rusty glances at the digital thermometer attached to the cask of molten metal
you are kidding me
rusty glances in his rearview as he drives through the city talking on his cell phone
hes keeping an eye on a white cadillac that seem to be following him
degrees fahrenheit felix
i watched it
what do you want from me
rusty turns a corner then glances in his rearview again
i want what i paid for
and thats what i sent
no felix no
i paid for pure
and if my workshop were on top of mount everest it would be pure
but im at sea level felix and at sea level it should liquefy at
if its pure that is
which this isnt
rusty makes another turn
a few seconds later the cadillac turns behind him
well i didnt know you were going to liquefy it
rusty pulls to a stop light
the cadillac pulls up three cars behind him
let me ask you something when christo calls his cotton supplier and asks for cotton cloth do you think his supplier sends him cotton and polyester and when that doesnt
work says to christo well you should have told me you were going to wrap the coast of australia
rusty looks to the heavens
felix youre in a shame spiral
have your assistant lose my number
rusty snaps his phone shut
rusty contd my god
rusty looks into the rear view mirror and then slows the car to a stop
he gets out of his car and slams the door shut
he walks back to the cadillac and knocks on the window
it rolls down electronically to reveal benedict
rusty contd how long you gonna give us
rusty continues to listen to his headset
we pan over to see frank catton seated opposite him
the penthouse apartment
it takes the entire floor and has a degree view
right now all of the furniture inside of it is being taken away by movers
frank enters frame
we stole that money fair and square
you bought people off to find me
you took advantage during an economic downturn and made them say some shit they shouldnt have said
its not fair its not just and it aint cool
a long beat
benedict stares back at him
frank contd did you hear what i just said
i heard what you said frank
did you hear what i said
frank looks at benedict and the power twins
frank takes us to livingston
livingston performs a stand up routine
how many people here tonight were stupid enough to have children
a few people raise their hands
livingston contd wow
no seriously thats great
i have a child
they get to you right
am i right
i mean sometimes shell turn to me with her little face and her little shiny eyes and shell say daddy please stop hitting me and it just breaks my heart
people arent sure what to make of this
livingston contd im livingston dell
thanks for listening
see you at ten
livingston strides off stage as we see that he is at the bellagio in the lounge
benedict and the power twins are waiting for him
somehow he isnt surprised
livingston contd to benedict i appreciate you letting me finish my run
youve been very patient
what can i say
youre a funny guy
livingston takes us to saul bloom reading the racing form
all dark wood and oriental rugs
move across a row of oil paintings that flatter stodgy club members from the s to the present
land on saul sitting in window light that mimics the aforementioned portraits
what it is about horses
i ask you
is it the strength
but theres something else
something in the eyes
the person with him nods
saul contd yes
when i look into a horses eyes i can tell this ones a winner
a jacketed waiter appears holding a tray
excuse me mr
there appears to be a problem with your card
the waiter tips the tray to reveal sauls credit card which has been cut into tiny pieces
without missing a beat he reaches for his wallet
you take visa
i was acting on instructions from your business manager
my business manager
saul leads us to basher
basher is putting the finishing touches on a song
a producer and engineer sit behind a huge mixing console
its good bashers really got something going here
basher is leaning over a thick legal document and benedict is leaning over him
the music has been turned off
look at it this way
if the album goes platinum itll cover what you owe
and if the second one goes gold that should cover the interest
basher takes us to linus
linus looking from the front seat to the back talking to benedict
im responsible for myself
i have my own life and my own plans
ive never asked for anything but a fair shake
we make a deal i stick to the deal
he turns forward thinking
then after a beat he turns back to benedict
linus contd i just need to be absolutely clear that we have an understanding if you contact my father ill kill myself and youll never get the rest of your
linus turns forward and exhales relieved
linus takes us back to danny
the train hurtles onward
reuben yen the malloys frank livingston saul basher and linus are all talking at once right at us
right at danny
and they are not happy
the group is in an abandoned warehouse somewhere near nyc
danny is overwhelmed like a deer caught in the headlights
he throws a desperate glance at rusty whos looking out the window serenely letting danny flounder
everyone just stares at danny waiting for an answer
how many cant make the deadline
everyone raises their hands except reuben
off their looks so im smarter than those schmucks on wall street
whose fault is that
how many think if they run theyll be found
everyone raises their hands
danny gets up walks over to rusty
the rest of the guys shrug and begin talking amongst themselves
after a long beat
danny contd well the only other were on the five oclock
danny contd where
danny steps back
dannys tone draws everyones attention
noticing this danny and rusty move into a nearby dilapidated office doorway
the guys go back to talking mostly about what they were doing when they were found
this rises steadily in volume until the din is obliterated by a loud voice danny contd the guys exchange glances
danny walks over to them and sighs
livingston hands his passport to a klm agent
flight to amsterdam
jump cut to the agent handing livingston his boarding pass
youre in seat j
enjoy your flight
there must be some mistake
is your first class section in the back of the plane
the agent looks back at him confused
jump cut to the agent handing linus his boarding pass klm agent contd cut to the agent handing virgil and turk their tickets
klm agent contd c and d
jump cut to the agent handing saul his boarding pass klm agent contd fifty five k
theres a fifty five weve increased capacity by employing advanced design technology
you made the seats smaller
can you just say that
you made the seats smaller
jump cut to show frank see youre not hearing me
what im trying to tell you is the reservations agent made a mistake when she issued the ticket because on the rare occasions that i fly commercially i always book
a first class ticket with no restrictions the desk agent looks back at him skeptically
she may have air but this is the only ticket available to you on this flight
i need you to step aside so i can take care of the next customer
now listen dont make me get black
frank stands with his arm outstretched shoes and belt off
two tsa officers run metal detecting wands over every inch of his body
three more guys pick through his luggage they squeeze toothpaste from his sensodyne tube sniff his hair products unroll his tighty whitey briefs
pan to reveal that basher is getting the exact same treatment right next to him
they exchange looks
reverse angle the rest of the group stands sipping iced lattes from starbucks and watching the show
reuben walks up
i wanted to wish you luck
and listen i want to do something for you
reuben hands danny an envelope
this is the least i can do
ive got a friend who owns the bellagio of amsterdam and ive made reservations for all of you there
its all taken care of
thats very touching reuben
its the least i could do
i love you guys
yen says something in chinese
reuben contd no thank you
yen sits in first class playing an in seat video
virgil and turk kneel on either side watching his progress
gentlemen youll have to go back to your seats now
reluctantly they do
we follow them back to coach where they pass linus talking to himself
beat planning stages
we move on to find livingston who grabs turk by the arm
howd he get that seat
turk moves on taking us past a sleeping saul and landing on danny and rusty who watch a movie with fixed expressions
a reverse angle shows us that the video screen is twenty rows away it is impossible to discern any detail at all
rusty takes his headphones off and exhales
danny notices this and does the same
after a beat call me an elitist asshole call me a bourgeois clown call me anything you want but economy is bullshit
oh i dont know
its not that ba the guy in front of danny moves his seat back suddenly and spills dannys drink all over dannys lap
linus approaches danny and rusty
you guys have a minute
whats on your mind
well i know this may not be the exact right time to bring this up but ive been thinking about
well about where i want to be in five years career wise and ive decided i really want to be more than just a role player
i really see myself as kind of an idea man like you guys
i mean i know you do your part and youre in the trenches with us and all but its really your show and like i said five years from now
i want to be running my own show
danny and rusty exchange a look
then look back at linus
so if theres any opportunity for me to be involved in the you know planning stages of things i would really appreciate it
i really feel like im ready for more responsibility and that i could really make a contribution
rusty turns to danny
are you thinking what im thinking
to linus were negotiating the terms with her tomorrow
you feel up to taking the lead
are you serious
this isnt some gag
that would be awesome
i wasnt sure if i should say anything
now im glad i did
so are we
were here to listen
you wont regret this
danny and rusty put their headphones back on
now they look content
basher and frank watch linus go
he can be a tom
anybody can be a tom
you gotta make your own opportunities
this aint a rehearsal
saul chews his economy class trail mix
boy youre tough
stop calling me boy
saul stops chewing
they look at each other
establishing shots of the city
the group makes their way down a damp cobblestone street
they stop in front of a window and look up
they have stopped in front of a narrow townhouse that has been converted to a hotel
the sign says bellagio of amsterdam
a single room with bunks in it
their noses are wrinkled up because the place stinks
how could he lie to us like that
the sign said the bellagio of amsterdam
everyone looks at each other and turns to leave
wait a minute
look you guys no frills no perks run and gun all that stuff and i said no problem because i believed you were right that we shouldnt go deeper into
debt and spend money we dont have
i mean am i the only one who thinks this might actually be a good thing
that we could use a little humility
that maybe we were a little too pleased and impressed with ourselves after the benedict job
okay i grant you that maybe this isnt what we deserve but maybe its what we need
we can do this
no i take it back we have to do this
a long beat
four black mercedes skid to a stop outside amsterdams finest five star hotel
everyone emerges with big smiles on their faces
everyone except linus
he scowls yanks his bag back from the hotel doorman who rushed over to take it for him
tess enters and buys a phone card
tess talks to danny
across the street a black sedan is parked
what are you doing in amsterdam
only what i have to do to get benedict off our backs
be careful danny
its the same
its not your fault
i keep trying to figure out what i did wrong
how did he find us
tess cant bring herself to tell danny the truth that it was entirely her fault
danny dont keep thinking about it
i did something wrong
he should never have found us
ill call you tomorrow
i love you
i love you
danny hangs up the phone and site
in other rooms the guys get themselves settled in
each takes a step toward personalizing their suite
danny and rusty lead an obviously eager linus towards a coffee house
shell try and use her looks to distract you
dont let her
be polite but firm
dont get soft on us
dont make too many concessions
danny and rusty nod
who is obviously a man in drag
linus looks to danny and rusty but they give him nothing
the onset of summer is like a woman who owns too many shoes
she he looks to linus who looks to danny and rusty
bailing linus out if animals were capable of flattery the world bank would be open until pm
when i was four years old i saw my mother kill a spider with a tea cozy
again the evelyn looks to linus who has nothing to say
a doctor who specializes in skin diseases will dream that he has fallen asleep in front of the television
later he will wake up in front of the television but not remember his dream
evelyn nods and looks to linus as do danny and rusty
he furrows his brow then speaks o let the sun beat down upon my face stars to fill my dreams
i am a traveler of both time and space to be where i have been
danny and rusty stare at linus like hes nuts like hes just cracked
evelyns entire expression changes
your young friend has a great deal to learn about respect
she he puts his her drink down and walks to another part of the establishment
why dont you wait outside
rusty and danny follow evelyn and quietly console him her
linus cools his heels
danny and rusty emerge from inside
is that your idea of making a contribution
her terms were scandalous
and we were lucky to get them after what you said
the deal was this close to being blown
danny and rusty just look at him
linus contd i know what you guys are doing
danny and rusty exhange looks
linus contd look
person had too many cupcakes
they just keep staring at him
linus contd i was playing along
you called her mother a whore
a really cheap one
guys im not falling for this
but danny and rusty arent laughing
they look pissed
linus contd i mean
danny and rusty just look at him
linus contd i called her mother a whore
danny and rusty explain the job to the group
its a privately owned home
but dont let that fool you
its extremely well protected
a photo of a four story canal house is displayed on a flat screen connected to livingstons computer
what are we after
a very old very valuable document
a photo labeled the vanderspeigle getuigschrift is displayed on screen
what is it
a stock certificate
the first one ever issued from the first corporation on the planet
the dutch east india trading company
its the only one of its kind and its worth a boat load
whats our cut
million after expenses
turk seems confused
who negotiated this
danny and rusty look at linus thanks
what do we know so far
theres a dummy key pad by the front door
points to a diagram but the alarm is really controlled by the keypad in mr
vanderspeigles second floor office
now heres good news we already know the systems master code
evelyn gave it to us
thats not good news thats really good news
we just wait until he leaves
thats the bad news
doesnt like what hes hearing
shots of their mark vanderspeigle being an agoraphobic weirdo
so hes never been out of his house
not once since he moved in ten years ago
doesnt this guy believe in fresh air
cracks his windows at night
thats about it
when vanderspeigle cracks his window we see that locking pins fall into place to prevent the window from opening more than a few inches
can we tap into the system from the outside through the phone lines
its a closed loop system with two redundant servers locked into titanium cases in the guys bedroom
a we see the servers in vanderspeigles bedroom
a could we use a remote device to trigger the panel
its hard wired and shielded
guys am i missing something here
we know his damn code right
youre telling me with that much information we cant find a way into this freaks house
frank flinches again
he seem to be reacting to the term freak
cant we just get a telephone repair truck
put the basket up and use a telescoping rod through the open window to tap out the guys code
turks idea plays out as it is in his minds eye until the street in front of the house is blocked off to vehicles
and its covered by five independently wired surveillance cameras
monitored hours a day by a security company
we see the security arrangements they describe
god this guy really is a freak
frank reacts again to the term freak
it really bothers him
dont call the guy a freak okay
everyone turns and looks at frank like hes a freak
frank contd what
the entire room is staring at him
frank contd what
i mean am i the only one here who feels funny about stealing from a
danny looks to one side of the room
then the other
the rest of the room agrees
everyone just turns back to what theyre doing
danny contd okay so we know what we cant do
danny contd time to think outside the box guys
then okay heres something
ive got an idea
suppose we no
well but how theres a goldmann grid over the enitre surface
linus looks at him
rusty contd is that what you were thinking about
sudden idea but
well thats different
especially if we rusty makes a circular motion with his finger and then stops it with his other hand
quick aside to linus a schuman special
then to livingston livingston absolutely
i mean id need a day to youll have three
just gotta get the gear
yen says something in chinese
rusty contd what and give up show business
saul i know i know
ill be bored
youll be fine
everyone gets up and leaves
within seconds linus is alone standing in the middle of the room
whats a schuman special
livingston uses a mock up of the alarm panel as a visual aid
to basher your shot has to hit directly above the keypad
we see basher rehearsing the shot
he cant get a clear shot of the target
in fact he cant see it
he turns to saul
let me see the specs
saul pulls a well worn copy of the alarm system blueprint
basher goes to the height of the alarm keypad in the bedroom
how tall is the surface of this roof
how tall exactly
danny looks at a diagram of the safe theyll have to crack when they get inside vanderspeigles house the safe that contains the vanderspeigle getuigschrift
everyone but linus and rusty are here
but then rusty comes in
youre not going to believe this
we dont have line of sight
we tried everywhere
some places were only three or four inches off
theres no straight shot
even with basher
its literally impossible
linus enters out of breath
seeing everyone he goes to danny and rusty
can i talk to you guys for a second
they nod and allow linus to pull them into the corner
linus looks over at the group and then turns to them
listen ive done a little research on the schuman special and uh
we dont have line of sight for the shot
thisll kill us
to linus listen dont say anything
if youre ever going to run your own crew youve got to remember to never show weakness
its like blood in the water for these guys
if they think youre slipping you wont even see it coming
but hey thanks
linus nods and goes back to the group
to danny i need some air
rusty and danny walk along the adjacent road
the swinging priest
not enough time
too many variables
too many obstacles
the soft shoulder
not enough people
wed need a woman
hell in a handbasket
cant train the cat that quickly
i cant have my wife watch me hauled off in handcuffs again
its always about you isnt it
this like running toward a cliff
speaking of which hows isabel
i have no idea what youre talking about
you get the tattoo removed
given its location my doctor advised against it
rusty stops walking
danny continues then notices he is alone
he turns back to rusty
what are you doing
as danny and rusty enter the hotel rusty trips on the steps
rusty bends down to look at the step
he notices that one tile on the edge of the stop has lost some mortar
he touches the tile and watches the lip rise up and down up and down as though its cantilevered
you want to do what
reverse to reveal rusty and danny
raise it slightly
the whole house
its only a few inches
then ill have line of sight
we cant tilt a whole house
they did it with the leaning tower of pisa
it took three hundred guys two years to do that
nobodys ever done anything like this
palowski did it in in venice and in istanbul
and he only had a crew of six
there are thirty pylons
we cut them insert the jacks and crank
for nineteen hours
heres the order in which they have to be done
it is pouring rain
from across the canal we move towards vanderspeigles house favoring a barge moored just out front
then instead of moving over the barge we push through its hull to find frank and livingston inside manning a series of industrial water pumps
theyre grimy and covered in sweat
rain drips through the deck above them
so basher approached me about being on a crew
frank thinks about that
yen pops his head out from a small tube and says something in chinese
yen tries again
this time he enunciates very clearly and talks very loudly like americans do when foreigners dont understand english
frank nods starts turning the handle of the water pump in the opposite direction
yen climbs down out of the tube
then he climbs back up the tube
he picks up a jack in the corner
climbs back in the tube
we follow him as he climbs through the tube and emerges underneath vanderspeigles house inside its foundation
the thirty pylons extend from the base of the house into the into the swamp it sits atop of
there is little space between the swamp level and the house
runoff from the rain outside drips everywhere
find danny and rusty struggling to place a hand cranked jack into a freshly cut space in one of the timber pylons
they are covered in muck and grime the good news is after the first twelve hours i stopped being able to smell anything
took a few more for me
this water was stagnant six hundred years ago
find the malloys thirty feet away using a fancy underwater saw to cut a space in another pylon
because the cutting is taking place underwater it is extremely quiet
theres no reason for him not to
he would go to the cops
okay so he goes to the cops
then they arrest dominique
then we have no story
she steals the money from mr
they turn to look at linus sawing nearby
why would she
to pay franklin to keep quiet
turk and virgil think about that
linus keeps sawing
basher and saul sit in big cushiony chairs
beat i have to tell you its not something i condone
it is cheating
theres no subtlety to it
its kind of embarrassing
no one i know
i cant imagine anything like that
a long beat
then each of them reach into their jackets and produce bills
they exchange and examine the bills closely by eye
satisfied they trade them again and return them to their coat pockets
i told him about you
im too old
my stuff is cheap compared to that
its just me and my gal you know
what youre talking about is organized
but thanks anyway
frank sits watching tv
livingston enters with groceries
jay leno called
when are you gonna stop with that tired white people cant be funny stuff
its so old frank really
do you want some orange juice
i got the good kind
just then they are interrupted by dannys voice on a walkie talkie
augie one this is condor
rusty turns to danny
this is augie one go condor
were fully cranked here
lets go to phase two
livingston and frank look at each other
bring that orange juice
basher sets up his gear again
this time when he raises the crossbow to check his shot he can see the keypad
he steadies himself
saul knows that hes ready to take the shot
he speaks into a walkie talkie
this is gatsby
were green here
the instant he fires the shot we a male secretary hess rushes through europols extraordinary richard meier designed headquarters
europol agent isabel lahiri gives a presentation to seventy five of her colleagues
with her on stage are a couple of seated higher up types
lets discuss briefly and to begin with the category of thieves as distinguished from the larger category of what might be termed hardened criminals
the highest level master thieves if you will is a very small world
between six and ten high level crews are operating in europe at any given time
worldwide no more than twenty
the most famous gaspar lemarc is either dead or retired and the expectation is that no one will replace him
the good news is the trend is toward their extinction
the secretary enters the auditorium and walks toward the podium
for example anecdotal evidence suggest these people are personally insufferable
the higher ups look at each other what did she just say
their egos demand constant praise and they embellish their exploits to anyone who will listen
they tell their own stories endlessly provided of course they are talking to a fellow thief or an intimate
many in the audience are now looking to each other wondering if this is appropriate
those who interact with them on a personal level are relegated to positions of total servitude with no chance for growth or freedom
their lives are treated as secondary
many of them suffer from depression
its a crime for which there is no law and yet causes untold damage
one of the higher ups convinces the other to say something but by now hess the male secretary has reached isabel and interrupts her by whispering into her ear
isabel contd amplified by the lectern mic isabel and hess walk briskly through the ultra modern hallway
he briefs her as they walk in a hushed voice
then something he says stops her in her tracks
hess continues to explain something we cant hear
then he pulls out some photos
isabel leafs through them
isabel arrives and is greeted by paul a lead detective working the vanderspeigle theft for the amsterdam police department
thanks for coming
we can really use your help on this one
his partner looks over at isabel who is wearing a skirt and pretty damn good shoes
the guy checks out her legs and looks away
i hope the scene hasnt been contaminated
isabel walks away
moments later she enters the house with the lead detective
as soon as shes inside shes all business
no forced entry
not that we can find
isabel looks around vanderspeigles home office
behind a fake bookcase is a small room which contains the safe
in the other direction is vanderspeigles bedroom
nods we cant figure out how they disabled the alarm
we thought maybe they tried to short it out somehow
no that would have triggered the system
isabel goes to the alarm pad
pulls the face plate off examines the inside
isabel contd and damaged the circuits
well then i dont know how they got in
they had to have known the code
she moves on to look in the marks bedroom
calls to her we considered that but the mark swears that nobody in the world knew the code except him
he programmed the last seven steps of the system himself
he set it and never left the house again
when he dies well probably have to physically cut all the power lines to the house to get it off line
isabel examines the computer brain of the alarm system which was locked inside a titanium case in vanderspeigles bedroom closet
she answers the detective almost as an afterthought
there are other ways to get the code
to herself closed loop
the lead detective enters the bedroom
again isabel is inside her own mind
shes really just answering the detectives questions out of courtesy
well they probably set up in a house across the canal and watched him type the code in through a pair of binoculars
we go with him as he walks back into the office
he stands at the alarm panel and pretends to type in the code
he twists around and looks out the window behind him
calling to isabel in the bedroom actually i dont know about that
isabel re enters the office
paul contd unless he had a habit of typing in the code like this he stands to the side of the panel and reaches over to type in the numbers
its an obviously unnatural position
then he moves in front of the panel and types in the code as one normally would
paul contd then his body would block the view from across the canal
thats why they probably set up over there she points out an adjacent window on another wall
isabel contd and used the mirror
she points at a small mirror on the opposite wall
the detective bends down so his eye is at the level of the keypad then he looks in the mirror
he can see directly across the canal into another house
isabel contd im guessing theyd need a fifteen hundred millimeter lens to get a clear shot but but isabels already moved on
something has caught her attention just above the alarm panel a patch of paint that is shinier than the paint that surrounds it
isabel puts her finger to her tongue to wet it then touches the shiny area
when she pulls her finger away there is paint on it
isabel cocks her head
a black clad thief linus uses a paint brush to touch up the wall above the alarm keypad
the lead detective watches isabel intently
what is it
isabel uses the blunt end of a letter opener from vanderspeigles desk to gently dig at the wall under the paint
the plaster there is soft and wet
in fact it isnt plaster at all
paul contd what is that
isabel cooks her head again
a crossbow bolt hits the wall above the alarm panel
its where the crossbow bolt hit
a crossbow bolt
ever heard of franz schuman
isabel is at the window
the one that vanderspeigle leaves cracked open every night
isabel looks across the canal at the apartment where basher and saul were playing cards
they would have fired from that roof
through this open window
isabel kneels down checks the line of sight to make sure shes correct
from that roof through this window
nobody could make a shot like that
not a cop anyway
whats that supposed to mean
your friend downstairs put me in a bad mood
hes an idiot
you shouldnt let him bother you
isabel pulls out a notepad and writes the name eugene basher tarr
there are two names above bashers in her little book robert ryan and danny ocean
isabel contd but these man are exceptionally good
even when they make mistakes
a bolt flies through vanderspeigles open window and hits the wall above the alarm pad
two thin wires are attached to a tiny wheel which is attached to the back of the bolt
the wires run back to the window of the apartment across the canal
inside that apartment the wires end in another tiny wheel which is mounted on a large tripod for stability
in effect the group now has a mini clothesline running between the alarm pad and the apartment across the canal
livingston attaches a device designed to fit directly over the number pad of vanderspeigles keypad to the clothesline that runs across the canal
isabel writes livingston dell
underneath bashers name in her notebook
livingstons device is shuttled across the canal through vanderspeigles cracked window and right to the alarm panel
magnets on the side of the device cause it to snap into place over the top of the keypad
livingston then types a six digit code into a remote keypad
his keypunches are mimicked by the remote device
vanderspeigles alarm shuts off
downstairs from inside we see the front door lock picked
the door swings open
isabel nods her head
theres a slight smile on her face
the smile of admiration respect in anothers skills
when did he get up and notice the certificate was gone
the alarm woke him at o am
but the alarm would have been she stops
and smiles to herself
isabel contd oh
oh i know what happened
isabel quickly glances around the room
her eye lands on the floor near the false bookcase
on some dark lines in the crevices where the floor boards meet
she kneels down for a closer look
there was someone else
danny and rusty come through the front door
they are followed by linus
all of them are soaking wet from hours in the swamp under the house and the last few minutes in the pouring rain outside the front door
the group silently slips up the stairs
oh i wish i couldve have seen that
they enter vanderspeigles office
you can hear him snoring in the other room
danny and rusty quickly carefully remove the crossbow bolt from the wall and take it to the window
they drop it and the attached wires to the malloys who are waiting on the street below
meanwhile linus spackles the hole in the wall and paints over the spackle
danny and rusty turn to see that linus is finished
they hand signal each other like special forces guys do then move towards the bookcase on the adjacent wall
that must have really been something
danny puts his hand up to his ear to try to listen for the sound he thought he heard
we hear the faint sound of somebody singing to themselves
danny and rusty quickly realize its coming from behind the bookcase
what the hell
they yank open the false bookcase to reveal a handsome frenchman who has just finished cleaning out the contents of vanderspeigles safe
danny and rusty stare at him
he turns around and sees them but if hes bothered in the slightest he sure isnt showing it
danny approaches him
this exchange is whispered with a great amount of drama at very close range
can i help you
what the hell are you doing
i am getting here first
just then frank and yen arrive
the frenchman looks them over
this is our score
i am here before you
joining we let you in the house
somehow you got in after we hit the code but before we got to the door
thats thirty seconds
how could i know which exact thirty seconds i had
unless i knew you plan
could i have known your plan
do you have a snitch in your group
yes i know you dont
because i saw the whole thing from that chair
i knew you were around but i had my own plan
yen says something in chinese
theres really no need for that
danny wants to raise his voice but he cant
vanderspeigle is snoring twenty feet away
listen we have to come to some arrangement
weve incurred some very serious costs here
danny and rusty look at him
well we have
the malloys arrive
every second i am becoming more outnumbered
whispering re dinner jacket whos this
he said he got here first
this is our goddamned job
he sounds as angry as a guy whos whispering can sound
if the situation were reversed but the situation is not reversed
the situation is that i am here first without any help from you
livingston arrives soaking wet like everyone else
so as much as i would basher and saul arrive
jesus how many of you are there
just give us the stock certificate
whatever else you took out of that safe
dinner jacket stops
thinks for a moment
but i leave you with something
he hands danny a business card
in case evelyns employer tries anything
dinner jacket smiles then pulls a tiny electronic device out of his shirt pocket
he presses a button
and the alarm blares to life
paul stares at isabel
are you sure
im sure theres another scenario that would fit these physical details but i dont know what it is
where should we start
isabel takes out her pda writes something on her keypad and hits a few buttons
a second later pauls beeper goes off
you can start by picking that guy up
the group sits around looking depressed
who the hell was that guy
its going to get out you know
people are going to find out
somebody must know this blokes name
the question is who trained him
he got into that place alone
i believed him
unsettled you think hes better than us
im not saying anything but the man was sitting there waiting for us
do you think the cops even know who this guys is
that guys never even seen a cop
maybe he works with the cops
you dont work with the cops unless you absolutely have to
and not even then
either way hes got to have a name
it cant be that hard to find out who this guy is
like i said somebody trained him
who trains the best
to rusty right
if hes not dead
stunned silence from the guys
they wont even respond
yen says something
isabel is waiting to be processed
eventually she is directed down a hallway
we look through a one way mirror into the interrogation room where detectives onderdonk and devenpeck are trying the bad cop bad cop routine on evelyn
isabel walks into frame and watches onderdonk slams his fist on the table
davenpeck shouts in evelyns face
evelyn just laughs
isabel shakes her head
frustrated and more exhausted than their detainee the two detectives leave the interrogation room for the ante room where isabel is
im not quitting
who said quitting
can i speak to him
the two detectives look at each other
who are you
isabel produces a signed document
they look at it shrug and give it back
apparently you can do whatever you want with him
are you moving him
i just need to speak with him
to get some information
weve been on him for six hours
with our best stuff
our best stuff
in mind terms weve been torturing this guy
i only need a moment then ill be out of your way
isabel goes into the room with evelyn
we stay with onderdonk and davenpeck who watch her through the two way mirror
through the mirror isabel walks right up to evelyn smiles and whispers one word to him her
evelyns face freezes
he she looks at isabel scared
then he she starts to weep
tears stream down his her face
isabel hands evelyn a sheet of paper and he she begins to write
onderdonk and davenpeck are dumbfounded
isabel turns around so shes facing them
the entire group minus danny sits around glumly watching cnn international on the flat screen
danny is on his cell phone on the other side of the room
its not a problem its a hiccup
it wont affect our schedule that much
i want to talk about you not the job
how are you doing
knock knock knock
something about it doesnt sound familiar
danny moves into the big roam
rusty is at the door looking through the peep hole
rusty puts his head down
clearly it isnt a stranger
tess ive got to call you back
he hangs up
knock knock knock
rusty indicates for danny to get it
danny opens the door to reveal isabel
she looks at danny
he looks back at her
they dont say a word
danny motions for her to come in
still glued to the tv who is it
to rusty hello robert
rusty spins to see isabel
he crosses to her
stay with the group for a moment
is that his real name
virgil and turk shrug
how does she know that
the entire group is watching them
its great to see you
because youve been seeing a lot of me lately
she hands a surveillance photo to rusty
you were sitting in a mercedes outside my apartment on wednesday night
she hands rusty another photo
these are the photos hess the male secretary showed her at europol hq that we couldnt see
you were hiding in the bushes when i had lunch yesterday at trattoria bella
she hands him a third photo
looks at the fourth
im not even sure where this one was taken but i like it a lot
very ron gallela
she hands this photo to danny
its a picture of rusty with a dorky look on his face peering out from behind a mailbox hes using as cover while he spies on isabel
i mean if i didnt know better id think you all came here to steal the vanderspeigle getuigschrift also known as the worlds first stock certificate
to the group as a whole you must have been so proud of yourselves
a schuman special
its been awhile
smiles at basher that was a very handsome crossbow shot eugene
basher winces at the sound of his real name
the group stares back at her
cant believe this is happening
and the palowski
whose idea was that
she knows it was rusty
we didnt steal anything
i know you didnt
somebody beat you to it
no back up
tell me something just so i can get the full picture in my head was he wearing a tuxedo
a white dinner jacket
to isabel at least we saw him in the flesh
youll never see this guy your whole life
so you know who he is
of course we know who he is
ill see you when you see him
to get your certificate back
she takes the photo of rusty peeking from behind the mailbox from dannys hand
she walks out
the group is frozen
livingston is still looking at the pictures of rusty following isabel
to rusty re the photo whos hat is that
how did she that was to rusty this is what i was talking about
this is exactly what i was talking i was just checking up on her
i knew she didnt want to see me
i was being polite
where did she learn all that stuff
the palowski stuff
he was a cop
was he good
whats the big deal
shes just some brilliant pissed off ex girlfriend whos dad taught her every trick in the book
but did you see that display of emotion handing out those pictures
her job is very stressful
she could reduce her stress by leaving us alone
weve got to slow her down
but first we find our french friend and introduce ourselves
isabel is talking to her superior
twenty four hours
you know that
i dont have twenty four hours
theyre there now
theyll lead me to him
you also know that you can go now if you dont take your secretary
when theres liability i need a document
he said we cant leave until tomorrow because of liability issues and he needs a document
thanks for trying
lets share a car
that would be nice
i cant believe they wont make an exception
beat ive got to find out who this other guy is
dinner jacket aka francois toulour wins a huge blackjack bet
the crowd reacts enthusiastically
a beautiful woman stands near him
the crowd around the blackjack table erupts as toulour wine another massive bet
note the same dealer pays him off
the same crowd is watching
but toulour is dressed in a different tuxedo and a different women is standing by his side
he did his first big job in
the fifteen million dollar one the day the berlin wall fell
he was nineteen years old
follow toulour in a different tuxedo with a different beautiful woman as he exits the casino
when we pick him up on the exterior he is in another tuxedo with another woman

how do you hide a two hundred foot yacht
if the king knows hes not telling
he received it back a month later
another beautiful woman
he pilots his convertible maserati at high speed along the windy road
how far is your house baron
twenty minutes by helicopter
one guy did all those jobs
howd he get all those aliases
until a month ago interpol were convinced that the heists were the work of twelve different people
but not any more
the french national police just gave him a nickname
le renard nuit the night fox
danny rolls his eyes
scotland yard said hes the new lemarc
scotland yard never saw lemarc
a helicopter lands on a massive lake como estate
toulour gets out
some say hes one of these guys that thinks because he was born in a penthouse he controls the elevator business
others say he turned out okay when you consider how rich his parents were
taxes over here are brutal
people dont realize
father was a big time industrialist got into the cellphone market on the ground floor
had maids as a child
hes a public figure people know who he is
hes been rumored to run for office in spain even though he doesnt appear to live there
toulour in new clothes with yet another woman unlocks several locks and disarms two alarms
the woman cant believe all the security he has
what do you have in there the mona lisa
as if please
doesnt miss a beat you know what
i dont like that painting either
i dont like anything van gogh did
toulour smiles and lets her in
hes an avid golfer pro level tennis player and inveterate gambler
but apparently his favorite pastime is
linus trails off
spit it out linus
a tableau shot looking into the bedroom
another beautiful woman joins toulour in his bedroom
hes rarely alone
i think its a compulsion
i have a list of names here
it was just the first week
all right moving on is there anything else we need to know about this guy before we did we forget to mention hes a viscount
as in nobility
cannot take it anymore last time i checked titles like that went out with a little number i like to call the french revolution spain
toulour crawls out of bad
wonders who the woman next to him is
he may be the greatest thief in europe
he may have slept with half of the eu
he may be a casanova with the soul of a starving artist
it doesnt matter
toulour comes downstairs in his bathrobe
theres something he cares about
theres something he cant live without
toulour reaches the base of the stairs and stops dead in his tracks
he looks ahead of him to a wall covered with paintings
one painting is clearly missing
all that remains are the dust fade marks on the wall to indicate that it had been there
he walks up to the wall and smiles certainly this will be an interesting day
hes actually been cheered up by this
toulour in playing a hard fought game of tennis
his opponent edmund bangs a great shot
toulour gets there and smacks it back
edmund dives for the ball just gets it back over the net
but toulour is waiting and hits a kill shot
are you on steroids
lets try again
give me five games this time
you are worse than sampras
you should be paying me
a butler arrives
in french pardon me sir
he hands toulour two business cards
one says daniel ocean the other rusty ryan
in french two gentlemen
they say they met you in amsterdam last week
in french put them on the veranda and get them a drink
ill be right up
danny and rusty look out over lake como
to danny rusty
toulour contd to rusty danny
other way around
are you sure
usually im so good at that
edmund arrives carrying his tennis bag
this is edmund
he calls by their wrong names again
nice to meet you
making conversation you a tennis pro
rusty takes a sip of ice tea
actually no im the king of morocco
danny and rusty nod their smiles frozen
toulour shows danny and rusty his art
sadly i cant show you my favorite painting of all a degas that used to hang right there because it was stolen recently
the criminal element is everywhere these days
call me baron
we came here for the vanderspeigle certificate thats not for sale
your degas is worth three times that
you want your painting back youre going to have to trade
you actually expect me to believe that you are in possession of my degas
you are living in a
in a bubble
toulour looks at them and walks away
rusty and danny stand with the rest of the group
he used the word amateur
rusty and danny nod reluctantly
you said we could show him the painting right to prove that we had it
he still wouldnt trade
yen says something
we need to teach him a lesson
all right lets stay calm
we dont need to over react here
he said some disrespectful things thats true
but why antagonize this guy
why get into something with him
hes young and hes filthy rich and hes got time on his hands
we dont want to become his betty noir
we can just fence his painting and earn a lot more than we would have from the certificate
its about reputation
you said so yourself
we have to get that certificate to evelyns buyer or well make enough selling the degas to pay off her buyer then why did you make that trip down there
in the first place if you didnt want to get into something
turn his name over to isabel
in exchange for getting off our backs
tough one to swallow
short of that
the only appropriate response is to steal his next job right out from under him
just like he did to us
we dont even know our next job
we got ten million in that closet
danny points at the closet in the room
i cash in the degas take a moment to think about our next move
toulour isnt going anywhere
you guys are hyping him too much youre letting him get inside your head
danny opens the closet
theres a picture frame in there but no picture
its been stolen by toulour
we hear the sound of a case being shut and locked
we see a small secure box being transported to a heavily secured truck
the truck exits the building and drives down a street with security motorcycles surrounding it
the motorcade heads for the private airport
the secure box is loaded onto a plane as isabel and her male secretary hess exit a plane nearby
isabel and hess heading into paris
why do i need to see all these guys
when i tracked the munch down in sweden i got all the approvals i needed with one phone call
isabel contd with lenins shaving kit the russians brought me in and it took a single signature and i got it at the airport a minute after i arrived
whats so goddamned special about the french
hess gives her a look as though she should know better
without their signatures you cant do anything
you cant pull the suspects over you cant do surveillance on them youre not even allowed to contact them
theyre real sticklers about sovereignty issues here
the bureaucrat looks at isabel
all of her
isabel i couldnt possibly sign those documents in good conscience without talking to you about the case in detail
i realize youre in a hurry and my schedule for the rest of the day is quite full so perhaps if youre interested in being expedient we could discuss the
isabel sits in the back with hess
foucquets at eight thirty
apparently theirs a private room
better bring your kevlar
to the driver dont stop for that
the driver accelerates through a yellow red light almost hitting danny and toulour who deftly avoid getting crushed
thats not how i want to go
they walk on
very theatrical of you
asking to meet here
like were spies meeting to do an exchange
why are you doing this to us
this is a game for you
for us its survival
are you that bored
i wouldnt do that
the truth is
i made a bet
or maybe a better word is a wager
what kind of wager
danny and toulour sit across from each other
the bottom quarter of the eifel tower is visible in the background
a gentlemens wager with a friend of mine my mentor
a few months ago we were at his winter place in nicaragua and another guest referred to me as the greatest thief in the world
i didnt object obviously but my mentor fell silent
later i asked him about it
he said if i really wanted to say i was the best thief
id have to prove i was better than the eleven of you
toulour contd you know the benedict job made waves even all the way over here
thats a lot of money
before you were found
yes million is a lot of money
it attracts attention
so in a way you brought this problem with me on yourselves
youre victims of your own success
heres what im going to do
you tell me the name of your mentor
ill call him up and ill tell him that youre the greatest thief in the world
that i accept that to be true
and in return
you leave us alone let us go about our business
how about that
he said youd probably say something like that but he said youd probably have your fingers crossed when you said it
danny frowns pulls his hand out of his pocket
so in this situation for the purposes of my wager words arent good enough
i have to prove this on the ground
this mentor of yours
was he a good thief in his day
angle on the group theyre slack jawed
yen says something
i thought so too
god hates me
he hates all of us
hell this could go on forever
its going to be settled by one more job
a single object
whatever it is lets just let him have it
because of pride
because we beat him hell pay benedict off
a stunned beat
new lease on life now were talking
one score for the whole thing
what do we have to do
i mean is it a fair bet or is it like
the coronation egg or something
thats the one
he wants us to steal the coronation egg
what is that
the holy grail
carl faberge the greatest goldsmith in history constructed the coronation egg in for the wedding of czar nicholas and alexandra
every world class thief in the last years has tried to steal it
no one has even come close
thats because its cursed
its un stealable
its the only thing in lemarcs entire career that he went after but failed to get
he tried three times
a long beat of silence
we get the egg and were free
thats great except we cant get it
its not possible
then we go to jail
where is it now
the small secure box is being taken off a plane
another motorcade forms and escorts the vehicle into the city
the motorcade is completely stopped in traffic
in a nearby sedan isabel sits next to an italian carabinieri liaison of same sort
hess is in the front seat
im going to need surveillance on both hotels phone taps room bugs people in the lobby and by every exit
if i had to guess id say ill need at least people a dozen vehicles
and an on call air unit
okay one more thing and this is crucial these guys are extremely sophisticated at avoiding electronic surveillance so well need real state of the art stuff
isabel contd im talking synthetic aperture pinhole cameras wave reformation mics with a high plank coefficient and a passive input structure youre not writing anything down are you sure youre
getting all this
now what time am i meeting captain giordano
no what time
isabel looks right at him
youve spoken with the pope and hes okay with autographing my breasts
hess turns around
isabel sighs loudly and sinks back into her seat
the motorcade arrives at the museum of modern art
we follow armored car and continue on to find danny walking up the front steps
angle on livingston as he subtly nods at something in the distance
danny is standing next to him
what am i looking at
a tr infra red motion detection system
its the gold standard
saul and linus back yet
and i cant find rusty
frank and yen look at an authorized entry only door as a member of the museum staff goes through it
the door has a complex double locking mechanism that would make it impossible to pick
yen says something in chinese
yen says something in chinese again
well i dont know but thats one nasty lock
we thought he was with you
danny moves off
basher is being questioned by danny
not since we first got here
about an hour ago
danny moves away
basher contd to dannys back and wheres saul and linus
isabel enters her room
suddenly she spins and draws her pistol
her gun ends up in rustys face
i couldve killed you
a long beat as she takes a look at him
i hope so
what are you doing in my room
i thought maybe we could get some coffee
okay how about a two week trip to zanzibar
fine coffee then
whatever you say
isabel gives an exasperated sigh
why do i want to have coffee with you
how should i know
sorry about your mom
rusty contd she was a real
she hated you
well she was nice enough to hide it from me
some people cant even do that
she hated everybody
youll never get it by the way
youll think youve got it youll be so close that youll be able to taste it and then this guy the night fox or whoever he is will just take
it right out of your hand just like he did in amsterdam
hes as good as lemarc
its not possible
youre in a bubble
rusty looks at her
a mock up of the room the egg will be displayed in
a dummy egg sits on a cradle in the center of the room
infra red motion detectors cover the room
motion sensitive lasers shine directly onto the egg
danny basher yen frank and livingston try to figure out how to get around the security systems
no that wont work either
the ir will pick it up before you even get close
this is depressing to everyone
look if were having this much trouble and weve got ten guys toulour must be pulling his hair out
toulour lies in a lounge chair
the group agrees toulour must be suffering like them
rusty strides in
everyone looks at him
he looks at the mock up of the egg
would you call that bubble shaped
rusty shrugs it off
she pulled a gun on me
rusty contd she wont back off
are you back on
she aint buying
more importantly what kind of reception is the italian police giving her
a subordinate officer leads isabel down a hallway
captain giordano is handling an urgent interrogation
hell be up as soon as it is completed
please wait in here
he leads isabel and hess into the captains office
a large clock on the wall reads am
the open windows in the office look out onto one of romes famous courtyards
captain giordano stands with three other officers
they are having a loud tense conversation in italian
isabel watches as giordanos temper really flares
he jabs his finger at one of the other cops
theyre a joke
the only decent player they have is pasqualli and hes a pussy
pasqualli runs circles around bolognas backfield every time
pasqualli could single handedly isabel turns to the officer who escorted her in
what are they talking about
its an internal matter madame
isabel and hess look at each other
the captain continues to argue
those involved in the discussion are being brought lunch
isabels sitting on the couch now her eye lids drooping
hess checks his pda
and her friends could trounce napies
the clock on the wall reads pm
isabels been here two and a half hours
livingston yen danny and rusty are experimenting with a way for yen to drop from the ceiling so that hes hanging right over the egg
their mock up alarm rings
a red light flashes
danny rubs his face
this is feeling impossible
he goes into the corner and clicks a walkie talkie
in the background we see rusty trying to keep everybodys spirits high
all right okay
lets not be defeatists
what about that mirror trick that akimbo tried at the theres no mirror thin enough to avoid tripping the lasers
in the foreground danny on the walkie talkie
whats he doing now
just reading the papers at a cafe
oh no wait
a woman just sat down next to him
hes getting her phone number
what are those
ive never seen that color
into walkie okay take it easy over there
saul and linus enter
linus puts his backpack down
we thought someone was following us
we gave em the shake
caught em napping
isabel is asleep on the couch
a hand taps her shoulder
she wakes up and is shocked to see captain giordano finally standing above her
doing the introductions captain giordano rome police special investigations
isabel lahiri europol major theft task force
the captain nods
isabel looks over at hess who is still asleep
isabel and the captain are alone now
giordano is looking right into her eyes with laser focus
there isnt even a hint of lasciviousness about him
hes all business
reason to believe these men
lays out photos of danny rusty and toulour are going to try to steal the coronation egg when it is actually put on display next week
i need official authorization to surveil and pursue these suspected criminals on italian soil
and ill need substantial resources from your department
can i count on that
starts to wonder
so captain what do you think of my skirt
he smiles and looks at her
i think its very beautiful
why dont you like it
danny and toulour
a waiter brings them coffee danny spoons in a lot of sugar then stirs
i dont usually call for a second date
for you i make an exception
i think its good that we talk
you see you should stop following me
youre wasting your time
im going to let you go first and get caught
then they will increase the security even more and then i will steal the egg
then lemarc can make his decision
you sound confident
this is a very american word
i am arrogant
theres a difference
doesnt matter if youre that good
are you that good
i can move objects with my mind
danny just looks at him
you dont believe it
are you done stirring your sugar
danny stops lifts the spoon
its completely bent
starts to go listen i appreciate the call and best of luck
sit down please
danny site down and looks at him
youre telekinetic is that what youre telling me
its a curse
everything is too easy
but then lemarc says im still not the best
so i take his challenge
and you will fail and i will win and so what
what does it prove
what is he trying to show me
danny just looks at him
lahiri youre in italy now
we are a sovereign nation
were not some adjunct some administrative district of the eu
when europol calls we dont jump up and tap dance for you
if you want to work in italy then you have to do it under italian authority
and that means you have to talk to commander andriotti
who im sure will be happy to meet with you some time next week next week
when he returns from vacation
isabel slumps back into her chair
stares up to the heavens
isabel and hess walk
he said he has to get approval from someone else and theyre on sick leave
sorry i fell asleep
we both did
an exasperated isabel tries to regain her equilibrium with a cappuccino
a piece of music comes over the cafe loudspeaker that catches isabels attention
a cheesy wavy screen years ago
isabels sitting at the very same cafe reading the newspaper when she hears frantic police whistles
she looks up to see a man running down the street at full bore
as he gets closer we realize its rusty
eight cops are chasing him
rusty rushes past the cafe
as he does he notices isabel they make eye contact
then hes gone
sprints around the corner
the cops rush past her
she hears sirens converging from all directions
isabel shows her europol identification to a detective
hi this isnt official business
actually im here on vacation
but i was sitting in a cafe this afternoon near the piazza navona and
the police were chasing someone on foot
i was just wondering if you caught him or
do you know anything about that case
i know the case yes
unfortunately we didnt catch him
isabel sits in the same seat the next day reading the newspaper enjoying her vacation
she looks up and stops cold
rusty all cleaned up now dressed in a perfectly tailored suit sits down three tables away from her
she stares at him
cant believe it
the audacity of this guy
rusty doesnt seem to have a care in the world as he chats easily with the waiter in italian
finally isabel just cant help herself
she gets up and walks over to rustys table
i think i saw you
the police were chasing you
you sure your eyes arent broken
im quite sure it was you
well then im not gonna argue
can i buy you a coffee
we transition back to the cafe
isabels phone rings
weve got to stop meeting like this
hes sitting at the table behind her
isabel and rusty are being quiet for the moment
the waiters in the midst of an animated discussion in italian with one of the customers
what are they talking about all the time
translating he doesnt like naples
thinks theyre a bunch of
turns to isabel can i ask you a question
off isabels nod will you come to zanzibar with me on friday
danny sleeps sitting up in a chair as the rest of the group tries to figure out how to defeat the security systems around their mock up egg
the group breaks into applause startling danny awake
we did it
what what happened
tight medium shot on uniformed national police officer as he strides down the hallway
his bearing is disciplined stern formal
he is clearly handling a matter of utmost importance
tilt down to reveal he is carrying a tiny cup of the national police officer blows through passing hess
isabel sits with commander andriotti
the office door swings open and the national police officer walks in
he places the cappuccino on andriottis desk and leaves
giordano sits with his feet up on his desk smoking a cigar
the door swings open and isabel strides in catching him completely off guard
she thrusts a piece of paper in his face
an order signed by commander andriotti instructing you to provide any and all support that agent lahiri requests whenever she requests it
he looks at it
its good yes
he looks at her
thats a very nice blouse you wear today
linus and the malloys walk through the museum
when dominique goes back with thomas to check the trunk the money shouldnt be in the briefcase
franklin should have double crossed them
that could be a great moment when hes on the ground
and you think thomas is going to get blown up
a large group of security people are talking to some new technicians and isabel
another camera here and here
and have a guard here at all times so any attempt to disable the system will be detected
all your ir devices need to be fitted with reflective faces otherwise a uv later can be used to burn the sensors out
the guys look glum
she just walked in there like patton or something
everything and there were so many cops with her
ive never seen so danny plats up his hand to stop him
i dont understand
if her father was a thief
whys she such a hardass
i mean youd think shed have a little sympathy for us
when she was twelve her mother told her that her dad got arrested doing a job in russia and died in jail
beat so i wouldnt count on much sympathy
this time its personal
danny looks to rusty who nods
fourteen police cars parked in front of it
isabel stands at a police checkpoint on the road in front of the museum chatting with captain giordano whos clearly brown nosing her big time since receiving andriottis order
her phone rings
she looks at the number and answers it
what do you want
ever heard of overkill
i dont even think toulour can get it now
if he gets it well let you arrest us
if we get it you come away with me to zanzibar what is your obsession with zanzibar
do you want to make the bet or not
im hanging up
stop calling me
isabel crosses to the elevators
shuts the door behind her
then instantly starts balling
danny and rusty stand with livingston
im telling you with everything shes done in the last twenty four hours
unless you happen to be best friends with the head of security at the museum unless you are someone he knows and trusts enough to leave alone in the gallery
after disabling about half of their security system forget it
we are not stealing that egg
someone he knows
someone he trusts
someone he knows
what about someone he doesnt know but trusts
im talking about you know who who looks an awful lot like you know who
everyone looks at danny
its not going to be easy getting her over here
tess walks down the street
she passes an alley where a utilities truck is raising a man in a bucket
she enters the department store
tess shops for perfume
the power twins watch her from a discreet distance
she smiles at them
then makes her way to the ladies room
she walks in and goes right for the window
shes about to open it when it opens from outside
she jumps a mile until she sees that bruiser is there standing in the bucket from the utilities company
just climb on through
try not to look down too much
four stories above an alleyway
tess climbs out the ladies room window into the cherry picker basket with bruisers help
tess climbs into a taxi cab
reuben in an anachronistic taxi drivers uniform is driving
theres make up in the bag there
and some photos
do the best you can
the hotel manager comes to the front desk to answer a call
we can have
i can make our presidential suite available
no no no
no trouble at all
were honored that shed think of us
he hangs up
turns elated to his front desk staff
julia roberts is coming to stay with us
tess as julia roberts steps out of a mercedes limo wearing sunglasses and carrying a puppy
frank and basher as nation of islam bodyguards clear a place in front of her
reuben trails dressed in the latest hip hop clothes
a throng of fans and paparazzi rush toward her
strobes blind us
fans scream out her name thrust paper and pen at her for autographs
its a frigging madhouse
why did you come back to rome so soon
was it to see topher
to see what
your co star
is that why youre here
i came to to see the
danny your husband
looks to reuben well hes not really ms
roberts is very tired
please let her through
tess enters and shuts the door behind her
she takes a deep breath and exhales
she looks up at danny whos there waiting for her
i cant do this
danny goes to her
when he steps back he answers yes you can
im not an actress danny
and i dont look like her
you do tess
you really do
i never told you that before but its true
come on my
she notions at her body but we cant tell what part
she motions at her body again again its totally ambiguous what part
and my ears
anybody who sees my ears is going to know instantly
nobodys looking at your ears
yes danny they are
theyre going to know
isabel stands with the museum director
when did that happen
we just found out
i arranged a private showing for tomorrow morning before we open the show to the public
i dont understand why do you have to disable any of the systems because she might want to get close to the egg got right up here and look at
and im not going to embarrass myself or this institution by telling her she cant
shes an actress giovanni not the pope
do you realize how much free publicity well get for this museum just because she because she decided to come by and look at the egg
shes even agreed to do a photo shoot for us promoting the museum
isabel gives an exasperated sigh
thats exactly the sort of thing
saul frank and rusty sit on plush couches and watch isabels conversation with the museum director from six different angles
clearly livingston has tapped into the museums closed circuit system
that the people im after will exploit
thinks okay fine
you want to shut down half the electronic system let me post eight cops in the room
saul frank and rusty clench teeth and fists
on pins and needles for a moment
if the museum director agrees theyre in big trouble
are you crazy
thats worse than
you want me to treat her like a criminal
the guys relax back into the couches their plan narrowly having escaped disaster
on saul frank and rusty relaxing
only this angle has a digital quality to it because we are watching them now through a hi def tv screen
pull back to reveal toulour sitting in a warehouse of his own watching his own surveillance footage of both our guys warehouse and the museums closed circuit system
look if you need to do something to reinforce security during her visit fine
but its got to be out of sight
and it cant effect julia in any way
are we clear
toulour eats with a beautiful woman
virgil sits six tables away keeping an eye on him
turk strolls in and sits with his brother
where is he
points at toulour there
i took a look at the interrogation scene
cause linus said it was repetitive
it clarifies everything
he said its too on the nose
whats he the head of the studio
whats he ever written
hes just saying oh no what
its not him
turk spine to see toulour get up at the other table
only its not toulour
its somebody who looks like toulour from behind
how did you you moron
you said you were watching him the whole time
i mean i used the bathroom once but it was quick
you lost him yesterday
they sit for a minute
livingston said frank said that rusty said that danny said toulour said dont ever bother following him
on rusty the blue light of an unseen television reflecting off his face
he walks onto the balcony
we follow rusty down a hallway
he enters a dark apartment
slips silently through the dining room
two places are set
a candle on the table is burned down to almost nothing
the lights are out here too
but isabels still awake
rusty enters the room
she doesnt look at him im sorry
i have to go
i have to leave the country
it could be a while
isabel turns to look at rusty
she can barely see the outline of his face in the darkness
what are you saying
what the hell are you saying
where are you going
i cant tell you
isabel stares at his dark face
when people start talking the way youre talking there are only two possibilities youre either in intelligence or youre a criminal
and no one i work with has ever worked with you
or even knows your name
you knew what i was the day you met me isabel
we can talk about it when i get back
i have to tell you something
what is it
im taking the job
im moving to amsterdam
he doesnt respond for a moment
i cant have this conversation right now
i have to get out of here
i love you
he kisses her then leaves
outside the front of the apartment he shuts the door and turns toward us
we see his face in the light for the first time his left eye is swollen shut
blood is caked into his hair and on his cheek
somebody beat the shit out of him
rusty is still on the balcony
theres a knock at the door
he opens it to see isabel
you want to walk
rusty and isabel sit on the steps of the campidoglio
i know how youre planning to do it
i know julias visit is the key
after a beat lemarc knew when to get out
he just quit
with his perfect record intact
now hes a legend
exhorting dont do this
lemarc quit because he was years old isabel
he was tired
his doctor told him if he didnt start taking it easy he was going to have another heart attack
youre dramatizing it
you dont know why lemarc retired any better than i do
you have no idea
actually i do
i know exactly why
he told me
skeptical as hell you know lemarc
ten years ago
for how long
for six months
you shes so mad she can hardly speak
you knew lemarc
you knew lemarc and never told me
thats the worst thing youve ever done to me
nobody knows more about lemarc than me
how could you do that
i couldnt tell you then
then why arent you as good as toulour
i dont want to arrest you robert
i really dont
but i will if you make me
i will if you go for that egg
rusty goes silent looks out at the lights of the city
so many times i waited
you cant do that to a person
isabel i have to go
isabel gets up
walks away fast
shes barely holding herself together
rusty watches her go
several seconds then rusty carries a huge bouquet of flowers up the stairs to the front door of his apartment with isabel
its a perfect sunny day outside
he unlocks the door quietly and swings it open to see the apartment is bare
the furniture is still there
but nothing else
nothing on the walls or the shelves
isabel has clearly moved out
rustys whole body reacts
he slowly looks around him as if in a dream
his eye goes to the dining room table
isabels engagement ring is there
rusty is still watching isabel small now in the distance
she turns the corner out of sight
isabel pulls up in her car
the egg is being put into position
reuben is talking to yen
frank and livingston get ready in the background
youre a photographer
you want things a certain way but you never raise your voice
reuben what are you doing
oh we understand each other
im mean the actual words are gibberish to me but i know what he means
theres a tone you know
im sure hed tell you the same thing
to yen am i right
yen says something in chinese
danny and the malloys are looking at tesss hair
i say we do a joey heatherton
its the wrong color
turk looks at his watch
theres a knock at the door
they let tess check on it
she looks out the keyhole
its topher grace
tess looks back to the group and shrugs
he knocks again
the group scrambles and hides
tess opens the door
i got your room number from mccormick i hope you dont mind
he walks in and hugs her
she looks terrified
topher disengages and looks around
this is great
do you have the adjoining room
i saw the rough cut of you always you never
its so awesome
it was just like a dub of a lo rez output but i could totally see what you were doing
i think you might win again
it really actually looked like you were blind
how did you do that
what is it like an on set thing or was it digital
it was uh
you can tell me i wont tell a soul
because if you say its instinctual im quitting right now
the way you parted your hair
that was so connected
and that scene with the matches
and when you find out who your real grandmother is and run through the rain and find her on the porch and touch her face
man that was
you gotta tell steven how much i loved it
so what are you doing
im uh getting ready to go out
laughs i mean next
what movie are you doing next
im having trouble deciding what to do next
is danny working
is something wrong
have you two
im so sorry
im so sorry
were absolutely fine hes just
ive got to stop asking people about their spouses its like always a mistake no really listen i wont say a word
im rooting for you guys you know that
this is your private business and i totally respect that
no more danny questions from me
hey cool whatever
thats what ill say
so can i come look at that egg with you
reuben dressed in a hip hop outfit and linus dressed like an agent stand in front of some paparazzi
a crowd of museum employees also rubberneck
my name is stuart feldman worldwide executive senior vice president of marketing corporate senior vice president of publicity and corporate international executive worldwide president of promotion for the warner brothers
motion picture company
indicating my colleague grant wells who is responsible for ms
roberts itinerary has graciously set aside time for ms
roberts to view the coronation egg privately
isabel the security director and captain giordano sit with four cops watching a bank of closed circuit screens
i want to be on record as saying that you should have shut the entire museum down
isabel keeps her eye on the tourists who circulate through the other wings of the museum
julia arrives flanked by her nation of islam guards frank and basher
the assembled employees clap and call her name
she waves as they take her picture
topher throws his arm around julia to make sure he gets in all the shots
the museum director comes up to greet julia
isabel watches the security camera feeds
isabel points at a screen showing the museums other entrance
rusty nonchalantly slips into the museum
julia enters and walks up to the egg
her entourage follows
its so beautiful
topher looks at the egg kinda small
he turns away to look a cute girl on the museum staff
she leans in close to the egg
im not going to set off any alarms
get as close as you like
reuben pops his head in between them
obsequious julia unless you have any objections wen and his crew set up for the publicity stills
rusty ponders a painting like college student trying to impress his art history professor
finally he moves on into another gallery
pan to reveal nine uniformed cops trailing behind him
yen enters frame dressed like a pretentious grunge rocker
he whispers chinese into a bullhorn
theoretically hes speaking to his crew danny saul and livingston in lame disguises telling them where to set up the camera lights and flags
each crew member carries an odd looking oversized light meter
upon closer examination we can see that each device has a small tv screen on it which is tapped into the museums closed circuit system
the guys are carefully placing their flags and lights so as to block the view of the egg from each of the eight cameras on the ceiling of the gallery
studio execs reuben and linus go to julia
i was thinking maybe we could get you and topher into some you always you never hats and t shirts for the shoot thats stupid
instant reversal so stupid
turns to linus as if its his idea idiot
gingerly maybe we could put some posters in the background i dont think we want to be so obvious i completely agree
to linus stop trying to turn this into some sort of stunt
isabel struts up to rusty
this isnt going to work
i dont know what youre talking about
yen stands on two apple boxes to shoot photos of julia and topher
julia looks ridiculously stiff and keeps putting her hands up to block her ears
topher keeps shooting glances at danny who is moving around flags and lights ostensibly in accordance with yens chinese language orders
julia sees tophers expression he recognizes danny from somewhere
okay thanks everybody
thank you so much
she starts to walk out
topher shrugs and follows her
julia and her entourage barrel down the hallway
topher catches up
hey j ro why the quick exit
uh i have to take some pills
i get headaches
yeah well with everything thing youve been going through i can see how youd need something
theyre just aspirin
ive never taken aspirin in my life ever
can you believe that
for me its like a control thing
well with aspirin
its very beneficial
they are interrupted by the sound of piercing sirens and clanging bells all manner of alarms coming from the gallery containing the egg
tess rushes back to the gallery just in time to see police officers pin danny and his entire crew on the floor and against walls and start handcuffing them
her bodyguards frank and basher grab her and move her quickly out of the area
three massive ford excursion suvs with diplomatic plates double park out front completely blocking the flow of traffic on the narrow street
eight fbi agents climb out of their behemoths and walk inside like they own the place
the boss is a year old agent named molly starr
molly starr steps inside with her posse
she pulls out her badge and hangs it around her neck
whos in charge
isabel and captain giordano look at her and her team with obvious trepidation
tentative i am
smelling trouble she is
molly gives a slight nod to one of her lackeys
he thrusts an official looking paper at isabel
molly swaggers down a hallway followed by isabel and giordano
she stops at an observation window and looks through it to see danny who is handcuffed to a chair awaiting interrogation
his expression is impassive
she moves on to the next window yen
same impassive expression
she continues down the line reuben livingston and saul
each has the same impassive expression
through the final window she sees linus
hes nervously tapping his foot
molly smiles sadistically
ill start with him
molly sits face to face with linus
isabel and captain giordano stand in the corner and observe
when people think of italy they think of food wine the renaissance
they dont realize italy has the scariest prisons in the civilized world
you know why
theyre all leftover from the middle ages
theyre worse than dirty theyre damp
theyre like caves
linus cant look her in the eye
agent molly starr contd im the only hope youve got
what do you want
testify against the others in the benedict case
i cant do that
sure you can
youll get a year maybe two
the italian charges will be dropped
you and the others will be extradited to the us this afternoon
a long beat
think about those prisons
think about living there for twenty years getting out when youre fifty
what a catch youll be
linus is bundled into the back of the suv
agent starr gets in next to him
she motions to the driver
they pull out
agent starrs suv is followed by three other suvs and escorted by two rome police cars
linus stares morosely at the headrest in front of him
a long long beat
then he turns to agent starr did you tell dad
before agent starr answers the agent in the passenger seat turns around
its clint eastwood
of course she did
were married for gods sake
a key sounds in the door and she is on her feet
she reaches danny before hes all the way in the room
she kisses him then remembers shes mad at him
why didnt you tell me
because youre not an actress
you wouldnt have been so real
i thought you were going to jail
im not going to jail
so you dont think im a good actress
youre a terrible liar
im a good liar
where did benedict find you
at your parents house
okay so im not a good liar
youre good enough for both of us
the motorcade of fbi suvs pulls through the security gate and drives toward a us government gulfstream parked on the flight line
isabel watches with captain giordino and commander andriotti
linus saul yen livingston and reuben get out of the suvs all of them beaming
they hug linuss mom and dad and mount the steps to the plane
then rusty gets out says goodbye to everyone and heads for isabel
eyes go wide what the oh my god
isabel contd spins to giordano call the tower
dont let that plane take off
giordano stares blankly at her
but he doesnt move
isabel contd do something
do you realize whats happening
do you understand whats going on
deadpan yes absolutely
it takes a second to hit her
get on there before they leave without you
speaking like an american hey no problem
good seeing you man
see you back home
isabel is dumbstruck
toulour pulls up in a ferrari
his butler gets the door for him
how was rome air
toulour answers by handing a small velvet bag to his butler a bag just big enough to hold the coronation egg
put this in the safe would you
of course sir
your guests are on the veranda
isabel watches as the us government gulfstream containing all the members of rustys crew that she arrested at the museum taxis down the runway and becomes airborne
she turns to rusty
i hate you
i love you
this will ruin me
no it wont
not if you come to zanzibar
what is it with zanzibar
its where lemarc is
rusty points nearby at another private plane
the pilot has just opened the door and put the stairs down
that ones ours
we can be there in three hours
dont you want to meet him
he wants to meet you
youre asking me to turn my back on my whole life
would you miss it
im a cop
thats who i am
youre only a cop because your father was a thief
who died in a russian jail
according to you mother
what does that mean
it means you should meet lemarc
toulour walks out to find danny and tess chomping on gourmet nuts and sipping his special reserve brandy
to danny let me guess you decided you did want to give my lawyer a call
but you lost his card
toulour holds out another card to danny
no nothing like that
we just came to collect our money
not only did you fail half of your crew got pinched
your plan was not good
to tess and you dont look anything like julia roberts
i mean your
motions ambiguously to her body and your
another ambiguous motion and your ears
danny and tess just look at him
something about their demeanor is troubling
namely that they look completely untroubled
you stole it on the way to rome didnt you
i stole a replica
a repeat of the shot of the small secure box being taken to a truck
the truck moves out of the garage and on to the street as before
this time the shot continues over to a door on the side of the building
a young kid emerges with a backpack over his shoulder
the backpack kid passes another guy a normal looking guy who after a beat follows backpack kid
the backpack kid followed by normal looking guy walk through the terminal and get in line
we swing over to see normal looking guy looking at them
we start on the backpack kid who is reading a book
the backpack is beneath his legs
next to him sits linus
across from him is one of the normal looking guys
the other normal looking guy is a row away facing him
linus looks at the door of the car
is making his way through the door
he looks drunk
looks down at his copy of the french fhm
gets close and closer to linus and the backpack kid
puts his magazine away
is almost to linuss row he stumbles a little almost falls
then with a loud whoosh the train goes completely dark
its gone into a tunnel
we hear sauls voice cry out
in a few seconds the train exits the tunnel and the lights come back on
has fallen into the lap of the backpack kid
linus and the normal looking guy try to help him up
he stumbles onward and collapses into a vacant seat
in french hes completely drunk
the backpack kid nods his head
linus goes back to his book
we drop down to see his backpack also beneath his feet
linus walks through the terminal backpack over his shoulder
suddenly he stops and kneels to tie his shoelace
saul seeing this and reacting splits off into another direction
linus and saul approach the group
linus puts his backpack down
we thought someone was following us
but that means you knew what to steal before lemarc proposed that i challenge you for it
the image from the beginning of the film with rusty watching the boiling cask
hes talking on the phone
gaspar its rusty
how are you
and this time we see what be is working on in the warehouse in nyc we see danny and rusty arguing but from a different angle
they are smiling as they yell lemarc told you
he looks deflated
its probably just occurring to him that hes never lost before
he sits down
to teach me
he is silent
tess indicates to danny that they should leave
danny nods and they rise
well well be in touch to make all the arrangements
toulour gets up
you are my guests
i will celebrate your victory
besides you may have noticed i dont like to be alone
they are toasting champagne
i am feeling more french by the minute
to my first depression
saul and basher ride to the airport
so i think if you really analyze it you can see that its inevitable
its time for us to evolve en masse
i have to help bring that about whatever way i can you know
otherwise the trajectory is fixed
you know what im saying
but im through evolving i think
its too tiring
i feel pretty evolved
you know considering
frank and yen buy magazines
yen has a copy of an italian tabloid
the headline screams co star says julia marriage in trouble
a sub headline reads her addiction to painkillers is
in first class
basher and saul tip champagne glasses
virgil turk and linus all crack open copies of their story to read
ive got an idea for another dominique story
can we finish this one first
just let me tell it to you
its like three sentences
im serious youre asking too much
virgil puts on his headset
turk leans over to linus and begins to speak
linus reading holds his finger up
yen reads a magazine
reuben glances at it
may i look at that when youre through with it
yen says something
it would seem he is okay with that
livingston speaks into his voice recorder
trying to be dispassionate all in all it was depressingly familiar
the forced camaraderie the hollow smiles
scared to take a moments reflection
scared to imagine a different life
we behaved like boys
beat he chokes but
he begins to weep quietly but very quickly regains his composure
im livingston dell
thanks for listening
tess and danny enjoy the sunrise
when do you want to go back
feel like traveling
toulour enters with the last beautiful woman in tow
this is monica bellucci
and indeed it is
were thinking of taking a trip to the states
take a look around
wed love to meet some of your friends while were there
actually one friend in particular
we follow the gulfstream jet
isabel looks out the window
rusty watches her she looks over at him then back out the window
rusty and isabel pull up
he takes her hand and leads her inside
rusty and isabel walk through the house
there he is
rusty indicates the back porch
a figure sits in a lounge chair reading a book
this is lemarc
rusty contd gaspar
that was my fa isabel looks to the porch just as le marc her father turns to face her
she goes to him and they embrace
isabel contd daddy
lemarc looks to rusty
rusty salutes makes a drinking gesture and heads for the kitchen
the sound of a jet takes us to as we rotate from toulours villa to las vegas nevada
of the bellagio hotel
for a wire transfer of
into the account of tb enterprises
description repayment of personal loan
staring at this receipt
he looks up
is opposite him
they are both being served for lunch by a jacketed waiter whose face is continually obscured
thats the exact figure im pretty sure
so were clean
you want it in writing
ill take your word
these grudges theyre awful
as soon as someone retaliates the situation is out of control
this way theres no need for retaliation
why would there be
theres plenty for everyone
more than plenty
its just a matter of sharing
sharing is good
can i get sparkling water
its good for my acid reflux
off of course
the waiter turns toward the bar and we see now that he is francois toulour
