written by rian johnson production draft a pocket watch
swinging from a chain
held by a young man named joe in a clearing beside a kansas corn field
sky pregnant with rain
he checks the watch removes his earbud headphones stands
without much ceremony a bloodied man in a suit appears from thin air kneeling before the young man
hands and feet tied
burlap sack over his head
muffled screams gagged
with no hesitation joe raises a squat gun and blows the man apart with a single cough of a shot
joe loads the corpse into the flatbed of his truck
cuts open the back of the bodys jacket revealing four bars of gold taped to the dead mans back
joe takes them
massive in the middle of nowhere
time travel has not yet been invented
but twenty five years from now it will be
once the technology exists it will be relatively cheap and available to the public at large
it will be instantly outlawed used only in secret by the largest criminal organizations
and then only for a very specific purpose
joe drives up and parks his truck removes the wrapped corpse from the flatbed
its nearly impossible to dispose of a body in the future
tagging techniques whatnot
so when these future criminal organizations in the future need someone gone they use specialized assassins in our present called loopers
cavernous and empty
joe carries the body to an iron hatch opens it and dumps him in
thirty years from now
my employers in the future nab the target they zap him back to me their looper
and i do the necessaries
so the target has vanished from the future and ive just disposed of a body that technically does not exist
the body slides down a long chute
vanishes in a little flare of angry red fire
a sidecar roadside diner in the middle of nowhere
joes truck in front
nearly empty joe at a booth listening to headphones
a waitress sets down coffee
her bright red name tag beatrix
bon jour joe
bon jour beatrix
hows the french
hows the coffee
cream in the coffee
white clouds boil deep down
joes truck zooms from the flat fields towards a mid sized city on the horizon
grungy heavily fortified
joe enters and puts his gun in a basket labeled aloopers blunderbussesa slips down a narrow passage which ends at a steel wall with a protruding duct taped camera and
joe fishes the two gold bars from his jacket
a small narrow slot slides open in the wall and gnarled old hands take the gold bars
it slides shut again
in the background the front door to the pawn shop dings open
the slot slides open and jedds hands push a wad of cash
joe pockets it and backs around dale another looper
be at the belle tonight
dale hands four gold bars through the slot as joe retrieves his gun and exits
high ceilings big clean windows overlooking a sooty city
joe finishes smoothing out an oriental rug and scoots a coffee table in place over it
puts a bebop lp on a turntable
on the bed shooting at the ceiling with his fingers
bon jour mademoiselle
suit and tie joe pulls a tarp off a cherried out mazda miata
lingers over it
joe drives through the sooty city streets
a muted beep and he fishes a matchbook sized screen from his pocket
a young looper named seth on the side of the road kneeling beside a motorcycle without wheels called a slat bike
he kicks it in frustration
a vagrant approaches and seth pulls a gun identical to joes
around im not kidding
wide around ya shit
the vagrant crosses the street
joe pulls up
seth kicks the bike
you going to the belle
seth and joe
slat bikes are all junk
stick with rubber on the road
yeah but gat men pull up in them they get respect
they get respect cause they run the town
how much did that thing set you back
seth holds a quarter idly in his palm
i was gonna pull up in it
heads or tails call it in the air
the coin lifts floats several inches in the air quivering
youre pulling up with me instead
joe notices the floating quarter
and dont if were going in dont do that
chicks dig tks
its tacky dont do it
seth catches the quarter sullen
when the tk mutation started appearing in the general populace it was on every magazine anext step in evolution whats next
a everyone got tested
but turns out this was it and now its just a bunch of assholes thinking theyre blowing your mind by floating quarters
a shitty but bright nightclub in the heart of the city
flashy people shiver behind a velvet rope huge black cars big rollers in odd suits swept in by the bouncers
all trying very hard to be big time
drives past revving the engine
down the street
joe tosses the keys to an attendant
a dingy stage door in back of the building
joe and seth ring a buzzer smile for a camera and the door opens
a long dark hallway leads to a tiny antechamber with a coat check room used for guns
big craig leans out of it and stops the two
no loopers in the club on wednesdays joe
gat men only
seth backs towards the door joe stops him
well stick backstage just meeting up
in and out
packing your blunderbusses
im with joe
big craig pats them down waves them in
a claustrophobic maze of twisty halls and passages
dangerous men and half naked show girls weave through
joe expertly navigates the turns going someplace
seth struggles to keep up
so are we hey joe has vanished
seth stops meekly butted by passing men
an ornate parlor lacy women entertaining men
a velvet curtained doorway leads to back rooms
joe lingers by the entrance watching one girl in particular suzie
bold dark eye makeup
a big man leads her off through the curtains
joes eyes drop
a fat madame doesnt look up from her ledger
no loopers on wednesday joe
gat men only
so ive read
he ducks out
dale the looper from the pawn shop passes fast
curious joe follows
they pass seth who tails after them
cuz what joe
and seth loses them again butted back by passing men
a starkly lit steep stairwell leads down
five or six young loopers gather at the top
joe and dale join them
in there right now with abe
dale makes a quarter float above his palm
joe rolls his eyes
he closed his loop
this lands heavily on joe
the door at the bottom of the stairs opens and zach another looper steps out
an older mans hand pats his shoulder then retracts into the door
the loopers watch him in awe
theres a reason were called loopers
zach stands waiting checking his wristwatch gun in hand
obviously performing a similar ritual to joes
time travel in the future is so illegal that when we sign up for this job we agree to a very specific proviso
zach raises his gun
if our employers in the future get busted up by the law their first priority is going to be erasing any trace of their relationship with us ever existing
a flash of light and a hog tied man with a sack over his head kneels in front of zach
zach fires and the mans chest explodes
if theyre busted and if were still alive years from now theyll find our older self and zap him back to us like any other job
zach rips open the back of the corpses jacket revealing several dozen gold bars taped to his back
this is called closing your loop
looks at the shape of the corpses face through the sack
and you get paid out a mythic amount of money and you get a handshake and get released from your contract
enjoy the next years
zach reaches the top of the stairs a grin on his face
this job doesnt tend to attract the most forward thinking people
so are we celebrating
at the bottom of the stairs a skinny young thug in ratty jeans
this is kid blue
no loopers on fucking wednesdays
the loopers collectively flip him off
suck one kid
lurid and very loud mixture of a dance club and cabaret
one by one the loopers emerge from side exits sneaking in
paupers at the feast
joe and several other loopers pass around an eye dropper
the drug spins him into a slurred revelry
joe staggers out on the dance floor
joe and the loopers are kicked out by burly gat men followed by kid blue pointing and yelling at them
the loopers laugh their asses off
joes miata screams through the abandoned city streets racing with several other loopers in trucks and sports cars
jammed with seth and loopers joe at the wheel
still so high
suddenly one of the loopers shouts joe slams the screaming to a halt just shy of a malnourished beggar kid
caught in the headlights
behind him a miserable vagrant village in a field
joe stares at the kid frozen
then spins the wheel peels out
the loopers hoot and shout
joes miata screams along the dirt road bordering the vagrant village whizzing past open fires and dirty huddled families
joes face serene and focused
joe drops seth off at his building with its bright red garage
sell that goddamn slat bike back
thats a lot of stupid money
i got stupid money
seth holds his hand under fuzzy dice hanging from joes mirror and they spin
seth stumbles toward his door checks his pants
i think i did something
you know what
tks are special
seth slumps against the car
whats his payout
thats not going to last you years
and it wont get you overseas
so in five ten years youre back to riding the rails or worse youre like kid blue working as a gat man wagging your dick at loopers and roughing up
shop clerks for payoff money
fuckin kid blue
save a little something
cause thatll be yours and then youve got yours and thats all that matters your life is your own
i gots mine you gots yours
i wish i was smart like you
seth pats joes cheek and waddles off towards his apartment
an alarm wakes joe red eyed
in his bathrobe joe checks his apartment mailbox
a slip of folded paper inside with a a handwritten on it
dressed now joe double checks his french book for a phrase and heads out
joes truck zooms away from the city into corn fields
joes pocket watch at ticking away
a hog tied man with a sack on his head appears before joe
shoots the man in the chest without hesitation
joe sits at a booth the waitress beatrix brings his coffee
bon jour joe
ravi de te voir beatrix
ooh la la
jedd s and knarled sits in a tiny closet of a work room
following a buzz joe appears on a fuzzy monitor standing in the hall
jedd opens a slot and takes two gold bars from joe then hands him out a small stack of cash
marks in a notebook joes name the date and the number a
all the other transactions have the number a
joe smooths out the oriental rug
joe drinks with dale watches a group of loopers celebrating at another table
whats that fourth loop closed this month
dale casually makes a fork float above his palm lifting his eyebrows at passing ladies
on the stage flinging her legs with a line of can can dancers is suzie
the girl joe watched in the bordello
as her dance ends joe stands and goes backstage
suzie weaves towards her dressing room
joe catches her
you working a shift tonight
yeah but one of the gat men bought me out already
for the night
i gotta work
she leaves him watching her go
he turns sees kid blue leaning in the shadows
hes seen this whole exchange
the kid smirks
joe bursts back into the club with a vengeance
joe staggers in
not doing so hot
looks at himself in the mirror
eyes red as candy
he pops open a hidden drawer next to his medicine cabinet pulls out an eye dropper and puts one in each
a harsh pounding
joe flopped on the bed stirs
then wakes with a jump shaky on his feet
goes to the door
a screen shows nobody in the hall outside
still punch drunk joe listens
pound pound pound
joe slides it open
seth tumbles in off the fire escape
theyre gonna be here any minute are they here
no theyre not here
joes eyes focus a bit he tunes in to the situation
turns the apartment lights off
re the lights what are you doing
seth sit down here
seth knocks something over in the dark
joe opens the fridge pale light
seth sits at the kitchen table
late to my own funeral
mom always said
tell me now
late to my own goddamn funeral
can you help me
seth what did you do
you can protect me a little right
just so they dont
this is like a nightmare
this is a nightmare
i knew then what he did so i dont know why i asked
what did you do
seth lifts his eyes to joe
he was singing
flash a hog tied man with a sack over his head appears
seth with his gun raised hesitates
through the gag and mask but i could hear the tune
deep memories my mom in a dark room singing
back warm and safe when i coulda still been good
and once i knew it was him
joe i couldnt
i had to see
seth pulls the sack off the mans head
joe i cant even tell you
looking in his eyes
i had to let him talk then
i dont even remember the words but i remember believing every one of them or not even believing but submitting
ive never felt that small before
ive never felt that happy
he told me
i remember theres a new holy terror boss man in the future and hes closing all the loops
the rainmaker they call him
he told me
then he wanted a cigarette and i untied him and he gives me this look
and he just starts running
seth standing with his gun in his limp arm receding behind us as we run away
and i had my blunderbuss so i know hes got about fifteen strides till hes out of my range
and they come and go and i just watch him till hes gone
seth breaks down crying
this is called letting your loop run
its not a good thing
what do i do
youre the only friend i got joe you gotta help me you fucking idiot coming here
seth sucker punched
you cant be here ill give you a little money but you gotta joe
a little where am i gonna you hop a freight train you beat it the hell out pound pound pound
on the door this time
seth makes a sound like hes going to die joe closes the fridge hisses shut up
goes to the door
two gat men and kid blue stand outside
open up joe
to the gat man watch the window
joe spins from the door
i cant do anything for you seth
seth crumples to his knees grasping joes hand
you gotta hide me
joe hide me please christ please joe please hide me tell em something to buy time and ill leave please hold on
watching seth joes face breaks in a moment of decision
he flips the lights on and briskly pulls back his oriental rug
a floor safe with a touch pad
he enters a code opens it
wide and deeper than youd expect lined with gold bars
big enough for a man
seth scrambles in
joe takes one last look at seths frightened grateful face framed by the gold bars then closes the safe and smooths the oriental rug
pound pound pound joe opens the door
kid blue storms in his gun drawn sweeping through the apartment with over eager purpose
one gat man stays outside the other casually sits at joes kitchen table
kid blue gets in joes face
that took awhile
you think its easy looking this good
tyes going to watch your apartment while we go have a talk with abe
joe grabs a jacket
theres coffee in the tin
kid blue leads joe down the stairs and into the door at their base
dingy with a few benches
in one wall three steep stairs lead to a high door
kid blue knocks
muffled voice from two minutes
joe and kid blue on benches facing each other
the kid stares daggers and spins his gun
joe tries his best not to engage
you know why they call that pea shooter a blunderbuss
cuz its impossible to hit anything farther than feet and impossible to miss anything closer
a gun for fuck up turkeys
not like a gat
a gat has range
his gun spinning gets fancier
his gun meaner looking than joes blunderbuss long and slim and chrome
alright cut it out kid
youre gonna blow your foot off again
the kid almost snaps back but then grins
youre right itd be real easy for it to accidentally go off
he clicks the safety off
joe shifts uncomfortably
dont disrespect a gat man looper
joe stifles a chuckle
in a flash the kid stands and pistol whips him across the face
joe falls back
the kid raises his gun at joe
frozen in that tableau a moment the kid savors his victory
lowers his gun
what the hell is going on out there the high door swings open fast smacking kid blue hard on the side of the head
his gun goes off firing into the wall
out of nowhere three gat men burst into the room guns drawn
abe a sallow man in his s appears in the high doorway
humiliated the kid tries to stand but falls over again
after a moment everyone realizes whats happened and the tension breaks
joe climbs into the doorway
kid blue stands shakily
you didnt shoot your other foot off didja kid
the door closes and the gat men laugh at the kid
cluttered with a big desk
joe sits abe hands him a handkerchief for the ugly gash on his cheek
my great grandfather always told my grandfather mens like spiders
its the little ones you gotta be careful of
dunno i agree with that
what the fuck did my great grandfather know
this man is from the future
he was sent back here by the mob a one way ticket to run the loopers
thats low effort even for abe so to pass the time he recruited some real muscle the gat men
now he runs the city
any other city thatd be impressive
abe settles in his chair
how can you kids stand those chokers
this the cravats
youre aware we dont have a dress code
you know you dont know the movies youre dressing like were copying other movies
goddamn th century affectations do something new
put a glowing thing around your neck or use
waves at joes suit be new
a beat of silence
well it was nice chatting with you abe
i do like you joe
but were sure enough seth paid you a visit were gonna hafta do something about this
youre expecting were gonna break your fingers with a hammer or something awful and im going to diffuse that tension right now that isnt going to happen
whats going to happen is im going to talk for a little not even that long then youre gonna give up your friend
my friend seth
well then ill talk a little
you know you were the youngest looper i ever hired
you looked goddamn ridiculous they said the blunderbuss up to here on you
but i remember they brought you in i forget what it was for watch shop
thats yeah you had rolled one of our fronts a watch shop
and they had you your arms pinned this kid
like an animal
but you looked at me your hair stuck to half your face so just this one eye looking at me
and i thought whats this kid lived through what he had taken away from him
whats he lost
and i could see like seeing it happen clear as seeing it the bad path in front of you the bad version of your life
like a vision i saw it happen you turning bad
so i cleaned you up and put a gun in your hand
i gave you something that was yours
you know im grateful abe
but abe shakes his hands not where hes going
i gave you something that was yours
and i remember that kid and i think when you ask yourself you ask who would i sacrifice for whats mine i think seth is deep and cozy inside that
both their eyes go to a hammer sitting on the desk
that hammers there for something else later thats not its a bad coincidence
show you how much i know you im not even gonna break you just set you back a ways
we know youve been stashing half your bars
which is smart
you give up seth or you give us half your stash
joe holds abes gaze for a moment then his eyes drop and its over
will you kill him
would be too cataclysmic a change to the future
what well do is dangerous in that regard but not as dangerous as killing him and not by twice as having him run free
joe i let him run more than a few days the boys in the future get nervous then bing
my replacement shows up
with a gun
so well do what we have to do
floor safe beneath the rug
one of the gat men quietly exits
its the little ones that get you
abe leads joe out past gat men and kid blue smirking again
why dont you kill an hour joe
on the house
after joe exits abe and kid exchange looks
call the doc
joe slumps in
several girls none of them suzie
suzies just getting off
doubt shes up for it
he pushes through the velvet curtained door
a large gat man pushes past joe
at the end of the hall suzie leans in a doorway smoking a cigarette
not sexy just tired
she sees joe and is about to say no
but she sees joes eyes and doesnt
exhaling a plume of smoke she withdraws into her doorway
through her smoke
suzie naked at the mirror
she goes to joe lying on the bed distant
i cant remember my mothers face
i remember her touching my hair
he takes suzies hand strokes it over his hair
she smiles briefly tired then takes her hand away and puts drops in his eyes
do you want to go overseas
do i want to go overseas
baby thats sweet
youre a sweet boy
you gotta be careful its easy to think you know someone once you been like this
whats in here is services rendered
is that how it aughta be
what in nature
you know i get this a lot
especially young guys
i must have wife eyes or something
his face clouds
joe gets home
everything in place
he goes to the rug pulls it aside
opens the safe
all the gold and nothing else
one bar juts from the side knocked out of place
he pushes it back and when he lifts his fingers they have a bright smear of fresh red blood
a hunched figure sprints through an abandoned lot towards a train yard
it is a year old seth
he limps up to a razor wire fence bordering the train yard
surveys the sharp wire rips the lining from his jacket and wraps first his left hand then his right
on the palm of his right hand a weathered scar
clearly carved in the shape of an arrow pointing down to his wrist
old seth squints at it confused
he pulls back his sleeve revealing his clean bare forearm
then his face changes
because his arm is no longer bare
suddenly out of nowhere more intricate scarring has appeared down its length
the scars spell out clearly abe at wire street in old seths breath returns jagged
he pulls his sleeve up and hoists himself up the fence climbing fast
he reaches the top gets a good grasp on the wire to hoist himself over
and stops again
his right hand is missing a finger
the ring finger is just gone its stump worn with age
old seth stares
and now his middle finger is gone as well
a freight train whistle moans
the cars open and inviting leading out of town
behind him the city
terror and indecision seizes his chest so much so that it takes a moment for him to realize the sound of his breathing has changed to a ragged whistle
he lifts his hand now with just two fingers to his face
and the smooth scarred hole where his nose used to be
the train yard far in the distance
old seth running back into town
he looks down at his right hand fingerless now but for his thumb
he speeds up desperate
cuts through an alley
and has no right hand just a stump
no no no no no
a bell like ding
old seth spins sees a wedding band lying on the sidewalk
he picks it up with the four remaining fingers on his left hand stuffs it in his pocket sobbing
bursts out of the alleyway limping now straight into the street and into the headlights of an oncoming car
the car screeches to a halt and its harsh white light shows old seths missing right ear and deep scars down his face
old seth throws open the drivers side door and throws out the driver
jams on the gas
speeding through the streets hands slipping on the wheel
his pant leg crumples
empty boot tangling with the pedals
the car hits a pole
out climbs whats left of old seth his face mangled missing a foot one arm gone to the elbow
street sign wire street
howling missing his tongue
arm totally gone
then falls as his leg goes to the knees
and hes crawling an animal form bellowing wordlessly
makes it to an iron street side door
and with his one arm slams it
slumps against it heaving
after a long moment it swings open
with no hesitation a blast from the darkened doorway and old seths head mists open
he slumps to the pavement
kid blue steps from the doorway drags the body inside
deep in the dark doorway we glimpse a doctor in a surgical frock smeared with bright red blood
the door slams
joe wakes with a start
joes pocket watch at ticking away
he takes his stance
earbud headphones the drone of french lessons
a hog tied man with a sack on his head appears kneeling before joe
joe raises his gun without hesitation and shoots the man in the chest
walks to the body flips it
the mans hands tied and purplish
puts his hand next to them
he flips the man onto his back stares long and hard at the shape of the mans face under the cloth sack
tears it off
an older asian mans face frozen in terror
joe smirks the spell broken
his face hardens
joe watches the asian mans body slide down the hatch and vanish in a puff of distant fire
joe in the club drinking watching more loopers celebrate
joe in the field he shoots a hog tied man
joe in his floor safe setting more gold bars
joe in the field bang
joe in the club watching suzie with her red hair
joe in the field bang
in the plant a body sliding into the fire
joe in the field bang
his face more determined with each shot
our montage comes to an end suddenly and all is silent
joe in the corn field in his stance ready to draw
but nothing happens
joe checks his watch confused
watching the blank space where the man is supposed to appear
hand on his gun
something is wrong
then there he is
on his side so he flops over and has to straighten himself
the mans hands are untied
joe raises his gun scared
finger tightens on the trigger
then he sees the man has no sack on his head
and the face that stares back at joe is his own
year old joe
his eyes fixed on joe
and for just one split second joes face slackens and his finger eases on the trigger
its all the hesitation old joe needs
he throws his body into a spin
joe snaps out of it and pulls the trigger
the shot catches old joe square in the back and the impact blows him forward
but instead of blood beneath his torn jackets back we see the layered gold bars spill out
they caught the blast
in what seems like one fluid motion old joes fingers grab one of the bars he spins again throwing handfuls of dirt and the bar back towards joe
joe flinches again just for a moment and when his eyes focus again and his arm steadies the gun its too late
old joe is on top of him with a heavy blow knocking the gun aside and with an even heavier one swinging down on joes head a fist and then
blood caked on his face
headphones beside him still squawking french lessons
gold bars scattered in the dirt
but no old joe
and no truck
joe staggers to his feet shaky
late to my own funeral
joe runs shaky towards town
fishes his phone device from his pocket chucks it
across the street joe huddles behind a car breathing hard
looks up at his lit window
joe walks silently towards his apartment door
it is ajar
knows he shouldnt
holding his breath joe edges in
its ravaged torn to pieces
the floor safe is open about half the gold bars missing
but the apartment seems empty
exhaling joe works quickly
knocks a tile aside pulls a wad of cash from the wall
a heavy jacket from the closet
eyes dart around the room what else
but too late footsteps in the hallway
joe ducks into the bathroom just as kid blue and a tall gat man enter the apartment
outside kid blue piles the mans arms full of gold bars
thats twenty four there
im keeping count
two more trips should do it
joe gently lifts himself off his haunches
the tall gat man exits kid blue stays crouched over the floor safe hefting out bars his back to the bathroom
in the distance a gunshot
kid blues head perks up
from the bathroom
quick as lightning the kid draws his gat and spins but joe is already upon him full sprint
joe tackles the kid backwards
but while joe uses his momentum to leap over the open floor safe the kid tumbles back into it vanishing inside with a painful thud
joe scrambles to a stop lifts the heavy safe trap door and slams it down just as the kids hand grasps the open edge
with a sickening crack the trap door closes on the kids fingers
a bellowing howl his fingers withdraw and the safe door clicks shut
the electric box rigged to the code pad to crack it clatters off and whirrrr click
joe panting goes on hands and knees to the safe door and shouts clear and earnest kid listen kid
tell abe im going to fix this
tell him keep my bars safe cause i swear to god im going to fix this im going to find my loop and im gonna kill him
tell abe crack crack
the wood paneled floor above the safe door splinters upwards with gunshots and a chunk of joes right ear explodes
more blood than youd think spills down his neck joe falls back
three more shots crack crack crack
and now footsteps running down the hall
joe on his feet slipping in his own blood sprints across the apartment
the tall gat man appears in the doorway shooting blindly at joe chunks of wall and plaster exploding as joe doesnt stop but jumps out the window
floors up joe leaps out hits the fire escape bullets shattering the window
blind with blood ears ringing joe barrels down the fire escape
a confused blur of iron steps slipping and scrambling down but now the tall gat man is out the window and shooting down at him
somehow joe slips and rolls grabs at thin air falling three stories at least falling
when he hits the ground the world goes away
we abruptly cut on to a very familiar scene
young joe stands alone in the corn field in his stance ready to draw
but nothing happens
joe checks his watch confused
this is exactly the scene where old joe appears being replayed before our eyes
but when old joe does appear its different his hands are tied his head covered with a sack
and something very different happens joe raises his gun and without hesitation pulls the trigger
old joes chest explodes
he falls dead
joe approaches the body and slows
he pulls off the sack
the face of his older self
he flips him over
gold bars clink beneath a bloody jacket
joe has closed his loop
the other loopers buy joe drinks and cheer him celebrating
his belongings in boxes
joe unloads the gold bars from the trap door
out at sea
joe bundled against the cold leans on a railing eagerly watching the horizon
joe smoking in window of an empty apartment half unpacked
joe walking the city streets breathing deep
joe picks up a bottle of beer
several french gangsters in suits shake down the owner of the shop for money from the register
one holds a gun in the owners face
joe ignores them walks out
loud and dark
joe shotguns eye drops right out in the open dances like a madman
joes apartment unpacked and lived in
in a nook behind a wall panel stacks of cash
cloudy and cold
joe wanders alone
buffeted by strangers
music pumping joe deadened at a table in another world
beside him a young punk makes a glass float using his tk power then shatters the glass
red liquid goes everywhere
joe takes money from the stacks in the nook which have grown drastically low
later sets a hypo down in the ashtray
a gun in the face of the shops owner
held by joe
several years older now in his mid thirties
dressed in a suit surrounded by fellow gangsters
now part of their gang
a shoot out between rival gangs
joes guns blaze
a remorseless killer
blasting away cold and skillful
smashing up shops that wont pay protection
a dingy dark hallway
distant thumping bass indicates its maybe behind a club
the hall is lined with french gangster all similarly dressed
reminiscent of the gat men
it takes us a moment to recognize joe among them
in his early s now
his face a hard weathered mask
note it is here we transition from the actor playing young joe to the one playing old joe
snow on the ground
old joe high as a kite in an all out brawl
punched to the ground
laughing his ass off
a bar fight blossoms in slow motion all around
old joe looks up sees the woman who will be his wife for the first time
long red hair reminiscent of but not suzie
in a green dress
she flees the fighting towards the exit
a transfixed and high old joe follows her
puts his hand on her shoulder
she turns looks him over
flips him off
old joe watches her go
old joe hits on his future wife she tells him to fuck off
old joe in bed with his future wife
old joe shoots up a storefront with his gang
old joes future wife yells at him holding his gun holsters accusingly
she throws them across the room
later he holds her in bed both of them troubled
old joe driving
deep in thought
his future wife beside him her hand on his
he hits the brakes
the car screeches to a halt on a beach side road
old joe gets out runs across the beach to the water pulling his gun out of its holster
he fires it out to sea till its empty then throws the gun into the ocean
he runs back to his wife standing on the beach
they fall to the sand and kiss
a cottage in the country
old joe sweats and shudders out his drug addiction
his wife tends to him
old joe in his mid s his wife lying on a hammock with him reading
hands lazily entwined
a good life
the wife cuts vegetables
headlines in french scroll across a small floating screen against images of destruction
agangland terror spreads who is the rainmakera she turns it off
lazy dust motes hanging in the sunlight through the windows
old joe in bed in his late s
his wife walks through says something inconsequential puts her hand on his foot
draws it away fingers sliding off gently
and is gone
we stay with old joe
his deep breath
the sun warming the sheets
running water from the kitchen
his eyes focus on his hand
written in faded ink on the palm is a number we do not recognize
a long moment
with all the violence in the world the cottages green front door is kicked open
joe runs out of the bedroom half dressed and gangsters grab him taking him down with a rifle butt to the head
his wife is dragged from the kitchen screaming
dark cars parked out front
we watch the quiet facade for a moment too long violence that we dont want to think about happening inside
then the door bursts open and gangsters drag joe out sobbing thrashing and bleeding from his head
the gangsters carry joe in now hog tied
put a sack over his head
lead him towards a machine an iron monstrosity with a hatch
one of the men taps his watch hurry
another man pulls a large lever and the machine hums warming up
joes face covered with the sack
remembering flashes of his wife screaming
then joe lunges and somehow his hands are loose he punches one man tears off the sack punches another man a flurry and then its over
he stands among a pile of broken men
slowly takes stock
looks at the exit
looks at the faded number on his blood smeared hand
a million things in his mind
but just one choice
the machine hums angrily
like an iron coffin
old joe climbs inside
closes the hatch behind him
flash and crack and he is sent
and appears in front of his younger self
the scene now plays out as it did the first time
joe hesitates old joe gets the upper hand knocks him out
old joe looks around gets his bearings
stares at his younger self a moment
then goes to the truck
old joe drives the truck into the city
old joe walks in quickly gets aspirin wrapped sandwiches bandages big bottles of water
removes his torn jacket dumps it
at the register the clerk bags everything up
old joe pulls the blunderbuss on the clerk
and your jacket
wearing the clerks jacket old joe takes four aspirin
holds his head a minute rocking gently
on the street outside the building
old joe approaches watching the window high above
weighing his options
he scans the street
spots an armored van in the alleyway
movement from behind it kid blue and the tall gat man loading their bars in the back
old joe turns to go but stops when his eye catches movement between parked cars
young joe hid between the cars looking up at the apartment building weighing his options
dont do it
dont do it
after a moment joe dashes across the street and into the building
old joe stays still a moment watching him go
ducks into shadows as kid blue and the tall gat man step from the alleyway wiping their hands
two more trips
they enter the building
old joe takes a breath then casually walks down the sidewalk past the alleyway scoping the armored van
a gat man driver in the drivers seat
the gat man driver watches old joe disappear from view
suspicious he uncovers a gat on the seat beside him
when he looks back up old joe stands in his headlights blunderbuss raised
the windshield shatters the gat man driver is torn apart
old joe runs up flings open the door digs through the bloody mess frantically finding the gat
old joe dashes out onto the street as gunfire cracks from the high apartment window
sharp eyes will notice that old joes right ear is now clipped off an old wound
he dashes towards the apartment door gun in hand but stops when the window five stories above shatters with gunfire
old joe backs up and sees joe scrambling down the fire escape as the tall gat man fires down at him
old joe takes expert aim with the gat and fires three shots upwards
the tall gat mans gunfire stops
joe slips on the fire escape falls two stories and lands on the hood of a parked car
old joe goes to him checks his pulse
behind them the tall gat man hits the sidewalk with a splat
old joe goes to the tall gat mans remains picks another gat out of them and goes back to joes inert body on the car hood
stupid little shit
he lifts him in his arms
joe wakes slowly pained
lying alone in an abandoned lot on the outskirts of town
slowly he takes stock of himself
a tight bandage on his ear
a mournful train whistle and he turns
through a chain link fence the train yard
he was put here for a reason
a man and a young boy in rags hop onto an empty cargo car heading out of town
joe watches the boy his eyes angry
and walks away from the train yard
something like a helicopter sweeps overhead a spotlight zigzagging the area
joe ducks into shadows heading towards the city
a swarm of activity gat men rushing in and out
he aint dumb like the last we gotta get lucky now
cover the roads out of town
sweep the streets pull in his social circle pound the pavement
map spread on a table
gat men gathered around abe
hell hop a train
fast and untraceable
sweep the train yard
every second that passes is bad go
kid blue slumps in a chair holding a rag to a wound on his head
eyes wet from crying
abe storms in
stupid little shit
i cant hear you abe leans in next to his ear and shouts well thats what happens when you fire a gat in a steel box you stupid little shit
i can fix this
i can find him
go home and let the grown ups work
more helicopters sweep the streets searchlights blazing
cars with gat men circle slowly shining spotlights themselves
joe leaps from the shadows ducks behind a dumpster
barely avoiding the light
he wont last long out here
where would i go if i were me
he sprints into an alleyway but gat men are coming down the other side with flashlights
goes back the way he came turns a corner
joe finds himself in front of a familiar bright red garage
three stories up seths darkened window
he looks up at it hesitant but desperate
a window shatters inward punched through by a wrapped fist
a big reading hall empty and dark
the broken window opens old joe slides in
weaves his way past the reading tables finds what hes looking for at a desk
a suspended sheet of thin plastic turns out to be a computer
checking his hand he inputs the number
navigates menus and windows information flashing searching
gat men in cars and helicopters patrol the streets
kid blue sits on the curb smoking a cigarette
seething at his bandaged hand
deep in thought
his eyes lift
the familiar red garage
and three stories up seths lit window
kid blue pulls a small caliber gun from a holster concealed on his boot enters the building
old joe finishes printing several large documents that look like maps
he folds them up pockets them
dashes to the window starts to heft himself up and stops
on his hand a smooth aged scar
of an arrow
pointing to his wrist
old joes breath catches
he pulls down his sleeve revealing aba then aea then aa then ata
he bares his arm reading the entire message
the peephole screen on the inside of seths apartment door
kid blue manipulating a device a shower of sparks blows the screen out momentarily and the door swings open
kid blue storms in his gun drawn sweeping through the apartment with over eager purpose
goes to the peephole screen touches it and a menu comes up
a little manipulating and the image is rewinding
an empty hall scanning back half an hour
then young joe
kid blue stops scanning hits a play
joe feels around the door jam retrieves a key and enters the apartment
kid blue exhales
well joe was here
taps the screen again it goes back to a live feed and hes about to step away when his eye catches something
he pushes a square on the screen and the view changes
to a live feed from a camera in the ceiling of the apartment
excited kid rewinds this half an hour
on the screen joe enters the apartment
rifles around a little then sits at the table
head in his hands
staring into space
then goes to a kitchen drawer opens it gets something
goes to the front door takes something off the wall briskly exits
kid blue stops the screen
he goes and sits where joe sat
stares where joe stared
the kitchen counter
a blender sink
can labeled acoffee
a kid goes to the kitchen drawer joe opened pulls it open
its full of knives
kid goes finally to the door looks at the wall
a small rack for keys several hanging and one empty hook
kid blue stares into space trying to put these pieces together
lights a cigarette
the sun rises over a flat endless field of corn stalks
we push forward through the green stalks at a brisk pace
they part before us endless hypnotic
the same from the previous flashback
old joe in bed half asleep
a womans arm under his neck
it slips away and he kisses its wrist
the woman leaving
her hand touches and slides off his foot moving away
old joe emerges from the corn fields bordering the sidecar roadside diner
fumbles in his jacket dry swallows four aspirin
regains his footing
walks around the diner cautiously
parked in back behind a dumpster seths slat bike
joe sits at a booth
old joe enters steps up slowly sits
a moment of silence
along with his ear joes hand and arm are now wrapped in bloodied bandages
joes eyes go to old joes arm
old joe pulls his sleeve back and shows him the scar spelling abeatrix
a beatrix the waitress steps up breezily
are we eating
i ordered something
steak and eggs rare and scrambled
two steak eggs coming up
were not going to talk about time travel
didnt know if youd i put it together
do i get the scar when youre cut or when the knife is on its way down and its inevitable that youre going to be cut
im not cutting myself again to im not asking you to
its an interesting question ive just lost a lot of blood today
you know theres another girl here on weekends
have fun explaining who a beatrix is for the next thirty years
beatrix sets old joes black coffee next to joes white
hows the french coming
fast in french i know you have a gun between your legs
joes face registers obvious incomprehension
well youll get there eventually
i dont care what youre here for whatever you think youre going to get from me
more time or whatever you want
i cant let you walk away from this diner alive
because the next years of my im sorry to cut off sorry are mine theyre not yours to cut off this spiel youve theyre not yours anymore you been practicing
all night can say anything you want but but i need you to need you to youre not walking outta here listen
alive you know what the voice of god sounds like
see now good youre confused now but youre listening
i hope the voice of god sounds like an old man speaking french
old men speaking french sound like primeval trees in a strong wind just irrefutable
wise strong gentle all these things in harmony complimentary
old men speaking french
young men speaking french sound without exception like weenies
you ever hear a frenchman under try to sound threatening
english is a tight t shirt flatters the young
rat a tat tat
french is a double breasted suit
young man can put it on but it always feels like hes putting something on
some things you just need the years
its my favorite language
ive got a life ahead of me thats mine and im not giving it up for you or anybody
well you know what you have to do then why dont you take your little gun out from between your knees and do it
one in the head two in the heart
its all aanybodya and anevera and then you show up here and think you can talk me into dying
well bullshit we both know youre not going to kill me
christ you ordered eggs
old joe downs two aspirin
takes a breath
i know why you couldnt pull that trigger
when youre tasked to do the unthinkable your mind itll do anything it can to stop you
only way is you gotta know why youre doing it in your bones so you can say it out loud to someone without apologizing
or you gotta cut yourself off go numb
but thatll kill you down the line
its hard to make eye contact with you
its too strange
your face looks backwards
yeah that helps actually
that little twist of unfamiliar
youre not winning some pissing contest by looking me in the eye you didnt know what i looked like until yesterday it makes sense that its easier for you
i wasnt trying to
do you know whats going to happen
have you already done all this right now as me
no not exactly i dont want to talk about time travel shit because well start talking about it and then well be here all day making diagrams with straws
it doesnt matter
when i hurt myself now it changes your body
do my actions change your memories
it doesnt matter because i dont know how it works
nobody knows how it works
time travel was an accident thirty years from now the smartest men in the world know exactly one thing about it that you dont they know to be scared to
death of it
my memory is cloudy theres a cloud
its a it starts clear then gets cloudy as it goes back
goddammit hand me those
joe passes him two
and the salt
no the pepper
old joe sets two straws about a foot apart parallel and pours pepper between them thus ok the span between the straws is a timeline of the next years
the left straw is the present moment right now
the right straw is the moment thirty years from now when i was sent back
the machine is tuned to a fixed time you know that some years its not adjustable
whats the pepper
the pepper is a sort of fog
see my memories start clear here at the right straw but as they go back they get cloudier until theyre totally obscured
its like a fog
because my memories arent really memories theyre one possible eventuality now and they grow clearer or cloudier as they become more or less likely
but then they get to the present moment the left straw and theyre instantly clear again
like a wall of fog moving forward with the present moment
i can remember what you do after you do it
he pushes the left straw slowly towards the right and it pushes the pepper with it
so you can and it hurts
so when were apart you can remember what i do
after i do it
but beatrix brings their food two identical plates
old joe awkwardly clears away the pepper and straws
this is a precise description of a fuzzy mechanism
time travel fucks everything my brain and body try to catch up
thats why its dangerous
and it hurts
all i know i know two things for sure
i know whats happening in my head
and i know that youre still going to meet her
old joe takes a worn double of joes pocket watch from his pocket clicks it open
we dont see inside it but he stares at it intently
this is a woman what
im going to fall in love with
shes gonna save your life
old joe makes eye contact with joe for maybe the first time and holds it
unexpectedly naked on his face is the deepest sort of grief
deep and unrelenting
joe cant look at it he breaks off his gaze
the grief is too much for old joe to swallow back down so he turns it into anger
for a long time at the beginning she thought wed have a baby
she would have been a good mother
she wanted that so much
and now im saying sorry to a picture
how is she you said save my life
at your life
youre a killer and a junkie
and a fucking child mentality amy life a awhats mine
a save your life youre asking how
the question is why
why would someone waste themselves on you give up the good life they had sacrifice a good life to love you
my life is my own i dont need it shut your fucking child mouth
shes going to clean you up and youre going to take her love like a sponge and youre both going to pretend that shes saved you youre so self absorbed
thirty years from now is yesterday
and i can remember it its going to happen
let me tell you whats going to happen to this woman who saved your worthless life
a green door kicked in with all the violence in the world
his wife spins as gangsters burst into the entryway
old joe in bed
it plays out again
he leaps to his feet is tackled by the gangsters
they drag old joe from the bedroom
though the hall joe sees the woman struggling against two gangsters her dress torn and bloody
one approaches her with the knife
old joe screams struggles but cannot stop them from doing what they do to her
joe is not sure where to put his eyes
have you heard of the rainmaker
seth said that night
a new boss in the future he said
the rainmaker came out of nowhere and in the span of six months took total control of the five major syndicates
that would take an army
but he didnt have an army
legend is he did it alone
dont know i believe the legend but he didnt have an army
how did he do it
thats the question
and no one knows
not only that theres no pictures of him
theres stories he has a synthetic jaw
things like that
but word spread quick about him through the ex looper grapevine even before his mass executions and vagrant purges and reign of terror because the first thing he did was
start closing loops
all of them
exterminating the whole program
old joe pulls the folded papers he printed at the library out of his jacket puts them on the table
do you know what this is
on the back of his papers he scrawls the number
as he writes it a phone starts ringing bringing us into an th story office under siege
gangsters down in the street fire up at the windows with guns
helicopters pass by
the office door is blocked shut with a filing cabinet
on the phone the looper dale but in his mid s
battered and terrified
holding a piece of paper reading off it on the phone with old joe
the wall with the door in it explodes inward
the line goes dead
old joe hangs up
looks at his hand with the number
standing in his cottage before he was sent back
through the window his wife working in the garden
old joe closes his hand
this is a piece of identifying information on the rainmaker
i can use it to find him now and stop him from killing my wife
old joe showing the number to joe
none of this concerns me
were done were gonna walk outside now
this is going to happen it happened to you it doesnt have to happen to me
points the pocket watch you got her picture in there
show it to me
show me her picture
and when i see her for the first time ill walk away and she wont be with me
i guarantee the instant i look at her picture that fog in your brain will swallow up the memories of her and shell be gone
shell be safe
and then we can all do what we have to do
old joe holding the pocket watch gazing at it
then he snaps it closed in his fist drawing it back
no you dont understand
we dont have to give her up
im going to tell you why im here now
he puts his hand on the folded papers
im gonna save her
a quick beat
joe goes for his gun
but old joe is fast he jams his foot into joes crotch crushing the hidden gun into him
joe cries out old joe grabs his hair and plants his face into the table
when joes hands go to his face old joe grabs them and pulls
foot in his crotch pulling his arms tight over the table
the rainmaker is alive right now
living here somewhere in this county
and i can find him with this
i need you to lay low stay out of my way and not get caught
i know how to fix this i wont stop till i finish it
im going to find him and kill him
joes face loosens his eyes on their coffee cups
its been awhile since weve gotten a warm up
old joe realizes looks around
the diner is eerily quiet
beatrix and the staff have all quietly left
old joe swings out of the booth still holding joe by the hair dragging him like a doll
joes blunderbuss clatters to the ground
old joe drags him to the window
they look out
nothing in the parking lot
its been thirty years for me so its hard to remember
when you stole seths bike you stripped out the security tracker
joes fearful face says a no
old joe draws his gat
make it to the field you can lose them in the field
go east and hop joe punches old joe square in the jaw and he goes down
his papers and gun fall
the diner door explodes
ive got him
a gat man barrels in his gat blazing
joe scrambles but old joe gets the gat
with an expert shot old joe puts the gat man down but there are two more behind him
pinned behind a booth old joe returns fire glass breaking and chaos
joe grabs at the papers old joe grabs them first and yanks
leaving joe with a torn off top sheet
joe scrambles away down the length of the diner behind the booths back to their table as the gat men and old joe have their fire fight
joes blunderbuss on the ground beneath the table
he scoops it up
turns and fires at old joe
joes blunderbuss hacks another shot and the window behind old joe explodes
old joe makes his break sprints for the broken window jumps
and hits the dusty parking lot running
towards the corn
kid blue squats on his haunches with four more gat men their guns trained on the diner door
three gat men burst out followed by joe
the back hes running
they all run around back where old joe is halfway to the corn but not there yet
the seven gat men and kid blue and joe fire their guns after him while running but theyre too far away and theyre running so nothing hits
joe blasts at the old man blindly sprinting with all his might eyes streaming tears in the dust
when old joe hits the wall of corn he seems to vanish
four of the gat men follow him in while the remaining pursuers slow to a stop doubled over panting
it takes a few seconds for kid blue to realize that joe is there with them
it takes another second for joe to realize that the dynamic has changed
he turns and runs back towards the diner kid blue and the gat men in pursuit
one of the gat men fires
joe makes it to the slat bike jumps on hits the ignition
no fuck no fucking piece of shit click click
the kid and the gats closing in and just the moment that kid blue lays his hands on the back of the bike the engine turns over with a roar
the back of the bike kicks up heat and air blasts from the open slats beneath blowing kid blue back on his ass
the bike hovers a few feet off the ground
joe roars off into the corn
the kid is on his feet running back to the gat men
get the tracker
joe riding at full speed through the thick corn stalks
he bails snapping through corn stalks and rolling to a painful stop
the bike zooms onward through the stalks quickly out of sight
pained joe lies still breathing hard
pulls old joes torn paper from his pocket
on one side the number old joe scribbled he flips it over
its a map
mostly of empty farm land bisected by a bold highway and scattered farm houses
one of them is circled in black
a bare field of churned chocolatey earth
near its edge juts the dead stump of an old tree
a young woman in work clothes named sara chops away at the trunk with a large axe
over and over splintering it apart
endless plains of corn surround the field
in the near distance a two story farm house with an adjacent barn
sara focused on her work as the sun rises
sara fiddles with a garbage can sized device and with a crackle of mechanic thrusters it floats up and over the corn fields spraying something chemical
sara makes coffee
she sits on a rocking chair and mimes smoking an invisible cigarette
our first good look at her face
clear and beautiful but it has been here for awhile
the morning light changes from steel blue to pale white
rocking gently fake smoking and drinking coffee
not going anywhere
blinds drawn dark
a figure lies in bed
sara steps in puts her hand on the sleeping figures foot
time to get up
the front door bangs
she looks up
the screen door bangs in the wind
sara inspects it
the latch is broken
through the screen door some fifty yards across the front lawn the dark figure of a man stands at the edge of the corn fields
she watches right back for a long moment
then grabs a shotgun mounted above the door and with no hesitation at all plows outside
the dark figure vanishes into the corn fields
sara storms down the porch and stalks across the lawn shotgun extended
not fucking around
does not slow her pace until she is ten yards from the corn fields where she plants herself and shouts listen up fucker
i have shot and buried three vagrants in the past year
if you want to know the christs honest truth im starting to get a taste for it
so i dont care what hobo sob story youve got i get a dozen a week and it cuts no cash with me
its me and my husband here were broke and angry at our lot in this world and heavily armed
so take some corn and move on but if you show your face again i will cut you the fuck in half
just the wind in the corn
a long beat
then sara turns walks briskly back
moments later joes face pokes through the corn stalks
he takes in the farm
the barn behind it
the fallow field
joe sits in the same spot a few feet in the corn but with a clear sight line at the house
his gun on his knee
joes face pale sweating
pinches his eyes
the sun pounds down
he looks at the piece of map
helicopters sweep by
abe stands fuming flanked by two gat men
kid blue sits like a kid in detention
you found him
and you russeled up a posse and went to git a em
like a good little cowboy from one of your movie movies
without telling me
i can do it again
you can fuck up again
you know what happens to me if i dont get that old bastard
i got too much riding kid i cant afford a fuck up playing cowboy
put your gat on the table
fighting tears now kid puts his gun on the desk
but he doesnt take his hand off it
i wanted you to say i did good thats all i wanted
this is all i have
abe puts his hand on the gat
kids finger still on the trigger
a tense moment
abe pulls the gun away across the table
please just give me one more chance ill bring him here alive and hold him and you can put a bullet in his brain yourself abe grabs the hammer
slams it on kids bad hand crushing it
kid howls the gat men grab him
kid is literally dragged up the stairs by a gat man
the gat man shoves kid blue through the twisty maze of backstage past girls and loopers and men
the kid blubbers and bleeds
but he pulls himself halfway together
make a show im gonna make this good again
im gonna be back
the gat man pushes the kid out the back entrance door into the alley
the kid instinctively turns towards the street
but the gat man steers him back deeper into the alley
the kid realizes what this means
oh no no no no he fights in vain to break from the gat mans grip
weeps begs clasps at whatever he can grab
the gat man turns a corner towards the alleys dead end
no no no no
annoyed the gat man throws the kid hard to the concrete
the gat man pulls his gun raises it without ceremony
the gat mans face explodes
staggers his gun fires into the wall
he drops like a doll
kid blue lies in the rain hyperventilating
his pant leg hiked up showing his boot with its holster
in his mangled left hand the small caliber pistol he keeps stashed
his pinkie on the trigger
cradling his crushed hand dazed he scampers off like a soaked rat
silent and still
sara comes out onto the front porch
she gathers up a few things turns out the porch light
notices a floodlight still lit on the barn across the yard
she turns the porch light back on
the dark corn fields silent and vaguely threatening
she steps back in the house emerging again with the shotgun
sara stalks towards the barn shotgun in hand
shadows loom across the yard
all is silent
she reaches the barn
a hard pool of light from a mounted floodlight falls off to inky darkness
hits a metal switch near the barn door and the light snaps off
in its absence the darkness swarms
she briskly walks back towards the house but slows
in the darkness by the barn crunch crunch
and maybe a shape
deep in the swarming dark
sara levels the shotgun at the darkness and steps back
quiet but definite crunch crunch
and now definitely a shape
coming towards her
stop right there
joe slumped over unconscious where we left him in the corn
saras shout wakes him with a start
something is wrong with him
in a flash of panic he parts the corn stalks sees sarah backing away from the barn
the dark hulking figure of a man pursues her slowly but steadily
his hand goes to his holster but his gun has fallen out he scrambles in the dirt for it
sara backing up still shotgun leveled
the man still in darkness comes towards her
you stop right there you stop
she fires her gun in the air
the man pauses but then continues towards her
she trips on a root falls
from a childs pov we run across a darkened bedroom to the window
a childs hand smacks the glass and framed through the pane through the unseen childs eyes this is what we sara on the ground fumbling the gun
the dark man advancing towards her menacingly
at the last moment from the corn fields joe runs into the light and steps directly between them shouts his gun raised at the dark man
and the dark man stops
joes gun leveled face set
but the porch light on the mans face it is not old joe
it is a man in his s filthy with downs syndrome
a greasy sign around his neck aplease help muwte food god joe lowers his gun face melting
to the mute vagrant hey hey
im going to get you but the man scampers off leaving his sign
the child in darkness watching
he recedes into the bedroom his hand slipping off the glass
sara stands picks up the sign calls after the mute
hey you forgot your greasy goddamn hobo sign oh for godssakes
turns to joe alright what are you
joe turns away from her quickly but doubles over crumpling to a heap on the grass
sara checks his face
look at hey
the fuck ehh
she steps away
takes a moment
she drags joe up onto the porch under the light
up here at the light
sara slaps him
his eyes snap open
he sees her face
she feels his head
checks his eyes
cherry red and veined swollen under the lids
time eventualities he said how long since you dropped
sara mimes an eye dropper
dropped or what the kids call it
she leans back on her haunches looks at him deep in thought
deciding what to do
joe lies prone shaking sweating
i cant feel my legs youre withdrawing from a synthetic barbiturate
its a quick punch but its this bad a day in without care you might not make it through the night
sara looks at his shoes
beneath the caked mud fine leather
her eyes linger on his gun
they turn cold
she stands quickly without a word vanishing into the house
joe lies still breath shallow
turns his head hazy
soft footsteps approach
small bare feet padding towards him through the front door
a young boy steps out onto the porch years old named cid
cid looks joe over
his eyes linger on joes gun
then he kneels his small hands feeling joes sweaty face
pushes a straw to joes lips
joes hands clasp around a plastic cup with a cartoon tiger and he drinks
cid goes back into the house leaving his cup with joe
sara tries to pick cid up but he dodges walks up the stairs
whos that man
just a vagrant babe
sara leads him down the hall and into his bedroom
no hes not
his shoes are too shiny
well arent you a smart monkey
he gets in bed
is he sick
will he get better
go to sleep
night baby boy
lingers over him in the pale light
a darkened highway the lights of the farm house distant
a small stake bed truck rumbles up stops on the soft shoulder
sara at the wheel
sits a second
then climbs out
roughly pulls joe out of the flatbed
he lands in the dirt
sara avoids looking at him closes up the flatbed
joe weakly grabs her ankle
she pries his hand off and discovers cids cup in the dirt beside him
takes it angrily strides back to the truck
sara gets in drops cids cup on the seat beside her
looks in her rear view mirror
leaving a man to die
looks down at cids cup
for a long moment
sara lights a gas lamp
threads a hose from a tank of water around the cot
joe on a metal cot covered with blankets
drink it all night more than you think you want
moves a metal bucket next to the bed
adjusts the blankets
aim for the bucket
and dont chew your tongue off
in the morning were gonna talk
the last thing she does is handcuff his wrist to the cot and take his gun
on her way out she puts it on a bench beside the door and turns out the floodlight
exhausted gat men dutifully patrol the streets with flashlights stopping every passerby
on the outskirts of the city
vagrant fires burn distant orange
a large drainage pipe drips into a brackish creek
we move through it
cavernous space beneath a high street grating damp and cold
old joe sits on the ground methodically cleaning and loading his gun
places the gun on top of his folded torn maps
closes his eyes
sees a bank of fog clears revealing saras face looking down at us
she slaps us hard
old joe touches his temple
the first time i saw her face
his pocket watch sits open in front of him
he picks it up
old joe holds his pocket watch tight like a talisman
fingers dug deep in his head
the first time i saw her face
a fist comes straight at us
we reel back revealing the paris club crowded and rowdy
a piece of old joes life that weve seen before
joe mid s lies on the ground lip bloodied laughing hysterically at a young punk who has just hit him
a bar fight blossoms in slow motion all around
joe looks up sees the woman who will be his wife for the first time
in her green dress
whisps of fog drift into frame
inside old joes pocket watch a picture
of his wife
the sun breaks in through the grate above
old joe closes the pocket watch holds in tight
then he stands and picks up the gun and goes
a child stands in a massive doorway with blinding white light beaming through
joes face wrecked but his eyes flutter
joe lies on the cot
the barn doors the morning sun rising through
if the child was there hes gone now
cid draws at the kitchen table
the mans up
sara stiffens looks out the window
is he staying here now
fingers part the green and old joe peers through the dense foliage
old joe hides in the trees across the street from a suburban track home
a young boy in a bright jacket runs out the front door and off down the street
old joe checks the folded map in his trembling hands
on it this house is circled in black exactly like saras farm
stuffing the map in his pocket he pushes out through the trees
sara approaches the barn her shotgun in hand
joe sits on the ground just outside the open barn door the metal cot behind him still handcuffed to his wrist
methodically cleaning and loading his gun
then half annoyed i just finished cleaning alright
tosses it into the dirt
sara lowers the shotgun slightly
how do you feel
im at thirty percent
take it slow and by the end of the week youll be at fifty
she tosses him a key he unlocks his handcuff
i took you in so you wouldnt die and now youre not going to die
so take the morning to rest then you need to get off my farm
i cant do that
i need to stay here for a little while longer
i am not cool with that
well im sorry
well im sorry too you just lost your take the morning to rest privileges get off my farm
sara raises the shotgun
get off my farm
you couldnt scare a retarded hobo with that thing
this is a remington one blast could cut you the fuck in half
and thats thats telling
youre holding a gun
i say im not afraid so you describe the gun to me
but its not the gun im not afraid of
what are you gonna shoot in the air
blow a hole in your barn
to scare me
but you couldnt let me die you wont kill me
so now i saved your life that makes me weak
look im not a threat to you or your boy
i need to be on your property but id prefer to not have any contact with you at all ill stay in the fields
theres just one thing you need to do for me and you wont have to deal with me again
he takes the map from his pocket unfolds it
tosses it over to her
just verify for me thats your house on the map
so i know im in the right place
what is this
thats my house
why is it marked
ill be out of the barn in an hour if you can spare it ill take the water jug with me
does that well have water
ill fill it from there
sara turns the map over
sees the number that old joe wrote on the back
and everything changes
what is this
she shows him the number
she is not asking what the number is she knows
joe is suddenly not so relaxed
what is this
does that mean something to you
for the first time in their conversation joe looks in her eyes
sara stares daggers searching
very different than she was ten seconds ago
joe scoots back
and without hesitating sara hefts the shotgun and shoots him
rips his shirt open bloody blows him back screaming
old joe stops in his tracks children running around him
his hand goes to his temple
fog clears from sara blasting us with her shotgun
old joes hand runs from his temple to his neck
feels a new but old scar just a little divot behind his ear
sara drags joe in by the foot
she heaves the barn door closed
in the lamp lit dark joe rolls and groans in the dirt
who are you
she shoves the shotgun barrel in his face a rush of fury youre right im not a killer but i am fine with how a blast of rock salt to
your face wont kill you
who are you and what are you here for
who are you
joe breathes hard bleeding in the dirt with a shotgun in his nose
but he forces calm
then he starts talking
time travel hasnt been invented yet
but in thirty years it will be
a suburban park
on its far end a birthday party
the young boy in the bright jacket we saw run out of the house earlier sits alone under a tree
old joe approaches him
im chads father
arent you going to come over
were doing cake
its ice cream cake and i cant eat ice cream
cause of the milk
well you should join the party even if you dont have cake
you have a birthday coming up
we were gonna go to the lake but i dont think we are now
old joe leaves walks across the grass
having trouble breathing
joe weakly talks the end of a long explanation
i cant go back to the city and find him cause abe the boss all his men are going to search the streets till they turn up me or
all i have is this map
and that hes coming here
deep in thought
did you know about loopers what we do ive heard stories
so hes coming here to murder me and my son because he thinks we might be this rainmaker
and once he kills the rainmaker what happens
he thinks the instant the rainmaker dies hell never have been sent back so hell just vanish and be back with his wife
the same track home old joe studied from the trees earlier
daniel trots towards it coming home from the birthday party
who is he
the guy you let run
just some random guy from the future
you know what these numbers mean
well tended by someone who loves growing things
laurels ivy on trellises flowers and trees
daniel comes through the side gate
lifts the back door matt revealing a dusty key
sara takes a pen from a workbench
shows joe the numbers she draws lines with the pen thus this is my son cids birthday
and this is the hospital he was born in
joes face taking this in
sitting in a corner of the yard
face set hard
daniel stands key in hand
drops the matt
sees old joe standing now
stillness between them
old joes face
struggling to be stone and then it is
he draws his gun in one fluid motion and fires
we dont hear the shot
we just hear the garden the wind through the plants
and we just see old joes face
struggling now to remain stone
numb he puts his gun away and exits
old joe walks across the park
map in his hand
children play in the distance
childrens voices all around
old joe spins his breath up into his head
the map falls to the ground
the park around him green and full of children
he keels over onto his knees and cries
grabs the grass holds it in his fingers thick and green
the wife stands at the edge of a bed
and full of life
old joe on the bed
she unsnaps her green dress and it falls leaving her naked in the sunlight
on the bed
old joe and the wife
drifting into sleep
from a neighboring apartment a baby cries
loud and insistent
old joe opens his eyes joking annoyed at the crying baby
agod you have to be kidding me
a then he sees her face
her smiling eyes listening to the neighbors baby cry
like shes listening to music
she touches his hand
staring at the grass
on the map beside him three circled houses around the city
and the torn corner
sara holds the torn piece of map in her hands
their house circled
would he do this
think about what doing this would fix
what he thinks it would fix
sara caught that and she did not like it
hell kill the other kids on that map and then come here last
put off facing me
if he comes here can you stop him
she turns the paper over in her hands
given this if i erred on the side of caution and believed all of this im asking
if i trusted you
will you stop him before he gets to my son
ive lost my life
i kill this man i get it back
you can trust me
they sit on the steps joe stripped to the waist
sara picks salt chunks from his chest with tweezers and antiseptic
joe surveys the surrounding land cleaning his gun
were surrounded by the corn that leaves us blind
he can get within fifty yards of the house without a hawk spotting him
what makes sense is we burn the fields level them
sara realizes hes seriously asking
no you cannot burn down my corn fields
what kind of equipments in the barn
nothing that shoots
no farm equipment that shoots
joe finishes assembling his gun
saras eyes flick to it
you use what you need set up anywhere
but one thing i dont want you talking to cid
i watch my son you watch the corn
thats the deal
good by me
he hisses as she applies antiseptic to a gash in his arm
easy for things to get infected on a farm start falling off
caught off guard joe almost smiles
if im out here and youre in the house were gonna need some way to communicate
theres a dinner bell down by the barn ring that if someones coming ill hear it
we need walkies or buzzers
dunno what weve got but ill look
she spots cid at the screen door watching them
she goes to take him inside
got any ammo for that shotgun
that isnt a seasoning
sara leads cid back into the house
hows the maths coming
i wanna help the man
help him what
i could help him with my toys
i need you to stay away from that man
let him cid squirms out of her grasp bats her away with a light but angry slap
she grabs his arm harder
let him do his thing but you stay with me
is he not good
well were gonna see what he is
but you stick with me
old joes little hide out
he violently washes his hands in a trench of water
slumps back eyes blood red
streaks of tears down his face
reddish light fading to blue through the grating high above
runs fingers across his forehead spreading cooling water
his eyes close
his breathing shallows
in one hand he holds his pocket watch
he places the other on the gat
the map beneath it
daniels map location crossed out
two others remaining
and the missing corner edge torn
close on old joes face
slipping to sleep
then from nowhere a childs hand enters frame and rests on his forehead
old joes eyes gasp open with terror but its joe who wakes up with a start
slumped against the steps gun in hand
cids hand on his forehead
cid steps back quickly puts his finger to his lips
cid leads joe inside beckoning him to follow
cid leads joe to the kitchen table
laid out on it an arrangement of toys
with the deliberateness of a man at work cid clicks on a flashlight and sets it on the table
works on several toys cracking open cases pulling out wires
hands moving fast
joe sits watching cid
hand me that phillips
joe hands him the screwdriver
cid keeps working
tell me if you hear her coming
what are we doing here
he pushes a button on a small plastic box in his hands and an identical one next to joe lights up
the way joe looks at cid changes slightly
but i need to make it stronger
how do you do that
joe idly fingers a toy
do you kill people
joe half laughs
cid keeps working his face in shadows
lets say i kill people
with your gun
cid looks at him in the dark
not scared at all
then he goes back to fitting the backing on a toy
a long beat joe thinking
broken by a piercing noise
they both jump the toy truck joe has idly played with is shrieking sirens blaring
joe fumbles with it cid reaches over and switches it off they both freeze
and look up at the ceiling
silence in the house
with a look of reproach beyond his years cid takes the truck from joe and finishes up his work
how long have you and your mom been on the farm
shes not my mom
my mom got killed when i was a baby
someone bad bad men killed her
cid sets the two finished buzzers on the table
sara doesnt think i remember cause i was a baby
but i remember my mom
i couldnt stop her getting killed
i dont remember it all but i remember
i was a baby
i couldnt do anything
i couldnt stop it
cause i was a baby
cid is crying
joe has never been more at a loss
im sorry takes the buzzers
you should talk to your mom about this
shes not my mom
shes a liar
with one last look back at cid in the dark joe exits
sirens flashlights behind him
zig zags through an alleyway a pursuing car smashing up behind him
bursts out onto the street nearly hit by another car
shouts all around a few shots
a gat man briefing abe who hasnt gotten much sleep lately
spotted him coming out of a sewer tunnel on the west end hes on the every fucking car every gat every cop get a em down there
flood that fucker
take him down
cars motorcycles cop prowlers all roar to life and blaze through the city streets in one direction
kid blue squatting in the th story of a half finished highrise looks down on the activity in the streets
spread on the floor are maps with notes
hes been searching for old joe
and now his eyes are alight
he bolts for the stairs
a small park on one block
with a playground
swings and a merry go round
gat men sweep the park
after they pass old joes face pops up under the merry go round
he crouches in a shallow space beneath it
he sees across from the park a cheap apartment building
he checks his map the nd circled address
kid number two
sara chops the dead tree trunk in the field greatly diminished but still formidable
cant you pull that out with a plow
she keeps chopping
i found a in the barn i found some parts and i made a thing
joe pushes one of cids buzzers into her hands which we now see is a colorful plastic frog toy with a light bulb nose
if you see anything just push that and joe pushes the button on his buzzer and saras lights up and vibrates
she regards the toy then stares hard and cold at joe
he woke me up
dont tell him i told you though he
sara rolls her eyes turns away
starts chopping again
joe doesnt leave
you said you were his mom
he told me youre not
this hits sara hard
she resumes chopping to cover it
he said that
if hes not your son who is he
hes my son
i had cid when i was twenty two
but i didnt want to give up my life
in the city
the word acitya has weight for her
so i dropped cid with my mom here
and my sister
and they saw how i was living and they took him
my sister raised him here she loved him
he called her mom
howd she get killed
when saras eyes hit him theyre daggers
cid told me
you have to talk to him about it
icy silence from sara and an odd stare
i told you one thing i told you to stay away from my son
he asked about my gun
you think this is going to go away if you dont talk to him about it but its just gonna grow stay out of it
stay the fuck away from my son
she goes back to chopping
joe lingers then leaves
she hacks away
sara sits with coffee looking out at the fields
deep in thought
she takes a drag from her pretend cigarette
a motel style building
gat men in cars pass occasionally with spotlights and radios but the activity has calmed
old joe slips around a corner
checks the address on the map
makes a break for stairs leading to the nd level
but just at that moment a car pulls into the buildings lot
old joe ducks under the stairs
holding his breath
the car parks
slumping exhausted up the stairs
and through the slatted steps old joe sees her face flash by
it is suzie the girl from abes brothel
old joes face pure disbelief
he recognizes her instantly
it cant be
he gingerly steps half a foot out
looking up he can see the apartment doors above
suzie walks down the landing
jesus it cant be
then she passes it
old joes eyes relieved
she stops at the next door over knocks
it opens vaguely indistinct conversation between her and the girl that answers
sorry i know i promised five you know how it gets
dont worry sugar
she was no problem
gat men searched through here lookin for god knows
suzie disappears into the apartment
re emerges holding a sleeping year old girl
she whispers goodbye to the neighbor and walks back to apartment
old joe frozen
gun in his hand
face numbly ayou have to be shitting me
a he climbs the stairs
on the nd story landing
breath held back against the wall
peeks in the window
on the couch suzie holding her daughter
head in her lap
stroking her hair
suzies back is to us and with her long red hair down she is eerily reminiscent of old joes wife
old joe watches them for a long time
joe sits watching the corn
it rustles in the wind
hand on his blunderbuss
beside it his frog buzzer
the tension is constant
and its a long long day
sara vacuums while cid plays with toy trucks
in the basement bare concrete
sara empties the dryer
sara sits on the floor with cid putting numbered tiles on a plastic multiplication table
where does go
how long can you not sleep
i dont know awhile
thats a good question
wheres it go
we should help joe watch
cause he cant stay awake all the time
he isnt our business
hes keeping us safe baby
lets do this now
you have there i know you know this one
i want to help him
sara is distracted by a distant bell like dinging
she goes to the window looks out nervous
but its just a loose laundry line down in the yard whipping in the wind against its metal pole
in the distance joe paces the yard
relieved sara returns to cid
he sets the tile petulant
eight times three is what
eight times three is what
i want you to count three eights
are you telling me you want alone time
why dont you put that where it belongs
deliberately cid lifts the tile and sets it straight back down on the same spot
then like a knife in a fist fight hes protecting us cause you cant do it
i told you to stay away from i never did anything do you think im stupid
i told you already cid is building into a temper tantrum fast
you do what i tell you you cant tell me what to do youre not my mom
a deadly beat youre not my mom
youre a liar and youre gonna get killed and you wont stop lying
cid lunges at her sara slaps him back
not hard but cid scoots back eyes furious
youre a liar
i hate you because youre lying
i hate you
youre lying to me
sara scoots back
cid stands balls his fists screaming at her
sara pushes back away from him
maybe a cloud passed over the sun
the room darkens
and we see it now in her eyes sara is afraid
she bolts out of the room
sara walks fast down the hall not slowing through her bedroom into her walk in closet to a huge steel safe tucked in back
she opens the safe with trembling hands
and climbs inside
closes the heavy door
turns on a small led light
cids screams distant but not lessening
cids screams from the house clear as day
joe paces in front of the barn
turns his head back towards the house not sure what to think
the screams stop
joe turns uneasily back to the swaying corn
the math game scattered numbered tiles everywhere
cid lies face down on the bed cried out
sara enters quietly
sits on the bed beside him
strokes his hair
he folds into her and theyre holding each other tight
a gat man named canady strolls out of a donut shop coffee in hand and gets in his car
canady starts the car up starts driving
somehow not seeing kid blue crouched clear as day in the passenger side foot well
canady sees him jumps and yelps
the sedan swerves scrapes to a stop against a parked car
jesus fuckin kid blue what the pull into that alley
you get the fuck outta you dont wanna be seen with me canady pull in the alley
canady glares at him but pulls the car into a narrow alley parks it
the fuck are you still doing in town abe wants you dead man all abe wants right now is the looper
unless he got him last night
no we didnt get him
spotted and lost him
west end near whores alley
that area mott talbott little working girl colony
has a thought whores alley
you shoulda left town man
im gonna bring him in get right with abe
yeah maybe you bring him the looper but short of that abe dont get right with priced men
i got a price
canady locks the car doors
and in that one moment kid blue pulls canadys gun from his holster
holds it on him
a tense moment
course id never turn a friend for bang and the drivers side window explodes outward bloody
a moment then kid blue stumbles out holding his ears in pain
off down the alley and out of sight
sara lies with cid both asleep
distant but sharp a bell ringing
its unmistakable this time
the dinner bell
saras eyelids flutter
the bell stops suddenly
she stands careful not to wake cid
sara rushes quietly down the stairs
through a doorway she sees the frog buzzer sitting on the living room coffee table
lit up and buzzing
she goes to the front door throws it open
and is face to face with a tall gat man named jesse
how can i help you
joe is nowhere in sight
you can start by accepting my apologies re the hour i hope i didnt catch you in supper
no thats fine
yours was the last house on my list today been walking between empty farms all day in the hot sun
thought id tick this off my list not have to come back tomorrow
whats this about
back in the house somewhere a screen door bangs
you alone here maam
my husband should be back from the city any time now
happy to hear
could i trouble you for some water
ill get some you can take the glass with you
actually maam my business tonight this ticking off the list business its gonna require me coming in
if thats alright
jesse shifts his weight and sara notices his heavy boot is now a few inches over the door jam
will you tell me what this is about
i will yes
can i come in
hanging above the door just over saras head the shotgun
possibilities whirling through her mind
silent decision and she steps aside to let him enter
joe slips in through the screen door gun in hand
freezes in the kitchen listening
im a deputized police officer were looking for an escaped criminal just doing a sweep
seen anyone through here the past two days vagrants
no vagrants are always passing but nobody near the house
footsteps as they walk deeper in the house
joe cant tell if theyre coming through the living room or hall
this man here
then at the last moment joe slips out the hallway door as they enter from the living room
sara leads jesse in holding a photograph of joe
she pours him some water
jesse hands her a second photograph
were looking for his father too similar look and build but late s
may or may not be travelling together
this one is a print out from a security camera in the bodega of old joe holding a gun on the checkout clerk
saras eyes linger on old joes photo side by side with joes
maybe making the connection were not sure
she tries to hand the photos back but jesse doesnt take them
he notices the toys on the table
kids with your husband
jesse pokes his head into the hallway just missing joe slipping through the hall and into the living room
he lifts his glass drinks
ill show you round the grounds then the house then you can be on your way
sara holds the screen door open for him
well start with the house
jesse strolls into the living room and we follow him
he sits on a couch taps on a small folding phone
sara follows him
eight you said
and your husband
just gotta check in
with the home office
this goddamn thing
this man dangerous
tween you me and a lamppost
but hes wanted
my boss has half the citys looking for him
half the city and me
and if you find him theres a helluva price
think on that if he comes by acting sweet
behind the couch joe crouches unseen
he looks up and sees cid in the foyer standing halfway down the stairs
if jesse turned his head he would see cid clear as day
joe motions for cid to get out
cid points to jesse makes a gun with his hand
joe shakes his head sharply motions get out
cid silently creeps down the stairs
he is in full sight of the living room but jesse doesnt look up from his phone
cid vanishes down the hall
jesse looks up stands
alright show me upstairs
the screen door in the kitchen creaks and bangs
jesse looks sharply at sara
drafts in the house
jesse is already moving fast to the kitchen
the instant jesse exits cid appears again in the hallway
opens a small door under the stairway and beckons joe
this door doesnt latch
it used to its busted
joe hesitates then silently dashes over and in
cid follows him in down steep concrete stairs
pulls the door closed behind them
jesse steps out into the hallway gun drawn
sara behind him
jesse walks to the thin wooden door
he looks at sara
whats down there
door mustve blown open
jesse opens the door then looks at sara gravely
first i have a family of my own back in the city and i want to see them again
second if anything happens to me and i dont report back to my boss people in fifteen minutes theyre gonna know i disappeared searching this house and inside of another
fifteen youll have an army of more mes kicking down your door
its a laundry room
jesse motions her first
bare concrete basement starkly lit by a hanging bulb
the only things in the basement are a small washer and dryer and a large canvas hamper the size of a fridge
nowhere else to go
jesse levels his gun at the hamper
you want to call out whoevers hiding in that hamper
if someone was hiding in the house thats what id do
but nobody is in the house
open it up
no i think im gonna put a shot through it just to be safe
he raises his gat
sara stiffens slightly
you wanna call him out
sara stays silent
a long beat
then sara strides over pulls the hamper open
she throws open the washer and dryer
she takes the bucket and shakes it upsidown dumping out the water shows him its empty
now if you promise not to wag your gun at my shoe rack ill show you upstairs then show you the fuck out
she storms up the stairs
a little cowed jesse holsters his gun and follows her
the water from the bucket flows in a small stream across the room and into a drain hole under the hamper
dark and earthy
cid leads joe with his flashlight
just outside the barn a trap door covered with earth opens two inches
joe and cid prop it open and peer out at the house
a deep large hole capped with a wooden trap door
joe squats cid stands
my granddad built it but he didnt tell anyone of us why
nanna said cuz he was nuts
thank you granddad
that wasnt the man
i know him thats whats funny
his names jesse
i like him
hell go away when he doesnt find me he wont hurt her
they watch in silence for awhile
in the distance jesse leaves the house alone and scopes the grounds before walking back towards the highway
my mom gave me up
i was younger than you
we were vagrants and she was alone for a long time i thought she was stupid for getting on the drug she was on it was bad stuff it probably
ended up killing her
but now i see she was so alone
and it was what she had
she sold me
to a panhandle gang
quickly silently we see four year old joe dragged into darkness by rough men screaming
then were back to the scene
but i got away
and i ran and i ended on a train sitting in the dark in an empty freight going to the city and i saw myself over and over killing those
men who bought me and who got my mom on what she was on
finding them and tearing them apart
saving my mom
but you didnt
a man in the city found me put a gun in my hand and gave me some things
i didnt have my mom anymore
i had my work my money
for my life
thats what id kill for
not something i dont have and cant ever get back
theres just men figuring out what theyd do to keep whats theirs what they got
thats the only kind of man there is
im not gonna let sara get killed
joe looks at him
wants to put his hand on his shoulder but doesnt
i think were clear
he opens the trap door climbs out
joe reaches down to help cid out
looking down at cid in a hole with a trap door
he grabs cids hand and lifts him out
sara comes out sees cid and her face breaks with relief
cid runs to her and in the distance they embrace
sara and joe share a look
joe quickly turns his eyes back to the corn fields
a tiny dark concrete room
kid blue watches a screen his hand on a toggle wheel
a security cam view of suzies apartment building upper landing
playback of last night
it scans quickly forward
the apartment super leans against the wall behind him counting money
all working girls yeah
this whole block
you wanna check those too i can arrange
on the screen suzie comes home
picks up her daughter from next door
kid blue keeps scanning
and an instant later old joe climbs the stairs
kid blue slows the playback
a lo joe
old joe goes up to the window his back to the wall
watches suzie through the window for a long while
kid watches him intently
then very suddenly without going inside old joe leaves
down the stairs shoving his gun in his jacket
im an arranger stranger
but you dont see what you wanna see no refunds
old joe vanishes down the street in a swarm of pixels
kid blue emerges from a passage into the parking lot
looks up at suzies apartment door
then down the street
a few drops of rain fall
driving on a highway along the beach
a few drops of rain on the windshield
old joe late s and his wife in intense conversation her hand on his
but i will
you want to i know that
but you wont
id do anything for you
youd kill for me youd take life for me
but i dont want that
you kill for what you love but someone loves the person you kill and it starts again
i dont want that
i cant love a killer
what would you give up for me
she smiles but does not believe him
old joe sees this
a moment in thought
the car screeches to a stop and old joe runs to the sea
throws his gun in the ocean
above the waters the sun breaks the clouds
he runs back to her
falls on her
he holds her face like the most precious thing in the world
rain beats against stained glass
old joe kneeling in a pew
fists clenched as if in prayer
he stands stumbles out
old joe walks down the sidewalk towards the side entrance to the theater
in plain sight
stops feet shy of the entrance at a street garbage can
he draws his gun and leans over to drop it into the can
he lets it dangle from his fingers above the trash can
his pocket watch hanging open from its chain
the picture of his wife inside
his gun slowly slipping from his grasp
with each spin of the watch the photo of his wife appears cloudier
gun on the tips of his fingers about to fall
then the photo is nearly gone
old joe staggering to his feet from a fight
weve seen this before its the identical scene to the previous flashback
but when he sees his wife for the first time whisps of fog grow blotting out the scene
deep in the fog are other backgrounds a street a house and unfamiliar faces
other eventualities clouding this one as it becomes less likely old joe will meet his wife and have this memory
old joe in bed with his wife
baby crying outside
then whisps of fog thickens obscuring them
the thrown gun splashes in the sea and old joe turns back to the beach
but where his wife was in the previous memory now there is the fog
a wall of it massive reaching to the sky
old joe dwarfed against it
caught between the roiling waves and this wall of nothingness falling towards him
the gun on his fingertips
about to fall
a moment of decision
sara lies in bed
eyes wide open
still and quiet in the dark
her hand moves over her bare leg
slides across the sheets
finds the frog buzzer lying next to her
a moment of hesitation
then she pushes it
her eyes go to the window
a long beat
then sound a door opening in the house below
quick footsteps approaching
her eyes follow them
the door flies open
joe gun in hand buzzer in the other
his eyes adjust to the dark
closes the door kisses him
the adrenaline in his head doesnt know where to go
dont wake cid
she pulls him to the bed lifting his shirt off
the rain starts to fall against the windows
lying beside each other
joe still stunned
sara smokes a real cigarette taking a deep joyful drag
she sets the lighter on her palm
it floats about a foot in the air spinning then drops
thats pretty good
in the city young guys would hit on me by floating fucking quarters i wouldnt tell a em i was tk but id keep their quarters down
one guy busted a blood vessel in his eye trying to get it up
you lied to me
she doesnt seem angry but deeply curious
joe sits up
but you protected cid
and i know youre not lying that youre gonna kill this guy your own self
even though hes protecting your future
hes protecting his future
when i came back after my sister died
cid was sitting on the porch i remember seeing him for the first time in two years
saw him on the porch
i drove up crying and i had been at a party in the city when i got the call i was wearing this ridiculous party dress
all my ridiculous shit
i dont know if he remembered me but he looked at me
i abandoned him
i abandoned my baby
maybe i cant be a mother to him is that something i cant get back
when he looked at me then on the porch he was mine again he was my son
i seen so many men in the city who i look in their eyes and theyre lost
whether he loves me back or not im gonna love my son i said
and hes never gonna get lost
joe sitting up still sara lying beside him maybe crying
he touches her hair
a door frame kicked open with all the violence in the world
old joe sweeps into the small apartment gun drawn
suzie cooking in a robe opens her mouth to scream
dont wake up your daughter
old joe trains the gun on her
she goes silent
at the kitchen table
quivering she does
he keeps the gun on her
do you know me
i dont know you
who are you
i need to tell you why im doing this
i gotta say it out loud to someone so i know
why youre doing what
joe sleeping alone in the bed
saras voice distant
she is calling him from downstairs
joe comes down the stairs half dressed
jesse holds sara at gunpoint in the living room
staring at joe with a cool lack of malice
i threw my gun away once
to get her love
and i was going to do it again now
because i know shed want me to
i was going to do it
and i saw then i saw her vanishing like how life probably goes when you die
thats what she was asking me to give up this time
who are you
and if i picked up the gun
if i made this sacrifice
life my life
given back to me
given back just like we were and she wouldnt know what i did to get it back
joe steps into the living room stands facing them
im unarmed jesse you can let her go
sara jesse heres the best shot with a gat ive ever seen when he lets you go you sit on the couch and dont do anything stupid
jesse lets sara go and trains the gat on joe
hes coming here jess

old joe stands walks towards the back hall
suzie screams no
and runs at him but he shoves her back hard
i know you got no options you take the one you got but joe you aint gettin right with no one
looper or no youre beyond saving
as long as abes got one gat man standing hell be hunting you till his dying day
joes face falling
old joe gun ready down the darkened hallway towards the door at the end with a rainbow on it
he puts his hand on the knob
were going now
were gonna go to my truck youre gonna creak
cid on the stairs sleepy eyed
jesse purely on instinct spins and draws on cid
cids pov jesses gun snapping like a snake barrel leveled at him
cid makes a strange shouting noise falls back
everything slows down
old joe pushes the door open
the room darkens
as if the sun passed behind a cloud
jesse realizes its a kid
lowers his gun
but cid is mid scream falling back his foot misses the step and he tumbles down the stairs
confused terrified falling
joe runs into the foyer to catch cid
sara runs behind him
the room is very dark now
knick knacks around the room rattle then lift into the air
all of them
saras lighter on the coffee table it rises into the air
old joe readies his gun staring into the blackness
but his eyes lower
he touches his temple
fog clears joe is almost to cid who is still tumbling nearly at the bottom of the stairs
but just before he reaches him sara shoves joe from behind
shoving him towards the front door
hes confused but her face is set
cid hits the hardwood floor of the foyer face contorted with rage now hand raised to jesse palm outstretched
his scream louder than it should be
bigger things in the living room rise off the ground
he rises five feet in the air terrified
sara pulls joe through the front door and he looks back and sees jesse suspended in the air and cid on the ground screaming like an animal and just as
they cross the threshold jesse explodes in a bright red fan of blood
old joes face
frozen in a tableau cid screaming raw power
a bright red fan
joe and sara fall out and down the stairs
the front door and windows explode in a burst of splinters and glass
old joes eyes lift
a bare bulb hanging from the ceiling turns on
a six year old girls room
but the only person in it is kid blue
he shoots old joe with a blue tazer
old joe hits the ground mouth foaming paralyzed
knowing the answer now knowing the who and the how but helpless and defeated
kid blue kicks him in the face
a gat man circles a spot on the map in red ink saras farm
lost his signal five minutes ago right after he sent word he had him
abe slumps in a chair taking oxygen from a tank
call everyone every gat man in the city call a em here
gather em all up here first
no mistakes this time
were gonna take an army to that farm all at once and sweep it like hellfire
from a high vantage point
cars bikes gat men on foot all heading towards the club
an army all meeting at the belle aurore
massing to attack
moments after the blast
joe and sara lie in the dirt
jesses truck parked nearby
joe stirs first
the front door jam is splintered
he goes inside
sara gets up staggers in after him
joe bursts out of the screen door holding his blunderbuss and wiping off jesses gat
bloody cid sized footprints lead out the screen door and streak across the lawn into the corn
sara comes out after joe sees him heading for the corn
what are you doing with those guns
what are you going to do
she lunges for him wild
wrenches his arm and he spins throwing her to the ground
how did your sister die
sara holds his gaze
then everything breaks inside her and she collapses in sobs
that happened to her
jesus he killed her this breaks sara out of her sobs no
no he was climbing a bookshelf it fell back on him
he has no control he gets scared it explodes
what is it a tk mutation
joe someday hell learn to control it
yeah i know he will
imagine what he could do
if he did good with it
if he grew up good
joe heads to the corn sara scampers after him but slips on the wet grass and joe hits the corn with a head start
you stay away from him
she runs into the corn
with sara as she stumbles blindly through the tall stalks
make a noise baby call to me
with joe through the corn following traces of blood on the stalks
you stay away from joe you come to me
tries cocking the gat but its broken
tosses it wields the blunderbuss
joe emerges from the corn
cid crouches at one end of the small clearing
he looks at joe
half covered in blood
hair matted over one eye
joe looks back at him
approaches him gun not raised but in hand
cid like a frightened animal
a long moment
and just like that joe puts his hand on cids head
cid leans against his legs crying
sara bursts into the clearing sees this
runs to cid and embraces him wiping the blood from his face
joe steps back
right now two things have happened
my looper knows cids the kid hes looking for and my gang knows im here
so in fifteen minutes one or both is coming down that highway
you pack up the gat mans truck whatever you can fit in ten minutes and you drive north away from the city
where are you going
joe takes the frog buzzer from his pocket presses it
saras buzzes in her pocket
one buzz means come and get me
two or nothing dont
he vanishes into the stalks towards the highway
crowded with gat men all preparing
we got everyone here
all our men
arm a em up lets go
abe turns annoyed and sees the security monitor
on the screen kid blue rips the sack off and holds old joes bloodied face up to the camera
i got him abe
i got him
the door buzzes open
kid pushes old joe through the long entrance hallway past a dozen gat men who watch him with shocked amazement
old joes hands bound back
kid blue glows
he comes to the tiny coat check room and big craig stops him then sees old joe
so both we got
just the looper
i got him
knew he went for whores so i checked every building
they found joe too though in a farm on the east side
thats why all the gats are here the whole crews arming up to make a sweep
joe fuck joe save your bullets i got the looper
not such a fuck up huh
im taking him up to this happens very fast old joe uses his legs to kick himself off the wall and back into kid blue slamming him against the opposite
old joe grabs behind his back kid blues gun and blasts one shot through the chains binding his wrists and into the kids midsection
he whips the gun from behind his back and shoots big craig in the face
then blasts the gat men in the entrance hallway while he reaches into the coat check and pulls an automatic rifle
he blasts like hell into the hallway
a few shots return but mostly the men are trapped
then its over
all is smoky still for a moment
old joe stares at the exit door ajar down the long hallway jammed with bodies
then at the passage that leads deeper into the club
a gat man runs in and old joe shoots him down
he steps into the coat check and loads his pockets with guns and grenades
then launches himself into passageway towards the club
old joe weaves his way through the backstage area chucking grenades in front of him then unloading his automatic rifle into the smoky aftermath
and with a mixture of dumb luck and skill from years of being gangland muscle takes out gat man after gat man
the corridors are tight twisty
old joe uses that
killing everyone he lays eyes on
wiping them out
all the bad guys
men maimed bleeding and crying dying the way people actually die from gunshots
old joe forges on deeper
old joe kicks the door open
takes it in the office
hammer on the desk
he reloads a gun
eyes find the door to abes inner den
abe and two gat men guns out crouched behind the table
watching the door
a display screen shows old joe on the other side
abe eyes dull
shouts at the door joe
guess i put the gun in that kids hand huh joe
guess everything comes back around
like your goddamn ties
closes the gun
joe breaks out of the corn panting
he steps out into the middle of the highway
storm clouds on the horizon
he cleans and readies his blunderbuss
kid blues eyes flutter open
he lifts himself painfully
checks his chest
most of the shot caught his shoulder his chest is grazed
the gat men in the hall
kid blue wanders the smoky halls
dead and dying men
abe shot once in the head twice in the chest
kid blue stands over them
tears well in his eyes
then on the wall he sees the map
the farm circled in red
clothes and boxes piled in the back of jesses truck
sara loads one last bundle
calls to cid in the front seat
ok baby were going
then a cloud of dust on the distant highway
the cloud gets closer
it is a truck
an armored truck
its the armored truck that kid blue loaded his gold bricks into
the front windshield blown in
the truck stops fifty feet away and old joe steps out
he throws a gold bar which lands in the dusty highway between them
you take this truck you take your money and you go live your life
no ones coming after you
i fixed it
and you go kill the boy
thats how you fix it
you got your life back you better think right now about what thats worth to you
joe raises his blunderbuss and fires
too far away the shot scatters
the old man flinches backs away
joe walks forward towards old joe stepping over the gold
stupid little shit
you let him live hes gonna take away everything thats yours everything thats mine
you seen what the boys gonna become
i havent seen that yet
joe fires again close enough now to draw blood off old joes chest and knock him back
out of nowhere a slat bike careens around the van which has until now blocked our line of sight down the highway
the bike clips joes leg sending him spinning violently to the dusty pavement
the bike shoots off down the highway a cloud of dust in its wake
it takes a hundred yards for the kid to pull it to a stop and spin it around
joe is hurt bad
he grapples for his blunderbuss
kid blue guns the engine gat in hand
levels it steady as a rock
joe shoots at the kid but hes out of range the gun fires scattershot
kid blue fires a bullet hits dangerously close to joe
panicked joe begins firing at the pavement around him round after fiery round
kicking up dust
lots of dust
raising a cloud
kid blues pov zooming towards joe now obscured in a cloud of dust and smoke
he fires his gat into the cloud tries to slow the bike but cant in time
in the dust cloud joe hears the bike roaring down upon him
he covers up and when he feels the bike roaring past blindly fires his buss
a moment later the bike emerges from the dust cloud
without a driver
it skids crashes
when the dust clears away joe lies still arms over his head
besides him the broken remains of kid blue
painfully joe raises himself
then realizes old joe is gone
sara starts the truck up
here we go
give it a wave goodbye
they roll down the dirt road that leads to the highway
at the far end of it at a distance but walking towards them is the dark figure of old joe
gun in hand
sara hesitates a minute then guns it
straight for him
duck down baby stop please he can shoot us just stay down half the distance closed but hes still far off
a shot cracks the front grill another cracks the windshield
the truck lurches horribly and flips straight back in a graceful arc landing upsidown
sara and cid dazed hanging by their seatbelts
are you ok
im sorry in the rear view mirror sara sees old joe getting closer
cmon baby we have to run now
she unfastens them and they both climb out and old joe stops suddenly taking aim
sara pulls cid behind the flatbed for cover as two bullets glance off the overturned truck
were going into the fields
i want you to run ill be right behind you dont look back
old joe lowers his gun and runs towards them
they both sprint off the road
the wide bare field
cid runs ahead towards the corn sara not far behind
the earth soft their feet sink in like a nightmare
old joe crosses the road and chases them onto the field firing at them on the run
bullets thunk in the earth
sara stumbles exhausted
cid turns about thirty feet ahead of her
old joe stops running and steadies his gun
a distant gunshot crack
a fan of crimson blood sprays from cids head
his neck twists and he crumples to the ground
sara is stopped in her tracks by an invisible force
no cid no
the topsoil of the earth around them rises in a fine dust
old joe reacts as the topsoil rises an eerie moment
sara struggles to reach cid but is still about twenty feet behind him
cid raises his head
the bullet grazed his jawline
not severe but lots of blood
cids eyes locked hateful on old joe
blood soaks his shirt
far behind him the barn splinters apart as if in a tornado
with a sudden jolt the field ripples out from cid like a stone thrown in a pond
sara lifts into the air
old joe is hefted off the ground
his gun falls
joe struggling through the fields limping desperate
something like a furious wind rushes through the stalks
intense eyes dark in another place
old joe suspended mid air realizes whats about to happen
he lifts his hand defensively and screams cids face straining about to scream
cids focus adjusts from old joe to sara
she floats reaching out to him
yelling something he cant hear but he can see her eyes
cids face breaks
he barely mouths the word and everything falls
sara old joe the earth
all comes crashing down
the corn stalks shiver then are still
joe breaks out of the stalks and onto the field
gasping for breath
gets his bearings
in the far distance across the field old joe sara and cid
cid runs to sara who sits up slowly
you did good baby
you did so good
i love you
behind them old joe struggles to his feet
sara kisses cid
into the fields
run now baby
no no mom no you go
she pushes him away and cid runs
then she turns
standing her ground
directly between old joe and cid
old joe trips in the mud fumbles his gun
sees cid approaching the safety of the corn stalks
blocked by sara
still too far away struggling as fast as he can helpless as old joe closes in on sara
he fires his buss at old joe but is way out of range
old joe gets his gun rises with it
cid about to hit the stalks
sara between them
cid nears the corn fields running
seconds from safety
pocket watch wrapped around it
his wifes picture in it
clear as day
no time to move around sara
now or never
joe running useless gun in hand
sara not going anywhere
im sorry he pulls the trigger
watching everything is a little surreal
old joe shoots sara
we hear no gunshot
just the wind in the corn and young joes breathing
she falls giving him a clear shot at cid
just as old joe gets him in his sights cid breaches the corn fields and is gone vanishing in the stalks
old joe lowers his gun stunned but still frantic
he stumbles towards the corn still far off his face breaking
trips falls in the mud
corn field vast in front of him
cid is gone
he lost him
he holds his pocket watch
on the horizon a train
cid sits in a darkened car holding a bloody rag to his jaw
joe watching seeing cids face
his eyes full of hate
the train rumbles towards the dark city
sees in his minds eye all of this
and through all of this we have only heard the wind
and joe breathing
time hanging slowed nearly to a stop
a moment of decision
joe turns his blunderbuss back on himself and fires
revealing that all we saw was in joes head and we are still in the moment where old joe is about to shoot sara
but this time just as hes pulling the trigger a distant shot is heard
and old joe disappears
sara stands shell shocked just for a moment
then she doesnt process any of it she just turns and yells cid stops just shy of the corn
turns back to the field
theres his mom sara unharmed and smiling
the bad man is gone
the field is empty
we dont see joe but far across the field cid runs to his mom into her arms
sara lifts him holds him
she carries him
walking fast back towards a far distant figure lying still on the edge of the field
then a faint buzz
the flasher in her pocket
she pulls it out
looking at him far away
he had to go away baby
he took the bad man with him
she kisses him
in the distance sara turns away and carries cid back towards the farmhouse
sara bathes cid dresses the wound on his jaw
she tucks cid in holds him close
kisses his forehead
sara emerges from the ruined front door crosses the porch
sara crosses the lawn and walks across the field
sara goes to him slowly
she kneels beside him
his pocket watch in the dirt
no photo inside
around and around
she closes it
touches his hair
the wind through the corn
after a long while the sun breaks through the clouds
