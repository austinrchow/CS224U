b if window
href b b blow a majestic panorama of the lush green slopes that are the columbian highlands
a faint chopping sound is heard and then another
the view changes and tiny dots appear on the hillside vegetation
we realize the dots are people
workers swinging long steel machetes in slow methodical rhythm
we see the south american indian men clearly now
their tar stained teeth
their gaunt faces riddled with crows feet
their jaws chewing away on huge wads of coca leaves as they collect the harvest
old rickety trucks carrying the huge green tractor sized bales speed along the narrow road
the bundles are undone and columbian women separate out the leaves
tribes of underweight workers carry armload after armload of the harvest and ritualistically dump them into a gigantic cannibal pot which sits on top of a raging bonfire
the leaves are being boiled down and a huge plume of smoke streaks the sky
wizened indios brave the heat and shovel ashes into the pot to cool the solution
a primitive but enormous makeshift lab contains all the equipment
the over sized vats
dark skinned bandoleros smoke cigarettes and sport automatic weapons at all the points of entry
the coca is now a basuco paste and is being sent in for a wash
a conveyor belt pours out brick after brick of pure cocaine hydrochloride
the bricks are wrapped tied up weighed and stamped with a p before being thrown into duffel bags
a small twin engine cessna is loaded with dozens of duffel bags and the plane takes off
the cessna touches down
the worksite is busy
george is amongst other workers working a summer job
as george is taking five he looks across the sight to fred who is sweeping up debris
a long way from being the boss
george stands in line to register for college wearing his brooks brothers suit bowtie and freshly bryllcreamed hair
the room is crowded and the line is long
bob dylans subterranean homesick blues blares out of one of the kids transistor radios
george looks around the room
he is uncomfortable
he catches his reflection in the shiny glass partition and stops
he doesnt like what he sees
something is not right
he looks like everyone else
same cookie cutter hair same cookie cutter clothes same cookie cutter faces
hes a carbon copy
its georges turn but he doesnt hear it
twenty years of schooling and they put you on a day shift
the words hit him like a tone of bricks as he continues to stare at his own reflection
i was standing there and it was like the outside of me and the inside of me didnt match you know
and then i looked around the room and it hit me
i saw my whole life
where i was gonna live what type of car id drive who my neighbors would be
i saw it all and i didnt want it
not that life
george sits with fred
its breaktime and fred eats from a lunch box
theres something out there for me dad
something free form you know
something for me and college just isnt it
thats too bad
you would have been the first one in the family
you want me to get your old job back
because i could you know i could put in that word
i dont want to
i mean i just dont want
its obvious to fred that his son doesnt want to be like him
what are you going to do
im going to california
george and tuna now years old struggle with their bags
their new place is a tackily furnished two story apartment with small balconies and a view of the ocean
as george and tuna struggle with the bags two california beauties appear on the balcony next door barbara buckley and maria you guys need some help
george and tuna share a look
i dont know about you but i think were gonna like it here
barbara and maria introduce george and tuna around to the manhattan beach regulars
they are immediately accepted despite their ill fitting shorts and tunas unhip black socks
the beach scene is one big party
lots of beer music bikinis and good times
by the end of the day george and tuna have a hundred new friends
california was like nothing id ever experienced
the people were liberated and independent and full of new ideas
they used words like right on groovy and solid
the women are all beautiful and seemed to share the same occupation
im a flight attendant
im a flight attendant
im a flight attendant
the weed comes out and is passed around
in slow motion barbara takes a huge hit of grass grabs georges face french kissing him and giving him a huge shotgun
george and barbara are sleeping late
their bodies intertwined beneath the sheets
a slam of the front door wakes them up
hey wake up
come on you two lovebirds
hurry i want to show you something
george and barbara shake cobwebs out and stumble into the kitchen to find tuna holding a brown paper shopping bag
figured it out
figured what out
you know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money
being how we dont want to get jobs and whatnot
well check this out
tuna takes the paper bag and empties its contents on the kitchen table
its a grey mound of stocky seedy marijuana
barbara examines the reefer
tuna this is crap
i know its not the greatest
you got ripped off pal

i got it all figured out
we make three finger lids and sell them on the beach

george barbara and tuna stop outside the front door

a beauty parlor for men
sounds pretty queer
they walk in
george tuna and barbara enter
the whipping post is californias first male hair salon
george looks around at the customers being pampered
haircuts pedicures manicures
nothing like this back home
derek foreal is a curious man
daringly effeminate especially for the sixties he is always surrounded by beautiful women
as he sees barbara he stops his haircut and runs to embrace her
dereks female entourage rush over as well
kisses all around
so this is the new man huh
george and tuna stick out there hands
tuna oh my

derek pulls a television sized brick of quality marijuana out from under a sink and sets it down in front of george

george and tuna look at each other

summer on the beach

they smoke pot and drink brews
george and barbara get close as do tuna and maria
slowly georges clothes and hair start to look better cooler
george and tuna hanging out with the surfers
george and tuna hang with barbara maria and some girlfriends in bikinis
george and barbara hang together at the life guard stand
george and tuna on the strand with hippy professors selling half ounces
derek tuna george barbara maria and the elves play volleyball
barbecue at belmont shores apartment with george barbara derek tuna maria and different elves
george and tuna sell half ounces to bikers
derek is having a party out of a mini van in the beach parking lot
george barbara tuna and maria are there
george and barbara sit by the water watching the waves crash into the sand
the sky is streaked with purple and red

there are a hundred thousand rich kids with their parents money to spend but theres never anything available

derek george and barbara sit around
the blinds are drawn
the way we figure it barbara flies to boston twice a week
two bags per flight
twenty five pounds in each bag
youre kidding right
thats a hundred pounds a week
yeah i know its a lot of weight
were gonna call it california sinsemilla
im telling you derek it will sell
i dont know
heres the best part
we can charge five hundred a pound
come on george no one is going to pay that
its already been negotiated
the money is there waiting
derek looks at barbara
goodness is right
if you do the math thats over thirty grand a week profit
i want you to be my partner on this derek
thats fifteen thousand a week for you my friend
in your pocket free and clear
and i only deal with you
barbara and me
no one else
derek thinks about it
its gonna work derek
i dont know
it all sounds pretty risky
shes a flight attendant
they dont check her bags
george drops barbara off in her uniform curbside
they kiss and she walks away with two big red samsonites
she checks them with a skycap and tips him
a huge jet goes right to left through frame
barbara is greeted by kevin dulli with a hug
a baggage claim check is slipped into kevins hand
keep it coming
we see barbaras two red samsonites being taken off the belt by kevin
same scene repeated except different clothes on all
maybe kevin is dressed a little better
the same scene repeated same things changed again now kevin is definitely dressed a little better
i need more
what do you want me to do
i can only take two bags and i cant fly back here everyday
i know but ive got a feeding frenzy on my hands
tell george this is small potatoes
were missing out on some serious cash
you tell george
hell think of something
tuna drives the big winny
maria rides shotgun
barrelling cross country its a party on wheels
kevin and his girl rada are the welcoming committee as the rv pulls into the parking lot
they wave slap the sides of the winnebago and greet the prodigal sons with hugs and handshakes
georges room is rustic and plush
a log fire burns and empty champagne bottles adorn the surroundings
the girls have taken to each other
the music is loud and they dance while the boys do business
kevin counts out the money
its stacked in piles all over the table
twenty forty sixty eighty nine
twenty forty sixty eighty a thousand
its all there
a hundred and twenty eight thousand dollars
jesus christ im getting a boner just looking at it
but george isnt paying attention
his wheels are turning
whats the matter george
you look like you just fucked your mother
cheer up man
half this money is ours
were fucking rich
its not enough
what the fuck are you talking about man
the set up is wrong

were getting middled
so we need to get to the source
what about derek
hes getting middled too
and dereks our partner
whats good for us is good for him
so we need a source
where do we start
who speaks spanish
we pan off the beautiful waters of puerto vallarta
this is a local beach on a saturday afternoon
the girls on the beach are drinking coco locos and swimming
george with a bartender
tuna and dulli with cabbies
george and derek talking with a local man ramon at a corner bar
barbara maria and rada talk with local girls
this is bullshit george

we stick out like sore thumbs
i dont think so
you guys are such babies

george well wind up in a mexican prison getting fucked up the ass by one of marias relatives
hey fuck you dulli

he grabs maria runs and does a huge belly flop into the water
they all laugh
george and barbara with local musicians on the beach
george and derek at a cab stand
george talks with a bellboy in the lobby of a local hotel
george barbara tuna derek maria kevin and rada are at the bar
ramon comes up to george they briefly discuss and george follows him out of the bar
george and ramon climb into a beat up v
bug and take off
fields and farms
bug pulls up to an old ranch
they get out of the bug and are greeted by santiago and his ramon tells me you are looking for some mota
yes i am
santiago moves to a tarp and pulls it back to reveal many bales of green seedless sinsemilla
for instance something like this
ill take it
ha ha ha
you are funny
really how much will you be needing
all of it
as much as youve got
a couples thousand pounds
ill be back in a week with a plane
listen americano it is very nice to meet you but maybe we are going too fast
you take a little and then come back
i dont need a little
i need a lot
marijuana is illegal in my country and i believe in yours as well
we must be careful
what if i brought you lets say fifty thousand dollars
would that eliminate some of your concerns
amigo you bring me fifty thousand dollars and i have no more concerns
a pair of boltcutters snaps the chain off a single engine cessna
i cant believe were stealing a plane
dont be such a pussy
were not stealing it
were borrowing it
and try to look natural
weve got company
a mechanic working on the adjacent plane is giving them the hairy eyeball
the three boys nod their heads in acknowledgement and give a small wave
the mechanic smiles and waves back
the engine is on and the propeller is spinning
kevin is at the controls
tuna is not making the trip
he pokes his head in before shutting the cockpit
you guys are fucking insane
george reads from a flight manual
alright pull back the throttle
the engine screams
not that far only halfway
you sure you know what youre doing
ive flown with my old man a million times
and he always told me the taking off part is easy its the landing youve got to worry about
the plane tries to land
its a clumsy one
the cessna is tipping and touching first one wheel then another almost sideways before straightening out and stopping
george and kevin hop out of the plane
they are greeted by santiago and the mexican contingency
george hands out presents to everyone
hes like santa claus giving gifts to every man woman and child
they love him
santiago pumps georges hand
good to see you jorge
you are a man of your word
actually ive got some news
that fifty thousand i promised you i couldnt get it
george throws santiago a duffel bag
so i brought you sixty
rada sits in the winnebago and keeps flashing the headlights
barbara tuna and maria stand on top of the winnebago waving big white towels
the plane descends from the sky and touches down making another extremely shaky landing
its on the water and beautiful
the furnishings are distinctly derek foreal
its a surreal scene
the holiday decorations are up topless women in elf outfits sip champagne and a thousand pounds of cannabis lays on the living room floor
are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone
dont be ridiculous these are my babies
george empties the pot all over the floor
george youre a genius
the girls dive on top of derek caressing and kissing him
george get my camera
derek poses with a load of marijuana like its a new fur
take a picture of me george
take a picture of me with my new friends
itll be a fabulous christmas card
a mexican real estate agent shows barbara and george a sprawling villa in puerto vallarta
white marble on the water
george looks at barbara
should we buy it
are you kidding
well take it
the team is there
all of them
george barbara kevin rada tuna maria and derek with a couple of new senorita friends
they all wear identical mexican sombreros
a mexican boy approaches them with a camera
they pose their arms thrown around each other in camaraderie and flash
the picture freezes and we dissolve
george is taking barbara and his parents out to dinner
the buggy whip is ermines favorite
i just cant get over the size of that ring
i just love it
fred look at it
tell me you dont love that ring
im just happy that george has found someone he cares for
but im talking about that ring
its something else
let me tell you
george has exquisite taste
what is that two carats
thats got to be two carats
i dont know
its at least two carats darling
hard to imagine being able to afford a ring like that on a construction salary
all eyes turn to george who fumbles
well you know
oh shut up fred
shut your big fat mouth
you dont buy it all at once
its called layaway
something you wouldnt know anything about you cheapskate
whos the cheapskate
you you big old tightwad
he still has his communion money
tell him george
tell your father about layaway
the boy is happy fred
dont be such a killjoy
george looks to barbara whose nose is bleeding
honey your nose
oh my g d im so sorry
barbara here take my napkin
ill be okay
you wanna split
yeah i dont feel so well
okay guys were gonna leave
lets get the check
george and barbara exit the restaurant
are you sure youre okay
i feel like shit
me and my frigging nosebleeds
im taking you to the doctor when we get home and i dont want to hear any arguments
would you be bummed out if i didnt go to chicago with you
no not at all
you fly home and get some rest
nice first impression
a nose bleed in front of your parents
oh my g d how embarrassing were they
i wanted to shoot myself
oh they werent that bad
i mean they were kind of cute
promise me that well never be like them
i dont want to wind up like that
were going to wind up like us
mug shots of george
left right center
george sits handcuffed to a chair
piles of marijuana bricks roll past him
i had a little problem in chicago
something about trying to sell a truckload of dope to an undercover officer
so i applied the three rules of the game under if and when arrested
george and his court appointed attorney stand before the judge at the arraignment
rule one dont fight
a trial will cost you a fortune in lawyers fees and the jury will chop off your balls and hand them to you on a platter
george jung you have been accused of possession of six hundred and sixty pounds of marijuana with intent to distribute
how do you plead
rule two plead not guilty and get bailed out of jail
your honor id like to say a few words to the court
the court appointed attorney puts his head in his hands
by all means
in all honesty i dont feel like what ive done is a crime and i think its illogical and irresponsible for you to sentence me to prison
none of the real criminals of the world ever end up behind bars
i mean when you think about it what did i really do
cross an imaginary line with a bunch of plants
you say that im an outlaw you say that im a thief but wheres the christmas dinner for the people on relief
george stops when his attorney stamps on his foot
the court officers roll their eyes and the judge smiles
those are very interesting concepts you have mr
unfortunately for you the imaginary line you crossed is real the plants you brought with you are illegal and what you did constitutes a crime
the judge slams his gavel
bail is set at twenty thousand dollars
george walks out free on bond to find barbara waiting for him
she doesnt look so good
baby you didnt have to come
what and miss all the fun
cmon not a chance
so whats the verdict
lawyer says he can plead it down to five years
ill serve two
george i cant wait that long
youre not going to wait for me
george i went to the doctor
i dont have two years
which brings me to rule number three which says fuck rules one and two skip bail and take off
george hits the gas and the car screams down the road
george and barbara sit on the veranda drinking champagne and watching the sun go down over the pacific
barbara is completely bald
rail thin eyes sunken
but it doesnt matter
theyre having a great time
they laugh and hold hands and laugh some more
everyone is there
all in black
barbaras casket is lowered into the ground and george climbs to his knees to push the first dirt on the grave
time is such a funny thing
i look at where i am now and in here time inches along
so slow it hardly seems like it moves
but back then time went fast
george pushes dirt along the edge of a flower root
still planting those sunflowers he presses down firmly standing before him is barbara still beautiful and young with flowing locks
george raises his hand and makes a small wave
barbara opens and closes her hand
it went too fast
george looks down and barbara is gone
george hops the fence like he did when he was a boy and goes in the back door
ermine looks at george blankly
ermine just keeps looking at him
surprised to see me
take your boots off
we heard all about it
i want you to know im deeply sorry about your girlfriend
she was very pretty
have you been getting the money i sent you
you mean the drug money
yes i got it
ermines hands are trembling
she is emotional
she hugs george ferociously not letting go
g d son
george turns around to see freds beaming face
george and fred sit at the table a bottle of scotch sits between them
the glasses are raised
may the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face
and the winds of destiny carry you aloft
to dance with the stars
the glasses clink and the drinks are sucked down
the bottle is dwindling
george and fred are feeling it
you loved her didnt you
you really loved her
i really did
what am i gonna do
the glasses are refilled
you mad at me
yeah you are
i can tell by the way you look at me
i just dont know what youre thinking
i dont understand your choices
you know the police are looking for you
im great at what i do dad
i mean im really great
let me tell you something son
you would have been great at anything
something outside catches georges eye
george is up and on the move
where are you going
the front door opens and federal agents pour into the house
george is up the stairs in a flash
george slams the door behind him moves over to the window and opens it
out of options he folds
he moves to the corner and sits down turns on the train set
a knock on the door is heard
fbi agent james t
george jung you are under arrest
open the door son
they lead george outside in handcuffs
ermine and fred watch
i had no choice
george stops and looks at his mother for the first time realizing her betrayal
dont look at me like that
what was i supposed to do
youre in our house
what was i supposed to be an accomplice
as george is led to the police car ermine follows
you dont think people know youre a drug dealer
its no secret
how do you think that reflects on me
every time i go out im humiliated
i see the stares
i hear the whispers
how do you think that makes me feel
did you ever once stop and think of me
georges head is pushed down as he is put in the squad car
he looks up at his mother
so you go to jail
its for your own good
you need to straighten your life out
george is being led through a series of gated corridors
as he walks he takes in the faces of the other inmates
he arrives at his cell and notices he has a roommate
the cell door opens and george steps inside
there are books and papers spread out over both bunk beds
george watches as his cellmate quickly clears everything off the top bunk
apparently the papers are private
george puts his things down and the little man proffers his hand
he is dark polite and colombian
my name is diego delgado
how do you do
george pushes his tray through the cafeteria line
diego is behind him
if you dont mind me asking what is the reason you are in this place
why are you here
i dont want to talk about it
would you like to know my crime
not really no
i dont like a lot of conversation diego
too much blah blah blah blah is no good
but we are roommates okay
and we must talk to each other
i am arrested for stealing cars
for the grand theft auto
so now it is your turn
now you will tell me okay
you will tell me why you are here
george says nothing
he keeps eating his food
oh come on george
if we are to be friends we must trust each other
george lays on his bunk smoking
diego is on the bottom bunk furiously writing on a notepad
he flips through his books and rustles his papers
george peeks over the side to see what diego is doing
what do you got there diego
just a little project
what kind of project
not for you to worry
i thought you said we were roommates
that we should talk about everything
you have your intrigues
i have mine
this is a happy day for me george
nine months from today i will be in medellin sipping champagne
in nine months i am free
how much time do you have
twenty six months
twenty six months
i must be your lawyer
ive got to get out of here diego
only two ways i know to leave here early
one is to escape
whats the other one
george is trying to teach basic education to the inmates
the room mostly black and hispanic is hostile
they dont want to learn
alright lets open our books
man fuck you
we aint opening shit
you just the wardens boy
we on to you
you just trying to knock some time off asskissing motherfucker
diego watches as the room reacts with laughter
this aint going to be easy
i want to get out of this shithole as fast as i can
and i dont want to do this any more than you do
but for me to walk early some of you have to graduate
you forget about it
youre hopeless go to sleep
the room laughs again
damn homeboy you got ruined
but the rest of you could get diplomas and get jobs when youre on the outside
the room looks at him
they aint buying it
shit im in for life
im a criminal
i aint getting no motherfucking job
we can learn some criminal shit too
alright ill make you a deal
what if half the time we learn about george washington and the other half ill teach you how to smuggle drugs
man you dont know dick about smuggling no drugs
i was arrested in chicago with six hundred and sixty pounds of grass
i think that qualifies me
diego looks up from his desk suddenly very interested
how did you get a hold of six hundred and sixty pounds of dope
flew it in from mexico on a single engine cessna
now do we have a deal or not
alright the first thing you need to know about smuggling drugs is that its easy
the dea are a bunch of losers
they couldnt find their dicks in a whorehouse
they dont know what the fuck theyre doing
diego watches george winning over the room
he listens intently to georges every word
his wheels are turning
diego and george lay in their cots
george is tired
diego is not
i listen to what you say to the class today about the smuggling
you are a magico ah
george doesnt respond
i never believed you were a murderer
i knew you are a magico
i have seen it in you
its in your spirit
im tired diego
go to bed
you like to make the boundaries disappear
its not only the money is it george
the adventure is part of the victory
its the thrill ah
in my country i am a magico
a man with a dream
a man on the rise
to take nothing and make it something okay
i have failed my dream but i will accomplish
that is why i am in your country
yes i lose my freedom
but they do not take my dream
do you have a dream george
i would if i could get some sleep
yes you have a dream
and maybe you accomplish your dream
but yet you failed
because i got caught
no my brother
because they caught me
you failed because you had the wrong dream
diego climbs off his bunk and looks george square in the eye
what do you know about cocaine
i dont know diego
ive got a good thing going already
everybody smokes pot
cocaine is a rich mans drug
its too expensive
that is where you are wrong
for us it is cheap
in medellin we buy for six thousand dollars a kilo
in miami we sell for sixty
georges interest is piqued
thats over fifty thousand dollars profit per kilo
and thats wholesale
cut it a few times and retail youre looking at two three hundred thousand
oh my g d
and a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana
everything is the same george except instead of thousands you are making millions
jesus fucking christ
now do you see what i am saying
getting it here is no problem
ill fly it in myself if i have to
what about supply
how much can we get
we will talk of everything
we have the time
you arrive here with a bachelor of marijuana but you will leave with a doctorate of cocaine
diego and george pouring over diegos plans
discussing planning plotting
what type of planes do you have
four passenger single engine cessna
how many kilos can we fit in these planes
i dont know
a hundred hundred and fifty
how many miles is it from colombia to miami
well have to stop somewhere to refuel
well refuel in the bahamas
i know someone there
i love the bahamas
george is at a payphone
he drops in about a million quarters until he is finally connected
diego delgado please
today is the day ah
are you out
yeah im out
ive been waiting for you
how are we doing
everything is fine down here
everything is all set up
do we need a plane
how does this work
when do i see you
slow down george
fred exits the liquor store carrying two bottles of dom perignon
as he catches georges eye he lifts the bottles showing them off
george holds up his finger indicating hell be just a second
you need to come down here everybody meets everybody
ho ho ho
ha ha ha
we do one for good faith and then we talk about airplanes
i cant go anywhere diego
im on parole
i cant leave the state
but you must
its the only way
i just got released five minutes ago
george are we gonna do this or not
george steps outside and spots diego
their eyes meet
diego looks different relaxed
he wears a straw hat shorts and sports a healthy tan
the two men embrace
good to see you diego
look around you
its better than danbury no
i have some friends i would like you to meet
diego and george sit with five other colombians most notably a man named cesar roza
the mood is not friendly
seven and a half in each suitcase
you receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery
not so fast
i would like to go over the details
i put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs
tell me about the suitcases
what is the make and the color
cesar thinks about it
will there be clothes in the suitcase
my clothes your clothes
what does it matter
i would like to know the contents
every detail is important
what are we doing here diego
this guys a clown
hes talking about clothes
i demand to know everything
i do not trust six hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone i dont know
its a lousy fifteen kilos
i piss fifteen kilos
the coca is my responsibility
youre a fucking amateur
there is no need to be impolite
cesar this will be fine
you have my word
george cesar is just being thorough
but just remember mr
i will be with you the whole way
and i will be watching
george carries the two samsonites over to customs inspections
its a long walk
georges heart beats hard
the sound is audible and grows with every beat
cesar lurks at the baggage carousel
when youre carrying drugs across the border the idea is to remain calm
the way i do it is to think of something pleasant a fun party a moment of triumph
a sexual encounter
i actually project myself to that place
anything to keep your mind off the fact that youre going to jail for a very long time if they find the fifteen kilos of cocaine in your suitcases
george stands in front of the customs agent
he tries his best to look relaxed as the agent reviews his documents
on vacation for only one day
the heartbeats are very loud
weak smile my brothers wedding
imagine that huh
georges breathing is labored and his swallowing reflex doesnt seem to be working
cesar passes through eyeballing george the whole time
open your bags please
george opens the samsonites
super dry mouth
the beats are deafening now
cesar nervously monitors the situation from the payphones
whose clothes are these
the customs agent holds up a womans undergarment
cesar throws up his hands in frustration
what can i tell you
george winks at the customs agent who shakes his head before finishing the inspection
alright go ahead
george moves to the payphones sets down the two suitcases and pretends to make a call
not inconspicuously cesar grabs the bags and walks quickly out of the terminal
diego cesar george and jack stevens a silver haired executive type lounge around the mini suite
cesar still has that crazy look in his eye
three hundred kilos it is then
a beautiful latin woman enters and kisses both diego and cesar
her name is inez and friendly she is not
has everyone met inez
this is george
ive told you about him
and this is friend jack stevens
the men proffer their hands but she just looks at them like ants before sitting down next to diego
try to be more respectful darling
but she is mistrustful of americans
shall we proceed
lets hear it again mr
ill fly down on a friday refuel in the bahamas and then to medellin
inez addresses diego and cesar only
she speaks in spanish
the conversation is about why friday
inez has some problem with it
and inez is reassured
we make the pick up refuel once more in the bahamas and fly back on sunday with the mom and pop traffic
why are you speaking
your responsibility is over
you do not fly
you are not a pilot
you are not a distributor
you introduced us to mr
stevens and the use of his airplane
that is all
you make a percentage
a generous one
and youre lucky to get that
padrino will pay ten thousand per kilo
for you and you and you
he indicates george diego and jack stevens
there is no negotiation
three million dollars
that is all
i want two
gee jack a million each had such a nice ring to it
im doing all the work
taking all the risk and its my plane
diego and george look at each other
hey you guys dont have to do shit
just sit back and collect your money
you good with this
this is too much for inez to handle
she starts screaming machine gun spanish
something about a lousy two hundred and fifty thousand dollars and how diego is such a coward to give away all his money
diego is embarrassed but tries to remain calm
you will watch what you say
especially around george
he is my brother and he speaks as good spanish as you
but inez is wild
she starts in again a log of putos sobs and cojones and maricones gay sissys
even cesar is uncomfortable
get your hands off me
inez takes a swing at diego and catches him full across the face
time stops in the room
what will diego do
diego swings back and a full scale is on
cesar continues the conversation
as if diego and inez werent beating the shit out of each other right in front of them
do you have pictures of your kids
ill need to see them
also need their names and the names of their schools
we are trusting you with ninety million dollars worth of coca mr
without your children there is no deal
stevens thinks about it
kids as collateral
inez and diego are still duking it out
but diego finally gets the upper hand and drags her into the bedroom
so if thats all ill be leaving now
cesar walks him to the door
dont forget the pictures
diego calls from the other room
george come in here
diego has put inez in the bathroom and is holding the door closed
she pounds and kicks and screams in frustration but he pays no attention
whats the matter george
whats the matter
were moving three hundred fucking kilos and were making dogshit
a million dollars for our first run is not bad george
it is bad
its chump change
we might as well be hauling suitcases across the border
were getting screwed
and what happens when these guys stop paying
sooner or later these guys are going to cut us out
then where are we
thats my george always thinking
the door is yanked open to reveal inez
she is in a rage
diego slams it in her face
this is only part of the business george
a very small part
dont worry there is so much more to do
which reminds me i need a favor from you
i must go to colombia
what is it george
because i have to get home
ive got a parole officer waiting for me
i need you to go to miami
george gets out of a taxi to find several colombian men hanging around outside an apartment
he checks the address and moves over to the men
friend of diegos
the colombian men are not impressed
they grab george and pull him inside
george is pinned against the wall and the colombian men all start screaming at him in spanish
there seems to be a problem
a man alessandro steps forward
he is the one who speaks english
i dont know
he sent me
oh i see
well that explains everything
open your mouth george
georges puzzled look is replaced by a gun barrel in his face
alessandro presses it against georges front teeth
now you listen to me
are you hearing me
you see this
he indicates two duffel bags stuffed with fifty kilos of cocaine
ive been holding this shit for him for three weeks
you tell diego i dont appreciate it
you tell him i want my money by friday
can you do that
george sits on his bed reading
two duffel bags are tucked away in the closet
ermine pokes her head in
you have a phone call
george picks up the phone
jesus christ diego where are you
its been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money
bad news george
im in colombia
well you better get here fast
im sitting on
george notices ermine is loitering in the hallway eavesdropping
george acknowledges her before shutting the door in her face
im sitting on fifty fucking keys
get your ass up here
its a south american prison
diego is on the pay phone
its a little hard to get away right now
im afraid youre on your own
george and derek sit in the living room with mr
t a hippie ish looking professor
on the table sits various paraphernalia
scales beakers test tubes and a hot box
george and derek watch as mr
t scoops some of georges cocaine and sets it onto the two inch metal plate
what were doing is measuring the purity
pure coke melts out a hundred and eighty five a hundred and ninety degrees
cutting agents melt much lower
about a hundred degrees
quality product starts melting at a hundred and forty degrees
thats what im hoping for
t turns the dial
holy fucking mary
jesus fuck me running
where did you get this shit
at one hundred and eighty seven degrees the white powder dribbles off the hotplate and melts away
can i do a fucking line
t puts his nose in the powder
george pulls foreal aside
what did i tell you
its great and everything but what am i going to do with all this
jesus christ george i dont see you in two years and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine
just sell it derek
alright but its gonna take me a year
all over the floor the counters the chairs and even in the sinks
george and derek count the money patiently writing the dollar amount in yellow high lighter on the top of each stack before wrapping it with a rubber band
thirty six hours
i cant believe it
everything is gone in thirty six hours
i think its fair to say you underestimated the market there derek
but to the victor belong the spoils
george divides the money
theres a hell of a lot
half a million for you
half a million for me
one point three five for the colombians
nice doing business with you george
not bad for a weekends work huh
immaculate in his white turtleneck and sunglasses george walks with two aluminum cases
he is greeted by alessandro and his thugs
where do you guys want to count
on the plane
we going someplace
where we headed
you have your money
its all there
what the fuck is going on
they usher him away
the lear jet lands
the blazer pulls into a long driveway
they approach a gate where shirtless teenagers with mac s stand guard
the gate opens
young soldiers open the door for george and roughly usher him over to a jeep within the confine
they frisk him top to bottom
diego is leaning against another jeep and waits for george to be released
george good to see you my brother
what the fuck is going on
when did you get out of jail
pablo used his influence
now george watch what you say
everybody hears everything
a lot of things get said and done that well lets just say this isnt america
life is cheap here you know
no offense but you know what im saying
keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking
now who is the person in california
just a friend
i need to know
ah never mind
well talk about it later
you do the talking
the sound of a young man a maleton struggling can be heard in the distance
from another area pablo escobar emerges
he is singular in purpose
he is handed a pistol and moves quickly over to the man and quietly speaks a few words
and then without emotion he shoots the maleton in the head
george and diego who is visibly shaken watch
escobar is handed a towel and he wipes the splattered blood off his hands as he moves back
he will see you now
to diego not you
there must be some kind of mistake
escobar will see mr
you are to wait here
its alright george
this way please
the large colombian man escorts george towards the area where the maleton was just shot
george looks back at diego as he is led away
so this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day
actually it was three
the man who gives us the airplanes
the man from america
you are going to open for us the gates of hollywood george
it would be my pleasure
welcome my friend
welcome to my country
escobar moves over to embrace george
george returns it and their hands come together
george cant help it
he reflexively looks at his hands
the man in the garden
he was full of courage
un rata no good
but he could have run fled the country
gone to the policia
but then his wife his children his parents his friends many people would die
but never mind
i am thinking we can do much together
this problem with diego the stolen car the jail is very silly business
to release him from the carcel it causes me much inconvenience
the fifty kilos could have been a big problem
and i dont like problems
with all respect padrino
diego is my partner
i do not do business without him
escobar looks at him with a cold stare
but george doesnt flinch
his face reveals nothing
finally a smile breaks across pablos lips
i like you george
you are loyal
that is good
that is rare
i can tell already
you are like me
i look at you and i see myself
its in the eyes no george
yes it is
so you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country george
as much as you can give me
as much as i can give you
i like that
let us drive
we have much to talk about
diego watches the two men walk outside
escobar throws an arm around georges shoulder
pablo hops into a jeep and motions for george
the bodyguards come running
but pablo waves them away
escobar pulls the jeep off the road and parks it
before them is a stunning panorama
i like to come up here
to make the decisions
to be one with nature
people tell me that i am crazy
that my business will never work in your country
what do you think george
escobar looks out over the vista allowing george the time to respond in full
what do i think
i dont want my answer to be influenced by what i want so im going to have to say i dont know
i do not know either
what do you want george
i want money
which is what george
keep them coming
keep them coming
you are right
diego is my brother
escobar looks at george a long time
take care of him george
im fond of him but he is sometimes like a baby
keep an eye on him okay
diego is a little pissed off for being left for so long
he taps his foot and picks at his fingernails
escobar and george pull up in the jeep
diego leaps to his feet
escobar wraps his arms around diego in an embrace
ive made a decision
we are going into business and i would like to start right away
the following images are overlaid with snow falling and money dropping through frame
close shots of george and diego on the phone wheeling and dealing hands counting cash and lines being drawn off mirrors
the effect is surreal and dreamy
a duffel bag is unzipped revealing bricks and bricks of cocaine
each marked with a p
a knife punctures one of the bricks
a mound of white powder is brought up to a mans nose
its george who samples and then it is sampled by the man he is doing business with
the shot widens to reveal all the participants and dozens and dozens of duffel bags
a handshake seals the deal
handshake after handshake after handshake
george and diego counting cash
all over the floor in two foot stacks
various transactions completed
george and diego count
its ridiculous how much money there is
the stacks are now waist high and spill into other rooms
inez is there pacing the floor and rapid fire talking on the phone
george and diego the banditos
arms around each other in camaraderie
in diegos yellow ferrari
with inez sunning on a yacht
more coke and more transactions
when the deals are with derek foreal diego is always notably absent
the money is so high it almost reaches the ceiling
there is nowhere to put it
george and diego sit at the coffee table dwarfed by the stacks of bills
there is a discrepancy in the count
i counted it twice
its two point five george
i am sure
george starts to pick up the money
im calling it three
were half a million off
im not counting it again
if its sixty pounds its three
if its fifty its two point five
i dont give a shit
george moves down the hall looking for a place to stack the money but there is no more room
where do i put this
try the back bedroom
george opens the back bedroom door to find wall to wall money
theres no room
try the closet
no luck there either
george drops the money on the floor and moves back into the living room
weve got to do something about this
george and diego watch as their money is hauled into a huge wall safe
armed panamanian soldiers stand guard
the panamanian officials and the bank president oversee the proceedings
are you comfortable with this
george weve got sixty one million dollars
its either here or someplace else
weve got to put it somewhere
unless you want to launder it
and keep only forty percent
its a federal bank
guaranteed by the government
and senor noriega has very lenient banking principles
all the pesados keep their money here
even el padrino
what do you worry
everyone knows we are with escobar
who is going to fuck with us
george and diego sign papers
the bank president congratulates them and hands them documentation
i love it
i give you thirty million dollars and you give me this little book
diego and inezs wedding
the lineup with all of the bridesmaids
george is the best man and the only american
a huge reception
all the pomp and circumstance colombian money can buy
and every smuggler north of colombia
george sits with diego and inez at the table of honor
inez is opening presents
diegos tipsiness is a little out of character but hey its his wedding day and a little champagne never hurt anyone
he drunkenly throws his arm around georges shoulder
im married george
i cant believe it
can you believe im married george
youre a lucky man diego
i love you my brother do you know that
i love you too man
george notices mirtha showing teeth across the room
ill be right back diego

george walks across the dance floor directly towards mirtha

i dont think so
why are you smiling
why are you smiling
i dont know

jung i see youve met my fiancee mirtha

george looks back mirtha is giving him more teeth
george arrives at the table
pleased to meet you finally george

my pleasure augusto
diego has told me much about you
congratulations on your conquest of the west coast
how much bigger can we get
skys the limit

if its accepted by actors and musicians the rest will follow
they all agree
mirtha still gives george the teeth from across the room
diego returns to the table
we are talking about georges west coast operation
ah georges mystery man
yes where is this man
when do we meet him
you dont meet him
george keeps this a secret
hes here meeting everyone goes to colombia and meets pablo but still keeps his secrets
even from his brother
come on george were all in this together
yes george theres enough for everybody
i think padroni is happy with the current situation
will you please excuse me
george exits after mirtha
george steps into the empty lobby looking for mirtha
he cant find her
she appears from the shadows and startles him
george embraces her and plants one on her
you better know what youre doing george
youre playing with fire
i like fire
close up george does a huge line left to right
close up mirtha does a huge line right to left
a stretch limo flies by left to right
the windows are open and mirtha and george whoop it up as they go by
george and mirtha out on the crowded dance floor grooving to the salsa rhythms
champagne bottles in hand george and mirtha on the tarmac running from the limo to the waiting private plane
george and mirtha poolside wearing shades getting some sun
she blows him a kiss from the adjoining lounge chair
he blows one back
she licks her lips and its on
hes out of the chair pouring champagne over her tan body and licking it off
she squeals with delight
a table gets knocked over as they cause a commotion
a hotel manager comes over but george hands him a wad of cash and he quickly fucks off
the dancing is in super slow motion now
passionate carnal intimate
george buys gifts for mirtha and she shows them off for the camera
overhead shot of george and mirthas bedroom
its completely covered with money
george and mirtha make love on the sea of cash
as camera pulls up we see money slowly falling from the ceiling
there is no white dress
there is no tuxedo
george and mirtha havent even taken off their sunglasses
mirtha wipes her red nose
i need a fucking drink
george moves to the bedroom
mirtha is pregnant and shes showing
shes also bent over a mirror with a straw in her hand
george opens the door and takes her by surprise
oh dont be such a fucking hypocrite
i quit smoking didnt i
put that shit away theyre here
mirtha and george lead fred and ermine from room to room showing off the house
the decor is well eclectic
it doesnt match the architecture
its all so beautiful
what do you think dad
look at this credenza
if you dont mind me asking how much is something like that
its got to cost a fortune
quickly its a family heirloom
ive seen those in magazines
theyre not cheap
mirtha comes from a very wealthy family
oh i see
ill show you the rest of the house
george and his father move outside
george and his father walk
so business is going good
ive got this import export thing going on in miami thats been very profitable
with my investments
dont bullshit me george
i dont see you very much i dont want to waste the time
they move along the rear of the house
classic cars line the driveway
you come from my body remember
youre my baby boy
the same kid who would jump off a mountain if someone told him he couldnt do it
you havent changed much
i know the things you do
but i get the picture and i dont care
i dont like it
its not what i would have chosen for you but its your life
it doesnt have anything to do with me
he turns and looks at his boy
youre like your mother
you love money
no its good
you have a family
its good if it makes you happy
its nice to have nice things
are you happy son
im happy right now
diego puts a straw in his nose and snorts a big gakker
his eyes are wide his pupils dilated and a weapon sticks out of the back of his pants
he knocks the dust off his nose before moving outside
george is on the porch smoking a cigarette
how long have we been in business
does she get to meet your connection
was she good enough
shut up diego
theyre going to be here any minute
im trying to concentrate
im very angry with you george
you dont take me to california but you take your bitch wife
i understand you love her but it was you and me who started this
you and me
what do you need my connection for diego
what are you going to do with it
what do i do with it
its for peace of mind
its for the principle
george doesnt have time for this
he checks the cylinders on his weapon and runs over possible scenarios in his mind
but diego wont get off the soap box
jesus fucking christ diego
i aint telling you
its just business
now shut up
youre driving me crazy
im driving you crazy
youre driving me crazy
we had a dream
what happened to our dream
a black sedan pulls up and five puerto rican men approach the room
george and diego greet them and lead them inside
its game time
the atmosphere is charged with danger and everyone is acutely aware of everything
the guys sit down their guns bulging through the inside of their suits
the suitcases are opened
the rules are the same
no raising voices
no sudden movements
george offers their leader tony beers for his men and is politely declined
the count starts
george and diego riff through ten thousand dollar bundles
diego is still acting pissy
hes mumbling to himself making faces slamming the money all around
the guys keep a close eye on him
diego finishes a stack throws one of the bags on the ground
the conversation is in spanish unless otherwise indicated
no no no
no problema amigo
el dinero esta todo aqui
lleves las llaves y mas tarde lo contaremos
the pressure is getting to one of the hoods
his name is benny
hes got a crazy eye and he seems ready to snap
george resumes the count but diego wont get off it
english you embarrassed me george
you make me look very bad
que esta diciendo
todo esta bien
english everything is not alright
i bring you in and you slap my fucking face
this is not the time diego
the men all reach for their pieces and all hell starts to break loose

i didnt fuck you
maldita sea que diablos esta diciendo

the guns are out and pointed

george steps forward with the keys
take the fucking keys
courtesy of benny george is hit
the shoulder the collarbone
its hard to tell
estoy bien okay
everything is alright
theres no problem
this never happened
no one has to know anything about this
diego i want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is

es un ford blanco junto a una pick up
tony very carefully takes the car keys
no problem gentlemen
the men slowly back out the door
george looks at diego
derek fucking foreal
the answer to all your dreams
are you happy now
george and diego exit the terminal
georges arm is in a sling
the familiar sight of derek foreal is lincoln continental
the three men come together and diego and derek are introduced
the mens hands come together and the frame freezes on their handshake
fred pulls into the driveway in his new car and honks the horn
fred and ermine get out of the car
its a new years eve party
a lavish colombian celebration
george and a very pregnant mirtha move through the crowd to find augusto
im so glad you two could make it
mirtha look at you
you look like youre about to burst
i dont know
try the bar
and if you find her tell her to come its almost midnight
as mirtha leaves augusto throws his arm around georges shoulder
its good you came down george
we need to discuss a few things
hes not here george
yeah well where is he
and who is this norman k
thats all anyone is talking about
do i know him
augusto lets out a big laugh
norman cay is not a person
he is an island george
in the bahamas
from what they say it is free and its diegos new home
augusto throws an arm around georges shoulder
let us walk
from what i understand diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres a marina a hotel and an airstrip
motherfucker works fast
the word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire
he is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump off point
jack stevens is already a very busy man
along with many others
you shouldnt stay away so long
we cant be up and running
augusto says nothing
but the ball is dropping in times square
happy new year
streamers confetti and champagne
george marches through the kissing guests and over to a phone
the music is up so he has to scream
this is george
am i wearing lipstick
i said am i wearing lipstick
because when im getting fucked i want to make sure my face is pretty
youre buying directly from diego arent you you son of a bitch
derek foreal in full new years regalia complete with party hat
i dont want to get caught in the middle of this
thats between you and diego
georges face scrinches in pain
its nothing personal george
the song ends and george is left standing there screaming
i bring you in and this is how you repay me
you little homo
the family is all there
fifteen twenty strong
cuban coffees all around

blanca reaches into her purse pulls out an ice pick folded in a piece of linen cloth and puts it down in front of george

george cruises through the turqoise water of the caribbean in a sport fisherman
before him is norman cay
white sand beaches
waiting for him is cesar
good to see you george
its been a long time
the yacht club is a tavern style bar that juts out over the water
the crimson sky streaks the windows
diego looks like che guavera
his hair is long and a graying beard sticks through his gaunt face
the bar has been taken over by diegos banditos
automatic weapons and prostitutes accent this drunken setting
george is escorted through the door by cesar and the room quiets
all eyes on diego and george
george i am happy to see you
how are you my brother
no more brothers diego
of course we are brothers
why do you say that
you hurt me george
you fucked me diego
i did not
you went behind my back and you cut me out
no i never
i would not do that george
i talked to foreal diego
there is a pause
diegos goons ready their weapons as diego scoops up a cringer with his pinky and sniffs
maybe you are right
i did betray you a little bit
one of the men says something in spanish and everyone laughs
george is furious
he starts to tremble and his face turns red
oh boo hoo boo hoo
so sad george
i stole your california connection
who introduced you to pablo escobar
who introduced you to your fucking colombian wife
who protected you when my friend cesar roza wanted to slice your fucking throat huh
who mad you millions and millions of dollars
and what do i get in return
i have always given you everything george but that is over now
this is my operation
so go home george
go back to your stupid little life
you can sell half grams to your fucking relatives for all i care
because you are out
george lunges at diego and is immediately grabbed
youd better kill me now diego because youre a dead man
george dont be so emotional
this is business
besides i cant kill you you are my brother
they lead him away
george is getting the shit kicked out of him
his teeth broken kicked in the head the body the groin
his arm stomped
blood and broken bones
its a king size beating
the men prop him up and cesar reaches back and hits him with a haymaker
georges nose is broken
blood spurts everywhere
george is dropped to the ground spit on and left for dead
say hi to your pretty wife for me
a beautiful sprawling estate
a family barbecue colombian style is in full swing
kids play soccer
zoo animals run wild together
george is led outside by two over armed bodyguards
pablo sees him and gives george a big hug
george you look terrible
well drink some scotch
i didnt come here to drink scotch
im sorry about this george
im not happy about this situation
you now know who your brutus is
you know why im here

i came here for permission
out of respect pablo
this is bullshit hes making me look like a punk
it is very difficult
diego makes me a lot of money
if diego goes so does the money
you were an excellent teacher george
when the student has learned well the teacher is no longer necessary
we must remember we have wives friends familia
even familia that has not been born
but sometimes we must forget as well
i am like you

we started this george
escobar embraces george for a moment and then george starts to move away
it is best served cold
mirtha is sleeping
shes so big she looks like shes gonna explode
george sits on the bed and rests his hand on mirthas face
he looks like the elephant man
oh jesus christ george
look at you
shhh honey never mind
i quit the business
pablo said no
pablo said no
its all over
and im never going back
i have you
we have the baby
and theres nothing else
its just the family now
fred ermine and mirth are waiting for george in the car
mirthas water has broken
ermine honks the horn from the back seat and screams out the window
george its time
george is high and in a panic
he races around trying to get a suitcase packed and find his keys
he finally gets it together but before he runs out the door he does one last blast
mirtha is on the birthing table and screaming in pain
george wears hospital scrubs and a surgical mask
he and his saucer pupils hold mirthas hand in comfort
the baby comes and doctor mick bay slaps its behind and cuts the cord
tough ass mirtha breaks down and sobs hysterically
but something is wrong with george
the color drains from his face
he grabs his chest and falls over onto the floor
the medical staff attends to him
watching my baby girl born did something to me
they talk about religious experiences i didnt believe in religion
but when kristina sunshine jung came into this world something in me changed
i looked at her and i knew right then that i could never love anything but my daughter ever again
it sounds sappy but it was like click i knew what i was put on this planet for
it was the greatest feeling i ever had followed by the worst feeling i ever had
the doctor grabs georges wrist
hes in tachycardia
george your heart is racing
have you been using drugs
i dont know
maybe eighteen grams
in how long
oh jesus get me a lead e
and start an i
this man is having a heart attack
george lies in the recovery room sedated tubes everywhere
hes hooked up to ivs monitors and machines
ive reviewed your toxicology report three times george
ive never seen anything like it
the lethal dose is a gram and a half
you should be in the guiness book
george cracks a faint smile
its not funny george
you should be dead right now
i cannot come up with one logical explanation for why youre still breathing
im not here to give you lectures ive got no moral interest in what you do
but take it easy george
stay with us a while
youve got a daughter now
kristina is crying
daddy george to the rescue
he picks her up cuddles her
gives her a bottle and she quiets
a one year old kristina is being coaxed by george to take her first steps
come on honey
you can do it
come to daddy
kristina tries stumbles
gets up again
she looks like a drunk but shes doing it
shes all pinned out dressed in ungaro cartier and dark sunglasses
she did that before
these are her first steps
she did that before
but this is
i said ive seen it before
can you lift the furnace
i need money
where are you going
the years go by and they are superimposed as they pass
george clean and sober enjoying family life
healthy and happy
mirtha looks worse and worse as her habit becomes bigger and bigger
as george and kristina grow closer and closer mirtha is stepping out on the town
blowing money right and left
shopping with mirtha buying clothes furs and diamonds
as kristina gets older we see her birthday parties
george and kristina wearing paper hats and eating ice cream
shes two years old shes three four five six
the eastham house is all done up for a party deluxe
fully catered with bartenders waiters music the works
and of course the three cs champagne caviar and colombians
george is laughing with augusto and martha oliveros but when derek foreal appears in the doorway george excuses himself and walks over
happy birthday george
mirtha invited me
she told me
look im sorry about everything
i feel like an idiot
you were right
i did fuck you
and then diego fucked me

i lost sight of everything

its in the past
im out of the business now so forget about it
no hard feelings
we need to move on
and besides im sorry too
for calling you a homo
that was out of line
george throws his arm around dereks shoulder
good to see you derek
mirtha runs in with a giant crystal punch bowl filled with mother of pearl
she holds it over her head triumphantly
now lets fucking party motherfuckers
lets have some fucking fun
jesus is that mirtha
a very underweight mirtha nervously runs around the party shoving coke up everyones noses
she is gakked to the gills and out of control
her pupils a mile wide
christ almighty george
feed her a cheeseburger or something
what does she weight eighty pounds
she needs to slow down
shes going to blow an o ring
the birthday cake is brought in the candles are blown out and everyone cheers
mirtha runs over to her husband still holding the cocaine
shes sweaty her hair matted down on one side

she tries to push a line up his nose
no thats alright

everyone raises their glasses
a party guest comes running inside
theyre all over the place
the waiters in their white jackets exchange knowing looks
the bartender comes out from behind the bar
in an instant all of the waiters guns are out
massachusetts state police department
everybody on the floor
police cars everywhere
all the party guests are filed out the door and are being led away
mirtha is dragged out spitting and screaming
george in handcuffs is pushed to a squad car
he looks through the window to see a female police officer escorting kristina out of the house
george still dressed in his party clothes sits at a desk
two detectives set a confession in front of him
its your statement
how it was all yours the pound of coke was for personal use and none of the guests had any idea it was there yeah right
george looks through the papers
i want my kid out of protective custody

the detectives ponder
detective walks to the door

its the middle of the night
george walks through a dark and lonely house
he goes to the furnace opens it up and sees that there are only five stacks left
george pulls up to the front
ermine your son is here
tell him i dont want to see him
tell him hes not welcome here
ermines back is to george
she wont look at him

she disappears into the house
the sound of a door slamming
its all over the news

they stand there and look at each other for a while
theres a lot to say but nothings coming out
george hands fred a gym bag

the two men throw their arms around each other and hold on to one another in the doorway of the old house

george breaks away and moves to the t bird
take care of yourself
george walks through the bank
george sits at a desk in front of a panamanian bank employee
he slides his bank book across the table
id like to make a withdrawal
the employee opens the book and gets a funny look on his face
excuse me please
he gets up and moves to the bank manager
they move to another manager type
and then everyone disappears behind closed doors
finally the bank president emerges and moves over to george
im afraid there is a problem mr
the banks have gone through a change a nationalization
im afraid your funds have been appropriated by the panamanian government
george starts to shake
the bank president tries to explain but whatever he says is unimportant
george is paralyzed
an inexpensive one bedroom furnished apartment
it aint much but its home
mirtha has just received the news and is losing her mind
clara blanca is cooking dinner

mirtha grabs nuts

george tries to fend her off
the car swerves all over the road
its turned into a full scale fist fight
the red lights of floridas finest come up behind them and george is pulled over
mirtha leaps out of the car teary eyed crazed and bloodied
the policemen step from their car
hes a fugitive and a fucking cocaine dealer

george sits behind the wheel
he knows its over

mirtha is sitting at the glass

she moves away and drags nine year old kristina into the room
kristina yanks her arm away and they get into a heated argument
through the glass george cant hear the words but its clear that kristina doesnt want to be here
shes so big
mirtha forces kristina over to the glass and keeps showing her prompting her to talk
kristina stares at george through the glass
she picks up the phone and speaks every word an accusation
i thought you couldnt live without your heart
she drops the phone walks away and doesnt look back
george puts in the quarters

george ben and g
wait on the tarmac
george is pacing
the sound of a cessna is heard and soon it is dropping out of the sky
the plane lands and taxis over
kevin and leon stick their fists out of the airplane in triumph
the men quickly unload the plane into the trunks of two broncos and the back of a truck
we follow the duffel bags out of the bronco into the house
the boys sit around as george samples the product

the camera slowly pans back to the guys

leon looks at g
i feel bad

ive known him for thirty fucking years
yeah i like him too

the camera pans back slowly to the bathroom door george comes back into the room dancing
he goes and sits down with the guys
laughing dulli i was just thinking about that time we landed in mexico
youve gotten a lot better since then huh pal
remember that fucking landing strip
george is the only one smiling
no one is looking at him
hey whats wrong fellas
why the long faces
he looks at each one
he slowly realizes somethings up
he looks to dulli finally
the front door busts down agents pour in
the camera swish pans to george
slow dolly into george has tears in his eyes
he is frozen
paralyzed by the memories
the voices from the bust can be heard as the camera pushes slowly into georges face
i was busted
set up by the fbi and the dea
that didnt bother me
set up by kevin dulli and derek foreal to save their own asses
that didnt bother me
sentenced to sixty years at otisville
that didnt bother me
nine year old kristina sunshine jung sits on the front porch as the sun goes down
her bags are packed and ready to go
i had broken a promise
everything i loved in my life goes away
george is led into a small room and greeted by his lawyer heres the deal george
youre not getting out
i tried to get you furloughed but your mother squashed it
said it would only upset him
george takes it in
the years have not been kind
hows he doing
well hes out of the hospital but theres not much anyone can do for him
its just a matter of time
listen i brought a tape recorder in case you wanted to say something to him
that way he could hear your voice
zigmond sets the tape recorder down and leaves the room
george stares long at the machine
he pushes the record button and looks at the red light
a sixty nine year old fred shuffles from his house to the blue ltd
he gets in turns the key and puts his sons tape into the deck
you know i remember a lifetime ago i was about three and a half feet tall weighing all of sixty pounds every inch your son
six year old george runs through the leaves to the truck and rides to work with his father
those saturday mornings going to work with my dad
wed climb into that big yellow truck
i used to think it was the biggest truck in the world
i remember how important the job we did was
how if it werent for us people would freeze to death
i thought you were the strongest man in the world
ermine as loretta young
fred jung and his son tossing a baseball
tuna and george driving off in the black oldsmobile convertible
the fbi arresting george in his old bedroom
remember those home movies when mom would dress up like loretta young
and the ice creams and the football games
waino the tuna and the day i left for california only to come home with the fbi chasing me
trout pulls a handcuffed georges boots over his socks as fred and ermine watch
and that fbi agent trout
when he had to get on his knees to put my boots on
thats where you belong
a choked up fred repeats the words
putting on georges boots
that was a good one dad
that was really something
georges eyes well up and he sparks a cigarette as he keeps trying to tell his father goodbye
and that time you told me that money wasnt real
well old man im forty two years old
i finally learned what you tried to tell me so many years ago
tears come crashing out of the old mans stoic face
i finally understand
youre the best dad
i just wish i could have done more for you
i wish we had more time
a vision of fred jung sits on the ground before his fifty two year old son
i guess i kind of lost sight of things
may the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars
that was a beautiful message
i meant every word of it
did you know i died two weeks after you sent me that tape
the apparition of fred disappears and george is left alone once again
i knew that
george is led into the room where three fbi men await him
one of them is named fred garcia
how are you doing george
what do you guys want
you hear about your old friend diego
what about him
garcia tosses a newspaper onto the table
the miami herald
inside is a full page letter addressed from diego delgado to vice president george bush
in the letter diego offers to make a deal
in exchange for immunity diego will rat out the entire cocaine business
americans colombians noriega escobar everybody
just let him free
what the fuck

george sits in the chair behind the plexiglass
mirtha enters and takes a seat on the other side
mirtha whats going on

george kristina hates you
you fucked her over one too many times
and im not here to socialize

he said this thing with diego is a disaster
hes giving up lab locations names bank accounts he was very pissed off
pablo said to take him down
his exact words were fuck diego
he wants me to testify
is that what hes asking me to do
george he wasnt asking
mirtha gets up and starts to move away
mirtha how are you doing
better than you
george archie zigmond and two armed guards walk down the corridor
hey arch you think the judge will let us get a cocktail after this is all over
ill see what i can do george
they walk into the crowded courtroom
standing room only
the courtroom buzzes as george is led down the center aisle and is handed off to the bailiff
over this we hear
sir please state your name
im george jung
spelled j u n g
jung do you know diego delgado
yes i do
do you see him here in the courtroom
yes hes sitting right there at the end of the table
let the record state the witness has identified diego delgado
the following sound bytes are dissolved together in montage style
jung can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with mr
shortly after i arrived at danbury federal correctional institute i related to diego that the crime i was in for was smuggling marijuana
diego told me he had high level connections in colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into america
the first run was fifteen kilos which we smuggled into logan airport in hard shelled suitcases
we wrapped the cocaine in kitchen cabinet paper and duct tape that way if there were any dogs in customs
i introduced diego to a pilot named jack stevens who helped us fly kilos of cocaine per week into the united states via twin engine cessnas
jack would fly into north carolina wed meet him there and drive it down to different distribution points
i never met pablo escobar
diego delgado was my only connection to cocaine from colombia
diego convinced me to keep most of my money in a panamanian bank
diego had a close relationship with manuel noriega
in exchange for allowing us to keep our money there we paid him a percentage
there was an chance that if you snorted cocaine between it was ours
initially with my la connections we invented the marketplace
in there was no other real competition
the first year we made about million dollars between us
it was an expensive operation
eventually we built up to three different pilots doing multiple runs per week connections on both coasts everything was running smooth
we were like a corporation
he was very anti government
he talked about revolution forming his own country or island he was looking for power as well as money
i was just looking for money
he disliked the united states thought it was a police state
he hoped that by flooding the country with cocaine it would disrupt the political system and tear down the morality of the country
well yes derek foreal was my connection i met him back in when i first moved to manhattan beach
it was foreals marijuana connections that kicked off our cocaine market
yes it was my idea to bring the kilos to los angeles
when diego finally got derek foreals name from me it was only a matter of months before hed cut me out
im not sure how my relationship with my daughter and ex wife have anything to do with this trial
i mean were here to talk about diego delgado arent we
yes we are mr
we come out of the montage the defense attorney diego delgado joe calibanos a sleazy greek like ex basketball weight lifter guy is now doing the questioning
jung youre a convicted felon correct
yes i am
do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the united states government in regards to your testimony
no i cam here out of my own volition
something about vengance being best served cold
are you getting paid mr
jung dont you have an agreement or understanding with the united states government in connection with your testimony in this case
im doing sixty years at otisville no chance of parole
even if they cut my sentence in half ill be seventy three years old
thats some fucking deal
i dont know if the parole board the judge the pope or jesus christ himself can get me out of here
i have a really bad record im not sure whats going to happen
so you do have an agreement with the united states government mr
george cant respond
looks to diego
looks from the jury the judge george is on the spotlight and its uncomfortable
he feels suddenly sleazy
i thought so
no more questions
the judge tells george he can step down
calibanos laughs quietly with associates
george is bummed
he walks by diego
they look at each other
you shouldnt have taken the million diego i was out
george is lead away
the court calls mr
jack stevens is lead to the stand
we slowly dissolve to the green of the new york state countryside drifts by as a brown mazda moves along highway
behind the wheel is a beautiful year old woman wearing dark sunglasses
she drives absently her mind somewhere else
the woman is buzzed through the double doors
she moves to the man behind the desk and takes off her sunglasses
im here to see my father
kristina sunshine jung
the guards are rounding up the other prisoners and escorting them inside but george is still planting sunflowers
hey george five more minutes buddy
the admissions officer looks up from his paperwork
kristina grabs her papers and moves to the counter
belongings in here
kristina empties her pockets and deposits her possessions into a locker box
she is handed a key
feet on the blue line
kristina stands on a blue piece of tape and the admissions officer buzzes open the giant metal door
but kristina doesnt move
he presses the buzzer again but she just stands there
george turns around as a guard taps him on the shoulder
george come on
youve got a visitor
george looks up to find kristina being buzzed through the gate
she moves through the open area and onto the grass quickly
slow motion father and daughter come together at last in a long embrace
im sorry baby
im so sorry
its alright dad
i didnt mean to
i know dad
he hugs her hard
i fucked up
i love you
i love you so much
youve got to know that
youve got to know
i know dad
i love you too
after everything the only thing left out of my whole life is you
kristina looks at her father smiles and disappears
there was no kristina
the guard continues to tap
george come on
its getting dark
george looks up to find a prison guard
his name is gus and he helps george to his feet
but i have a visitor
not today george
time to go back
but i want to put her name on the list for tomorrow
because shes visiting me
well do that tomorrow okay
its lockdown time
the shadows grow long and gus leads george down a cement path that cuts through the grass
the huge structure of otisville looms dark against the sky and gus and george take the long walk back
standing outside the fences kristina smokes a cigarette as she watches her father being led away
after a few moments she turns around walks to her car and gets in
time to go home
and as the brown mazda pulls out of the driveway the taillights turn red growing smaller and smaller until they finally disappear
