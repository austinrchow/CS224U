russell irving rosenfeld not a small man gets dressed and meticulously constructs his combover
camera wraps around see his hands with rings adjust his dark velvet suit up to his face serious concentrated intense he is composing himself before a performance
irving is now dressed ready and walks down the hall to another room
irving composes himself looks into cramped surveillance closet there are fbi agents we only see their hands and arms he looks at monitors sees a black and white image of
another room on monitor mayor carmine polito swath of salt and pepper hair cream suit pinky ring rotary club pin along with carl elway preppie shady businessman
he exhales pressure turns as camera pans to sydney prosser who will also be known for some time as edith greensly stylish crafty smart
they stare at each other intensely they have a deep and emotional relationship
a door bangs open and in walks richie dimaso bronx born
he stands there

irving swipes it away violently the second it touches his face

that bothers you
you know a lot of shit bothers me too but i was trying to help you
if i wanted to bother you if i really wanted to fucking bother you this is what id do
richie takes his hand and destroys the combover irving spent so much time creating
irving just stands there hair ruined staring at richie

irving just stands there staring at richie hair all wild and messed up looking very angry
you bothered now
no answer alright dont make a thing of it
you shouldnt touch him
he doesnt like that
oh my god fix his hair
dont make a thing of it
it takes some time ok
edith walks over to irving who is still standing there in silence with his hair all over the place
she carefully starts helping him put it back together
big fucking deal
we got to get in the other room come on
the mayors in there
yes i know that
should we go to the beauty parlor
is that what we should do
richie walks over and opens up a briefcase thats sitting on the dresser
inside are stacks of cash
edith is still helping irving put his hair back together
hows it look
you look fine
richie slams the briefcase shut looking very nervous and intense
slow motion double doors push open and edith enters the
i thought he was going to be here
i do business face to face person to person
thats just who i am
richie reaches down and awkwardly slides the briefcase over to carmine unprompted
leave monitors pov and return back to whoa excuse me excuse me
ill handle that for the mayor
no its for the mayor
it would be a sign of disrespect to the sheik if the mayor didnt take it himself
its for you mayor
carmine looks angry and confused
he looks over to carl
what are you doing
what to carl carl what the fuck
what is this
no ill handle it
im gonna take care of everythings good
i got everything under control
to richie thats for me
i handle all that for mayor

irving looks over and says nothing
not surprised at all how badly this is all going
edith whispers to richie
whispers to richie just stop it ok whispers to edith hes gotta take it himself okay
i dont know what the fuck that is but its weird you understand
i came here to meet a sheik thats all i know
im very interested in that but hes not here apparently
carmine turns and starts to walk out of the room
im very interested in meeting the sheik
you let me know when that could happen
thank you have a good day
carmine leaves the room
irving looks over and shrugs his shoulders
not surprised at all the way this is going and horrified that richie has ruined it
you better come get him
stares at irv go out there and get him right now
help me get him back
go get him
he needs to take the fuckin briefcase irving
i didnt wanna do it in the first place
this is your show you go get him
no you have no choice
you have to go get him
now go get him so he takes the briefcase by himself
thats the whole plan irving
irving stands up angry and gets in richies face
what were you doing pushing the fucking briefcase dummy
the whole fuckin thing was falling apart
you know how much i paid for this goddamn hotel that you fucking asked for
now i gotta go mop up your mess
im gonna go fucking mop up your mess
irving storms out of the hotel suite towards the elevators to get carmine
irving paces back and forth as he waits for the elevator
we push in on the concerned face of sydney as richie rambles on to her
you understand what im saying right
it wasnt working
irving continues to pace back and forth in the hall waiting for the elevator
did you ever have to find a way to survive and you knew your choices were bad
irving walks over and hits the elevator button again
i learned how to survive when i was a kid
my father had a glass business
drumming up business for his father
young irving and his father and mother standing outside the familys glass repair shop in the bronx as some tough contractors march up to them
i would rather be on the taking side than the getting taken side any day of the week especially after i saw how my father got taken
i mean seeing that scarred me for life
young irving runs by a store front as he throws a rock through each window on the store smashing them all
i took it upon myself to drum up business
i became a different kind of guy than my father
i became a con artist from the feet up for real
irv shakes his head surveys the damage
i was gonna survive no matter what
i still had the glass business and a few dry cleaning stores on the side
irving paces around his office smoking a cigar and talking on the phone
what looks to be stolen art sits on the floor all around him
and i did some art dealing on the side
stolen or forged art
chicagos does anybody really know what time it is
jamming early s holiday party long island ladies in enclosed pool while inside steamed glass shiny bikini guys who look mobbed up pale out of shape gold chains in swim
trunks even more burt reynolds type guys slim hairy chains
so one january i go to my friends pool party in long island
irving sits holding court with some friends by the pool when he turns and sees sydney for the first time
push in on irving
he looks up they lock eyes across the party
irvings hand grabs her arm she turns taken aback is that duke ellington on your bracelet
she does have on a duke ellington charm bracelet
as a matter of fact it is
he died this year you know
i doubt anyone else here knows or cares about it
well i care
he saved my life many times
irving takes a good look at her impressed
impressed mine too
smiles warm jeeps blues
you wanna hear it
cut to portable record player plays start of jeeps blues as irving and sydney nod to it he watches her foot in her high wedge and her tanned leg rocking
as she sits on arm of sofa
who starts a song like that
they listen to the record edith checks irving out
he wasnt necessarily in good shape and he had this comb over that was rather elaborate
he had this air about him
and he had this confidence that drew me to him
he was who he was and he didnt care
like me she was a very particular person
like me she came from a place where her options were limited and she had been someone she didnt want to be in her past
it actually can feel kind of sexy sometimes
theres a boldness in it
but where would that boldness take me
i didnt know
but i was gonna find out
like me she learned to survive and reinvent herself
she knew she had to reinvent her life and her identity
and like me she envisioned a better elegant future for herself
like me she knew you had to have a vision
sydney looks at scrap of paper with info in her hand looks up at office building address enters
she came to new york
she envisioned it
and just like that she applied for a job at cosmopolitan magazine
clean bright colors huge blown up cosmo covers sydney innocent plain slacks and blouse hair back nervously awaits interview
she is called in nervously stands small crumpled scrap of paper in hand fixes her hair well youre obviously here for a reason
lets get to it
our cover story right now is on cunnilingus
what do you think about that
i like it
do you have any clerical skills
can you type
she was unlike anybody i ever knew
she was smart
she saw through people in situations
and she knew how to live with passion and style
she understood duke ellington
cut to edith watches a cosmo cover shoot i was broke fearless with nothing to lose irv and sydney dance slowly
and my dream more than anything was to become anyone else other than who i was
irv holds the door open for edith as she enters
i got two in the bronx and three in manhattan
to an employee hey byron
he had a chain of dry cleaning stores
he asked me to come in and upgrade my wardrobe he said a lot of nice things got left behind by people and forgotten over the years i mean you
wouldnt believe the shit that people leave behind here
people leave stuff here
they go out for the night they drink come here in the morning put their clothes in and then they forget
they got no idea where they left it
irving touches a hanging blue sequined dress
look at that
i dont know
is that nice or not
irving and sydney continue to walk through towards the back and enter a fur vault filled with elegant designer clothes
i mean some of its been here for years
theyre not picking it up
nobodys picking it up
sydney starts riffling through nice things hanging on the racks
you like that
i love it
you want it
sydney looks back at irving in shock
you look fantastic
oh my god
i can only dream about these dresses
i felt like we had a secret
just the two of us
you know like that thing where you want to just be with the one person the whole time
you feel like the two of you understand something that nobody else gets
i could just tell her everything about myself
and i never had anybody like that in my life before
i felt like finally i can truly be myself without being ashamed without being embarrassed
irvs dingy office day irv leads sydney into a small dingy manhattan office on an upper floor
what is this place
do you sell art here
this is my office
i know its your office but you have these other places
whats this for
why did you bring me here
this getting to be my main business my growing business
i help get loans for guys that cant get loans
im their last resort
youre their last resort
because interest rates are north of and heading to
thats right smarty pants
fucking jimmy carter
fucking nixon really
and the war and the deficit and all of that shit
i love you youre so smart
thanks kid but how do you get them the money
well you dont do you
these guys are lousy risks you know
i cant get them a loan but i get my fee
you take five thousand and you dont give them anything
these are bad guys you know
they got bad divorces gambling habits embezzling all that shit you know what i mean
everybody at the bottom crosses paths eventually in a pool of desperation and youre waiting for them
how about we
how bout it
sydney turns and begins walking out the door as irving chases her out
sydney im sorry that was too much
i went too far
i didnt want to upset you
she continues walking out without looking back and leaves
sydney please im sorry
i know it aint for everybody
the door slams in irvings face
irving shouts to the closed door ah god i love getting to know you
what i do that for
i fucked it up
i should never tell a woman the truth
shes so smart
you said it was nice knowing me
you said it was nice to meet me
british accent would you like to meet lady edith greensly
irving looks stunned as he slowly clasps her extended hand
british accent i have royal banking connections in london
id love to help you with your loan but of course i have to be very selective
that was fucking fantastic
did you like it
i liked it
i didnt think you were coming back
thank god you came back
i wasnt going anywhere
i fucking love you
you have me
one of sydneys nanny friends rebecca walk out of a business mans house pushing a stroller as the business man comes chasing after them
and so irving and i began our partnership in love and commerce
rebecca hold on
youre edith right
he told me to tell my friends i had in british accent london banking connections im jim
im her employer
listen she told me you can get me a line of credit
i know you have banking connections in london england
and after that
say no a lot until the guy is hooked
edith and rebecca start walking away as the businessman chases after them
becky tell her
ive never missed a check
walking away it was almost scary how easy it could be to take money from desperate people
edith extends her hand to greet another businessman
edith is dressed in a more sophisticated high end british fashion
lady edith greensly its so good to see you again
lady your ladyship thank you again
these are the roles that we were meant to play
another desperate businessman sits across from edith and irving
were very selective
you got a strong application
well talk about it
i dont take a deal that i cant close
youre not being aggressive enough in putting up your assets the man looks nervous have you ever been to queens
have you ever been to great neck
everybody knows my dealerships
a desperate man takes out a business check book and writes his check
five thousand gets me fifty right
five will get me thirty five
is that right
five grand gets me fifty
sydney and irving laugh and celebrate
i was doing so much more business with her
i mean it doubled then it tripled
sydney hair getting bigger goes over the books with a latino man who nods and watches her edith counts cash in the register recounts it explains how things can be
done better as dry cleaning worker nods
irv watches happy
and i never met anyone man or woman in business who was so careful and precise about everything
every stylistic detail
irving and edith discuss a piece of art theyre in the process of selling to a businessman
we kept selling art together too
its really a fabulous example of a genre painting which is really rare for the time
its a boy and his dog
non religious painting
before we go any further is this legit
lets just say its missing from spain and leave it at that
dont show any spanish friends
irving and sydney kiss passionately in front of the middle aged car dealer as he tries to hand them his check
i mean it just took off
we got an elegant manhattan office
we called it london associates for her accent
london associates to a pale wall as he and edith sip champagne from flutes and offer one to the worker who toasts with them
irv and edith kiss gently lovingly sincerely on the lips they walk into their classic looking staid private banking when i was around her i felt joy
thats what i felt
they dance down park avenue together
irv and edith dance through the lobby
as they dance among mostly older wealthy couples on the small dance floor of the elegant restaurant as a live jazz quartet plays ive got your number
camera circles them putting their foreheads together very happy
they sing to each other quietly as they dance close
irv and edith make passionate love we see in pieces he gets up she watches him dress and leave he drives over the triborough bridge
as as far as i could see people were always conning each other to get what they wanted
we even con ourselves
he drives through the suburb of ranch houses and driveways and pulls into his driveway of his split level ranch
irv gets out of his cadillac and walks to the front door of his house we talk ourselves into things
we sell ourselves things we maybe dont even need or want by dressing them up
we leave out the risk
we leave out the ugly truth
irv walks into the decorated ranch house frosted glass with bird designs glass tables walls black and brown lacquer everywhere
he walks into the house and looks at a picture his son did a drawing of the yankees playing baseball that is taped to the refrigerator
pay attention to that because were all conning ourselves in one way or another just to get through life
irv takes dannys picture from the fridge and tip toes with low sounds now of o
tv irv goes to a closed door with yankee stickers on it irv opens a bedroom door to reveal his year old son danny
he was married and he had a son
danny is on the bed picture books baseball cards spread all around him
irv stands holding the picture
danny looks over his shoulder
he had adopted her son
he was a really good dad and i respected him for that
it was a tough situation for everyone
irvs face lights up
this is a fantastic picture
what did you do today
that kid donovan is being mean to me
the big kid
i thought mommy picked you up so he couldnt bother you
she was late and then after we put out the fire mommy said stay in my room with my baseball cards
danny reaches across to irving and takes his glasses off his face and puts them on
did you know they make a lamp that has the sun in it
irv looks at him mommy got the lamp
she made her special drink and the lamp made a fire
irv looks concerned
irvs wife rosalyn sits up on the bed in a muumuu half her face is burned
i put out the fire
the fire is out
for the first time in my life i do the right thing
oh shut up i save a young single mother and her kid
i marry her
i adopt him you fell in love
dont forget we fell madly in love
yes i fell in love
my god i fell in love
but you know what
i thought you were mysterious like my mother until it turned out that mysterious just meant depressed hard to reach
i mean im dying here
and you need somebody whos gonna be quiet like you
youre young youre beautiful
you gotta find somebody else
you gotta go out and get some friends all right
dont sit inside i dont like going out
you know that i get anxiety when i have to meet people
you know how hard that is
yeah but you cant just stay in the house with the fucking sun lamp
and i cant i mean look i cant trust you with it anyway
that fire and everything
i cant trust to leave you with danny
i put the fire out irving
there is no fire
maybe if you were here more then there wouldnt have been a fire in the first place
oh what there wouldnt have been a fire if i was here
just stop with the whole fire thing
god it was a mistake
im sure a million people do that all the time
those sun lamps are dangerous
shouldnt even have them in the house really
i bet that happens all the time
this was nothing
were not happy
rosalyn just stares there for a moment at irving saying nothing
you know that i could take danny
you know that most of your work is illegal
and you know that if you tried to divorce me you know that im not saying that i would but im saying that i could
and im saying that that is why i dont like divorce irving
women do that in divorces
women get the children and then the fathers never see them
my mother never got divorced
my grandmother never got divorced
there are no divorces in my family
i am not getting a divorce
what are we doing here
we fight and we fuck and thats what we do
thats our thing
she was the piccaso of passive aggressive karate
she was better than any con artist id ever met including myself
and she had me like nobody had me
rosalyn sheds her muumuu to reveal a white leotard
irving come to mama
you might say she was my karma for how i took advantage of people
irving come here
get into bed
baby theres such good stuff here
i did not want to leave the kid behind
he was my son
she had me
i was her mark
we now see the mark a charismatic mercurial wild eyed businessman mort papierman in need of a loan
morts eyes go from her knees to her eyes his eyes meet sydneys he looks soulful open
she stares at him
irv notices uncomfortably
and every deal i take i close
however my fee is non refundable just like my time
filling out paper work i want to thank you very much irving for seeing me
sorry im so nervous
richie reaches for his top button to adjust it
am i not buttoned
edith stares at him and smiles
i just gotta say mr
rosenfeld that lady edith was very adamant that you were top notch and thats correct
i really need your help
ive got the audis for collateral and the two boats and i forgot to mention that i have a little piece of real estate in long island
no you didnt mention that
two lunches and you never mentioned that
oh i was gonna mention it and then the guy with the hat walked in
and i forgot totally
it was the second time we had lunch
you couldnt see his eyes
he had no eyes
it was like did he make it
laughing do they sell hats like that
where do they come from
actually i went to the store that i thought maybe he bought it there
i was gonna get you one you were going to get me one
like as a memento
irving decides to interject
its two lunches
whats the big deal
i was trying to get him to be more aggressive
on his loan that is
mort papierman richie dimaso you showed me a whole new side of the city id never seen before
mort papierman richie dimaso no thank you
you liked it
should i take you there
should i take you there twice
confidential to edith whats going on you like this guy
yes i like this guy
is that messing up your judgement
dont be stupid
no hes not messing with my judgment
hey play your part
you play your part
holds out cashiers check take it to your people in london
please take it to them
i got the cashiers check right here
i give you five and you give me fifty right back right
please dont reject me
give a guy a chance
the air uncomfortably awkwardly until almost in slow motion edith takes the check staring at mort
irv starts zurich
you got an office in zurich
i can call paris
if you could excuse me for one second
yeah take your time
do whatever you need to do
go ahead take your time
as edith opens a side door bang federal agent stock you got the wrong office youre gonna be embarrassed
i may not have you irving but i have her on fraud
impersonating another individual
what is that
you may be from england edith but youre not royal and you have no banking connections and thats a felony
how long is that
thats years i think
about the handcuffs hey
not so tight
i dont even know your real name
richie pulls out a badge and shoves it in irvings face
richie dimaso fbi
nice to meet you
richie looks at edith with concern and points at irving
you gotta get away from this guy
agents take boxes of files out of the office irv standing alone in center of room shell shocked
he wouldnt let me see her for three days
he even managed to delay a lawyer
dim cell lit only from small high barred window no lights on
edith looks like shes coming apart circles under her eyes a shadow of her confident self pale scared hair flat stringy unglamourous pacing rocking
she couldnt handle it
fluorescent lights come on in the cell edith squints
cell is unlocked by richie dimaso who enters with a cup and saucer of tea
he stands near her with the tea
to the other side of the two way mirror joe how come the fluorescents are on
can we kill that please
to syd jesus i put this lamp here for you cause i thought itd be better for you
theres a wire here
theyre scared because people hang themselves but i know youre too smart for that
wheres the table and chair
theres no bed here
its like a fucking asylum
joe is everybody off today
jesus christ its scary
maybe i wanted to scare you
i dont know
maybe it was my idea
maybe im a little off the beaten path you know
i dont know
you look dehydrated
here want to try some tea
oh yeah your lips are all chapped
re tea its herbal
richie bends down to edith who is sitting on the floor in the corner and hands her the cup and saucer
she lifts the cup but her hand is shaking almost violently as she raises the cup to her lips
i know you think look at me
i know you think irv loves you
i know you think you know him that he sees the world as a cold dark place and he cares about nobody but very few people on his short list
his son his father rosalyn and you
and you think youre at the top of that list
but what if youre not
what if youre not even on the list at all
hed be in here right now if he took the check
she thinks about this
hed be in here right now if he took the check
but no you did
god its its so clear to me
its so crazy its clear to me but its not clear to you
he uses you edith to protect himself
to protect his son and his wife in long island
he put a ring on her finger he adopted her son
they have huge house they have two cars
what does she do all day
ill tell you what she does she plays with her nails she watches t
and she spends your money the money that you make
edith stares at richie taking this in
i dont like that youre in jail while hes going free
i dont like any of that
i want to help you
all the razzle dazzle that he does its not good
its not real
its not real
who you are is who you are between you and god
you and your soul
thats what matters
thats what counts
thats what im about
and thats what i see in you
tell me you didnt feel it the first time we saw each other
am i crazy
i dont think so
im not supposed to be talking like this but i dont care i break the rules
edith looks at richie in silence as she thinks about what hes saying
i want to help you
i like you
whispers i like you
dead serious i like you
irv stands alone on the other side of the glass staring at sydney
richard dimaso walks in
been in there three days
hasnt been so good for her
irv continues to stare at sydney
how does that make you feel her in there
that check was for you right
but you knew somethin was off
thats cause youre good
youre like the best at what you do in the whole country arent you
irv looks at him
but you know what
if the country were run by people like you irving rosenfeld wed be living in eastern europe or guatemala
you ever been in guatemala
you ever been in jail in guatemala
you ever try to get a telephone or a permit or anything in guatemala
thats what this country would be like if we let people let the liars like you run this country
who made you god and judge
my grandmother lived to be ninety three years old
never lied in her life
im proud of that too
does that make her not a good person
is that not something to strive for
why you breaking my balls
get to the point
i see something in you irving
i get very excited
i think that we have a lot of potential here
i came up with the idea
its all from me
i want to change things
i want to go after white collar crime
irving youre very skilled
and i want you to teach me and we can do this
i want four people that do what you do
fake certificates of deposit
stolen art fake art
you get me four people and youre off the hook
four busts and youll leave us alone
we dont have to testify
youre good youre done
anything you want
but if you run then your life is over
youll be hunted and its gonna be very difficult for rosalyn and your kid to live in this country
a nice upper east side apartment
sydney has finally changed her clothing from when she wore the same dress at the holding cell
it is quiet in the apartment faint street noise from rd avenue below
we need to leave
we need to run and we need to do it now
we can go to estonia or romania i dont care well take the cash from the bed and get out of here alright
we talked about it a hundred times
irv stares at her and struggles
what about danny
what about danny
i adopted him
i gave him my name
im not leaving him with rosalyn shes unstable
thats a manipulation
rosalyns will never let you go
shell use danny against you because shes too messed up to let you leave
i cant leave him
i love him

richie said you would say that
what the cop

i cant leave danny
ill lose custody

sobbing what are you saying
oh my god
what are you doing
sydney goes storming out of the room and down the hall of her apartment
i cant believe this is happening
dont say i dont love you because thats bullshit
sobbing this is bullshit
you are bullshit
we are bullshit
she starts sobbing shaking
please dont do this
i just never thought you were conning me
i could never con you
i love you
please dont say this
irv walks to her and bends down to join her on the floor as she sobs
no im done
dont say that
cries im gonna do these four busts these four cons to get us out of this
not just me but us
and im gonna get really close with richie the cop in case we need to use him if we need another move
we dont need another move
we need four busts and were done
we are going to need another move trust me
and youre going to be thanking me
shifts to british accent the key to people is what they believe and what they want to believe and i want to believe that we were real and i want
to believe that a man could want me
and im gonna take all of that heartbreak and all of that sorrow and i am going to use it
and im going to make richie think that i want him and that i like him and im going to be very convincing and im pissed at you
sydney reaches over and carefully grabs irvings face lovingly which quickly turns into a slap as she continues on
because im pissed at you
irving stares at sydney with confusion
hes never seen her like this before
maybe i do like him maybe i like him a lot
from the feet up right baby
sydney gets up from the couch and storms back to her room
quite your belly aching and come up with something to get us out of this
and youre right im in no state to deal with this so whats it gonna be mister mastermind
an arab sheik
why do we need an arab sheik
richie in sharp lapeled suit chain on his neck walks with irv and edith and joined by a man who looks like an arab sheik who they trail
how do you think this works stupid
if you could not call him stupid which hes isnt hes smarter than you
last i checked hes in control here and we work for him now so be nice
richie stares at edith elated that she just stuck up for him
hes really enjoying this position of power shes putting him in
stares at her upset ok to set this up and bust a con artist we have to make the honey pot to attract the bees
in order to attract the bees we need to offer them a wealthy individual who can be taken advantage of someone special someone new someone amazing
then those guys will want to sell fake bank cds to that guy take the sheiks money see
richie looks at irving uncertain
only they cant get into his money unless you they know someone and that someone is us
oh thats good
so if you want to get somebody like your con artist friend carl elway you get him to want to buy keep your voice down
or sell fake art or stolen art or fake certificates of deposit he needs who does he need
he needs a rich sheik guy and there you go we can pinch him
right but i dont tell elway shit
i wait for him to call me
the art world is a small world and one of elways acquaintances is clocking us right now
richie starts to look around
richie looks anyway and sees elways acquaintance a man balding clocking them from the balcony

richie stares impressed

cause the guy who made this was so good that its real to everybody
now whose the master the painter or the forger
richies continues to stare at the rembrandt on the wall
thats a fake
thats the way the world works
not black and white as you say
elways acquaintance walks up to irving and the group and steps into the conversation
irving can i how many times i gotta tell you
you cant meet the sheik alright
edith sees this and steps into the conversation
weve met before
i wanted to introduce you to robert spencer
were advising the sheik together
she looks at richie
richie offers his hand
catching up yeah im robert spencer advisor to the sheik
carl elway preppie waspy very old fashioned with cigarette holder but something vaguely criminal about him in his conservative suit natty white and red striped shirt and navy blue tie
sits with irving
whats this i hear about a god damn sheik
why you leaving me out of this
i gotta hear about it from my friends
it aint for you carl
what do you mean it aint for me
we gotta do certificates of deposit
i can print as many as you need
this is not a one man operation
look i can get other guys
what are you talking about irving
youre telling me that you can get four guys to sell fake certificates of deposit to my investor within a week
the camera zooms into irvings shirt collar revealing a tiny microphone
yes i can make that happen
carl elway can do what he says hes going to do
thats interesting but you know ive got other guys lined up
ive got a meeting with my associates
richie dimaso and edith are standing there much to irvs carl his associates are here
hes got a meeting hes got to go to
dont go anywhere
ive got to go
irving gets up to walk out as richie and edith stand in the doorway
crazy thing about people the more you say no the more they want in on somethin
it is so stupid
irving looks over at richie and edith
ill tell them dont worry
hey you know what carl just told me
he said he could do this whole thing with four guys within a week
or we could do somethin much bigger
richie jumps into the conversation
my guy deals with hundreds of millions of dollars
how much bigger
he walks over to carl
hundreds of million i knew you were holdin out on me irving
hundreds of millions of dollars
like much bigger
like im talking about we say never the fuck mind the cds and we could have some complete access to something huge
introducing himself robert spencer advisor to the sheik
irv stares at richie with contempt then turns to edith i want you to think of the most undervalued asset in the state of new jersey today
the rebuilding of atlantic city
richie looks over at irving and sydney and mouths the word look maybe they maybe they legalized gambling a year ago but nothings happening
hey quit while youre ahead carl
i know the guy
i know the right people who are going to help you out
whose the guy
the guy is carmine polito
whose carmine polito
push in stoddard thorsen richies fbi supervisor
shakes his finger no carmine polito
carmine polito no
we freeze frame on stoddard as we hear richies vo as richie talks we see a short film about carmine polito push in mayor polito walks a camden street waves
shakes hands of well wishers my boss stoddard proceeded to tell me that carmine polito was the most quietly powerful person in the state of new jersey
a lifetime native of the very racially mixed camden which had become a ghetto and where he had been mayor for ten years
a very beloved guy
a guy who never gave up on his people
his father had emigrated from italy and had stoked coal
frank sinatras coffee song s version as we see carmine talk to and dance joyfully with his kids and wife at breakfast
a big family guy with five kids
they even adopted some other kid
a black kid from the boys and girls club whod lost his family
i mean his household was a joyous place
and his wife dolly she was the apple of his eye and the center of the household
i mean everyone loved this guy
pull out mayor polito walks up steps of city hall as he greets a women and her baby into his office greeted by a couple of aides who show him
papers to sign
and he had a huge heart
giving speech the w
employed craftsmen to paint this during the depression
why cant we employ people today to do work like this in rebuilding atlantic city
he worked with all the unions
he was the leader of the state assembly
and he had just gotten gambling legalized in new jersey to create jobs
floor of state assembly carmine huddles with other state legislators horsetrading and then poses for a picture with other members of the state assembly
but he couldnt get the funds to rebuild atlantic city and that was his problem
so with our help he was about to have his hand in the wrong pocket at the wrong time
and to me that meant corrupt you said grifters and con artists
were not going after some politician
this is a bad idea richard
look its really simple
all you need is to put two million in a chase account what
under the sheiks name whose two million
shh just listen
two million dollars under the sheiks name in a chase account that we control
carmine calls up on the telephone calls the bank and he sees that the sheik is real and he has a real account
im not taking two million dollars of the taxpayers money and putting it anywhere for five days i dont care if we control it the whole time
richie as he stares at stoddard in frustration
stoddard let us do what we need to do to rule out corruption and to get rid of the payoff guys that are ruining this country
thats my dream
dont smother it please
you know richard i understand your eagerness
i really do
you know im from michigan right
let me tell you a story about me and my dad and my brother
we used to go ice fishing every november
thats what we lived for
holy shit just listen to me
you have a little stove
you huddle around you keep each other warm
you drop a line and you just wait
one year my brother says lets go in october
he wants to go ice fishing in october
my dad says no the ice is too thin
my brother says i love my brother he says
i understand whats happening
youre saying your brother went out on the ice the ice was too thin he fell through the ice he went in the water because he was too eager and
youre saying im too eager thats what youre saying
no thats not what im saying
what are you saying
well finish the ice fishing story another time young man
for now no carmine polito
go do your job
richie looks at him annoyed and upset
stoddard shot the whole thing down
but edith was a genius
see b roll of edith and richie walk back into fbi building down corridor she somehow found this woman who controlled the wire room
a woman id never heard of
way back in a warren buried in the bureau
this cat lady nobody even talked to
edith met her in the ladies room and became friends with her
this lady handled all the wires and now she was working with us
edith and richie enter to find brenda fbi matronly older edith carries a basket of exotic teas
she was excited to be included in an operation instead of being on the other end of a memo
it was beautiful
edith goes to hand her the pimms cup and basket of teas
you said you liked exotic food so thats from england
thats from england
and i brought you some tea as well
thank you so much
nobody ever tells me about these operations they just say brenda do the clerical wiring work and dont ask questions
you need to tell richie about your cats
he loves them
oh my cats
brenda starts pointing out pictures of all her cats tacked to the walls amidst the wire memos and paperwork
well thats harry look at him standing up isnt that sweet
and thats wendy
shes a rascal
but barnaby thats another story
barnaby plays the piano
we got her to wire two million dollars into an f
controlled account at chase
itd be there for five days and if polito called hed see that the sheik was real
edith and richie laugh excitedly as they walk the hallways
by the time stoddard caught up to us edith made sure his boss was impressed by my idea
so before he even knew it was happening his boss was calling to congratulate him
im very impressed
that was very smart
the sheik with the money in the bank is a fantastic
dont be modest
he was the u
attorney and he had a major hard on to make a name for himself
i mean this guy loved the idea of being famous
and stoddard had to say it was his own idea or hed look stupid in front of his boss
push in on stoddard confused dismayed
thank you sir wait the sheik he hangs up pissed confused
you made me accept praise from my boss whos thanking me for something that never shoulda happened
something that i didnt approve
you should be happy
theres imaginative things happening in this office alright
were not just working in a box
richie leaves triumphant
we got the two million to put carmine and the sheik together
laughing richie and edith walk briskly on their way out
i liked being on this side of the line
but someone had been left out
we succeeded because we stayed small
i got you carl elway
he bought stolen art sold fake bank c
s thats enough
i get you three more no politicians
richie and edith look at him
youre gonna do this because you got no choice
you work for me
now you keep changing the rules
youre gettin a little power drunk richard
you want to tell him edith
you want to wake him up
oh no i said we shouldnt do any of it irving
you know i said that
so now i support richie
hes got vision
do it heavy or dont do it
i mean hes the one ruining america not me
how the hell am i ruining america
because people just got over watergate and vietnam alright
and youre gonna shit all over politicians again
and just because you want to be a big shot and get a promotion
no im thinking big
this is gonna be fantastic
were doing video surveillance
im doing this from the feet up
you will never do it properly because you got too much government attitude to be small and sleek
im like the fuckin vietcong man
im in and im out
i was there the whole time you dont know it
thats the fucking art of becoming somebody who people can pin their beliefs and their dreams on
and you cant do it
how about a suite at the sheraton hotel
for carmine polito and rebuilding atlantic city
you need a luxury hotel for the sheik
carmine does back door dealings all the time
we dont have a budget for that irving
you gotta knock the mayor the speaker of the state assembly you gotta knock him off of his fucking feet
hes gotta feel like hes out of his league
what youre offering this deal i mean this is unheard of in the state of new jersey maybe even the whole fucking country
a sheik with hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild atlantic city are you fuckin kidding me
and the mayor hes going to want to see cash hes going to want to see it in an account hes going to want to see it right now and
he will check
and thats why this meeting isnt happening because to get millions you need millions
edith listens intently
shrugs we already did it
irv studies richie and edith
we got the bureau to park million for three days we got the account numbers
we meaning you and him
yeah we did it
yeah me and that guy
she showed me
you showed him our thing
you did that without me
are you kidding me
what are you going to do
you playing me
are we doing this
or you playing him
itd be very bad for you if youre playing me
youre going to have to decide for yourself kid i just laid everything out on the table
this is all very exciting i never knew life could be like this
you know were taking down a very important politician
richie stands very close to edith between her legs as she sits on the counter
he puts his hands on her hips pulls her into him
he takes her hand puts it on his face makes her feel his cheek and forehead with her hand
it is intense
she prepares for him to kiss her but he steps back
they are both excited
they stare at each other
the air is thick with tension richie exhales and leaves
this is agent richard dimaso im placing into this briefcase for mayor carmine polito to procure casino license and building permits for atlantic city
where the film started see richie talk to camera in a corner of the plaza suite irvings eyes widen as we cut to richie slide the briefcase of cash as
seen before edith puts her hand on top of richies to stop him
carmine polito upset storms down the street as irving catches up
mayor please stop
listen i apologize if that prick offended you
i really apologize
carmine will not turn around irving catches up
really im all right thank you
im fucking embarrassed to be associated with that guy at all

irv smiles and nods as they walk back into the hotel together

irv and carmine eat breakfast
can i ask you a question

irving looks flummoxed
hes an arab
they look at each other

maybe its a dumb question but i was just wondering i would like to arrange for the sheik to see camden
to see the people of camden
the people i serve
the people i love
who are mostly black and puerto rican
i really want him to see how good this is going to be for the community how ready we are for this opportunity and he can see how far his

and you specifically bought this science oven for me
carmine stares meaningfully at irv yes

it means you gotta be committed to something in your life for christs sake
i want a jet at teterboro for the sheik
it can be a small jet

richie goes to walk out of stoddards office but stops at the door
so tell me the rest of the ice fishing story
where was i
your father woke you up it was a blizzard it was lake canoga
okay well my brother and i were on the ice and my father came out of the house and i could see him coming
he was holding a lantern and it was in the blizzard and i knew he was gonna be angry
so i went to intercept my father because i knew if he saw what my brother was doing he was going to kill him
richie cuts him off
so you tried to protect your brother but you couldnt and thats why you feel bad because youre trying to protect me and youre worried about me
is that what the storys about
no its not about protection
its not about protection
richie walks out the door
ros talks to herself carrying tin foil covered tray of lasagna
to herself dont put metal in the science oven dont put metal in the science oven rosalyn

she puts the tin foil lasagna into microwave
after a few moments it sparks explodes into flames
danny runs in

i told you not to put metal in the science oven
why did you do that for
dont make such a big deal

i dont want another one
i want the one that carmine gave me
i want the one carmine gave me
carmine carmine why dont you just marry carmine get a little gold microwave and put it on a chain around your neck
you want to be more like carmine

its empty just like your deals
its not bullshit
i read it in an article

ros stares defiantly clicks her nails on the counter

elton johns goodbye yellow brick road plays on the soundtrack as irv drives tinted glasses large comb over blue crushed velvet suit dark tie pan to visor mirror where rosalyn

irv tries to turn rosalyn away but she keeps turning back giving edith the hairy eyeball as edith gives it right back
i know who that is irving
off to the side richie steels himself with bump of cocaine before walking inside the old resort his eyes dilate
the entourage walks through the ornate lobby as edith and rosalyn continue to eyeball each other with irv uncomfortably in the middle as carmine enthusiastically continues his so this is
now mind you a week ago this place was a mess but what existed was this plasterwork

carmine leads all of them through the very crowded lobby as he talks
irving listens intently moved
people are gathered around blackjack roulette and craps tables playing and having a good time
we put in some temporary fun some gaming tables some play money for people to have a good time
for charity the boys and girls club and some arts programs
rosalyn walking with irving continues to stare daggers at edith who stays close to richie
carmine julius melora continue to lead everyone into carmine continues to walk this is the ocean room he pushes open double upholstered old doors the bar like the bemelmans bar
at the carlyle hotel in carmine pauses to stare at the men at the far bar five men as irv is pulled aside confidentially by carmine richie and edith watch rosalyn stands to the side carmine puts his arm around irvs shoulders there are some gentlemen over there at the bar
thats a hundred and thirty years sitting there thats how much times between them
they run the biggest casinos in the united states
we have to work with them
the good news is they know how its done
they get it done
you dont have to worry
everyone makes their money
you mean the mob
yes but theyre businessmen okay
now spend as much or as little time with them as you like but we do have to deal with them
all weve got to do is go say hello

edith looks on calm as richie wild eyed with cocaine and carmine maybe im not sure thats such a good idea
we gotta confer before we talk to these guys
interrupting hopped up confer

theyre casino guys
they are businessmen
we came all this way irving

theres nothing to be scared of
richie stares down irv edith pulls richie back rosalyn is starting to go down a spiral of depression as she looks increasingly uncomfortable
re the mob guys those are the guys youre all scared of
those guys over there
they dont scare me
she glares at edith and irv and pivots to walk to the bar
but shes already on her way over to the mafia men at the bar who greet her warmly as irv edith richie and carmine watch
i love this
rosalyn walks up to pete musane charismatic and sits down in between all the mafia guys
the other three salt and pepper mafia guys laugh and talk with rosalyn who gulps a glass of prosecco and is refilled by pete musane
can i sit here
carmine whispers to irv as he watches rosalyn talk to the mafia guys
irving this is not a good idea
how you guys doing
everybody over there is really scared of you guys you know that
she knocks back the prosecco
she seems relieved
dolly ushers her kids to the door
kids i want you to go up and get some pizza and soda please
irving and edith watch in horror at rosalyn
its a disaster
i think they have this room all wrong
what would you do
i would do it in all black and gold and i would do this bar like a big warm golden mirror
rosalyns smitten by the mobsters
but you expect that from her because shes so beautiful oh stop
i love her hair so i know im gonna love how shed do the room he touches the front of her huge farrah overhang bangs
richie irving carmine and the sheik walk up to them
how do you do
to richie im sorry is she your wife
no shes my wife
shes my wife
look at these fine gentleman
carmine there you are
how you doing
irving takes the glass of prosecco out of rosalyns hand and puts it on table
its because hes a party pooper
hes so boring
irving stares fuming at rosalyn and the guys he nods and forces a smile good naturedly as they put prosecco glass in his hand
he knows how to fake it
you have a very beautiful wife
they all laugh
richie guides sheik with one body guard
may i present sheik abdullah gentlemen from abu dhabi
sheik these men are professionals they run the best casinos in the united states
the sheik acknowledges them with a nod
irv is extremely uncomfortable
sheik as a sign of our seriousness mr
tallegio came from miami to meet you tonight
why didnt you tell me mr
tallegio was here
hes in the back room
its a sign of disrespect to do business on the first meeting
thats not true
i dont know what your talking about
to musane hes got it all wrong
well dont leave him back there in the back room waiting
come on lets go
rosalyn reaches to have her glass refilled by dick helsing when one of the other guys nudges her hip in her tight dress and she drops into pete musanes lap
hey irving im going to be having fun
maybe it will be contagious
irving turns and heads with dread towards the back door with carmine richie and the sheik
sydney worried about rosalyn with musane decides to hang back
victor tellegio was from miami
he was meyer lanskys right hand man
in his prior reputation as an enforcer from twenty years ago he was known to never bury a body because he felt it sent a stronger message to leave it
in the street
this is the guy we now had to deal with
impromptu table and chairs
carmine greets him
you sure you dont want to go into the ocean bar
its really its beautiful in there
im very happy i dont have to go there
i like it here
theres an exit
im like a ghost
nobody knows im here
busboys whip open a white table cloth for the table
everyone sits down
tellegio looks at the sheik then over to richie
tell him i speak for our friends in florida
were very excited
its been our lifelong dream to build casino resorts on the east coast
richie pretends to translate in the sheiks ear
you told him that
they didnt want the jews to make money they didnt want the italians to make money definitely dont want the blacks to make money
after the oil embargo the gasoline crisis the hijackings the olympics they dont want to see arabs make money trust me not on our soil
you can tell him this in your own way ive been in the casino business forty years
its scrutinized more carefully than any other business
carmine made this legal but we must be careful or theyll take it away
so mister tellegio how do you think we should approach this
what do you want to do
if you want to get the gaming license and keep it we have to make our principal investor here the sheik an american citizen
irving and richie both look at victor intensely not sure where this is going
to expedite citizenship well that requires very special treatment
you would know the right people to do that carmine
carmine knows everybody
what are we talking about
wow thats fantastic
i say stay away from that
no thats not good
who is this guy
to irving what are you a farmer
richie and tellegio both laugh
tellegio im sorry this is irving
new york businessman
whats the matter irving
whats the problem
dont get your balls in an uproar
everythings fine everythings good
its all good
its all good
i just hope the other part of this is all good
because were real
you know that
you deal with us
were a real organization
we deal with you we dont know what were dealing with
everyone stares increasingly tense at tellegio in silence
this could go wrong at any minute
tellegio looks over to richie and points to the sheik
irving watches in horror as wheres he from
winging it abu dhabi
oh hes from the emirates
in subtitled arabic can i count on you
you gotta be honest about this
do you understand me
good means good
to sheik did you hear what i said
do you want me to repeat it
irving looks ill as does everyone else at the table
what do you think now
uh i think i think what hes
no let him speak for himself
sheik swallows hard and looks to richie
its a very tense moment for everyone at the table
everyone hangs on this
irving and richie share a look what is he doing
a drunk al kowalski a working man friend of the mayor barrels into into the table spilling drinks
tellegios guys jump in and grab him and start to pull him away
no i know him
you guys are way too serious for a party
to tellegio hey what are you drinking
you got a drink
to al were in a very serious meeting
to tellegio i apologize
i understand youre in conference
you gotta come with me now
you got a speech to give
everyones waiting for you
al ill be right behind you okay
paco hernandez sheik stands up and reaches over to tellegio to shake his hand
the menacing deep bass in arabic it is great doing business with you
the investment is real
it was a pleasure to meet you
irving exhales in relief that paco managed to say anything passable in arabic
what are the odds of an italian guy from miami knowing arabic
but it turns out hes got casino investments in the mideast and he spent two years learning it to keep the upper hand
victor leans over to talk to carmine
listen to me carefully
if youre real you put ten million in the bank of our choice in the next two weeks
carmine listen to me carefully if youre real you put ten million in the bank of our choice in the next two weeks or not only will the sheik feel
insulted but our friends in florida will feel deeply disrespected and so will i
irving looks at victor who stares back at him
this is bad
rosalyn you need to come with me alright
i dont need to come with you
you need to come with me
this needs to stop
oh you think i should come with you
yeah you need to come with me right now
rosalyn takes her wrist out of sydneys grasp
why dont you get your fucking hands off me you fucking whore
youre a whore

dolly escorts edith over to one side of the room away from rosalyn
you stay over here with me
everybody just calm down
i dont know whats going on
pete looks over to rosalyn
take it easy
these things happen
whatevers meant to be will be
rosalyn smiles at pete
thats what i always say

rosalyn looks in mirror sadness anger fear
edith rushes in
what the hell do you think youre doing
what the hell do i think im doing
what the fuck do you think youre doing
you really gonna come in here and judge me for flirting with somebody after youve been fucking my husband for how many years

rosalyn holds her hand with wedding ring to sydneys face
i got a ring on my finger
we have a child together
he doesnt love you rosalyn he loves me
and you know it and i know it and he knows it
and it might be done now but it was beautiful and it was real
and we loved each other
rosalyn starts to tear up
you scare him and you manipulate him and you use your son
well he must like it on some level
he must want it because he keeps coming back for it
its like that perfume that you love that you cant stop smelling even when theres something sour in it
you cant get enough of it
but guess what hes never gonna leave me
hes always going to want me and i will make you so sorry edith
i will make you so sorry for what youve done to my family mark my words
that is fucked up
i would never say anything that fucked up to anybody but you do because youre gross inside youre so fucked up and gross
oh im gross inside
maybe youre gross inside with robbing people and all that shit that you do
maybe were both gross inside thats what irving loves about us
at least hes consistent with his women
you know sometimes in life all you have are fucked up poisonous choices
rosalyn reaches over grabs sydneys face and kisses her
rosalyn laughs a toxic tough front dark laugh and walks out
sydney looks into the mirror and wipes the lipstick off her lips as rosalyn storms out of the powder room
we need to talk
this is serious
ladies and gentlemen your friend the working mans friend my friend mayor carmine polito
on stage carmine takes mic irving stands off to the side of the stage as his world closes in around him
pulls his heart pills out of his pocket and takes one
sydney sees this as she stands nearby with richie
irv edith richie watch near stage jostled
rosalyn enters the ball room looking disheveled as she is guided by pete musane looks to stage

crowd roars wildly
irv watches moved and destroyed
irving walks in with his keys same clothes from night before as ocean sounds continue takes a gun from the safe and he stands looking lost and lonely he turns
on the electric dry cleaning rack where he and sydney stood together in love

red faced like he may hit her a vein stands out in his neck
he screams like an animal in confusion and frustration
richie in pain holds his cut forehead and eyebrow
in pain and dismay they hear a door open off screen someone approaches
irving appears from around the corner of the wall pointing his handgun at richie
will you please step away from edith
im asking you nicely please step away from edith right now

irving and sydney stare
slowly because when tellegio finds out what happened do you think hes gonna go after me
i dont think so

richie picks up phone as they watch he dials
intercut on phone stoddard thorsen
slowly intensely youre going to give me the sherman suite

richie slams the phone down storms out the apartment
you were right
we should have gone away
irving sits in the corner of the room a disheveled mess
sydney sits on the bed drinking a fresca
i should have gone away with you
we were supposed to do it from the feet up like you always said
thats how we were meant to do it but you didnt do it like that
you didnt do it like that
you played it safe so there was always a danger you were going to end up with rosalyn in the dead space floating on some dead spaceship with the furniture
and the curtains
and i was your life line out and you were mine and that was ok
irving stares at her emotional i wish i could get you back
he walks across the room and sits down on the bed next to sydney
you know i cant do it without you
you know that
me you and danny
like we said
like i said
you never said that
i said that
we gotta get over on all these guys
thats what we need to be thinking about right now
irving takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes
whatever it is its got to be the best weve ever done
sydney nods her head yes stares intensely at irving as the camera tilts down to reveal their hands clasped together
high ceiling old office
close on a tape recorder
opposite prosecutor amado the tape recorder and microphone sit on the desk in front of stoddard as he records a statement for a report
agent dimaso called me late at night on the st
i believe that he was intoxicated
he threatened me and i told him this was inappropriate
i told him procedures exist for reasons we must respect
this is the third such call i received from agent dimaso
he called me again the night of the th and he threatened to kill me
subsequently he demanded that i allow him to use the sherman suite at the plaza hotel for purposes of bribing members of congress
camera pull back reveals the chastened richie sits listening in a suit and tie
hes in trouble with their boss the prosecutor
i am so sorry
im not finished
theres a lot more
richie gets up and pulls up a chair next to stoddard
stoddard flinches and moves away like hes going to get hit again
i have nothing but the utmost respect for you as my mentor
he reaches down and turns the tape recorder off and as my re the recorder what are you doing
i just want to talk from my heart
i dont want it on record
i want to get vulnerable
can i finish
can i finish my statement
i respect you
i think you do other things besides respect me
stoddard paces while on the phone holds up a finger to richie to wait richie picks up stoddards phone rips the cord out and smashes stoddard across the face with
doesnt stop til stoddard falls to the ground knocks over desk chair and bookcase behind
they stare at each other
its just hard for me to control my passion
im a very passionate person
looks to amado youre from new york
you understand this
he goes ice fishing in the midwest
that was told to you in confidence
hes an ice fishing guy
look at him
where we left off
stoddard reaches with bloodied hands across what is he reaching for
oh on a small table a gun and a clip
what are you doing pulling out your gun
thats not you
no its me
this is me
dont do something that you dont know anything about
richie grabs his gun and starts to load it
ill show you how its done
im not even going to hit you
he points the gun at stoddard
watch this fucko
richie and stoddard stare at each other in silence
so you want to use the sherman suite
the entire floor
stoddard throws his head back looks at ceiling in exasperation
at the plaza hotel
what happened to the mafia
i thought you were this is where they intersect
this is where the two things intersect
the politicians and the mafia
victor tellegios people who run resorts international victor tellegio showed his face
i sat with him
i sat with victor tellegio
i hung out with him
we can get him
we can get his whole organization as well as getting any number of congressmen
i mean thats just peeling the first layer of the onion
how you going to do that
we would get ten million dollars and put it into an account ten million dollars
ten million dollars
and thats how we just let them know were for real
what does he say hes gonna do for the ten million dollars
how are we trapping him
he promises to build casinos handle the skims do the licencing
and you have him on tape saying this
you have that right
to richie i want you to find a safer way to get victor tellegio on a wire
no ten million dollars thats crazy
richie looks down defeated
even to entrap tellegio its crazy
but you can have the sherman suite stoddard please to go and get me some congressmen
go get some congressmen taking bribes
i want to pinch us some congressmen ok
you come back to me
im proud of you
then as an afterthought and stoddard
richie and stoddard walk down large echoey federal building corridor
stoddard walking ten feet ahead turns and points at richie
shouts bitterly good luck keeping your job by the way and staying out of jail and not being killed by the mob
but other than that youre doing a great job
stoddard turns and storms off
as stoddard walks away whats the end of the ice fishing story
im not telling you the end of the ice fishing story
im going to call your fucking brother and find out from him
my brothers dead
thats how it ends
he fell through the fucking ice
shouts bitterly no its not
he died a different way many years later
he storms off and leaves richie staring in the hallway
richie walks out of a surveillance room and down the hallway to where irv and sydney wait

i think we can stick together and still fulfill our goal
i mean we got the sherman suite

richie gestures to his eye that sydney smashed with the picture frame

richie looks over to irving
hey you ok

irving doesnt know what to say starts to say something twice stops cant think of what to say
leaves richie hanging
richie directs where cameras should be concealed
agents you can put a camera here
and we get it all on film
you like it
to schmidt give me those flowers
if we put the flower base here and put a camera in there we can get a clear shot of the couch there where we can put the congressmen
irving sitting on the couch looks kind of disturbed by this
thats the idea
and carmine will go to jail after he delivers us the congressmen soon to be felons
carmines aid melora answers a ringing phone as carmine sits at his desk

theres only one thing that can really fuck this up and thats your wife
rosalyn fixes dannys coat hands him his lunch and sends him off towards the schools front door close up rosalyn stares into lens
emotional a mixture of sadness and hope
she holds a closed bottle of her favorite nail finish and smells it nostalgically
he gently puts a hand on her knee
she leaves it there for a moment before pushing it away
they stare at each other
i dont like your husband
youre no good together
he doesnt appreciate you
hey it happens
it happened in my marriage
thats why i went to miami
sometimes you just gotta be tough
you gotta stand up and you gotta leave you know
rosalyn looks at pete smitten
sometimes you gotta let something die to let something live
youre too beautiful to be unhappy
i mean i dont want to badmouth my husband but let me badmouth my husband for a second
he just thinks that he knows everything and hes so full of shit

rosalyn and pete hold hands as rosalyn stares into his eyes

he kisses her

pete gets up and walks
as he does dont hurt him too bad

irv and carmine down sidewalk leaving from the plaza hotel pete musane stands next to an open passenger side door irv and carmine do not move they stare at the
rosalyn in full muumuu wearing cleaning gloves and holding a vacuum sings to live and let die while danny sits on the couch watching her
irving and carmine sit up front with pete driving and dick helsing sits in the back seat looking angry
rosalyn continues to sing and gets more intense as the music picks up
irving looks over to pete nervously
unsure of whats going to happen
rosalyn whips her head up and down dancing manically through the house
rosalyn sits on the bed with danny with clothes all over the place while smoking a cigarette
life is ridiculous and i would never say anything bad about your father in front of you but your father is a sick son of a bitch
daddys a sick son of a bitch
dont repeat that
irvings caddy comes screeching up to the house and parks in the driveway
irv gets out and races inside
rosalyn is still sitting on the bed with danny
shouts rosalyn looks scared
this is a real low in our relationship
you know where i was recently
i was in your boyfriends fucking car
i saw your nail polish
windshield smells it worried
carmine glances over his shoulder anxiously at dick helsing in the back seat
whats this i hear about your curly haired friend working for the government
who said that
irving is surprised to hear this
screams hey what the fuck
shut the fuck up
what are you talking about
get out of here
im not doing anything
irving looks down to see danny sitting there on the bed
come here buddy alright
go draw a picture or something
irving ushers danny out of the room
youre a real sick son of a bitch for screaming at me like that in front of danny
hes a mobster alright
thats who youre dealing with
yes i wanted to hurt you but how do you think that i feel all day when you leave me alone all day
and all ive ever wanted is for you to love me
thats all i ever wanted
and stay married and for you to love me
and thats why im going to miami
youre not going to miami
thats why im going to miami with pete
irving picks up rosalyns clothes from the bed where there is an open suitcase throws them back in the closet
you are not going to miami
i finally found somebody who loves me just like you always wanted
irv continue to throw clothes back into the closet
he likes me just the way i am
everything has to stay normal right now
and youre going to shut your mouth
you told me that you wanted me to find a nice quiet man
oh and what a doozy you picked
hes the one
hes the most dangerous guy ever
irving reaches for his heart pills but they fall out of his hands and scatter on the floor
he bends down to grab them and almost falls
rosalyn helps him up
why arent you taking your heart pills
irving whats going on
what kind of trouble are you in
out of breath ive got a plan
irving coughs and steps back
out of breath and very winded
ive got a plan
youve got a plan
when did you get it
it really fucking came to me when i was inside of that canvas bag with your boyfriends hands around my throat
thats when it really came to me
take it off
take the bag off his head
dick pulls the bag off irvings head his comb over is all messed up
pete and dick laugh weve got two million coming this week
what do you think this is
you think this is a fucking down payment plan
like were sears of chevrolet
you ask victor if he wants two million this week
thats real money
they laugh irvings hair is all messed up
pete patches out
irving and carmine are a mess shirts ripped open no buttons they look at each other very shaken
is it true
is it true what he said about your wife
its not fucking true
thats not true
i can save all of us and we can save money
i can take care of you and danny
but you gotta close your mouth
rosalyn looks satisfied and points her finger at irving
i knew it
i have always said irving that you are very very hard to motivate properly
and i knew that pete was gonna go over there and knock some sense into you
ive been reading this book irving
its by wayne dyer about the power of intention
irving cant believe what hes hearing right now
rosalyn very satisfied reaches over the bed and grabs a book
and my intention in sending pete over to you was so that you could come up with this plan
so youre welcome
irving incredulous thinks to himself how to respond
forces himself to say gently ok
thank you rosalyn
thank you for the plan
i appreciate that
so i think that we should be partners on this
im a good partner
almost better than edith
you ever think about that
you ever think about how you might have underestimated me
so what is our plan
tell me the plan
what are you gonna do
im going to keep my mouth shut and im not going to say anything but what do i do if pete calls me
what am i supposed to say
you gotta stop talking about your government agencies and your i
and your tax and your conspiracies and all of that
youre gonna say how you were wrong you were wrong about that
ill tell pete that i was wrong but you know that in real life i was right for saying all that stuff because then that spurred on the actions that
made you come up with this plan
so i will tell pete
holding his head pointing with cigarette between fingers the power of intention irving
the power of intention
irv is doing everything he can to hold it together
you were right
rosalyn gets up from the bed and walks over to irving
youre so smart
good job peaches
irving ive been doing a lot of thinking and you need to grow up
and you need to face the facts
and i think that both of us will be a lot happier if we get a divorce
as he listens to words he has been saying himself for months now spoken as rosalyns idea
just think about it
kisses him these things are never easy
irving starts walking away towards the door
good luck with your plan
the spare rhythmic intro of jeff lynnes long black road plays as richie looks back over his shoulder and walks towards the building with intensity
necessity truly is the mother of invention
was willing to wire the two million dollars if it meant taking down tellegio and his entire organization
brenda in her office
amado looking very pleased on the telephone
irving walks with richie and sydney up to an office building
a mobster like tellegio would never meet at the plaza hotel but only at the office of his attorney alfonse simone
they walk into mob lawyer simones building
on an old faded directory th floor alfonse simone
they open door to large spare reception area of alfonse simones law office
middle aged secretary looks up and picks up the phone
alfonse simone rises from behind his desk
a silent secretary sitting at his side in a white dress stares at our heros as simone steps forward to introduce himself
edith walks up to him to shake hands
he shakes hands with irving and richie as well
man in the suit closes the door behind them
please be seated
they sit in three chairs facing simones desk sydney edith richie irving
simone sits behind his desk the silent secretary sits just behind him slightly to the side stares at edith richie irving
i appreciate the fact that you all came in person but the trip was really unnecessary because this whole thing could have been done with a simple wire transfer
as a matter of fact this is the number of our wire right here
simone slides a small pink piece of paper across the desk to them
richie stares at the paper but doesnt touch it
where is mr
tellegio unfortunately was called out of town on business
thats not good
we were willing to come here today in person to see mr
tellegio as a sign of respect to give two million dollars i can assure you that i have the power of attorney excuse me
if youll let me finish we are willing to give two million dollars today of the ten
but without mr
tellegio here to simone we cant we cant make that decision
its not the right thing
its not the right time
its just not good
to irving across richie you dont have the authorization to make this kind of choice so dont be hasty alright
im not being hasty
its just lets be smart about it
this is not how we do business
to simone im sorry
richie motions with his hand to edith that he agrees with irving
hes right we cant
i think you should hang in there
the guys not here
he stands goes to the door
this is a surprise
the sheik doesnt like surprises
edith turns in her chair to face them in the doorway
in doorway with richie edith this is not your decision to make
i understand but maybe we can call the sheik
lets call the sheik
thats not the plan
thats not the edith locks eyes with richie
richie stares at edith waves irving off with his hand
no lets ill call the sheik
to simone can i use your phone
to alfonse simone i dont know if hes in ill call the sheik
but before i do id like to go over specifically what this money will be used for
what we will do is we guarantee all proper licenses and construction permits for any hotel casino that plans to open before the end of the year
richie glances down at edith and her handbag
push in on a and well throw in the customary privileges and protection
what if there are obstacles what will you do
we are prepared to overcome any obstacles
this is a big enterprise
if we have to pay somebody off well pay somebody off
if we have to lean on somebody intimidate somebody well intimidate somebody
this is our business
thats powerful stuff
and ill tell you something else
at the end of this well teach you how to skim and how to cut it up and make some money on the side
because we invented skimming
weve been doing it for thirty years
a smile creeps across richies face
thank you for clarifying that
richie picks up the phone to dial
i think that will be ok for the sheik
this is the sheik
on phone mr
tellegio is not here
its just mr
alfonse simone his lawyer
are we still ok to wire the money
simone can take the money
whats the number
amado writes it down and hands it to brenda to call in
the funds have been transferred
on phone to richie the funds have been transferred
amado nods victory
richie hangs up
the moneys been wired
i think we have a deal
yes we do sir
pleasure doing business with you
okay well thank you very much mr
the sheiks very excited
im sure that well be seeing each other
richie and team start to walk out
grinning oh im sure well be seeing each other very soon
you may even get sick of me like these two
i dont think ill get sick of you
nice meeting you
richie edith and irving walk down the hall after leaving his office
richie smiles as the opening of bowies the jean genie momentously starts
edith smiles as she walks down the hall followed by irving
richie puts his hand on the door knob to exit the hallway
shouts through clamor were ambitious thats why
richie suddenly moves to the reel to reel surveillance tape and quiets the room the music momentarily stops as we hear alfonse simone on the surveillance tape
shh shh shh
if we have to pay somebody off well pay somebody off
if we have to lean on somebody intimidate somebody well intimidate somebody
richie joyfully lip synchs to the rhythm of simones incriminating words on tape
in unison with simone on tape if we have to lean on somebody intimate somebody well intimidate somebody
irvings big blue car pulls up to the lens
irving and sydney looking a little uneasy
irving stares at the house
i gotta do it
what do you mean theres no sheik
what does that mean theres no sheik
what does that mean
carmine stares at irving
i want to face you like a man because i want to be real now
who is they
irving looks distressed
hes a wreck
its the feds
irving im a good person you are
carmine stands up and looks around the room disoriented his life passing before his eyes
ive been doing this for a long time for twenty years
do you think i woulda taken that money if it wasnt the right thing to do
hey look youre a good person i know that but in all honesty screams you said that was the only way irv

everything i do is for them
am i lying to you
i never had a friend like you before
i used that money for the goddamn casino
i got some leverage alright

this is all shit
its all bullshit
carmine picks up the knife the sheik gave him
look at this thing
look at this
ceremonial fucking knife
what is this bullshit
he drops it on the table
irving stares at his friend removes his glasses
carmine syd and i got a plan for you
we can help you out
please get out of my house irving
will you please leave
im asking you nicely please leave
irving gets up to go and is pushed towards the door by carmine
dolly joins carmine in tears
carmines kids stand on the stairs
get out of our house
i dont want to seeing kids im sorry
i didnt mean for this to happen
to kids this is not our friend
truly i didnt mean for this to happen
carmine points to his family
this is what matters to me most and youre crushing it
youre going to take me away from them you fucking son of a bitch
get the fuck out
carmine lunges at irving and punches him in the face
irving goes down to the ground and his glasses fly off his face
carmine kicks him one last time
beaten bloody on floor i just want to make it right
get out of my house
look what you made me do
stumbling out the door im sorry carmine im sorry
irving staggers out of the house in an emotional daze one hand to his heart falls to sidewalk with bloody nose and broken glasses irving
your heart pills
where are your heart pills
she digs through his pockets finds the pills and feeds one to him
sydney struggles to help irving to his feet and together an embattled but surviving couple they cross the street arm and arm
she opens the door and helps him into the car
ive got to lay down
she gets in and closes the door
they both slump down on the seat stare at each other emotional humbled
sydney gently removes irvings broken glasses
they stare at each other it is quiet
emotional quiet are you ready
they stare at each other
whispers i love you
she squeezes his hand raises it to her lips and kisses it
they all sit
do you know where our two million dollars is
irving pushes his new glasses up the bridge of his nose its with victor tellegio and alfonse simone
no actually its not with victor tellegio or alfonse simone
richie stands by the window stares angrily at irving
he fucking knows about it
its gone missing
did you know that
wheres it gone
thats interesting that you said that because while you were on your way over here we got an anonymous phone call from someone who said that in exchange for immunity
for the two of you and a reduced sentence for carmine polito we get our two million dollars back
thats very interesting
i have no idea
no idea what youre talking about
irving looks at sydney who looks back at him and shakes her head
she doesnt know either
i got it
i understand how these deals are made
see someone has leverage
anthony fuck them
we got them for wire fraud its over
to irving and sydney youre done
youre both done
i dont think so
oh you dont think so
richard think about it you requested the two million
and you gave brenda the account number
we didnt do any of that
none of it
turns dramatically to face richie how do we know that you dont have the money
richie looks from irving to sydney am i living in a fucking nightmare right now
i find this a little offensive
really i find this a little offensive and i dont see that you got any sort of solid case against to amado and stoddard dont let him get in your
listen to me were dealing with a very clever individual
richard think about it
you got some big arrests
you got u
you look good
youre gonna be all over the news
you know what doesnt look good
a story about gross incompetence i have a warrant for richie looks around disoriented we cannot see what he sees yet
im sorry do i have the wrong office
checks number on the door is this
my name is roger thigpen
ive had this office for years
im a divorce attorney
you lost two million dollars of taxpayer money because you were confused about the location and the identity of victor tellegios attorney
where we first saw irving at the pool party
the role of tellegios attorney alfonse simone was played by our friend ed malone camera pans from irving to ed malone the cold cut king of long island ed malone
holds up two packages of cold cuts
also holding the cold cuts are the two that frisked everyone at simones office
whose party we were at when sydney and i first met
cut to irving first meeting sydney
ed malone dressed as alfonse simone steps to camera to shake richies hand
people believe what they want to believe richie
thats because you conned me
you both fucking conned me
you both got under me
well that doesnt sound so good either
i mean and i dont know what youre talking about but lets just assume you want to go with that story
thats the story you want to go with
thats what you want the new york times to hear
that you got conned by the very con men who you forced to entrap the members of congress in the first place
thats what you want to go with
that doesnt sound so good for your whole thing
richie looks like hes going to be sick
and how ironic that the most creative minds the ones who are working hardest to get the economy of new jersey going those are the ones that you round up
because what theyre the easiest to go after
and what about the real bullshit artists
you didnt even come close to the big leagues
those big guys
the money men
thats what i was trying to go after
im sorry to tell you you got none of em
you know richard i think we may call you as a witness but otherwise youre done
i think you better go home
richie disoriented appeals to stoddard
stoddard go on home richard
elos overture reprises on the soundtrack
camera tilts down from the federal building to find richie coming down the stairs emotional
richie walks wiping his eyes his innocence and edith lost
we took down some very big guys
some of whom were just doing business as usual helping their communities or their states
but some of them knew they had larceny in their blood
and they even admitted it
grey haired senator horton mitchell wife by his side denies any wrongdoing and is photographed and humiliated as he then sits with her in a federal car
but in all it was six congressmen one united states senator and my friend carmine polito
we gave the two million back so carmine got the reduced sentence
the loss of his friendship would haunt me for the rest of my life
and when the story was written richard dimasos name was never mentioned
syd and i moved in together
and rosalyn rosalyn in a neck brace and off white trench coat and sunglasses
the car is a little dinged up and im a little stiff but i dont want to talk about it
irving stares at rosalyn
she would always be interesting
rosalyn gets in to a car revealing pete musane in the drivers seat
irving leans in
to irving you know my boss knows you did him a solid
yes i did
he never took a nickle so they cant get him for nothing
i was never going to let that happen
irving starts to leave irv
he stops and looks at her
with red lacquered nails rosalyn places her favorite nail finish in his hand
im done with this nail finish
bye for now
ill see you next weekend
rosalyn drives off with pete
sydney stands with danny
our conning days were behind us
irving and sydney walk hand and hand with danny down the street
irv drops the nail finish into a trashcan
you can fool yourself for just so long and then your next reinvention better have your damn feet on the ground
irving and sydney admire a piece of art on the wall
we got a loan from a bank and were able to go gallery legitimate
irving and sydney sit in front of a banker asking for a loan
the art of survival is a story that never ends
