the usual suspects the usual suspects written by christopher mcquarrie produced and directed by bryan singer revised white revised blue revised pink revised yellow the lonely sound of a buoy
bell in the distance
water slapping against a smooth flat surface in rhythm
the creaking of wood
off in the very far distance one can make out the sound of sirens
suddenly a single match ignites and invades the darkness
it quivers for a moment
a dimly lit hand brings the rest of the pack to the match
a plume of yellow white flame flares and illuminates the battered face of dean keaton age forty
his salty gray hair is wet and matted
his face drips with water or sweat
a large cut runs the length of his face from the corner of his eye to his chin
it bleeds freely
an un lit cigarette hangs in the corner of his mouth
in the half light we can make out that he is on the deck of a large boat
a yacht perhaps or a small freighter
he sits with his back against the front bulkhead of the wheel house
his legs are twisted at odd almost impossible angles
he looks down
a thin trail of liquid runs past his feet and off into the darkness
keaton lights the cigarette on the burning pack of matches before throwing them into the liquid
the liquid ignites with a poof
the flame runs up the stream gaining in speed and intensity
it begins to ripple and rumble as it runs down the deck towards the stern
a stack of oil drums rests on the stern
they are stacked on a palette with ropes at each corner that attach it to a huge crane on the dock
one of the barrels has been punctured at its base
gasoline trickles freely from the hole
the flame is racing now towards the barrels
keaton smiles weakly to himself
the flame is within a few yards of the barrels when another stream of liquid splashes onto the gas
the flame fizzles out pitifully with a hiss
two feet straddle the flame
a stream of urine flows onto the deck from between them
the sound of a fly zipping
follow the feet as they move over to where keaton rests at the wheel house
crane up to the waist of the unknown man
he pulls a pack of cigarettes out of one pocket and a strange antique lighter from the other
it is gold with a clasp that folds down over the flint
the man flicks up the clasp with his thumb and strikes it with his index finger
it is a fluid motion somewhat showy
keaton looks up at the man
a look of realization crosses his face
it is followed by frustration anger and finally resignation
how are you keaton
id have to say my spine was broken keyser
he spits the name out like it was poison
the man puts the lighter back in his pocket and reaches under his jacket
he produces a stainless
what time is it
the hand with the gun turns over turning the gold watch on its wrist upward
the sound of sirens is closer now
headed this way
keaton grimaces bitterly and nods
he turns his head away and takes another drag
the hand with the gun waits long enough for keaton to enjoy his last drag before pulling the trigger
the sound of keatons body slumping onto the deck
move out across the deck
below is the stream of gasoline still flowing freely
the sound of the gasoline igniting
the flame runs in front of us towards the barrels finally leaping up in a circle around the drums burning the wood of the pallet and licking the spouting stream
as it pours from the hole
move out across the dock away from the boat
the pier to which the boat is moored is littered with dead bodies
twenty or more men have been shot to pieces and lie scattered everywhere in what can only be the aftermath of a fierce fire fight
on the deck of the barge is a tangle of cables and girders
the mesh of steel and rubber leaves a dark and open cocoon beneath its base
sirens are close now
the sound of fire raging out of control
new light flickering in the surrounding darkness
we hear the voice of roger verbal kint whom we will soon meet
six weeks ago
a truck loaded with stripped gun parts got jacked outside of queens
the driver didnt see anybody but somebody fucked up
he heard a voice
sometimes thats all you need
the black explodes with the opening of a door into a dark room
outside the hall is filled with blinding white light
shadows in the shapes of men flood into the room
we can make out men in hoods with flashlights
they are laden with weapons
it is a blur of violent action and sound
beams of flashlights cut the darkness in all directions
a dozen flashlights land on one man
he lies naked in bed merging from a deep sleep
he squints at the flood of blinding white light more annoyed than frightened
he nearly laughs at the sound of countless guns cocking
he is mcmanus
age twenty eight
we have a warrant for your arrest
mcmanus will they be serving coffee downtown
two dozen black gloved hands grab him and yank him out of bed
an old paint mixer vibrates furiously
todd hockney a dark portly man in his thirties is working on an old fire bird
a young hispanic kid mixes paint a few feet away
suddenly the garage door opens to reveal a row of five men silhouetted by the bright sun
can i help you
hockneys voice is gruff
todd hockney hockney reaches for something just inside the door of the fire bird
who are you
all six men instantly produce guns and aim them at hockney
hockney withdraws a filthy towel and wipes grease and sweat from his forehead
we dont do gun repair
fred fenster a tall thin man in his thirties strolls casually down the street
he is dressed conspicuously in a loud suit and tie with shoes that have no hope of matching
he smokes a cigarette and chews gum at the same time
he happens to glance over his shoulder and notice a brown ford sedan with four men in it cruising along the curb
he picks up his step a little
the ford keeps up
he looks ahead at the corner
he tries to look as comfortable as he can checking his watch as though remembering an appointment he is late for
the ford stays right on him
suddenly he bolts
he gets no more than a few yards before cars pour out of every conceivable nook and cranny
brakes are squealing radios squawking guns cocking
fenster is surrounded instantly
he stops short and flaps his hands on his thighs in defeat
an attractive man and woman walk quickly through the front of a small new york cafe
they are charged with nervous excited energy
the man is dean keaton a well dressed sturdy looking man in his forties with slightly graying hair
he looks much better than he did in the opening scene
the woman with him is edie finneran age thirty three poised and attractive easily the calmer of the two
they come to a staircase at the back of the restaurant leading down to a dark room
edie takes keatons arm and stops him
let me look at you
keaton is uncomfortable in his suit or perhaps the situation
still he smiles with genuine warmth
edie straightens his tie and picks microscopic imperfections from his lapel
now remember this is another kind of business
they dont earn your respect
you owe it to them
dont stare them down but dont look away either
they are fools not to trust you
thats the attitude
im having a stroke
youve come far
youre a good man
i love you
keaton blinks then stammers looking for a response
live with it
she kisses him and runs down the steps with keaton close behind
keaton playfully grabs her ass and she nearly stumbles down the stairs
they come to the bottom of the steps giggling and jabbing each other
once off the stairs they instantly transform as though hit with cold air
they assume a cool professional exterior and walk two feet apart
one would look at them and see only two business associates here to ply their trade
they walk across the dimly lit dining room to a table in the far corner where two men are already waiting
the first is mr
fortier age thirty five the other is mr
renault age sixty
both men are impeccably dressed with a distinguished air
they stand and smile
edie nice to see you
sorry were late
struggling with english you must be mr
dean keaton renaults hand is already out
how do you do
they shake hands
keaton takes fortiers hand next
so nice to finally meet you
everyone sits at the table
all faces are smiling
edies hand reaches out and finds keatons leg
her hand runs high up his inner thigh and squeezes firmly
her face is absolutely calm giving no hint of what her hand is doing
keaton smiles and clears his throat
follow a waiter past the flight of steps
five sets of feet arriving at the bottom
the feet in the middle wear shoes notably nicer than the rest
special agent david kujan pronounced koo yahn u
thirtyish dark haired and determined
edie brought us your proposal and ill be honest
were very impressed
a bit skeptical i must admit but impressed
we find the concept brilliant but new york is difficult for new restaurants
how can we be certain that our money will be returned in the long run
keaton looks at edie and smiles confidently
its simple gentlemen design versatility
a restaurant that can change with taste without losing the overall aesthetic
our atmosphere wont be painted on the walls
this was the part of the proposal that intrigued us but im not sure i follow
lets say for example this i had to see myself
keaton looks up
he sees david kujan
behind him are the very serious looking guys in suits
keaton is not happy to see them
im in a meeting
time for another one
this is my attorney edie finneran
keaton contd this is mr
renault and mr
everyone this is david kujan
special agent kujan
gestures to men behind him these gentlemen are with the new york police department
you look great keaton
better than i would have thought
is there a problem mr
the small matter of a stolen truck load of guns that wound up on a boat to ireland last night
renault and fortiers confusion is giving way to suspicion
if you will excuse us for a moment gentlemen
we need to ask you some questions downtown
youll be quite awhile
renault starts to get up
we should leave you to discuss whatever this is
keaton stands up and throws a wad of money on the table to cover the check
he looks at edie
she moves to stand but he sits her back down with a hand on her shoulder
enjoy the meal
to edie ill call you
kujan takes him by the arm but keaton yanks away
he looks out over the dozens of other faces in the restaurant
everyone is looking at him with some level of surprise
if keaton is humiliated by the whole affair he hides it well
a police officer steps into the frame and opens the steel door
follow a pair of feet as they shuffle across the cement floor
the shoes are shabby and worn as are the wrinkled pants that hang too low and loose at the cuffs
the right foot is turned slightly inward and falls with a hard limp
it is clear that the knee does not extend fully
the sound of a steel door opening
the bottom corner of a steel cage comes into view
another set of feet falls into step with the first
another steel door and another set of feet
another door another and another
five pairs of feet walk single file down the hall
the lame feet are in the front of the line
they come to another steel door this one solid and covered with dents and rivets
roger kint verbal to his few friends
he has a deeply lined face making his thirty odd years a good guess at best
from his twisted left hand we can see that he suffers from a slight but not debilitating palsy
behind him are dean keaton fred fenster mcmanus and todd hockney
t verbal steps through the door followed by the rest
it didnt make sense that i be there
i mean these guys were hard core hijackers but there i was
at that point i wasnt scared f knew i hadnt done anything they could do me for
besides it was fun
i got to make like i was notorious
the five men are ushered into the room in front of a white wall painted with horizontal blue stripes
each has a number at either end to denote the height of the man in front of it
between these lines are thinner blue lines to tell the specific height in inches
bright lights shine on all of them
they squint eyes adjusting
keaton leans forward a bit and looks at the men in line with him
he shares a look of familiarity with fenster and then mcmanus
hockney smiles at all of them
mcmanus to keaton where you been man
shut up in there
alright you all know the drill
when your number is called step forward and repeat the phrase youve been given
the men all nod
hockney takes a step forward
he looks directly into a mirror on the other side of the room
it is three feet square and we can make out faint light behind it
it is a two way
he speaks in a complete dead pan
hand me the keys you fucking cock sucker
mcmanus steps up and makes a gun with his thumb and forefinger
he mocks criminal intensity pointing at the mirror
he camps up his line
mcmanus give me the keys you motherfucking cocksucking pile of shit or ill rip off your knock it off
get back in line
mcmanus steps back
the rest of the men do their bit as verbal speaks
it was bullshit
the whole rap was a setup
everything is the cops fault
you dont put guys like that in a room together
who knows what can happen
mcmanus sits in a chair in front of a white wall
he smiles at someone off screen
this has to be embarrassing for you guys huh
i mean you know and i know this is a load of shit but at least i dont have a captain with his dick in my ass making me play
that has got to suck are you done
mcmanus do you work for a broad
that would have to be the worst
are you done
mcmanus still i guess dignity is a small pries to pay for medical and a pension
a small pension mind you but a pension nonetheless
they drilled us all night
somebody was pissed about that truck getting knocked off and the cops had nothing
they were hoping somebody would slip
give them something to go on
they knew we wouldnt fight it because they knew how to lean on us
theyd been doing it forever
our rights went right out the window
it was a violation
i mean disgraceful
they went after mcmanus first
he was a good guy
a top notch entry man

keaton shows just a flicker of contempt
the threat has hit home
like i said
it was all your mistake
charge me with it and ill beat it
lets get back to the truck
a fist flies into the frame and connects with keatons jaw
his head snaps back blood flowing freely from his mouth
keaton is brought in to a holding where he joins fenster hockney verbal and mcmanus
he sits in a corner and keeps to himself
fenster is in mid tirade
somebody should do something
what is this shit getting hauled in every five minutes
okay so i did a little time does that mean i get railed every time a truck finds its way off the planet
mcmanus is silently staring at keaton who sits on a bench looking away
these guys got no probable cause

verbal looks away from hockney awaiting a violent response
everyone slowly starts to laugh
hockney looks as if he is about to boil in his own skin
to hockney let it go
verbal smiles at keaton appreciatively
mcmanus stands and walks to the toilet in the corner of the cell
he starts taking a leak mcmanus look weve all been put out by this i figure we owe it to ourselves to salvage a little dignity
now fenster and i got wind of a possible job why dont you just calm down what do you care what he says
mcmanus yeah im just talking here and hockney seems to want to hear me out
i know fenster is with me to verbal how about you guy
mcmanus finishes pissing

mcmanus taps the bars of his cell and the others laugh

no youre missing the point
i dont want to hear anything you have to say
i dont want to know about your job
just dont let me hear you
i want nothing to do with any of you beat i beg your pardon but all of you can go to hell
mcmanus dean keaton gone the high road
what is the world coming to
mcmanus and keaton stare at one another for a long and tense moment
finally mcmanus turns to the others
mcmanus contd forget him then
whispering now i cant talk about this here in any detail but listen up
everyone but keaton gravitates toward mcmanuss cell as he begins to speak in low hushed tones
and that was how it began
the five of us brought in on a trumped up charge to be leaned on by half wits
what the cops never figured out and what i know now was that these men would never break never lie down never bend over for anybody
it is morning in the aftermath of the opening scene
harsh sunlight shines on a line of body bags on the dock
police swarm everywhere photographers are taking pictures of the scene while a team of men in rolled up sleeves and plastic gloves pick at the remains
two men on a fire boat operate a water cannon dousing the smoldering remains of a burned out ships hull
watching this from the edge of the pier is a man in a dark suit
he is special agent jack baer of the f
he is tall and fit in his late thirties
he gazes out over the water thoughtfully
a uniform cop trots up to him
who are you
baer holds up his badge without looking at the man
agent jack baer f
how many dead
before the cop can answer baer turns and walks along the line of body bags
fifteen so far
were still pulling some bodies out of the water
baer eyes the corpses on the dock burned beyond recognition
looking for anyone in particular
baer looks at the cop for the first time unamused
f dont want any of the bodies taken away until ive had a chance to go over this understood
i have to clear the scene
ive got word direct from the chief baer lights a cigarette only half listening
unimpressed yes the chief
theres a guy in county hospital but hes in a coma
has the other guy a cripple from new york i think
listen the chief said excuse me
baer walks away from the cop ignoring him completely
he wanders through the carnage on the pier
a half mile out from the pier
the sea is choppy stirred by the wind
an object floats into view a few feet away bobbing in the water
it is a dead body a man face down wearing a checkered bathrobe
he drifts quietly toward the open ocean
verbal kint sits in a chair in front of a microphone attached to a tape recorder his brow beaded with sweat
on the wall behind him is the seal of the state of california he is cleaner better kept in a well cut suit and neatly trimmed hair
he looks older than he did in new york worn down
a flurry of voices banter off screen
verbals eyes follow the voices back and forth
my client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings
in exchange his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible
the district attorneys office will comply provided no provisions nothing
my clients testimony for his immunity
may i be frank counselor
i suspect your political power as much as i respect it
i dont know why mr
kint has so many faceless allies in city hall and i dont care
the embarrassment he helped cause the city of new york will not happen here
counselor i will prosecute your client
i will be very impressed to see if the district attorney manages to bring in twenty seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy
i would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged faceless people in city hall you mention
one would think the counsel is veiling a threat
counsel isnt veiling anything
i take my chances then
i feel safer without a job if a man like mr
kint is behind bars
kint will plead guilty to weapons possession
counselor youre insulting me
counselor youre bluffing
shall i push for misdemeanor two
voices mumble off screen
verbal fidgets in his chair
this is ludicrous
a tiny smile and a genuine look of disbelief flash across verbals face
clearing throat as for the rest of the charges grand larceny arson
murder the district attorney will accept the subjects testimony in connection with the above mentioned events and in exchange will offer complete immunity
the transcript of said testimony will be sealed and all matters incriminating to mr
kint will be rendered inadmissible
verbal lets out a long held sigh of relief
david kujan is walking quickly beside sergeant rabin a dark and weathered looking man in his late thirties
they move up a staircase into the heart of police headquarters
what do you mean i cant see him
came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county
kints lawyer comes in and five minutes later the d
comes out looking like hed been bitch slapped by the boogey man
they took his statement and cut him a deal
did they charge him with anything
whatthe fuck is that
rabin motions for kujan to lower his voice
he points out that they are walking through a bullpen filled with desks where a number of other police are working within earshot
i give the d
credit for getting that much to stick
this whole thing has turned political
the mayor was here the chief the governor called this morning for christs sake
this guy is
rabin contd protected from up on high by the prince of fucking darkness
when does he post bail
two hours tops
i want to see him
rabin comes to an office door with his name on it
he opens it and lets kujan in before following
rabins office can only be described as a disaster area
the desk is cluttered with weeks perhaps months or even years of paperwork that could never conceivably be sorted out
above his desk is a bulletin board
it is a breathtaking catastrophe of papers wanted posters rap sheets memos and post its
this is in the neighborhood of decades
rabin is a man with a system so cryptic so far beyond the comprehension of others he himself is most likely baffled by it
even if i was to let you talk to him he wont talk to you
hes paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired this wont be an interrogation just a
friendly chat to kill time
enunciating he wont go into the interrogation room
someplace else then
kujan looks around rabins messy office
no no no no no
if it was a dope deal wheres the dope if it was a hit who called it in
and i am sure you have a host of wild theories to answer these questions
you know damn well what i think
thats crazy dave and it doesnt matter
he has total immunity and his story checks out
he doesnt know what you want to know
i dont think he does
not exactly but theres a lot more to his story
i want to know why twenty seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety one million dollars worth of dope that wasnt there
above all i want to be sure that dean keaton is dead
just until he makes bail
theyre all dead
no matter how tough you r
say this keaton was no one on that boat couldve made it out alive
a door marked intensive care
the door bursts open
suddenly the hallway is a flurry of activity
doctor lisa plumber age fifty walks quickly beside jack baer walks with all of the determination of a battalion of chinese infantry
doctor ridgly walters a young intern in his late twenties rushes up to them
ridgly this is special agent jack baer from the f
agent baer this is doctor ridgly waiters
nice to meet you
is he talking
he regained consciousness less than an hour ago
he spoke not english then he lapsed
i dont it was hungarian
most of them were hungarians
any fluent hungarians on your staff
we have a turkish audiologist
ridgly opens a door and baer barrels through
baer comes to an abrupt halt at the foot of a bed surrounded by a massive tangle of medical equipment
in the center of it all is the as yet unnamed arkosh kovash mid thirties
his body is nearly mummified in bandages and plaster from waist to chin
kovash s are you the police
i need the police
hell find out im here and hell kill me
i need the police
i will tell them anything they want to know
please i am going to be killed
will he die
theres a chance
baer walks over to rovash and kneels down on the bed beside him
he looks closely at his battered and scalded face
he listens to him far a moment
kovash goes on incessantly
find someone who understands me you idiot im going to be killed youll all be killed if he has to do it
help me god
theyre all stupid
get someone who understands me or were all going to die
baer pulls a cellular phone out of his jacket and dials
call hospital security and put a man on the door until the police get here
why are you just standing there you idiot
im not speaking english am i
wouldnt it make sense to find someone who could talk to me so you could find the person that set me on fire perhaps
he is the devil
youve never seen anyone like keyser soze in all your miserable life you idiot
do you at least understand that
the devil himself
or are you american policemen io stupid that you havent even heard of him
keyser soze you ridiculous man
ridgly runs out of the room
kovash babbles louder and louder trying to get baers attention
baer sticks a finger in one ear to block him out and hear the phone
is he dangerous
someone picks up on the other end of the phone
joel its baer
im down at l
the guy they pulled out of the harbor is arkosh kovash
yes im sure
no hes all fucked up
i cant hear you
to arkosh shut up hugo im on the phone
into phone yes
not until i put someone on him
listen i need you to send me someone who can speak hungarian
hes awake and talking like a thai hooker
how should i know
get me someone who can talk to him baer is suddenly distracted by something kovash has said
in the middle of a long string of unintelligible dialect he has spouted two words that have gotten baers attention
he turns and looks down at the tattered man in the bed
kovash realizes baer is listening and says the two words again
he waves his hand gesturing for kovash to say it again
into phone joel call dan metzheiser over at justice and find dave kujan from customs
rabin walks out of a small room
behind him we catch a glimpse of a workroom with a bench covered with wires
kujan comes out a moment later gently fixing his tie
rabin opens the door to his office and kujan enters
rabin follows looking up and down the hall before closing the door behind them
as the door closes we can just make out the back of verbals head
he is seated in rabins office smoking a cigarette
kujan and rabin sit down across from verbal
exasperated verbal you know were trying to help you
and i appreciate that
and i want to help you agent kujan
i like cops
i would have liked to have been a fed myself but my c
was verbal i know you know something
i know youre not telling us everything
i told the d
everything i know
rabin stands over louis a messy looking technician at his workbench in a room full of electronic equipment
he adjusts several dials on a receiver until the voices of kujan and verbal come clearly through a tinny speaker on the wall
rabin reaches over for a nearby pot of coffee
i know you liked keaton i know you think he was a good man
i know he was good
he was a corrupt cop verbal
fifteen years ago but he was a good thief anyway the cops wouldnt let him go legit
keaton was a piece of shit
you trying to get a rise out of me agent kujan
i just want to hear your story
its right here
he taps a finger on the stack of paper that kujan brought in
kujan picks it up and thumbs through it
according to your statement you are a short con operator
run of the mill seams
everything you do you learned from somebody else
thats been suppressed
anything in there is inadmissible
oh i know
sweet deal you have
laughing well i do have the weapons charge
im looking at six whole months hard time
smiling you know a dealer named ruby deemer verbal
you know a religious guy named john paul
you know ruby is in attica
he didnt have my lawyer
i know ruby
hes very big on respect
likes me very much
verbal sees this getting to something
his smiles fades
now i know your testimony was sealed
ruby is well connected
he still has people running errands for him
what do you think hed say if he found out you dropped his name to the d
theres nothing in there about ruby
i be sure to mention that to him
verbal is not smiling anymore
he stares at kujan with utter contempt knowing he is being shafted
the first thing i learned on the job know what it was
how to spot a murderer
lets say you arrest three guys for the same killing
put them all in jail overnight
the next morning whoever is sleeping is your man
if youre guilty you know youre caught you get some rest let your guard down you follow
i get right to the point
im smarter than you
i find out what i want to know and i get it from you whether you like it or not
im not a rat
kujan puts his hand on the transcript of verbals confession
rabin walks in with a cup of coffee
verbal takes it with his good hand and sips it with a relish
back when i was picking beans in guatemala we used to make fresh coffee
right off the trees i mean
that was good
this is shit but hey
can we get started again
now what happened after the line up
verbal sneers at kujan unable to change the subject
keaton stops at the top of the front steps of the police station and lights a cigarette
edie comes out behind him fuming mad
and the desk sergeant is actually trying to tell me he cant release you
can you believe that
you werent even charged
new york police jesus
i want to take pictures of your face to bring to the d
first thing in the morning
just forget about it
he looks across the street and sees fenster and mcmanus talking by a newsstand
mcmanus is thumbing through magazines
keaton looks to his right and sees hockney trying to hail a cab
i have this thing in front of a grand jury by monday
i dont want to hear this right now
what did renault and fortier say
they want more time to think about investing
they just said they wanted time
time for what edie
time to look into me a little more thats what
no matter how well you cover my tracks now theyll find out who i am
give me some credit
i got you this far lets go to the grand jury
this is never going to stop if we no
its never going to stop period
it wont take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us
just then verbal bumps into him on his way out the door
he excuses himself and hobbles down the steps oblivious to who he has bumped into as he tries to navigate the stairs
dont give up on me now dean
theyll never stop
i love you
to himself they ruined me tonight
dean i love you
do you hear me
verbal gets to the sidewalk and stops
he turns realizing it is keaton on the steps
lets just go to my place
well worry about this tomorrow
keaton and verbal look at one another for a moment
keaton then looks over to the newsstand and sees fenster looking at him
mcmanus notices fenster and glances up from his magazine to see what he is looking at
come home with me please
keaton looks at hockney who has one foot in a cab
he is looking at fenster and mcmanus who are looking at keaton
this makes hockney look up at keaton as well
suddenly edie tunes in to what is going on
she notices the others on the street
she reaches over and takes keaton by the arm pulling gently
she glares at the others
come home dean
verbal looks at everyone else from where he stands on the street
fenster mcmanus and hockney all look at him and then at each other
it is a strange moment of unspoken understanding
all eyes finally turn to keaton high on the front steps of the police station as he walks away with edie
verbal stands in front of an apartment door
he hesitates for a long moment before he knocks
after a moment the door opens and keaton stands on the other side of it
he is wearing a bathrobe and smoking a cigarette
he looks at verbal without any expression whatsoever
what are you doing here
how did you find me
i just asked one of the detectives downtown
he seemed pretty happy to tell me
keaton curses under his breath and motions for verbal to come in
verbal walks in and sits down on the couch watching keaton cautiously
he looks around the large apartment beautifully furnished and decorated
edie walks into the room in a mans button down shirt and sweat pants
dean who was at the she stops when she sees verbal
verbal stands and smiles nervously
how do you do
verb roger this is edie finneran
edie this is roger kint he was at cold i know who he is
i hope i didnt disturb you
i hope so too mr
can i get you something to drink
a glass of water would be nice
edie shoots a look at keaton on her way out of the room
keaton tries to hush his voice despite his anger
what the hell do you want
i wanted to talk to you
the other guys i did you a favor by standing up for you last night but dont think were friends
im sorry but i have other things theyre gonna do a job
three million dollars maybe more
keaton is speechless
verbal sits on the couch again
they sent me to offer you a cut
we could use a fifth man a driver thats all youll do
edie walks in with a glass of ice water and hands it to verbal
verbal drinks slowly
edie stands over him her face blank
it is an awkward moment
she deliberately makes verbal uncomfortable
so what is it you do mr
a hijacker like dean here
or something more creative
thats enough edie
angry i dont know what you came here for but we wont have any part of it
keaton takes edie by the arm and tries to guide her toward the other room
she pulls away anger turning to rage
ive spent the last year of my life putting his back together again i wont have you come in here and what makes you think get out
get out of m home
keaton is pulling her now
she yanks her arm away and shoves him
dont touch me
just dont she turns and walks out of the room
somewhere in the back of the apartment a door slams
keaton turns and glares at verbal
if youll just let me suddenly keaton lunges
he grabs verbal by the lapels and lifts him off the couch moving him effortlessly across the room and slamming him into the wall next to the front door
he opens it
dont hurt me
seething hurt you you sonofabitch
i could kill you
keaton starts to shove verbal out the door
quickly theyre going to hit the taxi service
new yorks finest taxi service
they thats bullshit
they dont operate anymore
mcmanus has a friend in the fourteenth precinct
theyre coming out for one job thursday
theyre picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of south america
fenster and mcmanus have a fence set to take the stuff
some guy in california
his name is redfoot
never heard of him
keaton moves to throw verbal out
verbal grabs keaton and holds tight
you have to come
whats with you
what do you care whether i come or not
they they dont know me
they wont take me unless you go
look at me
i need this
dont tell me you dont need this
is this your place
keaton is unable to answer
theyre never going to stop with us you know that
this way we hit the cops where it hurts and get well in the mean time
keaton lets verbal go and steps back thinking
as clean as you could ever get theyll never let you go now
verbal contd im not knocking you
you look like youve got a good little seam going with this lawyer wham
keaton punches verbal in the stomach and drops him to one knee
verbal coughs and tries to find his breath
you watch your mouth
gasping okay okay
you say its the real thing
keaton reaches for verbal
keaton gently helps him up and guides him to the couch
they bath sit
keaton reaches for a pack of cigarettes and lights one for each of them
verbal takes one and has a few drags catching his breath and rubbing his stomach in pain
i was out of line
i be alright
well im sorry
beat i probably shit blood tonight
verbal thinks about it for a moment and laughs with him
keatons laughter trails off
he thinks for a moment
how are they going to do it
mcmanus wants to go in shooting
i said no way
fenster and hockney
theyre pretty pissed off
theyll do anything
now i got a way to do it without killing anyone but like i said they wont let me in without you
not if we do it my way
lost in thought i swore id live above myself
verbal smiles knowing he has him
new yorks finest taxi service was not your normal taxi service
it was a ring of corrupt cops in the n
that ran a high profit racket driving smugglers and drug dealers all over the city
for a few hundred dollars a mile you got your own black and white and a police escort
they even had their own business cards
oscar whitehead a tall gray haired man in his fifties comes out of the international terminal in a white linen suit
he holds a large suitcase in his right hand
after a while somebody started asking questions and the taxi service shut down
ever since then internal affairs had been waiting to catch them in the act
oscar stands on the curb long enough to light a cigarette
after a moment a police cruiser pulls up to him
he opens the back door and gets in
and that was how we started
mcmanus came to us with the job fenster got the vans hockney supplied the hardware i came through with how to do it so no one got killed but keaton
keaton put on the finishing touch
a little fuck you from the five of us to the n
the car drives out of the airport
a van follows at a distance
sergeant jim strausz a meaty imposing looking man in his forties drives the car
beside him is a thin greasy looking patrolman steve rizzi
they are two drivers for new yorks finest taxi service
how was the flight
oscar hands rizzi a thick envelope
will that get me to the pierre
rizzi counts the stack of hundred dollar bills in the envelope
thatll get you to cape god
the two men laugh
strausz watches the road expressionless
the cruiser heads towards the heart of manhattan
the police car makes its way down a wide abandoned street
a white minivan pulls out behind it and heads the same way
strausz looks in the rear view mirror
the white minivan is flashing his high beams
what the strausz looks in front of him
a green minivan swerves in front of them from out of nowhere
strausz slams on the brakes and skids to a halt
the white minivan rams them from behind
strausz and rizzi are stunned for a moment as two more vans screech up on either side of the cruiser boxing it in with only a few inches between them
the cruiser is surrounded on all sides
suddenly shotgun barrels come through the open windows
they come to rest one on strauszs left temple one on rizzis right
rizzi looks out of the corner of his eye
he sees the driver of the van next to him holding the shotgun with one hand
a stocking is over the drivers head
strausz looks straight ahead
the minivan in front of them is missing a back window
another man with a stocking on his head aims a sub machine gun at them from inside
by the twisted right hand holding the front of the gun we know it is verbal
strausz and rizzi raise their hands without being asked
the driver of the white van gets out with a gallon jug in one hand and a sledge hammer in the other
moving like lightning he jumps onto the roof of the police car
he stands on the front of the roof and swings the hammer down
the hammer punches three huge holes in the windshield and finally caves it in
strausz and rizzi are covered with pebbles of broken glass
whitehead clutches his bag in the back seat
he trembles in terror
the man standing on the roof doubles over and sticks a gun in strauszs face
his face hangs upside down and looks gruesome covered from the mouth up in a stocking
by the voice we know it is mcmanus
mcmanus give it up
oscar hands the suitcase up front and strausz passes it to mcmanus
through the front windshield of the front van we see keaton at the wheel
verbal is behind him leaning out the back window
beneath keatons stocking mask we see he is trembling and sweating sickened by what he is doing
he glances up at the rear view mirror and looks at the scene outside
he looks down at the floor in shame shaking his head
mcmanus the money
strausz looks at rizzi
mcmamjs contd rizzi hands the money through the remains of the windshield
mcmanus takes the money and stuffs it in his jacket
he steps back and takes the cap off of the gallon jug
he quickly pours some kind of liquid all over the roof of the car
do you know who i am
a hand reaches into the drivers side window and rips strauszs badge off of his shirt
strausz dares to turn his head right at the shotgun pointing at him through the window
on the other end is a masked and smiling todd hockney
we db now jerk off
mcmanus lights a pack of matches and drops them on the roof of the car as he jumps off
the liquid ignites the roof of the car is instantly in flames
strausz and rizzi attempt to bail out but the vans are too close for them to open the doors
the vans pull away
strausz and rizzi escape from the car
oscar is trapped inside screaming
strausz and rizzi stop each expecting the other to go let oscar out
the scene is swarming with fresh police cars
strausz and rizzi are fielding questions from a dozen other cops
photographers are everywhere
the papers got keatons call that day and were on the scene before the cops were
strausz and rizzi were indicted three days later
within a few weeks fifty more cops went down with them
it was beautiful
everybody got it right in the ass from the chief on down
hockney fenster mcmanus and verbal are all laughing in a secluded garage
they are still in their black clothes from the robbery
hockney is throwing everyone a can of beer
keaton sits off by himself
he watches the others unable to join in the festivities
the others sit around a cheap card table
it is covered with emeralds
dozens of them
everyone is in awe
mcmanus theres more than i thought
when does the fence come
he never comes to see me
i have to go see him
itll take a few days
me and fenster hold the fuckin phone
you and fenster
no no no
mcmanus guys come on
im sure you can understand my hesitation
then who goes
we all go
how about it keaton
all eyes turn to keaton
he comes out of his trance
we need to lay low for a while
mcmanus fine with me
everyone looks at each other their moment of distrust blowing over
all eyes drift back to the emeralds on the table
hockney begins to snicker then mcmanus then fenster
verbal joins in at last
mcmanus grabs verbal and hugs him shaking him violently
mcmanus contd my boy with the plan
suddenly everyone yells and pours beer over verbals head
he laughs as he is drenched in white foam nearly choking as the others chant his name
keaton watches from across the room trying to smile in vain
keaton and verbal sit side by side on a sofa
a sign on the door behind them reads montgomery and laguardia attorneys were going to miss the flight
well make it
dont do this
send her a card something
well make it
finneran will be with you in a moment
keaton stands and paces across the waiting room
he comes to a set of glass doors and looks through them
keaton realizes he is standing on a balcony overlooking a library below
he sees edie working in the library with an old woman
the two women talk for a moment
suddenly keaton turns with a start
verbal is standing behind him
were gonna miss the plane
beat shell understand
edie is smiling and laughing with the old woman
keatons face is marked with guilt and anguish
keaton turns and walks out of the waiting room
verbal takes one last glance at edie and turns back to keaton
edie seems to sense something behind her
she turns and looks through the glass doors and up into the waiting room
nothing is there
she goes back to chatting with the old woman
really i feel weepy
you wanted to know what happened after the line up im telling you
oh come on verbal
who do you think youre talking to
you really expect me to believe he retired
for a woman
he was using her
he loved her
and im supposed to believe that hitting the taxi service wasnt his idea either
that was all fenster and mcmanus
keaton was a cop for four years
who else would know the taxi service
kujan contd better
that job had his name all over it
you keep trying to lay this whole ride on t keaton
it wasnt like that
sure he knew but edie had him all turned around
r im telling you straight i swear
let me tell you something
i know dean keaton
ive been investigating him for three years
the guy i know is a cold blooded bastard
indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force so dont sell me the hooker with the heart of gold
you got him wrong
keaton was under indictment a total of seven times when he was on the force
in every case witnesses either reversed their testimony to the grand jury or died before they could testify
when they t finally did nail him for fraud he spent five years in sing sing
he killed three prisoners inside one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death
of course i cant prove this but i cant prove the best part either
kujan pauses to drink some coffee
dean keaton was dead
did you know that
r he died in a fire two years ago during an investigation into the murder of a witness who was going to testify against him
two people saw keaton enter a warehouse he owned just before it went up
they said he had gone in to check a leaking gas main
it blew up and took all of dean keaton with it
within three months of the explosion the two witnesses were dead one killed himself in his car and the other fell down an open elevator shaft
rabin and louis look at one another as they listen
kujan on speaker six weeks ago i get an anonymous call telling me i can find keaton eating at mondinos with his lawyer and there he is
now because he never profited from his alleged death and because someone else was convicted for the murder we tried to pin on keaton we had to let him go
he was dead just long enough for a murder rap to blow over then he had lunch
i dont know about that
i dont think you do
but you say you saw keaton die
i think youre covering his ass and hes still out there somewhere
i think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor
my bet is hes using you because youre stupid and you think hes your friend
you tell me hes dead so be it
i want to make sure hes dead before i go back to new york
blurting he wasnt behind anything
it was the lawyer
what lawyer verbal
verbal stammers for a moment looking around wildly
back when i was in that barber shop quartet in skokie illinois i used to have kujan grabs verbals shirt and yanks him half out of his seat
you think i dont know you held out on the d
what did you leave out of that testimony
i can be on the phone to ruby deemer in ten minutes
gave me immunity
no immunity from me
you atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind
every criminal i have put in prison
kujan contd every cop who owes me a favor every creeping scumbag that works the street for a living will know the name of verbal kint
youll be the lowest sort of rat the prince of snitches the loudest cooing stool pigeon that ever grabbed his ankles for the man
now you talk to me or that precious immunity theyve seen so fit to grant you wont be worth the paper the contract put out on your life is printed
verbal looks at kujan with utter contempt
there was a lawyer
is he the one that killed keaton
but im sure keatons dead
tell me every last detail
kovashs room is now filled with people
jack baer stands next to daniel metzheiser a balding man in his forties
next to him is doctor plumber
across from her is ridgly waiters
sitting beside the bed is tracy fitzgerald a casually dressed woman in her late twenties
she holds a x inch drawing pad on her lap
police fill the hall

baer grabs metzheiser by the arm
to bodi tell him to tell this man what he was telling me before
who is the devil
who did he see
who is this devil you keep talking about
keyser soze he was in the harbor shooting everyone in sight
metzheiser is suddenly interested
he says he saw him in the harbor
he was shooting

he saw keyser soze he says he saw him in the harbor
he was shooting
killing many men

he says he knows his face
he sees it when he closes his eyes
ask him what this devil looks like
to tracy ready
tracy holds up her pad and pencil
mcmanus fence was this guy named redfoot
he had a good reputation around l
seemed like a good guy looked like a cowhide full of thumbtacks
all five guys stand in a group
it is utterly quiet
an old but well kept cadillac creeps into the lot from the far end and idles up to them
the windows are tinted too much to see in
the car passes within a few feet of them and drives on
a moment later a chrome and leather monster of a harley davidson pulls into the lot
the rider is dressed in an almost comical array of leather silver and suede
he waves to the caddy as it parks a few yards from keaton and the others
it sits quietly almost menacing
as he gets closer we can see he is wearing one black boot and one red
keaton is still looking at them when the bike pulls up to them and stops
redfoot and mcmanus shake hands
howve you been
hows it going fenster
you got it
mcmanus holds up a briefcase
redfoot takes it and gets off the bike
he walks over to the caddy
the door of the caddy opens
redfoot hands the case to someone inside that we cannot see
the door closes
whispering snazzy dresser this guy
a moment later the door of the caddy opens again
someone hands redfoot a different briefcase and he walks back over to mcmanus
he hands him the case
mcmanus hands the case back to hockney
hockney opens it revealing the stacks of money inside
you must be keaton
mcmanus jesus im sorry
redfoot this is dean keaton thats todd hockney and thats verbal kint
to verbal the man with the plan
are you guys interested in more work
mcmanus moves to answer but keaton cuts him off
were on vacation
ive got a ton of work and no good people
mcmanus whats the job
keaton shoots mcmanus a foul look
mcmanus pretends not to notice
a jeweler out of texas named saul
he rents a suite at a hotel downtown and does free appraisals
buys whatever he can
word is he moves with a lot of cash
i take the merchandise you keep the green
mcmanus give us time to check it out
id expect nothing less
mcmanus well call you
take your time
a friend of mine in new york tells me you knew spook hollis
i hear you did time with old spook
yeah he was a good egg
i used to run a lot of dope for him
fuckin shame he got shivved
i shivved him
now mcmanus is shooting the angry look at keaton
better you hear it from me now than somebody else later
business or personal
a little of both
aint it a crime
call if youre interested
redfoot fires up his bike and takes off with the caddy close behind
mcmanus to keaton whats your fucking problem
one job that was the deal
mcmanus take it as it comes brother
this is bullshit
mcmanus laughs and walks away
fenster and hockney follow
verbal turns to keaton
what is it keaton
distant something i dont know
shaking himself i ever tell you about the restaurant i wanted to open
keaton walks off
verbal follows him in confusion
was good for about two hours
we were from new york
theres no place to eat after one you cant get a pizza that doesnt taste like a fried fruit bat and the broads dont want to know you if you
dont look like a broad
within a few days the last of us was ready to go back to n
but keaton wouldnt have it so he really didnt have a choice
we went to work
mcmanus walks along a line of cars
he comes across a black mercedes and stops
he looks down at the license plate and walks over to the next car a green honda
he pulls a slim jim out of his jacket and pops the lock an the honda
he reaches in and opens the hood
he walks around and sticks his head in the engine
verbal sits behind the wheel
keaton is beside him
hockney and fenster are in the back
they all watch mcmanus from where they are parked a few dozen yards away
the elevator bell sounds at the far end of the garage
the doors open
two men in ill fitting suits get out and look around cautiously
the first is tucci a big bellied white haired menace
the other is higham lean and bad skinned
they are bodyguards and give it away by their every careful move
they turn back to the elevator and motion to someone inside
out walks saul berg a slightly overweight man in his forties with an open collar silk shirt and a thick gold chain on his hairy chest
he carries a large aluminum briefcase
he lets his guards do the worrying
he walks straight to his car
saul passes mcmanus under the hood of the honda
he takes out his keys and pushes a button on his key chain
the mercedes beeps three times and tells saul his alarm is off
tucci keeps an eye on mcmanus
higham watches saul
mcmanus pretends to tinker with the cars engine
he has put a pistol just inside the grill and keeps it within reach
the van on the other side of the garage starts and pulls out of the spot
it cruises over toward the mercedes
tucci sees the van
he and higham are suddenly busy trying to keep track
they hear laughing behind them and turn around
fenster and hockney are walking towards them
they are sporting mustaches and sunglasses in addition to matching suits each with loud plaid sport coats decades out of style
saul glances at tucci and higham
just get in the car saul
under the hood of the honda and out of sight mcmanus pulls on a black ski mask
the van gets closer
i get out of the car and man if the thing wasnt wrecked
and i see this broad in the back seat with nothing on
saul gets in the car quickly but calmly as fenster and hockney laugh and talk louder
they look drunk the desired effect
im laughing so hard i cant breathe tucci and higham try to take it all in stride
sauls reverse lights come on and he begins to back out of the spot
and the fat guy comes out of the car with his pants on backwards and says suddenly the van revs and screeches to a halt behind sauls mercedes blocking him
hockney and fenster drop the drunk act and snap to
they both pull out guns and start screaming
mcmanus comes up from under the hood
tucci and higham throw their hands in the air
hockney and fenster grab them and reach into their belts to get their guns
keaton jumps out of the van and runs up to sauls car his face covered in a ski mask
he yanks on the door handle but it is locked
saul sits in terror behind the wheel
keaton pulls out a pistol and smashes the window with it
give me the case
saul reaches over for the case
keaton trains the gun on him
suddenly saul comes up with a pistol and points it at keaton
keaton sidesteps and grabs his wrist
the gun goes off into the fender of the honda
hockney and fenster both look over at the sound of the gun
tucci and higham seize the opportunity
tucci grabs hockney higham grabs fenster
the four men grapple for the guns
fensters gun falls to the floor
mcmanus picks it up
he trains a pistol on each bodyguard and takes a breath
they are some ten feet apart and moving erratically
hockney and fenster constantly fall in the line of fire
mcmanus walks around the four men keeping a pistol trained on each of the guards
finally he comes to an angle where they are all in front of him
one guard is a few feet away the other is ten feet past him
the closer of the two moves in and out of the sights of the pistol in mcmanus right hand the one farther away does the same with the left
verbal gets out of the van and moves towards them to help
both of mcmanus guns go off like one shot
tucci and higham collapse each with a bullet in his head the only sound is saul grappling with keaton for the gun
his arm is halfway out the window
his elbow rests in the door frame
keaton cannot get the gun out of his hand
finally he pushes down with all his weight
sauls elbow breaks backwards on the door frame
he screams in agony
the gun falls from his hand
all five of the men look at each other for an impossibly long moment
the confusion is only aggravated by sauls screaming
slowly keaton raises his pistol and aims it at saul
his hand trembles his eyes squint to near slits
his finger tenses and slacks off over and over again on the trigger
verbal shoots saul
keaton looks at him in surprise
verbal trembles more than he does
the garage is silent
what the hell
mcmanus bad day
the elevator light comes on
all five men look
keaton reaches into the car and grabs sauls case
everyone else piles into the van
keaton gets in as verbal is driving for the exit
the mood in the van is grim
everyone is silent
keaton pops the clasps on the case and opens it
son of a bitch
everyone looks in the case
it is filled with cash on one side
the other side is filled with clear plastic bags of keaton and the others stand in silhouette in front of the lights of an oncoming car in the distance
we can make out mcmanus loading a gun
what are you doing
mcmanus what does it look like
im going to kill him
we did it your way
now i deal with him
you gonna kill him
im going to deal with him
the car redfoots escort caddy is now in front of them
the horn lets out three short blasts
redfoot comes around from behind the caddy on his motorcycle
he gets off the bike trying to hide a faint smile
mcmanus throws sauls case on the ground in front of him
mcmanus what the fuck is this redfoot
get a grip
i didnt know
you didnt know
the job got thrown to me by this lawyer
who is he
hes a middle man for somebody
he doesnt say and i dont ask
we want to meet him
he wants to meet you
he called last night and asked me to set it up
what do i tell him tell him well meet
mcmanus if youre lying redfoot
mcmanus youre a real bad ass but get off my tip
mcmanus lunges for redfoot
the caddy doors instantly pop open and rifle barrels come into view from within
fenster and hockney draw guns and aim at the caddy
keaton and verbal grab mcmanus and hold him back
redfoot gets on his harley smiling defiantly
real shame about saul getting whacked
lots of cops looking for the guys that did it
im sure theyll get around to asking me
he starts his bike
mcmanus fuck you
redfoot drives off
the caddy waits until he is completely out of sight before following
so this lawyer
came from redfoot
and why leave this out when you talked to the d
rabin sticks his head in
someone to see you agent kujan
kujan steps out into the hall shutting the door behind him
kujan smiles instantly recognizing the man standing with rabin
what are you doing here
ive been looking all over for you
you still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor
you can stop looking
there was no coke
ive been in l
county with a guy they
baer contd pulled out of a drainpipe in san pedro yesterday after the shoot out
he came to this morning and started talking
he was part of a hungarian mob there to do a deal with a bunch of goats from argentina
he says it was definitely not a dope deal
there was ninety one million we know but our man says no way on the dope
this hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for turkey the next day
they had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it
what was the money for
he didnt know
no one doing the deal knew except a few key people
this guy says they were real hush about it
whatever it was it was highly sensitive
i dont get it
they tell me you got the cripple from new york in there
he mention keyser soze who
bear with me here
boom the door bursts open
who is keyser soze verbal looks up in shock
he drops his cigarette and trembles at the mere mention of the name
keaton stands while the rest sit and listen
so i need to know if anyone can think of anybody
somebody with power
enough to possibly track us from new york
weve been over it for an hour now
i say we pack up and run
lets go back to new york
at least get out of l
suddenly the sound of a man clearing his throat
everyone turns to the door behind them
kobayashi a tall slim well groomed man stands in the hall
he has a briefcase in his hand
he smiles politely
keaton stands back and lets him in
kobayashi looks them over
i am mr
ive been asked by my employer to bring a proposal to you gentlemen
that must be mr
i recognize mr
fenster from his mug shot as well as mr
to verbal i can only assume that you are mr
i believe you were the one who disposed of saul
my employer sends his gratitude
a most unexpected benefit
everyone looks at one another in shock that he would know this
what can we do for you
my employer requires your services
one days work
i dont expect all of you to live but those who do will have ninety one million dollars to divide any way they see fit
whos your boss
my employer wishes to remain anonymous
dont jerk me off
we all know what this is
you dont work with me if i work with you without knowing who im working for
now lets cut the shit
whos the man
i work for keyser sate
a strange look crosses keatons face
skepticism mockery and just a hint of fear
hockney mcmanus and fenster all share similar looks
what is this
whos keyser soze
i am sure youve heard a number of tall tales myths and legends about mr
soze i can assure you gentlemen most of them are true
whos keyser soze
judging by the sudden change in mood i am sure the rest of your associates can tell you mr
i have come with an offer directly from mr
an order actually
in nineteen eighty one mr
keaton you participated in the hijacking of a truck in buffalo new york
the cargo was raw steel
steel that belonged to mr
soze and was destined for pakistan to be used in a nuclear reactor
a very profitable violation of u
you had no way of knowing this because the man shipping the steel was working for mr
sate without his knowledge
fenster and mr
mcmanus hijacked a twin prop cargo flight earlier this year out of newark airport
the plane was carrying platinum and gold wiring
also set for pakistan
kobayashi turns and points at hockney
two months ago mr
hockney stole a truck carrying gun parts through queens everyone looks at hockney
he smiles shyly
it occurs to them all that he robbed the truck for which they were all arrested in the first place
guns allegedly set to be destroyed by the state of new york
they were to be lost in a weigh station and routed to belfast
sate using pawns who had no knowledge
turning to verbal which brings us to mr
verbal crumbles under his stare
nine months ago one of mr
soze less than intelligent couriers was taken in a complicated confidence seam by a cripple
he was relieved of sixty two thousand dollars
now to all of them it has taken us some time to find you
our intention was to approach you after your apprehension in new york
you set up the line up
soze made a few calls yes
you were not to be released until i came to see you
it seems mr
keatons attorney ms
finneran was a bit too effective in expediting his release
holding the rest of you became a moot point
what about redfoot
redfoot knew nothing
soze rarely t works with the same people for very long and they never know who theyre working for
one cannot be betrayed if one has no people
so why tell us
because you have stolen from mr
that you did not know you stole from him is the only reason you are still alive but he feels you owe him
you will repay your debt
who is this guy
how do we know you work for soze i dont think that is relevant mr
the five of you are responsible for the murder of saul berg and his bodyguards
redfoot can attest to your involvement and we can see to it that he will
he is not of your superior breed
this is a load of shit
the offer is this gentlemen
sozes primary interest as i am sure you all know is narcotics
hes been competing shall we say with a group of
kobayashi contd argentinians for several years
competing with mr
soze has taken its toll
these argentinians are negotiating the sale of ninety one million dollars in cocaine in three days time
needless to say this purchase will revitalize the diminishing strength of their organization
soze wants you to stop the deal
if you choose you may wait until the buy
whatever money changes hands is yours
the transaction will take place on a boat in san pedro
soze wants you to get to the boat and destroy the cocaine on board
then you are free of your obligation to mr
give me one good reason why i shouldnt kill you right now
kobayashi smiles and puts his briefcase on the table in front of him
a gift from mr
he turns and walks out of the room
keaton walks over to the case and opens it
he reaches in and pulls out five thick manila envelopes each marked in bold black letters
keaton mcmanus hockney fenster and keaton pulls out the files revealing a map underneath
keaton hands each man his file
he opens his first
he pulls out a thick stack of papers and thumbs through them
all of the men open their files
inside are mug shots of each man in his respective file as well as a printout of his criminal record
but there is more
they know everything
mcmanus this is my life in here
everything ive done since i was eighteen
everybody i ever worked with did time with
they fucking know everything
keaton pulls out a large black and white photograph of himself and his lawyer edie finneran
they are laughing arm in arm by a fountain in new york
he hides the photo from the others
this is not right
i dont know
who was that guy that used to talk about soze in new york
mcmanus bricks marlin
he said he did jobs for him
always five times more money than the job was worth
the guy is a pipe dream
this kobayashi is using him for window dressing
i dont know
this is bad
this guy could be l
i think its a setup
the way i hear it soze is some kind of butcher
there is no keyser soze verbal thumbs through his file
a long list of names numbers addresses
it is a detailed portfolio of his entire criminal and personal life
he looks up at keaton
who is keyser soze kujan leans into verbals face
he hangs on his every word
he is supposed to be turkish
some say r his father was german
nobody believed he was real
nobody ever saw him or knew anybody that ever worked directly for him but to hear kobayashi tell it anybody could have worked for soze
you never knew
that was his power
the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didnt exist
one story the guys told me the story i believe was from his days in turkey
there was a petty gang of hungarians that wanted their own mob
they realized that to be in power you didnt need guns or money or even numbers
you just needed the will to do what the other guy wouldnt
after a while they come to power and then they come after soze he was small time then just running dope they say
three of the hungarians come bursting into keyser sozes home
they grab his five children and round them up in the front room
one of the men grabs his wife and back hands her across the face
they come to his home in the afternoon looking for his business
they find his wife and kids in the house and decide to wait for sate
the front door opens and in walks keyser sate
we are never t allowed to see his face
sates wife lies in the corner beaten and bruised
her dress is tattered to shreds
she cannot look up at her husband
the three hungarians stand to greet him
two hold guns in their hands
the third holds a straight razor
he grabs soze youngest boy and holds the razor to his throat
he comes home to his wife raped and his children screaming
the hungarians knew soze was tough
not to be trifled with
so they let him know they meant business
the hungarian smiles
sozes wife screams in horror
the hungarian holds up a blood soaked razor
suddenly he grabs another child
a little girl no older than six
they tell soze they want his territory all his business
soze looks over the faces of his family
then he showed these men of will what will really was
suddenly soze pulls out a pistol and shoots the two men with guns
he turns and aims at the third man holding his child
the man threatens to cut the childs throat slicing just enough to draw blood
the stunned hungarian watches the child fall from his arms
sate turns the pistol on the next child then the next and the next
he kills his children one by one in front of the hungarian
he tells him he would rather see his family dead than live another day after this
soze walks over to his wife crying and beaten on the floor and holds up her head
she gives him the strangest look
one of trust perhaps saturated with fear and humiliation
he puts the gun between her eyes and fires
he lets the last hungarian go and he goes running
he waits until his wife and kids are in the ground and he goes after the rest of the mob
he kills their kids he kills their wives he kills their parents and their parents friends
a dark and looming figure of a man walks in front of a wall of fire a black shadow blurred by waves of heat
he burns down the houses they live in and the stores they work in he kills people that owe them money
and like that he was gone
no one has ever seen him again
he becomes a myth a spook story that criminals tell their kids at night
if you rat on your pop keyser sate will get you
and nobody really ever believes
do you believe in him verbal
keaton always said i dont believe in god but im afraid of him
well i believe in god and the only thing that scares me is keyser soze
jack baer and rabin listen to verbal on the speaker with one ear
you give this any weight agent baer
i can introduce you to dan metzheiser from justice
he has a file on sate in d
its been a hobby of his for a few years
a lot of guys equate him to that reporter on the incredible hulk
had you heard of him before
on the street
a few times
somebody was working for a guy who was working for a guy who got money through keyser soze
that kind of shit
could be an old badge
a hex sign to keep people from fucking with you back when a name meant something
but youre here
i got a guy trying to walk out of the hospital on d fried drumstick to get away from soze
i run it up the flagpole
i came clean
i told it like it happened on the boat
so what if i left out how i got there
its got so many holes in it the d
wouldve told me to blow amnesty out my ass
so you got what you wanted out of me
big fucking deal
and this is why you never told the d
you tell me agent kujan
if i told you the loch ness monster hired me to hit the harbor what would you say
turn states evidence
take the stand on this and well hear it out
ive got immunity now
what can you possibly offer me
if there is a keyser soze hell be looking for you
wheres your head agent kujan
where do you think the pressures coming from
keyser soze or whatever you want to call him knows where i am right now
hes got the front burner under your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later
immunity was just to deal with you assholes
i got a whole new problem when i post bail
so why play into his hands
we can protect you
gee thanks dave
bang up job so far
youll pardon me if i ask you to kiss my pucker
the same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me theyll bail me out
you think you can catch keyser soze
you think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out
if he comes up for anything it will be to get rid of me
beat after that my guess is youll never hear from him again
doctor plumber watches from out in the hall
kovash spits out a constant river of hungarian while bodi tries to keep up relaying everything to tracy fitzgerald
she sketches frantically while daniel metzheiser looks on
the composite sketch of keyser soze is taking form
denotes liners spoken in hungarian
bodi c what sort of nose did he have
it was smaller than that
to tracy the nose is sharper
to arkosh in hung
and what about the hair
you said something earlier about it
it is longer than that
and not so dark
are you sure
dont be stupid
to tracy he says the hair is longer and lighter
waves pound across a stone jetty
a man sits fishing while his young son brando strolls toward the open sea
he pokes at rocks and seaweed with a fishing pole
he glances down at something wedged between the rocks beneath his feet
he pokes at it
he notes the checkered pattern of the fabric entwined with the twisted mess
it is the bloated carcass of the man in the checkered bathrobe
brando pokes its eye with the fishing pole
that was how i ended up in a barber shop quartet in skokie illinois
this is totally irrelevant
oh but its not
if i hadnt been nailed in illinois for running a three card monte in between sets i never would have took off for new york
i never would have met keaton see
that barber shop quartet was the reason for everything
can we just get back to kobayashi
the quartet is part of the bit about kobayashi
the quartet was in my file along with every other thing i had done since high school see
aliases middle men
they knew me better than i did
they knew all of us
kujan looks at his watch
youre stalling verbal
give a guy a break huh
verbal slumps a bit
he realizes his stalling tactic has failed
we woke up the next morning and fenster was gone
he couldnt handle the idea of slumming for soze
he left a note wishing us good luck and took a chunk of the money wed scraped together
mcmanus was furious
he was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit
that night we got the call
kobayashi told us where we could find fenster
keaton looks out over the ocean and smokes a cigarette
what do you want to do with him
mcmanus kneels in the sand
hockney and verbal stand behind him staring at something in front of them
it is the body of fred fenster literally peppered with bullet holes
mcmanus stares at him fighting any flicker of emotion
mcmamjs i worked five years with fenster
more jobs more money than i can count
im sorry mcmanus
mcmanus i want to bury him
mcmanus springs to his feet and points a pistol at keaton
keaton turns to face him and raises his head
mcmanus might as well be pointing a feather duster
mcmanus you will find time
youre not the only one with debts man
mcmanus everyone digs in the sand on the deserted beach with their hands
they are up to their waists in the hole they have scooped out
fensters body is a few feet away
this is nuts
this is fucking dry sand man
when he rots the surfersll smell him from a hundred yards out
mcmanus hockney can see that mcmanus has truly gone over the edge for now
keaton gives him a look that says dont argue
keaton we gotta go
theyre gonna find him
what are we gonna do
i can run
i got no problem with that
they dont seem to have a problem with it either
mcmanus nobody runs
this aint my boy were burying
i dont owe anybody
mcmanus we got a deal here
mcmanus since tonight
mcmanijs its payback
its not payback
i dont answer to you
you want payback
you want to run
i dont care
im going to finish this thing
not for fenster not for anybody else but for me
this kobayashi cocksucker isnt going to stand over me
beat all of you can go to hell
keaton turns and digs furiously with both hands
hockney takes a moment and slowly starts to do the same
the four men dig for fenster
the first to find some rest
verbal smokes with his good hand shaking badly
and after they killed fenster nobody would run
i wanted to
i thought we could make it
why didnt you say anything
i tried believe me but keaton wouldnt have it
it was too far fetched for him
keaton was a grounded guy
an ex cop
to a cop the explanation is never that complicated
its always simple
verbal contd no mystery on the street no arch criminal behind it all
if you got a dead guy and you think his brother did it youre going to find out youre right
nobody argued with keaton
they just set their minds on whacking kobayashi
redfoots harley rests on the roof of the caddy in a mangled heap
the body of the caddy is riddled with bullet holes
redfoots dead body has been shoved head first through a hole in the windshield up to his waist recognizable only by the trademark red boot
kobayashi walks through the front door of a plush office tower followed by two bodyguards
he heads toward the elevator failing to notice hockney a few feet away reading a newspaper
we see a wire running from hockneys ear to his collar
hes coming up
keaton mcmanus and verbal stand by the six elevators on the fortieth floor
they are all wearing khaki overalls and tool belts with walkie talkies
they look like servicemen
all of the elevators have been propped open and stranded
mcmanus moves into one of the elevators
as the doors close i behind him he scrambles for the ceiling hatch
f keaton and verbal listen for anything on the radio
the elevator opens
kobayashi and his bodyguards get on the elevator
the elevator is empty except for the three men
mcmanus has vanished
kobayashi presses a button and they are on the way
suddenly the ceiling hatch opens and mcmanus arm comes out
two shots from a suppressed pistol and the guards drop to the floor dead
kobayashi looks up with surprising calm into mcmanus barrel
mcmanus press forty
the elevator opens and kobayashi is greeted by keaton and verbal
mcmanus drops from the ceiling hatch and pushes him out
verbal and mcmanus grab the dead bodies and drag them out of the elevator
they drag them to the next elevator which has been forced open revealing an empty shaft
the answer is no
soze will be most listen to me cocksucker
there is no keyser sate
if you say his name again i kill you right here
a strange threat
i can only assume youre here to kill me anyway
pity about mr
mcmanus fair trade for fenster
the elevator opens and hockney steps out
do join us
we know you can get to us and now you know we can get to you
im offering you the chance to call this off
so my employer has made up his mind
he does not change it
neither do we
mcmanus you got fenster you may get more but you wont get us all
not before one of us gets to you
i believe you mr
i quite sincerely do
you would not have been chosen if you were not so capable but i cannot make this decision
whatever you can threaten me with is
ludicrous in comparison to what will be done to me if
mcmanus just so you know
im the guy
im the one thats gonna get through to you
i am sorry mr
to keaton f implore you to believe me mr
soze is very real and very determined
mcmanus holds a pistol to kobayashis chin
the lawyers cool eyes never falter
before you do me in you will let me finish my business with ms
finneran first wont you
suddenly keaton grabs mcmanus hand and pulls the gun away before he can shoot
what did you say
she is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition
i requested she be put on the case personally
she flew out yesterday
everyone looks at keaton
kill away mr
everyone follows kobayashi quietly down a dimly lit oak lined hallway
verbal holds a small pistol discreetly in the small of kobayashis back
they come to a glass office foyer
kobayashi gestures and everyone looks through the glass into the lobby beyond
edie finneran is talking casually with the receptionist
edie glances toward the men in the hall
keaton turns quickly on his heels facing the others
from where edie stands it looks as though kobayashi is talking to a group of harmless maintenance men
they see a large man dressed very much like the two dead bodies left in the hall downstairs
the man notices kobayashi and the others
he stands and stares menacingly
finnerans escort in los angeles
never leaves her for a moment
i thought youd like to know she was in good hands
keatons mind races for an alternative
he can find none
verbal lowers his gun without being told
get your rest gentlemen
the boat will be ready for you on friday
if i see you or your friends before then or fail to check in every half hour with that unpleasant looking man in there ms
finneran will find herself the victim of a gruesome violation before she dies
as will your father mr
and your uncle randall in arizona mr
i might only castrate mr
mcmanus nephew david
do i make myself clear
all of the men surround kobayashi aching to kill him
i take care of the dead men downstairs
well add them to the cost of mr
now if youll excuse me
kobayashi walks into the office
edie turns to greet him
keaton slowly turns and watches as they shake hands and talk
kobayashi says something they cannot hear and edie laughs her back to the window
kobayashi smiles over her shoulder at keaton
all the while the bodyguard watches keaton
he nods politely before keaton and the others leave
verbal watches for a moment more and follows
keaton verbal hockney and mcmanus sit in a rented sedan overlooking san pedro harbor
another file from kobayashis briefcase is laid out on the dashboard
this has a map and a good fifty pages of information in it
its a logistical nightmare
close quarters no advance layout ten men maybe twenty
can we stealth these guys
with all that coke theyll be ready which brings me to sunny spot number two
even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat we get nothing
mcmanus and if we wait for the money
ten more men at least
in my opinion it cant be done
anyone who walks into this wont come out alive
mcmanus im for waiting for the money
did you hear what he just said
if im going in i want a stake
mcmanus so do i
verbal is shocked by what he is hearing
he looks at keaton as if to ask him for his decision
keatons cold stare is all the answer verbal needs
he slumps in his seat resigned to the others
i just cant believe were just gonna walk into certain death
they all suddenly realize the weight of their situation
mcmanus news said its raining in new york
no one knows quite how to respond
a large boat sleek and yacht like but without finesse
this is a boat for business heavy and fast
it is moored to the pier
a large crane hoists a pallet of fuel drums from the dock
it swings slowly over the boat
a man on the dock yells in spanish to the crane operator
behind an old and weathered boat in dry dock keaton and verbal watch the boat from the shadows
what are they speaking
russian i think
i dont know
knock it off
mcmanus climbing up the side of the boathouse
continue past him to reveal r a large boat
a very large boat
hockney maneuvers through a mesh of twisted steel arriving at a vantage point near the stern of the large boat
a black van pulls up and parks near the crane
four men in suits get out
one remains with the van and the other three walk toward the boat
on the boat five men come up from below deck
they are tense and cautious around the men in suits
someone speaks in spanish and someone else in russian
it takes a moment before anyone speaks the same tongue
they settle on french for both negotiators
hockney sits in the van
he handles a large shoulder bag stuffed with plastique
he tests a timer on top
he picks up a walkie talkie
are we ready kids
mcmanus is positioning himself on the roof of the boathouse
he stops and grabs his radio
mcmanus if i didnt have to stop and answer you i would be
into radio everyone shut up
mcmanus you better be set up in ten seconds
mcmanus on radio im there
to verbal i want you to stay here
but im supposed to if we dont make it out i want you to take the money and go
confused keaton i cant just i want you to find edie
both of you find some place safe
tell her what happened everything
she knows people
shell know what to do
if we cant get kobayashi my way shell get him her way
what if i just do what i tell you
keaton turns and takes a few steps
he stops and looks back his face marked with guilt and agony
tell her i
tell her i tried
keaton leaves before verbal can respond
he walks down a ramp toward the boat
he is no more than a few yards out of the shadows before the first man sees him
one of the men in suits starts to yell to the others
men pull out guns and try to look as cool as they can
keaton walks right into the face of all of these men undaunted
his hands are in his pockets
above him in the darkness mcmanus pokes his head out and
he pulls his head back and sticks out the barrel of the rifle
keaton comes to a stop about twenty feet from fifteen men all together
mcmanus stares through the scope of his rifle at the scene
the cross hairs breeze past keaton and find a target
a man in a suit
he moves to another and then another picking up speed and mock shooting the men
he is steady and quick
it is clear he could take all fifteen in a few seconds
mcmanus contd pow pow pow pow pow pow
oswald was a fag
the men shout questions at keaton in a number of languages
a few men standing on the dock near the stern of the large boat move towards the commotion
hockney bails out and runs quickly and quietly through the shadows bringing the bomb with him
verbal remains in the darkness looking frightened
boathouse roof a mcmanus still wanders with his scope
mcmanus old mcdonald had a farm ee aye ee aye oh
and on this farm he shot some guys
ba da bip ba da bing bang boom
finally two men walk right towards keaton
the rest train guns on him
they reach for his arms pointing their guns right at him
at the far end of the dock hockney throws his bomb onto the stern of the large boat
the men surrounding keaton are distracted
keaton pulls a pistol out of each pocket and shoots the two men closest to him
mcmanus he fires as fast as he can
the men from the boat and the men in suits try to peg keaton but mcmanus sniping has them running
the crane operator opens the door to bails out leaving the crane in motion
mcmanus runs across the roof of the boathouse and jumps down to the pier
he arrives at a thick mooring cable and climbs across to the boat
i keaton climbs up onto a small lifeboat hanging from the side of the larger boat
from this he climbs aboard the large boat
dock f hockney is firing in all directions
suddenly he realizes no one is left on the dock
finally he turns and runs back for the van parked on the pier above
he finds a ramp leading from the dock to the pier
at the van he finds the one man who has stayed behind to protect it
i i the man hears hockney coming and raises his gun
hockney runs i straight at him screaming frantically
i in spanish boom i he shoots the man point blank in the face and runs over his body as it falls
he gets to the back door of the van and yanks it open
the inside is stacked with large wooden crates
hockney suddenly oblivious to the sound of gunfire opens one of the crates and looks inside
it is filled with money
cash and negotiable bonds of all kinds
blood sprays all over the money
hockney looks at it puzzled
hockney raises a blood soaked hand from his belly
he turns and stares in horror
boom another shot takes off the top of his head
mcmanus runs like a wild man across the deck heading for the hatch
he shoots in all directions as though he has eyes in the back of his head
he sees keaton climbing onto the deck of the boat
verbal is wrestling with what to do
he finally makes a break for the other side of the boathouse
the crane continues to swing
a single bullet hits one of the barrels on the suspended pellet
gasoline pours out through the bullet hole
scene deleted f keaton finds the hatch and goes below shooting a man on his way up the stairs
mcmanus jumps on board and runs down behind him
verbal arrives at the top of the ramp leading from the dock to the pier
he ducks down behind a guardrail beside the ramp
he turns and sees hockneys dead body next to the van
he looks around frantically frozen in terror
it is quiet except for the sounds of screaming far off in the bowels of the boat and the hum of the crane
why didnt you run
i froze up
i thought about fenster and how he looked when we buried him then i thought about keaton
it looked like he might pull it off
rabin steps in and motions for kujan to come outside
rabin and jack baer are in the hall
rabin hands kujan a thick manila folder
kujan thumbs through it
a boy came across a body on the beach this morning
thrown clear when the boat burned
shot once in the head
two guys from the f
just identified him
his name was arturo marquez
a petty smuggler out of argentina
he was arrested in new york last year for trafficking
he escaped to california and got picked up in long beach
they were setting up his extradition when he escaped again
get this edie finneran was called in to advise the proceedings
i called new york county and they fared me a copy of marquezs testimony
he was a rat
kujan pulls out page after page from the file
a big fucking rat
arturo was strongly opposed to going back to prison
so much so that he informed on close to fifty guys
guess who he names for a finale
kujan finds one sheet and notices a paragraph is highlighted
keyser soze theres more
kujan walks in and sits down in front of verbal
i tell you what i know
stop me when it sounds familiar
verbal is confused
there was no dope on that boat
keaton is weaving through tight low ceiling corridors looking in every cabin working his way towards the bottom of the boat
elsewhere in the boat mcmanus is tearing though the corridors seemingly less interested in securing the cargo as he is in killing everyone on board
he screams like a lunatic shooting everything in his path killing some men with his bare hands shooting others stabbing others still with a knife he has brought along
jaime one of the men from the boat is half pushing half helping a thin and sweaty looking man in a checkered bathrobe towards a cabin at the end of
the man in the robe is trembling
he seems stricken with fear
i saw him on deck
jaime pushes him inside the cabin and shuts the door
a stereo playing softly in the room mixes with the mans panicked breathing
the man in the robe screams through the closed door his voice echoing off of the metal bulkheads
jaime stands outside the door of the cabin and turns to face down the hall
off in some other part of the boat he can hear mcmanus wailing like a banshee and the ever less frequent sound of gunshots
keaton has come to the four foot high door to the hold
the door is open slightly
keaton finds this strange
he pushes the door open and steps inside
the hold is empty
he hears a noise behind him
he wheels around to fire
he sees mcmanus in the door
his face is covered with blood
mcmanus did you hear what i heard
what happened to you
mcmanus keyser soze is on the boat
mcmanus i heard somebody screaming his nuts off
he said keyser soze was on the boat
are you alright
mcmanus rubs some of the blood off with his sleeve
oh its not mine
theres no coke
mcmanus looks around the hold as though hell see four and a half tons of dope in some corner where keaton might have missed it
the two men look at one another
there is a long pregnant silence
mcmanus lets get the fuck out of here
right behind you
keaton and mcmanus step out of the hold walking slowly and cautiously back from where they came
they hear the sounds of footsteps running on the deck above and the occasional hollered sentence in spanish
mcmanus i dont think he made it to the boat
they come to a corner
they can go left or right
i cant remember which way
mcmanus right gunshots fill the hallway from behind them
they do not stop to turn around
keaton goes left mcmanus goes right
they run in opposite directions with the sound of gunfire right behind them
jaime squints and cocks his head
someone is coming
he raises a pistol and crouches by the door
the man in the bathrobe sits on the foot of the bed watching the door
he hears the sounds of fighting somewhere not too far away
he crawls over the bed and squeezes between it and the bulkhead
only the top of his head is visible
he starts to cry
boom boom two shots just outside in the hall
suddenly the door bursts open
jaime collapses in a heap on the floor a bullet hole in his eye
the man in the bathrobe looks up at the figure
we cannot see him
i told them nothing
the man in the robe falls dead
the boat is quiet now
keaton walks out onto the deck
he looks out over the pier and sees verbal standing in the middle of the carnage frozen
their eyes meet
keaton waves at him as if to shoe him away
verbal hesitates and finally moves towards the van with the money
he looks back over his shoulder and sees keaton
keaton sees him looking and waves again hurrying him along
verbal turns away and focuses on the van
keaton hears a noise behind him
he swings around and points his gun at mcmanus again
he puts the gun down
he walks slowly across the deck towards keaton
something is not right about him
mcmanus strangest thing
he slumps to the deck
keaton rushes over to him
he kneels down and sees a pipe sticking out of the back of mcmanuss neck
verbal approaches the van stepping over hockneys body
he closes the back doors of the van
he looks to his left at the huge loading crane
he glances upward along the giant arm as it swings steadily on
somewhere off in the distance the sound of sirens can be heard
keaton kneels by mcmanus trembling with rage
after a moment he stands looking down at mcmanus dead body
suddenly verbal realizes something
he turns and goes to call out a warning to keaton
he is too late
keaton never sees the crane coming
the pellet of barrels hits him square in the back and sends him flying into the wheel house of the boat
keaton is still for a moment
finally he tries to get up but finds he cannot move his legs
verbal runs down the ramp as fast as he can
he comes to a rope ladder hanging down the side of the boat
suddenly he stops dead in his tracks looking up at the boat
from where he stands he can just make out the figure of a tau thin man walking along the edge of the deck
he moves quietly and calmly in the shadows towards the crane looking out of place in his expensive suit
something about this man terrifies him
and thats when you say in your statement that you saw
kujan picks up his copy of verbals statement to the d
a man in a suit with a slim build
wait a minute
looking at watch i dont have a minute
are you saying it was keyser soze
you told the d
you didnt know who it was
verbal is drowning in kujans interrogation
he looks dazed
i there had to be dope there
dont shine me verbal
no more stalling
you know what im getting at
for the first time verbal stands and tries to move away from kujan but kujan stays in his face backing him into a corner
verbal shields himself with his hands and shuts his eyes
i dont know what youre talking about
verbal looks into kujans eyes with genuine terror
kujans face is red his body trembles
his locomotive breathing is the only sound in the room
i dont understand what youre saying
i saw keaton get shot i swear to you
then why didnt you help him
i was afraid okay
somehow i was sure it was keyser soze at that point
i couldnt bring myself to raise my gun to him
it was keyser soze agent kujan
i mean the devil himself
how do you shoot the devil in the back
verbal holds up a shaking twisted hand
what if you miss
verbal is hiding in the tangle of girders and cables on the barge
keatons body is completely obscured
the man in a suit strides across the deck over to keaton stopping to relieve himself on a small fire on the deck
he walks up and stands over keaton
the two men exchange words and the man in the suit pulls out a pistol
he points it at keaton
he can just make out police cars coming in the distance
verbal hears a shot from the deck of the boat
he turns in time to see the man in the suit running across the deck toward the gangway
verbal can barely see the man from where he is now
the man in the suit is covered by shadows and the poor angle from the barge
verbal strains to see but he cannot
the man in the suit stops long enough to pull out a lighter
he turns and walks back across the deck and out of sight
a moment later flames leap up from on the deck
the mesh of steel and rubber leaves a dark and open cocoon at its base
sirens are close now
the sound of fire raging out of control
new light flickering in the surrounding darkness
ever hear of him
he was a stool pigeon for the justice department
he swore out a statement to federal marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one keyser soze and had intimate knowledge of his business including but not exclusive
to drug trafficking and murder
i never heard of him
his own people were selling him to a gang of hungarians
most likely the same hungarians that sate all but wiped out back in turkey
the money wasnt there for dope
the hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger soze for them
i said i never heard of him
but keaton had
edie finneran was his extradition advisor
she knew who he was and what he knew
i dont there were no drugs on that boat
it was a hit
a suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger keyser soze so sate had a few thieves put to it
men he knew he could march into certain death
but how wait
youre saying soze sent t us to kill someone
im saying keaton did
verbal cannot grasp this
he squints trying to understand
verbal he left you behind for a reason
if you all knew soze could find you anywhere why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat
he wanted me to live
why did he want you to live
a one time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat cripple
i dont buy that reform story for a minute
and even if i did i certainly dont believe he would send you to protect her
because he was my friend
you werent friends
keaton didnt have friends
he saved you because he wanted it that way
it was his will
verbal grinds to a mental halt trying to grasp the implication
keaton was keyser soze
the kind of guy who could wrangle the wills of men like hockney and mcmanus
the kind of man who could engineer a police line up from all his years of contacts in n
verbal stands on wobbly legs shaking with anger
a strange look crosses verbals face
shock perhaps or revelation
they found her yesterday in a hotel in pennsylvania
shot twice in the head
it starts to sink in with verbal
his eyes swell
he used all of you to get him on that boat
he couldnt get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man
the one man that could identify him
this is all bullshit
he left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead
you saw him die right
or did you
you had to hide when the first police cars showed up
you heard the shot just before the fire but you didnt see him die
i knew him
he would never he programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to
customs has been
kujan contd investigating him for years
he knew we were close
you said it yourself
where is the political pressure coming from
why are you being protected
its keaton making sure you tell us what youre supposed to
immunity is your reward
im a cripple
verbal hears the weight of his words and falls back in his chair kujan looks at him with some pity but he is too far in to stop
because youre a cripple verbal
because youre stupid
because you were weaker than them
because you couldnt see far enough into him to know the truth
verbal is crying now
he shakes his head eyes closed
if hes dead verbal if what you say is true then it wont matter
it was his idea to hit the taxi service in new york wasnt it
tell me the truth
sobbing it was all keaton
we followed him from the beginning
kujan smiles with triumphant satisfaction
i didnt know
i saw him die
i believe hes dead
christ why lie about everything else then
you know what its like agent kujan to know youll never be good
not good like you
you got good all fucked around
i mean a stand up guy
i grew up knowing i was never going to be good at anything cause i was a cripple
shit i wasnt
verbal contd even a good thief
but i thought the one thing i could be good at was a keeping my mouth shut keeping the code
i didnt want to tell you for my dignity thats all and you robbed me agent kujan
you robbed me
kujan pulls the microphone out from under his tie and puts it on the desk
verbal actually manages to snort a laugh but only briefly overcome by an apparent wave of nausea
youre not safe on your own
you think hes
is he keyser soze i dont know verbal
it seems to me that keyser sate is a shield
like you said a spook story but i know keaton and someone out there is pulling strings for you
stay here and let us protect you
im not bait
i post today
you posted twenty minutes ago
captain leo wants you out of here a
unless you turn states
i take my chances thank you
its tougher to buy the cheapest bag man than it is to buy a cop
where are you going to go verbal
you gonna run
turn states evidence
you might never see trial
if somebody wants to get you you know theyll get you out there
maybe so but im no rat agent kujan
you tricked me thats all
i wont keep my mouth shut cause im scared
i keep it shut cause i let keaton down by getting caught edie finneran too
and if they kill me its
verbal contd because theyll hear i dropped dime
theyll probably hear it from you
verbal stands mustering his shattered dignity and walks towards the door
rabin opens it for him from outside
for once kujan cannot bring himself to look at verbal
verbal turns to the door stopping to look rabin in the eye
he steps out of the room and into the hall
rabin follows him
daniel metzheiser comes out of arkosh kovashs room with a single sheet of x inch paper in his hand
he inspects the sketch with great interest
he folds the edges of the paper back to make it smaller
metzheiser walks behind the reception desk without asking the nurse for permission and helps himself to the fax machine
verbal is downstairs in the depot of the police station picking up his personal belongings
a fat white haired cop is checking off the items as he takes them out of the tray in which they are kept
one watch gold
one cigarette lighter gold
one wallet brown
one pack of cigarettes
verbal collects his personal items and shuffles on his lame leg toward the exit
jack baer stands by a fax machine
a green light comes on next to a digital display
the display reads receiving
kujan stares solemnly at the bulletin board drinking from rabins coffee cup
rabin sits at the desk sifting through the mound of gapers as though considering organizing them once and for all
you still dont know shit
i know what i wanted to know about keaton
which is shit
hell have to know how close we came
keyser sate or not if keatons alive hell never come up again
i find him
waste of time
to himself a rumor is not a rumor that doesnt die
something i forget it
kujan shakes his head
he gestures to the desk
man youre a fucking slob
rabin regards the mess of his office
its got its own system though
it all makes sense when you look at it right
you just have to step back from
rabin contd it you know
you should see my garage now thats a horror show
kujan is not listening
he has been staring at the bulletin board lost in thought his unfocused eyes drifting across the mess of papers not looking at anything at all
verbal steps out into the sunlight putting on a pair of cheap sunglasses
he looks up and down the crowded street
people on their way to and from lunch no doubt
cars choke the street in front of the police department as they wait for pedestrians to clear the way
a single sheet of paper comes out of the fax machine face down
kujan still stares at the bulletin board
suddenly kujans face changes
he leans in closer to the bulletin board and squints his eyes
his face changes again
first a look of puzzlement then confusion finally realization
the coffee cup tumbles from his hand
it hits the floor with the smash of cheap porcelain
coffee splatters everywhere
rabin snaps out of his droning and looks up in surprise
kujan is staring not at what is on the bulletin board but at the bulletin board itself
his eyes follow the aluminum frame mounted firmly to the wall
one might note its sturdy construction and its convenient size
big enough to hold a lifetime of forgotten and disregarded notes and facts
years of police trivia that has been hung and forgotten with the intention of finding a use for it all someday
one might want such a bulletin board for ones self
one would look to see who makes such a bulletin board
kujans eyes are locked on a metal plate bearing the manufacturers name
it reads quartet skokie illinois kujans eyes flash all over the bulletin board
he finds a picture of rabin in the far corner
he stands beside a scale in fishing gear
he proudly holds a hand out to his freshly caught marlin
his eyes skim quickly over and stop on an eight and a half by eleven inch fax sheet of what must be a three hundred pound black man
kujan glazes over his name it is irrelevant
his aliases stand out
slavin bricks shank redfoot thee rooster
kujans eyes widen with sudden realization
he runs for the door
his foot crushes the broken pieces of rabins coffee cup
the cup that hovered over verbals head for two hours
kujan is in too much of a hurry to notice the two words printed on the jagged piece that had been the bottom of the cheap mug
kujan is sprinting wildly down the hall for the stairs
verbal looks behind him and sees another cop standing just inside the doorway lighting a cigarette
the cop notices verbal and watches him in the way that cops look at people they cannot place in the category of idiot citizen or stupid criminal
verbal smiles politely meekly at the cop and walks down the steps into the moving throng
kujan runs up to the desk where verbal had only moments before picked up his belongings
rabin is right behind him a look of absolute confusion on his face
where is he
did you see him
t the cripple
he went that way
the cog gestures towards the door
kujan runs outside looking around frantically
verbal limps his way carefully across the sidewalk avoiding people as best as he can
he looks over his shoulder getting farther away from the police station
he can see rabin and the cop on the steps looking around with strange lost expressions on their faces
he does not notice the car creeping along the curb beside him
the drivers hands tap the wheel patiently
his eyes follow verbal as he fumbles through the crowd
kujan pushes and shoves looking this way and that
low angle on the feet of dozens of people
verbals feet emerge from the crowd on the far side
they hobble along the curb
suddenly the right foot seems to relax a little the inward angle straightens itself out in a few paces and the limp ceases as though the leg has grown another
verbals hands are rummaging around in his pockets
the good left hand comes up with a pack of cigarettes the bad right hand comes up with a lighter
the right hand flexes with all
of the grace and coordination of a sculptors flicking the clasp on the antique lighter with the thumb striking the flint with the index finger
it is a fluid motion somewhat showy
verbal lights a cigarette and smiles to himself
he turns and sees the car running alongside
jack beer pulls the sheet out of the fax machine and turns it over revealing the composite sketch of keyser soze
though crude and distorted one cannot help but notice how much it leaks like verbal kint
the car stops
the driver gets out
it is kobayashi or the man we have come to know as such
he smiles to verbal
verbal steps off of the curb returning the smile as he opens the passenger door and gets in
the man called kobayashi gets in the drivers seat and pulls away
a moment later agent david kujan of u
customs wanders into the frame looking around much in the way a child would when lost at the circus
he takes no notice of the car pulling out into traffic blending in with the rest of the cars filled with people on their way back to work
