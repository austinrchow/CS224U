the godfather part two b
b if window
href b b part two screenplay by mario puzo and francis ford coppola september the paramount pictures logo is presented over a simple black background as a single trumpet plays
the familiar theme of a waltz
white lettering fades in mario puzos the godfather there is a pause as the trumpet concludes and there is the additional title part two standing impassively like a young prince
recently crowned king
close view on michaels hand
rocco lampone kisses his hand
then it is taken away
we can see only the empty desk and chair of michaels father vito corleone
we hear over this very faintly a funeral dirge played in the distance as the view moves slowly closer to the empty desk and chair
we can barely make out the funeral procession passing over the burnt brown of a dry river bed
the figures move slowly seemingly from out of hundreds of years of the past
the musicians walking unsteadily on the rocky bed their instruments harsh and blaring
they are followed by six young peasant men carrying the crude wooden coffin on their shoulders
then the widow a strong large woman dressed in black and not accepting the arms of those walking with her
behind her not more than twenty relatives few children and paisani continue alone behind the coffin
suddenly we hear the shots of the lupara and the musicians stop their playing
the entire procession scatters in odd directions along the rocky river bed
the young men struggle with the burden of the heavy coffin throwing it out of balance and nearly crashing to the ground
we hear a woman screaming sicilian theyve killed young paolo
theyve killed the boy paolo
across the slain body of a fourteen year old boy lying on the parched ground
in the distance we see four or five of the mourning women the wind blowing their black dresses and veils running up to the body of the boy
they begin to wail and cry out in anguished sicilian as the widow the mother of the murdered boy holds her child in her arms his fresh blood wetting her
a boy eight or nine with wide frightened eyes being pulled quickly by the hand
this is vito andolini who is to become the godfather
the view alters revealing that he is being pulled along by his mother the widow across a field leading to the ornamental gates of a baronial estate of some forgotten
at various positions near the gates are men with shotguns or lupara
the gates are opened and the widow and her boy are shown before don francesco a man in his sixties
he wears his trousers with suspenders and an open white shirt sloppily tucked in over his enormous belly
he wears a hat to protect him from the white hot sun and proudly displays a gold watch and chain over his vest
he sits in a chair near a group of his men in the garden listening to the widow who stands before him with her only son
sicilian don francesco
you murdered my husband because he would not bend
and his oldest son paolo because he swore revenge
but vitone is only nine and dumb witted
he never speaks
sicilian im not afraid of his words
sicilian he is weak
sicilian he will grow strong
sicilian the child cannot harm you
sicilian he will be a man and then he will come for revenge
as she pleads the widow moves closer to the don until she has practically thrown herself to her knees before him
sicilian i beg you don francesco spare my only son
he is all i have
in the name of the holy spirit i swear he will never be a danger to you
suddenly she reaches under her skirt where she has hidden a kitchen knife
continuing but i will kill you myself
she lunges at the mafia chieftain vitone go
the boy runs as fast as he can out through the gates
then there is a lupara blast
he turns and sees his mother flung a distance of five feet from the short range of the terrible blast of the shotgun
then he sees the men turn their attention to him
one fires at him but the boy is quick and disappears into a grove of olive trees
two men roam the deserted streets of corleone carrying lupare
every so often they stop and one shouts in a loud almost singsong voice like a fish peddler
their names are mosca and strollo
sicilian our friend promises misery to anyone who harbors the boy vito andolini
he turns and shouts in the other direction our friend promises misery to anyone who harbors the boy vito andolini
a family quietly eats their dinner
the father is the local policeman as indicated by his uniform jacket and gun hanging nearby
our friend will be hard with any family who gives help to vito andolini
one of the children looks up about to speak
but the father sternly indicates that nothing must be said
they go on with their dinner
the men continue walking up and throughout the streets far in the distance
misery to any family who harbors the boy vito
four little girls watch with wide eyes as their mother and father bind vito tightly in swaddled cloth and then lift him up to the side of a mule counter
balancing a heavy load of firewood
the father looks at the boys almost stoically calm little face
we pray for you
he pulls the fabric over the boys face
our friend promises misery to any family
the men continue on their night walk up to the plaza of the church
sicilian who harbors the boy vitone andolini
the figure of a single man on a mule passes them
sicilian let no one give help to the boy vito andolini
the man on the mule makes his way out of the village and disappears into the distance
we begin to hear very quietly the waltz repeated once again
huddled in blankets on the deck of the ship in steerage
he does not say a word
the waltz grows louder as the view alters revealing the hundreds of immigrant families huddled together with all their earthly possessions on their way to america
then suddenly the waltz stops
we glide past the statue of liberty
view on the immigrants standing on shipboard silently looking
vito is standing with them his eyes wide
camera moves in on the statue then moving past on to the beautiful buildings of ellis island
a tugboat pulls a barge brimming with immigrants into the ellis island harbor
uniformed officials of the immigration service load them up toward the main building
the hundreds of immigrant families sit on rows of benches in the great hall
various painted lines lead to the steps and processing rooms above
there is the babble of many interviews going on simultaneously uncertainly in different languages
vito is bundled in an old coat with a large tag pinned on it vitone andolini corleone sicilia
he stands moves up in the line when several other immigrant boys older than he rush up an push him back in the line
weak from the trip he falls to the floor
the boys laugh derisive in a language he cannot understand
he struggles to his feet lifting his makeshift bags staring at them in an icy hatred
three or four interviews are crowded into the small room they are conducted in english
from the expression on vitos face and from the fragmented of the english we realize that he doesnt understand a word of it
english what is your name
the man waits impatiently
vito doesnt answer
the official pulls the tag pinned onto his coat and copies to down on his form using a typewriter
speaking as he types vito
step up over there
he hands the form to another official
close view on the form
the name has been entered as vito corleone
vito is stripped to the waist as other immigrants wait
the doctor is just finishing his examination
he shakes his head and then writes on the medical form
can you understand me
vito stares blankly
he doesnt understand
the doctor turns to the immigration official
officials move a group of immigrant men including vito to the quarantine section of the island
the official stops at each doorway and reads off a name
the man moves into the room and the group proceeds
no one responds
the guard moves to the boy reads his new name tag
and then not unkindly thats you
he opens the door and vito enters the room
the view slowly begins to pull back revealing this to be the view from inside the quarantine cell where vito stands on his bench looking out to the statue through
the barred window
then he turns and sits in the corner
he is silent for a long time
then in a sweet pure voice he sings to himself in sicilian
a nine year old boy dressed immaculately in white with a large white silk bow tied to his shoulder moving slowly down the aisle of the church with a group
of other children dressed in white
he has dark black hair and his face is unmistakably similar to young vitos
he moves slowly his hands clasped around a golden missal
we hear only the pure voice of vito in sicilian his sad song reaching out from the past as anthony corleone his grandson moves on the way to his first
holy communion more than fifty years later
the little children move in procession down to the altar where the priest raises the host and performs the communion mass in latin
ecce agnus dei ecce qui tollit peccata mundi
and altar boys as he moves along the row of kneeling children blessing them and administering their first communion
as the innocent faces receive the host finally the priest comes to anthony
the lawns of this great estate on the shore of lake tahoe are covered with guests of a wonderful party to honor the first holy communion of anthony corleone the
son of mr
a full dance orchestra plays music of the times on a pavilion bandstand built especially for the occasion
speedboats roar through the water pulling youthful waterskiers and the pool and private harbor are filled with laughing swimming guests
it is fall of
anthony in his communion suit sits alone at the table looking like a lonely young prince
he does and a flash goes off
now one with the whole family
corleone cant right now
kay corleone enters from the side leading her four year old daughter mary and mama corleone to pose with anthony
but well get one with the ladies
all together now cmon anthony
cheese and flash thank you
she smiles as she leaves the photographer and then lets out a weary sigh to mama as she touches the slightly protruding belly
do you think itll show in the picture
two months never shows
two months look like you had a big lunch
a slender aristocratic woman in her late forties is waving to kay
im fran barrett our place is just down the lake
this is my husband marshall
im so happy you could come
the place is transformed
weve been watching workmen come and go all summer
where is mr
a business meeting ran late
but he promised he wouldnt be long
kay puts her arm around little anthonys shoulder
this is our son anthony vito corleone
today he made his first holy communion
a confusion of cars arriving and parking
the squad of parking attendants are supplemented by a whole team of the local police working as high class parking valets
a very beautiful statuesque woman though slightly drunk deanna dunn slams the door of a powder blue mercedes and hurries barefoot through the great stone gate
i will not shut my mouth and keep your goddamn hands off of me
she is followed by a harried freddie corleone dressed with flash in the hollywood style and carrying her shoes in his hands
wait a minute lets go for a drive
i just had a drive besides i want to see my brother in law michael
trying to get her to put her shoes on yeah but i dont want him to see you
deanna pauses reflectively a moment allowing fredo to get her shoes on
what beats me is how you guys could be brothers
you musta been your mothers rotten egg
she kicks off the shoes giggling and runs toward a waiter
lifting a glass of champagne young man young man
thank you young man
impressed excuse me but arent you
yes you saw me in the movies good humor man and yes i had more off than my shoes
relax freddie honey
come dance with me
she extends her hand to him
listen michaels got a lot of nice people here
friends of kays
hell never forgive me if you ruin his party
i hate to see you cringe in front of him
how come youre so scared of your own kid brother
hes the head of the family
disgusted she turns around and heads toward the music
dont follow me
rushing through the tables waving an arm jangling with gold jewelry and carrying several gift wrapped packages is a hardened and aging connie corleone
she is followed by a blond and wrinkled handsome escort named merle
here i am
she throws her arms around her mother who returns the affection somewhat reproachfully
we expected you last week we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week
i know it was chaos but anyway here i am one week late
lifting a shiny green package out of merles arms this is for my mama
you remember merle
not giving him a chance to greet her yes thank you
how are the kids
well thank you they asked for you all week
i got surprises for everybody
glancing at the wrapping bought at the airport
gazing about this is swell
ive got things to get straight with him and i cant wait on line
you go see your children first and then you wait to see your brother like everybody else
a porch like foyer of the boathouse where a group of five or six men wait some nervously
some sit and some pace
on one of these men frankie pentangeli approaching his sixties with gray hair the little of it left
hes a bit scruffy this mornings shave of his white beard is not perfect and he seems tired
he is accompanied by an associate bodyguard willy cicci thin and dark and also dressed up for the occasion
frankie tries to get the attention of one of the waiters a college groomed young man in white sports jacket and black bow tie
you got any red wine
offering the tray only champagne and cocktails
finally he sees someone he recognizes fredo and shouts out in a husky voice fredo
you look great
fredo squints in his direction finally recognizes him
frankie five angels
thought you were never coming west
affectionately gotta check up on my boys
hey whats with the food
some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver
canapes he says
i say can a peas my ass thats a ritz cracker with chopped liver
go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or ill send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners
they get a good laugh at this fresh breath of new york
gee frankie its good to see you
reminds me of old times
you remember willy cicci dont you freddie
we was all together with the old man clemenza in brooklyn
we were all upset about that
thats what im here to talk to your brother about
whats with him i got to get a letter of introduction to have a sitdown
throwing his arm around him cmon i see what i can do
the orchestra wears white summer sportcoats and black tuxedo slacks as they play a tango behind monogrammed music stands
a professional dance team probably imported from vegas dance the tango for the excited guests
a large and very beautiful room overlooking the lake
it is dominated by an enormous bar behind which stands albert neri discreetly in the background
michael corleone sits on a large sofa his back to us
standing to one side is a tired and somewhat uneasy tom hagen
standing before michael is sandra corleone sonnys widow her daughter one of the twins francesca corleone and a handsome young man of twenty gardner shaw
michael this is gardner shaw
francesca and he have been seeing each other for six months now
gardner this is francies uncle michael
a little nervous ive heard a lot about you mr
the couple sit themselves on the sofa opposite michael
they would like to set an engagement date and
let them speak for themselves
view on michael calm thoughtful
one can tell that he has special affection for his niece
we love each other uncle michael
and we want to be married
i came to ask for your blessing
there is a loud knocking on the door then fredos voice
guess whos here
neri goes to answer it cracks the door open
not now freddie
tell mike frankie five angels is here
neri closes the door and michael looks at the nervous young man
francesca is my oldest brothers daughter
he died many years ago and ever since ive felt much more of a father than an uncle
i love her very much
im pleased and impressed that you had the thought to come to me before going on with your plans
it shows me that youre a considerate man and will be good to her
what are you studying in college
my major is fine arts sir
how will fine arts support your new wife
its embarrassing to say sir but im a major stockholder in the family corporation
smiling never be embarrassed by your wealth
this recent contempt for money is still another trick of the rich to keep the poor without it
warmly of course i give you my blessing
lets set the wedding soon
it will be my pleasure to give the bride away
they all smile and rise
continuing and take a few courses in business administration just to be on the safe side
they laugh michael moves toward them
francesca throws her arms around him and kisses her favorite uncle
the flushed young man shakes his hand heartily
thank you uncle michael
they all take their leave michael turns to hagen
make her dowry impressive
he comes from a family who still thinks an italian bride goes barefoot
francesca and gardner are greeted by her twin sister and their young friends who squeal and embrace at the good news
someone throws someone in the pool and life is good
francesca kisses her aunt kay
uncle michael is the greatest man ever
view on kay happy for her niece
michael sits in the darkened boathouse
tom hagen paces
michael is looking at photographs
neri stands over him
studying the pictures
his name is fred vincent
he owns a small pizza parlor in buffalo
snapshots of a middle aged man handsome italian
there is something familiar about him
continuing american wife and two small kids
we traced him and found that hes in the country illegally from sicily
michael looks at another picture
the same man
only younger and dressed in sicilian shepherds clothing
we remember him as fabrizzio
michaels traitorous bodyguard in sicily
came over around
sponsored by the barzini family
michael puts the pictures down
almost to himself revenge is a dish that tastes best when its cold
how do you want me to handle it
michael glances at hagen who has been waiting in the room
hagen brings him a folder then as michael glances through it ive cleared it through the senators chief aide a man named turnbull
turnbulls a heavy gambler and into us for over a hundred grand so i figure his information is reliable
neri moves to the bar to prepare michael a drink
the senator can be set up but he thinks of himself as a clean politician
so its got to be on terms he can live with campaign contribution donation to a charitable cause that he controls things like that
if he gets even the inkling that you think youre buying him hell freeze up
nevadas a funny state they like things both ways here
turnbull says the senator will be here at two thirty and hes been primed
he knows youll want to meet with him alone and he knows its about the tropicanas license
at any rate he expects to be introduced around to some of the influential people here today and generally treated as an ordinary guest
just go light on him mikey sometimes the biggest crooks dont like to think of themselves as crooks
michael glances at hagen as though that last remark was unnecessary
im sorry of course you know that
that gives me time to see my boy
michael doesnt want to see her
i promised she said it was urgent
apologize to pentangeli
neri opens the door hagen exits and connie steps in impatiently followed by merle
i said i would see my sister alone
i think this concerns me too
taking a cigarette from the dispenser you dont do you
connie steps forward kisses michael on the cheek
how are you honey
youve met merle havent you
he was with me in vegas
i saw him with you
were going to europe next week
i want to get passage booked on the queen
why do you come to me
why dont you go to a travel agent
were going to get married first
michael is silent
then he rises and moves to the window overlooking the lake
the ink on your divorce isnt dry
your children see you on weekends your oldest boy michael francis
was in some trouble with the reno police over some petty theft that you dont even know about
you fly around the world with lazy young men who dont have any love for you and use you like a whore
youre not my father
then why do you come to me
because i need money
softly connie i want to be reasonable with you
you have a house here with us
you can live here with your kids
and you wont be deprived of anything
i dont know much about merle i dont know what he does for a living what he lives on
why dont you tell him marriage is really out of the question and that you cant see him any more
but if you disobey me and marry this pimp
it would disappoint me
it was my fathers money and im entitled to what i need
where is tom hagen
she turns angrily leaving michael standing face to face with merle
are you finished
i think so
merle puts out his cigarette and leaves quickly
the orchestra has struck up a paul jones where two concentric circles of young people march in opposite directions until the music stops
then they take whomever is opposite them as their new dance partner
francesca and her twin gardner and their elite young friends roar out of the private harbor to get up on the water skis
we notice rocco lampone move along a path leading to a separate and more private boathouse
a small covered craft approaches ties off and a group of three men step on to the pathway shake hands with lampone and follow him to the large boathouse where
michael conducts his business
pentangeli has led mama up to the dance floor and is having some difficulty with the orchestra
i cant believe that out of thirty professional musicians not one of you is italian
as the musicians laugh cmon give us a tarantella
he waves his hands conducting and singing
the piano starts a vamp the drums uncertainly join in
a clarinet starts to play pop goes the weasel and soon the rest of the orchestra is playing that
they look to pentangeli for approval
disgusted he goes back to his table eating a handful of canapes
rocco ushers an older italian bundled up against the cold and wet of his boatride to michael
the man shows respect to michael who quickly indicates that neri should get him a drink
rocco his friends must be hungry
see what you can do but id like to keep them away from the guests
the older man johnny blue boy ola gestures to his bodyguards and they follow lampone
you know my lawyer tom hagen
sure i remember tom from the old days
tom shakes hands with ola remembering him and his importance
tom isnt going to sit in with us johnny
he only handles specific areas of the family business
he gathers up some of his papers as the three men remain silent waiting for him to go before they talk
its clear tom doesnt want to be excluded
if you need anything just
just tell rocco im waiting
hagen nods and leaves
as soon as the door closes i just left our friend in miami
how is his health
is there anything i can do anything i can send
he appreciates your concern michael and your respect
theres a knock on the door a moment and then rocco quietly enters and takes his place without disturbing the conversation
the hotels registered owners are one jacob lawrence and sidney barclay both beverly hills attorneys
in reality its split between the old lakeville road group from cleveland and our friend in miami
he takes care of others outside the country you know who i mean
meyer klingman runs the store and does all right but ive been instructed to tell you that if you move him out our friend in miami will go along with
hes very kind tell him its appreciated
im sure it will be profitable all the way around
he always makes money for his partners
one by one our old friends are gone
death natural or not prison deported
our friend in miami is the only one left because he always made money for his partners
the door opens suddenly and standing there in his white communion suit is michaels boy anthony
a moment later kay appears and takes the boys hand
anthony daddys busy
rising this is my boy and my wife
john ola of miami
im sorry michael
senator gearys here and mr
barrett wanted to thank you before they left
wont you join us mr
olas just leaving kay
please tell the senator i wont be a minute
pause she stands there a moment
kay closes the door
it seems as though michael has violated some sort of promise to her by having this man here today
she looks up toward the first boathouse
the covered launch and olas three bodyguards eating while they wait
anthony runs away from her heading toward the house
she runs after him anthony where are you going
moodily the boy stops turns and walks back to his table of honor without answering her
the orchestra has taken its break now two couples in formal dress are performing the quartet from rigoletto
sitting by himself a little down having a drink
hes waiting for michael to re summon him
sandra sonnys widow sits opposite him
wheres my wife
with mama putting the baby to sleep
francescas very happy
michael was kind to her
she idolizes him
pause she looks at a despondent hagen the children are all out in the speedboat
im going to my house
sandra gets up still an attractive woman and walks alone to the back path that leads to her home on the estate
the returned orchestra strikes a big show biz chord intended to command the guests attention
the orchestra leader raises his hands for silence and makes an announcement over the p
ladies and gentlemen a most distinguished guest would like to say a few words senator and mrs
pat geary of the state of nevada
a big hand as the smiling senator introduces his wife by holding her arm up to the crowd and then proceeds alone to the bandstand
michael stands with kay and mrs
the senators presence seems to be a statement of political and social status
a little distance away his beautiful son anthony sits quietly in an unmistakably morose mood
we hear the applause and whistles echoing in the distance
sandra stands in her bedroom looking at the door
we see a photograph of sonny and also one of their wedding
a moment goes by and then tom hagen enters closing the door behind him
we begin to hear senator gearys amplified voice resounding over the lake
hagen moves to sandra
she takes him in her arms comforting holding his head against her full breast
quietly he doesnt want my help any more
he doesnt need it
we dont know thats true he never said that
i can feel it in the way he talks to me
he moves to the dresser pours himself a drink
just now when johnny ola showed up he asked me to leave them alone
ola is hyman roths sicilian contact
i was on the inside of ten twenty meetings with him
but today mike asked me to leave like an outsider
talk to him
tell him how you feel
its as though he blames me for the ground the family lost when i was consigliere to sonny
sandra pulls hagen to her and kisses him passionately on the mouth
i love michael i want to help him be close to him
i dont want to end up a third string lawyer making property settlements for the hotels
sandra knows he needs her
slowly she begins to undress
we have a little time now
my thanks and the thanks of the young people of the state of nevada for this most impressive endowment
he holds a check in his hand made to the university in the name of anthony vito corleone
thank you mr
senator geary returns the microphone to the maestro who adds and now the nevada boys choir have prepared a special thank you for mr
he turns to a small choir master who leads the boys choir in a choral arrangement of mr
shaking hands with michael as press photographers snap pictures showing the check showing a special award of gratitude from the state mrs
corleone and mrs
geary all together michael and his son senator geary and michaels son and on and on
in the midst of this where can we meet alone
michael indicates the boathouse a distance away where neri seems to be waiting for them
then michael leans to rocco find hagen
rocco sets off as more pictures are taken and the sings its lovely arrangement of mr
michael the senator neri and rocco make a group in the dark large room
it was very kind of you to come to my home on this occasion senator
my wife has been very concerned with making a good impression on the people who are our neighbors and your appearance here has made her very happy
if i can ever perform a service for you you only have to ask
the door opens and hagen sheepishly makes his way in
my lawyer tom hagen
he arranged this all through your man turnbull
i thought we would meet alone
i trust these men with my life
they are my right arms i cannot insult them by sending them away
taking out some medication some water
he addresses that to neri who resentfully goes to fetch the senator a glass of water
im going to be very frank with you
maybe more frank than any man in my position has ever spoken to you before
michael nods indicating that he should do so
the corleone family controls two major hotels in vegas one in reno
the licenses were grandfathered in so you had no difficulties with the gaming commission
but i have the idea from sources
takes the water from neri and swallows his pills that youre planning to move in on the tropicana
in another week or so youll move klingman out which leaves you with only one technicality
the license which is now in klingmans name
turnbull is a good man
lets forget the bullshit i dont want to stay here any longer than i have to
you can have the license for two hundred and fifty thousand in cash plus a monthly fee equal to five percent of the gross
michael is taken aback he looks at hagen
of all three corleone hotels
hagen is frustrated all his information was wrong
senator geary i speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state
i have made that state my home plan to raise my children here
the license fee from the gambling commission costs one thousand dollars why would i ever consider paying more
im going to squeeze you corleone because i dont like you i dont like the kind of man you are
i despise your masquerade and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family
glances at michael
makes no outward reaction
quietly were all part of the same hypocrisy senator
but never think it applies to my family
all right then let me say youll pay me because its in your interests to pay me
ill expect your answer with payment by tomorrow morning
only dont contact me
from now on deal only through turnbull
he is almost out the door
cold and calm you can have my answer now if youd like
geary turns back
my offer is this
not even the thousand dollars for the gaming commission which id appreciate if you would put up personally
geary returns michaels hard look then laughs and leaves
slowly michael turns to hagen
embarrassed at being so off the mark
its all right tom well talk later
tell frankie pentangeli id like him to have dinner at my family table before we do business
now the light has faltered and the young waiters have put up the night lights
the tables are all properly set for dinner with candles on each one
the orchestra is playing quiet unobtrusive dinner music and many of the guests have begun to help themselves to the impressive buffet under a party tent
michael sits at a large table with kay his son anthony mama hagen and teresa connie and merle fredo and deanna and frankie pentangeli
this the table of honor all raise their glasses and repeat the toast
whats cent anne
a hundred years
its a toast
it means we should all live happily for one hundred years
if my father were alive itd be true
merle have you met my sister in law deanna
what a pleasure merle
shaking hands sicilian those two are perfect for each other
whats that mean
sicilian michael in all respect i didnt come three thousand miles for dinner
sicilian i know
sicilian when do we talk
sicilian after dinner
by now the conversation has become exclusively sicilian with merle and deanna looking from side to side like in a tennis match
finally kay to be polite anthony you were talking to mr
his name is five angels
yeah the kid and me talked sicilian
a one way conversation
pentangeli is angry but because it is michael he is talking to he keeps his voice low and represses his desire to shout
sure pete clemenza died of a heart attack but the rosato brothers gave it to him
we were all heartbroken at the news but that wasnt cause to start a war
okay now its my family in brooklyn and i wanna keep up clemenzas loyalty to you
but how can i run my family with you challenging my every move
youre too far from the street mike the only way to reason with the rosato brothers is to whack em and whack em fast
you were unfair with them
clemenza promised rosato three territories in the bronx after he died and then you took over and welched
clemenza promised them nothing he hated the sonsuvbitches
they feel cheated
michael youre sitting up here in the sierra mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way i run my family
suddenly in sicilian your family still carries the name corleone and you will run it like a corleone
sicilian and while i feed my family in new york you put the knife in my back in miami
firm frankie youre a good old man and youve been loyal to my father for years
so i hope you can explain what you mean
the rosatos are running crazy taking hostages spitting in my face because theyre backed by the jew in miami
thats why i want you to be fair with them
how can you be fair with animals
they recruit niggers and spicks they do violence in their own grandmothers neighborhoods
and everything is dope and whores the gambling is left to last
let me run my family without you on my back
i want them taken care of
there are things that i have planned with hyman roth
i dont want them disturbed
you give your loyalty to a jew over your own blood
frankie you know my father respected roth did business with him
he did business
but he never trusted him
pentangeli takes his hat and leaves
should he go
the old man had too much vino rosso or hed never talk openly that way
let him go back to new york ive already made my plans
he checks his watch its late ive spent so little time at the party
by now the sun has fallen and the lawns of the corleone estate are lit by moonlight
beautifully dressed couples dance as the orchestra plays a foxtrot of the late fifties
deanna has been dancing with fredo she has gotten drunk and it teasing her husband by flirting with other men on the floor
i wanta dance
whatsa matter with that
dancing is alright youre falling on the floor
whatsamatter you dont want me to dance with him cause hes a man
deanna im going to belt you right in the mouth
these eye ties are really crazy when it comes to their wives
by now guests are starting to notice the disturbance michael is with kay and some friends rocco catches his eye
jesus never marry a wop they treat their wives like shit
view on kay listening embarrassed by her flashy sister in law
rocco passes by fredo and whispers freddie mike says take care of it or i have to
hes a friend of your brother
without another word rocco grabs firm hold of her and whisks her out of the crowd
shuffle off to buffa
shuffle off to buffa
shuffle off to buffalooooo
freddie mops his forehead and moves to michael
hey mike what can i say
forget it just go take care of her
a large group of tahoe teenagers join the corleone youngsters sitting around a large fire out by the harbor
gardner and francie sitting arm in arm
little anthony in his white suit sitting alone
a taxi pulls up and is signaled over to the gate by a policeman carrying a torch flashlight
connie and merle enter merle tips the cop and the cab drives off
kay and michael dancing in the moonlight
hows the baby
sleeping inside me
does it feel like a boy
yes michael it does
im sorry about some of the people i had to see today
it was bad timing
but it couldnt be helped
it made me think of what you told me once
in five years the corleone family will be completely legitimate
that was seven years ago
he has no answer for her except that he loves and values her and holds her tight as they dance amid their guests all dressed elegantly for the social event
of the season
the view loosens to show the entire night lit party
a cadillac limousine waits for some people inside the tacky las vegas marriage mill
some quiet informally dressed couples wait in the rear of the chapel some talking others sitting nervously
a single organ plays some standard wedding music
the view pans up to the altar where connie and merle in the same clothing they wore to the tahoe party are being married by a justice of the peace
the justice goes through the bored simple ceremony and we begin to hear an echo of the waltz connie danced with her father when she was married all those years
ago in long island
a dark car pulls up to the glitter of the neon facade
albert neri alone leaves it to the parking valets and moves quickly through the automatic doors into the main casino
we still hear the corleone waltz
albert neri enters the room glances around a moment and then heads toward the crap table where a short middle aged man klingman stands by the pit boss
several security guards of the casino are at their posts
are you klingman
where can we talk
i represent the interests of the corleone family
we make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by monday morning
who do you think youre talking to
you said you were klingman
you dont come in here talk to an owner in las vegas like that
you missed my point you are no longer an owner
get out of my hotel
neri stands in front of him smiling
boys get him out of here
quickly neri moves toward klingman and slaps him hard several times in the face knocking off his glasses
red faced klingman gets down on his knees to pick them up once again
glasses on he looks to his guards
they stand motionless
humiliated klingman moves across the casino floor past a few interested gamblers and his own people
neri slowly follows
a typical lido de paris type of show is in rehearsal as klingman backs into the showroom
neri keeps coming
realizes that no one will help him
he finally capitulates
all right ill be out
neri keeps moving then heads past the terrified man sits down at a table and looks up at the stage
to the staring performers keep it going
the neon lights that spell out freds pizzeria go out after a moment a man in an overcoat steps out and turns to lock the door of his restaurant
the corleone waltz continues over this
fred vincent whom we remember as the sicilian fabrizzio
he moves toward his parked car
the starter turns and the automobile blows in a great explosion
the waltz continues over the view of the empty but still illuminated pavilion
there is the debris of the great party spread over the grounds which a silent crew of workmen are at work cleaning up michael walks alone followed by two of
the family dogs irish setters
he walks to the water line and looks out across the lake
he picks up a stick and throws it for the dogs who go scampering after it
we notice that a respectful distance away there are bodyguards watching every move he makes
looking across the lake
there is much on his mind
the sound of the waltz begins to segue into the echoed music and laughter of an old italian music hall from the past
vito corleone is a shy young man of holding his hat in his hand being led down the crowded aisle of this italian vaudeville theatre by an energetic and fulfilled
genco abbandando his friend in america
this entire sequence is played in sicilian
come on youve got to see her
a tattered melodrama is in progress in neapolitan
the sets are two dimensional and flap whenever theres an entrance or exit
the hero peppino is weeping as he sings about how hes left his mother in italy while he is in this new country america
all poor italo americans
genco finds a few seats and leads vito to them stepping on a few shoes in the process
they have barely come to their seats when an excited genco nudges vito and points to the stage
people shout that they should sit down
there is a knock on the door and a young girl enters delivering a letter to peppino in his tenement in america
the girl is pretty and obviously the object of gencos affection
the letter brings bad news
peppinos mother is dead
he weeps and sings the final song which most of the audience knows senza mamma
genco is enthralled with the young actress
the people in the audience are singing along with peppino
the actress object of gencos affection makes a dramatic exit
genco pulls on vitos jacket indicating that now that his love is offstage they should leave
vito rises with him and they make their way all the way down the aisle
genco hurrying down the backstage corridor hoping to catch a glimpse of the actress
he is followed by vito
suddenly genco stops short
a heavy set fierce looking italian wearing an expensive light colored suit and a cream colored fedora
this is fanucci
he is discussing a business matter with the theatre impresario a large strong looking man who is sweating nonetheless
he doesnt seem to be giving in to fanucci
he holds a locked strongbox
the two men argue in italian
the young actress crosses into the area unaware of the difficulties
the impresario sees her and frightened motions that she should keep away
but fanucci grabs her easily by her slender wrist and with lightning speed produces a knife which he holds against her cheek
the impresario wrings his hands in agony
please not my daughter
whereupon he begins to unlock the box which holds the receipts for the nights box office
at first genco is enraged as though he would rush up to help his enamorata
sicilian the black hand
then he backs away
vito looks at him shocked and disappointed in this cowardly behavior
genco shakes his head and points as though to say that where fanucci is concerned there is nothing to be done
sicilian whispered lets get out of here
has released the girl
her father pulls her away from him and slaps her for no reason then he pays fanucci
sicilian because you protested it will cost a hundred more
genco and vito genco leans against the wall breathlessly as though hes had a near escape
sicilian i know what you are thinking vitone but you dont understand yet how things are
fanucci is of the black hand
everyone in the neighborhood pays him even my father
sicilian hes an italian
sicilian a pig of a neaponitan
spits sicilian why
why does he bother other italians
sicilian because he knows them he knows they have no one to protect them
what do you think of my angel
for you she is beautiful
for me there is only my wife
thats why i brought you with me
genco embraces his good friend and they laughingly walk down the alley
the stage door opens and fanucci exits a sinister figure in white moving down the alley just in front of them into the night
the two friends hold their breath until he disappears
vito moves through the street carrying groceries that he is to deliver
it is cold and so vendors are huddled around fires they have lit in old cans and drums
he turns up an alleyway and then stops
with great strength fanucci lifts one of them up into the air and throws him down hard to the concrete but another holding onto his back manages to produce a
switchblade knife and awkwardly reaching around from behind the moving man slits fanuccis throat from one side to the other
fanucci groans like some great hurt animal
blood pours from the deep smile like slit in his throat
he throws the young man off his back
stepping back in the alley
he takes off his white fedora and runs down the alley toward vito catching the flowing blood in his hat
the young attackers scurry off in various directions
a tiny shop featuring imported food trays of cured meats prosciutto copagole mortadella lies on the counter covered with netting to keep away the thousands of flies
olive oil is sold in bulk as well as wine cheese and bacala
genco works here for his father and is busy slicing paper thin prosciutto for a customer by hand
vito works in the back as a stock clerk
finished with his customer genco moves to his friend
sicilian i bet you cant guess what happened
sicilian some guys from ninth avenue jumped fanucci today slit his throat from ear to ear
sicilian no i didnt know
is he dead
those guys arent murderers
they wanted to scare him thats all
make him look bad
sicilian in sicily when you attack a man you had better finish him
sicilian i wish they had
he takes fifty dollars a week from my fathers cash drawer
but you cant kill a man like fanucci
sicilian because hes what we say
you wait see what happens to those guys from ninth avenue
a customer enters and genco moves away to serve him
recalling what he had seen and thought
a young man one of those who had tried to kill fanucci runs down an alleyway breathlessly
then he stops and looks behind himself
whoever was following him is gone
he turns and walks ahead
then the mammoth white suited figure of fanucci leaps down before him from the fire escape
he grins at the young man and then raises his neck showing the gruesome wound that marks his throat
he takes out his pistol and fires point blank at his attacker
the very small railroad type flat where vito lives with his new family
it is late at night and he is exhausted
he returns home where his young wife carmella goes through the silent ritual of preparing a simple meal for him
he sits and eats quietly
vito and carmella enter the darkened bedroom and approach a metal crib
vito reaches down and takes the small hand of the baby between his thick peasant fingers
carmella waits a respectful distance behind him
the shop bell rings singer abbandando turns to see a smiling fanucci tipping his hat like an old customer
immediately vito turns back to his work and signor abbandando moves to fanucci with a sigh
vito notices the two men talking quietly at one side of the store while he goes about his work
genco works his way closer to his friend
sicilian what did i tell you
the one who cut him was found in an alley
and the family of the others paid fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance
sicilian surprised and he agreed
sicilian he took the money
now he wants double from everybody in the neighborhood including papa
vito watches the heated but inevitable transaction
sicilian almost to himself a real mafioso doesnt sell his vengeance
signor abbandando seems to be arguing with fanucci and every so often they turn and relate to where vito is working
then fanucci leaves the little bell ringing and signor abbandando reluctantly moves to vito
how is your son
sicilian we are all well
it is clear that he has something difficult to tell the young man
fanucci has a nephew
vito looks at him a while as the old man struggles to tell him
sicilian and you must give him my job
the old man nods regretfully
sicilian you have been kind to me since i was a boy taken care of me and been as a father
i will always be grateful to you
vito takes off his apron and leaves passing the youth who loiters by the counter
making his way from the store
he turns and abbandando has followed him out of the shop holding a basket of some groceries
for your family
i cannot accept
vito and his wife sit quietly at the table the two are quiet and sad
suddenly we hear a noise and vito is astonished to see a young man peter clemenza leaning out of the window on the other side of the air shaft which
separates their apartments
hold this for me until i ask for it
automatically vito reaches over to the empty space at the air shaft and takes the bundle of rags
clemenzas round face is strained and urgent obviously in some kind of trouble
suddenly he closes the window and there is activity that we cannot see in the other apartment
vito looks to his wife and then closes the window and window dressing and takes the bundle into a private part of his kitchen and begins to unwrap it
five oily guns
he immediately wraps them again and carries them to a private closet and hides it and returns to his wife
he sits down back at the table and she knows not to ask him what has happened
vito is walking through the crowded streets with a group of workmen they all wear work clothes and paper hats on their heads
vito looks to his left and realizes that clemenza is walking silently with him by contrast clemenza dresses well
sicilian casually do you have my goods still
sicilian did you look inside
vito his face impassive shakes his head no
sicilian im not interested in things that dont concern me
vito and clemenza drinking wine theyve become friends
sicilian i have a friend who has a fine rug
maybe your wife would like it
sicilian we have no money for a rug
he would give it away
i know how to repay a consideration
vito thinks then nods
sicilian she would like it
the two men proceed up the hallway vito is impressed with the opulence
sicilian your friend lives in a fine building
sicilian oh yes the very best
clemenza knocks on the door as though he is well known here then rings
sicilian ah hes not at home
oh well he wouldnt mind
quickly and expertly he takes out a tool and pries open the door
vito looks in awe at the luxurious apartment which features a fabulous rich red wool rug
clemenza immediately moves some of the furniture away and drops to the floor
a little help
vito joins him and the two begin rolling the rug
we hear a buzzer ring
clemenza immediately drops his side of the roll and moves to the window
he pulls a gun from his jacket
view on vito watching
he moves so he can see out the window
a policeman stands at the exterior door waiting
he rings the buzzer again
cocking his gun
vito realizes that if the policeman should pursue it any further he is a dead man
the policeman gives up and leaves
clemenza puts away his gun
the two men run up the steps laughing carrying the fine rug
they are on their knees cutting the rug to fit the small room
carmella watches holding the baby santino
like a professional cutting quickly with the proper tools
he sings as he works
clemenza knocks on the steel door of this downtown building
vito waits with him holding some packages and another youth tessio tall and thin and deadly waits with them
the door is lifted and they are greeted by a bright middle aged italian named augustino who leads them into a machine shop
sicilian good you waited for us
clemenza looks up on a higher level
there is a nine year old boy operating a drill press
sicilian who is he
sicilian my son carmine
its all right
the men then quickly open the packages theyve brought revealing gun including a more sophisticated machine weapon
augustino takes them and expertly begins to clean and prepare them
sicilian to vito paisan augustino was a gunsmith in the italian army
we do each other favors
sicilian while he works my boy is studying the flute
he plays very well
he helps me at night so we can buy him a silver flute someday
now he has one made of wood
play for my friends
he shuts off the press and takes out a shabby wooden flute
and begins to play a simple and pure melody
proudly smiling as he prepares the machine gun
the men listening as the boys father prepares their guns
tessio and clemenza quickly load racks of cheap dresses
vito sits behind the wheel of the truck
he seems reserved and we get the impression that he is studying every move his two friends are making
clemenza runs up a flight of stairs with an armful of dresses
he knocks on a door and a pretty housewife answers
sicilian lady i got a bargain on these dresses
five dollars each
you gotta pay at least fifteen maybe twenty in a store
look at them first class
he holds the dresses up and the woman seems interested
she handles a couple of them and stands aside so clemenza can enter her apartment
sicilian i dont know which one i like best
she holds the dresses against her body clemenza approving of each one and then she goes to her purse and takes out five singles and gives them to him
sicilian youd look beautiful in all of these
you should buy at least two
sicilian are you kidding
my husband will kill me if he knows i paid five dollars for one dress
she holds one up then another
she is torn
clemenza shakes his head and straightens the dress on her body
his hand brushes her arm she looks at him smiling
sicilian you can have two for five
she smiles back
clemenza jumps down the stairs and out to the middle of the street where vito and tessio are waiting in the car with some of the stock
sicilian what took so long
sicilian she couldnt decide
tessio and clemenza each take more armsful of dresses and divide the neighborhood
sicilian vito take the rest of the stock over to dandines warehouse hell move it to a wholesaler
the three part
vito drives the truck off
vito drives the truck through the downtown streets he turns a corner and stops for a light
suddenly to his left he sees the formidable figure of fanucci
he grabs young corleone by the shoulder
frightening revealing the large circular scar now healed
sicilian ahhh young fellow
people tell me youre rich you and your two friends
yet you dont show enough respect to send a few dresses to my home
you know i have three daughters
vito says nothing
fanucci thumbs through the stock
sicilian this is my neighborhood
you and your friends have to show me a little respect ah
this truck you hijacked was in my neighborhood
you should let me wet my beak a little
fanucci takes a few of the dresses
sicilian i understand each of you cleared around six hundred dollars
i expect two hundred dollars for my protection and ill forget the insult
after all young people dont know the courtesies due a man like myself
vito smiles at him and nods
sicilian otherwise the police will come to see you and your wife and children will be dishonored and destitute
of course if my information as to your gains is incorrect ill dip my beak just a little
just a little but no less than one hundred dollars and dont try to deceive me eh paisan
sicilian quietly my two friends have my share of the money
ill have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler
sicilian you tell your friends i expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner
dont be afraid to tell them
clemenza and i know each other well he understands these things
let yourself be guided by him
he has more experience in these matters
sicilian shrugging innocently you must understand this is all new to me
sicilian i understand
sicilian but thank you for speaking to me as a godfather
sicilian impressed youre a good fellow
he takes vitos hands and clasps them in his own
sicilian you have respect
a fine thing in the young
next time speak to me first eh
perhaps i can help you make your plans
fanucci turns with the dresses draped over his arms waving to vito
vito throws the truck in gear and drives off
we know that throughout this encounter he has seethed with an icy rage
he wife serves a dinner for her husband and his two friends
they discuss fanucci as they eat
sicilian do you think hed be satisfied with the two hundred dollars
i think he would
sicilian that scar faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler
he wont take a dime less than three hundred dollars
sicilian what if we dont pay
sicilian gestures its hopeless you know his friends
and his connections with the police
sure hed like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude
then they would owe him a favor thats how he operates
well have to pay
three hundred are we agreed
sicilian what can we do
clemenza doesnt even bother checking for vitos opinion
sicilian they say fanucci has a license from maranzalla himself to work this neighborhood
sicilian if you like why not give me fifty dollars each to pay fanucci
i guarantee he will accept that amount from me
sicilian when fanucci says two hundred he means two hundred
you cant talk with him
sicilian ill reason with him
leave everything in my hands
ill settle this problem to your satisfaction
tessio and clemenza regard him suspiciously
sicilian i never lie to people ive accepted as my friends
speak to fanucci yourself tomorrow
let him ask you for the money but dont pay it and dont in any way quarrel with him
tell him you have to get the money and will send me as your messenger
let him understand that youre willing to pay what he asks dont bargain
ill go to his house and quarrel with him
he likes me enjoys explaining how things are here
he uses ten sentences when he only needs one so while he talks ill kill him
clemenza irritated makes a large belch and washes his food down with wine
to tessio our driver has drunk too much wine
sicilian laughs at himself hes going to kill fanucci
sicilian stern then after that what
joe little knife pisani willie bufalino maybe mr
maranzalla himself cmon
sicilian fanucci is not connected he is alone
sicilian sarcastically what
you read it in the papers
sicilian this man informs to the police this man allows his vengeance to be bought off
no he is alone
sicilian if youre wrong
sicilian if im wrong they will kill me
both clemenza and tessio are impressed with their young friend his willingness to risk his life on his perception of the situation
a ten piece italian street band plays in front of the church to commemorate the first night of the festa di san gennaro
people swarm in crowds delighted by the music as out of the church four men carry the statue of san gennaro down to the street
clemenza moves along the booths that have been set up along the street sausage cooking on an open fire pork livers and sweetbeards
he stops for a sandwich and makes an irritated gesture when the vendor expects to be paid
he crosses to a church sponsored booth with a great wheel of fortune and slaps a dollar on a number
standing next to him is vito they embrace
sicilian quietly all three daughters are at church he is alone
its important that you let his neighbors see you leave
tessio has broken the latch on the skylight of his building
the wheel stops they both lose
english see brother carmello even the church makes numbers
english its only the way we collect thats different
vito has left while clemenza jokes with the priest
vito passes the booths of food crossing toward a small and dark club
we can still hear the crowds and music of the festa
vito enters the club is empty except for the large white figure sitting alone at a small table
fanucci barely acknowledges vito as he joins him
without a word vito counts out two hundred dollars on the table
fanucci looks then takes off his fedora and puts it on the table over the money
sicilian i think theres only two hundred dollars under my hat
he peeks im right
only two hundred dollars
sicilian im a little short
ive been out of work
let me owe you the money for a few weeks
sicilian ah youre a sharp young fellow
how is it ive never noticed you before he takes the two hundred and pours some wine for vito youre too quiet for your own interest
i could find some work for you to do that would be very profitable
he rises no hard feelings eh
if i can ever do you a service let me know
youve done a good job for yourself tonight
by now the musicians have left but still families are walking the street and stopping at the booths
fanucci stands there a moment he is known by everyone and considers himself highly loved
then fanucci begins the walk through the festa on his way home
vito silently moves along the rooftop paralleling fanuccis walk
we hear the sounds of the festa and every so often catch a glimpse of the patterned lights and the crowds below
walking through the crowded streets
the statue of san gennaro is arranged in some midnight religious ceremony
the view lifts up to the rooftops
vito makes the leap that separates two buildings then crosses toward the large skylight in the center of the building
the procession in the streets is preceded by ten altar boys and the glittering monstrance something of an altar carried out into the streets
the priest begins this nocturnal service as the crowds in the street kneel down in prayer
fanucci unlocks the door to his building we can hear the services in the background
vito tries the trap door on the roof it is stuck firmly shut despite clemenzas instructions
he struggles with it but no luck
from the distance the choir begins to latin
vito moves around the skylight to an identical trap tries this one it opens
performing the services in latin
the ten altar boys are in attendance
vito reaches down into the trap and pulls out the newly oiled gun that has been left for him
he slides down into the building
fanucci proceeds up the staircase with loud heavy steps
an old woman on one of the flights sees him and immediately moves to her apartment
sicilian whats the matter signora
you dont say good evening
sicilian good evening signor fanucci
she quickly disappears behind her door
fanucci laughs continues up singing to himself
the mass outside is always in evidence
vito climbs down from the attic and finds fanuccis rear door open
he slips in and makes his way past the open windows out of which pour the music and chanting of the mass
slowly and quietly he pulls them down shut
he moves quietly to a glass door and peeks out
three young women fanuccis daughters laughing and talking
a slip up
tessio had said they were out
he steps outside to the alley where he can look into the apartment
fanucci opens the door of his apartment and enters
he begins to wrap the gun
their father greets them with a kiss and a little religious gift he has bought for each
wrapped in this primitive method of a silencer
the view tilts to vito caught in the dilemma of having to kill all or none of them
then something catches his eye
a small gray alley cat is attracted to the young man comes up to him and rubs itself against him
vito rubs the animal speaking softly in sicilian then gaining its confidence lifts it up and carefully lets it into fanuccis apartment
he steps back holding the gun
we hear some italian shouted in the house a loud sound from the cat and some of the thumping footsteps of fanucci
holding the wrapped gun waiting
the white blob of fanucci opening the door and cursing in italian as he throws the cat out
squeezing the trigger the muffled but still loud blast resounding in the building
he holds onto the door frame trying to stand erect trying to reach for his gun
the force of his struggle has torn the buttons off his jacket and made it swing loose
his gun is exposed but so is a spidery vein on the white shirtfront of his stomach
carefully as if plunging a needle into this vein vito corleone fires a second bullet
fanucci falls to his knees propping the door open giving a terrible groan
we begin to hear the voices of girls inside the apartment
vito quickly opens his wallet removes the two hundred quickly fires one last bullet into fanuccis sweaty cheek
now the towel the gun was wrapped with catches fire literally on vitos hand quickly he throws it to the ground stamps it out
and disappears upward
vito moves like a cat along the rooftops we hear the conclusion of the mass down below
pausing we can see the great spectacle of lights and candles on the streets below
he empties the gun of bullets and smashes the barrel against the side of the roof ledge
he reverses it in his hand and breaks the butt into two separate halves against the chimney
he smashes it again and the pistol breaks into barrel and handle two separate pieces
he then moves along the rooftop dropping the two separate fragments into various air shafts
the priest having completed the ceremony follows as the monstrance is carried off through the streets as the choir sings
vito is a dark figure moving with agility across the rooftops
the corpse that was fanucci stained with blood
the statue of san gennaro followed by the altar boys
vitos wife her baby and several friends and neighbors sit happily on the front stoop of their tenement
some of the men drink wine poured out of a pitcher we can still hear the music and night sounds of the festa
a neighbor is singing a neapolitan song
quietly without a word and with only a momentary glance from his wife vito joins the little group takes a glass of wine and listens to the song
listening to the song
he reaches out and takes the small hand of his son
sicilian santino your papa loves you
the room is large lit from the outside by a bright evening
we can see the outline of many toys on the shelves built along the wall
we see the dark figure of michael corleone enter the room and approach the bed where his son anthony lies curled in messy blankets
michael quietly arranges his small hands and feet and covers the little boy
suddenly anthony turns his eyes open
he is staring perfectly awake at his father
cant you sleep
are you alright
did you like your party
i got lots of presents
do you like them
i didnt know the people who gave them to me
they were friends
he kisses his boy and then turns
did you see my present for you
no where is it
on your pillow
im leaving very early tomorrow before you wake up
how long will you be gone
just a few days
will you take me
why do you have to go
to do business
i can help you
some day you will
michael kisses him again
the room is lit from a small night lamp on michaels side of the large bed
kay is huddled in blankets asleep
michael closes the door to his room moves to his side of the bed and glances down to the pillow
is a childs drawing of a long limousine with a man in a hat sitting in the back seat
an arrow pointing to him is marked dad
under it a nine year olds handwriting says do you like it
check yes i liked it or no i didnt like it
michael turns looking for a pencil and moves to the dresser where he places a check next to yes
he starts to cross back toward his side of the bed when kay turns almost in her sleep michael
why are the drapes open
his eyes dart back to the curved beautifully leaded windows of the room
the drapes are opened
then without a seconds hesitation he leaps to the floor still holding his sons drawing as a spray of machine gun bullets sweep across the windows glass shattering all over
kay screams out rising still half asleep
michael crawls toward her and pulls her down to the floor to him
then for a moment there is silence soon filled by the shouts of men as flashes of light sweep by the window as guards with flashlights come running
michael holds kay to him knowing they have both survived and then gently go with the kids
suddenly the great floodlights are turned on bathing lawns in an intense blue light
groups of ordinarily dressed security men drawn in from all directions a state of confusion prevails
there is no sign of the attackers
michael is joined by rocco lampone his gun drawn
theyre still on the property
maybe you better stay inside
keep them alive
six men take up posts by michaels house
he returns inside
the character of the summer estate has changed bright floodlights illuminate the main points of entry the main gate the waterway the stone wall that encompasses the estate on all
several men with flashlights reinforce the guard at the main gate
off in the distance we see another group of men with flashlights combing the waterline
we hear indistinguishable shouts
the wire gates are opened and the trained dogs go out yelping into the outer edge of the estate
one of roccos men turns the large floodlight scanning darkened forest areas where men could hide
men with flashlights and dogs
moving through the dark areas
a small corleone launch with a bright spotlight slowly cruises the boundaries of the estate
we see the silhouette of men with guns quietly waiting and watching
some of the bodyguards by the shattered windows of michaels bedroom
the curtains are drawn from inside
kay the children and some women servants have come down from the various rooms into the central living area that can be most easily secured
the little girl is still asleep they make you think of an immigrant family with their blankets and frightened faces all waiting in a central room
michael goes up to kay squeezes her hand and whispers it will be all right
we were lucky
she says nothing but her face expresses the anger she feels over the jeopardy michael has placed his children in
she holds her young daughter in her arms
the door opens and rocco enters
he quickly realizes he is holding his gun in plain view in front of the family and puts it away
michael moves to him and they talk a distance away from kay
your family all seem to be okay in the other houses your mothers still sleeping
no sign of them yet but theyre still on the estate
we hear loud shouting from outside
youre all nuts here im not goin to calm down
through the door that rocco opens
deanna in her nightgown has been frightened by the gunshots while fredo in his bathrobe tries to get her back into the house
deanna will you get back into the house
im getting out of here i said these guys all have guns
fredo cant you shut that woman up
to roccos men get her in here
the bodyguards gracefully help fredo bring the hysterical deanna into the safety of the house
whimpering i dont want to stay here
mike what can i do shes a hysterical woman
leave her alone
youre talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard
to rocco have tom hagen meet me in the harbor house
michael walks the short distance from his house to the boathouse where he conducts his business away from his family
a small group of bodyguards carrying machine guns make the walk with him from all sides a respectful distance away
it gives the appearance of a lonely president moving in his compound followed by teams of secret service men
the boathouse is already secured by teams of men hastily wakened from their lodge house a barracks like structure where reinforcements are lodged just for this kind of emergency
in the distance we can see the teams of men and dogs with their lights guns and shouts combing every inch of the estate
michael alone in the great room
he moves to a walk in safe quickly runs through the combination and opens it
he takes out an envelope and puts it into his pocket theres a knock on the door and hagen enters
he had been asleep and has quickly thrown on a robe
sit down tom
from outside the leaded windows a disoriented hagen sits down michael starts to talk to him obviously about something very serious
the patrol securing the boathouse walk past the window
michael says something to tom who rises and pulls the drapes obscuring our view
michael talks intimately to tom
theres a lot i cant tell you tom
i know thats upset you in the past and youve felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence
but it is because i do trust you that ive kept so much secret from you
its precisely that at this moment you are the only one that i can completely trust
in time youll understand everything
nods with this statement but your people
rocco you dont think
no i have confidence in their loyalty
but this is life and death and tom you are my brother
hagen in very moved
mikey i hoped
no tom just listen
all my people are businessmen their loyalty is based on that
one thing i learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think
and on that basis anything is possible
fredo has a good heart but he is weak
and stupid and stupid people are the most dangerous of all
ive kept you out of things tom because ive always known that your instincts were legitimate and i wanted you to know very little of things that would make you
an accomplice for your own protection
i never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under sonny i know you were in a position of limited power and you did your best to advise and
what i am saying is that now for how long i do not know you will be the don
if what i think has happened is true i will leave tonight and absolutely no one will know how to contact me
and even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary
i give you complete power over neri
i am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children and the future of this family solely resting on your judgment and talent
a man who has steadily declined over the last five years realizing that total power and responsibility is being placed on him
continuing but tom you must know that i do this only because i believe you are the only one who is capable of taking over for me
taking out the envelope
ive prepared this have had it for over a month
it wont explain everything but indicates where i will be so in a sense it is my life
he hands the envelope to hagen also there are three tasks that must be executed immediately
pop would have given those to luca you knew pop as well as anyone act as though you were him
it discusses kay as well that will be the most difficult
the men who tried to kill me tonight will never leave the estate
be able to get who ordered it out of them
i dont think so
unless im very wrong
theyre already dead
killed by someone inside
very frightened that they botched it
thats why i am going to disappear in a few minutes and leave everything to you
but if youre wrong
if im wrong
there is a knock on the door
i dont think im wrong
he indicates the knock yes
the door opens it is rocco michael rises after making a knowing glance toward tom and moves to talk quietly to a frightened and agitated rocco
a group of men with flashlights and guns lead michael tom and rocco to the stone bridge spanning the stream which runs through the estate
michaels dispassionate face looking down
the view moves to hagens and then down to the murky water under the bridge where we see the bodies of three strangers lying in the moving water machine type
guns nearby with their throats cut
light from the many flashlights illuminates the grotesque scene
fish them out
several of the men wade down into the stream rocco helps and even tom steps down to get a better look at who they were
they are total strangers rocco examines the type of guns they used
when they climb back onto the ground michael is gone
everyone notices it but no one says anything
hagen stands there holding the envelope michael had given him in his hand
he realizes that now he is the don
get rid of the bodies
tomorrow morning i want a report made to the local police and paper that some explosives we keep on the property were accidentally ignited
the men respond hagen makes the lonely walk back to the lighted section of the compound which now resembles a prison camp
the senate is in session senator geary is on the floor during a vote
an aide approaches him with a slip of paper
the senator steps behind his desk
all right mr
hagen youve got ten minutes
he flicks the switch of a small tape recorder
and the tape will be running
actually ive come with good news the corleone family has done you a favor
the senator immediately shuts the tape recorder off
what the hell are you talking about
we know youre a busy man with plenty of enemies we saw the opportunity to do you a favor and we did
you know theres a senate investigating committee recently set up we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though provoking to your name
no one can trace anything to me i pride myself on that
do you gamble
a little whats so thought provoking about that
do you owe markers
maybe two three thousand dollars
hagen leans forward and deposits a handful of paper on the senators desk
the corleone family has paid them off for you
as an expression of our esteem
geary quickly looks through the paid markers
theres thirty grand worth of paid off markers i never owed that much
but what does it matter it was our money
rising we dont even expect thanks
you paid off thirty grand i never owed
well keep it quiet the people who know are trustworthy
the committee neednt find out
and whats the price of their not finding out
be friendly like us
he despises hagen thanks
there are more men on duty than usual not that there are guns apparent but its clear that the boundaries are being patrolled
kay exits her house followed by her children she helps them into her station wagon like any housewife and drives along the path leading to the main gate
shes about to drive through when one of the men steps in front of her raising his hand
im sorry mrs
were not to let you through
disbelieving im going to the market
if you could just give us a list well pick up anything you want
whose orders are these
we notice hagen walking to them in the background
hagen approaches the car kay gets out so they can talk away from the children
i wanted to explain this myself
i had business in carson city
he walks with her a little way from the others the children run out of the station wagon and start to play
its michaels request
for your safety
we can send out for anything you need
im supposed to stay in my house
within the compound will be fine
i was supposed to take the children to new england next week
thats off now
im going to see my parents
kay michael didnt tell me a lot and what he did tell me i cant repeat
but the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with
how long does this go on
i dont know
pause im sorry kay
am i a prisoner
thats not the way we look at it
angrily without another word kay turns away from him and walks to her children ignoring the running station wagon
the luxury liner making its way across the atlantic
the purser followed by several white uniformed associates knocks on the door of something designated the leonardo suite
he is holding a telegram
the door opens and a tanned merle peeks out of the door
holding up the telegram im terribly sorry to disturb you but we have received two telegrams
this entourage enters the suite an impressive and beautifully spacious luxury suite
connie is relaxing
what is it
one is from our office in new york
the check that you wrote for your passage has been returned
why dont you wire your bank
the other telegram is from your bank
your account has been closed and the company is warned not to extend any credit
ill take care of it in naples
the company hopes so
but for now we have orders to change your accommodations
and with that the men in white begin to pack connie and merles luggage
that son of a bitch
connie and merle are attempting to sleep in the miniature cabin in bunk beds
the little space is crowded with their trunks and luggage
merle can barely hang onto the bunk the boat pitches so violently below
a train speeds across the countryside
inside the corridor a porter advances and knocks on the door of a stateroom
a voice tells him to enter
our view enters with him as he carries a tray of lunch
from this pov we see michael corleone sitting in the compartment
you ordered lunch
put it right there
the porter does so as he places the tray down he catches a glimpse of a second person in the compartment with michael
a very fierce almost maniacal looking man bussetta
he nods that the porter should leave
the porter takes his advice and leaves quickly closing the door behind him
michael and his mysterious companion have lunch together on the moving train
the empty parking lot of the gulfstream track on an off race day
michael sits behind the wheel of a nondescript late model car
bussetta sits in the rear
another car swings into the lot
michael starts his car and pulls out of the lot the second car following
this car pulls out and begins to follow them
michael glances back by adjusting the rear view mirror and nods to bussetta
michaels car begins to slow down allowing the other car to overtake them
the overtaking car hesitates a moment moving side by side with them
michael glances toward the driver
we recognize johnny ola who waves a greeting to michael and then continues on to lead him
olas car leads michaels through a middle class suburban area of to homes
there are small channels with sporting and fishing boats parked near the houses
olas car pulls up in front of a very simple tract type home
michaels car parks nearby
sicilian to bussetta youll wait in the car
ola has gotten out of his car and walks up the little path to the front door
ola rings the bell and after a moment a rather pretty middle aged woman answers remaining behind the screen door
ola says a few things to her and she disappears leaving the door open
ola comes down the steps looks at michael nodding to him
ola then gets into his car and drives off
michael walks up the walkway and enters the little house closing the door behind him
this woman terri roth is in the kitchen looking out at michael
im just going to make lunch
how about a tuna fish sandwich
thank you mrs
she hurries halfway up the staircase
hyman your friend is here
turning to michael why dont you go right upstairs mr
he continues upstairs she goes into the kitchen
ill give a yell when lunch is ready
michael continues up to a small den on the second floor we can hear the sound of a baseball game coming over the television
michael enters the den its very comfortable but somewhat like a senior citizens retirement home in florida
there sitting before the television is a small man in his middle sixties thin with a wizened face looking like a small time retired jewish businessman
this is hyman roth
sit down this is almost over
you follow the baseball games
not for a few years
i like sporting events i really enjoy watching them in the afternoon
one of the things i love about this country
i loved baseball ever since arnold rothstein fixed the world series of
i heard you had some trouble
what a mistake people behaving like that with guns
he shakes his head it was my understanding we left all that behind
but let me tell you the important thing is that youre all right
good health is the most important thing more than success more than power more than money
the incident of the other night is a nuisance that i can take care of
i came to you because i want nothing to affect our agreement i wanted to clear everything im going to do with you just in case
youre a considerate young man
youre a great man mr
roth i have much to learn from you
warmly however i can help you
the rosato brothers have performed services for you in the past i understand that they are under your protection
simply we do favors for each other
technically they are still under the clemenza wing of the corleone family now run by frankie pentangeli
after clemenza died the rosatos wanted territory of their own
pentangeli refused and came to me asking for permission to eliminate them
i of course knew of their relationship with you and in gratitude for your help with the tropicana matter turned him down
pentangeli was furious and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed
i was lucky and he was stupid
ill visit him soon
leaning toward the old man sincerely the important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans yours and mine
this thing of ours that we will build
the old man touches michaels hand warmly
nothing is more important
quietly pentangeli is a dead man do you object
its always bad for business but you have no choice
then its done
i must choose his replacement it cannot be rosato
of course you must keep control of your family
he turns to michael turning the volume higher on the television and moving closer to his young partner
michael these things are unimportant
who should be the manager of a dime store joe or jack
you do what you think is right
youre a young man and im old and sick
what we do together in the next few months will be history michael it has never been done before
we will do this historical thing together and even your father could never dream it would be possible
we are bigger than u
steel you and me
because in america anything is possible
pause but soon i will be dead and it will all belong to you
there is a knock on the door and terri roth pushes the door open with her hip
my goodness youll rupture your eardrums hyman
she puts the tray down and turns down the television
the sinister bussetta waits patiently in the rear seat of the car outside roths modest house
a black cadillac moves down the street slowed by the festivities of the festa that is in progress people milling around buying souvenirs at the many stands set up
sausage and grilled meats are prepared just as they were years ago
electric lights are strung from the street lamps and brightly colored banners pronounce the festa of the madonna
willy cicci drives frustrated that he cannot go any faster
next to him frankie pentangeli sits catching a few seconds snooze
the black car pulls up another car that had been following it parks nearby
one of pentangelis button men gets out of the car and steps into a small italian restaurant he exits quickly and nods affirmatively toward pentangelis cadillac
the group of them step out quickly men huddled around pentangeli and enter the restaurant
the restaurant is quite empty despite the excitement out on the street
pentangeli immediately sits at a table with a tall dark snappily dressed young man carmine rosato
nearby on the other side of the room is rosatos brother tony seated with a group of their men
at another table in the restaurant is a table of pentangelis people they are joined by bodyguards
rosato wheres your brother
sitting right behind you
pentangeli glances behind himself
he dont want to talk
we worked it all out beforehand
are we going to eat or what
sure on me
i got diners club
sarcastically forget it im suddenly without an appetite
youre making big trouble carmine
you werent straight with us frankie what else could we do
we could have talked first saved a lot of running around
you wasnt listening you didnt want to talk
dont i look like im listening
we want brooklyn one hundred percent
no more taxes to you
we want to be only loosely connected with your family sort of a under family all of our own
then we can act on all internal matters without talking
also we want you to inform michael corleone that we can deal directly with him
im a little hungry maybe ill order something
one of his men get me some bracciole or something
and pay cash
to rosato and in return for these concessions what do you do for me
we will release the hostages number one
number two were here for you to count on when you need us
were independent but were here if you need us
in general well cooperate with you and your businesses and you in turn will cooperate with us
pari persu what the fuck is pari persu
my lawyer went over this beforehand
what assurances do i have that there will be no more kidnapping no more hits
the same assurance we got from you
what if i say shove it
then carmine fucillo and tony blue derosa will need to be fitted for slabs
you want a war
we got no choice
you know if theres a way ill go to the commission and the commission will side with me
that puts me and the other new york families against you
we got friends in the commission
getting angry im talking about italians
what about michael corleone
he supports me
one of pentangelis men approaches with a plate of italian food
pentangeli stands up angered by this remark of rosatos he pushes the dish of food out of the surprised bodyguards hands
you drove old pete clemenza to his grave carmine you and your brother
turning on him trouble in his territories you and your demands
i hold you responsible just as though you shot him in the head
and i aint gonna let that go for long
pentangeli walks out of the restaurant theres a little tension between the bodyguards of the two factions
hey five angels
he gives him the arm
frankies face turns red like he wants to have it out here and now but willy cicci calms his down and they all make their move out
pentangeli gets into the car
nobody i hate calls me five angels to my face
he slams the door
part of the old estate of don corleone
by now the wall has been torn down and the other houses sold off
his car is parked pentangeli steps out still angry over the confrontation
as he approaches the house he notices something strained about the bodyguards who discreetly guard his house
no one seems to want to tell him
pentangeli glances over to the front door foyer
the strange and silent bussetta the man who now always travels with michael
pentangeli enters he sees his wife standing oddly in the hallway
sicilian whats this
one michael corleone
sicilian hes in your study
he knows it is very very serious for michael to be here in his home
he automatically moves into his study
michael stands quietly in the room
this was once his fathers study although it is totally redecorated
pentangeli starts sweating and moves toward the young don and kisses his hand
don corleone i wish you let me know you was coming
we could have prepared something for you
i didnt want you to know i was coming
you heard what happened in my home
michael yes we was all relieved
furious in my home
in the same room where my wife was sleeping where my children come in their pajamas and play with their toys
hes terrified pentangeli with his anger then just as suddenly he talks quietly calmly
i want you to help me take my revenge
what is it i can do for you
i want you to settle these troubles with the rosato brothers
i was just going to contact you michael we just had a sit down in fact i just come from there
i want you to settle on their terms
mike i dont understand
dont ask me to do that
trust me do as i ask
it would be the beginning of the end for my family
how can i keep all my other territories in like if i let two wise guys stand up and demand this and that and then give it to them
do you respect me
do i have your loyalty
but sometimes i dont understand
i know ill never have your kind of brains in big deals
but mike this is a street thing
and hyman roth in miami is behind the rosato brothers
then why do you want me to lay down to them
coldly but convincing frankie roth tried to have me killed
im sure it was him but i dont know yet why
jesus christ michael then lets hit em now while we still got the muscle
this was my fathers old study
when i was a kid we had to be quiet when we played near here
when i was older i learned many things from him here
i was happy that this house never went to strangers first clemenza took it over and then you
my father taught me in this room never to act until you know everything thats behind things
if hyman roth sees that i interceded with you in the rosato brothers favor hell think his relationship with me is still sound
im going somewhere to meet him tomorrow
we have friends in some very important business that were making
do this for me you make the peace with the rosato brothers on their terms
let the word out that i forced you youre not happy wit hit but acquiesced just because of me
it will get back to hyman roth
do this frankie
you can trust me
ill go along
they embrace michael kisses him
he looks at the young don thoughtfully
the money trays are carefully unloaded from the gaming tables and put on a cart with others
the cart preceded and followed by security guards is then wheeled through the casino into a private counting room
the guards leave the room the door is locked after them leaving only hagen
neri and an accountant a very fat man
the numbered boxes are opened and cash and checks are spread out on the counting table
the accountant begins with amazing speed and skill to count and divide the money
fifteen percent skim
twenty five this time
the accountant stops and looks up to neri
it might show
mike wants it
neri nods and the accountant continues
neri opens a door allowing a sandy haired man a courier into the room
the cream is placed into his pouch personally by neri
weve never sent this much with one courier
to the courier your plans are a little different this time
you skip miami and go straight to geneva
its to be deposited to this number
handing him a small envelope and its got to be there by monday morning no slip up
i think i was picked up last trip
that hour layover i had at kennedy
i went over and bought a paper
neri has finished putting the creamed money into the pouch
those were our people
okay just thought you should know
he is just about to close and lock the pouch when hagen gestures that he should wait and adds more stacks of carefully packaged bills into the pouch
then neri locks it and handcuffs it to the couriers arm looking inquiringly at hagen
let them count
the courier is shown out through a private door and then the first door is opened
two accountants come in with the guards and the trays are opened and the counting process is begun all over again this time with the state tally sheets
the courier continues on his way followed by hagen and neri
i got to ask questions tom theres three million dollars cash in that pouch mike is gone and i have no word from him
al as far as youre concerned im the don
how do i know you havent gone into business for yourself
this hurts tom but he is a reasonable man and he knows he owes neri some explanation
youve been through a lot with us so im going to give you the truth
mike knows it was someone within the compound that set him up for that hit
so nobody is to know where he is not you not rocco not even his brother fredo
sorry al i know how you feel about mike
but he still remembers tessio
michael is led to a desolate night lit private dock
he is followed by the ever present bussetta and they are helped onto a light weight luxury cabin cruiser
the crew cast off various ropes and the boat sets out into the night
a seaplane lands nicely by the private corleone harbor hagen disembarks with his inevitable overloaded briefcase
he continues down the ramp past several buttonmen dressed in summer casual attire and who resemble secret service men rather than thugs
his wife theresa lies on a blanket on the great lawn with her youngest children who run to their father for a kiss
just a little
ive invited mama sandra and the kids for barbecue
what about kay
i couldnt find her
shes been so broody sticks to herself
hagen and sonnys boys are throwing a football around on the lawn the littler kids running after them
coals are burning in the old style stone barbecue and several tables are set for the family
in the distance there is always evidence of the bodyguards
theresa mama and sandra prepare the steaks
hagen relaxes in a sports shirt
let me try kay
he crosses the lawn to the house on the beach where michael and his family live
is about to knock on the door hey pop heads up
the football is flying in his direction he catches it and throws it back
then he cracks the door open and peeks in
he steps in the beautiful summer living room is neat but empty
he moves through the house more quickly into the dining and recreation room areas
a cat jumps off a pile of cushions and runs across the room
shes gone tom
sandra has followed him into michaels house
what do you mean gone
the barretts from rubicon bay came by in a new speedboat
rocco tried to say she wasnt in but kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride
that was three hours ago
furious why didnt someone tell me
i wanted to tell you alone your wife doesnt know whats going on
hagen rushes out of the house
hagen moves quickly out of michaels house moving across the lawn to the boathouse
this time he ignores the thrown ball and moves directly to rocco who is by some men near the boathouse
i went down to the barrett house
but shes gone
they drove her and the kids to north tahoe airport
goddamn it where were you
i was in my house
willy tried but it would have taken some strong arm to stop her and he figured you wouldnt want that
they enter the boathouse
to one of the men get me a scotch and water
the man hurries behind the bar
she took a flight to san francisco
we figure shes going to connect to new hampshire her parents place
almost to himself i cant let him down
he swallows the drink down in several gulps
and then looks up to his men watching him
hes embarrassed to have shown such weakness
all right let me think a minute
rocco clears the men out
me too tom
yeah give me a minute
rocco gone hagen moves behind the enormous bar and pours himself a giant drink
he drinks that and calms himself
oh christ pop
it was so good when you were alive
i felt i could handle anything
a beautiful coastal view of a tropical caribbean city
an extraordinary view high buildings palm trees all set right on the bay
on the cruiser bussetta a little distance away watching but never speaking
the dark skinned captain of the cruiser keeps pointing repeatedly
michael and bussetta are driven in a mercury sedan making its way through the streets of havana
looking out the window
crowded streets occasional roving bands playing for the tourists there is much evidence of tourism americans walking through the streets with cameras
occasionally we see a cuban with a row of numbers attached to his hat carrying a big sheet of the daily lottery numbers
from all of these street impressions the city is booming with activity but there is also much evidence of whores and pimps and little children begging in the streets
the big american car stops at an intersection
bussetta is sitting in the forward passenger side while michael is in the back
he hears tapping on the window he turns and sees four cuban boys tapping on his window and extending their hands and rubbing their stomachs as though they were hungry
the cuban driver rolls down his window and shouts them away in spanish
michael is led through a beautiful wooden lobby of the hotel done in spanish style apparently just recently completed
he is approached by a thin mousy man sam roth who ushers him toward the casino entrance
corleone im sam roth
welcome to the capri my brothers upstairs
you wanta take a rest before you see him or can i get you something anything at all
no im fine
he leads michael into the main casino
this is it
we think it makes vegas look like the corner crap game
jake jake come over here
mike i want you to meet jake cohen he manages the casino for us
appreciating michaels status mr
sam turns to bussetta and extends his glad hand
pleasure to meet you im sure
he gets no response whatsoever from bussetta
an extremely tall well built cuban tanned and wearing an attractive mustache leon in his middle forties reads from a prepared paper
his sentences are translated by a smaller man standing to his rear
spanish most respected gentlemen allow me to welcome you to the city of havana the republic of cuba on behalf of his excellency fulgencio batista
the view begins to move along the various men gathered for this meeting
id like to thank this distinguished group of american industrialists for continuing to work with cuba for the greatest period of prosperity in her entire history
william proxmiro representing the general fruit company
corngold and dant of the united telephone and telegraph company mr
petty regional vice president of the pan american mining corporation and of course our friend mr
robert allen of south american sugar
nash of the american state department
hyman roth of miami and michael corleone of nevada representing our associates in tourism and leisure activities
leon pauses to take a drink of water
then proudly he lifts a shiny yellow telephone for all to see
the president would like to take this opportunity to thank u t t for their lovely gift a solid gold telephone
he thought all you gentlemen would care to take a look at it
he hands the heavy phone set to one of his aides and it is passed in turn to each of the men in attendance
your excellency perhaps you could discuss the status of rebel activity and how this may affect our businesses
he receives the telephone and glances at it before passing it on to hyman roth
the rebel movement is basically unpopular and since july of has been contained in the oriente province in the mountains of the sierra muestre
michael passes the phone on to roth
continuing we began a highly successful offensive against them in march and activities within the city itself are at a minimum
i can assure you well tolerate no guerrillas in the casinos or swimming pools
general subdued laughter
police are stopping traffic
michaels mercury is among the cars a police officer seeing that some important person is being driven walks up to the driver
he leans forward and says something in spanish to the driver
the driver in turn leans over to michael
he says it will just be a short time and theyll let us through
michael looks out the window
the old building has been totally surrounded by police and military vehicles
right at this moment they are waiting lazily but soldiers are there with automatic weapons ready
there is a momentary commotion inside the building and the men brace up
a captain of the army detachment says something in spanish over a megaphone and his men put their weapons at the ready as other policemen lead a group of civilians
out of the building with their hands up
they are moved over to some military truck where they are frisked before being loaded
all of a sudden one of the civilian rebels breaks loose and rushes toward the command vehicle
he hurls himself into the vehicle as two police try to pull him out
a second later and there is an explosion the man obviously having hidden a grenade on his body sacrificing his own life to take the life of the captain
there is a commotion but the military quickly quell it
the police rush to michaels car and guide it outside of the trouble area
as they lead and escort the mercury out of the area
some glasses rum is poured into them then coca cola
quarter limes are squeezed
a squeeze of fresh lime
sam prepares the drinks for his brother hyman and a group of men including michael
i was told the cubans now call this drink la mentira
i still dont speak spanish michael
a moments hesitation then a few of the men laugh
now two cubans in white carry a table which has a lovely small cake on it
the cake is here
they all raise their glasses to the old man
ad lib happy birthday
roth glances at the cake and its inscription is pleased
i hope my age is correct i am always accurate about my age
he nods and they begin to cut it put a piece on plates and carry them to the different men
everything weve learned in vegas is true here but we can go further
the bigger the swankier the plusher the store the more a sense of legitimacy and the bigger business we do
looking at the plate brought to him a smaller piece
what weve proposed to the cuban government is that it put up half the cash on a dollar for dollar basis
accepting a smaller piece thank you
we can find people in the united states who will put up our share for a small piece of the action yet we will retain control
a hundred million dollars
but only if this government relaxes its restrictions on importing building materials well need some new laws too but that will be no difficulty
what are import duties now
as much as seventy percent
also im working out an arrangement with the minister of labor so that all our pit bosses stick men and dealers can be considered specialized technicians eligible for two year
as of now theyre only allowed in cuba for six months at a time
in short were in a full partnership with the cuban government
is handed a piece of cake
roth moves over to a folder of documents
continuing here are applications from friends all over the states
i understand santo virgilio in tampa is trying to make his own deal
well the cuban government will brush him off
the lakeville road boys are going to take over the nacionale here
im planning a new hotel casino to be known as riviera
the new capri will go to the corleone family
the cake is sliced and carried to each of the men
then theres the sevilla biltmore the havana hilton which is going to cost twenty four million cuban banks will put up half the teamsters will bankroll the rest
generally there will be friends for all our friends including the lieutenant governor of nevada eddie levine of newport will bring in the pennino brothers dino and eddie theyll handle
actual casino operations
and seeing that all of his friends have been served roth raises his fork
i saw an interesting thing today
a man was being arrested by the military police probably an urban guerrilla
rather than be taken alive he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket taking the command vehicle with him
the various men look up as michael eats his cake wondering what the point of it is
it occurred to me the police are paid to fight and the rebels are not
so that occurred to me
he understands michaels point if the others do not
this country has had rebels for the last fifty years its part of their blood
believe me i know
ive been coming here since the twenties we were running molasses out of havana when you were a baby
to trucks owned by your father
he chuckles warmly over the memory well talk when were alone
and he returns his attention to the men who are gathered with him on his birthday
michael sits alone with the old man on a terrace that overlooks the city
you have to be careful what you say in front of the others
they frighten easy
its always been that way most men frighten easy
were making a big investment in cuba
thats my only concern
my concern is that the three million never arrived at batistas numbered account in switzerland
he thinks its because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels
the money was sent
then you have to trace it
michael people here look at me as a reliable man
i cant afford not to be looked on as a reliable man
but you know all that theres nothing you can learn from me
you shouldnt have to put up with a sick old man as a partner
i wouldnt consider anyone else
except the president of the united states
he laughs slyly as though this is some private joke between them
then his laughter becomes a cough which he painfully stifles with a handkerchief
if only i could live to see it kid to be there with you
how beautifully weve done it step by step
here protected free to make our profits without the justice department the fbi ninety miles away in partnership with a friendly government
ninety miles just a small step looking for a man who desperately wants to be president of the united states and having the cash to make it possible
youll be there to see it youll be there
the telephone has just rung michael listens
we have your call to tahoe nevada sir
click click tom
tom is that you
no toms out of town
this is rocco
who is this
michael is openly disturbed that hagen is not there
he hangs up without answering
tom hagen steps out of a taxicab a bit tentatively and then steps toward the door of a pleasant new england house
he rings the bell and waits hat in hand
a moment later the door opens and kay is standing there
im not surprised to see you tom
out to the yard where we can see glimpses of little anthony playing by himself
i cant love a man like that i cant live with him i cant let him be father to my children
the little boy moodily by himself
hes not like a little boy
he doesnt talk to me he doesnt want to play he doesnt like other children he doesnt like toys
its as though hes waiting for the time he can take his fathers place
almost in tears you know what he told me when he was four years old
he said he had killed his grandfather
he said he had shot his grandfather with a gun and then he died in the garden
and he asked me
he asked me tom if that meant now his father would shoot him out of
she cries how does a four year old boy learn the word
what kind of a family is this
are we human beings
he knows his father killed his uncle carlo
he heard connie
you dont know thats true
but kay just for the sake of an argument lets assume it is im not saying it is remember but
what if i gave you what might be some justification for what he did
or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did
thats the first time ive seen the lawyer side of you tom
its not your best side
okay just hear me out
what if carlo had been paid to help get sonny killed
what if his beating of connie that time was a deliberate plot to get sonny out into the open
and what if the don a great man couldnt bring himself to do what he had to do avenge his sons death by killing his daughters husband
what if that finally was too much for him and he made michael his successor knowing that michael would take that load off his shoulders would take that guilt
hes not the same as when i met him
if he were hed be dead by now
youd be a widow
youd have no problem
what the hell does that mean
come on tom speak out straight once in your life
i know michael cant but youre not sicilian you can tell a woman the truth you can treat her like an equal a fellow human being
there is a long silence
then hagen shakes his head he can tell her no more
if you told michael what ive told you today im a dead man
when is it finally over
i want it to be over before my baby is born
i dont know
i hope soon but its not over yet and thats why you and the kids have to come back to me
he looks at her its clear that he has been entrusted with her safety and her childrens
he is a kind good man and seems very nervous and overwrought
little anthony is pressing his face against the glass pane as though he senses the adults are discussing something of importance to him
the baccarat table
busy hundred dollar bills being played
freddie corleone telephone please
the play is fast pit boss presiding but no sign of fredo
telephone for mr
we see neri ominous presiding over the entire store
he picks up a pit telephone
and hangs up disgustedly fredo is entertaining two showgirls done up in feathers and what have you
cmon you got fifteen minutes before the finale
i want to show you a trick with feathers
phone for you
dont go away wait a minute
he takes the phone we can catch a view of the show going on from the wings
on the phone yeah

jesus three million
i wont let you down
he hangs up thoughtfully
freddie we still got twelve minutes before the finale
some other time
there is a light rain
pentangeli steps out of his car points to willy cicci
wait in the car
he walks up the street to the bar where he is greeted by the tall handsome carmine rosato
they shake hands
pentangeli looks in his hand
rosato has put a crisp one hundred dollar bill in his hand folded sharply in two
thats a lucky c note for our new deal
he puts his arm around pentangeli and they walk into the bar
the bar is fairly empty and very dark
pentangeli and rosato step up to the bar the bartender momentarily stops polishing glasses to pour a couple of drinks
we were all real happy about your decision frankie youre not goin to regret it
he holds up the glass
i dont like the c note
i take it like an insult
suddenly a garrote is thrown around pentangelis throat and he is forcefully yanked back into the shadows all the way into a wooden telephone booth
the folded hundred dollar bill resting on the bar
we see only pentangelis feet and legs struggling
we hear the terrible sounds of a man being strangled
calm and then he sees something that disturbs him
shit your friend the cop
suddenly the side door opens and a shaft of sunlight cuts through the darkness
everything all right in there ritchie
the door was open
pentangelis feet stop moving
just cleaning up
strained voice you okay
is that something on the floor
not here not a cop not here
two figures race through the shadows and race through the doors
shouting to his partner in uniform stutz
watch out stutz
we see that a patrol car had stopped for its routine visit
stutz the second patrolman is just stepping out of his car pentangelis bodyguard seeing the commotion leaps out
three men including rosato rush out
there is gunfire cicci is wounded
the patrolmen is grazed across the face trying to stop the flow of blood with his hand
the three assailants jump into the car and drive off
the stricken pentangeli comes back to life
he can barely move his lips
the dirty bastard he gave me a c note
he gave me a c note
he sees the patrolman leaning over him
the sergeant is on the car radio
frankie pentangeli murder attempt
patrolman stutz shot
sahara lounge utica avenue and claredon road
white cadillac three or four men took off from scene
need ambulance stutz is bad
taking pentangeli into custody
his wizened face pale
right now though his eyes have a sparkle as he watches three million dollars in cold cash being counted on a card table in front of him
his brother sam is present and the sandy haired courier a little nervous the one who had left from the tropicana with the corleone skim money
also johnny ola
the money is evidently all there roth picks up a packet probably a hundred thousand dollars and throws it over to the courier
make it fast i dont want to chance him being seen
frightened what about the arrangements
how can i be sure about the arrangements
youre under our protection the corleone family will never find you
ola leads the courier to the adjoining room where two smartly dressed military cuban police are standing and a civilian
the courier sees them looks back to ola
one of the police steps forward placing the courier under arrest handcuffing him
hey whats this
the other takes the packet of money and hands it to the civilian who places it in the briefcase he carries
the other officer kneels down and fastens leg manacles
the captain strikes him expertly across the side of his head with his pistol
ola closes the door on this scene
fredo corleone steps out of a car squints up at the sunshine and palm trees
he is holding on tightly to a small satchel which he wont let the bellman carry along with his other things
michael and fredo in a brothers embrace they kiss each other
fredo is still in his jacket holding the satchel
how are you
he glances up at bussetta who doesnt say a word
fredo extends his hand
hiya freddie corleone
then bussetta offers his hand back to fredo
taking off his jacket what a trip jesus christ the whole time im thinking what if someone knew what i got in here
he undoes the combination of the briefcase starts taking out cash
then he stops remembering that theres a stranger in the room
oh scuse me
its all right
he stays with me all the time
mikey whats up
im totally in the dark
were making an investment in havana
great havanas great
lots of activity in havana
anybody i know here
i never met them
he was ambushed by the rosato brothers
pause didnt you know that
no i didnt
who tells me anything
i been kept in the dark so long im getting used to it
i want you to help me fredo
thats what im here for
tonight i want to relax with you
the senator from nevada is here with some people from washington
i want to show them a good time in havana
count on me thats my specialty
id like to come along
theres been a lot of strain and ive been cooped up in this room for three days
me and you great
gimme an hour to wash my face and do my research and well have these washington suckers right where you want em
then a thought strikes him poor frankie five angels
he always wanted to die in bed
with a broad
michael stands at roths door carrying the briefcase that fredo had brought
a hotel doctor takes hyman roths blood pressure while his wife waits nervously
spanish you must not exert yourself i will write out a prescription and come back tomorrow
hes going to write a prescription
i want my own doctor fly him in from miami
i dont trust a doctor who cant speak english
the doctor is shown out
roth gestures to the hotel man who also leaves
then he looks to his wife
honey go down to the casino
if you feel better
play the bingo game
they kiss and she leaves
also bussetta and ola remain
my sixth sense tells me you have a bag full of money in your hand
ola locks the door michael nods and opens the bag spilling its contents on the card table
this doubles my investment
still no word of your courier
well find him
but at least this will satisfy our friends here
youve been invited to the new year reception at the presidential home
i understand your brother is here as well i hope hell come
six million dollars in cash is a high price for a piece of a country in the middle of a revolution
roth looks patiently at michael as though he were a child who hadnt minded the lesson that he had been taught over and over again
youre a careful kid and thats good
an international dispatch on the wire service
american journalism not propaganda
the government troops have all but eliminated the rebels
all but their radio station
ive read it im pleased that the government is doing so well
as a heavy investor im pleased
how did the doctor find you
id give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting
who had frankie pantangeli killed
taken a bit off balance why
the rosato brothers
i know that but who gave the go ahead
roth glances to ola he is not a fool he realizes michael has begun to suspect him
i know it wasnt me
so that leaves you
there was this kid that i grew up with he was a couple years younger than me and sort of looked up to me you know
we did our first work together worked our way out of the street
things were good and we made the most of it
during prohibition we ran molasses up to canada and made a fortune your father too
i guess as much as anyone i loved him and trusted him
later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop over for g
s on the way to the west coast
that kids name was moe greene and the city he invented was las vegas
this was a great man a man with vision and guts and there isnt even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town
someone put a bullet through his eye no one knows who gave the order
when i heard about it i wasnt angry
i knew moe i knew he was headstrong and talking loud and saying stupid things
so when he turned up dead i let it go and said to myself this is the business weve chosen
i never asked who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business
he regards michael silently a moment
continuing theres three million dollars on that table
im going to lie down maybe take a nap
when i wake up if its still there ill know i have a partner
if its gone then ill know i dont
the old man turns and moves in his slippers toward his bedroom
michael closes the door and moves down the hallway
he is followed by bussetta who had waited in the corridor
sicilian how sick do you think the old man is
sicilian hell live longer than me
a havana extravaganza with tall beautiful showgirls done up in flamboyant south of the border carmen miranda costumes the lead singer is a six foot blonde doing rum and coca
cola in that style
her name is yolanda
at a large round table located in an obvious vip section of the high tropically draped room with living ferns and other tropical planting with artificial stars
michael rises to be introduced by fredo to some conservative looking senatorial types including senator pat geary of nevada
we notice bussetta standing nearby
does everyone know everyone or nobody knows nobody
here my brother michael corleone
well you know senator geary
geary warmly shakes michaels hand
good to see you mike im glad we can spend this time together
this is senator payton from florida judge demalco from new york
questadt from california hes a lawyer with the price control administration
and fred corngold of u t t
they all make themselves comfortable
a waiter with a tray of drinks appears
cuba libres pina coladas you name it
ill take a yolanda
all those girls look like theyre on stilts
the various tropical drinks are distributed
to a night in havana
they all join in
aside to michael jeeze its great you came along mike
you know weve never spent a night out on the town together
i always thought you looked down on me for liking a good time
i never looked down on you fredo
you dont look down at a brother
by now the group has made its way into the casino
some of them are crowded around the crap table senator geary is with the enormous and beautiful yolanda who barely speaks english
there are other girls with some of the men not with michael who gambles dollars while talking to corngold
our information is that castro is dead
there are maybe a few hundred die hards in the sierra muestra but government troops are going to clean them out any day
johnny ola approaches michael
mike can i talk to you
michael follows ola toward the baccarat table a watchful bussetta moves a distance away with them
listen this senator from florida already has a hundred grand worth of markers on the table
we can see senator ream at the table making thousand dollar bets on the bank
they asked him to sign paper to take down the markers but he got mad told them to wait until he was finished
let him gamble
you know he doesnt have that kind of money
mike said let him gamble
fredo puts his arm around his brother he is high with the first attention mike has ever given him as though finally he is being taken seriously as though his
brother needs him
mike i got something special up my sleeve for these boys
you ever hear of superman
and i dont mean the comic book
waitll you see
our group are in a large havana bar the walls totally covered with hundreds of fifths of different types of rum and other liquor
a couple of the girls from the show are out with the men yolanda herself is giving them a private song and dance
fredo is a little loaded and especially attentive to michael this night
mikey why would they ever hit poor old frankie five angels
i loved that ole sonuvabitch
i remember when he was just a button when we were kids
we used to put bedsheets on our heads you know like we were ghosts
an ole frankie come peek into our room wed jump up and hed always pretend like he was really scared
it was hard to have him killed
what do you mean you i thought
it was hard to have him killed
what do you mean you i thought
it was frankie tried to have me hit
i mean are you sure
you know otherwise freddie
no no i dont know anything
youre all falling asleep
we got to see superman
a growing feeling about his brother
the street is lit with tons of neon signs it is alive with people some roving bands of musicians
everywhere are little boys running around begging for money
and in doorways and windows are silent dark skinned women
pushing away from the palm outstretched little hands of the boys goddamn beggers
goddamn city of beggars and pimps and whores
and we bend over backwards to support them with the goddamn sugar quota
to geary whats eating him
he lost a quarter million dollars at the casino
goddamn city of whores
he gave them a bad check
a large room with a succession of platforms arranged step like around a circular area which becomes a stage
there are a hundred or so people practically all men tourists and business men standing on the different levels forming the audience
in the center of the stage is a thick telephone type pole to which is tied a young cuban girl in a flimsy white sacrificial slip
a small band mostly drummers play some latin music
fredos party standing on the ramp looking down at the spectacle
theyre a little woozy from the drinks and late hour
michael is with them but now we sense he is using this time with all exhausted and drunk to come to some important conclusions
why do we have to stand
but its worth it watch
now two high priestesses scantily clad bring in a tall and muscular cuban done up in chains and loin cloth as though he were a captured slave
this is superman thats him thats superman
some preliminary pornographic proceedings go on as the priestesses lead the slave to the virgin tied to the post
the music is percussive and wild
i dont believe it
its got to be fake
thats why they call him superman
johnny ola told me about this i didnt believe it
close on michael turning away
not because of the spectacle which he finds disgusting but at what his brother is saying
but seeing is believing
ole johnny knows all the places
i tol you
can you believe it
if michael would ever allow himself to cry it would be now
continuing the old man roth would never come but johnny knows these places like the back of his hand
michael is alone in his bedroom it seems as though he hasnt slept very much but sits by his window looking out at the city
he is troubled and tired
his radio is on spanish this is rebel radio rebel troops of column four jose marti took the town of baire yesterday at p
the enemy has retreated
this street in havana is like a caribbean tourist city with no indication of the revolution in progress
michael walks along the street alone past the cubans on their way to work past the american ladies who have gotten up early for their shopping spree
spanish continuing an important military action is developing along a kilometer stretch of the central highway
numerous enemy garrisons are left with two alternatives surrender or annihilation
one full block away bussetta rides in the front seat of the dark mercury driving slowly giving michael his privacy but never letting him out of bussettas sight
shopkeepers happily luring the tourists into their shops in broken english
havana is prosperous
continuing victories in war depend on a minimum on weapons and to a maximum on morale
glances back to the dark car following him
in a moment it pulls up to him and he gets into the back seat
standing by his car looking through the cyclone fencing that borders this military training camp operated by the american army near the city
war is not a simple question of rifles bullets guns and planes
a street singer followed by a guitarist sings jose martis words of guantanamera
it is solemn as though it is a song of protest a song of the revolution
nearby in a restaurant michael has lunch with fredo
how is your wife fredo
eating you know her drives me crazy one minute shes a popsicle the next shes all vinegar
sometimes i think
i think i should a married someone like you did
to have kids to have a family
michael turns distracted for a moment at something the singer has sung
yo soy un hombre sincero
i am a sincere man from the land of the palms
are you sincere with me fredo
what are you talking about of course im sincere with you mike
then im going to confide in you trust you with something
sicilian mike are you crazy im your brother
tonight weve been invited to a reception at the presidential palace to bring in the new year
you and i will go in a special car thats being sent
theyll have cocktails
then dinner and a reception with the president
when its over it will be suggested that you take questadt and his friends from washington to spend the night with some women
ill go home alone in the car and before i reach the hotel ill be assassinated
the same man who tried in nevada
hyman roth not pentangeli
but you told me yourself
it was never pentangeli
ive always known that
it was roth all along
he talks to me as a son as his successor but the old man thinks hell live forever
what do you want me to do
to go tonight with me as though we know nothing
ive already made my move
what is it
can i help
the old man will never bring in the new year
fredo realizes what he means looks immediately to bussetta who had been sitting near the door and the musicians
he is gone
the first time ever away from michael moving toward us quickly
he stops knocks on the door of roths suite
then quickly for a man his size he moves without noise to the adjoining door opens it with a key and disappears inside
a moment elapses on the empty corridor and then a roused johnny ola opens the first door
he steps out into the corridor to see who had knocked
confused he is about to return inside when bussetta easily breaks his neck in two from behind
as bussetta quietly pulls the limp body of johnny ola his head bent at an impossible angle and lays it at the foot of the couch
guards who are regular troops patrol the palace in twos carrying machine weapons
now an elite officer checks the identification of the various cars carrying dignitaries as they are driven up to the palace
the one being inspected at the moment contains fredo and michael
we can see the beautifully dressed people on their way to the reception and sense the cheerful mood of this new years eve
bussetta bends over olas body tying the wrists and knees with electrical extensions
he then easily carries the body to the small balcony which all the rooms have
bussetta swings the body over the side of the balcony railing tying the extension cord to the railing and suspending the body so that it is invisible both from the
inside and out during the night
the president his wife and six oldest children great formally the many beautifully and affluently dressed guests
he speaks to them in spanish as one by one they file to him
michael and fredo are presented in a group with several other americans including several of the american businessmen with interests in cuba
the excitement of the night is beginning to build people are out in the streets poor people but they are enthusiastic and lively
traffic stops as an ambulance speeds its way to a hospital siren going
bussetta delicately picks up a small satin cushion that had fallen from the couch and replaces it as though nothing had happened
slowly he cracks the door open which adjoins roths bedroom
there is a slight commotion whispered voices
roth is crying
a group of men lift hyman roths frail body onto a stretcher
realizes that this is the man he is to kill
he is alive breathing hard with his mouth dry and open
the doctor examines him and then gives instructions to the orderly who carries him out presumably to the ambulance
bussetta closes the door on this view
an orchestra plays for the guests as an army of waiters serve champagne and hors doeuvres
michael relaxes with senator geary major leon and several of the americans
the embargo on arms shipments from the u
to your government was just a necessary public relations move
only last month your air force received a major shipment of rockets
michael glances at his watch fredo concentrates on this
we believe in non intervention
but the agreement stipulates that our forces may be withdrawn
but as youve seen we have not withdrawn them
and my guess is that president eisenhower wont pull out while we have over three billion invested over here
where are you going
i wanted to get a refill
how about you
the ambulance makes its way up to the emergency section of the hospital
the orderlies quickly carry the old man inside
his wife and the doctor and several of his men follow in another car
and we see bussetta waiting in the shadows
the growing crowds of cubans begin their celebration
a cuban military detachment speeds along in the night motorcyclists clear a path through the celebrants
a full sitdown dinner is being served the guests
michael sits at a table at dinner with several of the distinguished cubans and some of the american businessmen
whats kept mr
fredo looks up at michael
in the back of the room we notice the detachment of military moving quickly through the reception room on their way to the presidents private quarters
michael notices it as well
the activity at the end of the hall has come to rest we can tell that the doctor tells mrs
roth that she should go the old man will be taken to a room where he can rest
gradually these people leave him in the care of the hospital staff
bussetta watches from the distance of the hallway after the old man has been moved he quietly walks down the hallway to the room
a nurse sits in the room in attendance hyman roth is asleep his mouth wide open breathing noisily
hears footsteps quickly steps away from the door and into another room
some nurses and attendants speak to the nurse in the room in spanish one has brought a small bottle of wine and obviously they are inviting the nurse to have
a new years toast with them
they laugh and the nurse steps away from the room for a moment
bussetta moves slowly back into the room alone with the helpless roth
seeing in the new year a great banner is hoisted up in spanish welcoming
hands are shaken kisses exchanged
michael and fredo in an embrace they kiss one another
ive arranged for a plane were going to miami in an hour
try not to make a big thing of it
he kisses his brother once again
sicilian i know it was you fredo
youve broken my heart
slowly understanding fredo backs away from his brother taking the kiss another way
a little distance away major leon notices an old woman one of the presidents maids moving across the alcove carrying her suitcases
what a pity shes crying
must have been fired and shes been with the presidents family for twenty years
the gathered crowd joyously welcomes the new year
we notice the continual military movement
a family surreptitiously leaves their home carrying suitcases and belongings
bussetta raises a hospital pillow and easily begins to smother the thin old man who can barely struggle
a detachment of military move quickly accompanied by some of roths men as though they have important news that must be dealt with
they pass the small group of aides and nurses welcoming the new year
seeing them the nurse assigned to him puts down her glass and moves quickly to the room
she opens the door and lays bare the sight of bussetta smothering roth
bussetta turns quickly and one of the military takes out his pistol and shoots several times at his head
the entire reception has been disrupted for an announcement all the guests in their formal dress and evening gowns standing with frightened faces like first class passengers on a doomed
the president himself his back to our view is making an announcement in spanish
while he speaks we notice continuous movement of his personal staff carrying suitcases and possessions
because of serious setbacks of our troops in guantanamo and santiago we feel reluctantly that we must leave the capital at once
myself and my family must bid you goodbye and good fortune
we will go directly to ciudad trujillo
the crowd is stunned already whispers are moving throughout the guests
the only one who is not completely taken off guard is michael who quietly steps back and disappears from the room
my only regret is that there could not have been more warning
as my last official act as president i hereby appoint a provisional government with dr
piedra as its president
by now there is only one thought among the guests how can they get out and with what
we see evidence of the confusion at this late hour already cars are beginning to move people leaving the palace in haste
michael moves quickly toward his car
he sees fredo watching him in fear
come with me
its your only way of getting out
terrified of his brother and what he knows fredo backs away into the growing noise and confusion of the crowd
finally he has to step into the car and it roars off
rebel cars with loudspeakers have already picked up the news that batista has conceded
this throws the crowds already gathered for the new year into cheers of joy
they harass a wealthy family who are trying to get away in their car
the people pull them out of the car opening their suitcases out of which spill piles of cash and jewelry into street
michaels car makes its way as the crowd cheers el animale se fue
crowds of panicked and frightened tourists and batistianos are trying to get to the safety of the embassy with the families and possessions
we see geary and some of the americans we had met working their way through the crowds shouting that they are americans in order to get preference on the line
often that declaration brings boos from the crowds
sometimes the joyous cubans will let a family through but again taking away the suitcases rich leather filled with money and valuables
money seems to be stuffed everywhere
all forms of private transportation are jammed with people trying to get out holding cash in their hands for anyone with a yacht or small boat to get them to
a car pulls up and we see sam roth terri roth and some of their men carry the sickly but still alive hyman roth to a private cruiser which is
protected by men with machine guns
within seconds they are on their way to miami
things are no different at the airport where anything that can fly is being jammed with refugees and their money
a wealthy family is arguing with the pilot of a fast airplane trying to force cash on him and his family into the plane
the pilot steadfastly refuses although checking his watch as though his passengers are late
he speaks only english
no this is a private plane
no this plane is taken
finally michaels mercury pulls up and michael approaches the pilot
he isnt here
weve got to leave theyll take this thing apart
the pilot lets michael in as the cuban screams curses at them and begins searching for another plane for his family
as the propeller turns over
groups of the cheering celebrating cubans sing guantanamera now as a song of triumph
closer to him his personal and business life caught in the middle of history
he stops to pick out some choice oranges and peaches from a fruit stand
then he reaches into his pocket for change
it is my pleasure to make this a gift
you are kind
if ever i can do something for you in return please come to me
despite his new position of respect there is little changed about his home
only that they have lived there a while now and the rooms are fuller with the inevitable possessions a young family acquires
he kisses his wife who seems a big apprehensive
he shows her the fruit and from her reaction knows she has something on her mind
sicilian what is it
they step into the tiny parlor where we see an older woman waiting nervously
the signora is a friend of mine
she has a favor to ask of you
sicilian why do you come to me
sicilian she told me to ask you
he seems surprised looks to his wife
she is having some trouble
her landlord has received complaints because of her dog
he told her to get rid of it but her boy loved it so they tried to hide it
when the landlord found out he was so angry he ordered her to leave
even if she truly will let the dog go
sicilian he said he would have the police put us out
thoughtfully i can give you some money to help you move is that what you want
my friends are all here how can i move to another neighborhood with strangers
i want you to speak to the landlord to let me stay
vito nods to the frightened old woman
its done then
you wont have to move ill speak to him tomorrow morning
carmella breaks into a smile which her husband des not acknowledge
the old woman starts to leave the room but she is not convinced
youre sure hell say yes the landlord
im sure hes a good hearted fellow
once i explain how things are with you im sure hell take pity on your misfortunes
dont let it trouble you any more
as he shows her out guard your health for the sake of your children
signor roberto a pompous rather well dressed patrone angrily walks down the steps of one of his tenement buildings
he carries a check list and makes marks with a pencil concerning the condition of his various buildings a broken window here some missing tile there
he bends over to pick up some garbage left by a thoughtless tenant muttering to himself when he sees the shoes and legs of a young worker
he rises to be face to face with a polite vito corleone
the friend of my wife a poor widow with no man to protect her tells me that for some reason she has been ordered to move from your building
she is in despair
she has no money she has no friends except those that live here
signor roberto brusquely answers and continues on his way
i have already rented the apartment to another family
i told her i would speak to you that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding
she has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble so why shouldnt she stay
as one italian to another i ask you the favor
ive already rented it i cannot disappoint the new tenants
theyre paying a higher rent
how much more a month
we sense he is lying five dollars more
vito reaches into his pocket and takes out a roll of bills
here is the six months increase in advance
you neednt speak to her about it shes a proud woman
see me again in another six months
but of course youll let her keep her dog
and who the hell are you to give me orders
watch your manners or youll be on your sicilian ass in the street there
vito raises his hands in surprise his voice is reasonable
im asking you a favor only that
one never knows when one might need a friend isnt that true
here take this money as a sign of my good will and make your own decision
i wont quarrel with it
he puts the money in robertos hand do me this little favor just take it and think carefully
tomorrow morning if you want to give me the money back by all means do so
if you want the woman out of your house how can i stop you
its your property after all
if you dont want the dog in there i can understand
i dislike dogs myself
he pats roberto on the shoulder do me this service eh
i wont forget it
ask your friends in this neighborhood about me theyll tell you im a man who believes in showing his gratitude
without a word more vito leaves a hypnotized roberto standing in front of the tenement his hand clasping the money
a thin young man almost gawky walks down the street in this italian neighborhood his name is hyman suchowsky
he carries his tools as he comes home from work
he is pursued and tormented by a couple of italian youths about his own age eighteen
kid where do you live
whered you get those nigger lips
he tries not to be intimidated finally one of the boys steps in front of him and stops him
say bread in italian
go on how do you say bread in italian
if youre from the neighborhood you should know how to say bread in italian
an amused peter clemenza steps forward from a local coffee house to preside over the fuss
hes a big man in the neighborhood and loves a fight
this kid lives around here but he cant say bread in italian
thats cause hes jew
look at those pregnant lips
he giggles at his own joke
are you a jewboy
the boy doesnt answer tries to keep going
well if youre not a jew say bread in italian
see he cant
and with that he rounds a blow squarely to the boys face sending him sprawling to the cement his tools flying with a clatter
the other italian immediately joins in with a few kicks to the boys stomach
hyman tries to fight back grabs a hold of his tormentors foot and brings him down on the cement as well
for a moment they are rolling around on the sidewalk two against one hyman taking the worst of it
alright alright cut it out
he killed jesus christ
clemenza pulls him off and kicks him in the ass
i said cut it out
to the beaten kid whats your name
i dont believe it
in our neighborhood with a name like that
what are those tools
you work on cars
maybe i know how you can make a couple of extra bucks working as a mechanic
the boy seems agreeable
but you gotta know how to keep your mouth shut and fer chrissakes get rid of that name
ill call you johnny lips
he giggles at his own humor again come on
he leads the boy down the street whispering to him on the side bread in italian is pane
p a n e pane
a newly acquired warehouse stocked with cases of the new product genco pura olive oil
it is the beginning of a new business in the american tradition
now they have one rattling old truck and a few stock boys
genco has become the accountant business manager based on the experience working with his father
but it is clear that vito is the leader and undisputed president of the new enterprise
genco moves through the darkness of the warehouse to the small divided area that vito uses as his office
sicilian the patrone is here
who owns the rat holes
vito nods that he will see him and soon roberto enters on tiptoe his hat in his hand and in a apologetic voice
excuse me i hope i am not a disturbance don corleone
what a terrible misunderstanding
of course signora colombo can stay in the flat
who were those miserable tenants to complain about noise from a poor animal
when they pay such low rent
then abruptly he puts the roll of money on vitos table and steps back a respectful distance
your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me and i want to show that i too have some christian charity
her rent will remain what it was
what was that
in fact reduced bu five dollars
vito embraces him warmly
i accept your generosity
i wont keep you another minute
he quickly takes his leave bowing several times and then makes it back to the safety of the warehouse he sighs deflates his lungs and mops his brow his bones
have turned too jelly with fear at his narrow escape
he all but runs out of the warehouse
genco laughs as he watches
we wont see him for weeks
hell stay in bed in the bronx
clemenza has been waiting with his new mechanic
we notice the subtle difference in the way he treats vito
he is no longer a junior apprentice in their petty crimes but an imposing leader
this kid is good with cars he kiijed at the truck and says he can keep it going
vito looks over the lanky young man
whats your name
hes gonna dump that i call him johnny lips
who is the greatest man you can think of
go on answer him when he talks to you
tell him columbus marconi
then take that as your name hyman rothstein
genco is out in the alley he calls out with glee
look at this
vito moves out to the smiling genco clemenza and the newly christened hyman rothstein follow a distance behind
genco stands beaming as two workers raise up high the freshly painted sign genco olive oil company
enthusiastically god bless america
were in business
the young men watch as the sign is hoisted into place
our view goes from one to the other clemenza genco vito and hyman rothstein
willy cicci pentangelis associate and bodyguard takes a drink of water
from the year to the present time you were an employee of the genco olive oil company
but in actuality you were a member of the corleone crime organization
the corleone family senator
we called it the family
what position did you occupy
at first like everybody i was a soldier
a thin angular baptist with a mid western accent
what is that exactly
you know senator
no i dont know explain that exactly
when the boss says push the button on a guy i push the button see senator
the senators treat cicci with a surface courtesy as if he were a curious kind of animal not really human
cicci reacts to this by being even more brutally forthright than he has to be to show his contempt for what he considers a hypocrisy
the view alters from senator kane to the committees attorney mr
you mean you killed people at the behest of your superiors
thats right counsellor
and the head of your family was michael corleone
yeah counsellor michael corleone
did you ever get such an order directly from michael corleone
no senator i never talked to him
very autocratic deep south gentlemanly man there was always a buffer someone in between you who gave you orders
yeah a buffer the family had a lot of buffers
a limousine pulls up at a private area near the side of the hotel
michael exits the limousine followed by hagen and neri
do you think they have somebody to back up cicci
but if they do have somebody youll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name
michael smiles to him but its a cold deadly smile
michael take the fifth all the way that way you cant get into trouble
a corleone bodyguard waits outside on the balcony overlooking the pool area
through the translucent draperies we see a grouping of me
michael hagen neri and rocco are seated in this luxury in the hotel
michael sits in a comfortable chair in his apartment
neri comes and brings him a drink without asking but michael refuses it
al get me a wet towel
does kay know im back
did the boy get something from me for christmas
i took care of it
what was it so ill know
a little care he can ride in with an electric motor
neri comes around with a wet face towel which michael uses to cool his eyes
he puts the used towel down on the table
fellas can you wait outside a minute
they know what he means and leave the apartment going out to the balcony where we can see them but they cannot hear
only hagen remains
wheres my brother
roth got out on a private boat
hes in a hospital in miami
had a stroke but hes recovered okay
i asked about fredo
the new government arrested him held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people including roths brother sam
the american embassy arranged flights for citizens im not sure but i think hes somewhere in new york
i want you to reach fredo
i know hes scared but have one of our people reach him
assure him that there will be no reprisals
tell him that i know roth misled him
my information is that fredo thought it was a kidnapping
roth assured him nothing would happen to you
indicating rocco and neri on the balcony they can come in now
theres something else
hagen pauses doesnt know how to begin
impatiently go on tell me
kay had a miscarriage she lost the baby
after a moment was it a boy or a girl
mike at three and a half
what is it cant you give me straight answers anymore
it was a boy
shes all right
she took the senate investigation worse
does she blame it on me
i dont know
the first snow of the new year has fallen the trees are bare and there is hush all over this part of the sierras
michael is driven in his car looking out at the familiar sight of the home he has been forced to be away from
looking out from his window
the last time he had seen the estate it was warm and the trees were full
approaching the great stone gates closed
the bodyguards are not readily visible but they are there
the iron gates are opened and one of the men makes a simple nod of respect as the car pulls in
inside the estate the private roads have been freshly plowed and occasionally a worker will pause to watch the car as it passes
the grandchildren are in school now and so the estate is especially quiet
although there are signs that children live here a bicycle a sled a swing and gymnastic set wet and with a rim of snow still on it
to the outside where michael walks slowly
he stops and looks at a little italian red sportscar made for children
the front door opens and michael enters his own home
it is very quiet no one is at home to greet him
he can see the evidence of his family things his wife and his children have been using and left on a sofa or a table
he moves toward his and kays bedroom where we can hear the sound of a sewing machine running
quietly he opens the door
into the bedroom
kay is sitting by the window lit by the cold afternoon light at work with her sewing machine
she hasnt noticed that hes in the room yet and goes on with her work
stands there a moment watching not making a sound
and then without a word he steps back and closes the door so that she doesnt see him
onto michael moving outside walking through the snow he moves to the house next to his own
this is the house where mama lives with connies children connie so rarely is there
he steps in his mother is asleep in a chair in the living room
he moves to her and bends low whispers
she opens her eyes which are red and small with age
sicilian its michael
how are you mom
sicilian im alright
will you stay home for awhile
sicilian there are still things i have to do
sicilian well we can all have a nice dinner together tonight
how are your eyes
they bother me once in awhile
a pause as he thinks tell me when pop had troubles
did he ever think even to himself that he had gone the wrong way that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family that he could
that he could
lose it instead
sicilian you talk about the baby
she can have another baby
sicilian no i meant lose his family
as best she ever understood it your family
how can you ever lose your family
almost to himself but times are different
quietly we hear the music of a small band playing an italian march
from the orchestration we know it is from the past
vitone and his young family mama santino fredo and the baby michael are met at the small station in sicily by friends and mamas relatives
there is a small band playing for the occasion
a small man has brought a motor car to pick the family up and there are certain dark men with shotguns slung over their shoulders to preside over the occasion
the family is helped into the car the luggage is packed on the roof and the car drives off
the second car with bodyguards following
the villa is bloomed with flowers and don tomasino at this point is a man in his late twenties
he embraces vitone and pats the heads of his children and leads them all into the garden
a sumptuous table is set for the visiting family from america
there is a warm atmosphere as vito his wife and children eat
tomasino and his family received presents from carmella and to tomasinos mother and gifts are given to all of the children
all typically american representing some of the prosperity and interests in the consumer goods that followed a great war
the family exits the church on the plaza of the town
vito shakes hands warmly with the priest
the door is open the footsteps of a man enter the room
we follow these footsteps without quite knowing to whom they belong
they lead us to a bed where we see asleep an old man
he sleeps in his undershirt and is sweating covered by mosquito netting
and we realize that it is young vito looking at the man
we remember that the man is mosca one of three men who almost twenty years before had hunted down vito when he was a boy
with lightning speed vito slashes through the mosquito netting with a knife
and with the movement precise as a butchers he disembowls this man
vito has brought his wife and children to see the olive oil depot which is the link to his new york importing business
they go inside
they are led by one of vitos associates through rows and rows of large vats of olive oil
vito very proudly shows his associates in italy the olive oil can that will be used in the united states
they all stand around at the link to their new importing business and share a toast of wine
a team of sicilian fisherman are at work mending their nets
one sings accompanied by a guitar
he is recognized as the second of the men who had hunted vito down
as he walks we notice there is a figure that is moving through the drying sails and barrels it is vito
he moves quietly stepping up behind the old man
in an instant he has thrown a garrote around his throat twisting it tight so that there is very little sound
then almost silently dragging him through the space hidden by the drying sails
we see an old car approach
its driver is the young tomasino
sitting in the car with him is vito
the car stops at the gates and an old guard sees and recognizes tomasino opens the gates allowing them to enter
on an almost decrepit don francesco
he must be in his early nineties sitting as powerful and as impressive as ever in his throne like chair from which he manages the power as the mafia chieftan
of this village
young don tomasino is speaking
we notice in a little distance in the rear there are some younger shepherds with shotguns thrown over their shoulders
sicilian don francesco if you will honor me by allowing me to introduce my associate in america in new york
his name is vito corleone
the old man and his eyes glance up at a notion of a man who has taken the name of this town as his name
we will supply him with olive oil exclusively in the town of corleone
his company is called the genco olive oil company
here we have brought you an indication of how he will sell the product
tomasino respectfully puts a can of olive oil where the old man can look at it
the old man nods accepting the notion of this business
sicilian we have come to ask your blessing and permission to continue this enterprise
sicilian in a shrill high raspy voice where is this young man
he is right here standing next to me don francesco
sicilian have him come closer i cant see very well
vito takes those several steps so that he is standing right in front of the old man
looking up squinting against the sun
strangely backlit almost blurry image of the young man from america
sicilian what is your name
sicilian vito corleone
sicilian you took the name of this town eh
what was your fathers name
sicilian antonio andolini
the recognition of the name throws a shudder through him
it is as though he recognizes that this is the boy the son of his old enemy whom he had killed and whose sons he had tried to wipe out
the old man raises his feeble hands signalling his guard and in his weak voice he shouts sicilian kill him
but he is too late vito steps forward
sicilian in the name of my father and my brother
and uses the knife ritualistically plunging it into the old mans belly and then up to his throat which is severed
has drawn his pistol and quickly shoots one of the guards helping vito to escape back into the motor car
raising his shotgun
just as tomasino is about to get into the car the shotgun is fired and he is hit in the legs
vito manages to pull him up into the car and they make their escape
some of the townspeople have come bringing flowers and gifts for vito and his family
his wife is radiant with the flowers given her
the train has arrived and the crowd shout ciao come back soon
revealing his good friend tomasino waving from his wheelchair
and his wife
she holds up the baby michael and helps him wave his hand
are you the son of vito corleone
did he use at times an alias
was this alias in certain circles it was not an alias
godfather was a term of affection used by his friends one of respect
senator from new york very smooth partly liberal tammany hall let me agree with that
many of my constituents are italian and have been honored with that certain friendship by my close italian friends
up to this point before i have to leave this hearing to join my own committee let me say that this hearing on the mafia is in no way a
slur on the italians by the senate nor is it meant to be nor will i allow it to be
italian americans are the hardest working most law abiding patriotic americans of our country
it is a shame and a pity that a few rotten apples give them a bad name
we are here to weed those rotten apples out of the vast healthy barrel of italian americans who are one of the backbones of our country
there is a pause for a while while the new york senator poses for the tv cameras and leaves the hearing so that he will not be associated with hearing
the rough stuff
im sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague
corleone you have been advised as to your legal rights
we have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful mafia family in this country
this witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a new york police captain in the year and with him a man named virgil sollozzo
do you deny this
i deny his every charge
is it true that in the year you devised the murder of the heads of the five families in new york to assume and consolidate your nefarious power
that is a complete falsehood
is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in las vegas
that is not true
i own some stock in some of the hotels but only very small amounts
i also own some american telephone and ibm stock
michael had checked this point with hagen before answering and then once again after the answer
why is it necessary for your counsel to advise you on that question
senator ive observed the head of general motors before a senate committee and his lawyer whispered in his ear
that was not commented upon in the way you have just done
corleone do you have any hotel interests in the state of arizona
or any gambling interests in that state
i do not
do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of new york
i do not
silence as the chairman whispers something to his assistant
tom hagen takes a paper out of his briefcase and addresses the chair
senator my client would like to read a statement for the record
i dont think thats necessary
sir my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity
he has not taken that fifth amendment as it was his right to do and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing counsel advised him to do
so i think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record
at this point senator rogers contemptuously walks out of the hearing room
reading in the hopes of clearing my family name in the sincere desire to give my children their fair share of the american way of life without a blemish on
their name and background i have appeared before this committee and given it all the cooperation in my power
i consider my being called before this committee an act of prejudice to all americans of italian extraction
i consider it a great dishonor to me personally to have to deny that i am a criminal
i wish to have the following noted for the record
that i served my country faithfully and honorably in world war ii and was awarded the distinguished service cross for actions in defense of my country
that i have never been arrested or indicted for any crime whatsoever
that no proof linking me to any criminal conspiracy whether it is called mafia or cosa nostra or whatever other name you wish to give has ever been made public
only one man has made charges against me and that man is known to be a murderer arsonist and rapist
and yet this committee had used this person to besmirch my name
my personal protest can only be made to the people of this country
i can only thank god that in this country we have a legal system and courts of law to protect innocent people from wild accusation
i thank god for our democratic due process of law that shields me from the false charges made by this committees witness
i have not taken refuge behind the fifth amendment though counsel advised me to do so
i challenge this committee to produce any witness or evidence against me and if they do not i hope they will have the decency to clear my name with the
same publicity with which they have now besmirched it
i ask this without malice in the interests of fair play
the television cameras have documented this moment as hagen hands the document over to the committee lawyer
we are all impressed
the committee will now recess over the weekend
however it will continue monday morning at eleven a
at that time this committee will then produce a witness directly linking mr
corleone to the charges we have made
and then mr
corleone may very well by liable for indictments of perjury
however this document will be made a matter of record
an army post somewhere in the east
it is safely guarded
where pentangeli is being held by his constant companions the two fbi men
ten to one shot you said
ten to one shot in my favor and i lose
get a good nights sleep
we got a new suit new shirt new tie and im going to shave you myself
tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow americans
my life wont be worth a nickel after tomorrow
we have a special home for you for the rest of your life
nobody gets near you
youre not going any place
yeah some deal i made
you live like a king
youll be a hero
youll live better in here than most people on the outside
pause i just wish mike had took the fifth
whyd you do it frankie
after all these years whyd you turn against him
i didnt turn against nobody he turned against me
a somewhat frightened fredo corleone sits in the easy chair overlooking the lake in this canopied section of the boathouse
rocco sits with him
michael is in the dark room with hagen and neri
how did they get their hands on pentangeli
roth engineered it michael
he made pentangeli think you hit him
deliberately letting him get off alive
then the new york detectives turned frankie over to the fbi
my informants say he was half dead and scared stiff talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him
anyway they had him on possession dealing in heroin murder one and a lot more
theres no way we can get to him and youve opened yourself to five points of perjury
theyve got him airtight
hes in a military base twenty four hour guards
trying to kill him is like trying to like the president its impossible
what does fredo know
he says he doesnt know anything and i believe him
roth played this one beautifully
im going to go outside and talk to fredo
fredo sits on the couch
when rocco sees michael he automatically takes his leave
michael sits in the chair opposite fredo
after a pause i dont have a lot to say michael
we have time
i was kept pretty much in the dark
i didnt know all that much
what about now is there anything you can help me out with
i know they get pentangeli thats all i know
fredo gets up walks to the glass panel that separates the terrace from the lake
i didnt know it was a hit
i swear to you i didnt know
johnny ola contacted me in beverly hills said he wanted to talk
he said you and roth were in on some big deal and there was a place for me in it if i could help them out
they said you were being tough on the negotiation and if they had a little bit of help they could close it fast and it would be good for you
and you believed that story
he said there was something good in it for me
me on my own
ive always taken care of you
taken care of me
mike youre my kid brother and you take care of my
did you ever think of that
send fredo off to do this send fredo to take care of that
take care of some little unimportant night club here and there pick somebody up at the airport
mike im your older brother i was stepped over
its the way pop wanted it
it wasnt the way i wanted it
i can handle things
im not dumb christ not like everyone says
im smart and i want respect
theres nothing more you can tell me about this investigation
the lawyer questadt he belongs to roth
youre nothing to me now fredo not a brother not a friend i dont want to know you or what happens to you
i dont want to see you at the hotels or near my home
when you visit our mother i want to know a day in advance so i wont be there
do you understand
michael turns and starts to leave
a frightened voice behind him mikey
michael doesnt stop doesnt turn back
he continues off through the veranda and out the summer doors
neri stops by him
i dont want anything to happen to him while my mothers alive
five cars brimming with army guards and agents are waiting to move pentangeli
there is one empty car
the two fbi agents are helping pentangeli get dressed
hes in brightly colored striped shorts and bare chested
the agents help him with the shirt and tie
one holds out the trousers but pentangeli ignores it and looks at himself in the mirror
the agents open the door and precede him surveying the area
they check the cars waiting each with two agents
they check the gate and note the military sentries
then they stand aside and let pentangeli come out
they get close to his side and it is obvious they will protect his life with their own
the agents put him in the front seat of the empty car and get in with him one at each side
another agent drives
now the first cars start out the sentries opening the gates and letting the caravan pass
an army supply truck comes very close to them and the agents next to pentangeli become very tense
then the truck passes on and they relax
the room is crowded with tv journalists cameras etc
we pick pentangeli up closely guarded being led to witness chair
pentangeli is seated and made to take his oath
fbi agents are all around him
anyone given entrance to the caucus room is being frisked
the five senators take their places
waiting at his long table very nervous
he seems startled by the appearance of pentangeli
catching hagens eye
its as though he is pleading for some kind of understanding of the fact that he has become a traitor
cold then he turns away
the bustle is settling down then michael corleone enters and with him is someone very peculiar and out of keeping for this setting
a burly chested imposing man of middle age
very powerful looking with frightening magnetic eyes
his dress is odd boots rough tie and shirt
he could be the tenor out of a sicilian opera
he is clearly a country don direct from sicily and he dominates the room
at first his view is blocked
then he sees michael and is a bit shamefaced but still defiant
michael returns his glances without emotion
then the view alters revealing the sicilian
he is terror stricken obviously he recognizes the man
michael and the sicilian sit by hagen where they can stare directly at pentangeli he is frozen with fear
notices the tension in the room
the chairman commences we have here a witness who will testify further on michael corleones rule of the criminal empire that controls gambling in this country and perhaps in other
this witness had no buffer between himself and michael corleone
he can corroborate our charges on enough counts for this committee to consider a charge of perjury against michael corleone
then he turns to pentangeli your name please for the record
were you a member of the corleone family
were you under the caporegime peter clemenza under vito corleone known as the godfather
there is a long silence
he seems unable to speak
gazing at him
i never knew no godfather
i got my own family
senator kane is stunned
the two fbi men are alert their eyes searching the room for what has intimidated their witness at the last moment
pentangeli you are contradicting your confessions to our investigators i ask you again were you a member of a crime organization headed by michael corleone
i never heard of it
i never heard of nothing like that
i was in the olive oil business with his father a long time ago
we have your confession that you murdered on the orders of michael corleone
do you deny that confession and do you know what denying that confession will mean to you
the die is cast and like a good soldier pentangeli will go all the way now
so he is brazen in his defiance of the senator
the fbi guys promised me a deal
so i made up a lot of stuff about michael corleone
because then thats what they wanted
but it was all lies
they said michael corleone did this michael corleone did that
so i said yeah sure
he makes a big grin to show how he has made fools of everybody
glancing around the room their eyes have settled on the sicilian
one of them scribbles a note on a piece of paper and passes it to the committee lawyer
then in turn it goes to senator kane
hagen would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand
coolly yes sir
his name is vincenzo pentangeli
is he related to the witness
he is i believe a brother
they wait with no expression
to vincenzo pentangeli sir i would like you to take the stand
vincenzo stares at him uncomprehending
there may just be a shadow of contempt
he doesnt answer
sir the gentleman does not understand english
he would not in any case take the stand
he came at his own expense to aid his brother in his trouble
he is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable
furious the witness is excused take him out
the guards and fbi agents quickly remove pentangeli as everybody else in the room is required to sit still
this meeting is adjourned
rising and shouting this committee owes an apology
the committee is adjourned until further notice
for the first time in the midst of the confusion hagen smiles
a bitter contemptuous smile
the modest champion
he rises and they take their leave
they watch the corleone party as they exit
the corleone nurse is waiting playing with the little girl mary
a distance away the boy anthony is standing by himself
the door to michaels suite opens rocco leans in
michael is sitting in an easy chair he seems to have difficulty with his eyes
on the phone
no shes here
michael rises surprised
rocco steps back and kay enters
i had no idea
i wanted to see you before you went back to nevada
also the children michael theyre here
in a minute
theyre outside with esther
im very happy for you
i suppose i knew that youre simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you
why dont you sit down
im not going to stay long i cant
there are a lot of things i want to talk to you about
things ive been thinking about changes i want to make
i think its too late for changes michael
i promised myself i wouldnt talk about it and ive gone and spoiled it
why too late
tell me michael
what really happened with pentangeli
his brother came to help him
i didnt even know he had a brother
and where is he now
on a plane back to sicily
and thats all he had to do
just show his face
you see in sicily in the old days
there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative
if he was a traitor
you would have killed his brother
kay youve got it wrong
that kind of things all over i promised you
this was between the two brothers
years ago frankie had a young girlfriend he called her his co wife
that was his joke but he meant it
he wouldnt divorce his wife
because she was a great cook
he said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her
he set her up in a house in jersey
she had to be faithful
and she had to have kids
and she did two a boy and a girl
he had her checked out and watched so she couldnt cheat
but the girl couldnt stand that kind of life
she begged him to let her go
he gave her money and made her give up the kids
then frankie took them to italy and had them brought up by his brother vincenzo
where he knew theyd by safe
kay begins to realize
when he saw his brother in the hearing room he knew what was at stake
pause i dont think vincenzo would have done it
he loves the kids too
it had nothing to do with me
it was between those brothers
ill bring the children up now they want to say goodbye
kay i told you
i wont let you leave
christ do you think im going to let you leave
no i dont want to hear anything
there are things between men and women that will not change things that have been the same for thousands of years
you are my wife and they are my children
and i love you and i will not let you leave because you are mine
oh i do feel things for you michael but now i think its pity
for the first time since ive known you you seem so helpless
you held me a prisoner once will you try again
if thats what it takes then yes i will
at this moment i feel no love for you at all
i never thought that could happen but it has
well go back tonight
bring the children
you havent heard me
he moves to her he does love her and is tender with her
how can i let you leave how can i let you take my children away
dont you know me
you understand its an impossibility
i would never let it happen no never not if it took all my strength all my cunning
but in time soon youll feel differently
you see youll be happy that i stopped you
i know you
youll forget about this youll forget about the baby we lost
and well go on you and the baby i lost
i know what it meant
and im prepared to make it up to you
i will make changes i can
he clenches his fist tightly i can change that i have learned that i have the strength to change
and we have another child a boy
and youll forget the miscarriage
it wasnt a miscarriage
and you with your cunning couldnt you figure it out
it was an abortion an abortion like our marriage is an abortion something unholy and evil
i dont want your son i wouldnt bring another of your sons into this world
an abortion michael
it was a son and i had it killed but this must all end
he had no hint not in his wildest imagination could he have guessed that she would do such a thing
and i know that now its over i knew it then there would be no way you could ever forgive me not with this sicilian thing that goes back two
he is silent though raging then with all his passion and his strength he raises his arms and strikes her across her neck literally knocking her down to the floor
and hurting her badly
coldly you wont take my children
a collection of dark cars and black limousines are gathered to one side
a few drivers wait quietly
and then to the other extreme of the estate is a small grouping of about twenty to thirty people gathered near michaels house
connie corleone dressed simply and now showing her age without the carefully applied makeup which we have been used to kneels down before the shrine of santa theresa and puts
down a bouquet of flowers along with others that have been placed there
we see that some have the simple silk ribbon with the word mama hand lettered upon it
her two children stand close behind her they had been raised by their grandmother
connie steps back and moves through the small group of friends and relatives into michaels house
fredo kneeling by the coffin of his mother in a portion of the house that has been set aside for the wake
fredo concludes his prayer wipes away the tears in his eyes and steps away from the coffin
he stops when he notices neri a little distance away looking at him
after a moment he nods respectfully to fredo and steps forward moving to the old womans coffin
fredo moves to hagen who is there with his wife and children
difficult to tell him hes waiting for you to leave
can i talk to him
im sorry freddie
who has heard this can i see him
hes in the boathouse
michael sits quietly in the darkened room in one of the big sofas dressed immaculately in suit and tie
his two children also dressed for the wake sit opposite him in the other oversized sofa their shoes not touching the floor
we regard this tableau for a long moment
she comes in and sits down by his knees
i want to stay close to home now is that alright
is kay coming
michael fredos in the house with mama
he asked for you and tom said he couldnt see you
tom is right
kids why dont you go outside for a while
the children dont move connie realizes they will only listen to michael
i want to talk to you michael
the children can stay
i hated you for so long michael for so many years
i think i did things to myself to hurt myself so that you would know and you would be hurt too
but i understand you now i think i do
you were being strong for all of us like papa was
and i forgive you and want to be close to you now
cant you forgive fredo hes so sweet and helpless without you
slowly michael puts his hand on her hair and touches her gently
you need me michael
i want to be with you now
friends relatives francesca and her new husband gardner and their baby sandra corleone teresa her children all the familiar faces of the family are present quietly paying their respects to
some of the men can be seen in the kitchen drinking wine and talking in low voices
fredo is there broken hearted over the loss of his mother like some lost child with no friends
michael enters the room followed by connie who tends little mary and anthony
he approaches his brother and then embraces
fredo breaks into tears
jesus christ mike
embracing his brother he glances up
quiet and deadly
tom hagen is talking in the distance to his wife and one of his older sons he kisses and moves toward the boathouse
after crossing the lawn he stops
waiting there obviously wanting to talk to him
he continues and she walks with him
as they cross toward the boathouse
youre going to talk to him now
will you tell him
i dont know
she stops him
tom think of yourself for once
dont let this opportunity slip through your fingers dont do it
were all trapped here dont you see
he continues past her without answering her
continues up to the boathouse
he stops before he enters
fredo is sitting by the edge of the harbor with michaels son anthony he is helping him with some fishing rig
looking through the window at his son and brother
neri sits in the room dressed informally
without looking back sit down tom
have you heard about our friend and partner mr
i know hes in israel
hands hagen the paper the high court of israel turned down his request to live as a returned jew
his passports been invalidated except for return to the u
he landed in buenos aires yesterday offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship
they turned him down
reading hes going to try panama
they wont take him not for a million not for ten million
his medical condition is reported as
hes been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years
that plane goes to miami
i want it met
understanding mike its impossible
hell be met by the internal revenue the customs service and half the fbi
i dont like it when you use the word impossible nothing is impossible
mike it would be like trying to kill the president theres no way we can get to him
im surprised at you tom
if theres anything certain certain in life if history has taught us anything its that you can kill
he stops then coldly anybody
but perhaps your relucatance is because youve come to tell me that youre moving your family to vegas that youve been offered the vice presidency of the houstan hotels there
or werent you going to tell me at all
are you so hungry for traitors do you want to find them everywhere
they are everywhere
i turned houstan down i didnt see why i should tell you about an offer i turned down
michael begins to confuse him are you sure mikey
are you sure of what were doing what well gain what does the family gain
forget that mike i already know the answer
i know you do tom
then i can count on you to help me do the things i have to do
if not call houstan and become a vice president
take your family and your mistress and move them to las vegas
why do you hurt me michael
ive always been loyal to you
then youre staying
then without being asked dont ever enjoy the cruel part of all this sonny never listened to me about that
then he sits down and opens his briefcase now explain everything to me
fredo sits with anthony with a silly looking fishing hat on his head covered with lure and flies
anthony ole buddy your uncle fredos gonna teach you how to catch the big fish
you know when i was a kid i did this amazing thing
i went out on a fishing trip me and my brothers and my pop and no one could catch a fish except me
and this was my secret confidentially every time i would put the line down i would say a hail mary and every time i said a hail mary i would
catch a fish
now when its sunset were gonna go out on the lake and were gonna try it
the guards step aside as tom hagen enters the foyer of the house
he shows a court order to them and they lead him up the stairs where he knocks on the door
there is a knock at the door
the two guards show hagen in and hagen presents the court order to one of the fbi men
i think i prefer to see my client privately
the room has a bug in it
to the fbi men id like to go outside with him in the open air
this room is not bugged
you have guards outside and the electric fence
theres no security reason for not letting us talk in the yard
they pass out of the room
hagen and pentangeli outside by the electric fence
they cannot be overheard
pentangeli takes out some cigars and offers hagen one
hagen takes it and pentangeli lights both their cigars
they puff on them contentedly
they are comfortable together almost
everything is going to be okay frankie dont worry
did my brother go back
yeah but dont worry
hes ten times tougher than me my brother
hes old fashioned
he wouldnt even go out to dinner
just wanted to go home
thats my brother
nothing could get him away from that two mule town
he coulda been big over here he could of had his own family
tom what do i do now
the light is beginning to turn reddish as the sun falls
frankie you were always interested in politics in history
i remember you talking about hitler back in
we were young then
yeah i still read a lot
they bring me stuff
you were around the old timers who dreamed up how the families should be organized how they based it on the old roman legions and called them regimes
with the capos and soldiers and it worked
yeah it worked
those were great old days
we was like the roman empire
the corleone family was like the roman empire
sadly yeah it was once
they both puff on their cigars
pentangeli lets himself be carried away by thoughts of old days of glory hagen thinks of other days too
very gently the roman empire
when a plot against the emperor failed the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes
yeah but only the rich guys
the little guys got knocked off
if they got arrested and executed all their estate went to the emperor
if they just went home and killed themselves up front nothing happened
yeah that was a good break
a nice deal
pentangeli looks at hagen he understands
they went home and sat in a hot bath and opened their veins and bled to death
sometimes they gave a little party before they did it
hagen throws away his cigar
pentangeli puffs on his
dont worry about anything frankie five angels
they shake hands
the fbi agents come out to let hagen out the gate
pentangeli is led back to the house
your lawyer tell you he can get that years reduced to
pentangeli puffs on his cigar and reflects
you boys sure you cant get me a broad for tonight
give me a little party
we got some nice books
pentangeli puffs on his cigar and gives the agent a smile an old man gives a child
he starts upstairs
i guess ill just take a hot bath
hagen walks away glances back
then gets into his waiting car and drives off
michael sits alone in the empty boathouse in the shadows
neri stands by the dock area under the boathouse
he pushes the button which lowers a boat by winch and tackle
he wears a fishing cap
he steps into the boat and pulls the small outboard which glides the boat out into the harbor
the boat pulls up alongside fredo and anthony
here we go and remember the secret
he lifts anthony into the boat
connie in houseclothes is calling anthony
hes here were goin fishing
he cant go michael wants to take him into reno
okay kid you got to go to reno with your pop
he lifts the boy out of the boat and puts him on the shore
ill catch one for you with the secret
neri stands the motor and the boat with the two fisherman glides off
watching from the dark window of the boathouse
the fbi man knocks on the bathroom door in the house where they have kept pentangeli
frankie open up
no answer he hammers on the door
using his elbow and then a kick he breaks into the bathroom
pentangeli lying in a tub of water
his stomach shows above it
his wrists are cut and covered with blood
the bath water has a purplish tone
fredo and neri are fishing each with lines out
the view moves closer and we can hear fredo as he holds the pole
the lord is with thee
blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb jesus
the boat on the shimmery lake
holy mary mother of god pray for us
we hear a quiet echoing gunshot and then silence
an exhausted hyman roth ill shaven and in shirt sleeves in taken into custody by a swarm of customs and fbi men
they allow him to be photographed by press people and television cameramen
roth we have to take you into custody
yes i know
some flashbulbs go off
can you give us your reaction to the high court of israels ruling
i am a retired investor on a pension and i wished to live there as a jew in the twilight of my life
roth is not a well man hes tired of running
im an old man at my age its too late to start worrying
is it true you are worth over three hundred million dollars mr
im a retired investor living on a pension
i came home to vote in the presidential election because they wouldnt give me an absentee ballot
the newsmen and photographers all laugh as the fbi men move him away
one of the newspapermen laughing we recognize to be rocco lampone
he moves closer to roth and shoves his revolver right against his head and in a second on camera assassinates roth
people scream as rocco attempts to run down the airport corridor limping as he does
fbi men easily pick him off
a taxi cab waits by the house its driver sleeping with a newspaper over his face
the cleaning woman esther who had been with kay for years sits by the dining room table weeping profusely
behind her in the recreation room we can see the tableau of kay sitting on the couch her little daughter mary between her knees talking quietly about things we cannot
her son anthony sits by himself in another chair by the side of the room
connie comes into the house quickly and moves toward them
kay you have to go
this prompts esther to weep all the more
kay hugs her daughter and kisses her many times
you have to hurry hes coming
kay puts her coat on then stands and reaches out for her son
anthony kiss mama goodbye
he doesnt move
angrily anthony you kiss your mother goodbye
he rises and walks to her
hugs her lifelessly
on kay kissing her boy
anthony say goodbye your mama loves you
she restrains any tears she has become too strong for tears
kay starts to go picks up mary kisses her and starts to go
she steps out the kitchen door then she cannot help herself
crouches down outside and calls to her son
anthony kiss me once
then she looks up and slowly rises
michael has stepped into the dining room
he seems older somehow as though some sickness has taken more years away from him
looks at him instinctively she takes a step back
slowly steps toward her
another step back the door is still open
he moves closer to the door stops looks at her
and then closes it obscuring any view of her
it is late fall most of the leaves have fallen on the grounds and there is quite a wind
the water is whipped up by the wind and the waves are high as they break against the pavilion
we hear the music of time passing of michael of the godfather over these images
they have not been used in several months they are drained and the bottoms are mossy and dark
leaves blowing past it we dont see the button men only a hint of someone in the gatehouse
some of the houses have had the summer awnings taken down and put away
some of the windows have been boarded up
there are still the guard dogs some sleeping some moving impatiently
as the music concludes its statement
the peninsula of the private corleone harbor
we see the figures of two people seated at a table
michael sits at a table having a sparse lunch
he is attended by his sister connie who seems to be the closest person now living on the estate with him
we see from the way she pampers him with his lunch that she has fallen into the role of a surrogate mother wife
he seems older than his years as though his illness diabetes has taken its toll
dont worry im sure he got here on time
the roads from the airport are so windy it takes forever ive driven them myself
she picks up some of the serving plates that he has left untouched
ill bring him out to you as soon as he comes
she moves back to the main house
he turns and looks at the rough water of the lake for a moment
he slowly takes a sip of wine
there are a few chairs
he is eighteen years old
squinting up at his son
he rises and reaches up to his son who is now taller than he he embraces him
youve grown so tall
so tall in the last year
youre much taller than me
i was taller than you when i was fourteen
your aunt connie and i waited for you to have some lunch but now its all dried out
im not hungry
well thats alright
youll graduate in another year isnt that right
i never finished college
i was a good student but i never finished
of course there was a war then
connie approaches them
dont let me interrupt anything this will just take a second
she takes out a small needle and begins to prepare it your father has to have his insulin shot
why dont you go to your room and put your things away anthony
she begins to give michael the shot
hurry back well talk
anthony goes on his way to the house with his things
connie gives michael the shot
whenever i see that lake so cold i think of poor fredo drowned
lake tahoe is very cold
they say if a person drowns in it that the body will remain mid suspended perfectly preserved
some say it will remain forever
she finishes the shot puts her things away
your boy will be right back
alone in the garden
our view begins to move closer to him
we begin to hear music of the forties happy music swing music as we move closer to michael
sonny corleone his arm wrapped around a smiling red faced carlo rizzi pulls him into the corleone dining room
hey who knows my buddy carlo rizzi
my brother fredo heres my mom
mom whatcha got cooking
and carlo this is my kid sister connie
here pull up a chair carol is sitting next to connie
oh the droopy kid over there is mike
the college boy
an older lanky man enters the room his arms laden with presents
this is tessio
buon natale everybody
he smiles at tom hagen hi tom hows every little thing
helping him with the presents wonderful sal
now the study door opens and don corleone enters
is dinner ready
the don happily regards his family his sons and daughters and even some grandchildren
he raises a glass
a good life a long life to all my children and friends
to my grandchildren and those that will be
to our family
they all drink
they refill glasses then tessio proposes a toast
to our godfather
they all drink
the family is happily at christmas dinner
don corleone seated at the head of the table
whatd you think of those japs eh
the nerve of those japs coming right here in our own backyard dropping bombs
well we could have expected it after the embargo
expect it or not those japs dont have a right to drop bombs in our backyard
whose side you on
please do we have to talk about the war at the table
on christmas much less
he has been listening to this discussion
pop ive decided im going to enlist
a quiet hush descends over the table as though everyone knows the effect this will have on the old man
sonny tries to make light of it
kid stay in college
the girls are cuter if you know what i mean
pop had to pull a lot of strings to get you your deferment
i never asked for it i dont want it
disturbed but wise and prudent
my son wants to talk about this and so well talk but not at the dinner table
he rises and starts across the room toward his study
then he looks back
he disappears into his study
michael rises glances around
people are generally tense over the situation
michael follows his father into the study
the don closes the door behind his son and then moves across the room
he stops at the little bar there and pours himself a brandy
would you like some
now what is this talk about joining the army
its not talk im doing it
you would risk your life for strangers
not for strangers for my country
anyone not in your family is a stranger
believe me when trouble comes your country wont take care of you
thats how it was in the old world pop but this is not sicily
i know michael
its christmas your brothers and sister are all here we are happy
lets not spoil this
go your own way but when you are ready come to me the way a son should
i have hopes for you
looking at his father with a mixture of great love and also fear and confusion
i wont be a man like you
the leaves are blowing
music comes up
michael and his young son anthony walk through the grounds of the estate talking about things we cannot hear
