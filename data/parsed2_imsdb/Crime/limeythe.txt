the limey production draft by lem dobbs by draft wilsons first impression of los angeles was blue
he was in the sky at the time so it was a curious reversal looking down rather than up at the color he had always felt was natures finest
hundreds of them
pockmarking the landscape like miniature lakes
a flat landscape of straight streets and square blocks and sparse grass that didnt look quite green enough
as far as wilson could remember he had only ever seen seven or eight swimming pools in his entire life and they had been public ones
here everyone had their own
there was the one at the butlins holiday camp where he had enjoyed his last legitimate employment as driver of a tour bus
and there was the one at crystal palace he had gone to once or twice when he was younger
he was most familiar though with the chelsea baths as he had lived for some time in a flat nearby in what he now thought of as his good years
before hed gone grey went to prison and found himself in a plane over a foreign town arriving to avenge the death of his daughter
the sound of automatic doors opening and wilson steps out into the late sunlight and the heat of the day
a slow motion moment while he gets acclimatized
he wouldnt have ever felt quite this kind of heat before
after such a rigorously air conditioned interior
or seen cops wearing guns on their belts
or black cops for that matter with guns on their belts
or seen people as fat as americans on their home turf
things someone from england notices immediately whether consciously at first or not
wilsons not here for comfort
shown to a shitty room round the corner of a typical nd level outside walkway
airport close by
he draws a curtain open across a window in one strong easy glide
his moves are neat
his expressions just as economical not giving much away
outside the planes are practically on top of us
the sunset colors strange and chemical
hes only got one light bag
unzips unpacks a few things
change of clothes a travel kit and some familiar items shaving foam toothpaste deodorant bearing unfamiliar british brand names
goes into the bathroom
turns on the shower in there
comes back to sit on the bed
takes an envelope out of his jacket
turns it over to see the return address on the back
wilson in the back
stares at the impenetrable name on the drivers posted id
glances at the driver
driver glances back at his quiet passenger in the rearview mirror
wilson walks up a cracked little path to the front door
lower middle class street
two cars in the driveway one behind the other
lights on inside the house as he rings the bell
chairman mao on his t shirt notwithstanding an easygoing sort of fellow
not looking for any trouble anymore
but once did and able to handle himself if any shows up
which it has
rolling the r rama
youre home then
he turns waves away the taxi hes kept waiting
while eduardo rama waits for an introduction
my names wilson
accent speaks for itself
hard working class
knows the name
but just now its unexpected
hes holding a hot tv dinner hand protected by a dish towel
you wrote to me about my daughter
ed takes wilson inside
i didnt expect anyone
i mean what has it been six months
round about yeah
theyve entered a cauldron of family life
tv blaring showbiz tonight
a couple of younger kids yelling mama
their mother shouting back at them from the kitchen in spanish that she only has two hands
a sullen teenager walking by
i didnt even know who i was writing to just someone with the same last name
she never talked about any family
it was better than a telegram
ed opens a screen door to the backyard
they sit at an outdoor table
wilson with a tv dinner in front of him now too
sounds from inside muted
even this little house has a little pool
who done it then
ed surprised at wilsons directness
ed stands nervously
now wait up a second man
and paces back and forth
i never said nothin about nothin like that
no no no
thats not what i wrote to you
no but between the lines eh
mysterious circumstances and that
ed stops pacing
look i sent you that newspaper clipping all right
i told you what i know
it was an accident
i didnt say anything about anybody being snuffed
this bloke she was bunked up with
this terry whatsit
whats he got to say for himself
whats he gonna say
they had a fight that night she drove away she was upset
i dont even know the guy
dont get me wrong jenny and me were friends but we didnt travel in the same social circles
she had her life i had mine
makes a kind of scoffing gesture and you can see what my life is
valentine came into the restaurant where i work with jenny a couple times
hes a money guy
jenny would say hey heres my friend eddie and he would shake my hand and everything but he wouldnt even see me you know what i mean
wilson gazes up at the sky
how long had she been in the states
as if to himself somewhat wistful near on ten years wasnt it
long enough to know her way about i reckon
ed leans down palms on the tabletop facing wilson
there was an investigation okay
the car was totalled
her neck was broken
on impact they said
so she wouldnt have
felt the effects of the fire
helpless shrug it happens up there
happens a lot
what more can i tell you
wilson taps out a cigarette from a pack of silk cut hes produced from his pocket
what more is there
im just sayin it was a steep hillside
there was no moon that night
wilsons quiet stillness is getting to him
coulda happened to anyone man
i never knew her to be reckless
i mean sure she would smoke a little grass or something have a few drinks
but thats it nothing more than that
no not my girl
self control she had
point of pride
smokes and people dont change do they
maybe they do
wilson notes the tattoos on eds forearms
going straight are ya
ed looks at him
sits down again
keeping his forearms under the table
looks away boomerang
i knew when i was droppin that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face
looks at wilson again i did my time okay
my sister her ol mans up in chino right now doin eight years
re the family inside this aint your lot
you kiddin man
i dont need a wife and screamin kids
i still got my youth
and yet he lives here
wilson declines to pursue the matter
i go to work try to keep my life together put all that shit behind me man
what dyou want from me
calmly smoking i only asked
reaches for one of wilsons cigarettes
couple weeks before she died jennifer asked me to drive her downtown
said she was meeting her boyfriend valentine
but i think she was looking for him
ed and jennifer
in a car downtown
she has the same steely intensity as her father
ed looks a little worried
lighting eds cigarette what tryin to catch him with another bird
thats what i thought man
but it was not a hotel or nothin that we went to
it was someplace else
talking to a beefy supervisor
or talking at him
either way he isnt happy
watch instead of working
taking all this in
bad place man
some guys loading some trucks
some kinda deal goin down
anticipating wilsons next question i dont know and i dont care
maybe theyre shipping fava beans to eskimos
did jenny know
shrugs valentine wasnt even there
if he was into something if she was involved who can say
stands up again but ill tell you something
she stood in front of these dudes man
eyeballing them checking them out
beat i felt like she was covering my ass that day
unconsciously rubbing his arms where his tattoos are
i drove her back to valentines house
standing in front of his house
his expression says we have something to discuss
he was standing outside waiting for her
thats the only other time i ever saw him
a short sad note last time i saw her
he meets wilsons gaze
as hard and pointed as a drill through his skull
ed drives wilson back to his motel
ed still not quite sure who hes dealing with
is this really or merely a grieving dad
what you gonna do man
you gonna go to the cops
nah coppers dont do nothing do they
those streets up in the hills man
gotta be real careful keep your eye on the ball
two oclock in the morning its dark your mind is all agitated youre drivin a little too fast
beat those curves dont kid around
could be talking about the girl
wilson doesnt move
but touch him hell explode
out the window lights are passing but no landmarks
he might as well be on the moon
you should talk to elaine
that was her best friend
she didnt write to me did she
she didnt know what to say
shrugs i thought someone should say something
with me it was i dont know jenny liked me for some reason
i felt like i owed her
whod jenny get it off of this grass or whatever
self conscious again not me man
im no drug dealer what you think
re eds tattoos i think you didnt get that lot in the navy doing your national service
i already told you man
know what that is
nicks a nick n it
no matter what state youre in
state of remorse most likely for gettin caught
but thats not me anymore
thats when i was into the gang lifestyle
thats not who i am now
five years in the joint thats it for me man
now wilson drops the clanger
just got out meself didnt i
and ed turns
looks at wilson
fellow ex con
wilson out of the car shuts the passenger door
ed on the other side looks over the roof at him
go home man
plane taking off in background get on a plane
wilson has other plans
ill be needing a shooter
makes his fingers like a gun
and a clicking sound
comes quickly over youre kiddin me right
what do i do then look in the bleedin yellow pages
an urgent whisper these are not guys you can just go run a number on man
looking around thought perhaps thered be dispensing machines you know
bung in your coins come out with a
magnum fully loaded
ed throws up his hands walks back to his drivers side door
are you a resident of california
you gonna fill out forms man
do the background check
go through a three day waiting period
gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where ive skived off to
man you crazy
they shouldntve let you outta your country much less prison
travelling on a dodgy passport n all
walks round to come face to face with ed once more
which is why i thought save some time get what i need under the table like
as if resigned and mulling the problem over under the table
hundreds of tables
under bright lights
displaying every kind of firearm
handguns rifles shotguns parts to make machine guns
a weapons bazaar
even a cool customer like wilson cant help but be impressed by americas loving embrace of senseless mayhem
touting their wares
trying out pistol grips or pushing baby carriages
guys in fatigue jackets with toddlers on their shoulders
women in stretch pants looking for a little something in personal protection
doesnt know where to look
at the booth featuring classic cowboy collectibles or the most obese couple hes ever seen who just walked by
attention the long range vermin shooting panel is due to commence in two minutes in the blue room at the rear of the convention center
and other anomalous oddball announcements in the background as long as were here
at a booth selling laser attachments
beamsight ii is easily mountable on any shotgun rifle or sidearm and will project a small bright red dot directly onto the point where your weapon is aimed
for purposes of display a smiling young woman is the target
walking past almost subliminally noting the young woman with the symbol of death on her
passed from a dealers hand to wilsons
man knows what he likes
hell talk if wilson wont lookin good
while wilson checks thats a high end item
whatd you call that the protector
wont find a better cqc on the market
wilsons eyes glance up but ed asks the question
close quarters combat
keep one in my own home
trouble is im not at home see
fancied a bit of target shooting yknow while im here with me mate
nods at ed
where you from
sighting the weapon only we saw there was a show on thought i might pick something up for a price type of thing
you came to the right place sir
my wifes second cousin is english
well scotch irish
can i interest you in a holster
just luck this really
never been to one of these before
youre in gun country now my friend
picks up another checks it out been to the boat show
re wilsons new selection packs a punch but its compact has accessible features makes a nice concealed carry piece
playing the reluctant buyer he dont have a concealed weapons permit
dont have time for a lot of paperwork yknow
just popped over on a quick visit
i can take care of the paperwork
if you dont have a problem with me reporting this gun stolen
a look of understanding between them
not at all
to ed do we
not me man
i mean its already a steal nit what you said four hundred for this one
well ill have to add another two hundred on top of that
another look for the paperwork
nervous at wilson handling his new gun purchase beside him
violation of my parole this
a perfect pause goin abroad
ed shakes his head at wilsons sense of humor
you hadda show up on a weekend
wouldntve even been a gun show
for another month
fucking out of order that
shouldnt be allowed
as he puts away a box of ammo
you gonna take your new arsenal go visit terry valentine just like that
boom bam boom
its only insurance
cant be too careful
this terry valentine hes probably a wonderful fella
they were together how long
five years i think
well there you are
jen mustve liked him
doesnt make ed feel any better
nor does the way wilson seems now to be studying eds driving techniques
paying attention to the way traffic lights and left turn lanes and cars without clutches work over here
remembering jenny told me she met him at the beach
got blinded by his smile
beat you believe that shit
son of a bitch never smiled at me
buried her at a private service
private for who
confused hang about
i thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with jenny
he came in with jenny to the restaurant where i work
thats not where they met
and thats where you met jenny
no no jenny used to work as a waitress
before she met him
but thats not where she met me
not in my restaurant
howd the two of you hook up then
oh jenny was in my acting class
wilson at the wheel himself
getting the hang of l
along one of the major boulevards
glances at a street sign as he goes by
picks up the map book on the seat beside him to check his route
wilson makes a sudden lane change to avoid getting fed in the wrong direction
gets honked by another driver
wilson cruises past a particular building
we dont have to really clearly see it just yet we saw it in the flash cuts more important we see him seeing it
casing it with the eyes of a professional
sniffing it out the instinct of a predator after prey
produces the little leather travel kit we saw him unpack at his motel
under the usual assortment of clippers razors etc
is a hidden layer storing still more personalized items a set of select slim lockpicking cutting tools
wilson locks the car
stay with him
he walks down the block
a nice long walk
what we get out of it besides a sense of wilson cool cat ambling along loner sun beating down not bothered his shadow doubling him is this the building approaching
the one he has his eye on
its across the street
a kind of flat windowless warehouse with adjoining loading yard
loading yard surrounded by a chain link fence topped with barbed wire
the actual geography of where he left his car in relation to this building
safely around the corner
and how he might practically get back to it either this same way or via a more circuitous route round another block
the sense you get in downtown l
on a lazy saturday afternoon that youre in a ghost town
particularly in this shabby kind of industrial section
wilson crosses over to it now
from sunny to shade
walks past the chain link fence
the padlocked gate big enough to accommodate the couple of trucks parked within the compound
walks past the closed security door which would appear to be the buildings main entrance
round the next corner sees theres a steel back door as well
comes around this block again
looking surreptitiously around now
streets here utterly deserted
not even a passing car
crappy residential building on an opposite corner spanish music blaring from one of the open windows but not with a direct view on the loading yard fence on this side
wilson nearing it now taking something out of his pocket
one of the mysterious metallic tools from his travel kit
snaps his wrist unfolding the tool with a crack
he doesnt go for the gate the padlock like we might have thought
he suddenly drops to one knee in shadow where the fence meets the adjoining building
snap snap snap snap snap so quick with great dexterity though his face grimaces with the strength he has to exert with each application of pressure he cuts just as
many links as he knows he needs to push in a little flap of fence and roll under
whole thing accomplished in seconds
walks fast to the cover of the trucks
cement loading docks and bays
he jumps up to one puts his ear to the metal
scans the wall for any sign of an alarm box or anything
then cocks an ear upwards
camera craning up to show us what he hears an air conditioning unit humming away
which means someone must be inside
wilson looks back at his entry options
not the loading doors but a conventional door at one end with a conventional lock his eye zeroes in on
gets out his tools going over
a scratching at the door
he starts along the hallway
a supervisor the one from the flash cuts does a double take as wilson passes
wilson stops and turns
howd you get in here
coming over what the hell are you doing here
looking for a bloke named valentine
meat puppets who we saw before as well who work here gathering
the supervisor and the meat puppets exchange glances
hes expecting you
beat i doubt it
the supervisor moves toward wilson
so why would he want to see you
i have a message for him
about jennifer wilson
more looks are exchanged
you know her
i know her all right
she came down here once stirred up a shitstorm
we lost a full days work took me weeks to get back on schedule
if she hadnt a been terrys woman i wouldve broke her jaw
course shes nobodys problem now
wilson stares at him
is valentine here
what do you think
wilson looks at the meat puppets the loading area
where is he then
listen get the fuck out of here before you get hurt
who the fuck do you think you are waltzing in here asking questions
wilson just looks at him
do you hear me asshole
the supervisor shoves him
the meat puppets move a little in anticipation
wilson isnt giving any indication that hes going to leave
jesus you really want your ass kicked dont you
he pushes wilson again hard
go on get outta here
he pushes wilson again
still wilson wont leave
this time he tries to slap wilson
wilson blocks the supervisors hand and then punches him hard
the supervisor stumbles back and falls to the floor
move to wilson
he tries to fend them off but there are too many
they beat him
when they find that hes armed they beat him harder
wilson is taken outside and dumped
after a moment he gets to his feet
reaches for another gun tucked in his lower back
he re enters the building
we hear several shots
seconds later one of the meat puppets comes stumbling out of the door terrified
he runs past us fast
a moment later wilson emerges gun in hand
you tell him
you tell him im coming
a series of images that prove valentine whoever he is has taste wealth and influence stretching back a good three decades at least
walking through some of these shots is a young beauty in a bathing suit named adhara
she advances slowly not entirely sure of herself and stops to look at things just like we do
at one point she looks to see a beefy guy gordon sitting at the kitchen counter flipping through a magazine
he looks her up and down more from reflex than anything
she continues on
eventually she emerges through sliding glass doors and on to a patio
a figure by the pool talking on the phone
his back to us
the pool is spectacular mosaic tile bottomed
approaches then sits beside him
his voice is soothing but with the tiniest hint of exasperation that comes with being slightly ahead of everyone
into phone not before
not before think about it
what does it mean
what no im not
you figured it out all by yourself
are we done
he hangs up stands still doesnt turn
i told your father if youre looking for a name you cant go wrong with a constellation
i used to hate it
now i like it
could be worse he couldve named you reticulum
he turns and we see him for the first time
especially when hes smiling like he is now
he leans over and kisses her
is there anything in the world that you want or need
want to know why you need that scary guy in your house
hes been with me for years
hes not as tough as he looks
then what good is he
is it possible that youre too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty
is that a problem
not for you clearly
im loyal to things that make me happy
am i a thing
well youre certainly not a person
youre not specific enough to be a person
youre more like a vibe
im so glad were having this chat
its not a knock
its not a compliment
its an observation
like im hungry
when are we eating
as soon as you get dressed
what kind of food
anything but japanese
im not into finger foods
i dont like do it yourself cuisine
you demand to be served
a fork fetishist
its just fuel to me
im not there for distractions
for some eating is a sensual experience
the sensual experience
thats what gordons always saying
his cell phone rings
into phone yes
he listens then looks up at his balcony where a man avery stands holding a phone obviously talking to valentine
into phone ill be there as soon as i can
he hangs up
valentine contd we can leave as soon as youre ready
valentine approaches avery
theres been some trouble downtown
what the papers used to call a gangland slaying
our black friends
they dont work like that
jenny wilsons father paid a little visit left a message
i thought he was in prison in england
well either they have a very liberal work release program or hes out because hes here in l
looking for you
valentine is a little ruffled
maybe avery likes that
what do we do
we wait and we watch
valentine just looks at him
adhara approaches valentine who stands staring at the pool
not who food
should we get italian
turns to her
valentine contd yes
are you ready
as long as i dont have to pass gordon again
im never ready for that
he smiles rises and offers her his hand
i know another way out
she takes it
elaine on her way in
intelligent capable looking
passes wilson whos leaning somewhere smoking
aware as a wary woman will be of a strange mans presence without necessarily having looked at him
well aware too that he stayed where he was so she unworriedly unlocks the buildings security gate and goes through to the inner and closes the gate behind her now
seeing him amble up arriving as it clicks shut between them
hes looking at her a certain way
she looks back
youre jennys father
and the recognition on his part had a feeling it was you
you look alike
cigarette in hand perhaps it was the smoke
not her brand
she used to pinch em off me
trying to defuse elaines cold stare funny that
one thing she never tried to get me to stop
elaine doesnt soften
why did you come here
wanted to talk to you didnt i
no why did you come here
sort a few things out
been busy have you
how dyou mean
its been a while
i was skint didnt have no money to get here
thats not what i heard
what was that then
i heard you were whats that adorable phrase
at her majestys pleasure
it was the bars then
indicating his face viewed by elaine through the barred security gate that divides them
in any case i dont suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel
never did an honest days work in my life dear
wasnt about to start when i was in stir not with all that leisure time on my hands
and not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out
from the wembley staduim job wasnt it
pink floyd concert receipts
jenny wouldve been
fourteen at the time
trying to conceal his surprise hardly buried
earning interest love
earning interest in an offshore account
tidy little premium per annum that
well that kind of security cant be bought
must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you
she turns to walk away
here arent you gonna let me in
without looking back try calling me again
she comes in
a modest studio apartment
puts her bag on the kitchenette countertop
glances at her answer machine to see if she has any messages
the phone rings
she sits down glumly on her couch holds her head in her hands
wilson gives up starts to walk away
the gate buzzes
elaine opens the door
wilson in the hall
i was just going to toss some vegetable rolls in the microwave open a can of diet soda
beat want to take me out
wilson and elaine at a table
no i went in for more improving pastimes
philosophy classes language courses european history all that lark
did you know that in paris in the eighteenth century there were more rats in peoples houses than there were people in peoples houses
sounds like beverly hills
here are you always this sarky
maybe ill mellow when my ship comes in
its expected any day now
im all packed and ready to go
werent you on a television series
has he seen it
if it played in england somebody owes me money
who told you that eddie
yes said it went on for donkeys years
they found thats the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of mormons on the chisum trail
blinks coquettishly i was wife number three the ingenue
oh it just ended then
now whos being sarcastic
when youve lost as many years as i have love puts things in perspective know what i mean
i guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went
raises her drink it mustve been the bars
their food arrives
its a kind of prison doing a series
early to bed early to rise no time off for good behavior you grab the boodle for as long as it lasts
the kicker only difference is you cant get arrested afterwards
wilson appears fascinated by the cold glasses of water on the table
ice cubes clinking as he holds his
a busboy bringing them to other people too just like that without anyone even asking
i cant believe jenny told you all that
she was always so embarrassed
wilson looks at her
she never told eddie though
she never told anyone else
making light now about the convict strain or is it stain
no i was privileged
i was someone who helped jenny efface her past
howd you manage that then
when im not honing my craft in episodic television i do double duty as a voice coach
not that her accent would have hobbled her progress
not with that look
yeah well she started all that in london
learnin ow to speak proper
putting it on a bit there
then upper crust central school of speech and drama
its no doddle gettin in there yknow
they offered her a place at rada n all only shedve had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on was jenny
she could talk posh without any training when she was knee high to a grasshopper
indicating himself show up the old man you know
elaine smiles slightly
none of this information new to her
but warming to this man
you werent disappointed in her then
how could i be
course i wasnt
she was twenty one when she came to me
looks at him straight from leaving you
footloose and fancy free
she was happy here
however the two of you might have parted
dont think she wasnt
its because wilson thinks the opposite that hes here
looks at elaine
thats the trouble n it
hard as nails again she enjoyed life
they walk along the seafront
we hear the ocean but cant see it
when did you get in
occurs to her you havent been lurking outside my building all day
no i had some other matters to attend to you know
getting a car sorted
i mightve been away for the weekend
well i reckoned saturday night if you were goin out youd probably have to come home first
and youve seen eddie rama
yeah saw eddie yeah
me and him are muckers
makes a kind of bonding gesture
i should really give him a call
hes a character isnt he
well not to you
i meant to us squares in the outside world
he give me your address
i gave him yours
said here you want to write i think this is a relative
i guess i thought i was being true to jenny
who told me she didnt have a father before proceeding of course to tell me why
well dont suppose she did really most of her life
on her own after her mum died
aunts and uncles for a time and then the bright lights beckoned
were you still married at the time to jennys mother i mean
nah we split up when jenny was six
her second husband done a runner after she got sick
they give me compassionate leave from parkhurst to go visit her in hospital
we were always mates me and jennys mum
i like to think theyre together again now
the address jenny gave me that wasnt a prison was it
nah accommodation address
whats that like a p
something like that yeah
where you get your bank statements
wilson gives a laugh
well you gotta have something permanent dontcha
even if its a hole in the wall
no matter which jug i might be transferred to i always got someone on the out checks up on it for me see
anything i need to know comes round on visitors day word in my ear
wilson leans on the wall overlooking the black ocean
sound of waves gently lapping the beach
i already knew
when was it supposed to have happened
two oclock in the morning eddie said
watching him thats what was estimated
eight hours difference between here and london
wouldve been what ten in the morning my time
i was just coming out on the yard
now i was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then
bit of fresh air stretch me legs well stretch the day out really thats what you wanna do
and ill tell ya i couldnt open the paper
could not pry the pages apart it was like they was glued together
thats how weak my hands went
thought i was having heart attack only i knew i wasnt
bloke come up to me he says dave he says youve gone all white
i said fuck me ive been in prison half my life what dya expect
but he was dead on cause i could feel the blood drain right out of me head
and i knew
beat something had happened to jen
they stand here a while
listening to the breakers hit the shore
they come in
make yourself at home
that gets her a look
theres nothing i cant afford to lose
she goes to make coffee
wilson looks around
do you even know who terry valentine is
well i gathered something from the article what eddie sent me
some sort of pop music producer wasnt it
maybe a smile from elaine at the quaintness of pop music
rock n roll is what we called it
hes sort of a forgotten figure now but back when the west coast was the grooviest place on earth terry valentine was where all the happenings happened
more of a kind of promoter i guess whatever that means
just took that whole southern california sixties zeitgeist and ran with it
packaged and sold it
made out like a bandit
watching as adhara undresses either deliberately for him or just casually
she smiles as she notices hes looking
whats he done lately
that line pregnant with meaning
elaine looks at him
avoids answering the question actually implied there
brings a tray over lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing
like me but on a grander scale of failure
now you shouldnt run yourself down
my employer mr
lindgren your employer
what line is he in
proprietor of a london firm
based in london but with international concerns
various enterprises style of thing
i thought you said you never did an honest days work in your life
well not to say mr
lindgren is dishonest exactly
she gets the picture right
anyhow hes always saying to me dave never run yourself down son cause therell always be plenty of people willing to do it for you
in what capacity are you employed by this mr
this and that
ways and means
when he wants someone run down youre willing to do it for him
they sort of come together in mutual understanding and sit down
so whats the deal
you and terry valentine at twenty paces
is that what this is about
are you serious
have you ever known me not to be
elaine looks away you fuckin guys and your dicks
whatd you want me to do
stay at home twiddlin me thumbs
doing sweet f
you dont believe it was a car accident
what do you think
terrys never going to give you satisfaction
not the type
depends don it
what makes you so certain
ill bloody well ask him
theres the phone
you want his number
that look again
i got his number
im not going to help you
she goes into a bathroom
shutting the door behind her
bites into a cookie
thickets part and we see wilson scrambling up a rather steep hill
coming to a ridge where he settles down to look at something o
his expression changes by degrees from curiosity to dawning realization to a kind of frustrated disappointment
ed sits in here radio on
wilson appears out of the brush gets in
ed turns the radio down
mindful of the odd car driving past told you you wouldnt be able to see through that gate
i had a butchers at the house
alarmed whod you butcher at the house
doesnt anyone speak english in this fucking country
i dont much reckon those minders of his
hes brought in the heavy mob
they look a right load of wallies
patrolling back and forth outside the gate all ponced up like the fuckin household cavalry
ducks suddenly watch it
as one of the bodyguards runs by only fleetingly glimpsed by us
that was one of them
sits up again see what i mean
wearing bloomin uniforms n all
off eds perplexed look
wilson settles into position again this time with ed
look at that
ed just laughs
whats so fucking funny
those arent guards
now we see what wilson had mistaken for valentines private army
half a dozen valets outside valentines hilltop home
dressed in matching attire a couple of them wielding walkie talkies
eds still laughing
what dya mean valets
what is he then the earl of fucking doncaster
valets they park cars
hes having a party
wilsons car pulls up
he and ed get out
wilson engages in a mini tug of war with a valet over his car key it so rubs him the wrong way having to give it up
keep it handy mate all right
were not stopping long
he gestures apparently getting the message across that he wants the car kept close by
exchanges the key for a card which he turns over in his hand and studies curiously as they head inside
arent we all la de da
nervous being here i thought you just wanted to check out the house man
well thats what were doin n it
no one else is even here yet
first in first out thats me
looking over to note the multi car garage off the main house
wilson and ed are among the first to arrive
a smattering of other guests
elaborate catered cuisine
they mosey over to the wet bar
what can i get you
suggesting ed take first crack dubonnet with a twist
tomato juice and tabasco sauce
by now his whole dynamic with ed is a verbal tease
to bartender got a coke
valentine is checking himself in a full length mirror
tv on in background sound low entertainment week
not quite satisfied valentine crosses to the bathroom
valentine takes one more closer look
you have the same posters
is lounging in the large tub
staring dreamily at a couple of framed posters on the walls more s psychedelia
that you have down at your office
valentine sits on the edge of the tub
with a nostalgic air as he looks at her the embodiment of youth
he strokes her wet skin
they kiss lightly
i like the colors
we all did
it mustve been a time
a golden moment
have you ever dreamed of a place
you dont really recall ever having been to
a place that probably doesnt even exist except in your imagination
somewhere far away half remembered when you wake up
but when you were there you spoke the language you knew your way around
significant pause that was the s
with that exit line practiced
he starts to go
then pauses turns again
no it wasnt
comes back to her
faraway look in his eyes
comes back to now that was all
wilson wanders around exploring the house
comes to a wall of photographes
casually scanning them as he passes slowly by hes caught up short by one
a framed photo of jenny his daughter
a series of emotions play over his face
he turns sees valentine coming down the stairs
valentine joins the party without noticing him
ed peruses the available food
valentine comes over to check it out
glances at ed without recognizing him
and goes away
leaving ed more nervous than ever
wilson has come up here
peeks into one room
moves along to another the master bedroom
opens the door gently
adhara is still enjoying her bath
aware that someones in the adjoining bathroom
the soft ripple of water from in there
perhaps he even glimpses her through the door as he boldly looks around
he notices a video camera on a tripod a cord running to the television
suddenly we hear the chirp of a cellular phone
she gets out of the tub and goes for the nearest towel
quickly wrapping herself she exits
adhara enters and goes for her purse
she pulls the ringing phone out and answers it
you got my message
no crestview terrace not crestview place
yeah theres like three different ways up the hill the quick way is to bear to the right
she hangs up and begins toweling her hair
after a moment she stops
something isnt right
she looks around the room and her eyes stop on the tv
her brow furrows trying to place the familiar image on the screen a girl towel drying her hair by the bed
she looks over to see the video camera which has been turned on and pointed toward the bed
shes not sure if its funny or creepy
valentine mingling all smiles and movement
at the foot of the stairs
watches him all stillness and intensity
catches wilsons eye for a nanosecond does a subtle double take then moves on
adhara dressed looking great exits the bedroom and heads for the stairwell
adhara descends the stairs
turning to see her as she comes down
makes her way across the room to valentine
hey i thought you werent a buffet person
im a gracious host
watching them when excuse me
wilson looks at him
dont you work with ian
i could swear i met you with ian at the emi offices in london
unless im not who i think i am
thats too bad
ians got a good thing going over there
turned that place completely around
what i like about ian he believes in a chain of command but not a chain of respect you understand what im saying
chain of respect
thats good that
i really admire the guy
good to meet you
the guy leaves
wilson sees that adhara is now on the other side of the room separated from valentine
he heads for her
still dealing with people desperate to be the focus of his attention
he notices talking in a corner
she seems attentive
in a series of cuts still being the gracious host still keeping his eyes on who in a series of cuts continue to talk
finally they separate wilson heading outside onto a deck
excuses himself from a group of sycophants and goes to her
valentine approaches and begins talking to her low
after a few moments of conversation they both look toward on the deck outside
joining ed whos taken refuge out here with a plate of food
what wilson cant belleve when he sees it is that behind valentines house which is on top of a high hill is nothing but desolate scrub canyon
on the other side of the railing around the deck which is surely less than regulation height is a sheer drop into an abyss
wilson contd jumps back with only slightly affected vertigo flipping heck
ed a little more accustomed to l
architecture nods in agreement
if you could afford a house like this you would buy a house like this
wilson edges forward to the rail again
what are we standing on
they stand there looking out
quite a view once you get used to it
ed contd nods to the hazy distance you could see the sea from here if you could see it
but now ed gives wilson a nudge seeing that valentine inside the house is making his way out here
why dont you go nick one of those little cooker whats its warming up the sausages cocktail and meet me in the garage
look about for a toolbox while youre at it
his is not to reason why
ed moves off
valentine steps up smile fully loaded
he extends his hand
wilson shakes it
have we met
theres something i cant quite emi in london
i work with ian
you must know ian
really turned things around there
i suppose thats good unless things were fine the way they were
oh i think a shake up was in order
otherwise people get lazy dont they
start thinking they can get away with things
gotta shake em up now and again make em pay attention
wilson looks at him
valentine looks back
something about those eyes
the excited guy appears tugging at valentine
glad i got to meet you
be seein you
the excited guy ushers valentine away
wilson watches him go
charles grodin is here
ed displays the sterno
ed points to a table where a toolbox sits
wilson crosses to it begins going through the contents
put the sterno on the ground near the center of the garage
wilson pulls a brace and bit from the toolbox and crosses to the rear of one of the cars
dropping to the ground he bores a hole in the gas tank
ed raises his eyebrows and moves toward the door
wilson crosses to the other car and puts a hole in that gas tank as well
then he puts the brace and bit back in the toolbox and heads for the exit ed right behind him giving a quick backward glance
spills out slowly but steadily and slithers toward the garage door
wilson and ed walk briskly along the path
gives ed parking ticket bring the motor around
bang out in front right
you goin back inside
one thing i need
valentine is talking to gordon his beefy bodyguard and looking around
he stops as he sees wilson once again stepping onto the deck
he points wilson out to gordon who nods and heads for the deck
ed hands the ticket to a valet
he exchanges looks with a couple of the other valets
valentine is talking to adhara who is introducing her girlfriend
as valentine greets her he glances outside where gordon is approaching wilson on the deck
wilson sees gordon approaching
gets ready to greet him
removes cigarette from mouth drops it to floor of deck presses it out under his shoe
limbers up his shoulders in a subtle way
gordon coming towards him
as if to challenge wilsons legitimacy as an invited guest
about to speak
but wilson doesnt even give him a chance to do that
in quick succession wilson head butts gordon splintering his nose knees him in the groin then using the knee for leverage grabs gordon by the lapels and heaves him over
it happened so fast that if anyone else is nearby they probably didnt even notice or didnt readily grasp what they saw
valentine had turned his attention back to adhara and her girlfriend
when he glances back to the deck hes a little concerned not to see gordon anywhere out there anymore just wilson coming back in
adjusting his jacket walking back through the house
behind him people are rushing to the railing and looking over
a few yells of call an ambulance
moves that way
moving across the room towards the front door
they are heading right toward each other
pass each other eyes locked almost dream like
wilsons eyes cold though with the hint of a smile
valentine throws a last look back before reaching the deck
valentine pushes through to look over the railing
gordon a crumpled inert heap way down the hill below
turns to look toward the front door
wilson not to be seen
valentine pushes through the crowd toward the door
valentine emerges in time to see ed and wilson pulling away
wilson looks at him impassive through the passenger window
is just arriving in his car
valentine gestures at him
suddenly we hear a loud bass heavy whhuuummmppp
valentine and a few others turn toward the sound which came from there is smoke coming from under the door
wilsons car practically tobogganing back down the hill
we hear an explosion from back up the hill
ed jumps though hes driving
the gas pedal his most pressing concern
negotiating the dangerously winding road comes second
exhilaration mixed with panic
you steady on man
what the fuck else did you do back there
an especially sharp curve looms ahead
flinches grabs a handhold
car makes it around on two side wheels
ed regains control
in his car takes a different turn
swerves some more curves
should be some sense here that a similar skyline route would have been taken by wilsons daughter on her final drive
why didnt you just kill him you had the chance
that would be too easy
hes gotta know why
you think a fuckin guy like that ever will
what more do you want man
suddenly out of nowhere a side street bam
another car shoots out to cut them off sideswiping them
wilsons car skids into a spin from the impact
chased them via a shortcut down the mountain
now jumps out of his car levels a shotgun at them and pumps off a blast
the trunk pops open as the car rights itself
avery fires again but the upended trunk is a kind of shield deflecting the shot
despite the fact that ed is still in the drivers seat and managed rather skillfully to avoid crashing wilson acts like hes not there grabs the steering wheel jams the
car into reverse virtually sitting on ed as he pounds his own foot onto the gas pedal and with his ferocious eyes monitoring the door mirror steamrolls the car backwards towards avery
wilson reverses his car like a speeding tank smashing into averys car
pushing it right off the edge of the road
falls backwards to the ground as he gets the hell out of the way
jumps out of his car
advancing on avery with it pointed
crashing through underbrush down the steep bank of the hillside
sound of the divebombing car over
another pointed echo of his daughters fate
their eyes meet momentarily
and before wilson can shoot avery rolls over the edge of the road himself
calls frantically to wilson from their car
sirens in the distance
that consuming rage overtaken him again for a second
but the exigencies of the moment snap him out of it
turns on a dime goes back to the car
before hes halfway in eds driving them away again
trunk at the back banging up and down up and down
pulls himself back up to the road
brushing himself off
looking the way they went
he gently tosses his shotgun down into some thick brush where maybe hell retrieve it later
avery returns sweating walking back up the road to where all the action is
party guests milling outside waiting for their cars so they can leave
a fire truck a police car
smoke pouring out of valentines garage
valentine finishes talking to a couple of cops
walks over to avery
you should have let me do the talking
why because youre my security consultant
insecure this cocksucker nearly burnt my house down
more concerned about police presence what did you tell them
valentine blows air runs a hand through his hair
i told them a long time employee flipped out
had a drug problem refused counselling
set the garage on fire then committed suicide
one of my guests tried to stop him but how do you stop gordon in this context meaning how did that rangy englishman do it
i mean gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds
heavier than that now
but are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story
as it happens
i didnt make that part up
and where is this guest
dont they want to interview him
i dont know everyone here
he was so traumatized he split
another notion maybe he was gordons pusher avery stares at valentine
impressed at him thinking on his feet
where do you think he is mike
already turning well find him
stops him no
not even your people should be involved
its too close now
you could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here
you think im staying
theres already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons
well can we make it one more
nowhere the fuck near me
hes being glib but hes being serious
his open handed gesture inquiring of avery are you up to the task
i have other resources
he turns to go
the huge dead bulk of gordon hoisted back up to the deck by a paramedic team
valentine comes back in
in the living room beyond adhara stands anxiously where shes been waiting for him
cops visible outside on the deck peering over the edge
heading that way
something peripherally had caught his eye and he returns to it
his wall of photographs
the one that had contained the picture of jenny
safely down the hill
driving away in traffic ed calmer now
pulls the rolled up photograph of his daughter out of his jacket and looks at it
two characters stand leaning against a back wall
staring ahead without purpose
halfheartedly watching a game of pool in progress
just hanging out
strange threatening characters
one of them is young
lean hungry looking
stacy is his name
a shrewd scheming kid
but definitely a little unhinged
weirder is his companion
the title isnt one of courtesy
hes an actual blood relative
maybe years older than stacy
but intellectually younger
physically much bigger
the man is huge
nevertheless the safer of the two until stacy tells him otherwise
way theyre standing next to each other suggests the ease they feel in each others company
theyre good buddies
stops to look around
spots his two freaks
walks toward them
a mysterious black man has followed avery in
thompson is his name
he hangs back and watches
stacy turns to see him
uncle john looks vacantly
come over here
that was in the way of an order
he nods around the corner where its less crowded
stacy stops uncle john from following and goes after avery
at the bar
keeping his eye on them
alone with stacy
how they goin kid
howd you like to kill someone for me
avery gives him an envelope
same as last time the rest after
pockets it where do we go
when you find the guy youll know
what shit is this
i just do it
i dont prepare it
ill point you in the right direction but youll have to take it to the end zone
hes a hit and run gunman i figure hes not cruising the polo lounge
this is un fucking professional
see a successful man like me has limitations i lose touch at a street level
so i have to depend on a smart boy like you whos closer to the nitty and the gritty than i am
fuck you mr
whatever your name is
this is a lifestyle i embrace
thats why im letting you take care of this
im the one with appearances to maintain
but who gives a shit about you
not even god
wilson on the bed
watching tv access hollywood
knock at door
he turns down the tv
from the springs under the bed
looks carefully through the peephole in the door
elaine has come to visit
lets her in
after closing the door resumes his position on the bed
elaine looks around
i was in the neighborhood
i come down here quite a bit
watch the planes taking off
re this motel study the architecture of early david lynch
but she doesnt really have it in her to be ironic right now
leans back against the door
wilson remains silent
hes done the same to elaine now that he did to ed
almost magically induced her to a confessional verge
elaine too isnt sure she wants to be complicit in this revenge tragedy
but here goes jenny was supposed to come to my place that night
she called me asked if she could come over
she and terry had been having some trouble
i dont know about what
on this occasion it reached some sort of crisis point
she told you all about my details but not about his
shed never called me like that before
she sounded more
pissed off angry than upset or afraid
but she never turned up
i called the house but only got the answer machine
when they found her
shed been going the wrong way
not the direction shed have gone if shed been coming to see me
or coming straight to see me
maybe she just wanted to drive
she looks at wilson
measured how did you come to have my address
found it did you
among her things
you think terry gave me access to her things
probably sold her clothes
gently urging and how did you get it
elaine looks at him
she gave me your address
elaine contd starting to realize not long before
realizing she said if anything ever happened
realizes thats how you know
thats why youre so sure
realization jennys telling you
shes sitting on the bed now
stacy putting on a jacket that says bomb hanoi comes out of the pool hall
uncle john in tow
taps pocket i got half
makin trouble for someone
the forever kind
thompson the mysterious black man watches them from the hall doorway
wilson and elaine
shes in pantyhose
fastening a bra
hes got trousers on reaching for a shirt
how longve you lived here
elaine sits on the bed fastening her skirt
her bra strap cuts across her bare back
this towns been chewing my flesh since
what we now refer to as the early s
thinks back christ my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me
i was away
tries to remember maidstone
these more highlights from the zagat prison guide
wilson looks at her shes the one who goes to bed with ex cons
you dont seem bothered
you dont know how ive compromised my standards
tell us about it
its too involved a lifetime of non involvement
anywhere else id be an interesting little number here im just sag number forty eight thousand and one
quickly sag meaning screen actors guild
oh i was gonna say
still there have been rewards
and some of the producers who call even have credits
i can see the attraction
she glances up at him to try and see how he means that
is he looking at her or out the window
what did you do
to make them take the early s away from you
a jewellers up the west end
we tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road
trouble was the bloody thing collapsed after wed made the grab n all
would you adam n eve it
you mean if theyd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess
we were lucky to be nicked
me and the lads went down there sunday evening we werent discovered till the monday
good job we were still breathing
it didnt discourage you though
from pursuing your chosen profession
ill tell ya something it made me a model prisoner
put me right off any escape attempts
tunnel my way to freedom after that experience
not bloody likely
i was inside once
i punched a cop at a demo
what was that in aid of
get seven years did you
what about just now
playful goes over ready for more overnight
you have been away
lies back regards him carefully or is all this just new to you
has to be said
i got off to a slow start
i dont believe it
didnt know where to look till i was
pushing the legal limit even then
he stands again vaguely disappointing her
me mate introduced me to a woman up the street
funnily enough she was married to a milkman
i said good is she
he said good listen mush its not that shes been around its that shes been around hell of a long time
he laughs uproariously at that
but the point is hes sort of complimenting both elaine and himself
theyve been around had their knocks theyve lasted
elaine remains unsmiling
still leaning back on her elbows on the bed in bra skirt hose no shoes
she asks again the question wilson avoided answering
your most recent incarceration
what was that for
and again he evades the answer she wants
it was for nine years
buttoning his shirt the last nine years
for the first time we see the pacific coastline
and a sleek italian sports car
valentine at the wheel
adhara besides him
ive lived in l
all my life ive never done this drive
all your life
that happened while i swam the length of my pool
adhara looks back over her shoulder
checking the road behind
whats the matter
i guess its hard to pass on this road
the freeways faster but lacks a certain majesty
just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time
i sure hope so
a big utility vehicle
with avery in the front passenger seat
and three bodyguards hes brought along to protect valentine
rick driving tom and larry in the back
all im sayin is travel time shouldnt be the same rate
travel time is down time right
i mean were not even in the same car as the client
to avery you told me the job was at the house
when we get to it
well are we shadowing the client right now or are we just going the same way
the company i was with in seattle these distinctions were made
now i dont dispute him getting the full whack
he means rick whos older seniority and all that
but if im getting paid the same hourly rate when were at the house as i am in this car that doesnt sit well with me and i feel obliged
to say so
cause in seattle what youre paying now for so called travel time was half what we got for actual clock time with the client
so i just feel we should get more when the job actually commences after this spineless whining weak willed sob story larry just turns to him and says id really
like to eat your pussy
stacy and uncle john sitting on a bench in a beach setting though we still dont see the ocean
or on some grass maybe in a little park opposite elaines building
in their own unique way
stacy commenting on fellow humanity all around them
time cuts between each comment after laughing loudly at a handicapped person i believe in mocking the afflicted
good for em
makes em stronger
uncle john picks at the grass or sand
as they kill the day
spotting a woman with a dog ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores
as a fat jogger passes good luck
watching someone else go by jesus are you gay enough or what
barely out of earshot of a black woman with dyed blonde hair very attractive
now i really want to fuck you
after a long time in silence just staring at someone you can always tell the ones wholl do anal
regarding some other beachgoers kinda makes you wonder why more people dont put a bullet through their fuckin skulls doesnt it
reading a newspaper looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth
leaning back on his elbows why dont they have tv shows about people whose daily lives youd be interested in watching
like skinny little weakling
or big fat guy
sick old man
family of losers
wouldnt that be good
sitting up two blacks and a mexican in a car
i dont know
observing a fast walker oh yeah keep doing that
thats really healthy
his gaze following another unfortunate cant you do something about your ass
his head turning after someone else other peoples lives scare the shit out of me
watching some guy rooting in a trash bin homeless people
remember when they were just bums
everyone with an axe to grind
like to grind in their face
pretty soon therell be shit in your pants rights groups
glad hes who he is and not who hes looking at wonder what its like being a dumb guy in a dumb suit trying to cross the street
staring at another sad couple life sure is a minefield
clocking another female look at that one
shes really been used
in a contemplative mode id love to be famous so i could snub ordinary people
imagine youre famous youre sitting in a restaurant some fool comes up to you wants you to sign your name on his napkin his wife is there it would be
something these poor saps would cherish the rest of their lives talk about to their cretin friends
you tell em to fuck off
god id love that
suddenly uncle john speaks
is that her
i bet thats her
across the street elaine comes out of her building
were supposing this is an apartment building somewhat worth living in that has outdoor parking of some kind visible from the street or only street parking
elaines car on the move
stacy and uncle john in a car following
unaware of the creeps in her wake
an x of elaine on their back seat
another picture of her on a page torn from a players directory
maybe she doesnt even know the english guy
driving avery said she was tight with his daughter
that dont mean nothin
stacy knows better than to argue with a moron
shes nice lookin
i just said shes nice lookin
and i said so what
you think shes any happier
what dyou mean any happier
any happier than any other asshole in life
i never met her
on screen a beautiful model but speaking in elaines at a mic
matching her voice to the models lip movements
looping this commercial or whatever it is
comes to a window where he can see elaine inside in the sound proofed studio
wilson and elaine talk while technicians change reels
they want southern i do southern they want midwest i do midwest they want tall blonde and twenty two im shit out of luck
pauses one thing i cant do is english
shouldnt even try
and laurence olivier couldnt do us
you ever been to london
only in the movies
ive ardly ever left it
yeah well youre here now re wilsons accent where urricanes ardly ever appen
ive got the hang of the driving
found this place all right
stick with me kid
looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes
elaine contd so is there anybody in your family whos not a criminal
not that i recall
what about your grandmother
nah she was married to me grandad he was as bent as a boomerang used to make knuckle dusters down the shop
crafty old sod
he alive to see this
shakes head dropped dead in the stalls in the odeon muswell hill
watching doris day
whatd your father do
black market during the war
elaine shakes her head
i guess youre just habitual
you sound like my fucking probation officer
wont he be looking for you about now
good luck to him
he couldnt find his prick if he didnt wear y fronts
minor officials bother you dont they
do us a favor
cant even go have a slash without em saying whatre you going in there for
elaine and wilson enter
stacy not far behind
catches outside gate before it slams shut
wilson and elaine turn the corner into the corridor approaching her apartment door
pause to kiss
and stacy appears at the other end of the hall
both arms stretched out with the
at the end of them
starts to squeeze off a shot
as wilson pushes elaine to the floor
as another shot rings out from further along the hall behind stacy
catching him across the cheek
only skimming him
but knocking him down
bullet chipping the wall
across from stacy
freezes his own gun in hand
three black guys
guns pointed at stacy and uncle john
hand on his
but a fourth black guy coming up behind him
wilson lowers the
flattened herself back against a wall
sits on the floor
holds his hurt face
thompson walks over and picks up stacys gun
one of the other blacks relieves a reluctant uncle john of his
stops at wilson come with us
if theres any doubt whether wilson will one of the blacks gently puts the muzzle of a gun to elaines head
cocks the hammer
they all go off down the stairwell
except stacy and uncle john
hit men wondering what hit them
like wilsons motel room another version of a cell
a small window high up
bricks and debris around the floor
and wilson and elaine
sitting leaning against opposite stone walls
tell me you wouldnt prefer a steady income
wilson takes a cigarette pack from a pocket
lights himself one
then tosses the stuff over to elaine
i got a steady income im on the dole
lights up a leech on the welfare state in addition
you dont miss a trick
i fiddle it
they got me down as an immigrant with five kids
elaine sort of shares a laugh at that
jenny spoke fondly of her imaginary siblings
though real ones might have been nice
this an unspoken thought between them
elaine contd do you remember the last time you saw her
last time might as wellve been the first
i remember all the times dont i
watching her grow up finding the word in increments
she told me you were a ghost in her life
daddy the friendly ghost
coming back to haunt her
well she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasnt in the royal marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of borneo or playing iago
in a worldwide tour of still you could never
do what she wanted
wilson shakes his head
she used to tell me shed turn me in
tries to laugh about it little kid
ten year old
if youre naughty dad ill tell on ya
she didnt want me sent down again see
when i was planning some job
ill tell em dad i promise i will
here look im calling the old bill right now picking up the telephone
i can see her the phone in her hand
became a sort of joke between us
only it wasnt a joke
she never would have turned you in not in a million years
i know that
but as time went on
well it wasnt a joke was it
she had a feeling about it about the last job how long id get the hook for
said she wouldnt be there this time when i got out
gun in hand
thompson leads wilson past a row of windows
dockyards harbor activity outside
toward a door with things stencilled on it
one of them us dept
a man named feather
half sitting on the edge of a table
wilson is shown in
wilson at the door
sizes feather up at a glance
this is where i come in
he walks confidently in
outside through the window an image of a foreign sports car being hoisted in the air by a crane
theres a chair
wilson sits in it
feather squints a little
seems ready to listen to whatever wilson has to say
wilson contd hows it going squire all right
now listen when i was in the nick second time it was no third
third stretch yeah
there was this screw had it in for me
that geezer was top of my list
two years after i was slung i saw him
he was sitting on a bench in holland park
there was no one else about
i coulda gone up behind him and snapped his fucking neck
but i left it
coulda nobbled him but i didnt
cos what i thought i wanted wasnt what i wanted
what i thought i was thinking about was something else
this berk on the bench wasnt worth my time
see what i mean
it didnt matter
it meant sod all in the end
feather has been listening to this expressionless
now he raises a finger as if theres a point he wants clarified
theres one thing i dont understand
wants to make this clear the thing i dont understand
is every motherfucking thing youre saying
look mush youre the guvnor here i can see that im on your manor now right
so theres no need to get out of your pram
im johnny come lately to all this
whatever the bollocks between you and this slag valentine its got nothing to do with me
i dont wanna know
well ill tell you
i believe this valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money
i can well believe it
im sure he has done son
hes about as straight as a dogs hind leg
but i cant be sure
i dont even know who he is
hes too insulated
too many layers around him
your guess is as good as mine mate
im here on another matter entirely
moves to window yeah i guess you are
good job your lot showed up when they did or it wouldve been me for the high jump
that dude who works for valentine
hes the one sent those guys after you
you know that
so whats your beef pal
moves to window i can see how all this import export malarkey might give rise to confusion where im concerned
a foreigner showing up unexpectedly like
looks at him it was you
all innocent eh
because that wasnt anything to do with me
and suspicion has been cast in my direction
pondering didnt make any sense
choosing those shitheads over me cutting me out of the deal then screwing them over too
no i can reassure you on that point
valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you
hed already grabbed more than his allotted cut
didnt think hed be so bold as to take all of it
all of what
of the deal man
oh yeah right
but if youre mad at him too and hes mad at you
that must make us pals
as you prefer squire
as you prefer
weary of his life in which case ill just do what i usually do
and that is
what am i doing
hes standing at the window staring out
as if wilson isnt even in the room any more
a ship being loaded out there
inspectors with clipboards
trucks like the ones we saw at that warehouse downtown
looking the other way
turns to go gotcha
along the way up the coast
through a window we see valentine and adhara enjoying a pleasant lunch
the bodyguards hang out by the cars outside with fast food bags and drinks
to rick i mean how much are you getting
just as a point of interest
see i didnt realize there was a sliding scale
at a payphone
his idiots in the background
dials a number
nasty bruise on his cheek
takes a cue off the rack
straight rotation no shit call your shot
theyre playing against a couple of other creeps

let him break he likes to break
i wouldnt talk
i saw your mother on the strip last night
she went up to three guys said shed like em to stick one in each know what i mean
creep rushes stacy
but doesnt get past uncle john
who drops him with one punch
flooring him between two pool tables
stacy then goes over
supports himself with a hand on each table swings his boot into the thugs face
bartender holds up phone
stacy goes over
bartender contd i can do without you inhibiting my business
stacy just scowls takes the phone
into phone yeah
goes back to uncle john
picks up his cue again
stacy contd weve been fired
someone weve never seen before and will never see again stands in valentines driveway
his name is fielding
a car comes up
another guy gramms sits in it
eventually fielding walks over
re the burnt garage valentine had himself a party i hear
by rote my client has already given a statement regarding yesterdays events
statement i wouldnt mind getting a statement
you see my client the united states government would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client
my client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment
youd have to be more specific
your client have a deal in long beach
how about downtown
theres some folks there oh wait theyre all dead
any of this ring a bell
my client is an entrepreneur
i am his lawyer not his business manager
so you wouldnt have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money
hes always been very forward thinking
he invested wisely
where is he now
he had urgent business in the north
gramms just laughs
just laughs and laughs
and we leave him laughing
and fielding not
ed takes off an apron heads out the door
its clear that hes not the head chef here because the head chef an anglo turns wondering where hes going

wilson next to him
opening a new cigarette pack
ive been wondering something

a little more pointed friends and colleagues you cant count on very many people thats the trouble
number of times a decent jobs been cocked up
little back seat sarcasm there
wilson looks kind of bitter
i was gonna do the post office once

the whole british bloody post office
i had a brilliant plan all worked out work of genius it was
could i get anybody interested
no theyre too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman
jumble sale on in watford theyll be up at the crack of dawn
youre just on a higher plane wilson
too bleeding true n it
flicks some cigarette pack paper out the window
the car speeds along
an impressive clifftop dwelling
isolated on a winding road
on a beautiful promontory overlooking the sea
valentine rings the doorbell actually chime
its opened by his ex wife
very well maintained
surprised to see him
but not overjoyed
what are you doing here
exercising my visitation rights
i miss my kids
theyre at college
or doesnt your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore
valentine goes inside
he looks around
she doesnt shut the door
youve made it
i dont want you here terry
sure you do
he turns to look at her
somehow it doesnt work on her
one of the reasons she divorced him
resigned to his presence
starts to close the door
valentine contd dont shut the door i have people with me
now she gets it
what kind of trouble are you in
susan sees adhara get out of the sporty car parked in the drive and stand against it in a posture of younger chick defiance
surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway
he actually puts his hands on her arms
to hold her firm while he locks onto her eyes
and doesnt smile
valentine contd i just need
away from l
for a couple of days
now the kicker i pay for this house too
susan reads him
hes not claiming ownership rights
hes telling her this house because of the connection to him is a target of some kind
what have you done
the land cruiser pulls up outside
avery emerges comes over comes in
susan notes the bodyguards out there as well
to valentine we werent followed
to susan susan
valentine lets susan go
knowing shes now speechless at whats turned into as far as shes concerned a home invasion
moving looking around wheres
whats his name fred you know his name is frank
is he here
you know i dont live with him
go to him
go to his studio or writers workshop or artists colony esselin retreat nudist camp are you finished
in a couple of days this whole thing whos looking for you
encouraging if not in fact ushering her towards a bedroom
its been five minutes and im packing to leave again
i cant believe this
thats right your life is shit and im to blame
its that simple
that does it
susan turns on him
it is that simple
i blame you for everything losing inhibitions and chicks without bras didnt have to lead to hardcore porno in every american household that was you the first on your block
to turn on a camera in a hot tub and peddle it to your friends
a little recreational pot didnt inevitably have to lead to the eventual devastation of the inner cities you made that happen the first time you bought a bigger stash than
you yourself meant to smoke
it happened when you made your first buck hyping some so called event that was over before it began or marketed some product whose only value was its instant disposability
you were the first person to see there was a lot of money to be made selling navajo rugs youve even stolen from the fucking indians
you looked at charlie manson when all he had to show for himself was a guitar instead of a knife and saw another merry prankster the freedom of the frontier
your pal here avery he saw gated communities
rich people coming to him with their money terrified of what people like you had left of this society
why invest in a marriage and children when you had him hes your oracle
but you couldnt even trust in friendship could you
still hes the dog you call for its dinner
because everything that might once have been fun or nice or sweet you had to turn mean and cold and sour
that was your genius terry
havent you read your own press
wilson and his friends pull in
get out of the car
finding herself at another shithole what is it you just like the reassuring smell of disinfectant
wilson just heads for the motel office
elaine and ed follow a little distance behind
you even know what hes saying half the time
no but i know what he means
adhara sways in a hammock
staring at valentine
wanting to know what the hell is going on
valentine stands smoking at the rail looking out over the dark sea
avery sits at a table
bodyguards visible inside the house
finally to avery do any of these guys cook
wilson at the car
elaine and ed watching
ed has gathered that something has developed between wilson and elaine
the way shes looking at wilson
reminds me of jennifer
barely perceptible nod hard to miss
i thought maybe you just came for the ride
id rather be with him than without him
i dont want to be found dead in l
wilson walks back to them
looking at ed as if to say ready to go
at her as if to say
evening has descended
surfaces glisten from a light drizzling rain
behind her outside way out of focus a figure slithers by
valentine and avery sit watching tv celebrity report
tom is behind them in the kitchen flipping through marie claire magazine
turns to look through the sliding glass doors
beyond the deck stands larry his back to us facing the ocean
looking toward the house larry in the foreground facing us
he takes a bite from a cinnamon granola bar then looks at it unhappily as he chews
looking at the house from the top of the hill
rick stands in the driveway next to valentines car smoking a cigarette
wilson and ed watching him
wilson nods his head to the left and ed moves in that direction
wilson moves quietly off to the right
valentine and avery still watching tv
re the channel check the news
avery starts looking around
wheres the remote
suddenly we hear a car alarm
tom looks up from his magazine
valentine looks to avery who shakes his head its nothing
rick turns and looks up the driveway toward the sound
he puts his cigarette out
larry has turned toward the sound as well
through a partially obscured side entrance he sees rick walking up the driveway
rick walks away from us toward the vehicle the land cruiser they drove here parked up the driveway
we lose sight of him as he crosses to the drivers side
the alarm goes off
we hold for several beats
he doesnt emerge
valentine and avery are still looking for the remote
avery stops his attention drawn to the fact that he hasnt heard anything from larry
he crosses to the window
the driveway car at the top partially visible
no sign of rick
his brow furrows
notices this looks out toward the backyard
same as before except larry isnt there
moves to the sliding glass door to get a better look at the deck and back yard
still no larry
leaves the window and moves to valentine
tom has joined them
after a beat turn all the lights out
ill get adhara
tom begins looking for the light switches
avery is already heading for the bedroom
stay away from the windows
avery exits the kitchen and takes the surrounding porch to the bedroom
are we seeing this from someones pov
adhara finished dressing looking at herself in the mirror
the lights behind her go off
she turns to see avery coming toward her to turn off the lights by the mirror
uh youve heard of knocking
i need you to come with me
why what he takes her by the arm
firmly but not roughly
she sees in his expression that something is up
tom and valentine have finally found the light switches and the room is dark
valentine moves slowly to the window takes a tentative peek
hard to see
is there something moving out by the shed
off i thought i said stay away from the window
entering the kitchen with adhara in tow
he brings her around behind the counter
everybody in the kitchen
valentine and tom move to join avery and adhara
behind the counter
everyone moves behind the large counter in the center of the kitchen and crouches down
they have a wall behind them and all the windows in front of them
scared whats going on
avery and tom have drawn their guns
we think someone is here
we cant find
what are their names
two of our guys
fucking typical larry and rick
did somebody call the cops
avery looks at valentine havent you told this girl anything
because because im taking care of it
you guys are fucking nuts im calling she starts to stand
valentine pulls her down
avery looks to tom who nods toward the back porch
a silhouetted figure is tentatively making its way along the porch trying not to be seen
we dont get a very clear glimpse
draws his gun and takes aim
careful not to become fully visible but growing more courageous with each step
locked on him waiting
puts adharas hand to her ears
we see a little more now than we have before
he sees enough
squeezes off a series of shots the muzzle flash strobing the kitchen area like a flashbulb adhara and valentine flinching
spinning and collapsing to the ground
lowers his gun
turns to tom
watch my back
avery moves out from behind the counter and heads for the body
avery makes his way to the figure which is on its stomach and writhing slightly
takes the gun and turns the body over
stares up at him choking on his last few breaths
what the hell is this guy doing here
he starts feeling around stacys jacket for anything useful but is interrupted when his hand explodes accompanied by the sound of a gunshot
he screams in pain
valentine and adhara drop to the floor
tom gun raised and pointing tries to see who shot avery
avery is turning toward his assailant but not fast enough
a shot rings out and part of his neck disappears in a blossom of blood
stunned he falls on his side gasping
close by huddled by the lip of the cliff
he starts to move cautiously toward avery and stacy
tom squints trying to see
a piece of uncle johns silhouette appears
fires at it
didnt hit anything
tom jumps up and runs for the living room firing his gun in front of him toward where he last saw uncle johns silhouette
tom runs through and reaches the sliding doors to the back porch
a portion of the frame splinters from a gun shot as he gains access to the other side of the back porch
tom is through the sliding doors and trying to make his way around to the driveway
crouched behind the opposite end of the porch sticks his head up
tom crossing to the steps slips on the damp wood tries to right himself
squeezes off two shots
is shot in the ankle as he is about to reach the steps
he yelps in pain tries to raise his gun
a shot flies over his head
tries dragging his shattered ankle to the steps
looks over the edge of the porch
tom turning toward the steps
fires at him
screams again as his elbow of his gun hand disintegrates
he slips on the first step and tumbles down the gun bouncing beside him
stands up to cross the back porch
takes a step forward but is stopped by a bullet in the chest about the only clean shot anybody makes
he looks down at himself
he looks up to see near death
gun in his good hand
he squeezes the trigger again
a small black hole appears in his cheek
he blinks begins to raise his hand to his face and collapses
exhales and rolls over
still trying to get to his feet
he gives up and just lies there panting
reaches for the gun beside tom
tilt up with it to reveal he puts the gun in his jacket and slides away
valentine and adhara are still stuck behind the counter
valentine sees the shadowy shape of ed slipping behind the back porch
decides to make a run for it following toms route away from ed
where are you going
valentine runs to the sliding door smack into standing there
he grabs valentine by the shirt and pushes him back into the room
bounces off the couch and onto the floor
comes toward him
grabs a lamp off an end table and hurls it at wilson
it careens off wilsons arm and shatters
is almost on him now
tries to scramble away
throwing anything he can get his hands on at
who keeps coming
he grabs valentine pulls him up then throws him into the television
crashes into the tv face first and bounces to the floor
goes to him grabs him by the neck with one hand and pulls out his gun with the other
he seems about to speak when suddenly he screams instead
has just stuck a kitchen knife into wilsons back
turns instinctively and whips the pistol around smashing adhara in the mouth
hits the ground
she wont be retaliating
in agony spinning trying to reach the knife in his back but its just beyond his reach
scrambles through the sliding glass door
valentine stumbles out
notices avery slumped on the deck mortally wounded
goes to him as if concerned but actually just to take the gun
then runs off the porch toward the steps that lead down to the sea
comes out after him the knife still in his back
so intent on catching valentine he fails at first to notice avery lying in the shadows
has just barely managed to reach stacys pistol
raises it weakly
points it at wilson
seems to feel it
locks eyes with avery
avery could already have shot him
but theres a momentary sense of recognition both of them just foot soldiers for fat cats and averys is not worth saving
lowers the gun
nods in the direction valentine went
wilson moves on
avery just lies there presumably to die
valentine hurries down the rickety steps
trying not to slip in the darkness though there are tiny malibu lights illuminating the steep and winding wooden framework
a rocky cove
valentine looks back up the way he came hearing the footsteps coming down after him
backs away a few paces on the slippery rocks
lands on the crumpled dead body of larry the bodyguard who was thrown off the cliff
when wilson appears valentine fires at him
a wild shot that only makes wilson duck momentarily
valentine scrambles to his feet runs on
jumps down from the steps
stops for a moment and leans his back against the railing
bends at the knees slightly
the handle is forced upward just enough to be reachable now
grimacing pulls the knife out and discards it
or tries to
its dark and the ground is treacherous
the beach runs out pretty soon
now just rocks
maybe he thought he could get around the rocks on the point at the other end
but he cant see very far ahead
and the tide is in water making any escape extremely difficult
he tries to scramble over some rocks
theyre wet slippery
he falls cries out as he literally breaks an ankle
a dark figure
coming into focus
walking inexorably this way
painfully rights himself
a small bone protrudes from his broken ankle
he fires at wilson gun in one hand other hand gripping his wrist to try and steady it
doing his best to aim
but the shots miss their mark
out of bullets now
gun clicking crazily on empty
he simply drops it
now stands before him
both breathing hard
this is not what valentine expected
closer tell me about jenny
closer about the deal whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it you bastard
wilson drops to the ground too in a passionate fury starts strangling valentine
tell me about it you fucking bastard
easing up just enough for valentine to sputter out a response
she couldve had the deal
i wouldve handed it to her if she wanted
i would have given her everything
why did you do it
theyre locked in a kind of embrace
sprayed by the waves crashing into the rocks
sweating and gasping and exhausted and hurt and furious
she didnt want to share it she wanted to stop it
to stop me
she said shed turn me in shock of recognition on his face
at those words
she said you go ahead with this ill turn you in terry
wilson sits back
the two of them
both on the ground now
whatever energy they had left drained valentine from his confession wilson from hearing it
valentine shaking sobbing
still not realizing the pathetic folly of his actions
she was serious
she would have done it
she had the phone in her hand
she was going to do it
knows that the girl he loved
loved valentine too
having heard the truth the last vestige of revenge has vanished
he gets up and walks away
leaving the quivering shell of valentine behind
adhara wakes up
hand to her smashed cheek and mouth
but its not her hand
she sort of shuffles away from him along the floor
sits against a wall holding her face
valentine sits back against an opposite wall
they stare at each other
wilson lost in thought
accepts a drink from a flight attendant
we can see it pains him to reach for it
after setting the glass down his other hand goes to the shoulder where his stab wound was no doubt only temporarily dealt with
at the roadside hotel grimacing
cleaning his wound
wilson rubs his shoulder
the american lady in the seat beside him heard the way he said thanks to the flight attendant
a small beat which he takes each time he responds
yeah thats right
i can never decide what i like better
leaving home or coming back
takes this in
shaving in the mirror at his l
in the car leaving valentines house
fingering the picture of jenny
i would have preferred staying home me
youre a reluctant traveller then
in the car with elaine and ed driving back from big sur
everyone in their own world
at eds house
wilson and ed
watching him get into elaines car
got called out to l
unexpected like to do a job of work
at the airport staring at elaine
wilson and elaine
she embraces him
she watches him leave
disappearing into the terminal
youll be looking forward to getting back then
another little matter needs attending to soon as i return
no rest for the wicked
wilson nods exhales
in the cab on the way to eds at the beginning of the film
watching the lights go by
been away a lot
he actually turns to look at her now
takes her in then looks forward again
out on a oil rig
in the north sea
laughs is that legal
well time off for good behavior you know
i shouldnt have even been there it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place
i got lumbered with the job they were responsible for
i dont mind pulling me own cart but not someone elses know what i mean
but you stuck it out anyway all that time
i had to didnt i
nothing else for it
then just when id finished my nine years my contract wallop i had to bugger off to the states
reacting slightly to his colorful language sounds like you need a rest
could do yeah
but first i gotta give these lads a talking to these geezers what sent me up the river in a manner of speaking
the ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders
and he turns away to the window
looks at the blue sky
sips his drink
then hard them next
