written by based on the book by may draft the saddest eyes you ever saw
we are looking at an el greco drawing
it is a study for one of his paintings
a bunch of art students are doing sketches of the eyes the elongated fingers the slender hands el greco drew so brilliantly
most of the students are around
a couple of suburban housewives are there too
and one older man
this is luther whitney
mid s very fit neatly dressed
at quick glance he seems as if he might be a successful company executive
as we watch him draw we can tell he is capable of great concentration
with eyes that miss nothing he has pilots eyes
well find out more about him as time goes on but this is all you really have to know luther whitney is the hero of this piece
as we watch him draw luthers sketchbook
he is finishing his work on the eyes and hes caught the sadness its good stuff
its not good enough for him
he looks at his work a moment shakes his head
dont give up
i never do
shes indicated his sketchbook
she starts thumbing through
the sketchbook as the pages turn
eyes and hands
the eyes are good
the hands are better
b absolute power rev
the girl hands it back
you work with your hands dont you
an enigmatic smile
now from that a nice working class part of town
nothing fancy here but theres a pleasant feel
the streets are clean the houses neat and well tended
luther carrying his sketchbook walks along
its afternoon now
up ahead is a local bar reds
luther walks in
nothing fancy here
strictly working class
and relatively empty
an overweight bald man luthers age works behind the bar
this is red
they are good enough friends not to ask each other questions
as they nod to each other redhead
as luther hands him a videotape your life would be a whole lot simpler if you could learn to operate a v
my only failing
as he turns a street of small row houses
clean well tended
luther walks toward one
later in the afternoon
he carries half a dozen small shopping bags from the market the hardware store the drug store the cleaners
a terra cotta planter to the right of the front door
luther shifts his packages tilts the planter slightly bends down pulls out a key inserts it in the front door
as he enters
a cuisinart a cheese slicer lots of other nice equipment
as he begins putting food away evening now
table set for one
a single candle
beside the candle is luthers sketch pad
now luther himself moves into view carrying a tray
he puts it down
a gorgeous omelet is on a fine china plate parsley sprinkled neatly on top
an elegant green salad is on another plate covered with thinly sliced parmesan cheese
an expensive water pitcher a lovely glass
clearly a great deal of thought has gone into dinner
luther lights the single candle
we are now aware of a photograph nearby
the picture is old
a pretty little girl stands in the center smiling
her mother stands alongside smiling too
a man is with them looking at them happily
when he was young
luther studies the photo a moment
then he turns looks out the window
now luther opens the sketch pad quickly flips past the hands and eyes and faces we are looking at something totally different a mansion
hold on luthers drawing of the mansion
pull back to reveal
in the moonlight it looks exactly like his drawing
but no drawing could convey the size of the place we are looking at ten thousand square feet
wealth and power
were in rolling hill country
the mansion is dark
now a sound tires on gravel
a car comes rolling into view
the motor of the car has been turned off
the lights of the car have been turned off
the car slides to a stop
hold on mansion a couple of hundred yards away
there is a small field between the car and the estate
now a man holds binoculars studying the place
he wears dark clothes tennis shoes
he puts down the binoculars begins to smear his face with black camouflage cream its luther and hes been a professional thief his entire life
hes a three time loser but his last sentence was so long ago and his skills are now so vast so refined that it is unlikely he will ever get
the grounds as luther glides through it
he wears a backpack
the night is cool
all that separates him from the mansion now is a stretch of gorgeous lawn
except for luther it isnt gorgeous its no mans land
one final check of his surroundings then he sets off in graceful motion long strides eating up the ground
he makes no sound at all
thick wood with reinforced steel
luther stops by the door takes off his backpack opens it
he puts on plastic gloves that have a special layer of padding at the fingertips and palms
now he takes a key inserts it in the front door turns it and the instant he pushes the door open zoom to
the infrared security detector it immediately starts to beep and you can see the seconds being counted down forty thirty nine thirty in his hands now is an automatic screwdriver
no more than six inches long he sets to work on the security panel that is inside in the foyer next to the front door
the screwdriver undoes the first screw the second thirty one thirty twenty now the third and fourth screws are in hands and he lifts the security panel away
the beeping sound is constant and getting louder
a tiny device no bigger than a pocket calculator
it has two wires protruding from it
it is we are about to find out a tiny computer
luther holds it like a baby
eighteen seventeen probing with the wires into the heart of the security panel
the beeping is louder still
the security panel
luther is attempting delicate work and its dark so it isnt easy but he continues to probe with the wires and eleven ten and hes got it attached
now the face of the tiny computer is alive with numbers they fly by much too fast for us to make them out clearly
four three two as five numbers lock the beeping sound dies
a glance across the foyer the lights of the security detector go from red to a warm looking green
he allows himself to exhale
then hes busy again unhooking the computer
his fingers as always work quickly precisely
the foyer as luther once again carrying his backpack moves across it
behind him the front door is again shut the security panel back on screws all in place
its as if he hadnt been there at all
luther walks quickly up and here we get a sense of the vast size of the place it feels bigger inside than it looked in the moonlight
a van gogh at the head of the stairs
luther moves past it then stops goes back studies the painting
its a late one when the madness had him and things were sliding away
luther looks at it admiringly for another moment then surprisingly he raises his hand and for just an instant traces the lines of the painting in the air as if
trying to figure out how the magic was done as if getting ready for his next museum session then almost grudgingly he moves on up toward the third floor
heres a hopper
one of the great ones filled with an overpowering sense of being alone luther stares at it almost in awe whispers wow moves on
luther walking down the third floor corridor
the corridor walls
no paintings here instead we see a series of framed photographs
the first is of a baby girl the next one of the same child at three
we watch the child grow up in these photos
at ten she is already pretty
at fifteen a stunner
b absolute power rev
not a classic beauty by any means she is turning into if you will a latter day ann margret
the kind of girl you ached for in high school
the perfect cheerleader
these are pictures we will come to know of christy sullivan
a high school graduation shot at eighteen a shot in front of a burger king at twenty
christy looking just fabulous is and smiling happily
we can only see her face and the wedding veil here
now pull back to reveal a glorious and expensive white wedding dress
christy holds a bouquet of flowers
and now we can see the groom
walter is smiling too one arm proudly around his lovely bride
walter it might be noted is eighty years old
luther staring at the photo shakes his head
now he moves on
luther opens the door
he goes inside closes the door firmly
next he puts his backpack down takes out a low power non glare work light sets it up
now he looks around
a huge room a gigantic canopied bed
a nightstand alongside which contains a small silver clock three danielle steel novels piled neatly one atop the other several more photos of the happy couple and an antique silver
plated letter opener with a thick leather handle
he studies himself in front of a very large full length mirror across from the canopied bed
now we realize something he isnt studying himself hes studying the mirror itself
he turns goes to the sitting area where there are chairs and a sofa and a large tv and vcr
three remotes on a side table
luther carefully picks up the middle one crosses the room with it points it at the large mirror clicks once and the mirror swings silently open
a room is revealed
all we can see of it so far is this there is an armchair in the middle facing where the mirror had been
luther turns back toward the sitting area the remote held in his hand
the side table
luther puts the remote down very carefully
in the exact position it had been
now he takes a moment blows on his hands rubs them together
then luther takes a collapsible duffel bag out of his backpack moves with the work light into the revealed room its a vault
and its full
theres cash naturally piles of the stuff
plus all kinds of other valuables well get around to
luthers a little stunned its more than he hoped for
he glances at the armchair there is a remote on it that is identical to the one he replaced at the side table
now he opens his duffel all the way and sets to work
first the cash goes in all neatly bundled
lots of bundles
next are a series of slender boxes the first box as luther opens it
into the duffel it goes
luther emptying more jewelry boxes into the duffel
and still more
as he continues to do this all is quiet
high on a wall the security light beams a friendly green
now from somewhere a distant sound
was it laughter
doesnt matter its gone
b absolute power rev
luther has moved deeper into it hes finished with the jewelry
now hes examining piles of bonds
into the duffel they go
he takes a breath glances around
they disappear into the duffel
gone into the swelling duffel
luther as he hears now the distant laughter
not so perfect
he moves quickly out of the vault takes a step toward the door the giggling is getting louder closer
a man and a woman
luther stops mutters shit
glances around no place to hide
luther grabbing his backpack moves into the vault turns off his work light and shuts the door with the remote
the door clicks luther is alone in the darkness
a burst of laughter now
growing nearer still
luther moves into the back of the vault crouches down doing his best to hide behind the armchair
trapped luther waits in silence trying not to breathe
now he can hear a squeak the bedroom door has opened
dark except for a slant of light from the hall outside the open bedroom door
two people are briefly visible as they enter a man and a woman
the clink of glass
the woman closes the bedroom door
and now the laughing sound increases
luther in the pitch black vault
the giggling is muted but it is there
he is starting to perspire
the woman flicks on the lights and as she does luther as the burst of light hits him like a fist and its over
luther blinks confused looks around because it isnt over he hasnt been caught
the door to the vault is suddenly gone
luther is staring straight into the goddamn bedroom
because the door is a two way mirror
now its as if he was watching the bedroom on a giant tv screen
just a few feet away just outside the door
where things are clearly starting to heat up
luther moves to the armchair sits
there is nothing to do now but wait
he settles in
they are staring at each other
we have seen the woman already shes christy sullivan
but the pictures in the corridor did not do her justice
this is a fabulous looking twenty five year old woman
long golden hair a round face that sets off her deep blue eyes a tanned curving body
a bare shouldered black dress
an expensive necklace
one more thing she is staggering drunk
the man is alan richmond wealthy successful handsome and fit
he wears an elegantly cut suit
two additional points richmond is clearly not the husband in the wedding photo
he is drunker than she is
richmond carries a vodka bottle and two tumblers
he fills them gives one to her
they touch glasses
down the hatch
he looks at her
she looks at him
theres a lot of sexual tension in the air
but now he begins looking around checking things out
she spots this
drunk its okay i told him i was sick anyway hes gone relax
he nods then more at ease
and he blows her a kiss
she catches it and now she starts to parade for him
her body moving very slowly
he pours himself another shot chugs it watches
now luther suddenly terrified and we find out why
christy fumbling with her necklace looks across the room what shes looking at the side table with the remote that opens the vault
luther frozen as christy starts toward the table
the table and the remote waiting there
luther mouth dry
b absolute power rev
richmond reaching out for her then as she passes him he takes her by the hand and now they are dancing their bodies pressed together
they move slowly
he tries to get fancy spin her with one arm no good
theyre too drunk for it starts to lose balance separate
smile at each other
now christy manages to unhook her necklace and as she starts to drop it in the drawer of the nightstand luther
a genuine sigh of relief which suddenly dies christy as she spins toward the table again still with the necklace in her hand
luther and theres nothing he can do now but watch
richmond watching too emptying the vodka bottle into his tumbler chugging it down and now
the table as christy reaches out grabs a remote turns
luther dead in the water because pointing the goddam thing at him and as she clicks it b absolute power rev
luther and for a moment hes like a goddam deer caught in the headlights but now here comes another sigh of relief and we find out why
suddenly theres romantic music playing shes turned the stereo on
christy starts humming replaces the clicker drops the necklace in the drawer
then they are into each others arms
their bodies press
their bodies sway
he moves a hand to her breasts christy breaks loose shakes a finger at him as if to say naughty naughty then with one hand she pulls a zipper down
the dress falls off her body
her breasts spring free
she is wearing only her panties now and high heels
and a smile
she is stunning looking and she knows it and men have always gone nuts over her and she knows that too
and richmond cant resist her either goes to her bends her back caresses her neck begins sucking her nipples
luther in the chair embarrassed averting his eyes
but the moaning from the other room grows louder more insistent
christy pulling away for a moment starting to work at richmonds tie shakes him out of his suit jacket reaches for his belt loosens it
she is working at his shirt buttons now and their breathing is audible and in a moment he is down to his boxer shorts and then her panties are off
her shoes kicked away and they are near the vault mirror now
as they approach it they stare at themselves
luther moving farther back in his chair as their faces are just a couple of feet away b absolute power rev
as richmonds hands move across her wondrous body and she is hot and drifting into drunken fantasy and her eyes close and as his eyes are open the look on
his drunken face is scary
luther transfixed by that look transfixed and worried
looking at each other now and she is smiling happily and looking at him and he is smiling happily and looking at her and whatever was on his face just
before has gone
luther watching as they turn for the gigantic canopied bed
the bed as they stop alongside it and kiss its their first
and her arms go around his neck and she holds him like that her eyes shut tight luther watching because richmonds eyes are not shut they are wide open and
they stare at the mirror and the awful look from before is back only worse and then without warning he grips her buttocks roughly and slaps her hard on the ass over and over and christy is shocked surprised pulls away
richmond smiles at her sweetly
shaking her head
he continues to smile makes a courtly gesture kissing her fingertips in apology
she smiles in acknowledgement and they move onto the bed
she pushes him down and straddles him
richmond from her point of view a wonderfully handsome man
christy from his point of view
a glorious vibrant young woman
she smiles touches her lips to a finger reaches out touches the finger to his mouth
its a sweet moment
then he reaches up and without a word grabs her breasts and squeezes and twists them brutally and christy is shocked and she tries to make him stop but he
wont and she cries out in pain but he still wont stop so she slaps him in the face
he slaps her back viciously right in the mouth and now there is blood mixing with her lipstick and she rolls off the bed onto the floor
christy sits there stunned
slurred you fucking bastard
and on that richmond standing now reaches down to help her up
christy hesitates finally takes his hand and as soon as she is on her feet christy kicking him with all she has in the stomach
luther silently applauding
richmond the air momentarily out of him falling drunkenly to the floor stunned for just a moment and clearly in pain but he is a big man and he is
strong and he grabs her ankle yanks and then both are laboring on the floor and christy kicks him again and again but he will not release her ankle
each kick only inflames his drunken rage
very slurred you little whore and now they both try and stand
neither one does it gracefully neither one does it quickly but richmond gets there first and as soon as he is on his feet he begins to strangle her
christy gasping terrified she claws at his arms her fingers scratching deeply but he will not let go
she twists and jerks her body no good he continues to tighten his grip on her throat and spreads his legs for better balance
the bed table as christy beyond desperation reaches around for something anything her fingers finally close on the letter opener and in one wild stroke she slashes his right arm
now he lets go
and stares stunned at his bleeding arm
then he crunches her flush in the mouth a brutal blow and blood pours from her nose and mouth and if she werent so scared maybe it would have stopped
her but it doesnt because somehow she manages to maintain balance and knees him all she has in the nuts
its over richmond falls to the floor helpless
he lies on his back holding his crotch
but it isnt over
christy blood pouring down her face stands over him the letter opener still tight in her hand
and in her eyes you can see it the homicidal rage and she drops to her knees beside him and richmond can only lie there watching her and she gets
a better grip on the letter opener and richmond still only lies there watching her
and she raises the letter opener slowly very high above her head the point aimed at his heart and richmond screams one time and as christy starts to kill him
two well dressed men in business suits burst through the bedroom doorway guns in their hands and they blow her brains out before the opener reaches richmonds heart
luther in slow motion and this is what he does he reels back in the chair eyes wide jaw slack mouth open this is a man who has seen everything
but nothing has prepared him for this his arms flop over the arms of the chair his body loses strength he tries to look away cant and this is what he sees christy fighting for another instant of life no chance the two bullets have shattered her brain her eyes roll up into her head the letter opener drops to the rug she collapses like a rag doll and blood is everywhere
back in regular motion now
pale barely able to breathe
the two well dressed men in business suits
bill burton is the more formidable
mid s he looks like a retired tight end
no body fat
but right now he is shaking and he cant stop it
he puts his gun away goes to richmond
tim collin is closing in on
in wonderful shape
burton is more physical collin more lethal
he puts his gun away goes to christy
richmond is trying to sit
he is as drunk as before but now he is also close to shock
he reaches over manages to pick up the bloody letter opener
collin by the body nods
no choice in the matter
his words are efficient but clearly he has been rocked
richmond staring stupidly at the letter opener
he drops it back to the floor tries to stand cant
burton helps him back to the bed
which is when he passes out cold
burton and collin look at each other now
jesus tim what did we do
echoing burton no choice in the matter
luther staring at it all
the shock is still there but so is something new anger
and on that gloria russell moving through the bedroom door
russells well dressed attractive and very smart
now she sees whats happened stops dead
now she moves forward looks at burton and collin
its very clear from the outset these three are not friendly
b absolute power rev
to burton and collin do you realize what a shitstorm were in
beat go on tell me
nothing to tell
and you heard no sounds of violence til then
beat nothing we havent heard before
richmond on the bed out
russell studies his face as burton moves toward the telephone
maybe i should call the police now
why dont you think about that
beat starting to move toward him take a second and just think about that
closing in on burton furious think
he is strong enough to snap her neck with one hand
backing away probably not a good idea
taking charge okay heres what happened tonight poor christy came home alone and interrupted a burglary
that sound logical
luther in the closet
burton and collin nod too
were going to have to sanitize this place
shaking richmond alan did you have sex with her
richmond eyes barely open
bill youre going to have to examine her
im no gynecologist
she takes nothing from nobody i just made you one
end of discussion
a clock on the side table beside the three clickers
there is the sound of a vacuum its later now
the place is incredibly changed
christy is lying as before except now she is fully dressed
the bed has been made with clean sheets
there is a large black garbage bag that collin shoves the sheets in dumps in christys jewelry
burton is vacuuming the rug
richmond is visible still in terrible shape finishing putting his clothes on in the open master bedroom
everyone wears gloves
everything that is incriminating is gone
except the letter opener which has been put in a clear plastic bag
collin reaches for it starts to dump it in along with the sheets and the jewelry
ill take that
surprised its got their prints on it
she holds out her hand thanks for sharing
collin glances at burton shrugs hands it over
russell puts it in her handbag puts the handbag on the bed table when suddenly richmond careening into the room wide eyed crying out gloria i killed her russell turning
shocked as richmond bears down she holds out her arms for him but he is staggering and he collides hard with her spins against the wall uses the bed table to try to steady himself
luther stunned staring
what hes staring at the letter opener has spilled from her open purse and fallen behind the bed out of sight
russell calm going to richmond starting to lead him from the room its all going to be fine alan
but shes dead
ill take care of everything just like i always do
to burton and collin gentlemen
she gestures to leave
burton and collin finish up collin grabs the large plastic bag
burton glances around one final time and backs toward the door vacuuming carefully
then collin stops dead
he stares across at the bed table
luther holding his breath
in reply collin dashes back toward the bed table grabs russells purse snaps it shut tucks it under one arm and leaves
burton flicks the light out closes the door
the room is lit by moonlight now
christy looks beautiful and still
hold for a moment
its open and russell leads a staggering richmond outside
two dark towncars are parked in the driveway
burton is behind them turning off all lights
collin is last with russells purse the garbage bag
as he follows them outside he closes the front door firmly it makes a loud solid sound
the sound is barely audible
he has been looking at his watch
the watch face is illuminated in the darkness
the second hand is fifteen seconds away from the top
luther takes a deep breath waits in silence
the watch face the sound is loud like minutes
burton and russell moving with richmond toward one of the cars
burton takes the man in his arms leaving russell free to open the back door
collin dumps the plastic bag into the trunk shuts it moves quickly so that he can get a decent view of the road
the road in front of the house
collin hurries to the towncar where burton is struggling to get richmond comfortably stretched out on the back seat
the second hand on luthers watch hits the top and he moves into action
he points the clicker at the door the door starts to swing open luther backpack in hand strides quickly into the bedroom turns points the clicker again and as the
door starts to swing shut luther carefully tosses the clicker back inside
as the clicker lands dead solid perfect luther in the bedroom moving to the nightstand carrying his backpack he slows as he circles the body of christy sullivan looks sadly
down at her continues on as we move to
b absolute power rev
the bed table
first luther opens the drawer and pockets the necklace
tense he kneels probes behind the table reaches farther and then the letter opener
in the plastic bag
luther grabs it
he rises opener in hand and goes to the far window that has a view of the front of the house
he looks out grimaces
the cars are still there
burton is visible helping russell in
collin hands over her purse closes the door
he and burton move to the front doors
luther going to the rear window
he opens the window slowly and silently
he ties one end of the rope around the leg of a heavy wooden chest of drawers now he carefully plays the knotted rope out the window
collin heads to one of the towncars
in the other burton and russell are getting settled in the front
richmond lies in a stupor stretched along the rear seat
russell a moment of relief
she breathes deep
and as russell starts to open her purse as it snakes down the brick mansion it reaches the ground
luther putting his backpack on securely
the window luther glances out and down
forty feet below
and its dark
b absolute power rev
luther he doesnt much like this but taking hold of the rope he puts one leg out the window only the damn backpack makes it complicated and hes caught for
a moment clumsily trapped with one leg in one leg out and the backpack wedged against the corner of the window and at that moment there is a scream
gloria russell as every nightmare she has ever had comes true the fucking letter opener isnt in her purse and as she screams again luther cursing to himself forcing his
way out the window and it isnt easy but he makes it and then the rope slips in his hands and for one precarious moment he is in serious trouble and
the towncar doors bursting open as burton and collin come barrelling out
luther getting his grip on the nylon rope again starting to go down but its difficult going for him
burton and collin tearing into the house collin in the lead
luther in the night thirty feet up and he can hear commotion inside the house and he tries to go faster but its not easy the man is after all
in his s and hes dangerously high and his visibility is rotten so hes doing the best he can but he isnt exactly flying
russell standing by the towncar staring in at the house and from the look on her face you know she thinks her life might be over
burton and collin racing up the second floor staircase toward the top
luther halfway down
burton and collin tearing along the third floor corridor
luther ten feet off the ground now
the bedroom door flying open
luther six feet to go three and he lets go drops the rest of the way hits the ground running
burton racing toward the window collin goes to the night table
luther at the end of the house turning a corner
burton staring out the window and luther is gone
b absolute power rev
collin looking around the table and the letter opener is gone
and without another word they bolt out the door
luther crashing through the field
he is in wonderful shape for a man his age
and he gives it all he has but is it going to be enough
the towncar as collin yanks something out of the glove compartment and then he is racing off into the night after burton who is a few steps ahead
russell staring after them in the back seat richmond is in a half slumber
luther bursting out of the underbrush up ahead is the most dangerous place for him one hundred yards of open field
he runs on
as collin catches up to the other man tosses what he took from the glove compartment
they put them on on the fly and
the world ahead of them as they see it their field of vision now resembles a rough computer game
thermal images register in red everything else is dark green
beginning to tire now and hes only halfway through the open field and
burton and collin behind him cant see him yet but they are moving faster and burton could probably destroy anyone in a fight but collin can fly
and he begins to leave burton behind
luther and twenty yards ahead of him are some woods that spur him on he pumps his arms his body straining and his breath coming in gasps and
collin graceful and young and in fabulous shape and just ahead is the open field and as he starts into it what collin sees a thermal figure a man running
out of the open and then disappearing into the woods
the sight of the figure is enough to kick collin into overdrive and he has never run this fast as he crosses the open area
luther running through the woods he can hear them now and he knows theyre closing on him and he glances back and smashes into a fucking tree
and it rocks him drops him to his knees collin and he could be jet propelled
luther forcing himself back to his feet and running again giving it everything he has left and hes dodging through the trees now
burton behind collin but he draws his gun anyway collin in the woods and his guns drawn too luther out of the woods and now his car is visible collin
in the woods but theyre coming to an end
the figure up ahead is approaching a car
luther throwing the car door open ripping off his backpack tossing it inside jumping in behind the wheel
pulling up gasping terribly
he sinks to one knee
collin out of the woods
still amazingly without the least sign of tiring and now there is a sound a car motor starting
luther in his car wheels spinning
collin has his pistol ready but its impossible to hit anything when youre running like this
luther in the car gunning away
a swirl of dust
the dust clears
the car rounds a corner is gone
he stands there rips off his thermal goggles and surprisingly he smiles
burton getting to his feet his breath still not steady
he takes his goggles off too as collin approaches
still the smile i got his license number
now on that russell back in the bedroom with burton and collin who are moving around constantly checking the place out
things are just amazingly tense
close to losing it gee guys maybe it was the bogeyman dont forget to check under the bed exploding you may have buried us
relax i got his license number remember
whirling on him you think hes going to just sit around waiting for us
asshole take it easy miss russell
trying for calm everybody shut up all right
he is staring at his reflection in the big mirror
he crosses to it goes to his knees studies the rug
the rug indentations in the expensive carpet
burton and collin with a crowbar working at the mirror
the mirror there is a tear and a pop and it swings open
all three going inside looking around
the chair the looted shelves
the truth thuds home
russell turns looks out at the bedroom through the door
dead a two way mirror
silently they move out into the bedroom
i better get cracking on that license number no anger now its all weve got and hes got the letter opener blood fingerprints jesus think what he can do a
powerful man who speaks softly the man is a thief a thief who witnessed a murder
gesturing around it looks like he stole a whole bunch of money ill tell you what hes going to do
beat hes going to run like hell
and on that the saddest eyes you ever saw
its the next morning and luther is back at the same old stand looking at el greco
the other art students are there too
so are the suburban housewives
everything is as it was calm and peaceful now a museum guard moves into the doorway scanning the room
luther a quick glance over then back to his sketchbook and from that glance its clear all is not calm and peaceful
the guard checks the room again
edgy luther still works away
the guard leaves
luther gets set to do the same
red alone in his empty bar sipping coffee
its before the place has opened for the day
luther comes in the back
red slides the videocassette over luther pockets it
jordan beat us at the buzzer
and as he turns goes
a young woman parking her car a high rocky area above the potomac
below a jogging path is visible full of runners
the young woman gets out locks her car starts down a narrow walk toward the joggers
shes in her mid thirties
a good face
and theres something familiar about her
luther standing by the edge of the jogging path studying the runners
now he registers something and smiles
the woman in her mid thirties as she comes jogging along
she runs well
an imperceptible straightening of his clothes
we realize who she is the little girl in the photo on luthers dining room table
all grown up
now her face registers something his presence
her eyes go down to the path she increases her speed
waving calling out
as she runs on kate
she slows hesitates stops
kate hands on hips breathing deeply moving to the edge of the path as he approaches
the river flows behind them
runners pass by
probably too late for me to take it up
she says nothing he gestures toward the path
dumb way to start this i guess
wanted to talk to you
believe it or not the weather
as she waits nights are starting to get cold
that happens this time of year
luther speaks quickly now his voice low
i was thinking of maybe relocating
someplace with a kinder climate
nothing shows on her face i just wanted to check it out with you first
still nothing youre the only family ive got
and on that kate speaks quickly now her voice low
luther you dont have me
the last words in this world he wanted to hear but you cant tell from his face
kate you know what its like being the only kid in show and tell who got to talk about visiting day
this move im talking permanent you understand
we dont see each other anyway we havent seen each other since mom died and thats a year
a step toward him look you chose your life
you had that right
you were never around for me
but i have no plans to be around for you
and now she stops turns away toward the path luther can say nothing watches her then she spins back louder now wait a minute youre lying about something arent you
no are you active again
is that why youre here now
no kate moves in close now i dont believe you big christ father what have you done
and on those words christy sullivans body
were back in the master bedroom but now there is a lot of police activity people work around the corpse
the place is covered with black fingerprint powder
b absolute power rev
seth frank moves into the room bogart at
chief homicide detective of middleton county virginia but he had a decade of top work in new york city
bright funny and tough enough for anything you want to throw at him
he kneels beside the body next to an older man
this is the medical examiner fat and bored
seth studies christy sadly shakes his head
nods wife of walter most likely came home and stumbled onto a burglary some burglary
laura is early s and the best lab technician seth has ever known and he knew some good ones in new york
i wish my carpets were this clean
and i cant find a single decent fingerprint
you serious laura
bewildered its like mary poppins was here
could someone have let him in
sorry seth but the entire sullivan household went to barbados two days ago
thank you for your support
wait it gets worse moving to the door the shots came from here
if she interrupted a burglary she should have been here moving to the bed now she was killed where she is all the blood patterns indicate that
but she was looking toward the bed what in hell was she looking at
seth says nothing as he and laura go in the vault
seth stares at the chair
looks like someone sat here but i couldnt find any prints
lowering her voice indicating the one way mirror you think sullivan holed up in the chair and watched his wife perform
i hope not shakes his head hes such a great man
he moves back into the bedroom
another cop is working on the wall by the bed table where a hole the size and shape of a bullet is visible
as he moves past careful digging that out
the cop nods
looks like he tried to strangle her
so he tried to strangle her then went to the door and shot her from behind
he also inspected her vagina
he did what
maybe he couldnt remember if he fucked her
has to laugh a strong burglar with a weak mind obviously another open and shut case
as he stares around baffled
a high rise
its in a different part of washington than weve seen thus far
an old salesman type is trudging into the building
hes slumped carries heavy salesman type suitcases
he wears a battered hat
as he goes inside the salesman is opening a mail slot with the name hawthorne on the outside
a good bit of mail most of it unsolicited
hawthorne pockets it unlocks the foyer heads toward the elevator
the elevator and hawthorne slowly getting out heading toward a corner apartment taking out some keys there are three locks on the door
he takes out keys
hawthorne walks in puts the suitcases down flings his hat toward a long sofa its luther and this we will come to learn is what he keeps as his safe
its neatly furnished modern and clean
now he moves quickly first he opens a suitcase it contains his full backpack from the robbery then he opens a locked closet door revealing a very large and sophisticated
as he begins to work the dial the tv on in the living room as he slides the video cassette red gave him into his machine
everything has been put away
the tv as michael jordan is introduced to the crowd luther sits nurses a beer watches intently
an old man silently weeping
this is walter sullivan one of the giants of the era
a self made billionaire
remarkably the man has few enemies
at his body may be betraying him he was once handsome but his mind is that of a young man
weve seen him before in the wedding picture on the wall of his mansion
with his young bride christy
he is with her again now at the morgue
a sheet covers her body
the toe tag is visible
walter shattered and desolate stares at her once joyous face
pull back to reveal seth frank studying walter through a two way mirror
seth is moved at depth of the old mans grief
anyone would be
walter slowly rises
sandy lord waiting in an anteroom as walter enters
sandy lord is walter sullivans lawyer
he is abrasive powerful
sandy moves to walter gestures toward the front door
seth appears through another door intercepts them
im seth frank senior homicide detective for middleton county protectively my client is in no mood for conversation sir
its all right sandy looks at seth youre in charge of the case
nods i have to ask some questions but it can be tomorrow
you want what positive identification
yes that was my wife
notebook in hand youd been in barbados for two days
nods i took the entire staff down always do this time of year
sullivan didnt come
she was had it all planned but you know women they change their minds
to seth softly id been married to my rebecca for forty seven years and when she died i decided i never wanted that pain again
one thing i knew about christy she was going to outlive me
i think thats enough for today
takes walters arm
beat i have to ask about the vault
and on that walter
holds to sandy for a moment then lets go
you mean the contents of the vault of course turns to sandy sandy you go on im all right
as sandy looks at him a moment really
go to the reception obviously i cant make it but im sure everyone will understand
sandy nods exits
seth and walter are alone
then i know its not the contents as seth embarrassed stands there you mean the chair
you have to ask about the chair
soft yessir i do
are they connected
b absolute power rev
i think someone sat in it and i think that someone may have been involved in the murder
beat you were my fathers hero mr
sullivan i promise you this wont make my highlight reel
id hoped i could satisfy her
but you know
she had needs and she didnt want to go behind my back
she suggested the chair
she hoped i might get to like sitting there
beat i didnt
takes a breath ive tried for eighty years to live a decent life
ive given a billion dollars to charity
if this comes to trial none of that will be remembered ill just go out as the joke of the world
he closes his notebook
i understand sir ill do what i can
beat will you listen to me whine
please forgive me mr
just do your job
beat and ill do mine
walter slowly moves to the door
seth watches him
a gorgeous shot of a very famous place
the sun is setting
it all looks magical
a room filled with well dressed men and women
the rich and the famous
but the only one we recognize is sandy lord deep in conversation with several other men
now someone says his name
as sandy turns is there anything i can do
and on those words the th president of the united states
he has all the natural charm in the world
he is remarkably bright with a phenomenal memory
he is also at this moment one of the most popular men in american history three years into a brilliant first term a shoo in for re election when that
his name by the way is alan richmond and weve seen him before most recently lying drunk in the back seat of a dark towncar
take a walk with me
he and sandy start out of the room
a well dressed woman moves with them
she is chief of staff and her name is two men in suits follow behind
burton and collin are their names and they are the best the secret service has to offer
the group as they leave the room come to a wide corridor
tell me about walter how is he
eighty and alone mr
he understands officially my hands are tied
president hes touched at your concern
b absolute power rev
any news of the killer
as sandy indicates no well why isnt there
whos in charge of the case
top man eight years homicide work in new york
but i understand how you feel its hard to be patient
terribly upset no one understands how i feel im supposed to have all this power but i cant help my oldest friend you know and i know that more than
any man alive walter sullivan put me here and now when he most needs me he must feel abandoned
on fire ill hold a press conference and ill have walter come and i will embrace him before the world
hell treasure that mr
what a generous gesture
and he reaches out shakes richmonds hand squeezes richmonds arm and richmond suddenly screaming in pain sandy pulls back shocked
richmond looks embarrassed
quick smile damn tennis elbow is killing me
and on that
richmond immediately after and he sure isnt smiling now he storms toward the oval office russell burton and collin hurrying to keep up
burton opens the door for them closes it once theyre inside
throws off his jacket turns on russell this things worse gloria
i need to see a doctor
the country would have to be informed mr
what happened to my right to privacy
rolls up his sleeve studies his cut i think she nicked a tendon
burton says its a flesh wound to burton when did you become such an expert bill
ever been wounded
quietly yes sir
richmond goes to it rubs his arm stares at the flames
are you serious about that press conference alan
of course i am walters been like a father to me
shall i bring mrs
richmond home for it
richmond turning from the fire now quietly
i think mrs
richmonds mission to help the poor in asia should not be interrupted
takes a breath starts to button his shirt we know anything yet
we checked his license plate he stole the car from a police impoundment lot
were not dealing with a fool here
gestures toward his jacket as russell helps him into it has he initiated contact
burton doesnt think he will
checking himself in a mirror sorry about my behavior wont happen again think of it as a blip on the screen
and as far as im concerned so is he
he could be a little more than that alan he saw
he saw nothing a drunk woman who liked rough sex too much
and hes a burglar
whos going to believe him
beat after all its not as if he had evidence or anything
and on those words b absolute power rev
luther holds it
its the middle of the night
luther turns the weapon over and over in his big hands
burton is alone in his car exiting the gate and driving home
he turns onto the main road
he picks up speed
glances around no cars are following
burton reaches into his pocket takes out a micro cassette recorder flicks it on
what happened to my right to privacy
beat i think she nicked a tendon
burton clicks the cassette off puts it back into his pocket
drives into the night
a stove with one burner on high
a tea kettle is over the flame
it is morning and kate is clearly not fully awake
she is finishing making instant coffee with lowfat milk and sweet n low next she goes to the front door of her apartment opens it picks up the morning washington
she unfolds the paper as she starts back to the kitchen huge headlines as big as you can get without a war
kate looks at it only a moment shakes her head then starts to turn her attention to another section of the paper she doesnt get that far
kate she has seen something she didnt catch before the front page again
and the headline is still there but there is a smaller headline beneath it jewel thief sought kate sits down hard
trying for control
entering a nightmare
she stares at the paper
the front page
pictures of the mansion of walter smiling on his wedding day of christy
but kates eyes keep coming back to the smaller headline jewel thief sought she tries to sip coffee spills
she closes her eyes in the kitchen the pot of water starts to shriek
kate does not move
kids riding bicycles
very norman rockwell
a bald man
there is the sound of a click
we realize after a moment that the bald man is luther
another shot of luther looking very different full beard
again a click
luther again elegant beard this time
pull back to reveal we are in the basement game room of one of the suburban homes
but our attention is on a whole string of polaroids of luther
two people are present luther and valerie
valerie is very small and doesnt miss much
she has been photographing him and as the last photo slides out of the camera she blows on it puts it alongside the others
as they study the pictures you always did disappear good luther
you mean ive got a weak face
youre lucky is all some of my customers they stand out no matter what
an order form book
valerie licks a pencil with her tongue
how many passports you need
thinks four should cover it
writes this down now youll want different looks and matching international drivers licenses ill throw in some dummy credit cards seeing its you
how the rugs i made you holding up
beards and mustaches too
pleased i try to give value for money
leaving the country permanent
it may come to that
b absolute power rev
matter where youve been
i hate doing those goddam asian passport stamps
maybe the caribbean for winters
when can i pick up
usually takes some time but for you ill rush it
ive always been able to count on you
valerie puts the order book down studies him
i dont want to know what youre into but leaving forever
i never figured you for a runner thirty percent of my runners kill themselves within five years
kisses her forehead five years doesnt sound so bad to me just now
and as he heads out seth and laura in the good sized criminal lab
loaded with up to date equipment
seth has drawn a picture of the crime scene
words like bedroom door exit window vault bed victim are written neatly to scale
he holds a sheaf of papers
b absolute power rev
its late afternoon and things are already getting crazed
noise in the b
see if any of this makes sense
seth mimes opening the bedroom door stepping inside closing it
he makes a click with his tongue
i am christy sullivan and i walk in and surprise a burglar
seth moves to the vault door mimes closing that makes a grunt
now youre the burglar coming out of the vault and being surprised
aims his finger like a pistol i draw my gun cutting in then why do you bother to strangle her when you could just shoot
thats nothing why do i bother to have her strip and then put her clothes back on
there i can help you see before you were a burglar you were a dry cleaner and you still love beautiful clothes
and i dress her because
she was a good customer and you didnt want her embarrassed when the police came
b absolute power rev
she had a point blood alcohol level
she was too drunk to drive
ive checked every cab and limo company in the area and not one of them knows anything
someone drove her home
and why havent they come forward
maybe whoever drove her home killed her
you saying the burglar drove her home
pissed i hate this case
an open door behind them
a telephone repairman appears
nice looking kid with a dazzling smile
sorry to bother you as seth turns ive got your phone working again shouldnt give you any more trouble
good service thanks
dazzling smile as he goes part of the job
seth and laura
seths lost his train of thought
then oh yeah remember that bullet hole in the wall
had the lab dig out the slug guess what no slug why does the burglar take the time to do that
different from the one in her body
b absolute power rev
getting more and more upset oh i like that a lot two different guns means two different burglars
two guys broke in
and they both went out the window
big and oh by the way why does he or they go out the window in the first place when he or they got in by breaking a zillion dollar
in doorway a bill burton of the secret service in the parking lot
gives papers to laura here you solve the goddam thing
as he starts away did i mention that i hate this case
i really truly hate this case you cannot imagine how much i hate it burton waits by his car as seth walks up
as they shake bill burton hi hi seth frank i know you must be going crazy but the boss is very interested in your progress
maybe we can help each other
what did you have in mind
you know how close he and sullivan are
as seth nods the minute anything breaks if youd call me id tell the president
that way hed be the first to alert mr
sullivan it would mean a lot to him
and any red tape you want cut done
as he takes out card here are my numbers
he turns opens his front car door
getting in leads
still trying to figure out what might have happened i loved playing sherlock holmes
surprised you secret service guys do that
i was state trooper here ten years ago before the government got me
it just pops out
youre that bill burton
i was younger and dumber then
quickly keep in touch
seth waves as burton drives away
b absolute power rev
he drives alertly along turns a corner
up ahead a telephone repair truck has stopped
the repairman leans out
he has a dazzling smile
he and burton wave to each other
two men are finishing dinner
walter sullivan we know
michael mccarty his dinner companion is fit handsome beautifully dressed
he is at present torn by a silver tray of small french pastries
noting mccartys temptation the chef makes them especially for me i promise you theyre sinful
mccarty grabs one downs it grins sheepishly
mccarty youre a salesman mr
sullivan nods as they rise
tastefully appointed as one would expect
this is a new arena for me but from what im told you have a flawless reputation mister mccarty which is why i need to employ you
i have no idea who im after
until i do you will have to wait in washington for instructions
b absolute power rev
mccarty out of the question im afraid
explaining as they walk mine isnt particularly creative work i only do it because i enjoy living beyond my means
i cant afford to just sit around
walter gestures for them to sit
when i was my father died he was a miner and lung disease killed him
i became rich at and the first thing i did was purchase that mine close it and give every miner there fifty thousand dollars to retire on
beat staring at mccarty now you will come to washington mr
you will put one million dollars expenses into the swiss bank account of your choosing
beat and when the time comes two million dollars a bullet
mccarty smiles nods you are a salesman sir
selling sin is easy
pull back to reveal
seth and laura in his office
the mug shot is on his desk along with some folders
seth beckons to her
studying photo who is he
luther whitney beat one of the great thieves of the world
the words pour out
been going nuts with this thing up all night and i remembered your notion how it might be two burglars and around dawn i thought wait what if it wasnt
two burglars but what if it was one guy trying to throw us off by making it look like two
faster called a buddy at the bureau they keep track of this stuff internationally he says maybe only a half a dozen guys alive could have pulled off the sullivan
job im tracing all six beat but whitneys the only one lives in washington
looking at seth now
starting to get excited too
why havent i ever heard of him
because he hasnt been arrested in thirty years
indicating mug shot this his graduation picture from harvard
waving her off ancient history he wasnt a jewel thief back then
just a kid just part of a gang a three time loser
but since he got out the last time hes only worked alone b absolute power rev
beat and no ones touched him
shakes his head he gets questioned whenever anything big comes up
but nothing sticks
really excited now seth we can make this stick ill bet you anything this is our guy a local
cant ask for more makes a face weve got a problem
whitney hasnt killed anyone in years
laura doesnt get it
big deal so hes a veteran
not just a veteran a wounded veteran
indicating folder got his combat record here
battles commendations decorations up the kazoo
lives alone on his disability
says he does anyway
glum and i dont do war heroes
luther its a beautiful morning now and hes walking up the steps to the art museum
he seems in a terrific mood as he goes inside b absolute power rev
seth has been on the steps of the museum watching him
now quickly luther inside peering back out at seth
and he doesnt seem in as terrific a mood now
he hesitates keeps on going
outside and he knows luther was watching
the usual group has gathered sketching away
luther is deeply engrossed in his labors
seth enters the room casually taking it all in
he approaches the group ends up behind luther who is intent on getting the hands right
not looking boy you must be smart
really taken aback sorry
usually takes a week for you guys to get to me
turns smiles you look just like your picture seth
im luther whitney
he reaches out to shake a surprised seths hand they walk in go to the food line
there is throughout a bantering tone
not that it matters but these two in a different world would like each other theyre both in their own ways deeply moral men
so do you want my confession now or after coffee
as luther draws some coffee from an urn doing the same before i send you away for life i should probably check out your alibi
watched the bullets game with red bransford
prison buddy of mine runs a bar want to question me about the game
im probably lying
they each give the cashier some money and we see a quiet table in the corner as they head for it
you been following the case
nods vigorously i love true crime f
feels only a few guys could have handled something as hard as the sullivan job
touches his notebook ive got a list here youre on it
nothing shows i wish it was true
shakes his head your robber actually went in the front door but came out down a rope in the dark in the middle of the night
as seth nods luther sighs if only i could do stuff like that id be the star of my a
luther and seth as they sit
seth smiles looks at luther
why was this so hard
now hes surprised
he kind of smiles
you want me to help solve your case
just looking for insight
how would you scratch that how would one go about it
what kind of person do you think i should be looking for
like a shot older fella
now he smiles because
the secret is just research research research from everything ive read
this hasnt gone at all the way he thought and hes starting to get fascinated
research for what
well from what i can tell on the tube its not a small house
as seth nods there had to be an architect right
youd be able to tell which one from public records in the library
and once you know the office you could break in and find the plans and xerox them get them back before morning
not just steal them
seth breaking in isnt hard whats hard is breaking in so no one knows youve been there
now after the architect next youd want the contractors office and the security companys office
beat you know the skill involved breaking the security of a security company
shakes his head i wonder how those guys do it
why go to all that trouble
papers said he kept the money in a vault yes
as seth nods well im guessing there was probably some secret way to open it casually clicker fascinated explain gizmo looked like a v
remote shaking his head amazing beat must have been a lot of money inside
sipping casually a pause five million
and on those words luther more than he thought a lot more but of course nothing shows instead he breaks out laughing
whys that funny
the way you said it as if you were trying to surprise me
smiles i was trying to surprise you
smiles back there you go
seth sips his coffee takes out his notebook opens it
would the burglar use a disguise
seth youve got to get with the program you expect to catch this guy most likely it is a guy am i right
some kind of weird loner
maybe like you
couldnt agree more im the perfect prototype
sipping away but you see any face often enough youll start putting things together
thats why these top guys disguise themselves
i read a great article a couple of years back damn i wish i could remember where anyway it was about these makeup experts some of them use wigmakers people
flipping a page go on about the wigmakers
glancing at his watch id love that but im late as it is got to get my pacemaker checked
he likes seth all this excitement you understand
and he likes luther a you dont have a pacemaker and b ill be back tomorrow
tomorrow is promised to no one
hold on luther
luther is throwing clothes into a suitcase while talking on the phone not til morning
makes a face ill be by early he hangs up shuts the suitcase takes off out the door a place weve seen briefly before
moonlight through the windows
the sound of a key in the door
luther enters takes out a tiny flashlight
were in one largish room books all over
the home of someone who doesnt care a whole lot about their home
he opens the fridge
disaster still water sparkling water carrot sticks
sadly muttering katie darling youve gotta try real food sometime
he closes the door moves back into the room a graduation photo of kate
luther touches it with a fingertip moves on through the silence
luther by the bed now he flashes his light around what the light illuminates a bed table full of law books
a phone answering machine
the mandatory lamp
a proud mother and daughter picture
the daughter is kate
the mother is a fine looking woman with a kind face
b absolute power rev
half a dozen more shots as kate grew up the mother grew older
mother and daughter mother and daughter
nothing unusual here at all
so why is luther so sad
a white brick weather beaten building old glory fighting the breeze
i am having this press conference here because
richmond speaking on a podium
the press corps stands in front of him tv crews of all kinds cnn the most noticeable
it is here at this courthouse that christine sullivans killer will be tried for his crime
burton and collin in the b
scanning the crowd
gloria russell stands behind them
the same shot only now its grainy were watching it on a tv screen
cnn on the tube
a bartender cleaning glasses otherwise not a whole lot going on
now luther enters dressed for travel
he goes to a stool orders a ginger ale puts his passport and ticket on the bar glances toward the tv
turn that off okay
finishing up the glasses in a sec
richmond at his press conference
he speaks without notes and he speaks beautifully
as you know i came from an impoverished family in an impoverished town but we lived with our doors unlocked
russell watching listening she loves hearing him talk
we all lock our doors now but that is not what concerns me
burton and collin scanning the crowd
we are also locking our hearts
that is the sadness that is the loss
richmond and suddenly hes like a southern minister
we are locking our hearts to the cries of the weary we are locking our hearts to the poor and their pain
an old man standing behind russell
we realize its walter sullivan
sisters and brothers we are locking our hearts to ourselves
he has aged shockingly in the past couple of days
luther staring sympathetically at the devastated old man
sullivans image suddenly is gone the bartender has turned off the television
politely put it back on
b absolute power rev
starting to argue you said cutting through do it cnn
walter sullivan is still there
we feel savagery and violence must be allowed a place at table
beat that is wrong
that is not america
i shall fight that battle
luther staring at the image of walter sullivan who is heartsick and beaten
luther is simply transfixed richmond on cnn and now he has turned and is beckoning for walter sullivan to join him
sullivan for a moment is uncertain
he points to himself do you mean me
richmond nods opens his arms out wide
sullivan gets up comes forward
luther as he gets up too also comes forward leaving the stool walking close to the television
richmond and sullivan grainy on cnn as richmond embraces sullivan holds him in a loving embrace
dear friend old friend we shall fight that battle
sullivan too overcome by the moment can only nod
who can explain the ways of chance
if we had never met i would not be president
if christine had not taken ill she would be with you in barbados even now
oh walter youve always been like a father to me
i would give the world to lessen your pain
the press corps
richmond and walter
they turn face the cameras
the presidents arm is still around the old man they both blink back tears and now here it comes
tears of rage in his eyes
a rage so deep it shocks him you heartless prick building you fucking bastard the bartender surprised turning toward luther
he starts to say something stops something tells him to shut up and he does
richmond wiping away tears alone on camera
luther wiping away tears in the bar
a shot of the two of them luther and richmond one on cnn one in reality because luther has moved so close to the tv he and richmond could almost
be staring at each other
whispered now im not running not from you
beat im going to bring you down
hold on the two men
seventy very excited people weve never seen before
they stare around at their surroundings they are in the white house
on a guided tour
b absolute power rev
a bright late morning of whats going to be a beautiful day
a guide leads the people through a doorway
they troop happily along
luther is with them he seems happy too
the guide leads the people through
they look around chat with their friends follow the guide out
luther follows the guide out too
hold on the room
all is as it was
except a large envelope has been dropped on a side table
move in on the envelope its addressed to gloria russell
her doors are closed russell is at her desk
burton stands alongside
collin silent sits in a corner
and on her desk half out of the envelope is a photo graph of the letter opener
he was in the building he took a guided tour
burton pulls the picture all the way out studies it
ive never dealt with blackmail trying for calm he doesnt want money exploding you a mind reader too
under control no i just looked on the back shows her see
luther has written something
reading i dont want money
russell is more upset
burton almost smiles
admiringly this guy sure has the guts of a burglar
wish we had him
you finished your recruiting speech
because id like to know how i handle this
like you handled the letter opener
she studies burton
then gee bill that could be construed as criticism
do you really want me as an enemy
burton stands there massively powerful
his voice when he speaks is his usual voice polite considerate
miss russell i should have called the police that night
but i was weak
you convinced me to stay silent
i regret that
another pause know this every time i see your face i want to rip your throat out
fine you win the pissing contest then suddenly almost like a little girl what should i do
nothing because hes making a terrible mistake he thinks he has time he doesnt seth franks too good
hell bring him in
his first words then i kill him
now from them she is we will find a top prosecutor for the common wealth of virginia
her office is a zoo
on her desk a baby picture of kate and her mom smiling but there is something a little different about it
seth enters and they shake
he glances around sees the photograph glances away
kate has risen now and in the silence its clear that even though they are both standing still they are both circling
trying for a smile for a tough prosecutor you dont resemble your reputation miss whitney
the same is that good or bad
before seth can reply look lieutenant i told you on the phone im simply not involved with my father so this may not be a waste of time for you
but it sure is for me
what would you do if i just turned around and left
report you as an incompetent
a real smile now youre exactly like your reputation miss whitney as they head out they enter
the instant theyre alone im assuming your fathers a big part of you what
you think its all coincidence
hes a thief and you just happen to be the toughest prosecutor in the area
just amazed wow that never crossed my mind you think there might be some connection
like maybe im somehow compensating
i better write that down
a banged up couch
kate sits shrugs
i think you can help me
lieutenant i dont know the man he was in jail when i was a kid when he got out my mother and i went off to live by ourselves
we dont make contact
he doesnt care about me
ive seen him all of once this past year
couple days ago
he said he might be going away
i just helped you
can i go back to work now
shakes his head any idea where he might have gone
seth and kate realize something in a different world under different circumstances theyd probably be starting an affair
snappishly quit wasting my time if he doesnt want you to find him youre not going to find him
you saying hes left town skipped the country what
im saying you wont recognize him
im saying he could be just around the corner he always kept a safe house cutting in where
b absolute power rev
he never said then whered you hear this
my mother loved him all right
even after she left him even when she was dying she always talked about him if only he hadnt this if only he could have that she stops
seth watching her
i meet a lot of asshole cops like you guys who o
d on columbo lady i may be an asshole cop but you dont know me well enough to call me one theres something else isnt there
something you want me to do
but you wont say seth
but he wont say
for the first time now apprehension
now the row of small neat houses where luther lived
kate and seth get out of his car go to the front door
how long did he live here
seth stoops gets the key from under the terra cotta planter
strange place for a thief to leave a key dont you think
quick memory he always did that
its surprisingly tidy
seth and kate as they move along
seth is watching kate who suddenly stops dead
a large blowup of the same picture kate had in her office the one of kate and her mom with one startling change luther is in this shot standing there
proud and smiling
she has ripped his presence out of her photo
seth silently watching kate
she turns sharply away
he gestures for her to follow
clothes tossed all over
he sure took off in a hurry
what scares a professional thief like that
she has seen something across the tiny room and is drawn to it luthers bed table and here it is
call it a montage call it a collage call it what you will we are looking at dozens of photographs all of them featuring kate
many of them we saw in her apartment only here as in the photo over the mantle luther is there with kate and her mom
we are looking at a shrine
and there are newer photos too kate at her college graduation kate at her law school graduation kate and her mother coming out of an elegant restaurant kate alone on
the steps of middleton county courthouse these are not posed shots
she looks wonderful and alive in all of them kate

she sits heavily down on the bed
fighting tears but he wasnt at those places
pointing to the grown up photos college graduation law school graduation the night mom and i celebrated when i got a job and me alone on the steps
id just won my first case i was so proud
still fighting i used to think

kate staring at the photos trying to get control

b absolute power rev
seth taking it down
an open air place near my office the cafe alonzo seths excited
taking it down
four oclock its deserted then
burtons excited too
high in the sky middle of the night now
pacing across her small apartment back and forth back and forth
alone in his office going over plans sipping coffee to stay awake
alone in his bed staring at the ceiling a nearly empty scotch bottle in one hand
listening to the phone machine
we hear kates voice
i miss you
luther hangs up immediately dials again
we hear the message start over
i miss you
as he continues to listen
on whats going to be a gorgeous day
burton yawning blowing into a steaming paper cup of coffee
collin wide awake moves alongside
collin is carrying a rifle
we are at a government firing range
collin squints into the morning sun
burton putting down the coffee cup picking up a pair of binoculars
burton and collin staring out a distant target is being raised
he strokes the barrel of his high powered rifle
a long way off
as he has focused the binoculars seen through the binoculars as it comes clear the bulls eye is small
with his rifle
his fingers still move along the barrel
no hurry whatsoever and then it all goes fast and in one motion he is aiming and firing and firing again and the sound explodes and burton dazed
the bulls eye has been totally blown away
luther and a salesman are engaged in conversation
luther is buttoning a new raincoat to the throat
the salesman holds several hats
luther picks one tries it on
i need to look really good today
he doesnt like the hat
as luther tries the other hat very rakish he likes it its a woman i can tell
as luther nods never too late is it
you got that right
now from his happy face pull back to reveal the workmen are on a scaffolding two stories up struggling to replace a glass panel that has cracked
the glass panel is heavy and bulky and the workmen are having a bitch of a time with it
the entire front of the building is glass panels
it mirrors the area across the street a bunch of dilapidated brownstones
b absolute power rev
they are empty and according to a sign are due for demolition
all the windows of the brownstones are closed except one
on an upper story
inside the window
michael mccarty who we last met at walter sullivans is there
he looks out
the glass building and the struggling workmen and on the ground floor a few tables are set outside with large umbrellas alongside each
there is a sign cafe alonzo
beside him is a leather case
he opens it
a very high powered rifle
mccarty begins to expertly assemble it taut and businesslike
seth taut and businesslike stands by a blown up map of the cafe alonzo area
the restaurant is circled and around it are marked places for policemen to wait seth is giving instructions to those policemen now fifty of them
and no ones smiling
dressed and ready
lying on her bed
she gets up makes it halfway to the front door cant do it she turns goes back to bed lies down again frozen
the cursing workmen
the glass panel is so damn cumbersome they are having a miserable time
b absolute power rev
an elderly couple sits at one of the half dozen outdoor tables
the place is empty
seth outside headquarters now giving instructions to police officers
behind them two dozen unmarked cars
later in the afternoon
burton getting out of his car at seths police headquarters
seth finishing instructing a dozen motorcycle cops
burton moves up behind seth waits quietly
as seth is done he sees burton they nod start toward seths car
the boss is very grateful
figured hed like an eyewitness report of the capture
this is our guy if hes innocent he sure took off awful fast
the three workmen
making some headway with the bulky glass panel now crosshairs cover them and we pull back to reveal b absolute power rev
mccarty staring out the window of the brownstone the rifle pointed very relaxed he pulls the trigger the rifles not loaded yet and the staccato click is all we hear
seth and burton moving quickly into the lobby of the glass office building that adjoins the cafe alonzo the lobby has a clear view of the outdoor part of the
around and behind them dozens of cops get in position
around the corner from the glass building unmarked cars
motorcycles waiting in shadow out of sight
seth and burton
theyve both seen a lot which doesnt mean theyre not tense
burton takes out some tums offers them to seth
seth shakes his head brings out tums of his own
the three workmen and they hate their job
one of them glances down
now from the workmens angle a woman moves to one of the tables
they dont pay much attention
she hesitates then decides on the front table
she takes a breath
now crosshairs cover her face and we pull back to reveal mccarty as before with his weapon
he pulls the trigger again and again there is the click now he flicks away a grain of dust from the barrel then he puts the weapon down reaches out
and one bullet
its supersonic ammo
mccarty picks it up blows on it gently
he might be holding a child
burton and seth
they can see kate sitting alone in the late afternoon
and a goddamn waiter has appeared and is walking out toward kate
he is asian and very young
kate startled as the waiter calls out from behind her
as she spins around what you want please
his english could be a lot better
nothing thank you
gesturing you sit you eat please
seth and burton
this is not part of my brilliant master plan
they both crunch away
mccarty watching the waiter and kate
hes not happy either
he points a finger at the waiter goes boom
kate and its almost four oclock and shes not at her best
gesturing around im waiting for someone
he must eat too please
oh he will we both will well order half the menu but just not now the waiter nods finally he turns starts off
the waiter returning
thank you so much
the waiter nods again and this time he does go
kate watching him making sure
now she sits straight very shaky trying to hold it together
and now crosshairs cover her face as we pull back to reveal collin
he holds a very high powered weapon
it looks like it could kill from a thousand yards away
where he is and its not a thousand yards away hes in an unmarked van on the street even closer than mccarty
collin loading his weapon
his movements are skilled
his concentration is total
mccarty glancing out at the office building area
the three workmen on the scaffolding are fighting to right the glass panel
one of them grabs a rope connected to a block and tackle
he pulls on the rope
slowly the piece begins to rise
kate sitting alone studying her hands
seth and burton
the waiting is agony
its worse for her
she glances around nothing no one
all the time in the world
blows on his weapon slightly
kate and its a question of how much longer she can take it
her trembling is almost out of control she glances around again and and there he is
luther whitney himself and he looks splendid in his new raincoat and hat he moves along in the shadow of the office building toward the cafe walking with his usual
grace luther always seems to glide
mccarty in the window
spotting luther totally controlled
collin does the same
seth and burton and the instant luther is visible seth gestures toward the policemen get ready
brownstone mccarty day raising his rifle
collin raising his
the three workmen raising the glass panel
watching her father come closer
its hard to suppress a smile as he walks towards his daughter
kate still watching
luther almost there
i did not kill that woman kate
mccarty flipping off the safety
collin doing the same
luther and kate and he starts to sit seth right hand raised hes about to start it all in motion
mccarty his finger floating to the trigger
collin doing the same
luther seated now and as at last he reaches out for his daughters hand the three workmen and for a moment the glass panel slips and tilts and as it
catches the afternoon sun mccarty blinded as the red reflection hits his eyes but he fires
luther and kate as suddenly the umbrella at their table is severed and starts to topple
collin startled and he fires too
luther instantly diving toward kate as the second bullet explodes in the pavement close by
seth stunned because this is crazy and burton stunned eyes wide
luther taking kate down to the sidewalk protecting her body with his body and madness
because all goes nuts now as there are shouts and screams and people running this way that way seth is in the center of it all shouting instructions racing with
burton out of the building b absolute power rev
unmarked cars fill the street a hundred uniformed policemen charge motorcycles roar in from everywhere kate lies dazed staring at the chaos here come thirty uniformed policemen and here come
thirty more mccarty races out of the back of the building leaps into a sportscar guns away collin disassembles his rifle scrambles from the van burton stays close to seth watching it all the three workmen look down at it all then they look at each other in total confusion what the fuck is going on
because what they see is that the recently deserted plaza is now stuffed with cops and more cops and vehicles and here come more and here come even more and
kate sits now staring around looking for luther and seth in the middle of it all stares around looking for luther because where the hell is he
a black police lieutenant shouting for his men to spread out
b absolute power rev
burton turning turning trying to make sense of it all
three police sergeants on motorcycles gunning through the crowd
kate standing now looking down and then she sees it on the ground where luther was a new raincoat and a new hat and seth and its all gone wrong
and its all going crazy and there is noise and there are shouts and there are whistles
the black police lieutenant breaking into a run chasing after someone we cant quite make out
a tall uniformed police lieutenant entering cafe alonzo he passes a couple of guys in chefs hats and the chinese waiter who just gapes out toward what was his service
area the tall uniformed police lieutenant moves gracefully past its luther
he goes to the front door of the place glances back toward where the noise is still mounting shakes his head out the door and gone
the door to kates apartment opening and seth coming in with kate
kate is as drained as youd expect
glancing around messy
i like that in a woman
she doesnt smile
seth giving her back her keys and a piece of paper
his voice is raw from all the shouting
b absolute power rev
top numbers local police as she nods other two are my office and home
off another nod i live alone too call anytime
want me to get someone to spend the night
i just need some sleep
ive got surveillance outside
and im keeping it on til this is over
ive got a feeling hes going to try and contact you
youre on a hot streak i guess
listen im sorry
nothing to say
anything unusual call me right away not a bother i live alone
he knows that feeble huh
they look at each other
then he starts toward the door
anything for the road
ive got water and water
they enter and she opens the fridge
and its full of food milk and fruit and cookies
kate stares then quickly glances at seth
he just points to a bottle
pelligrino would be great
off kate who cant help it breaks out laughing whats funny i say it wrong
tired is all
as she hands him a bottle
as they move toward it
he opens it
i dont think ive told you this but i live alone
and this time as she does smile and he does go lock it behind me
locking it loudly hows that
try and sleep
his footsteps get softer disappear
still facing door her back to her apartment i betrayed you luther
you better know that now
youre not the first
as kate turns luther standing there is looking at her
whyd you come
you have to know im not a murderer
no this afternoon
to the restaurant
whyd you come then
you must have suspected something or you wouldnt have been prepared
simply my daughter wanted to see me
he points to the couch as kate sits
luther and before shes even seated hes into it
the robbery went fine til they came in
they were drunk
i hid in the vault
sex got rough
he was going to kill christy but she turned the tables was going to kill him
two guys came in shot her dead
the same two guys who tried for you this afternoon
probably only one of them
i think walter sullivan might have hired the other
pretty powerful enemy good going
not as powerful as the president of the united states
kate just looks at him
richmond was drunk
the two guys are secret service
chief of staff russell planned the coverup
kate just looks at him
b absolute power rev
not a great reaction
little shake of the head
every word true
youre saying youre innocent of the murder
why in the world should i believe you
because i swear on matties grave
rocked luther going to her
on your mothers grave kate you know id kill myself before id lie about that
looking at him
because he wouldnt lie not about that
everything hes told her all true
the air goes out of her
soft jesus luther
theyll kill you
b absolute power rev
can you run
luther as he sits beside her on the couch
i was set to
at the airport
all the money id ever need
but i saw that bastard using sullivan on the t
maybe i couldnt have saved that woman kate
but i didnt even try
beat i know what you think of me and i know what weve been to each other beat havent been to each other
and its not the time to try and explain my life watching his face now
but ive never robbed anyone couldnt afford it and ive never stiffed a waitress
beat and alan richmond has to pay
what can you do
not much maybe but i only went to jail when i had partners
beat people betray each other kate nowadays when theres a group someone wants to write a book b absolute power rev
beat these people hate each other
and if i can drive them just a little bit nuts who knows how theyll react under pressure
rises and looks at her glad for the talk wish wed had more
luther crosses to the door turns
this is probably it you understand that
as she does he still looks at her
then i was never going to tell you this but i watched you argue a case last year thank god you got your brains from your mother
kate standing now too theyre across the room from each other
its dangerous outside
it always is beat and i may not make you proud kate soft but im not going down alone
and on that
an elegant high rise in washington
crisp cool afternoon
a doorman stands outside enjoying the day
a well dressed man rounds the corner he holds a small beautifully wrapped package with a small envelope attached
he moves to the doorman
its luther for miss gloria russell
he hands it over
taking it want me to sign anything
shakes head i trust you
and he turns walks quickly away as we the envelope being opened
its early evening now
the message inside is short and clear gloria thanks for the rescue
russell smiles and as she opens the package a beautiful necklace
antique mostly likely
and tasteful we hear the sound of an orchestra playing pull back to reveal gloria russell looking just splendid the necklace around her throat entering a large and very impressive
white house dinner dance
clearly an important affair of state
weve never seen russell quite like this relaxed secure in her femininity
she nods distantly to burton and collin who are as always close the president
for the first time now we realize something gloria russell is hot for alan richmond
richmond on the edge of the dance floor chatting with some elderly couples several of them european all of them wealthy
as russell approaches youre a vision this evening miss russell
b absolute power rev
thank you mr
beat and thank you mr

off her radiant indicating the necklace come again
this time she touches it he bends close to her
whispering you sent it to me this afternoon
long pause then
well of course
now to the others excuse me all i am overcome with the desire to dance with my chief of staff
a hand to her russell beaming moves out onto the dance floor with him
everyone at the gathering watching them
richmond and russell very much aware that all eyes are on them what we dont know is this they are both wonderful dancers
and they seem to be reveling in their moves because throughout this they never stop smiling
what is this nonsense
im hoping theres an explanation
b absolute power rev
surprised your gift alan i was overwhelmed and your note was so gratifying cutting in i sent a note
yes yes you think i dont know your writing
i assumed you wanted me to wear it tonight
he looks at it as they spin gracefully
it is lovely gloria and you know what else
they do a perfect dip
christy sullivan wore it the night she was killed
russell a quick glint of panic a gentle peal of feminine laughter
richmond and russell he bends her back their mouths are close
you realize what this means
whitneys been heard from
they spin and glide
then its not precisely the first time mr
the music is building to climax now
their movements become more grand
b absolute power rev
so happy youve been keeping things from me
only because you have so much on your plate alan we wanted to spare you
beat he sent me a polaroid of the letter opener yesterday
a kick in the teeth he summons all his control goes into even more complicated movements
the crowd of elegant men and women its really wonderful dancing theyre seeing they start to applaud
richmond and russell hearing the sound
richmond acknowledges it with a smile as they come to climax
well now a final flourish i need time to think come see me in my office in the morning beat this will certainly make for an interesting chapter in my
and as they bow
the crowd applauding louder while on the dance floor the president of the united states and the chief of staff applaud happily back
as the sound builds luther in the night
he is moving across the rooftop of a home
he carries a briefcase luthers making business calls
ahead is an attic window as he slides it open
luther slipping inside
some stairs are just across
he goes down them opens the door luther stepping into the main part of the dark house
no noise at all except that of someone breathing deeply coming from an open bedroom door
luther passes by for an instant we can see that burton is asleep an empty bottle by his head
luther rounding a corner and we can tell immediately hes in a different house now
burtons had only old furnishings these are modern and new
luther pauses listening
he moves forward then turns another corner and now we can tell hes someplace else this is an apartment with a large window looking out on the city
luther doesnt stop to admire the view
he moves silently on
hold on the window
and suddenly dawn the sun is starting to rise
pull back to reveal gloria russell as the alarm goes off
she sits she stretches then she stares something has been taped to her lamp
we are looking at an issue of the washington post russells photo smiles out there is a headline that says simply russell to be chief of staff
written across her picture are the words this shitstorm is your fault if we go down you go down
russell takes the paper down stares at it
burton hung over staggering into the kitchen of his home stopping dead
a newspaper is set beside his coffee pot
a front page of the washington post
the lead article reports that a siege has been successfully broken burton bloody and wounded is being carried to an ambulance
across the top these words have been written burton stares
collin yawning going into his bathroom across his mirror is taped a large white piece of paper across which is written in thick black marker if you could shoot for
shit wed be out of this
collin angrily rips it down
a bunch of commuters and businessmen are buying papers
washington new york philadelphia and theyre all different front pages of course but one photo in all of them is the same every one of them is running the mug
shot of luther
and the sense of the stories is the same too crowded around making their purchases
some of them are young some of them are half asleep
one of them is in his s and very wide awake its luther as he buys a paper looks at the headline fascinated
still early morning collin is going through burtons desk hurriedly when burton surprises him pissed what are you doing
closes the desk shrugs needed a pen
pointing to his desktop theres pens moving in you dont trust me
pissed i dont answer to you asshole russell in the doorway now glaring at them
youre both assholes now move and on that the note that was sent to russell and the polaroid of the letter opener
pull back to reveal the polaroid and the note are on richmonds desk
he studies them
russell burton and collin stand silently watching him their hatred of each other clear
the smell of deaths in the room
holding the note now his voice is when he speaks calm to burton any idea who could have forged it
b absolute power rev
i talked to seth frank apparently whitney learned how in prison
very gifted man
the window as he walks to it looks out
and are we close to stopping him
were working round the clock
good to know that
hell make a mistake
good to know that too
with more meaning than the words convey there is one other thing youll want to take care of
the other three looking at richmond
youre sure you want to do that
nods shes a young prosecutor prosecutors ask questions she might know what he knows
a reassuring smile lets get cracking shall we
beat show you love your country
on those words
kate whitney getting into the elevator
off to work
she pushes for the lobby
the doors close and the elevator starts down
kate checks her purse to see if she has everything
the l is lit but when the elevator gets there it does not stop but goes straight on down to the basement
she instinctively moves to the rear of the car
odd sounds from the basement
kates just the least bit tense
the odd sounds are louder
and the doors dont open when they should
and now shes starting to get a little scared
the doors sliding open and the super standing there with tools
smiling sorry miss whitney but this things giving us a little trouble
kate nods smiles back relieved
b absolute power rev
kate leaving her building going toward her car getting in
down the block is a police car
two surveillance cops inside
kate starts to drive and so do they
kate turns a corner and so do they and as they do they pass luther parked on the corner
satisfied he drives off in another direction
luther heading out of the city
the sun is higher in the sky
traffic is moving slowly
luther continues to drive
kate coming out of her office building hurrying along the sidewalk
she goes past some brownstones the two cops walk behind the window of one of the brownstones is open shadowy movement from inside kate hurries past not paying attention
cops dont either
now a figure begins to appear in the window the figure holds something long and thin like a rifle barrel its a large woman with a long mop as she
shakes it afternoon and the sun is strong
sunlight streaming in an open bedroom window
whose bedroom though
two maids are cleaning it and now we realize where we are walter sullivans bedroom but its all been changed different rug different fabrics different furnishings
the maids work silently and well
a final sweep of a dust rag here a last tug at the bedspread there
they go to the door take a last look around
hold on the empty room
now silently the vault door opens a gardener steps out clicker in hand
the gardener its luther he clicks it tosses it back inside the door starts to close but before it shuts we can see hes returned what he took the night
of the robbery
and as he moves silently toward the door
the outskirts of washington
mid afternoon now
luthers at a pay phone
seth as he picks up the phone kate okay
where are you
im not staying on long enough for you to track this just answer me
she couldnt be in better hands talk about catching a break secret service called me
theyre taking over surveillance the telephone swinging back and forth and in the b
a car motor roaring away
kate coming down the elevator again in her jogging clothes now
she has pushed the lobby button
the elevator stops suddenly on the second floor the super gets in smiles
got it working fine miss whitney
kate nods smiles back luther driving like crazy through the city
kate getting into her car in front of her building driving off no one is behind her
luther honking his horn as he barrels around a corner scattering traffic
b absolute power rev
kate drives into the park past a sign reading luther gunning along up ahead the park is visible now
kate following an arrow that leads to the parking lot
luther in the park now suddenly shouting shit as we a detour sign
kate entering the parking lot
luther out of his car now running like crazy through the park
ahead is a sign saying jogging path
not many other cars so she gets a space in front overlooking the river and as she stops takes out her keys collin at the wheel roaring in behind her
rear ending her hard
there is a screech of brakes and a scream luther as he hears the terrible sound keeps running
kate in her car as it teeters at the edge and then starts its long fall to the jogging path far below
b absolute power rev
burton and collin in their car driving like hell away
luther running into view stopping dead helpless now staring at the worst thing in the world kates car careening against a rocky ledge then cart wheeling the rest of the
way down landing horribly spinning finally coming to rest upside down and luther running to the car hands shaking he manages to pull front door open and reach inside now there are cries as other joggers stop and stare and kate as luther pulls her body out of the wreckage
no response its impossible to tell if shes alive in the distance now the sound of an ambulance
the ambulance siren screaming
pull back to reveal early evening now getting dark and the ambulance braking in front of the emergency room of a large city hospital as doctors and attendants with gurneys
come pouring out
a private room
kate is bandaged and attached to a bunch of equipment but however faintly her breathing its still breathing and its steady
shes alone for the moment in the semi darkened room
a doctor comes walking along its collin
kate in her room sleeping
another doctor is with her now checking her charts
he sees whats going on stops pulls out a small notebook pretends to read it all the while glancing toward kates room with the one doctor still there now from
around the corner noise coming closer several people approaching perhaps more
collin turns away from the sound curses then stops the doctor is done with kates charts
from around the corner now the group coming closer still
kates doorway as the doctor exits and collin enters they pass each other collin moves a step further into the room and now there is something in his hand a
out of it
lying there eyes closed
collin the needle ready moving silently toward the bed
kate is barely breathing
and now suddenly collin is barely breathing because the other doctors arms have viced around collins neck forcing the air out of him
collin stunned trying to struggle the doctor jerking collins body into the air his feet are dangling now the hypodermic needle drops to the bed as the struggle goes on
and collins in fabulous shape
hes young and power ful and hes been in terrible situations before and he knows how to fight and hes been taught to defend himself and tough shit the doctor
its luther relentlessly increases the pressure against collins throat collin cant even gasp now his feet cant kick anymore his body starts to go limp his eyes start to slide up into his head silence in the room its almost over which is when suddenly luther lets go
collin eyes flickering open as luther lays him down on the floor
all this next is whispered
which do you want most for me to kill you or life in jail forever
he has gone across the room to the bed
collin tries to move cant
the hypodermic needle as luther picks it up carefully starts back to collin
going to guess this wasnt to pep her up
b absolute power rev
staring eyes wide youre not going to kill me
why do you think that
you could have but you didnt
kneeling by collin now
thats because you didnt know your crime prick
and now he jams the needle against collins neck
collin tries to cry out but luther covers his mouth
kneeling close almost whispering into collins ear i didnt mind you tried to shoot me at the restaurant i wouldnt have minded if youd nailed me at sullivans part of
the job beat but you fucked with blood
luther bending over him
luther pushes the plunger
im fresh out
collin dying now
his breathing is getting strange his body starting to stiffen
and on that daddy
kate eyes barely open
from her position luther is simply kneeling nothing else is visible
go to sleep honey
she tries to stay awake cant make it drifts off
she closes her eyes
luther closes his eyes for him
now a gurney with a figure on it being pushed by a doctor
a dumpster outside the gurney is there the figure isnt the sound of a car gunning into the night and we seth coming out of the shower
he puts a towel around him wipes the steam off the mirror cries out luther is standing there
i need one answer when you interviewed walter sullivan did he say why christy didnt go to barbados
shakes his head just that she changed her mind
studying luther you know who did it dont you
so will you check your phones incredulous whod tap a police officer
no reply luthers already headed for the door as we b absolute power rev
walter sullivan getting into his limousine in front of a georgetown mansion
later in the evening
the car starts to move
walter looks frail and very old now
and somehow smaller
walter huddled in the back seat as the street lights illuminate him
he might even be ill
in any case a sad figure
the limousine turning a corner

and i heard every word walter
for a moment no reaction
then he sits back hard
the airs out of him
he just breathes quietly
then thats not real proof
handing something back
sullivan takes it its the letter opener
sullivan leans back shuts his eyes
you could have stolen this
i did steal it
but that isnt my blood and those arent my prints
eyes still shut and hes very old and you expect tears but he didnt get to be walter sullivan by crying hold on walter and this incredible shriek of rage
luther suddenly stopping the car and were at the rear of the white house
he sits in the back a moment
then he gets out
luther has gotten out too
they stand close to each other
then walter starts away
turns quiet now at peace i did love her you know
and he walks away
a white house security guard as walter approaches
is he working late
i havent an appointment but id like to see him if i might
you dont need an appointment mr
and as he waves him through luther standing there watching the old man
walter a final turn back a nod of the head
he nods back returns to the car gets in and now we begin a blizzard of cuts
luther driving through the night
walter entering the white house proper
seth with a bunch of other officers standing in front of an office with the name bill burton on a plaque he opens the door b absolute power rev
burton has blown his brains out
a note alongside reads i am so sorry
alongside the note is a micro cassette recorder and a dozen tapes
walter sullivan approaching a metal detector he starts to go through it goes off walters embarrassed
he holds up his wrist showing his watch
the security guards smile wave him to go ahead
walter continues on
luther tense roaring along
gloria russell seth is with her he cuffs her leads her out walter by the door of the oval office
the letter opener is tight in his hand now
the door opens
richmond arms out comes to embrace him as he embraced him at the press conference
luther pulling up into the parking lot of the hospital getting out passing the parking lot attendant who is listening transfixed to a small radio
b absolute power rev
in the greatest shock to the nation since the kennedy assassination president alan richmonds death has rocked
luther has moved past now we cant hear the radio anymore
a number of people are present all of them listening to a large radio on the desk of the information clerk
richmond died violently in the oval office and walter sullivan
luther has moved past now we cant hear the radio anymore
luther sits alongside in a chair
outside the moon is high in the sky
kate blinks half opens her eyes sees luther
youre still here
she dozes again
a coffee machine in a lounge
but a television luther enters gets some coffee
the tv is showing the press conference richmond held
as we watch walter sullivan moves down toward the president and they embrace
now the press conference is over and we are live at the front of the north portico of the white house
a ton of reporters and walter sullivan in their midst beckoning for quiet
mister sullivan have you no idea why the president took his own life
luther stops making coffee looks at the screen
voice soft i know hes been feeling the pressure of office more than ever lately
weve talked about it a great deal
but why would he stab himself
sadly thats a question that will haunt me forever
of course i tried to stop him beat alan was like a son to me
luther smiles takes his coffee leaves the room as we kate sleeping
seth stands there now
luther enters with his coffee
seth sees him and they both move to the door and confer silently seth indicates kate
luther crosses his fingers
seth says something we cant make out
seth glances a final time at kate then leaves them
luther moves to kate studies her face
b absolute power rev
eyes still closed was that seth
he was just checking in
when youre up to it he said we might come over for dinner
he mentioned eyes half open i know he lives alone smiles watch it now
he arranges her sheets
you dont have to fuss
you were forever catching colds
she nods drifts and we starting to fall out of the sky now
stands by the window looking out
he stretches crosses to her
am i going to be all right
long pause well be fine
kate nods drifts
luther watches her
then he goes to his chair
reaches down pulls out his sketchbook
he turns the pages
drawings of kate
he turns to a new page
starts drawing her again
hes really getting good
hold on luther and kate
