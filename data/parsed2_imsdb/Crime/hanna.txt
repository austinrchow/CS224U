written by seth lochead winter
silence on the forest floor
then the sound of breathing
the soft footfall of a person running
hanna fourteen years old long hair eyes like blue ice glides through the trees a bow strapped to her shoulder
she is dressed in animal skins and fur shoes
she blends almost completely into the landscape of trees and snow
she stops dead
her breath visible in the freezing air
suddenly alert she has spotted her prey
a reindeer nuzzling the snow trying to unearth a patch of grass to eat
its head pops up danger
the sudden swoosh and the snap of an arrow piercing its skin
the deer flops to the ground with a thud
it whines its feet dig at the earth
its mouth gnaws at the icy air
steam pouring from its nostrils
hanna approaches removes a fur glove
she bends to her knees
she reaches out and gently pets the animals frightened face
she runs her hand down along its neck in towards the wound
i just missed your heart
she stands and pulls out an old pistol from her waist holster
she fires two shots directly at camera
a knife enters the deer near its anus
remove the penis and scrotum make a deep circular cut around the rectum
hanna pulls the knife up towards the brisket
cut from the rear to the brisket
she works calmly without expression
the deer lies on its side
hanna breaths hard
she reaches deep into the body cavity and pulls out intestine stomach liver
she freezes sensing danger
her hand deep inside the animal
she looks out into the still forest
erik mid forties a mammoth with leathery face stands behind her like a ghost
ive killed you
hanna spins spraying deer blood on to the snow and brings her fist right to eriks face
he blocks and thumps an open palm on to hannas shoulder sending her sprawling into the snow
she leaps to her feet as erik aims a kick at her head
she dodges punches below his knee cap and goes for her pistol
erik slaps the hand away
use your hands
she goes for the gun again and again he stops her
he moves in tight pulling the gun from its holster and tossing it deep into the forest
hanna clips eriks temple sending him to the ground
she wraps her arms around his neck preparing to snap
but she cant
he throws her over his shoulder into a pile of snow
erik stands and wipes the snow from his pants
his face shows a touch of frustration
he plods into the forest
drag it back yourself
hanna drags herself to the deers side
she stares at its dead face
hanna clears the kill site
wipes the last dots of blood on to a stick
no sign she was ever there
hanna drags the lb deer on a makeshift sled
she lifts her knees high and moves at a steady pace
hidden among the trees a little way off erik is watching her
a log cabin built around an ancient tree surrounded by the thick forest
hanna is standing in the snow stripping the deer with a knife
its a tough job but she does it no fuss
almost everything erik and hanna own theyve made themselves using what can be found in the forest
what few possessions that have been brought in from the outside world are old and worn
hanna is making a fire using a bow drill
the friction of the drill produces an ember which hanna carefully transfers to some dried leaves
hanna and erik sit either side of a small fire still dressed in furs
hanna swirls a spoon around in a dish of stew
erik takes a mouthful watches hanna not eating
are you hurt
she keeps swirling her spoon
you were half asleep
ill do better next time
in german w english ill do better next time
in italian w english ill do better next time
hanna studies her food and slowly takes a spoonful
in spanish w english did you really want me to snap your neck
he looks at her drops the quiz
how much did you pull off the deer
a hundred and twenty with scraps
about pounds in total
that explains it
how you beat me
youre getting strong
hanna almost blushes
erik stands to put his bowl away
in spanish w english
im glad you didnt snap my neck
hanna is in bed under fur covers listening while erik reads to her from an old encyclopedia
the great blue whale is the largest animal to have ever existed
a blue whales tongue weighs over two and a half tons and its mouth is large enough to hold tons of food and water
how much is that
its bigger than the cabin
its heart weighs thirteen hundred pounds and a male has seven gallons of testicles
the blue whales music can be heard for over miles
he shuts the book
time for sleep
he stands by her bed looking down at her
did you forget something
erik takes hannas gun out of his pocket and puts it on the table next to her bed
he walks to the door
hanna stops him with a question
whats music like
its difficult to explain
he opens the encyclopedia again leafs through the pages and reads
a combination of sounds with a view to beauty of form and expression of emotion
but how does it feel
erik is not equipped to answer such esoteric questions
it feels good
its uh nice
tell me properly
can you play music
your mother could
she used to sing very well
id like to hear it for myself
you will soon enough
erik looks away from her questioning eyes
when youre ready
im ready already
they look at each other he weighs it up
just go to sleep now
ill see you in the morning
hanna covers herself in an animal skin as erik pulls a wattle screen across her bed strokes her hair gently for a moment and leaves the room
hanna reaches under her bed and takes out an old battered photograph taken years ago of a young woman with eyes like hers her mother joanna zadek
the morning sunlight slants through the forest
erik is walking through the trees
he stops raises his pistol at a tree trunk some distance away and fires
the tree breaks apart
hanna wakes with the sound of the gunshot
she is still holding her mothers photgraph
hanna pushes the photograph under her mattress and climbs out of bed
another gunshot breaks a tree apart
another tree breaks apart
she rolls and fires
she rolls and fires
hanna attacks erik
he defends easily
she repeats the motion
shes getting faster
her strikes are solid
a medium size log nailed along two pillars of the cabin acts as a chin up bar
erik and hanna do chin ups
both are fit
neither will give up
erik observing hannas power
both have the sense that he is judging her
hannas face fiercely determined
erik and hanna sit with their backs to a tree in the huge forest as they breathlessly recover from the exhaustion of the exercise
hanna speaks fast reciting
i live in leipzig
we live at number weissingerplatz
i go to school at the klaus kohle gymnasium and my best friends are rudi gunter and clara schliess
i like literature and sport in particular tennis and athletics
i have a dog called trudi
hanna is running racing erik
fierce determination almost anger in her eyes
they reach the river and dive in
hanna and erik are swimming hard against the current of the fast flowing river working at full pelt just to stay still
they swim and swim their muscles busting their lungs bursting
dont give up
dont give up
hannas arms flails as she fights against the stream and she screams in pain
she is grabbed under by the undertow and is pulled downwards
for a second she is underwater and in darkness but eriks hand pulls her back up and she breaks the surface with a gasp of relief
on the bank hanna climbs out
erik approaches her but moodily even angrily she pushes him away
i didnt need your help
her face sullen she walks away into the forest
he stares after her
outside erik stands alone thinking
an owl swoops down to catch a mouse then flies back up into the tree tops
hanna is asleep
erik enters the room
erik approaches the bed and solemnly takes out a pistol and aims it at hanna
he is tense with expectation
suddenly hanna bursts from her covers smashes the pistol from eriks hand and smashes him down on to the bed
she grabs the pistol and points it at his face
she is alert eyes intense face proud
she speaks quietly
im ready now
its a false beat
he lunges again at her really violently
he seems to be really trying to hurt her
but hanna has reached under her mattress and there is a flint knife in an instant it is at eriks neck
she pricks his neck slightly
it bleeds just slightly
stillness and silence
hanna breathless angry
you didnt tell me you had a knife
you told me to think for myself
isnt that what you want
she is angry for the first time
erik does not answer
just stares at her
i want to see things
i cant stay here forever
erik takes long lunging strides straight out from the cabin
he counts his paces
one two three four
erik and hanna are racing through the forest
over this we continue to hear erik counting his paces from the previous scene
five six seven eight
after paces erik makes a degree turn and enters the tree line
the snow and mud crunch under his boots
we continue to inter cut the following with more close ups of hanna training climbing fighting chin ups shooting
all the while we continue to hear erik counting out his paces
after paces with the cabin light distant erik falls to his knees
he unsheathes a large knife and jams it into the frozen earth
hanna comes out of the cabin rubbing her eyes and yawning eating a hunk of cold meat
she looks up to see a snow fox staring at her from the tree line
she crouches and holds out whats left of her breakfast
the fox approaches gingerly delicately
hello little foxy
come and share my breakfast
the fox comes to her and nervously accepts the scrap withdrawing a few feet to eat it
hanna shuffles forward carefully and gently pats the snow fox it is only a cub
as the fox eats it makes low grunting noises which hanna expertly mimics causing the fox to look up puzzled they seem to have a genuine connection as if theyve
done this before
suddenly the snow fox freezes pricks up its ears looks up hanna looks up too
an aeroplane is approaching overhead
the fox darts back into the undergrowth as the roar of the plane reverberates through the forest
hanna jumps to her feet and with incredible speed and dexterity climbs to the very top of a near by tree
the plane roars over her head and disappears over the snowy wilderness oblivious to hannas tiny presence
its only now that we see the full extent of hannas isolation
hanna enters breathless with excitement
erik sits pensively with his back to the door
did you see it
wasnt it beautiful like thunder
i had to stick my fingers in my ears it was so loud
did you hear it
she stops sensing eriks mood
sitting in front of erik is a metal case caked with frozen dirt
erik pops open the case
inside a tangle of technology
hanna looks at the case mesmerized
what does it do
it tells marissa wiegler where we are
he looks at her a hint of a challenge
when you want to leave here all you have to do is flip that switch
she approaches the box and places a single finger on the small red switch
but once its done therell be no going back
shell never give up until youre dead or she is
i wont be there to hold your hand
so be sure
be sure its what you really want
youre not scaring me
he looks at her disbelievingly
she shakes her head in protest but simultaneously moves away from the switch
he softens towards her
theres no rush
take your time
hanna turns her back on the box but cant help taking another look at it over her shoulder
hanna is under the covers again while erik reads more from the encyclopedia
laika a mongrel dog from the streets of moscow was the first animal to orbit the earth
she was launched into outer space on the third of november
scientists believed humans would be unable to survive conditions of outer space so flights by animals were viewed as an experimental precursor to human missions
her rocket was not designed to be retrievable and laika had always been intended to die
erik awkwardly turns the page to change subject
when a star collapses the supernova explosion is billion times brighter than other stars
hanna shuts her eyes and tries to imagine how bright that might be
erik straps the bow to his chest and grabs a quiver of bolts
will you hunt with me
hanna is sweeping the ground
if you want
its up to you
hanna eyes the box sitting open its waiting for her
erik leaves abruptly
hanna continues to sweep the ground her movements bring her closer to the metal box
she stops sweeping and looks at the box
she turns and walks out of the cabin
hanna comes out of the cabin and sits down on a tree trunk
she sees the snow fox cub but says nothing
it comes over and noses around the cabin but hannas mind is elsewhere
whispering to herself marissa wiegler
close on the metal box the switch catches the light from the door as hanna enters to confront it
the room is still and quiet
hanna approaches the metal box and slowly reaches out her hand
come and find me
close on she flips the switch a little red light begins to flash
an alarm clock begins to ring as we cut to close on a bedside alarm clock ringing loudly
marissa wiegler a handsome woman in her mid s with red hair reaches over and slams the alarm clock off
shes alone in her bed
she always is
she has no children
shes made choices in her life and lives without looking back
she walks into her ensuite bathroom and looks at herself in the mirror
she collects her toothbrush and bares her teeth in a snarl as she brushes them
her gums bleed a little
hanna tends to boiling pots
shes cooking a feast
he stamps his feet shedding ice at the door
he walks by the box and sees the little red light flickering on
hanna sees this and sees him smile but she knows hes sad
you were lucky to grab that deer
there was nothing out there today
erik looks over at the meal hanna is preparing
he wraps an arm around her shoulder
they dont hug much and it shows
hanna is almost defensive and tense
and then the hug is over
marissa wearing a sharp business suit drives a black acura into her designated spot in the cia hqs car park
as she gets out we see the parking space is designated for her young male pa and tech one are already waiting for her
weve had a signal reported by interpol
we think its eric heller
an unusual expression of shock on marissas face
well ill be
it seems hes in sweden
what the fuck is he doing there
living in the middle of nowhere like the frigging una bomber
the son of a bitch
the pa hands her a coffee and she hands him some files
apparently he turned on his locator
hes not an idiot
i mean i believe so
but thats what happened
after years in jokkmokk maybe hed rather go to prison
erik is leaning over a pail of water cutting his beard off with a knife
from the czech republic
i recruited him in when they were all joining the velvet revolution and sticking it to the commies erik now clean shaven opens a wooden case in the corner of
the room and takes out an old folded three piece suit and rolled shirt
he couldnt wait to kiss some yankee butt and make some bucks doing our dirty work
erik awkwardly begins to change into the suit
marissa sits in a video conference room surrounded by worried looking faces with her are her close advisors walt and bob
shes also speaking into a microphone on the table in front of her
trouble was he had his own way of doing things
walt fires up a computer screen and logs on
he uses an access code
this takes him to a new file
he enters the tracking device number
a name comes up
he clicks on a link
hellers face pops on to the screen
not a team player
not a ajoiner
a he became increasingly isolated and disturbed
kept mouthing off about classified programmes
walt clicks on a link to a newspaper article which comes on to the screen the headline police hunt for murder suspect
a picture of heller in the article and a smashed car on a rural road
the two men stare at his face
i kept warning and he kept getting worse
in the summer of he took his girlfriend johanna zadek on a trip to the baltic coast and blew her head off
walt hits a new link a still of the same young woman as the photo hanna was previously looking at in her bedroom
her name printed below it johanna zadek
never heard from him again
anybody know why
maybe the pressure got to him bob
you know what thats like
a male voice comes from the speaker this is lewis but we dont see him yet
what do you want us to do
bring him in
what do you mean
call the police walt
this is exactly the kind of shit we cant have out there anymore
he was one of ours we trained him
he kills some other poor woman and its a cluster fuck
tell it to interpol
let them pick him up
try him for murder
this has nothing to do with us
i dont understand
you dont have to
im making the call
bob and walt exchange a look
thank you gentlemen
thatll be all
the video screen flickers off people take their files and start to leave
marissa wiegler stands in the darkness
hanna sits in her bed reading her encyclopaedia
erik dressed incongruously in the suit and tie enters and sits on the edge of her bed
she doesnt look up from her book
his face shows more emotion than weve seen before
hanna looks up still trying to hide her fear
tell me again
the address where we meet
wilhelm grimms house
erik moves a strand of hair from hannas forehead and looks at her with paternal care
good night my sweet girl
he stands and quietly goes to the door when her voice stops him
he turns to look at her both their eyes full of trepidation
you can do this
just remember what ive taught you
she smiles reassuringly at him
ill see you there
erik comes out of the cabin carrying a small rucksack
he closes the door behind him and takes a deep breath
hanna gets out of bed and goes to the small window
she watches as erik walks away from the cabin for the last time
dusk in the forest as the flickering sun goes down
as peaceful a place as you could imagine
a calm blueness of impending night on the snow
then a series of ropes break the top frame and fifty us special forces dressed in white snow gear silently abseil down to the ground
hanna is doing push ups on her bedroom floor
infra red pov as the special ops team head through the forest wearing night vision goggles
the leader of the operation follows the tracker signal
is this guy one of ours
used to be
tread carefully hes been in there a long time hes damaged goods and he knows were coming
we see through the infra red vision the endless trees in the pitch blackness
the special ops forces get closer
they see the cabin in the night
silence in the darkness
just the breathing of men in the icy cold
hanna stops her push ups sensing the special forces approach
she silently springs to her feet and moves to the front of the cabin
she looks out and sees shadows moving among the trees
she turns and presses herself against the wall
the head of ops waves two special operatives forward
the rest of the forces surround the cabin but at a distance
the two men approach the cabin
one opens the door and the other steps in
then the first follows close behind
both are engulfed by darkness
the rest of the forces wait in silence for a radio signal
the head of special ops looses patience and picks up the radio
do you read me
i repeat do you read me
the head of ops waves all thirty of his men closer to the cabin
guns at the ready
the head of ops and five other men storm the cabin
through night vision we see the cabin interior
then the two special forces dead on the floor
then find hanna sitting quietly looking timid and unsure
just a little girl her eyes shining in the dark
marissa is walking through long concrete corridor as her phone rings
she answers quickly
what is it
maam this is lewis
marissa affects a abusiness as usuala tone
the target escaped
how did that happen
were thinking maybe he got away in the snow in the thick snow or
but hes in the wind and i have two men down
find him lewis
find him and take him out
they found a child his daughter
marissa turns pale
a cement box
hanna lies on a small bed
two american voices
she hasnt moved since we brought her in
has anyone talked to her
they want a psych evaluation before they interrogate
hanna lies on the cot
shes been cleaned up and is wearing an army regulation jump suit
the metal door drags open
a doctor burton closes the door behind him
he walks up to hello hanna
hanna lies motionless
my name is dr
would you like to talk to me
burtons voice has been trained to engender a state of peace and security
hanna sits up and hangs her legs off the side of the cot
i was told by my father to gain the upper hand
what else did your father tell you
where am i
youre in holding
this must all be very strange for you
youve been in the forest a long time
but i want you to know no ones going to hurt you
we just want to talk to you about your father
hanna seems to be staring up at the ceiling
he follows her eye line to the cctv camera above them
is that a camera
ah yes thats a camera
to keep a record
camera obscura its latin for dark chamber
lewis sits with the monitor watching hanna watching him
plug the cctv through to langley
monitor presses some buttons as lewis calls on his phone and speaks into it
you should have visual on the psych evaluation now
marissa alone in a langley obs room
no one else there
late at night in america
something secret about marissa here
on the screen she sees hanna in the interrogation room
her screen tells she is watching camp g interrogation room
marissa watches hanna intently
it was first described by the arabic scientist ibn alhazen in the year
whats she saying
marissa stares at her screen at the blank face of the fourteen year old hanna
focus in on marissas face as she studies this strange young woman
the sense that marissa knows more about this girl than she is letting on
on the screen burton continues to probe
can i get you something
what do you like
anything at all
hanna leans forward
looks at burton who encourages her with his eyes
i want to speak to marissa wiegler
marissa sits in stunned silence
did you hear that
marissa pauses before she answers
tell her ill be there tonight
just do it
a white space with specialist lighting and the hum of specialised air pressurizes
a protected environment this is the dna lab
a military doctor is looking at the result of something on a computer
it has shocked and intrigued him
he calls across to another doctor
john come and take a look at this kids blood sample
military doctor walks across
he sees the sample on the screen
is that right
that cant be right
and i got a sample of her hair
military doctor looks at the results baffled
that must be contamination
what would it be
run it again
hanna is sitting on her cot with her back against the wall
a metal door drags open
a pair of smart female shoes enter the room accompanied by the military boots of two guards
my name is marissa wiegler
you wanted to speak to me
hanna turns to look
it is a completely different woman dressed in similar clothes to marissa but not her
hanna stares at her then looks at the two guards
to the guards you can wait outside
the guards exit and the door slams shut behind them
in the observation room lewis is looking at a small monitor
he speaks into a consoles microphone
you should have visual
marissa wiegler sits alone in the empty cia langley headquarters watching the cctv relay
where am i
hanna stares at false marissa awaiting an answer
youre in a safe place
lets talk about your father
you must love him very much
where did you meet him
the false marissa pauses
marissa hears the question
thinks fast her mind totally focussed
tell her it was by a news kiosk in alexanderplatz east berlin
say it was raining
false marissa pauses looking at hanna
we see that she has a tiny microphone in her ear
at a news kiosk
in the rain
she smiles reassuringly
hanna nods looking at false lewis watches on the screen
but then gets a call from the military laboratory
sir we need to talk to you
weve run tests on the girl
his voice sounds urgent concerned
but marissa has interrupted
as the argument continues we see and hear on the screen the false marissa continuing to talk to hanna
do you know where your father is
in the obs room lewis half watching the screen explains to marissa on intercom
standard dna and meds
marissa alone in langley suddenly alert
send the results straight to me
on the screen false marissa is talking to hanna
did he tell you where he was going
were all worried about him
on the cctv hanna looks at the false marissa
she begins to cry holds out her arms to be held
the monitor sees her cry and turns to lewis who is still half embroiled in the tests discussion
lewis looks at hanna
the false marissa tentatively takes hanna in her arms
hanna coils her thin arms around the false marissas neck clinging to her like a monkey
the false marissa looks up to the security camera slightly concerned
hanna wriggles in her arms to get a better grip
marissa watches this strange image of her false self hugging this young girl
hanna begins to weep more and more burrowing her face into the false marissa
on the cctv we hear
you want me to give her something
hanna clutching on to false marissa nestles close weeping
i think it might be necessary
marissa watches now concerned
something is wrong
get her out of there
burton comes rushing down the corridor filling a syringe as he goes
he arrives at hannas door
the first guard opens hannas door
hanna hugs weeping on to the false marissa
burton hears the instruction to abort but too late
as suddenly and with total efficiency hanna snaps the false marissas neck
marissa stares in shock as her false self slumps dead to the floor
then she watches as hanna grabs the first guards handgun from his holster and fires two rounds into burtons skull
and two more into the first guards chest
lewis immediately presses the alarm bell
jee sus wept
on another screen lewis watches as the other guard tries to drag the metal door shut
he hits a fleshy door jam burton
hanna is upon him
marissa watches hanna aim straight at camera
hannas fierce eyes looking at her marissa cant help but pull away from the screen
hanna fires and the screen goes blank
lewis watches as one after another his cameras go down
but still theres no sign of hanna
shes a child for christsake
alarms are sounding and red lights flashing in the corridor
hanna walks fast along the corridor
she ducks into a door to avoid two centre guards running past dives down another corridor and walks through a pair of double doors with warning signs on them
protected environment classified she finds herself in the specialist military dna laboratory
the military doctors stare at her
one of them reaches for an alarm but hanna is too fast
she flies across the desk and smashing a glass test tube she cuts the doctors neck then turns and does the same to the other one
hanna looks round trying to find a way out
then she sees something on the desk
it is a file with a photo of herself clipped to it and a collection of papers she scans it and reads in several places the letters adna
a but before she has time to read properly she hears a female voice from outside the lab
this is sanders
im checking zone eleven
the female guard radios off then enters
she senses something
pov sanders the dna laboratory suddenly seems empty
the buzz of the labs lighting and the whir of the air pressurizes are the only sounds as the guard looks around
then the guard hears a rustling from behind her and tenses up
she turns around but hanna has vanished into thin air there is silence
hanna runs along the corridor
she has in her hands the dna results which she scrunches up and jams into a pocket
hanna eyes the vent above her
she peers around a corner her only other route of escape and sees military personnel reach the intersection close to hanna and spread out all going in different directions but
none coming towards her
the last pair of personnel start heading towards her
she looks up at the duct again and a length of ducting along the wall about waist height
she puts a foot on a rail halls herself up towards the vent
she fiddles with the vent eventually opening it as the personnel are almost upon her
she crawls through the narrow air conditioning duct
she stops alert to the sounds beneath her
through small perforations in a vent she sees more military personnel running down the corridor
the duct bends to a vertical angle
she begins to crawl up a steep gradient towards a crack of light
lewis sits in silence
monitor looks at him nervously
you think shes out
she cant get out
lewis picks up an internal telephone
whos on the perimeter
detail every unit available
hanna is sweating exhausted blinking in the darkness trying to make out what the light source is
the gradient has got steeper and she starts to slide backwards on the smooth metal surface
she digs her fingers into the rivets joining the plates of stainless steel trying to get a purchase
she summons the last of her strength and reaches a crest
she rests a moment then hauls herself over the crest and immediately starts sliding
she tumbles gathering pace falling down a long chute into the blackness
she has no idea where she is or whats happening but shes covering a lot of ground
she hits the bottom with a crunch and cries out
when she opens her eyes she sees more tunnel and at the end light
she crawls quickly towards it and stops at a kind of manhole cover with a sprung lever she wrenches the lever and pushes against it
after a little effort the cover gives way and light floods in blinding her
hanna recovers and tentatively pokes her head out into blazing sun hannas pale face appears eyes crinkled shut
wider hanna emerges from a hole in the ground in the middle of a sandblasted desert and slams the cover closed
total silence now except for the whistle of the wind on sand
it takes her eyes a moment to adjust to the blinding light
blearily she looks out across this alien environment
after a moment her ears prick up
she turns just in time to see a column of military jeeps rise over a sand dune in the distance behind her
the jeeps are crawling straight towards her ominously shimmering in the desert heat
she quickly ducks back down into her rabbit hole and waits
in the middle of the desert the soldiers convene looking for hanna
a military truck is stationery
nothing around for miles
we hear a military voice on a radio
are you receiving me
can you confirm your position
subject has escaped
the truck moves off a short distance and stops again
meanwhile a large convoy of military vehicles passes right over hanna
when it has past she sees the first vehicle crawling to a halt right near the hole just yards away
one of the military personnel in the jeep gets out and goes over to the hole lifts the lid inspects the darkness
the truck radio is on and we hear the voice
can you confirm your position
banks can you hear me
once banks is satisfied he walks away a few paces gets out a pair of high powered binoculars looks this way and that
he walks up a dune and scans the dunes with his binoculars
finally he walks back and climbs into the jeep gets on the radio
im at a perimeter opening at the far east wing
somethings not quite right
he doesnt notice but the lid is open now and the air conditioning duct is empty
as the jeep moves off we see hanna is clinging to the axle hanging upside down underneath
her face is pressed to the oily metal her back just an inch from the desert floor flashing beneath her
the jeeps now take a track along the edge of a steep dune
hanna takes her chance and lets go of her grip
she clenches her eyes shut as the jeep passes over her
as soon as the jeeps clears she rolls herself over the edge of the dune
hanna rolls down the sand dune at speed until finally she slows and stops
she lies still and shocked by the quiet as the jeep disappears into the distance
then she sits up and looks around herself
she has no conception of this landscape no idea where she might be
marissa moves between her wardrobe and a suitcase packing clothes underwear another power suit
fully packed she goes to the back of the wardrobe and pulls aside some dresses to reveal a hidden safe
she keys in the security code the safe door opens and from the back of the safe marissa retrieves a blue file
marissa looks at the files title in large blunt letters flashback to
a much younger marissa watching a very fast moving car on a deserted forest road
she takes from her pocket a small detonating device and as the car approaches a bend presses it
there is a small explosion and the car swerves off the road and smashes headlong into a post
the horn starts to blare
marissa approaches the car
the road is empty
marissa looks through binoculars at the car
she sees a woman on the passenger side head thrust forward
marissa shoots her in the head just to be sure
but the drivers seat is empty
marissa stops dead
then the back door opens on the other side
a man a younger erik heller crawls out
he is holding a two year old child in his hands
the childs coat is covered in blood
marissa stares at the shocked child and takes the rifle to her eye to shoot again
as she does erik senses her movement and throws himself to the ground
through the rifle viewfinder we see just a glimpse of erik and the red glare of the coat covered in blood erik heller grabbing the child and sprinting for the
forest marissa taking aim at heller and then firing as heller dives into the forest
marissa puts on a pair of rubber kitchen gloves and sets fire to the file in the sink
when its all burnt up she switches on the garbage disposal and pushes the ashen remains down the gurgler with a dish mop
the sun has dipped a little now the shadows of the dunes are longer but the heat is still intense
hannas throat is parched by the dry heat her pale eyes scorched by the angry sun
she walks purposefully but with a growing awareness of her tiny scale in this seemingly endless sea of sand
she has no conception of this landscape no idea where she might be
i live in leipzig
i go to school at the klaus kohle gymnasium
literature and sport
i have a dog called trudi
hanna climbs a steep dune eyes down feet pounding
a shadow falls across her path and she looks up to see the shape of a girl standing at the top of the dune silhouetted by the sun
hannas hand goes to the concealed gun
the girl stares at hanna
they must be about the same age but there the resemblance ends
hanna dusty bloodied and bruised in military top trousers and boots stares at this perfect image of western adolescence
dressed head to toe in pink and drinking a can of coke no concession to where she is whatsoever
this is sophie lyall
hanna stares at her then abruptly turns to walk in opposite direction until she sees another convoy of us military trucks in the distance
hanna turns back
looks at sophie
like a wary animal
dont you speak english
hanna is unsure how to speak to this strange person
that cant be helped
you look terrible
at that moment sophies brother miles eight years old rises over the dune and stands by sophies side
in his hand is a stills camera not digital film
miles stares at hanna while talking to sophie
i dont know
i just found her
whats her name
she cant talk
i live in leipzig
we live at number weissingerplatz
i go to school at the klaus kohle gymnasium and my best friends are rudi gunter and clara schliess
i like literature and sport in particular tennis and athletics
i also have a dog called trudi
we had a dog called vincent but he went mad and died
im sophie and this is my brother shit for brains
from over the dune comes the voice of sophie and miless mother rachel lyall
come on sophie
well miss the light
miles raises his camera to his eye and snaps a picture of bye
sophie takes one more puzzled look at hanna then turns and disappears over the sand dune
hanna rises to the top of the dune
sophie turns back to do you need a lift somewhere
i prefer to walk
sophie and miles head back towards their nouveau hippy parents rachel and sebastian lyall who are waiting for them beside an old van parked by a tarmac road that cuts
straight through the desert
marissa sitting in first class trying to hide the fact that shes on her cell phone mid flight
shes in the desert east of essouiara
have you got the dna results
we cant find them
its possible she has them on her
marissa takes that in
i want you to focus on erik heller
a sweet faced male air steward hovers over marissa
excuse madame airline regulations state that im in conference
all the same back off honey
marissas response is so fierce that the air steward instinctively does as hes told
you know this isnt going to go away
im dealing with it lewis
okay but i just want you to admit my lord how did she know to ask for you
she hangs up
hanna walking along the side of a tarmac desert road approaching a dusty oasis town
hanna enters the outskirts teaming with scooters trucks taxis mules and goats
the impact knocks hanna backwards assailed by the smells of dried fruit meat tagines couscous cooking at market stalls fresh fish and meat still bloody and twitching hanging in the
sun for the flies
she listens to the babble of arabic her ears nose and eyes sensitive to every conversation and twitch of life
it all overpoweringly exotic and visceral to her
an old broken backed woman inches her way to market
hanna stares at her in astonishment
her wrinkled skin
she eyes the abundance of animals animals shes never seen before in her life chickens
a camel which hanna finds bizarre and hilarious
hanna finds a stall with simple cotton clothing
she chooses some cheap clothes and unseen goes around the back of the stall
she changes out of her ragged old clothes into her new clothes
hanna sees miles running through the crowds carrying a bag of cherries
she follows him a little way onto a busy street with hotels and cheap jewellery stores
he runs up the steps and enters a small mid range hotel
hanna looks up at the hotel then enters
hanna stands at the reception desk
a kindly looking hotel owner is eating a jammy biscuit
hes a little confused by wheres your family
are you arab
capital city rabat
places of interest
language arabic in arabic w english i like arabic very much
its like japanese
the hotel owner nearly spits out his biscuit in shock
in arabic w english you speak arabic
in arabic w english yes of course
in arabic w english wheres your family
in arabic w english i need a room for one night
can you help
i dont have any money
the hotel owner leads hanna into a simple whitewashed hotel room with twin beds
they speak in arabic with english subtitles
its the best weve got
hanna stares at the light switch
do you have one of these in every room
all mod cons
the hotel owner looks at hanna askance
i know a little bit about electricity
they say edison discovered it or was it franklin
some american im sure
he picks up an electric kettle
electric kettle for the english they like to make their own tea
he switches it on hanna stares as it heats up noisily
he goes to a small wall mounted tv switches it on for her a fuzzy terrible picture of an arabic tv show
hanna is fascinated doesnt take her eyes off the tv as she sits on the edge of the bed
what is it
its the best we can do
she stares at the picture bemused
where do you come from
distracted hanna is caught off guard
the hotel owner smiles himself a little puzzled by this strange encounter and leaves
she just sits there staring at the tv as its volume seems to increase
meanwhile the electric kettle begins to boil
steam pours from its spout and the whole contraption starts to rattle violently
hanna gets up and approaches the kettle very warily
she tries the light switch in an attempt to stop the kettle but it keeps boiling and making its strange rattle
hanna tries another switch the ceiling fan begins to turn confusing hanna even more
on the tv the news shows footage of war in the middle east the sound of gunfire
the ceiling fan is at its top speed its blades cut the air like a helicopter
a telephone beside the bed starts to ring
combined the noises rise to a terrifying crescendo
hanna backs away towards the bathroom
she stumbles and falls through the bathroom door straight into the shower inadvertently turning the taps on
water pours down on her
hanna springs up and turns to face the stream of water as if it were an attacker
she runs back into the bedroom
in the bedroom the kettle is still having a violent tantrum the tv is still screaming the fan still cutting the phone still shouting
hanna pulls at the exit door but doesnt know to turn the handle
smashes at the door
eventually she falls through the door and into the corridor
silence as hanna sits on the corridor floor catching her breath
a little way down the corridor miles and sophie emerge from their bedroom
its that girl
he nudges sophie
hanna eyes them suspiciously
hey you made it
did you walk here
she looks different
do you want to hang with us
are you hungry
miles is always hungry
the reeperbaln the main street of hamburgs red light district
tough and unglamorous
marissa wiegler gets out of a taxi checks the sign of the strip club and crosses the road
she is on the phone and we hear
the swedish borders are sealed
i have swedish norwegian and danish border patrols on high alert and interpol have briefed the police
i dont want any bad news lewis
neither of us can afford a fuck up
marissa hangs up
she enters a converted car park which is now a lap dancing bar
its early in the day and the patrons are as scarce as the clothes on the dancers
at the far end of the room is the reason marissa is there michael isaacs
rumpled suit bleary unshaven and drinking a scotch
isaacs smiles coldly at marissa
i didnt think they let women in here
they let them in they just dont let them get dressed
he smiles drinks she eyes the scotch
still drinking on the job
you havent changed
adapt or die
you want a drink
ill wait until i really need one
he grins and drinks
she sits with a sigh looks him in the eye
erik hellers still alive
isaacs glances up from his drink
you dont say
marissa passes him a newspaper
he opens it
hidden inside is a picture of hanna
he looks it over surprised
all grown up
he did a good job
did she turn out like you hoped
she just tried to kill me
isnt it always the way
the fuck does that mean
you bring them into this world teach them how to kill and maim
and then they turn against you
i didnt teach her
no its better than that
you bred her from a test tube
marissa turns to the barman and signals for a round of the scotches atwo of these
heres the problem she thinks we killed her mother
he smiles wryly
just get her sectioned or something
sure just as soon as shes done breaking peoples necks
you get her sectioned if you can catch her
the drinks arrive marissa drinks
right now shes in morocco but shell be trying to get out of the country
find her and bring her to me
ill need funds
marissa slides an envelope of bills across the table
dont spend it all on candy
she glances meaningfully at the strippers who have been eyeing up isaacs as a potential mark
isaacs looks at the money
when he looks back up marissa is already walking out the door
hanna is sitting at a table with the family who are all eating falafel while hanna eats meat
sophie and miles parents rachel and seb have some difficulty relating to their daughters attitudes
they belong to a generation of counter cultural radicals whose priorities have over the past decade shifted and theyre now trying to assimilate into mainstream society whilst still holding on
to their ideals of autonomy and social liberation
sophie is describing a recent cultural phenomenon while she picks at her food
i wish i had a body like hers
shes really cool too
shes married to a footballer and really loves him
meanwhile hanna eyes the crowd constantly on the look out
only the papers found out he was shagging like loads of other girls so she went and got all successful in her own right and now does a make over
show where she turns right dogs into real babes
i could do you a make over if youd like
perhaps hanna doesnt want a make over sweetie
sophie ignores rachel and addresses all her responses to rachel doesnt believe in making the best of yourself
no sophie i just dont believe fourteen year old girls should be dressing to look like porn stars
it objectifies them
do you shave your armpits yet
i dont think so
keep it that way
thats sooo gross
do you often travel on your own hanna
my father encourages me to be independent
and your mother
oh im sorry
nice one dad
what did she die of
sophie is weirdly impressed
erik heller still wearing his three piece suit enters a tiny provincial swedish butchers shop and walks up to the counter
he checks around to make sure no one is following him before approaching the butcher and slapping some cash on the counter
three pounds of goose fat if you please
hanna arrives back at the hotel with rachel seb miles and sophie
miles is sleepy and sophie a little grumpy
why do we always have to get up so early
if you were a berber shepherd im not a shepherd
we have to be at the port by eight tomorrow so i want you to pack now
im too sleepy
hanna listens anxiously knowing she needs to go with them to be safe
she arrives at her door
but the family are too wrapped up in their discussion to notice her
no youre not
come on well do it together
hanna enters her room
sophie turns at the sound of hannas door closing
is it me or is that girl weird
the tv flickers illuminating hanna as she sits on her bed looking at the dna report folded up into a tight wad
she smooths it out and reads
the test reads hanna heller asgm test results
interfering sequence present
b sample confirms hanna stares at the words
ainterfering sequence present
a hanna looks at the photo of herself and those words
what does it mean
she looks up at the tv and sees footage of millions of muslim worshipers circling the kaaba at mecca
the sheer mass of humanity stuns her
hanna turns up the volume and hears the call to prayer
she listens in wonder to her first experience of music
a combination of sounds with a view to beauty of form and expression of emotion
she breathes in the beautiful sounds
the music continues over
a barren rocky outcrop on the south swedish coast
he has a rucksack on his back
heller undresses and puts his suit in a plastic bag that he knots tight
he puts the bag into the rucksack and puts it on his back
then heller starts to cover his body in the goose fat he bought in the butchers
he stares across the water towards denmark in the distance
hanna appears in the blue morning light and stalks around the car park looking for the family van
when she finds it she tries the doors but theyre locked
she tries the back door but thats also locked
she gets her foot onto a wheel and another foot onto a doorhandle and climbs up onto the roof
she studies the sun roof of the recreational vehicle
it has been left open a few inches for air
she gets her hands in there and tries to prise it open further but its mechanised and wont budge
she looks around the car park for an implement
she spies a fire escape with a caretakers nook next to it
she climbs back down off the van and goes to the caretakers room
hanna searches the tiny office until she finds a crowbar
a busy bustling ferry port cars in both directions
isaacs looks round makes silent contact with other men
four of them dotted around the ferryport
isaacs approaches a border guard
the guard is looking at a photocopied photo of hanna from her holding cell
the guard pockets the photocopy as isaacs passes him a wad of cash
the family travels towards the ferry port sleepy and grumpy yawning looking around
the sun roof to the rear above the breakfast table and bench seats is wide open
somebody broke the sun roof
i said somebody broke the sun roof
it wont close
call the rental
i hope its insured
isaacs watches closely every car that approaches the ferry from behind his dark glasses
he sees the family have joined a cue of vehicles and are having their papers checked
then theyre waved on board
he scrutinises them but has no reason to suspect anything
cars are parking their headlights on in the dark hull horns blowing ferry guards directing people to parking spaces its chaos
seb parks the van with some difficulty complaining all the while
get me back to the european union
dont be rude
they get out taking with them anything they might need knapsacks computer games suit cases
they head off towards the stairs up to the decks passing isaacs on their way
isaacs searches between the cars and trucks
he passes the back of the familys van as the camera pushes in on its back door
the handle is being jiggled from inside
inside the van is as the family left it but the bench seats around the breakfast table are disturbed
one has been opened out the lid taken off the mattress strewn on the floor inside is a big storage space where hanna has evidently hidden
the crowbar has been discarded there
hanna is trying to get out
she tries the back door but its locked
she climbs over the seats and climbs into the front cabin the drivers seat
she finds a lock on the door and unlocks
she climbs out
hanna walks out on deck and sees the sea the sight of it takes her breath away
she walks to the railings and looks over the edge
then up at the seagulls following the boat
a little way off the family are sitting eating ice creams
sophie lies out on a bench sunning herself
what has got into you
oh my god look over there
they all look where she is pointing at hanna
you think she
you dont think she
rachel the sunroof
you think we should say something
whats there to say
maybe shes in trouble
maybe shes a hooker
or a terrorist
theres a lot of them in germany
hookers or terrorists
ill go over
rachel walk away
im insisting here
im putting my foot down
rachel heads off towards hanna sophie follows
sophie and rachel approach hanna and move to positions either side of her
did you know that percent of the earths surface is covered in water
my father thinks youre a stowaway
he thinks you broke our sunroof too which puts you in deep shit
sophie just ill handle this
wheres your father
i really think it might help if you told us the you know the truth and all that
have you run away from somewhere
are you okay
im worried about you
she said shes fine
you have to understand this really is a problem for us
you know what
why dont i stay here with her and you go off and be with dad
hes looking kind of tense
rachel rejoins seb and miles
has she even got a passport
i dont think i handled that very well
how do you know shes not some kind of illegal immigrant
isaacs searches the upper deck
through the bar on the other side of the ferry he sees one of his men searching the opposite deck
a child knocks into isaacs and the few photocopied photographs he has of hanna fall from his pocket and are blown along the deck
isaacs scrambles to pick up the photocopies
hanna and sophie are still standing at the railings
sophie offers hanna some of her ice cream
would you like some
hanna looks curiously at the ice cream
she tries it
it tastes like music
youre so weird arent you
did you have a fight with your dad or something
was it bad
hanna studies the sea
can you help me get home
at that moment one of isaacs photocopied pictures of hanna rolls across the deck and catches on the railings
hanna looks down at it recognizes herself and quickly pockets it
she looks across the deck too many people she shouldnt have let herself be so exposed
you could do me a make over if you like
miles is sitting in the drivers seat pretending to drive the stationary van
through the windscreen rachel and seb can be seen having a heated discussion
in the back hanna is changing into some of sophies clothes
you know that
of course you are
youve got pretty eyes and youre tall
i always wanted to be tall
if i were a man i might fancy you
hanna responds seriously
im not a man
sophie laughs even more
the door swings open and seb is standing there with rachel nervous but determined
okay heres the deal
were going to find a way to get you home just as soon as we get off this crate
but since you dont have a passport with you right now were just going to have to be a bit gorilla
we passionately believe its the right thing to do
they dont look sure at all but sophie puts her arm round hanna and hanna returns the gesture everybody slightly embarrassed
the ferry is docked the huge doors are open and cars are starting to drive out halting on the dock to have passports checked
cars are revving up manoeuvring and getting ready to disembark
rachel is at the drivers wheel while seb is in the back stripping the cushions from the bench seats to prepare a place for hanna to hide
hanna waits breath bated her arm round sophies shoulders
on the far side she sees isaacs enter the deck
she watches him carefully and decides he must be looking for her
she ducks down a little further
rachel looking nervous turns to hanna
you okay honey
yes yes im ready
isaacs is getting closer walking between the cars
the ferry gates are open and the noise subsides
seb discovers the crowbar examines it
hanna grabs it and sticks it back in the box helps seb fling cushions aside and gets into the compartment
seb grits his teeth
here goes nothing
he shuts the bench seat over hanna and replaces the cushions just as isaacs passes the van sniffing around
seb gets out of the back and walks around to the front
he passes isaacs on his way round
isaacs gets out of the way and seb gets into the front passengers seat
rachel starts the engine checks her mirrors
seb eyes isaacs with some paranoia although he has no idea who he is
hanna lies quietly her eyes glistening in the dark
she listens hearing the van disembarking the ferry
dark rain pours down on to a beach on the danish coast
a figure struggles to land
then like a monster from the deep erik emerges out of the surf
his lungs bursting with the exertion
water dripping from his body
he collapses for a while then stumbles up the beach
he approaches the beach car park
a police car swings into the car park
erik tries to run but its too late
the police car is on him
he stops and turns towards the police car
two policemen get out of the car and approach erik
he watches them very carefully
the familys van speeds along the e up from the bay of gibraltar heading north east towards the mountains
hanna stares out at the changing light in the rugged landscape
hills are emerging and the land is turning green in the gold evening light
hanna watches rachel unscrew the cap of a water bottle and brings it to sebs mouth while he drives
seb laughs as a little water spills down his front
sophie is listening to an ipod
hanna looks at her
sophie takes one earphone out of her own ear and puts it in hannas
isaacs shows fake id to the ferrys frowning security officer who doesnt appreciate the unsolicited approach
sir ill be as brief as i can we have a situation here
isaacs is studying cc tv footage of the ferry
he views a number of scenes with no luck until he notices the car deck hanna and sophie weaving through the cars and boarding the van
hanna rests her head on sophies shoulder and relaxes for the first time
miles relaxes his head on hannas shoulder and they stare at the huge granite mountain range
she starts to nod off
she falls asleep on sophies shoulder
marissa walks along the desolate patch of coastline
she approaches a crime scene
dogs markings on the ground
two danish policemen lie inert on the pebbles their throats freshly sliced
the danish authorities are taking this very seriously
theyve doubled the number of officers on the ground
weve sent up spotter planes over the channel
theyre appealing for witnesses through the local media
marissa nods and looks out at the roiling grey sea
the reality of eriks determination unnerving her
you think he really swam it
marissa knows he did
she calls over her shoulder as she walks away
keep me posted
the campsite is heaving with humanity thousands of european campers who have turned the site into what amounts to a shanty town a small city with its own shops drainage
borders and rules
families come here from cities across europe and bring their whole lives with them
the lyall family van is squeezed in between a german family walking around in skimpy swimming costumes and a serious looking french family with quad bikes
sophie miles and hanna stare at the other families a moment
wie geht es ihnen
gutm und ihnen
jah gut gut
a french camper nods at them
hanna starts efficiently helping seb erect the childrens tent
hes watches impressed as hanna expertly ties complicated knots
rachel and miles start blowing up two inflatable mattresses
maybe we could all go for a walk when weve put the tent up
hanna looks off to the tree line
in the distance she spots a couple of rabbits in a pool of sunlight
hanna turns a display unit of postcards
through the window she can see sophie talking to two teenage one of the boys enters the shop
he looks at hanna as he passes and smiles
this is feliciano
he is handsome
hannas not used to this feeling of being looked at
while the shop assistant serves feliciano hanna pockets a postcard and a book of stamps
hanna sits on a low wall writing her postcard a mission accomplished hanna gets up and posts the card
rachel and hanna are walking in the woods together
above them the evening chorus is in full song
i just feel connected when im in the countryside
the city stifles me
hannas attention is elsewhere shes spotted something in the undergrowth
anyway i was very young when i
seb and i
he was so impressive
hanna suddenly runs into the woods
the family are sitting in fold out chairs eating charred veggie sausages
its probably just a bunch of spanish farmers mum
were hardly going to be out all night
youre not going sophie
no way jose
hanna appears from the woods carrying two skinned rabbits
she lays them in front of the family
sophie lets out a shriek of nervous laughter while seb and rachel are confused as to what the appropriate reaction might be
the girls are hiding out in the ladies room as sophie does hannas make up
i dont know why im doing this youre going to steal all the best men off of me
what do you mean
though quite frankly i dont need more digits than ive got right now
loads and loads
hanna watches herself in the mirror
mascara eye liner
she licks the lipstick puzzled
almost a woman but it doesnt look right on her
its like paint
dont lick it off
sophie finishes hannas face looks at her in the mirror
sophie and hanna sneak through the campsite together and move secretly between the parked cars
hanna is dressed in some of sophies clothes and has the make up on
they are excited sophie alive with the thrill of disobedience
i cant walk in this
you look hot
where are we going
hanna uncomfortable with the situation
i shouldnt take unnecessary risks
sophie heads off down the road
hanna weighs the situation and then quickens her pace to catch up with sophie
a loud out door rave in a roman amphitheatre
sophie and hanna stand at the top of the amphitheatre looking down on the thrilling spectacle soaking up the bass the abstract sounds the sheer volume the pulsing lights and
electric atmosphere hanna is thrilled and startled
many of the crowd seem to be wearing fancy dress
hanna stares at a girl dressed as a red ladybird
the girls approach a bar and sophie goes to order
shes forced to mime and shout her order over the music
the bartender shakes his head and holds up two bottles of water
meanwhile hanna spots feliciano the handsome spanish boy from the camp site shop across the dance floor
he is staring at her again
sophie comes back with two bottles of water and hands one to what do they call this music
hanna stares at the dancers people losing themselves in it sophie just grins starts to move to the music
hanna smiles awkwardly tries to copy sophie
isaacs enters the rave followed by two of his henchmen
they split up and start to survey the crowd
over in a secluded corner isaacs sees a drug deal taking place
isaacs sidles over to the dealer and his punter
the punter thinking isaacs is probably a cop makes a hasty getaway
what you got
in spanish w english nothing man
that guys just a friend
isaacs frisks the dealer nothing
he turns the dealer against the wall and checks his socks where he finds a stash of tiny baggies each containing a gram or two of white powder
isaacs samples the powder and pockets the lot
in spanish w english hey youre not police
what the fuck
isaacs turns as he walks away and puts a finger to his lips
back near the bar hanna and sophie are approached by a couple of scrawny spanish boys in day glow tops
in spanish w english where are you from
the girls just look at each other
you like to party
they watch puzzled as sophie smiles disinterestedly and leads hanna away
will you teach me to do dancing
hanna and sophie walk onto the dance floor and begin to dance
hanna starts by dancing like a five year old swinging her arms jerkily and lifting her feet as if walking through a field
but soon her movements become more sophisticated and expressive
isaacs is searching through the crowd
he eyes the bodies around him greedily
he takes another dab of the white powder and rubs it into his gums
back on the dance floor hanna and sophie are dancing
feliciano approaches through the crowd followed by a friend
they start to circle hanna and sophie dancing insinuating their way in
hes after you
how can you tell
duh look at the way hes looking at you
felicianos friend approaches sophie hes not bad looking either
whats your name
have you come here before
all the time
you dance well
so do you
hanna and feliciano hold eye contact
the music rises and now theyre lit only by the intermittent flashes of a strobe light
hanna and feliciano begin to dance around each other their movements caught in still flashes
from some distance away isaacs spots hanna
he smiles and starts to move through the crowds towards her
sophie and the friend are kissing
hanna sees this and laughs
the crowd is jumping
hanna feels felicianos hand take hers she flinches a moment then lets him draw her towards him
their eyes still locked
isaacs is getting closer his eyes flashing eerily in the strobe lighting
hanna and feliciano are in a world of their own
his fingers trace the lines of her arms shoulders and neck
he draws her face towards his
are we going to kiss now
would you like to
kissing requires a total of thirty four facial muscles
their lips are almost touching
the most important muscle involved is the orbicularis oris muscle which is used to pucker the lips he kisses her
hanna closes her eyes
isaacs moves in
feliciano becomes more ardent puts his arms around her waist she doesnt like it
he tries to open her mouth with his
in a few swift moves hanna pulls feliciano round and throws him to the ground
she falls to his side and with one knee on his back she holds his head about to snap his neck
sophie turns and sees them on the ground
a few of the closest dancers also stop dancing and stare
isaacs backs off watching from a safe distance
please dont hurt me
please tell your friend
hanna looks up at sophie
now that she has feliciano on the ground she doesnt know what to do with him
should i let him go
as opposed to what
yes you should let him go
hanna leans in to whisper into felicianos ear
im going to go now
it was nice
and shes gone pulling sophie away through the crowd
isaacs jumps into action
but hes lost sight of the girls among the mass of dancing bodies
hanna and sophie move quickly through the crowds towards the exit
oh my god hanna
i thought you were going to kill him
where dyou learn to do that
my father taught me
they escape through a hole in the perimeter fence
an immaculately tidy lounge in a small apartment on the ground floor of a run down east berlin housing project
a well dressed woman in her s katrin is sitting alone listening to music on an old casette machine
the door buzzer rings
katrin gets up slowly and approaches the door
who is it
katrin puts the safety chain across the door and opens it a small amount
katrin slams the door shut in fright and double locks it
fear racing through her veins she rushes her way through the lounge knocking furniture as she goes
katrin races to the kitchen door and bolts it
thinking the apartment is secure she tries to catch her breath
but slowly she becomes aware of someone elses presence in the room
she turns to face the intruder
marissa standing waiting patiently
you look different in pictures
well here i am in the flesh
katrins mouth twitches with all the imagined conversations shes had with marissa
has erik heller contacted you
marissa sits calmly in an old arm chair
huh if only
if hes alive why would he contact me
that depends on whether you believe hes innocent or not
im an old woman with a broken whats in the past stays in the past right
something like that
so why all the years of snooping around and sticking your nose in
youd understand if you had kids
she turns her back on marissa
kids they fuck you up dont they
marissa stands up puts a mm to the back katrins head and pulls the trigger
katrin drops to the floor revealing a framed blood splattered photograph of katrin zadeks daughter joanna
hanna and sophie lie next to each other in sleeping bags with a torch between them
cant you sleep
looks at her
where do you really come from
leipzig i live in leipzig sophie looses her patience
if were going to be friends you have to be honest with me
thems the rules
hanna is taken aback
are we friends
i like you
id like to have a friend
i mean youre a freak and everything but i like you
i like you too
i really do
but there are things i cant tell you
do you understand
actually no i dont
there are people that want to harm me
and they wont stop
so for your own safety
hanna looks into sophies eyes
can we still be friends
i dont know
i mean i dont really know who you are
thats just it
neither do i
she reaches into her bag
brings out the dna report
shows it to sophie
what is it
i think its about me
dna is kind of how were made i think
i mean who we are
they look at it
what will you do
im going to berlin
i have to meet my father at the house of wilhelm grimm
as in agrimms fairytalesa
sophie sighs at hanna
if you say so
did i say the wrong thing again
sophie looks at hanna sees shes vulnerable
she takes a bracelet off her own wrist
gives it to her
to remember me
hanna takes it puts it on
looks at sophie
its a friendship bracelet
hanna stares at the ceiling looks over at sophie whos starting to sleep
hanna reaches out and touches her hair
beside them separated by a thin piece of fabric we see that miles has woken and has been listening in the darkness
marissa is searching the apartment
shes thorough and fast
she rips cushions and throws books from their shelves
her actions become progressively more frantic relishing the destruction
she finds more and more photographs of joanna
the photographs seem to have a driving effect on her
she walks down the hall and opens a door onto a small spare bedroom that had been turned into home office
every available wall space is covered in newspaper clippings and photographs relating joannas murder
on the floor marissa finds a box of old casette tapes
she stops to inspect one of the tapes
a label reads a joanna no
erik heller walks into a small long established family hotel on a danish road near the coast
he is in the slightly dated suit he wore when he left the forest and looks a little dishevelled and odd
a sixtyish danish woman stands behind the counter scrutinising him
they speak in danish with english subtitles
i need a room
yes of course
i stayed here fifteen years ago
it hasnt changed
we dont much like change here
neither do i
you have some post
she turns and retrieves hannas postcard from the mail rack and hands it to him
erik reads amission accomplisheda have you heard about the manhunt
a man has killed two coastguards
everybody is being asked to keep an eye out
for what exactly
i dont know
she takes a closer look and notices goose fat smeared behind his ear
and blood on a shirt cuff
the family have checked out and are leaving the campsite
how long until you drop me off
we should have you there by dinner time
from lille you can get a train to berlin
leipzigs just a few hours further
hanna and sophie exchange a look
the family van passes through the campsite gates to reveal isaacs coming out of the reception hut
he sees the van recognises it
he sees the kids in the back
he runs to a black bmw where two of his henchmen are waiting for him
he jumps in the passenger seat whilst the driver revs the engine
the bmw pulls out in front of an oncoming truck narrowly avoiding a collision
isaacs holds onto the dash
keep your distance
the receptionist picks up the phone and dials
is that the police
yes i dont want to trouble you but i have a new guest you may wish to know about
a commuter train pulls into the vast station
amongst the morning commuters alighting the train is erik heller
he looks furtively around and tries to blend in with the crowd
pov from a walkway above the station someone is watching heller as he tries to conceal himself within the throng
a danish agent hidden on a metal walkway above the platform
on the platform heller walks amongst the commuters past the ticket collectors past another danish agent posing as a commuter he stops and lingers by him noting something not right
he moves off and enters a small bar
the second agent immediately follows and from the walkway the other rushes downstairs to give chase too
heller walks through the bar into the toilets finds a fire exit and walks out through it
heller finds himself in a goods yard adjoining the train station
he walks through the goods yard then suddenly and apparently for no reason stops dead then throws himself behind a skip of empty bottles
as he does two new men american special ops run round the corner into the goods yard
from the fire exit the danish agents emerge and after signalling to each other head off to the perimeter
the various agents scour the yard
the special ops get closer to hellers hiding place
heller suddenly emerges from his hiding place and sticks an elbow in the face of one a knee in the groin of another
theres a brief exchange of blows
one of the special ops draws his hand gun
heller produces a knife out of nowhere and launches at the man cutting him on the hand making him drop his gun
he stabs the other in the eye and the man falls to the ground squealing
heller leans in and takes from the mans pocket his heller makes a run for it
one of the special ops lets off a shot the bullet clipping heller in the leg
he falters but limps off behind the towering containers
the family van is making its way up through france
following in the black bmw a few cars behind isaacs and his henchmen are biding their time
rachel is driving while hanna rides in the front seat keeping her entertained
they can live at freezing temperatures for up to nine months without food
imagine that nine months
why do you know so much about fleas
i read it in my encyclopaedia
hanna is looking in the side view mirror
she sees isaacs bmw and frowns shes seen it before
also they can jump around times their own body length which makes them the best jumpers of all known animals except for the froghopper
now they can really jump
rachel makes a turn and hanna checks the side view mirror again
yes the bmw is still there
hanna becomes anxious
everything all right
i think so
but hannas face betrays her concern
mama i know youre disappointed in me i know it
im so sorry mama
but i have found maybe a way to make it better
close on a portable casette machine playing one of the tapes marissa discovered at katrin zadeks
im in a program now
a program to make babies stronger
in an adjoining bathroom marissa in a pair of cotton pyjamas is brushing her teeth
her lips pulled back in a snarl
an american program
its very scientific
important scientific work
still brushing marissa walks through to the tape machine and presses fast forward
then play erik says he can get these tapes to bastard
he says i look beautiful
i dont feel beautiful
marissa doesnt care fast forwards
play im not sure if its true that the baby can hear but at night i sing
i hope it hears me
marissa listens for some unknown reason to marissa this catches her imagination
the phone rings
frau wiegler this is reception
i have one erik heller for you
marissa stops dead
put him on
you were supposed to be dead
so were you
a phone booth in a city park
erik shivering in the cold as icy rain falls around him hes holding the cellphone he stole from the dead special ops
hellers leg is bleeding profusely
well here we are
how did you know i was here
i killed one of your men
got his cellphone
youve gotten soft
no i just grew up
the worlds changed since you died
you got kids
marissa stops taken aback by the question
no i made choices
hannas practically yours you know
this goes straight to an ache thats been building in not interested
but she is
shes true and good and funny
yeah shes funny
you should see her
im looking forward to it
youll have to catch her first
the line goes dead
marissa puts the phone down and sits quietly for a moment
then presses play again on the tape machine
was it like this for you mama
i think i know what the baby looks like
i think its a girl i hope so
the familys van drives behind isaacs bmw tails it lights on high beam
i wonder who shell be
i hope shes smart
i hope shes a stronger person than i am
hanna sits beside her in the passenger seat her anxiety growing
rachel is still at the wheel watching the bright headlights behind
shit shit shit
i think were lost hanna
hanna checks the side view mirror again and sees isaacs bmw
shes knows that whoever is driving that car is after her
she looks back and sees seb sophie and miles all comfortably asleep
miles fingers wrapped around a transformers toy
im going to pull over
i need to check the map
the van slowly pulls in at the side of the road
rachel waits for the bmw behind to pass but instead it pulls in behind the van
on either side of the road is an enormous container park
the containers are piled on top of each other like a giant babys building blocks
why wont that car pass
he has his lights on high beam i was doing everything i could to get out of the way
sophie wakes up in the back
are we stopped
i need to pee
well i dont want you going too far right now
i think you should stay where you are sophie
hanna doesnt take her eyes off the mirror
she can see the silhouettes of isaacs and his men
they dont move and neither does hanna
both are waiting for the other to make the first move
hanna whats going on
seb wake up
this is creepy
youre creeping me out
are we in lille
but you really mustnt get out of the van
hanna climbs into the back of the van and comes very close to what ever you do dont follow me
promise not to follow me
hanna tell me whats going on or seb will go over to that car and find out
like fuck i will
everyone stay put
wheres my phone
thank you for being my friend
hanna looks back at the bmw
all at once all four of the car doors open
in a flash hanna pulls open the vans side door and bolts from the van
rachel sees isaacs and one of the henchmen chase after hanna
the second henchman appears at her drivers window aiming his gun at her head
hanna sprints across hard tarmac heading for the relative safety of the container park
isaacs and his henchman follow at speed
hanna enters a dark gully between two enormous containers
isaacs slips around the other side to block her off
he signals to the henchman to loop around and flank hanna
hanna moves quietly between the containers turning this way and that
isaacs voice comes echoing through the maze
dont be a silly girl hanna
you need to come with me now
i know where your papa is
isaacs his gun in hand calls out again
he wants to talk to you hanna
he misses you
the henchman appears directly behind hanna
hanna double kicks him in the chest
hanna pulls herself up the side of the containers and scrambles on top of them and runs jumping between the containers when she reaches a gap
the henchman appears having climbed up too
a chase ensues
hanna followed by the henchman climbing up higher now four containers high
isaacs follow below
hanna jumps an enormous gap between two containers and right over the head of isaacs
hanna slips and tumbles but catches the edge of one of the containers on her way down
she hangs there a moment then pushes herself off the side of the container and manages to land on a lower container on the other side
hanna running across the tops of the containers sees the henchman appear at the far edge
she grabs a discarded wrench and throws it at the man catching him in the side of the head a perfect aim and he tumbles to the ground
she descends the containers with nimble leaps and comes to the ground
shes running now through a maze of tight alleys between the containers
she stops at a a t junction unsure which way to go
suddenly isaacs appears at the end of one alley henchman one at the end of another and henchman two at the end of the third
just take it easy
hanna makes her decision and runs straight at isaacs
he stretches out his arms in an attempt to catch her
she hits him like a bowling ball hitting the last pin and he crashes to the ground
she rolls and springs to her feet
the henchmen follow but hanna is too quick
hanna sprints full tilt out of the container park and through a scrap metal yard
either side of her rise mountains of waste
hanna reaches the edge of an industrial canal from where the scrap metal is unloaded
a large industrial barge is passing beneath
hanna jumps and lands on the moving barge
then quickly takes cover under a tarpaulin
four holding cells in a row each one holding a member of the family
seb paces around his cell
rachel sits stoically in hers
sophie is crying in her cell while miles is playing with his nintendo in his cell
marissa walks into sophies cell
would you please stop crying
im not telling you anything
honey your friend is in a lot of danger
you need to help us find her
i dont know where to find her
marissa grits her teeth shows sophie a photo of feliciano
do you know him
he knows you
marissa now in rachels cell
we gave her a ride because we thought she was in trouble
but you knew she didnt have a passport
you smuggled her into port and helped her illegally gain she said she lived in leipzig
she went to the klaus kohle gymnasium
there is no klaus kohle gymnasium
it closed five years ago
shock on rachels face
did she give any idea of where she was going
rachel wracks her brains
she said she was going home to leipzig
she seemed lost
like she needed taking care of
woman to woman you understand
marissa shows her the photograph of joanna zadek
this was hannas mother joanna zadek
fifteen years ago hannas father shot her to death on a camping holiday by the baltic
rachel swallows goes pale
marissa now in sebs cell
she was odd
ill give you that
i mean i get on with most kids you know have a rapport
but this one you know mr lyall its days like these that i really hate my job
im sure you do
its a very very difficult thing to do
but sometimes children are bad people too
marissa in miless cell
miles is terrified of marissa
she puts her hand out and strokes his hair
im not going to hurt you
miles shrinks from her touch
miles is a nice name
are you a nice boy
she strokes miles hair and immediately he starts crying loudly
seb pounds on the wall from his cell
hey whats going on in there
we dont have to put up with this
were in the eu goddammit
hanna watches as the sun rises over the misty fields either side be the canal
its a beautiful sight
hanna is strangely peaceful
now the whole family are reunited in miles cell
he sniffs and plays with his nintendo
the others look wan as marissa passes around a photo of the two dead danish policemen
the family go silent
three days ago hannas father killed two danish policemen on a beach with a hunting knife
where is he now
hes still at large and hes still very dangerous
we need to find hanna before he does
sophie thinks about it but clams up
if you know anything at all its vital you tell us for her own safety
we are now very worried about her
but sophie doesnt say a word
they all look at her
miles suddenly speaks
shes going to berlin
to wilhelm grimms house
you little bastard
how did you know that
sophie slaps miles over the back of the head but seb pushes her back
hey hey hey
sophie for gods sake
hannas sits on the prow of the barge as it makes its slow progress into berlin
marissa looks out at a school playground as she waits in the back of her car
the passenger door next to her opens and isaacs gets in
ive looked through hellers contacts from the s
theres no one called wilhelm
wilhelm grimm wrote fairy tales
he died two hundred years ago
marissa hands isaacs a brown envelope containing one of the photographs she took from katrins apartment
the photograph shows a happy looking joanna and erik at a busy family amusement park
between erik and joanna is a clown his arms around both of them
this we will come to understand is klaus knepfler
behind them is a grimms
what the hell is this
marissa smiles slightly
to the driver drive on
hanna wanders through the skyscrapers and glass constructions of berlin
people swarm around her but pay her no mind
hanna is riding a tram to the outskirts of town
hanna walks beside a wire mesh fence that separates her from an abandoned amusement park
behind her is an enormous steel works from which great industrial plumes of steam rise
hanna climbs under the fence and walks through this surreal playground long since reclaimed by nature
there are huge fibreglass dinosaurs toppled over with heads missing and abandoned dinosaur legs
rising above the park surrounded by a muddy moat is the big wheel now standing at a vertiginous angle
in front of the big wheel is the wilhelm grimm house
the house is a grimm brothers fairytale theme a fun house
its windows long since shuttered vines growing through its roof
hanna stands in front of the house in deep anticipation
she walks up the small steps that lead to the front door and knocks
she waits heart sinking at the thought of there being no one home
then ever so slightly the door opens and peering out at her is a man with the sad face of an out of work clown
excuse me young lady
it is the man from the photo but twenty years older
small with a wiry intensity
are you wilhelm grimm
not exactly but itll do for now
come this way
he leads her inside
they come inside its old and full of hoarded junk antiques boxes books dusty china lamps figurines but still functional an old mans home
he stops to look at her
so you are hanna
he puts out his hand to shake
its very nice to meet you hanna
hanna smiles and shakes his hand she likes him already
knepfler studies her quietly moved by his memories
my real name is knepfler
im an old friend of your fathers
i am a sort of acaretakera here
what happened to it
no car park
you need a car park these days otherwise people wont come
but somebody has to watch over it
i like it too
erik used to come here a great deal
have you heard from him
you must wait
he will be here soon
hanna stares not quite believing
hanna stares out the window thinking all this through
knepfler leads hanna through a reception area and under a spider with a human face that straddles a door to a run down kitchen
hanna follows knepfler into the kitchen
please sit down
hanna sits at the old kitchen table on a wooden bench while knepfler goes to the stove
would you like an egg
hanna takes an egg breaks it and swallows it raw
he gives her a buff envelope
she looks inside some money a passport id cards
youll need a fresh photograph
dont get it wet
hanna looks at the passport with a new name anna marie elkan
she takes a deep breath not really comprehending
i dont really understand
it tells people who you are
she stares at the passport with the blank space for her photo
there is an apartment ready for you in the south
erik will come and the car will take you there today
you will live there now
do i have to
dont you want to
i dont know
i miss the forest
i miss my home
thats to be expected
but the city is so exciting dont you think
she drinks her water thinking
did you know my mother
what was she like
she was very gentle she was very funny very talented a singer did you know that
she had your eyes
he smiles at her
she heres a noise outside and runs to look out the window
she sees isaacs bmw pull up outside the house followed by a second car
knepfler leads hanna out of the kitchen
the driver of the second car gets out and opens the back door for marissa
she gets out and looks up at the house
knepfler points hanna towards a set of stairs that lead up from the reception
theres a knock at the door
hanna begins to climb the stairs while knepfler approaches the front door
theres another knock at the door
hanna enters a room thats been designed to look like grandmas bedroom from little red riding hood
hanna hurriedly slides under the bed
breathing as quietly as she can
she can hear the sound of isaacs men starting to spread through the house
listen to me listen
there is no one here
there is nobody up there
check the attic
footsteps to the attic
marissa has knepfler cornered on the stairs
do you know him
i have never heard of him
marissa shows him the photograph of joanna erik and knepfler outside the house
i dont know these people
think very carefully he shrugs and marissa grabs knepfler by the throat
he speaks in gasps
he called me
shes coming soon
to meet him
marissa lets him go
she turns to isaacs
take him in there
find out what he knows
the sound of knepfler being escorted into a next door room the door shutting
the sound of footsteps coming into the room
hanna silent under the bed
marissas green shoes are in sight nothing else
the green shoes come close and hanna feels the mattress compress as marissa sits on the bed
she looks at the shoes as she hears her call
hanna hears the name
the name of the woman she thought she had killed
her face pale in shock and fear
you got anything
hes coming here
i can smell it
double the men
but lewis i want to talk to him
hanna hears marissa hang
another pair of shoes enter the room
his names klaus knepfler
he used to send hellers things from berlin before the communists were kicked out of prague
how much does he know about the programme
he knew johanna
what does he know about the child
he also thinks eriks the father
well thats good
everybody thinks eriks her father
erik probably thinks hes her father
hannas eyes widen in shock
she can barely control her breath
you got a fix on him yet
lets see what else knepfler has to offer
he leaves her
marissa suddenly senses something
did she hear an intake of breath
she turns and quickly looks under the bed
no one there
her imagination maybe
marissa stands and we see the shoes walk away to the door
they reach the door
hanna clinging to the bedsprings in mid air not breathing
the green shoes leave
hurriedly she climbs out from under the bed and goes to a window
hanna lands having jumped from the window
she looks around quickly
then out of sight from the cars at the front of the house she runs for dear life
hanna walking fast in total shock and confusion
who is she
she walks head down determined not to be seen
not knowing where she is going
her world turned upside down
she sees an internet cafe
ducks into it
hanna sits down at a computer
the young owner comes up to her
you have to pay first
euros for half an hour
she looks at the money that knepfler gave her
it contains euros
she hands some over to the owner
how does it work
youve never used the internet
he smiles in amazement and logs on for her
the owner brings up a search engine
just type whatever it is youre looking for here
he walks away and hanna slowly starts to type
she types in erik heller limps head bowed through the amusement park
he suddenly stops dead and ducks behind a fallen fibreglass dinosaur as he sees two cia agents sitting in a car outside the house
heller watches for a moment or two
then keeping low he makes a painful run towards the house
heller throws himself against the back wall of the kitchen
he breathes heavily for a moment clutching his wounded leg
he turns and rises to look through the kitchen window
inside he sees knepfler stripped to the waist his body bloodied hanging upside down from a meat hook
hes obviously dead
heller crouches back down against the wall thinking furiously
then decision made he checks sight lines and runs back across the amusement park away from the house
hanna sits at the computer looking at the screen breathless with tension
phrases from the text leap out at her
aan interfering sequence within the dnaa aintervention to the mothers uterus during pregnancy
a hanna stands in shock
she reads again
aintervention to the mothers uterusa hanna deletes the page
sits in shock
then writes in her mothers name
immediately the article about johannas death comes up
hanna stares at it
she reads it
no mention of a child
there is an address for johanna zadek
she came from the heizinger buildings area in the suburbs of east berlin
hanna writes it down
gets up and leaves
hanna sits in the back of a taxi as it takes her into a grim concrete jungle of old east german housing projects
hanna looks at the thousands of tiny windows so many lives being lived in unawareness
is this normality
is this the world she longed to be a part of
marissa and isaacs wait in grandmas room
isaacs phone rings
puts the phone down
a public computer at a berlin internet cafe just did a web search for adna interfering sequencea
next they searched the name johanna zadek
marissa stops dead
looks at isaacs
shes not coming here
hanna gets out of the taxi and looks up at an enormous grey housing block the heizinger building
she approaches the entrance and looks on all the buzzers
sees a name scrawled on one number
she presses the buzzer
a gang of kurdish youths come out the block and hanna catches the door and enters
hanna knocks at the door of number waits knocks again louder
a door further along opens
kurdish music pours out
a kurdish woman wrapped in shawls emerges pushing a pram
shes followed by her two other children
in german w english excuse me
im looking for joanna zadeks house
can you help
the kurdish woman wont look hanna in the eye as she passes
she mutters her response
in kurdish w english i dont speak german
hanna kicks at the door but knows it wont be answered so doesnt wait
hanna walks round to the back door of the apartment and approaches the kitchen window
she peers through
on first inspection the kitchen seems undisturbed
then hanna sees the framed photograph of joanna on the wall
blood splattered across the glass
hanna quickly moves to the door tries to force it
she looks around no ones coming
with a sharp kick she smashes the glass
hanna climbs through the broken glass into the kitchen
the air is thick with the buzz of bluebottle flies
hanna sees the photograph of joanna
with some trepidation she moves round the kitchen table and sees the body of katrin zadek
the back of katrins head is blown clean away
the flies have laid their eggs in the bloody mess of her brain that spreads across the cheap lino floor
hanna steps back and gags
she backs out of the kitchen and into the hall
turns and goes through into the lounge
the lounge has been over thrown
cushions ripped shelving pulled down
hanna stares at the destruction wrought by marissas hunt for information
hanna turns walks back down the hall and passes a door to a tiny second bedroom
she stops and enters
the room had been turned into a home office there are newspaper clippings relating to joannas murder and photographs of joanna herself covering every available wall space
a testament to katrins unremitting search for the truth behind her daughters murder
hanna begins to search the room for clues
anything that will help her understand who she is and where she came from
then suddenly she hears a quiet familiar voice
you wont find anything
hanna turns in shock
marissa would have been much too careful for that
hanna stares at him
sit down hanna
are you my father
are you my father
moment of electric silence between them
erik does nothing but she knows the answer is no
i was going to tell you
hanna sinks to the floor
whats wrong with me
erik flinches slightly
where was i born
erik knows he has to tell the truth
it was a secret cia research programme in rural poland
what kind of research
hanna stares at erik
it was run by marissa wiegler
the science came from the old east germany
the money from the cia
the intention was to explore whether small genetic changes could be made to embryos
erik looks at her
she looks so young so numb so lost
reduce capacity for fear
increase muscle strength
anything that might make a better soldier
hanna looks up stares at him
its her hes talking about
how did you know about it
eriks stares right at her
i worked for it
she stares at him
he hands her a piece of paper from his pocket
this is what you were looking for
it is an invitation to johanna zadek to participate in the galinka project
a projected date of arrival at the galinka centre
a date rd february
an agreed fee to be paid to johanna
five hundred american dollars
an agreement to give up the child and have no legal claim over it
the letter is signed by erik heller
i recruited your mother at an abortion clinic in may
she was about to terminate an unwanted pregnancy
some boy at a disco
hanna looks at the paper in shock
i had recruited twenty women
she was the last
she was different
two years later i heard the programme was to be terminated
the research adisposed ofa
i tried to save all of you
but you were the only one i was able to rescue
hanna stands in shock
she reaches to the window of the room to get some air
she is reeling faint
hanna listen to me
keep away from me
erik approaches her
with real conviction
you mean im a killer
he makes to touch her
hanna springs back in violent repulsion
dont touch me
we have a new identity for you
a new life
a new beginning
she stares at him then pushes past him
erik stops pushes her back but then hanna grabs a sharp letter opener
she attacks erik pushes her to one side grabs her
a fight in the apartment
chaos photos of johanna crashing lamps and bookshelves falling
hanna murderous erik just defending himself not willing to hurt her
but then she overpowers him has a knife to his throat
let me go
he releases her
she goes to the door
i tried to prepare you for what your life would be
you didnt prepare me for this
and her look is so full of pain that in that moment erik knows he has done a terrible wrong
she starts to leave down the fire escape
erik calls after her
he looks out to watch her go
its then erik sees the cars coming across the estate scrubland
erik turns in panic
and dashes back into the apartment runs through the destroyed living room and out through the front door
erik comes out of the main entrance and runs into full view of the cars deliberately distracting them from hanna
marissas car is a about to turn the corner and bump straight into hanna when suddenly
marissa sees erik leaving the front of the apartment block
she speaks to isaacs
and the car swerves to follow him
thus moving unknowingly away from the slight figure of hanna
hanna can see the cars in full chase of erik heller
he has distracted them
heller sprints fast across the wasteland
he dives down a side alley losing his pursuers for a second
takes out a gun looking for marissa
looking to finish it off
just as he has done this isaacs henchman approach from the end of the street
heller fires in their direction starts to run down an alley
he vaults a dividing wall scratching himself on barbed wire
he sprints round a corner and sees a doorway ahead of him
he walks towards the doorway
marissa steps out of the doorway her gun trained on him
there are men at the end of the alleyway
heller drops his gun
silence between them
he turns to look her in the eye
so go ahead
she stares at him
wants to make this as painful as she can for him
you know ill find her
dont under estimate what you created
what we created together
hanna is walking fast across the grim grey estate to a main road
marissa with her gun still at erik
truth is i was always very fond of you
close on hanna continuing to walk away
she hears a single gun shot
knows what it means
an intense conflict of emotions inside her
her breathing stops for a moment her world seems to go silent
then a car flies by on the main road almost running her over and she is woken
she sees a bus stop ahead
on auto pilot she runs to it a bus coming she beckons
it stops and she is on board
marissa stands over the dead body of erik heller
leave him here
and they all walk away leaving him alone in the east berlin dirt
hanna on the bus
shaking from the shock of his death bloodied slightly from the fight
the other passengers stare at her as she forces back the tears
hanna reaches in her pocket for a handkerchief but only pulls out the letter erik showed her
the galinka letter
she sees the address
galinka ostrovska district poland
hanna makes a decision
she is going back to where she was born
she must find out who she is
marissa enters the apartment
and looks at the chaos
isaacs comes up behind her
henchmen at the door
they had a fight
she must know the truth
where do you think shes gone
where would you go
marissa turns to isaacs
im closing the cia operation down
heller is dead thats all that matters to them
this we do alone
hannas head rests on the backrest of a train seat as the train crawls through the polish german border
exhausted many nights without sleep
hungry but unable to eat
in the same carriage a polish woman sleeps alongside her child of two also sleeping
hanna looks at the child
the peace of the innocent
the train entering a polish train station
the town is called ostrovska
the town is in the north of poland and its very poor
hanna exits approaches a station guard
i am looking for a train to galinka
galinka is a small village
you must wait for bus in the morning
where can i stay
hanna sees the hotel
hanna enters the tiny dank hotel room
she looks at the filthy carpet the grey ceiling
she turns on the tiny tv
tom and jerry type stuff
but she doesnt laugh
she flicks channel
then stands dead still
she is looking at erik hellers dead body on the ground
the report depicts him as a dangerous criminal
hanna stares at the image
the death of the man she spent her life with
hannas face oddly still in the tv flicker
then she flicks it off
leaves the room
hanna exhausted sleepless and starving comes down the shabby hotel stairs and enters the hotel bar
empty room old carpet bad smell dated pop music
three hard drinking men stare at her making her uncomfortable as she goes to the bar
a forty five year old businessman stands there drinking
do you have a sandwich
kitchen is closed
the businessman speaks in german
get her something
poor girls hungry
the barman disappears
hanna looks round waits
im from leipzig
hanna flinches at the name
he looks at her body
hanna senses it
her sandwich arrives
she leaves it walks out
where are you going
i am tired
i need to sleep
she leaves the bar
hanna walks back up the stairs
she walks along the corridor gets to her room
i was just making nice conversation
as she enters her room he puts his foot in the door
maybe we can do business
hanna kicks his foot out of the door
you dont like talk huh
he barges into the room and grabs her
tries to push her on to the bed
he is strong
his words and tone contrasting violently with his actions
be a nice little dolly
hanna is thrust on to the bed but suddenly turns him over her head and smashes him against a cupboard
businessman grabs her hair and throws her on the bed
but now hanna snaps
she starts to roar
its like an animal like nothing we have seen before
she rips at his face grabs a glass smashes it and cuts his face with it
pure animal rage
businessman starts to scream blood pouring from his eyes
he collapses on the floor
she kicks him punches him repeatedly in a grief fuelled rage until she is spent of her primal fury and falls panting to the floor
when she looks up she sees his mangled bloody body lying next to her
not quite dead
hanna suddenly recoils in horror
shocked by the viciousness of her actions
tears begins to run down her cheeks as hanna grabs the mans wallet and leaves the room
shaking in shock hannah walks out of the hotel and down the street in a daze no idea where she is going
she starts to run faster and faster just running to run out of herself
finally she stops and is sick
she looks up
a taxis yellow light blinks in the darkness
she looks at the businessmans wallet to see how much money is in there
she approaches the taxi
i have this much
can you take me to galinka
hanna is in the taxi as it travels a lonely polish forest road through undulating snow covered hills
cold dawn is arriving
grey skies lightening through the windscreen
tall snowy pines tower above the car
no one else on the road just a horse drawn cart guiding cows to pasture
it is as if from a different age
hanna checks the paper in her pocket
blood on her hands from the businessman
a cut in her arm
carefully secretly she wipes it clean
suddenly the taxi stops
this is as far as the money gets you
hanna looks out
middle of nowhere
how much further
but no smile from him nothing
hanna gets out
starts to walk as the taxi turns and drives back the way it came
she is alone in the forest freezing shattered hungry
just about dawn
cold as hell
she hears a car approach
tries to hail it but it flies past fast
blows icy air in her face
she continues in the freezing cold sees the road ahead
its hilly winding she isnt going to make it
still she walks
dead on her feet
gathering every ounce of energy
then the sounds of another car
but it too just flies by ignoring her waves and cries
hanna almost collapses in frustration
but carries on
carries on walking
hanna alone on the road
can she make it
then another car
hanna turns waves cries out
and almost magically the car slows and stops
the window winds down
im going to galinka
can you help me
a womans voice german in german
yes i can take you there
and as hanna gets in she looks at the comforting smiling face of marissa wiegler
marissa starts to drive hanna sits in the front with her
hanna has no idea who she is
marissa speaks in perfect german
calm soft comforting
its a very dull place galinka
why would you want to go there
i was born there
but ive never really seen it
why are you going
i have some business to sort out
she looks at her and smiles a sunny uncomplicated smile
its very lucky we ran into each other dont you think
youve hurt your arm
marissa hands her some tissue
hanna bandages the arm
youre not german
are you american
i lived there for many years
i travel a lot
marissa smiles at her kindly
hanna feels safe for the first time in ages
she feels the tears come
oh dear whats wrong with you
are you in trouble
she fights the tears
marissa gently holds her hand as she drives
what sort of trouble
though her tears i dont know what to do
nothing is what i thought it would be
ugly and cruel and i dont know where to go or
i dont know what i expected
marissa secretly genuinely affected by this
fights the emotion that has surprised her
sometimes i feel the same way
hanna eyes her surprised to hear this from a grown up woman
marissa puts on some music
i like music
sleep why dont you
you look very tired
it will take half an hour on this road
she begins to drift off so long since she has slept
her eyes fall shut and her head rests against the window
she is asleep
soft dawn light as marissa drives on a narrow rural road
marissa looks at the sleeping hanna
marissa represses her gathering emotion
hanna suddenly looking so young as she sleeps the sleep of the innocent
the rush of emotion shocks her she is watching hanna not the road and she veers off nearly crashing the car narrowly avoiding a tree
she puts her foot sharply on the brake
shes wearing the same green shoes as she wore at wilhelms house
hanna is jolted awake
where are we
marissa calms herself instantly
hanna doesnt see marissas shoes
marissas car slows as it enters a tiny deserted hamlet
this is it
hanna looks around
there is not much to galinka
she is confused
its so small
just a few cottages
and the old bunker
hanna chooses not to ask any more questions
thank you for the ride
youre very kind
i wish there was more i could do for you
marissa looks kindly at hanna who is confused by the intimacy
marissa reaches into the glove compartment and retrieves a torch which she hands to hanna
here take this
hanna switches the torch on and off thinking
i hope you find what youre looking for
she gets out and shuts the door behind her
hanna looks around at the grey desolation rural poverty the ends of the earth
in the car marissa stares at her then drives off
hanna walks through the trees along a track
overgrown not used for many years
she reaches a hidden entrance off the track
by the entrance there is an old battered sign
hanna looks at the old iron gate
it has not been opened in a long time
she stares at the sign tries the gate yes locked
then she climbs the gate
she nearly tears her clothes on the spikes at the top of the gate then leaps over and exhausted four days without real sleep begins to walk up the narrow
tree lined driveway
hanna approaches the gaping mouth of an underground bunker
she stops looks down at the torch in her hand switches it on and walks into the darkness
with only the torch light to see by hanna treads warily deeper into the tunnels as behind her the small aperture of daylight recedes slowly to nothing
the tunnels seem to stretch on for miles ahead of her
hanna reaches a junction where four tunnels meet
she shines her torch down each tunnel trying to decide which way to go
she stops when she sees a little way down one of the tunnels a childs forgotten shoe
hanna steps forward and shines her torch down at the tiny red shoe its buckle rusted
she walks on into the dark
hanna finds a door which she pushes at
the door is stiff but hanna uses her full weight and soon shes made enough of a gap to squeeze through
at first hanna has difficulty making out where she is but dotted here and there are parts of an old nursery
the walls are painted with a blue sky clouds and the figures of children holding hands
she begins to remember as from a distant place she hears the sound of children laughing
she shines her torch in the direction of the laughter and catches a glimpse of a child dressed in a party frock and hat playing hide and seek
she shines her torch the other way and theres another then a third and a fourth
for a moment the room seems to be filled with laughing children
then in an instant theyre gone again and silence returns
hanna lit only be the reflected light of her torch knows she has been here before
she walks on through the tunnels
hanna enters a long hall which was once the childrens dormitory
at one end is a steep pile of metal bed frames
from a distant place in her memory hanna begins to hear the sound of children singing
happy birthday to you happy birthday to you
from the far end of the dormitory come a procession of children the first of whom is carrying a large birthday cake lit with birthday candles
the childrens faces glow eerily in the candle light
theyre looking at hanna and walking straight towards her as they sing
happy biirrrrthday dear
the children arrive at hanna lifting the cake towards her
happy birthday to you
hanna leans forward takes a deep breath and blows
the children disappear with the flames of the candles
the sound of a womans approaching footsteps echo through the tunnel
hanna swings her torch beam in the direction of the footsteps
she freezes as she sees a pair of green shoes walking towards her
the same shoes as in wilhelms house
hanna raises her torch beam to see the face of the woman from the car
youre marissa wiegler
hanna starts to shake
marissa has her gun pointing at hanna but her expression is the same sunny uncomplicated smile as earlier
hanna breathing fast
marissa speaks in english
dont worry sweetie
i dont want to hurt you
marissas tone has turned into a twisted interpretation of maternal care
hanna does not move
like a wild animal cornered
i could have killed you already when you were asleep in the car
hannas still shaking
hanna now sees isaacs and his henchmen three of them all with hunting rifles
all ready to shoot her should she attack or run
they are some distance away not coming any closer
did erik tell you about this place
where are the other children
she looks at marissa who waits then answers quietly
theyre all sleeping
i dont believe you
i can protect you hanna
make sure you walk out of here and keep walking
grow up and grow old in safety and security
no one need know a thing
but you have to trust me
you cant talk about this with anyone
its what we call aclassified
a if you tell anyone itll be dangerous for both of us
hanna looks at her remembering what erik told her trying hard not to succumb
you killed my mother
youre mother didnt want you sweetie
i saved you
hanna just stares not believing her
im the only person left who understands who you are
the only one who cares
marissa holds out a hand to hanna for hanna to take a motherly gesture
i practically am your mother
hannas stomach turns in horror
she switches off her torch and runs into the shadows
isaacs raises his gun fires
hanna running through the darkness
behind her isaacs and the henchmen come after her
isaacs carries a large heavy torch as does one of the henchmen
the other henchmen all have night vision on their rifles
hanna crouches down she sniffs the air can smell them coming
a henchman treads carefully down the tunnel
we see his point of view through his night vision sight just the dark tunnel stretching on
like a ghost hannas face appears up close her eyes a pearly white
she slams the gun back in the henchmans face
still in night vision we see the fight quick and hard
the flash of a single bullet illuminates his death
silence once more
hanna now has the first henchmans rifle
from around the corner into the next tunnel she hears the sound of feet on dirt
she presses herself against the tunnel waits listening hears the feet again and in one movement raises the rifle and spins round the corner
through her night vision sight she sees a deer scared eyes staring back at her
she releases her grip on the trigger and the deer scampers into the darkness
hanna comes into the old laboratory
through her night vision sights we see the white tiles and smashed equipment
she senses someone coming after her and ducks behind a lab bench
a henchman enters the lab carrying a hand gun and a small torch
his footsteps make a crunching sound as he steps through the broken glass that litters the floor
hanna rises from her hiding place and stands straight into the torch light
she fires but is off target and only catches the henchmans left arm
he drops his torch which slides across the floor
hanna comes round the lab bench to where the henchman should be lying but hes gone
theres a trail of blood which she follows to a metal cabinet
she stops at the cabinet and fires three shots into its flimsy doors
the dead henchman slides out from the cabinet
hanna takes the dead mans hand gun and goes to retrieve the torch
she switches the torch off
isaacs unnerved presses himself against the wall of the tunnel
he feels something at his legs
points his torch to find the deer pulling at his trouser leg
he shoots it
then runs further down into the tunnel
alerted by the sound of isaacs shot hanna starts to pursue her prey
isaacs is back in the dormitory
with torch in hand he searches under the beds
behind him he hears hanna enter
he switches off his torch and crawls under a bed
hanna walks slowly between the beds
under the bed isaacs is preparing to fire now watching her feet
suddenly the bed hes under is lifted straight up in the air and off him hanna has summoned enormous strength and is clutching the end of the bed
he fires hits nothing and she lets go the bed comes crashing down on him again
his torch rolls away
his arms are trapped under the bed hes unable to move
with all his might isaacs pushes at the bed and lifts it off himself
hanna picks up the torch and slams the torch across his temple
she grabs him by the hair and smashes his head repeatedly into the floor bam bam bam bam bam
silence hes dead
hanna sits back on the bed and looks at her bloodied hands looks down at what shes done
shocked by her own violence she begins to cry hot tears of bewilderment
she gets up and runs from the dormitory
hanna runs back through the tunnels
tears are streaming down her face as she reaches sight of the tunnel mouth and the daylight beyond
standing in silhouette is marissa
hanna slows her pace and stops when she can see the white of marissas eyes and the finger on marissas trigger
marissa raises the gun and aims at hanna but hanna comes forward again walking calmly towards her
she stops and drops her gun to the ground
everything i see is nothing i want
marissa looks at hanna her gentle childlike countenance
let me take care of you
i dont want that
hanna turns her back on marissa and starts to walks in the opposite direction
marissa watches her walk away
hanna walks waiting for the shot to come
hanna spins fires directly at camera
the sun spreads its golden fingers through the trees catching the early morning dew
a wide shot of the hannas cabin wisps of smoke rise from its chimney
hanna steps out of the cabin
shes back wearing her furs again
in her hands she carries a cup of hot milk and a small wooden bowl
in voice over we hear hanna reading from her beloved encyclopaedia
the earth is the third planet from the sun and the fifth largest of the eight planets in the solar system
hanna sits down on a tree trunk outside the cabin and pours some milk into the bowl then drinks a little for herself
home to millions of species including humans earth is the only place in the universe where life is known to exist
she raises her head and makes a small clicking sound
her friend the snow fox appears from the trees
the fox now has a small family of cubs
hanna watches as the cubs approach the milk and begin to drink
the planet formed over four and a half billion years ago and life appeared on its surface within a billion years
hanna sits back and feels the sunlight on her face
above her the trees are beginning to leaf
it is expected to continue supporting life for another one and a half billion years after which the rising luminosity of the sun will eliminate it all
hanna surveys her beautiful world
