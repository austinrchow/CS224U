written by bruce a evans raynold gideon close on a polaroid of a dimly lit couple locked in a sexual embrace
we cannot see their faces
tortured god grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change
our view travels sensuously down the womans naked torso to find the mans head buried between her legs
why do you fight it so hard earl
courage to change the things i can
come on youve been a good boy for a long time you deserve a little fun
our view moves back up to the womans breasts
earl brooks reflection in a mirror
earl in his s has on a tuxedo
hes in front of a sink in a public bathroom and hes whispering to his image
and wisdom to know the difference
picking up speed against the hunger in his head living one day at a time enjoying one moment at a time accepting hardship as a pathway to peace
from far away comes the sound of applause
men in tuxedos and women in gowns
brooks is seated at one of the front tables with his wife emma also s
the audiences hands are coming together for what a man at the microphone has just said
brooks is smiling but not clapping and although his lips dont move we can hear even faster now taking as he did this sinful world as it is not as
i would have it
trusting that he will make all things right if i surrender to his will
that i may be reasonably happy in this life and supremely happy with him forever in the next
the man at the microphone raises his arms to quiet the audience
i could go on and on about what a great guy earl is how he cuts his toe nails
how he gives freely of his time and money but lets get earl up here to speak for himself
ladies and gentlemen i give you a businessman a philanthropist a great friend and the evanston chamber of commerce man of the year
brooks kisses emma stands and after accepting congratulations along the way arrives at the podium
thank you all very much
the first thing i would like to say is
i dont even know how i cut my toe nails
applause and laughter from the audience
twenty years ago when i started the brooks box factory i never dreamed i would one day be standing here
a silver lexus ls glides past us
did you see sis wallaces dress
brooks is driving
emma is in the passenger seat
theyre holding hands
you could see her nipples
at her age she should keep those things hidden
brooks is only listening to his wife with one ear and underneath what she is saying we can barely hear god grant me the serenity to accept
the only thing that would have made this evening more perfect is if jane had been here
she has mid terms coming up
shes dropping out you know
nothing she does is wrong to you is it
brooks doesnt rise to the bait
well she missed a good party
as she continues we look at mr
brooks and emmas voice fades to a murmur
in the back seat a man leans out from behind mr
this is marshall
emma can neither see nor hear him
marshall exists only in mr
come on earl give yourself a break you know you want to do this
youre the fucking man of the year you deserve it
its not like its not set up
you already know how to by pass the alarm you know how to pick the locks
tonights the perfect night
over his shoulder no marshall i said no
i heard you earl but you dont mean no
emma feels mr
whats the matter
brooks pulls himself back into the moment
you were frowning
i was thinking of what i didnt say in the speech
they laughed they were touched i dont think anyone felt left out
from the back seat they have their dance class tonight
what if we go by and just look at them
theres no harm in just having a look
no means no marshall
to emma the food tonight was very good but i wasnt crazy about the dessert
would you like to stop somewhere and get something sweet
in a booth mr
brooks and emma are sharing a sundae
brooks steals a look at the arthur murray dance class that is taking place behind the full length windows fronting the second floor of the building across the street
labradors are supposed to be nice or maybe a rescue mutt
the pounds a pretty sad place if you want me to ill go with you
theres an irish lab i read about and i think the breeder is
brooks turns his attention back to the dancers and again emmas voice fades to a murmur
brooks and marshall who is seated on the other side of emma are focused on one particular couple
the man and woman are not great dancers nor are they especially attractive but mr
brooks and marshall are fascinated with them
marshall leans forward and looking slyly around emma at mr
i bet your dicks getting hard isnt it just imagining what they would look like dead
savoring the ice cream mr
two story modern
not ostentatious but the elegance of the line and the grounds say theres big money here
through the door of the dressing area emma can be seen taking off her evening clothes
hidden by the darkness on the other side of the bed mr
brooks is hunched forward on a chair his head in his hands
his bow tie is undone but hes still wearing his tuxedo
in obvious torment he is whispering to himself
i cant do this i cant do this i cant do this please dont let me do this god grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change
in the dressing area emma is putting on her sleep wear
brooks steps into the doorway
im going to stay up a while maybe go to the studio and play with some glazes
okay im going to read
if im not awake wake me when you come back
brooks comes forward puts his arms around emma and hugs her then easing back kisses her
i thought you were wonderful tonight
brooks exits the back door and starts down a path that leads away from the house
to himself dont do this dont do this please dont do this dont do this dont do please dont do this
he passes through a screen of trees and arrives at a small beautiful industrial looking building
no windows except for a narrow strip on three sides just under the edge of the roof
brooks lets himself in with a key
exquisitely unique handmade handglazed bowls vases cups plates are scattered haphazardly on shelves and tables around the room
this is mr
brookss ceramics studio
brooks turns on the big industrial kiln and sets the temperature then in a series of quick cuts changes out of his tuxedo into his work clothes which he selects
from a dozen identical pairs of khaki shirts and pants hanging in a closet
below the pants and shirts are a dozen pairs of identical leather work shoes
the windbreaker he puts on is also from a dozen identical windbreakers
he takes a set of car keys off a hook next to a door which opens into a garage
under the light is an older model non descript toyota
the toyota backs into an alley and with the garage door closing behind it pulls away
marshall is up front with mr
oh lordy earl my boy ive missed this
we are going to have so much fun
this is the last time marshall
the very last time
a mixture of modest houses and apartment buildings
brookss toyota is parked in the semi dark cast by a tree
we rise over the car over the trees over the houses to the other side of the block and come down to find mr
brooks working the lock on the side door of a small bungalow
he has on surgical gloves
the pick is extracted the handle turned
the door opens
theres a chain
brooks removes a pair of bent rubber tipped forceps from a pocket inserts it in the chain pulls the door to gives the tool a twist and gently pushes the
the chain has been released
brooks quietly closes the door and holding his breath stands very still and listens
theres a faint indistinct sound coming from the recesses of the house
brookss feet glide out of the pantry
now coming slightly behind him is another pair of legs encased in dark slacks
move up the person in the black slacks is marshall
in the middle of the kitchen the sound is now recognizable
its the moans of a couple fucking
this disturbs mr
brooks he hesitates
marshall leans in and hisses fiercely in his ear
dont you dare quit on me you piece of shit
i want to see what theyre doing
brookss spine stiffens and hes going forward again
entering a hallway he reaches into his jacket
when his hand reappears its inside a ziplock bag his fingers around the butt of a silenced pistol
he brings the hand and bag to his mouth and tightens the ziplock against his wrist
the two men arrive at a door thats slightly ajar
behind it the sounds of the love making are becoming more intense
brooks nudges the door with his foot
it opens enough for he and marshall to see the couple inside
the man and woman from the arthur murray dance class are naked on the bed
as much as mr
brooks hates himself for it he loves watching
he can now hear his heart beating in his ears
he begins to breathe in unison with the couple but his expression is distant almost clinical
when the couple climaxes when they come mr
brookss face goes blank
on the bed the woman rolls off her partner and the two of them lie there basking in the afterglow
behind them mr
brooks pushes the door fully open and slips into the room
they dont know hes there until he speaks
both the man and woman jump with surprise and look
the woman screams and scrabbles at the sheet to cover herself
what the fuck
then he sees the gun
hey man dont
to the woman be quiet and sit up
in an attempt to get away the woman pushes herself back against the wall
she cant take her eyes off mr
brooks and she cant stop screaming
a hole appears above her left eye
the impact of mr
brookss high velocity
slug bounces her head off the wall
the screaming stops
the man opens his mouth and begins to shake
the bullet through his brain makes him instantly dead and he crumples onto the girl
brooks looks at what hes done
his nostrils flare at the scent of death
then he moves hes got work to do
on his way to the bed the pistol goes into his pocket
barks whoa earl what the fuck is this
brooks snaps a look
the curtains of the bedroom window are open and over half of the apartments in a four story building on the other side of an alley can see into this
most of their windows are dark
and theres no one looking out of the windows that are lit
these pigs liked to fuck with the blinds open you should have known that earl
this is a big mistake for you earl
going to the window almost like i want to get caught huh marshall
well dont fucking do that
i dont think either of us would enjoy spending the rest of our lives in jail or a lethal injection
he grabs a side of cloth in either hand and yanks the curtains closed
close on a polaroid of the dance couple in a sexual pose
the attitude of the bodies is awkward and very reminiscent of the ones in the polaroid we opened the movie with
brooks is kneeling naked in front of the kiln where his murder clothes are being reduced to ash
arranged on the floor are polaroids of the dance couple in sexual positions
please forgive me
please forgive me
as we look closer at the photographs we realize by a smear of blood here and there and the distortion of the limbs that these tableaus were arranged after the
couple was killed
one by one mr
brooks picks up his souvenirs
he lingers over the last image and from where hes sitting on the edge of a table dont even think about it
you know the rules
brooks throws the polaroids into the fire of the kiln
now go up and make love to your beautiful wife
in the kiln the polaroids burst into flame
the sunlight exposes its charm
if it werent for the police tape the uniformed officers and the plainclothes detectives it looks like it would be a cool place to live
an older detective an african american comes out on the porch and calls to two other detectives who are drinking coffee on the lawn where the fuck is atwood
i called ten minutes ago they said she was on her way
she doesnt get here soon these bodies wont even be dead anymore
a uniformed cop standing guard at the tape you looking for the lady cop
shes been sitting in her car right over there for the last half hour
special detective tracy atwood somewhere in her s is behind the wheel
the door is open
by the expression on her face we might guess that detective atwood has simply forgotten to get out of the car
on the seat next to her is a copy of the chicago tribune
the headline of a middle article on the first page reads the move up to atwoods face
the older detective followed by the younger detective approaches
you thinking of joining us anytime soon atwood
atwood doesnt look at the detectives for a long beat and when she does her expression is not friendly
i really hated yesterday snyder and then today came along
as she gets out of the car the men notice the bandages on her wrists and falling into step with her on the way to the house
what happened to your wrists
atwood holds up her hands to reveal the extent of the bandages
i tried to commit suicide
the young detective laughs
atwood whirls on him
whats so funny
i dont know i heard it was because you were drunk and got into a fight with a fish tank
atwood sticks her finger into the young detectives chest
who are you gonna believe
me or the fucking fish
atwood turns and leaves the men
under his breath shes nuts
they catch up to atwood who has squatted down to examine the lock on the front door
there are some scratches in the side door cylinder
other than that no signs of forced entry
the alarm was armed and we even had to cut the security chains to get in
straightens up this guy hasnt been active for over two years
she enters the house
from the way atwood looks at her surroundings as she crosses the living room we get the feel that this woman misses nothing
we think hes either dead or in jail on some other charge
this is probably a copycat
detective snyder points her down the hall toward the bedroom and follows
thats why we called you
youre the god that tells us peons if we have a simple murder here or something we can dump on you
atwood arrives in the doorway of the bedroom where the murders took place and stops
the bodies of the dance couple are now on the floor
the man is propped up against the bed in a sitting position
the woman has her head in the mans crotch
almost like mr
brooks atwoods nostrils flare but in atwoods case its not the scent of death that arouses her but its like shes searching for the scent of her prey
in a glance she memorizes the room then steps inside
the crime scene technicians shift to accommodate atwoods inspection
indicating the victims he always rearranges the bodies but this is out of character
he has never left them in such a crude position
usually its more romantic with their arms around each other kissing their mouths open their tongues touching
so we have a copycat
where are the thumbprints
snyder points to a bare space of wall above the bed
atwood leans in to look at two bloody thumbprints placed side by side
one his one hers
thats what it looks like
there are two holes gouged into the plaster of the wall
the bullets went completely through the victims
the killer recovered the slugs
atwood unfolds and after another look around the room goes to the window and cracks the curtains
theres the four story apartment building across the alley its windows staring down at her
were these open or closed when you got here
atwood tries the cord the curtains are stuck
she returns her attention to the murder scene
it has never been revealed to the public that the thumbprint killer retrieves the slugs
so this ones yours
i dont fucking need this
she doubles back and cracks the curtains for another look at the four story apartment building
have you checked the tenants of that building
only a few of them are home they say they didnt see anything
we checked the whole neighborhood so far nobody saw a thing
atwood nods and turns back to the bodies
leaving them like this he must have been angry at them for some reason
she reaches down and runs a hand over the carpet
where would they keep their vacuum cleaner
a puzzled snyder follows her out of the room
atwood opens a service closet
theres the vacuum cleaner
ill bet you a hundred bucks snyder there is no bag in that vacuum cleaner
i have no idea what youre looking for
atwood unzips the cover
there is no bag inside
he vacuumed the house and took the bag
that is scary smart
detective atwood is standing on an empty capped plastic gallon milk carton looking over the fence into the back yard of the murder house
snyder has his hand on her back to steady her
he releases her
she hops down and directs her attention at the four story apartment building
our best hope is if someone in there saw something
a man comes out from behind the next door fence and strides purposefully toward them
detective tracy atwood
this is for you
she accepts the official looking document being offered
you have been served
you fucking asshole
im in the middle of a fucking murder investigation
backing away hey take it easy lady im just the messenger
what is it
my soon to be ex husbands scumbag lawyer is trying to show me how painful she can make my life if i dont give them what they want
this is not the doctor
the doctor was a couple years ago
this one is my stupid mistake
an aa meeting is getting started
brooks is one of the assembled
the leader steps into the semicircle of men and women
are there any new members
a woman comes forward
hi my name is vaughn and im an alcoholic
she rejoins the circle
brooks separates himself from the others
hi my name is earl and im an addict
when he rejoins the circle marshall is there to greet him
youre such a fucking hypocrite
if you were honest you would step out there and say hi im earl
i killed two people last night and i really got off on it but i need your help to be cured
im different marshall i wont argue that with you
this is the only place that has ever helped me be normal and ive been straight up until last night for the past two years
im not going to kill again and im not going to quit coming here because it upsets you
yeah but for the next days youre going to have to step out there and say hi im earl im an addict
and everybody will know you fell off the wagon
dont you feel stupid doing that
i feel good
a cab arrives at the front entrance of the brooks box factory a long three story brick building
a young woman is dropped off along with an assortment of luggage and boxes
we follow a thin piece of cardboard as one machine deals it off the bottom of a stack into the maw of another machine
that machine prints one side of the cardboard blue
it is handed off to the third machine which cuts the flaps
the fourth machine folds and glues those flaps and spits the piece of cardboard out onto a conveyor belt as a box
wearing safety glasses and ear protectors along with his business suit mr
brooks picks up the box and hands it to one of three similarly attired men standing nearby
this is not the top of the line or the bottom but for the money were talking about this is the quality i can provide you
brooks talks the men pass the box between them
your packaging is the first impression your customers will have of your product
brooks your daughter is waiting for you in your office
a surprised mr
brooks grabs a quick look at the pa speaker then continues
wed love to work you with on the design
its fun to challenge our machines
if you check around youll find were not the cheapest but we are the best
on his way through to his office mr
brooks smiles absently at a man waiting on the couch
the pleasant looking man in his early s nods
brooks stops at his secretarys desk
sunday did jane call and say she was coming
i would have given you that message mr
she has boxes and suitcases downstairs
hold my calls
coming in what are you doing here gorgeous
the year old girl we saw arrive by cab stands up and throws her arms around mr
im sorry daddy please dont be angry with me
brooks kisses jane on the forehead and goes to sit at his desk
i can guess what youve done but why dont you tell me and then ill decide
i dropped out of school
have you told your mother this
i wanted to speak to you first
youll have to tell her im not going to do that for you and then together the three of us will decide where to go from here
ive thought a lot about this dad
college is a waste of time for me
i dont know how you know that half way through your freshman year but
you didnt go to college dad and youre successful
i want to come and work for you
sitting on the couch shes not telling you everything shes hiding something
to jane im not hiring right now
just listen to me
what would happen to the business if god forbid something happened to you
mom would probably have to sell to strangers
im willing to start at the bottom you can treat me as a regular employee i want to learn everything there is to know about running the box business and
then when the time comes the business would stay in the family
thats sweet but youre talking about emotion not business
in fact your mother and i came very close to selling out last year
if we had been offered a little more money and they may come back to us we will sell
what would you do without
theres a knock on the door
sunday the secretary comes in and crossing to mr
brooks im sorry i know you didnt want to be disturbed the man in the waiting room insisted i give you this
she hands mr
brooks a letter size envelope
he said you would find whats inside very interesting
what is he
he wont say
ive never seen him before
i can tell him to go away if you want me to
slicing the flap of the envelope mr
brooks picks up with jane
part of spending the four years in college is to
brooks can now see the contents of the envelope
two snapshot size photos taken with a high speed digital camera
one shows the right side of mr
he is in no way identifiable but that blur of flesh appears to be looking at the dead dance couple
the second photo is a clear shot of mr
brooks closing the curtains with the dead dance couple behind him
brookss voice or his face betray the enormity of what hes looking at
to give yourself the chance to find out who you are and what you want to do
ill talk to mom but im not going back to school
where would you live
to save money i would move back home but no rules no curfew i want to be treated like an adult
brooks allows himself a slight smile
would you pay for your food would you pay rent
no dad youre a very wealthy man you can afford to keep me
brooks presses his intercom
sunday would you show the gentleman who gave you the envelope to the conference room and tell him ill meet him there and
to jane what happened to the bmw
a friend is driving it across country itll be here next weekend
to sunday through intercom and get jane a cab
he picks up the phone and holds it out to jane
call your mother
are you going to give me a job
if it were up to me and i think your mother will agree with this you should go back to school
brooks comes around the corner
hes raving at marshall whos walking beside him
you see all of this
the factory the houses the cars the money the respect
a different angle in the same hallway shows mr
brooks walking away from us
a passing employee crosses him
the men nod to each other
marshall is nowhere in sight
i like them
i dont want to lose them
and then were back to the original angle and marshall is again in the picture
thats why i didnt want to do the dance couple
stop your fucking whining earl you enjoyed doing that couple just as much as i did and look on the bright side he came to us he didnt go to
if he tries to shake us down we kill him
we make it fun but we kill him
end of story
the man from the reception area is nervously admiring a display of mr
brookss ceramic pieces
he turns at the sound of the door opening behind
what can i do for you mr
lets say smith
brooks motions him to a seat
sitting before you get the wrong impression mr
brooks im not here to shake you down
holding up the photos then these are the only copies of these photos and you have no others
i have other copies and other photos and if something were to happen to me
how did you find me mr
youre man of the year mr
your picture was in the paper
if it hadnt been i dont know what i would have done
what is it that i can help you with
ive been watching that couple for months they liked to make love with the blinds open
sometimes i would take pictures you know visual aides for later
it was fun it was a great way to get off i thought until i saw you kill them
i have to tell you i have never ever felt a rush like that ever
i know youre the thumbprint killer youve done this before
what i want is to go with you the next time you kill someone
and i would like that to be soon
from the end of the table marshall cackles a laugh
and you were worried that this was going to be unpleasant
the answer is simple
just tell him youve decided never to kill again and hell go away
you enjoy watching me suffer dont you
in a word yes
where do you think he has the other pictures
he put them in a safety deposit box but ill bet the box is at the bank where he has his checking account and the key is on his keychain
he really wants to do this hes not going to go to the cops
smith who has grown uneasy under mr
brookss stare swallows so do we have a deal
from the angle of these pictures
taps the envelope you live on the third floor of the apartment building across the alley from the couples house
yes or no mr
smith nods yes
what time do you get home from work
six thirty seven depending on the traffic
you can never come here again you can never call me
do you understand that
tomorrow night not tonight tomorrow night at eight oclock leave your apartment and walk east
ill pick you up
if youre thinking of doing anything to me mr
were both aware of the rules mr
smith but i feel i must warn you
if it turns out that you enjoy killing it can become very addictive
it could ruin your life
i want to do this
looks at marshall have i covered everything
i cant think of anything else
brooks stands up and opens the door
ill see you tomorrow night mr
on his way out mr
brooks closes the door
his chin drops on his chest and he sighs
under his breath please god please help me find a way not to do this
detective atwood comes out of the crowd on the sidewalk and enters a highrise
atwood and her attorneys a gray haired man in his s and an asian woman about the same age as atwood are on one side of the table
jesse atwoods soon to be ex husband very handsome slightly younger than atwood and sheila his attractive divorce lawyer sit across from them
weve talked to our client and weve come up with a number that we feel is more than fair
atwood is not happy with this
the attorney slides a sheet of paper to sheila
she turns it over
on it is written
we can have a check for that amount in your office by oclock
we told you at the beginning what we want and that hasnt changed
you know as well as i do counselor if we go to court youre not going to get a million five
i dont know
she holds up the front page of the chicago tribune
the hangman escapes story is circled in red
this is the front page of yesterdays paper
reads hangman escapes
now here it is
after torturing the young women thorton meeks would hang them in public places church steeples balconies freeway overpasses
your client captured mr
this is just one example of the cases my client lived through when he was married to your client
your client knew detective atwood was a homicide detective when he married her
but he had no idea of the mental anguish that being in close proximity to her work would cause him
what about the mental anguish i went through being in close proximity to him
whos gonna pay me for that
we dont need to get into this tracy
yes we do
i was the one who paid for everything while we were married and now im being asked to give him a bonus for spending time with me when ive already
paid for it in the first place
to atwood tracy this is not a lot of money for you and you know how upset i was when meeks said that he was going to escape and he
would come back and kill you
were quite willing to find out what a court would think that mental anguish is worth
you know the best thing that could happen to me right now
that you get hit by a truck and die
smiles thats it
vialo and i are leaving
she and jesse stand up youve threatened my client were going to ask for a restraining order and well see you in court
the door closes behind them
thats going to cost you tracy
standing up fuck it
it felt good
moonlight seeps around the blinds to reveal mr
smith asleep in bed
beyond the open bedroom door down the hall is only darkness until the eruption of illumination from a penlight momentarily outlines the figure of a man
then were looking at what the penlight sees
hands in surgical gloves isolate the safety deposit key and press it into a soft wax block where it leaves its impression
the light goes off
in the bedroom at the end of the hallway mr
smith begins to snore
the figure coasts silently toward the sound
smiths face is sideways on the pillow
the snores and a little drool burbles out of the corner of his mouth
the impact of something landing on the bed bounces mr
smith upright and awake
the beam from the penlight hits him in the face
he raises his hands to shield his eyes
dont worry if i were here to kill you you would already be dead
the penlight leaves mr
smith and mr
brooks places it deliberately under his own chin casting long sinister shadows up his face
hes sitting on the bed next to mr
after you left today i realized our friendship was a little one sided
so when we meet tomorrow night would you be so kind as to bring all of the pictures and the memory card from your camera
that way we can like each other simply for who we are
if you dont show up i will presume youve gone to the police and i will kill you
even if i go to jail because of you someone will find you wherever you are and kill you
the penlight goes off
theres total silence
he squints into the black
finally he gathers the courage to extend a shaky hand
the bedside lamp goes on
the room is empty
smith swings his legs out of bed and stands up
he forces himself to go to the door and from there curls his arm around the jamb into the darkness
the hall light is dazzling
a peek into the bathroom shows there is nobody there
he continues on into the living room
his camera equipment is on the table
the tripod is still set up
there is no sign of mr
smith eyes the front door
its closed and the security chain is in place
another quick scan of the room
it sure seems that hes alone
he opens the front door the length of the chain and looks up and down the hallway
slowly he closes the door
standing in the light of his living room mr
smith is more scared and strangely more excited than hes ever been in his life
in a robe and pajamas mr
brooks comes down the hallway carrying a glass of milk
the door to his daughters room is partly open
by the nightlight in the plug at the head of the bed he can see shes asleep
brooks walks to the bed leans over and kisses his daughter on the cheek
quietly its nice to have you home
the early rays of the sun are moving down the tall buildings
a garbage truck is picking up the trash
dressed for work and a smile on his face mr
brooks comes down the stairs
in the breakfast room the mood is decidedly different
his wife and daughter are leaning against opposite walls staring at the floor
ask your daughter what the real reason is she dropped out of school
i keep telling you its not the reason
you wanted to go to college you had good grades in high school your father helped you get into stanford were paying a ton of money if this is not
the reason then please dear god tell me the reason
picking up an orange juice why does your mother think you dropped out of school
to her mother and its not the reason i dropped out
being pregnant wouldnt stop me from going to school if i wanted to go
whos the father
some guy i was seeing
does he know
yes hes a married man and he doesnt want to have anything to do with me
oh honey im so sorry
im going to have an abortion anyway so there is nothing to get upset about
i wasnt even going to tell you guys
brooks looks directly at his daughter
there will be no abortion
daddy you are not going to tell me what to do
its my body and i will do what i want to do with it
brookss eyes find emmas
almost imperceptibly she shakes her head no
to his daughter youre right
i said it wrong
im not trying to tell you what to do
im trying to say that a grandchild would be a wonderful gift for your mother and me
please honey dont have an abortion
would you really want to have a grandchild even though im not married
the child is whats important
we would love it and cherish it completely and help you raise it
if it means that much to you ill think about it
walking to the lexus mr
brooks notices marshall waiting for him on the passenger side
smiles well we were right she was hiding something
flat pregnants not all of it
shes hiding something bigger
you think so
i know so and so do you
large and small color photographs pinned to a corkboard create a collage of the dance couple murder scene
standing in front of this is captain lister a tall slim open faced woman in her mid fifties and the lead crime scene technician we saw earlier at the murder
its not whats here its whats not here thats interesting
theres not a trace of anything foreign
if i didnt know better id say these people were killed by a ghost
the autopsy found a tiny piece of plastic in the female victims brain
were checking with the ammunition manufacturers
entering the room thats a dead end he bags the gun
i dont understand
he ziplocks a one gallon plastic freezer bag to his wrist over the gun
a little bit of plastic is carried by the first slug the ejected shells go into the bag and it limits the powder residue
to captain lister i hear you were looking for me
to the technician sigy
to atwood did you find anything
did they have enemies did they owe money did anybody ever notice someone watching the house
so far they are mr
and miss normal
backing away if you find anything call it might help me
i received a subpoena from your husbands lawyer for your work records where you were date and times for the past two years
almost three quarters of your cases are current
i cant let that information go into open court

atwood is waiting for an elevator
the doors open
the car is empty
atwood gets in and presses the key for her destination then slumps into a corner for the ride
the doors close
the elevator begins to move
all at once atwood screams
her pent up anger and frustration rip the air and she goes nuts
she punches the wall of the elevator kicks it throws herself to the other side bangs her head against that wall punches it kicks it all the while screaming
then the tears come
the screams stop and she settles upright against the back wall where she strikes her chest repeatedly with the flat of her closed hand
what is wrong with me
what is wrong with me
what is wrong with me
the yellow police tape that still circles the yard snaps in the wind
up the driveway out of sight of all the other homes theres a movement at the side door of the house
a closer inspection reveals that its detective atwood
from under her umbrella she studies her surroundings and as if shes speaking to the killer she speaks to herself
did you choose them because of where they lived or how they looked or what jobs they had
or did you just pick them because at the instant you saw them you had decided to kill someone
the side door was perfect
no one could see you pick the lock
with a key she lets herself in
parked against the curb opposite the driveway of the murder house is an old green pontiac convertible with the top up
the drivers window is down and from inside a woman late s is watching the house
atwood stops in the pantry almost in the exact spot where mr
the quiet is filled by the rain drumming on the roof
the wind rattles the windows
how did you know where they were in the house
she steps into the kitchen
on the way across she bumps into a chair
its darker tonight than it was on your night
but still how did you manage not to bump into the furniture
did you have a little light
that would be too dangerous
ill bet you were in the house before
so i should ask the neighbors if they saw a meter reader around the house or a telephone repairman or someone from the gas company
these musings take her through the living room to the entrance of the hallway where she pauses and looks both ways
once again how did you know where they were
did you check the rooms before you found them
she had his semen in her vagina they had just made love did you hear them or was there a light on
she steps into the hall
and when did you bag the gun
because even though im sure youre an expert at it theres still a chance of noise from the plastic
she continues down the hall to the bedroom
was the door open or did you have to open it
she opens the door and goes in
were they asleep or awake
was the light on or did you turn it on
because i know you you wouldnt risk a shot in the dark
she turns on the overhead light
what if it wasnt that light that was on but this one
she turns on a bedside light and goes back to the door and turns off the overhead
if the dance couple were on the bed and their blood was not on the wall the room would look exactly the way it did when mr
brooks said hello
what thrill do you get by killing people
is it sexual is it hate is it power
do you feel remorse
probably that part of your brain doesnt exist
do you have emotions of love or affection or joy
or have you learned to fake them so you wont stand out in a crowd
shes at the window now feeling the curtains
what if these are stuck closed because you yanked them closed
which means they were open when you came into the room
she separates the fabric and looks out the rain streaked window at the four story building across the alley
there are lights on in almost all the apartment windows
and miss normal made love with the curtains open and the lights on someone in that building noticed them and may have seen you
she allows the fabric to drop back into place and turns to look at the bed
was that what you were angry about
moving slowly across a neutral colored wall
thank you for your time
a door is closed
we come to the corner and are looking down a hallway at atwood coming toward us
we move to her and arrive just as she raises her fist to knock
before she can the door opens and she and mr
smith who is on his way out of his apartment are surprised that the other one is suddenly there
each one takes a half step back
the manila envelope that was wedged under mr
smiths left arm hits the floor
you scared me
bends down and picks up the envelope i was about to knock
im detective atwood with the chicago police
accepting the envelope thank you
through the open door atwood can see mr
smiths camera on a table and the collapsed tripod leaning against the wall
are you a photographer
glances at her list mr
eh its kind of a hobby i just started
i dont know if youre aware but there was a murder
oh yes in the house across the alley
did you happen to see anything unusual or suspicious that night around that house
anything at all
smith puts on his thinking expression and pauses a little bit before no
i wondered that when i heard what happened but
looks at his watch im sorry im meeting someone and i dont want to be late
he moves into the hallway closing the door behind him
heres my card if you hear anything or remember anything
taking the card i wish i could be of more help but sorry
watching him walk away amid the crinkle of his raincoat detective atwood maybe because of her womans intuition or maybe because shes a good cop wonders what is in that
manila envelope under his arm
the thought is gone almost as soon as it comes and she faces about to the next door
hunched against the rain mr
smith is acutely aware of the traffic
his eyes strain to see the occupants of each passing car
he doesnt give a second thought to the older non descript toyota parked against the far curb
brooks is in the drivers seat
marshall is in the back
theyre both tracking the progress of mr
he looks clean
he looks like hes alone
no im telling you he wants to do this
i guess i should turn around and go pick him up
maybe hell get killed crossing the street and save us the mess of doing it
smith looks around
hes not sure that sound was for him
but when the toyota honks again and flashes its lights mr
smith waves and splashes to the center of the street
even though he stops to let it pass a car sounds its horn and swerves to avoid him
smith crosses behind the toyota and opens the passenger door
smith flops into the seat
its really coming down out there
they say itll be sunny tomorrow
smith fumbles with the buttons and zipper on his raincoat
i never trust those guys when they say its going to be clear it always rains and when they say its going to rain its sunny
he comes up with the manila envelope
heres what you asked for
brooks takes it and hefts it
the pictures and the memory card all here
you and i both know that not all the pictures are in here and you made a copy of the memory card isnt that so
but you understand my position
brooks favors him with a wolfish smile
yes i do
but its my hope that once you get to know me better youll feel comfortable in giving me all that ive asked for
that sounds fair
oh i almost forgot
i thought you might be interested in this
his hand comes forward with a card
its the policewoman whos looking for you
marshall snaps forward from the back seat
weve never known anyone whos looking for us before
brooks pinches the rectangle of paper away from mr
smith for a closer view
weve got to find out everything there is to know about this woman
this is too close marshall too damn close
smith interrupts mr
brookss focus on detective atwoods card
so what do we do now
whats the plan for the evening
brooks slips the envelope under the seat and starts the car
we drive around until we see someone we think we might enjoy killing
i thought you might already have someone in mind
i dont enjoy this mr
i do it because im addicted to it
and before you entered my life i had vowed i would never kill again
so this is your party you can chose anyone you want and well do it together
can it be someone i know
you never kill someone you know
thats the easiest way to get caught
the toyota enters the traffic
an older woman in a stewardess uniform is standing in the doorway of her apartment
atwood is in front of her in the i wasnt in town that night my roommate was maybe he saw something
may i speak to him
hes on his way to tokyo now hes also a flight attendant
did the victims ever leave the curtains in the bedroom open
all the time
i dont know if they thought we couldnt see them fucking or they didnt care
heres my card could you ask your roommate to call me when he gets back the people at that number will find me any hour of the day or night
i wont be here but ill leave him a note
brooks toyota is cruising in the flow of traffic
maybe i already know how to pick the locks on the house if i dont
i buy one of those locks and i practice on it same with the alarm
some i know how to bypass some i have to study
you dont mind me asking these questions
this is your first time youre interested
and you should be if youre
a neutral colored pickup swerves out of the next lane into mr
brooks is forced to slam on his brakes to avoid running up the pickups tailpipe
brooks angrily lays on the horn
the brake lights of the pickup flash in response causing mr
brooks to brake again
it was his fault
what an asshole
leans forward maybe mr
smith would like to kill the driver of the pickup
smith what about the driver of the pickup
what if we killed him
oh fuck yes
ive always wanted to kill someone who fucked with me in traffic
the pickup makes a right onto a side street
do you want to kill the driver of the pickup or the owner they may not be the same
okay well follow until we get a look at him or her would it bother you to kill a woman
an assholes an asshole
brooks begins to slow down
what are you doing
the asshole shouldnt know weve decided to follow him or her
detective atwood is on her way out the outer door when the hair on the back of her neck stands on end
footsteps can be heard running toward her through the rain
her hand goes under her jacket and comes out holding a glock mm
she sidesteps out of the light into the grayness at the edge of the doorway
now she sees the runner
a hood hides the face
she cant tell if its a man or a woman
detective atwood thumbs the glocks safety to the off position
the runner passes white breath coming from an unseen mouth
she waits while the figure recedes then with the gun still in hand she fishes into a pocket for a cell phone and heads in the opposite direction
a finger speedials a number
after a second ring a answers yes
puts the phone to her ear its tracy
can you carve out some time for me tonight
ill be home in an hour and a half
ill see you there
the phone is shut the umbrella unfurled and the darkness swallows her up
the neutral colored pickup is parked in front
the driver gets out
it has stopped at the curb just beyond the entrance to the mini mart parking lot
brooks and mr
smith watch the driver come around the front of another car before entering the store
the light reveals the driver to be a tall middle age preppie guy with close cropped dark hair and dark rimmed glasses
would you recognize him if you saw his drivers license picture
ive memorized the license number you write it down
when you get home go on the internet and find out everything you can about this guy
we arent going to kill him tonight
we could but then we wouldnt be in control
we could leave loose ends and we both know the danger of that
squints at the pickups license i got it
look at me
close your eyes
whats the number
smith opens his eyes and grins sheepishly
dont feel bad ive been doing this a long time
he points to a holder on the dash pen paper
write it down
copying the number what was your first time
you really dont want to know that much about me mr
the lane lines are in place
detective atwood is the only one in the water
up and down she goes with a long smooth stroke flipping the turns
shes not swimming for pleasure shes working out
the underwater lights cast rippling shadows on the walls and ceiling and since they are the only illumination the room feels spooky
atwoods fingers touch the wall
she raises her head to check her time then takes off her goggles
hanging onto the gutter she tries to catch her breath lowers herself under the surface blows a lungful of bubbles comes up to face larry a man slightly younger than
she is in a beautiful suit perched on the edge of the deck looking down at her
he has a dress on a hangar over one shoulder and a pair of shoes dangling from the fingers of his other hand
i brought a dress and a pair of shoes
i thought we could leave from here
she lifts herself to him and they kiss
detective atwood and larry are at a balcony table overlooking a well populated dance floor
the music is s and s performed by a live band
i gave him my drivers license my student id he didnt look anything like me luckily they never checked
i did something like that except i was the one who took the test
it wasnt math a friend of mine was a theology major and needed a second language to get into the masters program
she started her career in theology with a lie
isnt that what all theology is based on
did you pass the test
dont tell me she ended up as mother teresa or the pope
no she realized very quickly there wasnt enough money in religion for her the last i heard shed written a diet book that was very successful
she stayed in religion
atwood smiles her fingers find larrys and they intertwine
the view floats over the balcony
as it slowly drops the people on the dance floor couple by couple disappear until there are only three couples left one of them is atwood and larry
her head is on his shoulder
its a slow dance
larry is very good and wherever he leads atwood easily follows
the lights begin to dim and we move in
larry touches his lips to atwoods neck
she arches back and he kisses her neck again and again
his lips move up and find hers and we are now close on the kiss
gently the lips separate and we slowly retreat
looking into her eyes larry traces her lips with a finger then replaces that finger with his tongue
his lips brush a cheek down her neck to where it meets her shoulder his teeth close softly on the muscle by now we are far enough away to realize
that atwood and larry have no clothes on and we are what light there is is coming from a room we cant see
larry nibbles at atwood collarbone kisses a breast strokes his hands down her sides
he brushes his lips back and forth across her stomach and then down to where the flesh of her belly meets her pubic hair
shes watching all of this in a mirror on the opposite wall
then he sinks to his knees and buries his head between her legs
from low in her throat atwood moans
we lose sight of the couple as we move around a corner
atwood is propped up against the headboard the sheet pulled up over her breasts
the door to the bathroom opens
larry dressed in his suit minus the tie comes out kneels on the bed and kisses her
thank you this was wonderful
for me too
ill see you then
id like that
the money is in the usual place
its not just the money tracy
i like you
i like you too larry
send me a bill for the dress and the shoes
the rain is muffled by the trees
move slowly toward the building then up the side to peek through the narrow window that circles just below the roof line
in the center of the room the kiln relieves the darkness with a yellow red glow whose rim touches a slash of white light coming from under a door tucked
in a corner
we creep through the white light across the floor thats littered with splashes of paint and smears of clay to the office door and peer under it
in front of us are chair casters and two bare feet and legs
i think that was right
with the taxes we pay youd think they could make it more difficult to hack into the police personnel files
we tip toe under the door
its crammed with file cabinets
sketches for pottery pieces are taped to the walls along with photos of mr
brooks jane and emma
brooks clad only in a t shirt and underwear is sitting in front of a computer
marshall dressed as he usually is is in a chair at his side
they are both staring at the monitor where on one side of the screen is detective atwoods police id photo on the other side of the screen mr
brooks is scrolling through her personnel file
her fathers gerald atwood why does that ring a bell
someone you did business with someone we killed
not someone we killed
college of william and mary
shes been a cop for eleven years
married doctor carlson divorced dr
carlson married jesse vialo
separated from jesse vialo sued for support by jesse vialo seeing a shrink because of jesse vialo
excellent fitness report though
she caught the hangman the guy that escaped the other day
shes caught a lot of people
and look here this isnt the first time shes been hunting for us
i wonder what the deal was with her and jesse vialo
brooks taps a key that minimizes atwoods file then drags it to the right hand corner
in the middle of a key stroke it hits him
now i remember
her father gerald atwood never did business with him but emma and i met him a couple times big political fundraiser
he owns or owned one of the largest insurance groups in the country and a lot of other stuff
tap tap tap
jesse vialos drivers license comes up
good looking a little younger than she is
snorts she married him on the rebound from the doctor and ill bet he married her for her money and her connections
the old man being rich doesnt mean shes rich
maybe hes one of those guys who would rather give it to the opera than to his kids
wouldnt she have to declare any outside income and holdings to the police
he restores atwoods file
tap tap tap tap
the men study the screen then look at each other
the opera didnt get much
why would a woman with her education and worth plus million dollars and probably more to come want to be a cop
i like that about her
youre such a fucking snob earl
you like her because shes rich
no i like her because she found something thats hers
its not the family business
and shes good at it
id like jane to find something thats hers and that she could be good at
thats exactly why atwood scares the shit out of me
shes a cop who doesnt need the money and shes looking for us
thats one fucking dangerous human being
the fact that youre not wrong doesnt make me admire her any less
at a table the asian attorney is going over a brief
there are two foamy coffees in to go cups in front of her
detective atwood arrives at the table
she reaches out the women shake hands
i got you a latte
sitting thanks and thanks for meeting me here
we got an injunction to quash the subpoena for your work records yesterday
theyve already appealed
that doesnt help me does it
your father has a lot of political muscle
my father does nothing for nothing
if youre willing to play the game and ride a desk for a year i think we can settle for one two five one five
then the only other option is money
tell me how high you are willing to go
i can try
if i were on the other side id hold out for more
how much more
give me a cap and thats how high well go
try and get a number out of them first
i want to know what ballpark im playing in and if its a lump sum is it less than something thats paid in installments
ill call them today
atwood stands up with her coffee
id like to get this done as soon as possible
the asian attorney also stands and gathering her papers and coffee
are you working on the thumbprint killer this time
that ones creepy to me
the doors are locked the alarms are armed and the people are dead
it makes you feel like youre not safe anywhere
atwood nods and opens the front door then follows the attorney out
where are you parked
im right over there
im down the street
call me as soon as you have something
she starts to walk away
i almost forgot your husband says theres a picture of him holding some trophy that you still have
he took all those pictures
he took everything
he claims its his favorite picture and you put it up where you store your suitcases
i know its petty but youre going through a divorce
atwood strides toward her car
the pedestrian traffic is light
its too early for the stores to be open
up ahead a brown van is idling at the curb the sliding side door is open
atwood can see inside
empty except for some furniture blankets
the person in the drivers seat turns to look into the back
its the woman who was watching atwood outside the murder house
her hands are unseen in leather gloves
she looks up and their eyes meet
the contact is instantly broken
atwood takes a deep breath and smiles
after the rain the air is brisk and clean
its good to be alive
atwood is body checked by a man who springs out of the recess of a doorway
his arms wrap around her shes lifted off her feet and the man throws himself and her into the van
the wind is knocked out of atwood when she lands left shoulder first on the furniture blankets the man on top of her
the man is thorton meeks the hangman six feet a solid two hundred pounds
hes also wearing tight leather gloves
the brown van accelerates fast away from the curb
his body crushing hers meeks kisses atwoods cheek
surprise surprise tracy
i told you i was coming back to get you
he frees his right hand and pulls his gun
i already know where im gonna hang you
but first im gonna watch her
indicates the driver have some fun with you then shes gonna watch me have some fun with you
he kisses her again and puts the gun to atwoods head
now dont move
he raises up and straddles her
you know the drill im gonna put the cuffs on
with his left hand he fishes a pair of handcuffs from a back pocket and snaps them on atwoods right wrist
now the left
he rolls atwood on her back and with the chain of the handcuff pulls her right arm toward her left
all meeks talk has allowed atwood to catch her breath and suddenly she jerks her head up into the gun and screams at the top of her lungs
at the same time she pulls hard against the handcuff with her right wrist
a startled meeks is thrown off balance
the gun comes away from atwoods head
her left arm now free atwood swings her palm with all of her might into meeks right ear
his eardrum breaks
he instinctually reaches to cover the damaged ear with his gun hand
the driver doubles around to see whats happening
from outside hoonnnkk
the drivers attention returns to the road
atwood swings again
this time she snags the barrel of the gun and using it as a lever bends meeks hand back on the wrist
the gun goes off
neither one of them is hit
at the same time atwood pulls hard on the handcuff that meeks is holding in his left hand and twists into him
this dislodges meeks and hes off of her
snarling like animals they fight for the gun
atwoods leverage breaks meeks trigger finger
his grip loosens on the weapon
she pulls it out of his hand
a quick push skitters it across the floor
it drops through the open side door into the street
atwood rolls away and reaches for her ankle gun
now its meeks turn
a sharp tug on the chain of the handcuff stalls her motion
he flicks his other arm and a switchblade is delivered into his right hand
the blade comes out
atwood is reaching again for her ankle gun
she sees the flash of metal and flings her head back
luckily all she receives is a deep gash above her right eye
blood immediately begins to cascade over her brow
meeks grins and gives another sharp tug on the handcuff to pull atwood into the range of his knife
with one foot atwood kicks at him with the other she pushes off and propels herself backward to grab a handful of the drivers hair
atwoods weight hinges the drivers head back until shes looking at the ceiling
her scream is equal parts pain and surprise
the brown van veers into the on coming traffic
the driver of the car dead ahead swerves
the van solidly clips the rear of that car
the sudden deceleration of that impact slingshots atwood and meeks forward
she hits the back of the drivers seat
meeks has further to go
he loses his hold on the handcuffs and smashes into the passenger seat
her right hand now free atwood scratches for the gun on her hip
careening across its lane the van sideswipes a parked car
that impact rips atwoods hand out of the drivers hair and sends her sliding on her knees toward the side door
on her way she unclips her gun and is bringing it out of her holster when meeks who has managed to hang onto the passenger seat sees this and slams
a foot into her chest
atwood is launched backward out the side door
in slow motion atwood flies through the air while at normal speed the van is leaving her behind
butt first atwood hammers into the back window of a parked car
the shattering glass breaks her fall
groggily she rolls out of the indentation
gun still in hand and blood covering one side of her face she slides off the car to stand in the street
the van is nowhere in sight
captain lister is watching a doctor sew up the gash on detective atwoods forehead
we found the van in an underground lot about two miles from where they left you
it was stolen last night
detective snyder comes in and hands a packet of photographs to atwood
these are the women we have pictures of who know meeks
meeks and the woman none of the attendants remember seeing them
as detective atwood begins to go through the pictures
that chiropractor alvin griffin who sold meeks his steroids he might know where he is
his phones been tapped since meeks escaped
no contact that way so far and hes sure not going to talk to us
what about a warrant to search his house
get me in the door and hell talk to me
hows your divorce going
i took your advice and told my lawyer to settle
stretching out her arm to return the photos none of these is the woman in the van
im sewing up your head here
and your ego can handle that
it doesnt like any of the other choices
until meeks is caught snyder is with you
nothing personal snyder
to lister hes not part of our team
hes there to protect you
and listen to him hes been alive longer than you have
i didnt volunteer for this atwood
the parking lot has a security camera
were checking the tape
if meeks and the woman left in a car well have a license number
you have two days then i want a progress report on your divorce
i think i have all the pieces on the thumbprint killer im just not looking at them the right way
okay you have three days
smiles sweetly at snyder every babysitter i ever had loved me
in the scattering of vehicles mr
brooks toyota is hidden in plain sight in a row of cars
behind the wheel mr
brooks is again wearing his pottery throwing clothes
smith is in the passenger seat and marshall is leaning forward from the back
theyre all focused to varying degrees on the entrance to the store
smith raises his watch for a look at the time
maybe he went home with someone else
can you still see his pickup
this is not the kind of guy who leaves his pickup in an unguarded lot overnight
the silence returns
all three men idly observe an old green pontiac convertible with a frayed top and paint peeling come into the lot and park two spaces away facing them
we saw this car last watching atwood from outside the murder house
the headlights go off
the drivers door opens
the woman who was with meeks in the van steps out and hurries toward the drug store
she of course means nothing to mr
brooks but in the brief seconds the domelight is on he catches sight of the man in the passenger seat
a memory tickles his brain
he turns to marshall
where do we know that guy from
you really should pay more attention to what you read earl
thats what i have you for marshall
his picture was on the front page of the paper a couple days ago because he escaped from jail
hes the killer they call the hangman
remember that cop you like atwood whos chasing us shes the one who put him away
i think his name is thorton meeks
brooks cocks his head at the vague outline of meeks
well well well
what would life be without surprises
smith who remember cannot hear or see marshall straightens up
there he is
the man they are waiting for is coming down the steps of the store
on the way to his pickup he takes off a managers smock
you know whats weird
ill bet he has all these plans of what hes going to do tonight and tomorrow and he doesnt know he will already be dead and wont be able to
do any of them
brooks nods absently
the drug store manager arrives at his truck
i dont think i want to kill this guy
but you promised we would
oh i love what youre thinking
you have no idea what im thinking
oh yes i do and its wonderfully twisted
smith i know i said we would but i dont think it would be that much fun
brooks starts the car and puts it in reverse
so just like that youre saying no its not going to happen
purses his lips into a tight line i see
brooks casts his eyes on the license plate of the car meeks is in
you get the number
i got it
brooks toyota leaves
smith sits stiffly
his expression hasnt changed
smith wants you to notice hes pouting
yeah i know
the toyota is part of the light traffic
the toyota comes into view around a corner and stops next to the sidewalk
i know youre upset mr
smith and im sorry
yeah i am upset
maybe i was a little abrupt back there but let me explain
finding someone you think would be fun to kill is a bit like falling in love
you meet a lot of candidates and you like some of them and theyre nice but theyre not right and then that special one shows up and your heart beats
faster and you know thats the one
the man in the pickup did not make my heart beat faster
okay he did not make your heart beat faster
if not him who
i dont know i think i have someone in mind
do you need me to do any work on it
no lets see how it plays out
thats my problem
that makes me feel like im being jerked around mr
i thought it was happening last night then it was happening tonight
and now its lets see how it plays out
i feel like youre planning to back out on our deal and i dont like that feeling at all
i promise you it will happen
thats what i want to know mr
tomorrow night same time
when you come out of your building turn right go to the first street you can go west on ill pick you up on that street
he gets out and with the door still open turns back
i want to do this
but if it drags on too long i could change my mind
dont you think i want to do this mr
maybe you dont anymore
he shuts the door
marshall and mr
brooks watch him walk away
even if that guy was charming and funny i still wouldnt like him
the toyota u turns makes the corner and is lost from sight
the garage door opens and mr
brooks swings the toyota inside
brooks steps out of the toyota onto a sheet of plastic
two strides away is an industrial vacuum cleaner
brooks vacuums the passenger seat and dash and floor and everything around it
brooks removes his shoes and leaves them on the plastic then slips his feet into paper slippers
with handiwipes he wipes down the outside of the passenger door in fact anything on that side mr
smith could have touched
he opens the door and wipes down the seat and the dash and the console
back on the plastic mr
on top of his clothes he drops the used handiwipes the slippers and the vacuum bag
the corners of the plastic sheet are folded up twisted together and zip tied to create a nice neat package which mr
brooks picks up and takes into the ceramics studio
brooks rinses off the lather under the spray
the glow from degrees fahrenheit is coming through the window of the kiln
the drivers license complete with picture of the woman who was with meeks in the drug store parking lot is up on the computer screen
brooks now back in his regular clothes brings the cursor down to the address
he scores this and drags it into yahoo maps driving directions
a route is generated
brooks brings the cursor up to print and clicks
close on his printer
the map is fed out and settles into the tray
an unmarked police car stops on the gravel of the turn around
two plainclothes detectives get out and walk to the front door
the taller one rings the bell and they wait and then the door is opened by mr
in a flash he takes in the car and the way the men are dressed and although his face doesnt betray it he knows what they are
hi what can i do for you
the shorter one holds up a badge
im detective smolny with the chicago police and this is detective carfagno from palo alto california
showing his badge wed like to speak to jane brooks if thats possible
jane is my daughter whats this about
there was a murder at stanford not long before she left
she may be able to help us
is she a suspect
not at this time
we simply would like to ask her some questions
is your daughter here
the questions wont take long
im sure you would have no objection if she had an attorney present
reaching into his pocket heres my card
we can schedule a time for later today or tomorrow for her to come in to see us
brooks looks at the card
if you gentlemen can wait i will call my lawyer right now and see what we can work out
oh thats even better
opening the door wider would you like some coffee
marshall is walking alongside a very disturbed mr
we both knew she was hiding something bigger i certainly didnt think it was this big
shes not a suspect marshall
she may not have anything to do with it at all
brooks opens a door
the room that is revealed is a very well equipped home gym
in sweats and wearing a walkman emma is working out on an elliptical machine
brooks motions to her that he wants to talk
emma takes off the headphones and pauses the machine
did jane ever tell you that there was a murder at her school
not that a friend died or someone she knew died
or someone in her dorm died
there are two detectives downstairs one is from palo alto they want to ask her some questions about a murder that occurred shortly before she came home
oh my gosh
im sure if she was close to someone who was murdered she would have said something
i called roger he suggested a criminal attorney theyll be here within the hour
ill get dressed
there are now three cars plus the unmarked police car in the turn around
everyone is in the living room
jane is on a couch flanked by her mother and a lawyer
standing behind them is a heavyset lawyer and a young lawyer
weve never seen any of these men before
facing this group from the opposite couch are the two detectives
there are two tape recorders on the coffee table
brooks is in a chair off to one side watching everything
for him the conversation is merely a burble of voices
he studies his daughter while she answers a question
she is unaware of his scrutiny
and finally all he can see are her lips moving
even the burble has faded to silence
the unmarked police car with the two detectives pulls away
we move in on the front door
the lawyers spill out
brooks shakes hands with the lawyer who was sitting on the couch next to jane
clifford it was a pleasure
thank you for coming on such short notice
there wont be any more dropping by like they did today theyll call us first
thanks again roger
it was a good idea to hear what they wanted to know sooner rather than later
he waves and re enters the house
brooks shuts the door and turning finds himself face to face with emma and jane
the women are both worried
he and his daughter look at each other
for a brief instant each one tries to find what they hope to find in the other
brooks smiles and folds the girl into his arms
you did good kid
your answers were clear concise and honest
and when they tried to trip you up it didnt work
i hope so
im not feeling so well
should you lie down
i think id better
brooks kisses his daughter on the top of the head
try and get some sleep
jane bends her steps toward the stairs
to emma i think roger has a handle on this
he and mr
clifford will take care of it
emma takes her husbands hand and after squeezing it follows her daughter
on the stairs jane stops and looks back
im sorry i didnt tell you about it daddy
it was horrible but i really didnt know the guy that well
it happened at about the same time i found out i was pregnant and it just went out of my mind
jane resumes her journey up the stairs
close on a water glass being filled from a tap
god grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change courage to change the things i can and wisdom to know the difference
with a shaky hand mr
brooks raises the glass to his lips
god help me
what do i do
sitting on the island behind him marshall waits for mr
brooks to gulp the glass dry
she did it didnt she
itll take the cops a week to ten days to put their case together and then theyll come back and arrest her
what are you going to do
brooks puts his hands over his eyes and sobs then wiping away the tears ive been afraid of this since the day she was born
she has what i have
yes she does
but youve always been smart about it
she was stupid
she did it because she got off on it she did it for fun
why didnt she think it through
and she left it there
they were pretty graphic werent they
that was to shock her into making a mistake
what does she think i think
doesnt she remember what she told me
that the bmw was being driven across country by a friend and now right in front of me she tells the cops it was stolen
youve always cleaned up after her whatever she did all her life
if the bmw has anything incriminating in it i hope it was stolen or she dropped it at the bottom of a very deep lake
do you think she knows what kind of trouble shes in
i think she thought she had gotten away with it until the cops showed up
i should have listened to her it was there
she was telling me
i didnt quit school because i was pregnant
i should have dug deeper
and where would you be but at the exact same place you are now
it is not your fault earl
part of your problem with her is that you always think it is
she has what i have marshall
so on a very basic level it is my fault
what are you going to do
maybe the best thing for her would be to let her go to jail
and what about her child
emma and i would raise it
you might be right earl you might be
because you know if shes not stopped shes going to do it again
and if she wants to take over the box business the next victim could be you
i dont think shed go that far
a slide of what looks like enlarged grains of sand among giant carpet fibers is projected onto a screen
the lead crime lab technician we found traces of this in two places
the slide changes to an overhead schematic showing the interior of the house where the dance couple was murdered
detective atwood and detective snyder are standing with sigy watching the presentation
atwood has a bandage covering the stitches over her eye
with a laser pointer here and here
the red dot indicates an area just outside the kitchen and just outside the bedroom
we did an analysis and its made up of feldspar alumina and kaolin
a high fire stoneware clay
like you make ashtrays and vases from
this is more plates and teacups
it was slightly wet when whoever it was tracked it into the house and it stuck to the carpet fibers
were thinking it was the killer
it could have been tracked in by a friend
thats the thing you see the friend would have had to have been there almost at the same time the killer was
otherwise the samples would have been dry and the killer would have vacuumed them up
is the clay rare is it difficult to get
you can buy it almost anywhere
thats not much help sigy
and this is the only incongruity you were able to find in the whole house
weve done everything we know how to do
it sure doesnt break the case wide open does it
no sigy it doesnt
it does give me an excuse to ask someone some new questions
brooks is standing behind his desk staring blankly at the contents of his briefcase when sunday his secretary comes in
brooks doesnt immediately answer her hes lost in thought
from the couch before you open your mouth be very sure this is the right thing to do
i will never be sure
remember sunday can neither see nor hear marshall
you get pissed at me because im always the one arguing to go ahead and do murder
not this time earl
this is your decision
i know its wrong
in my heart i know its wrong
then dont do it
go with mr
smith tonight and end that then let the police put jane in jail
hopefully that will save her and we can happily go on with our tortured lives
thats exactly what i want to do
thats exactly what i should do
the thing is shes my daughter and i love her
brooks raises his head and looks at sunday
im going home
cancel everything for the rest of the day
i might be in tomorrow afternoon
ill let you know about that
ill take care of it
if you need me need me call my studio thats where ill be
i probably wont pick up just leave a message
ill try not to bother you
the door closes behind her
with a hidden lever mr
brooks lowers casters under the kiln and rolls it aside to reveal a combination safe imbedded in the concrete floor
he spins the dial opens the safe and extracts four quadruple pocketed plastic sleeves which he lines up in front of himself
each sleeve contains a drivers license two credit cards and cash
the pictures on the drivers licenses are of mr
brooks but you wouldnt immediately recognize him because of the disguises
as hes trying to decide which of the four identities would be best for what he has in mind marshall comes forward to look over his shoulder
the thing that bothers me about this besides the fact were not prepared and a multitude of other things is what does mr
smith do when hes walking west tonight and you dont show up
that little freak could flip out
brooks chooses the first sleeve and the third sleeve
the other two go back into the safe
ill take care of it on the way to the airport
its in an industrial park
smith exits one of the doors and continues on into the parking lot to a moderately expensive foreign car sitting in a space identified by a sign which reads
he squeezes the disarm button on his key chain
the car chirps twice and he opens the door
bending his knees to get in he stops
there is a section of newspaper wedged in the steering wheel
when his brain unlocks he straightens up and moving only the top of his body makes a quick recon of the surrounding area and his back seat
nothing threatening seen he eases into the seat
the door is closed and locked
smith removes the newspaper
it folds open
on the first page there are words circled in red
as his eyes dart from one to the other we go in close on the words and hear mr
brooks say them as mr
smith finds them
not able to meet mr
smith turns the page
tonight do it same turns the page
time tomorrow turns the page
night dont be stupid
smith refolds the newspaper and throws it at the passenger seat
he inserts the key into the ignition
theres a sudden sharp knock
on the drivers window
smith levitates off the seat
unable to breathe he turns
detective atwoods face lowers into view
you remember me
smith can do is nod
would you step out of the car please i want to talk to you
atwood steps back as mr
smith gets out
behind her detective snyder is standing next to the drivers door of an un marked police car which has blocked mr
baffert what is that you have to tell me
what do you mean
i dont have anything to tell you
because i was driving around and i got this sudden feeling that you had something to tell me about the murders
because when i left you the last time we talked i felt i had missed a clue that was right in front of me that would solve this whole case
i dont know why you would feel that
didnt you tell me you were an amateur potter that you made bowls and vases
no i said i was an amateur photographer
are you positive
because we found potters clay on the carpet of the murder house and i was sure you said to me that you worked with clay that you made pots
i said my hobby was photography not pottery
maybe that was it
the stewardess upstairs said the victims kept their curtains open when they made love
could i see some of the pictures you took of that couple
smith can only stare at detective atwood
his adams apple moves up and down though he makes no sound
should he or shouldnt he
finally he throws his arms up in a shrug but in his half turn of indecision he happens to spy the newspaper he tossed at the passenger seat of his
part of it is draped over the console
the red circles around the words on that page jump out at him
dont be stupid
smith returns his attention to detective atwood
you are harassing me detective atwood
you know very well im not a potter and i dont have any pictures
so my feeling is that your feeling is wrong and that you should move your car and let me go home
what is your job here
what do you do
im a mechanical engineer
you have to be pretty smart for that dont you
then be smart mr
you lied to me right there at the end
ill be watching you
and when you want to tell me the truth you know how to get in touch with me
she gives him a dazzling smile
see you later alligator
atwood walks back to her car and gets in
under her breath goddamit
as snyder accelerates away he points to the cars computer screen
captain lister got us the search warrant for meeks chiropractor
shakes her head no frustrated goddamit
that guy knows something
smith he almost told me and then something happened
you think he did it
i dont think its that simple
smith watches the unmarked police car going away and wipes the sweat out of his hairline
were following a stewardess down the aisle
she stops at a row and leans over to hand a glass of tomato juice to the person in the window seat
here you are sir
brooks who now looks like the man in the picture on the third drivers license accepts the drink
he takes a sip and resumes his gaze out the window
almost inaudible whisper god grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change courage to change the things i can and wisdom to know the difference
the earth that he is looking at below is a long way away
come off a sign which reads stanford university miles to an alamo rental car traveling south on the el camino real
in his pottery throwing clothes mr
brooks is behind the wheel
theres an ace hardware store bag sitting upright and open on the passenger seat
we peek over the edge of the bag
a brand new hatchet with a gleaming blade sits at the bottom
brooks adjusts the rearview mirror
marshall is on the passenger side of the back seat
youre awfully quiet back there
without any indication hes been addressed marshall continues to stare stoically ahead
the alamo rental car carrying mr
brooks continues on
theres barely enough ambient light to see that we are close on the knob of the front door
from outside we hear the muffled sound of a black decker cordless drill and the knob begins to vibrate
someone is drilling the lock
the sound stops
the knob turns
the door opens
a flashlight is shone into our face
alvin griffin this is the chicago police
from the protection of the doorjamb a very young uniformed policeman is the person shining the flashlight into the house
hes flanked on either side of the door by detective atwood and detective snyder
the officers flashlight illuminates a short entryway with a hall immediately off to the left and the living room fading into darkness straight ahead
continues we have a warrant to search your home and premises
were coming in
flashlight in her left hand and the glock in her right detective atwood is the first one across the threshold
she directs the beam at the wall next to the door finds the light switch
lights dont work
she continues to the hall
the darkness is so oppressive there it seems that her stream of light must struggle to pierce it
the room at the end is the kitchen
with snyder hanging in the entryway to protect her back atwood eases the hand with the flashlight around the corner
the dishwasher the sink the cabinets gleam dully back at her
she steps inside
a debris field of empty pharmaceutical boxes and vials trails away from the refrigerator
her flashlight sweeps the rest of the room
beyond an open countertop in the dining area the light blurs past an oval of white and then comes back
its the face of a woman
careful of the litter atwood moves forward until she can see that the woman is sitting in a chair at the far end of the dining table
her throat has been cut
her head is being held upright by her hair which is taped to the back of the chair
she has a pen taped between her fingers but the appointment book in front of her is drenched in blood
calls to the darkness in back of her we have a dead woman in here
a light and footsteps hurry toward her from the living room
atwood swings her light at them
he squints and turns away
i thought you were behind me
the living room is clean
atwood swings her light back onto the dead woman
the combined illumination of the flashlights cause the support joists twelve feet up to throw eerie shadows onto the open ceiling
snyder meet mona
the uniformed policeman comes up beside atwood
i called it in
the smell of blood and the sight of the carnage is too much for him
his gorge rises and he gags
do that outside
the officer doesnt have to be told twice
to snyder re the body meeks did this
i thought meeks hung people
atwood retraces her steps in the kitchen
meeks is a steroid freak
this refrigerator was always full of steroids
mona was alvin griffins niece receptionist lover and keeper of the keys
she focuses her flashlight on an open padlock dangling from a steel band that runs around the refrigerator
with the barrel of the glock she opens the door
the only edibles inside are a tomato half a loaf of bread a package of hotdogs and some part of a chicken in a kfc box
the rest of the space is vacant
well the steroids are certainly gone
you think meeks has alvin with him
meeks thinks alvin turned him in
she shuts the refrigerator
lets go see whats in the rest of the house
atwood and her flashlight pass us
three feet to her right and slightly behind is snyder and his flashlight
the two detectives are leaving the living room and entering the hall toward the bedrooms
the ceiling is low here and it feels very claustrophobic
ahead is a door painted red
but before they get to it theres a room on the right
snyder shines his light in
its a bathroom
the shower curtain is open
nobody in the tub
the door ahead is waiting but theres another door on the right
snyder shines his light in
this one is a treatment room with a therapy table and shelves of oils and unguents
theyve come to the red door
atwood will open this one
she turns the knob and pushes
the door is stuck
she and snyder exchange a look
snyder shuffles back half a step and flattens himself against the wall
he shuts off his flashlight
atwood takes a deep breath levers her weight against the door and pushes
theres a sudden snap
then the door swings freely open
the beam of atwoods flashlight reveals a large room containing a bed a dresser a
the sound is coming from up in the rafters
atwood whips her flashlight in that direction
for an instant the beam catches a piece of a large shape falling fast right at her
then its lost in the darkness and then picked up again in the reflected light in the hall
the shape is a naked man
the man nails atwood in the shoulder
her gun goes off
she bounces into the wall and onto her ass
barely slowed the man continues in an upward arc
his feet and knees slam into the ceiling
plaster dust rains
the man swings back past snyder
hes lost in the darkness again
then he swings back into the light and comes to a stop just inside the bedroom door
the man is hanging from a rope around his neck
his body is festooned with syringes stuck into his bare flesh
in fact two of the needles hold a sheet of paper to the mans chest
printed on the paper in big black letters are the words getting to her feet snyder this is alvin griffin
the gray of dawn is in the sky
brooks wearing a disguise that makes him look like the picture on the drivers license in the first plastic sleeve gets into a taxi
the cab drops mr
brooks off in front of a house
brooks watches the cab drive away and then with his carry on bag starts walking in the opposite direction
he turns a corner
still on foot mr
brooks arrives at his non descript toyota
there are also neighborhood cars parked along the street
brooks unlocks his car and throws his carry on onto the passenger seat
brooks toyota speeds up an on ramp and joins the light traffic
from the back seat marshall watches mr
brooks remove the pieces of his disguise a wig a mustache glasses and drop them in the carry on
how do you feel
youve never killed for this reason before
the feeling will go away
i dont think so
its the whole thing marshall
if i could find a way to just disappear where there was absolutely no trace of me because eventually i will get caught doing this
and itll be very embarrassing for me and emma and jane
so ive been thinking
is there a way that mr
smith could kill me and make me disappear
number one mr
smith is not smart enough to do that
number two there is no reason if youre careful to believe you will ever get caught
i know i will have to plan it for mr
smith but i think thats what i want to do
im not particularly fond of that plan earl
remember if you die i go with you and i like being alive
i like eating i like fucking i like killing
i have to end it marshall
one way or the other
and i think this is the best way
well fuck you then
long ago this was a nice area
a banner hangs from an old deco building rooms for rent
brooks is walking through the parking lot beside the building
there as a first car in a double space is the old green pontiac convertible
its blocked in by another car
brooks sidles between the cars to check the license plate against the one in his memory
its the car thorton meeks was in outside the drug store
brooks walks away
brooks opens the kiln door and removes three pieces embellished with a beautiful yellow glaze
he sets them on a table then takes his carry on bag and places it in a ceramic trough which he puts into the kiln
the door is shut
flame erupts from the gas jets
the bathroom door opens
brooks in his pajamas turns out the light and crosses to the bed
emma looks up as he pulls back the covers and gets in
you worked all night
i had ideas for pots that took too long and the clay kept winning
he kisses her ill be fine
and theres a yellow chinese glaze im trying to get right
he lays his head on the pillow and is almost instantly asleep
reflected in the glass of an open mirrored closet door is a tastefully furnished den with floor to ceiling windows that look out at lake michigan from the th floor
an empty suitcase falls into this picture and bounces on the carpet
behind the mirrored door detective atwood is atop a stepstool rummaging through the suitcases on the highest shelf
throughout the condo there is an incessant ringing of the phones
another suitcase goes down and atwood finds what shes looking for a framed color x photo of her husband jesse
hes in a business suit and holding some kind of trophy
the phones stop ringing
atwood comes down the stepstool folds it and is carrying it back to where it lives when the phones start ringing again
she picks up a cordless in the den
the asian attorney interrupts her sip of coffee
hi tracy this is nancy tang
we received a counter offer
are you sitting down
yeah go ahead
he cant get that can he
intercut with nancy
no my sense of it is by asking for five theyre hoping youll settle anywhere between two five and three
how long can you stall them
they know you want this done quickly so theyre going to expect a quick counter offer
i need two days
wait two days before getting back to them
if they call tell them its a big number im thinking about it
and the picture he wanted
she slams the frame of jesses photo against the inside of a metal trash can
nancy winces and then smiles at the sound of shattering glass
atwood plucks the photo out of the frame and tears it so that the rip can be heard over the phone
tell him i couldnt find it
brooks is still asleep
emma dressed for the day arrives at his side of the bed
she rubs the back of mr
brooks opens his eyes
sleepy groggy huh
roger is on the phone
in his slippers and robe mr
brooks is standing in the doorway watching jane who is leaning over the counter with an open newspaper next to a bowl of cereal
he has a chance to take a good long look before she feels his presence and raises her head
oh hi daddy i thought youd already be gone
there was another murder last night near stanford
done the same way as the one they talked to you about
right down to the hatchet being left at the scene
jane cant quite conceal the tremor of surprise that ripples through her and mr
brooks sees it
they think they have a serial killer
obviously you were here last night so youre in the clear
thats good news isnt it
i mean even if youre innocent its good news to know youre not a suspect
hows the morning sickness
do you want to ride in with me today
i feel fine but i dont know how long that will last
brooks nods turns to leave then turns back
do you love me jane
of course i love you daddy youre my father
have you decided whether or not to keep the baby
looking off the grill as it overtakes another car in the fastlane
eminem is on the stereo
the car ahead moves out of the way
smith is rapping along to cleanin out my closet
he knows all the words
with eminem fading we fall behind mr
one car two cars
the third car is detective atwoods car
atwood is driving
snyder is in the passenger seat
what are we doing
are we there yet
are we there yet
you sound like a child
were playing a hunch
weve been following this guy all day hes boring and everything we run on him comes up clean
if it didnt it wouldnt be called a hunch
meeks finger prints were all over the chiropractor the note refrigerator hes the guy we should be looking for
please tell me
everyone knows who meeks is and is looking for him
the chiropractor was the last link to his old life that i know of
the only way well find him now is if someone turns him in or we trip over him at a bus stop
on the other hand detective snyder no one knows who the thumbprint killer is or where he is
however i have a fucking hunch this guy baffert does
i have two days to play that hunch
if you feel like youre wasting your time with me id be happy to do it alone
he looks at her and shakes his head
i had a fight with my wife this morning whats your problem
my husband wants five million dollars
smiths car enters the parking lot of a rib joint
atwoods car stops across the street
atwood and snyder watch mr
smith enter the restaurant
they wait in silence
a muted tone announces the arrival of an email on their computer
snyder reads and frowns
lister is pulling you off this case
maybe they caught him
she twists the screen around so she can read the message
she would have said that
snyder points across the street at mr
smith coming out of the restaurant carrying a take out bag
you want to keep following him
lister only said you were off the case not me
smiles good thinking tonto
she starts the car
theres the muted tone again
atwood looks at the computer screen
she just ed you too
trailed by snyder detective atwood arrives at captain listers secretary
is she in
shes with someone
atwood blows past the secretary and opens the door to listers office
there are two men in suits on the other side of the desk from the captain
atwood ignores them and focuses on lister
you promised if i settled my divorce i had three days on the thumbprint killer
i have the rest of today and tomorrow left
detective atwood meet fbi agents longnecker and campbell theyre taking over your investigation
you promised you would keep them out of it for three days
they wont allow me to keep that promise
atwood glares at her then at the fbi men
this is my case what youre doing is fucked
but since i cant stop you and she wont heres a tip
james baffert you should stake him out he knows something
we have some other ideas we are looking into
then whats the problem
you do that and ill tail baffert
thank you for all your good work detective
this is our case now
atwood looks from one man to the other
to captain lister later i suppose youll fill me in on what im supposed to be doing around here
snyder closes the door behind her
its deserted with only a small spill of light coming from mr
brooks is at his desk
the lamp at his elbow throws a yellow cone across his face
his head is in his hands hes been crying
marshall steps out of the shadows behind him
its time to go
he reaches into a bottom drawer and as he takes out an envelope marshall reads the tear stained hand written letter resting on the blotter
dear emma and jane my loves i have a terminal illness and instead of subjecting you to my deterioration i have decided to disappear
dont try to find me i dont want to be found
please believe that the time i spent with you brought me the greatest joy of my life
brooks picks up the letter and folds it
so youre going to go through with it
brooks stuffs the letter in the envelope seals it and picks up a pen
its all planned to work out marshall
on the envelope he writes for emma and jane
on the sidewalk mr
smith is walking toward the on coming traffic
the headlights make it difficult to tell one car from the other until they pass
that doesnt keep him from looking for mr
the houses stop and hes passing a pocket park
in a dark space between the street lamps a hand falls on mr
he jumps and a scream squeaks out of his throat
brooks in his pottery throwing clothes
smiles are you ready to rock and roll mr
smith swallows hard and nods
brooks propels him into the park
brooks is driving
smith is in the passenger seat
both are lost in a wary silence
abruptly from the back seat i smell gun oil a gun oil thats different than yours
he brought his gun
after he gets what he wants he plans to kill me
now i get it
you were counting on that werent you
it has a certain logic
but if your plan is to have him kill you why do you have to kill someone else first
hell need to see that to get up the courage to kill me
marshall roars with laughter
not even you believe that earl
it makes it more exciting doesnt it to think hes going to kill you after you kill someone else
youre getting your rocks off big time thats why youre doing it
and if it were so what
smith youre goddamn great you know
to have the balls to do this
im pretty nervous but thats normal right
atwood is propped up in bed reading a magazine
her hair is pulled back and her face glistens with cold cream
the phone rings
should she answer it
it rings again then again
reluctantly she grabs the receiver
oh yes yes
she sits up put him through
hi this is detective atwood speaking thanks for calling
yes your roommate said you were in tokyo
anything if you saw anything at all it might be helpful
a man in a flight attendants uniform is standing at the window of the apartment he shares with the stewardess
a cordless phone to his ear he is looking down at the house where the dance couple was murdered
the weird thing is that they closed their curtains at first they were open like they always were and they were making love which they always did and then when
i looked again the curtains were closed and there were what looked like camera flashes coming from behind the curtains
intercut with detective atwood
thats what it looked like
almost to herself thats why he poses them
i wish i could be more helpful i didnt see the killer or anything like that but since it was weird i thought i should call
youve been very helpful
this answers a lot of questions for me
thank you very much mr
shes about to hang up when struber speaks again
the guy you should talk to is the guy on the floor below us
eh i cant remember his name but he told me once that hed taken some great pictures of that couple making love hes the one you should speak to
would that be mr
yeah i think jim or james
thank you very much
atwood disconnects then quickly dials
snyder meet me at bafferts apartment with a search warrant
listen to me this is what you tell the judge
coming up the back stairs we arrive at a landing and make a right
in front of us is mr
smith watching mr
brooks pick the deadbolt in the service door
brooks straightens up twists the handle and pushes the door inward
its caught by a chain
he takes the bent rubber tipped forceps from one pocket from another he hands mr
smith a pair of latex gloves
put these on
in the middle of the large darkened kitchen mr
brooks pauses to listen to the sounds of the apartment
the gun with the silencer is already in his right hand
both are encased in a ziplock bag
beside him mr
smith is wide eyed with fear and anticipation
his teeth are even chattering
try a couple deep breaths through your nose
i have to take a crap so bad
this wont take long
brooks and mr
smith come out of the kitchen
the living room is quite well appointed
theres a fire going in the fireplace
the sound of a t
is coming from a room off a hall up ahead
that is where mr
brooks and mr
smith are headed
theyre more than half way across the living room when ding
the doorbell rings
smith gasps and looks beseechingly at mr
without an ounce of hurry mr
brooks maneuvers him back into the shadows of the kitchen
the doorbell rings again
a wet spot appears in mr
smiths crotch and runs down his pant leg
pee drips onto the linoleum
a man comes out of the hallway
the living room light goes on
the man is jesse detective atwoods estranged husband
he opens the front door
the woman who comes in is sheila his divorce lawyer
they kiss tongues
his hands brush over her breasts
he begins to unbutton her blouse
the kiss breaks
as he continues unbuttoning
i called your wifes lawyer
theyre thinking about the five million dollars
jesse opens the blouse and looks at the breasts under the bra
realistically how much do you think we can get
sheila gives him a quick kiss and moves on into the living room where she drops her briefcase on the couch
if we go to court best case two if she wants to settle best case three but i would be happy with two seven
backlit by the fireplace jesse kisses her again
from the kitchen mr
brooks and mr
smith watch jesse unzip sheilas slacks and dropping to his knees peel them off her legs
she steps out of them
he kisses the inside of her thighs her crotch then standing up ill be right back
on his way out of the living room i think we should hold firm for three
he shuts off the light
in the glow of the fireplace sheila removes her jacket
lets not be piggish two five two seven would be a good deal
jesse returns with a partially full glass of champagne
he hands sheila a glass from a side table takes a bottle out of an ice bucket and as he fills her glass teasing youve already had half a bottle
youre late if we want it theres more
they clink glasses
to three million dollars
after a sip we have to do this fast because remember marie is meeting us here
we could ask her to join us
undoing the front of her bra i wasnt trying to be
she bops him playfully
he bends and slips a nipple into his mouth
sheila bites her lip and moans
in the kitchen mr
smith shifts around for a better view
the floor under him crreeekks
in the living room both sheila and jesse react to the sound
are we alone
brooks seems to appear magically out of the darkened kitchen with his gun raised
hes followed by mr
sheila opens her mouth to scream
dont do that
detective atwood hurries down the hall and out of breath stops in front of mr
she raps sharply
waits a bare three seconds and raps again
the door of the apartment behind her opens and an older woman sticks her head out
atwood shows her badge
do you have any idea when hell be back
he skipped out
i heard him leave this evening and a few minutes later there were movers here
musta been behind on the rent
he didnt even say good bye
as the old lady watches atwood tries the knob
she pushes the door open
the hallway and living room she can see are completely empty
camera equipment art gone
i told you
on her way in atwood draws her gun
keeping close to the walls she audits the kitchen
all the cabinet doors are open
dishes pots and pans cutlery gone
she moves on to the bathroom
soap shampoo toilet paper toothpaste toothbrushes towels washcloths the contents of the medicine cabinet gone
she moves on to the bedroom
bed night table lamps t
clothes closets empty of everything
she looks around
smiths entire apartment has been stripped absolutely clean except
theres a crumpled piece of paper in the far corner of the bedroom
atwood goes over and gets down on one knee
with her fingers pulling at the corners she is able to straighten the paper enough to make out that its a work order from a moving company
reading it with the paper pinched between thumb and forefinger of her left hand atwood rises
theres the silhouette of a man in the doorway behind her
obviously bafferts gone
atwood whirls gun up
she sees that its snyder
overlapping goddamit snyder
i wasnt able to get the search warrant
we may have gotten lucky
holding up the paper this is the moving companys work order and
points it looks like this is the address where theyre taking bafferts stuff
where were you when you called me
at home in bed
can you prove that
i was home in bed why should i have to prove that
your husband jesse and his lawyer were killed tonight
atwood slowly lowers her head and fixes her eyes on the floor in stunned silence
it looks like the thumbprint killer ive been ordered to bring you in for questioning
why i didnt want jesse dead i loved him i hated what he was doing to me
its on record you said youd like him dead and who better to fake a thumbprint killing than you
you cant actually believe i would do that
if our jobs have taught us anything tracy is that people do strange things
they just want to ask you some questions
i will be happy to answer any questions after we check out this address
atwood goes to leave the room
snyder blocks her way
i have to take you in tracy
waves the paper this is the answer to the thumbprint killer snyder and this is where im going and youre not going to stop me
dont make me cuff you tracy because i will if i have to
atwood smiles winningly
i believe you would
smiles back you can count on it
snyder never sees it coming
atwoods right cross nails him exactly where the jaw meets the neck and down he goes on his ass
standing over him it would be nice if you could come with me but if you do and it goes bad theyll burn your ass
so this never happened
brooks car speeds under an overpass
that was great
it was fantastic
it was everything i hoped it would be
in the back seat here comes the gun
without taking his eyes off the road
smith slides a pistol from under his jacket and points it at mr
feigns surprise what are you doing
youre smart enough to figure that out mr
well were going sixty five miles an hour mr
smith if you shoot me now theres a good chance well both die
take the next off ramp
that wouldnt be very smart of me would it
he accelerates around a truck into the fastlane
smith can see the exit coming up its quickly left behind
matter of fact think about this
you pissed yourself back there you left your dna at the scene of a double homicide and theres nothing to indicate that i was ever there
if the cops do an analysis of that urine and they will youre the thumbprint killer
i still have pictures of you doing the first murder
brooks smiles a knowing smile
beyond him on the other side of the divider cars are zipping by in the opposite direction
but what were you doing at the second murder
smith doesnt have an answer for that
let me help you with a thought
you say i forced you to come along and if im not here or more specifically my body is not here to say different you might have a chance to
beat the rap
now youre probably asking yourself why i would help you
im tired mr
smith im tired of killing
but im an addict i cant quit
i cant do it on my own
so ill let you kill me but i want you to do it smart in a way that i disappear and my family never knows what i was
how do i do that
theres a cemetery i know about
we find an open grave you shoot me i fall in the grave you shovel in just enough earth to cover me tomorrow a casket is lowered onto me and
its a good plan
what do you say
why should i trust you
you dont have to trust me
youre the man holding the gun you saw me put mine in the trunk
i dont know
you really want me to kill you
but any sudden moves and youre dead on the spot and ill make sure your family knows what you are
come off the banner hanging across the front rooms for rent to find atwood walking away from her car
to herself regarding the building youve come down in the world mr
high ceilings once grand now blue neon and a cage around the front desk to protect the night clerk who is nowhere in sight
somewhere a radio is playing salsa music loud
atwood crosses to the elevator
she pushes the call button
with an arthritic rattle the door opens
atwood selects the th floor
the door closes and after a stuttering liftoff the car begins its ascent
the overhead light flickers on and off
atwood looks up at it
brooks leads mr
smith across a street to a pedestrian gate set in a high wall
through the bars of the gate we can see a cemetery bathed in moonlight
brooks reaches into his pocket
smith tightens his grip on the gun
uh uh take your hand out real slow
brooks does as hes told
a key dangles from his fingers
you dont want to climb over do you
what are you doing with a key to a cemetery
i own it
why do you own a cemetery
brooks unlocks the gate and preceding mr
smith goes inside
you always want to invest in things people cant do without
water and cemeteries are pretty safe
he locks the gate and handing the key to mr
youll need this to get out
now there should be an open grave around here somewhere
lets see if we can find it
he produces a small flashlight from his pocket and off they go
repeating their arthritic performance the elevator doors open
atwood steps out into a wide sporadically lit hallway
peering at the numbers atwood goes to her left
in the middle of the hall behind her a couple exits a room and drifts to the other side of the hall on their way to the elevator
atwood re checks the number on the moving companys work order shes going the wrong way
she turns around
now atwood and the couple are walking toward each other on opposite sides of the hall
atwood steps into an area of light
the reflection off her face catches the attention of the man who is wearing a wide brimmed hat
he lifts his head
its thorton meeks
the woman with him was the driver of the van
shes wearing a watchcap
meeks gently takes his companions arm
her eyes go to where hes looking and then back to his
at some unspoken signal they both draw their guns
intent on finding and baffert the couple hasnt registered on atwoods radar
a chunk of plaster blows off the wall next to her head
startled atwood winces away
the woman fires
the slug explodes the plaster on the other side of atwoods head
now atwood is turning toward them gun in hand
the bullet passes through atwoods jacket
instinctively atwood assumes a classic duelists pose offering the smallest target possible
calmly she squeezes off her first shot
the plaster explodes from the wall above meeks head
the woman fires
a hole appears in atwoods sleeve
atwood pulls the trigger again
the woman screams and falls back into meeks a bullet in her hip
atwoods third shot takes the hat off meeks head
she now realizes who her attackers are
dragging the woman in the direction of the stairs bang
maybe its his broken trigger finger that affects his aim
the shots miss
the woman fires
atwoods next two shots miss
meeks and the woman arrive at the stairs and before rounding the corner bang
fire at atwood who is now moving deliberately at them
atwood doesnt try and dodge the bullets or flinch away from them and her shots are unhurried
the next one catches the woman in the side
the one after that nails meeks in the left shoulder
hes spun into the woman
leaning on each other meeks and the woman lurch down the worn marble steps
atwood reaches the stairs and cheats a look around the corner
from the landing below meeks and the woman fire
atwood steps out from behind the wall and shoulders square shoots
this shot shatters meeks knee
he bellows in pain
moving to the side again atwood shoots
but meeks knee has collapsed and he and the woman are already tumbling down the next set of steps
theres silence then the murmur of voices
calls out atwood
come on down theres something i want to show you
gun at the ready atwood edges her way downward
at about the tenth step she is able to lean over and look through the banisters
meeks and the woman are propping themselves up against the wall on the landing below
both of them still have their guns
the moment meeks eyes meet atwoods he puts his gun to the woman heads
atwood sucks in her breath
meeks puts the gun to his temple
atwood clasps a hand to her mouth and exhales in ragged gulps
the finger of light from mr
brooks handtorch discovers a freshly dug grave
there we are
now if i stand here
he positions himself at one end of the grave
and you stand there not too far away and you shoot me i should fall straight back into the hole
you dont think i have the guts to do this do you
im hoping you do
brooks shuts off his light and straightens up
okay lets get this over with
smith raises his gun and points it at mr
ill close my eyes
smith pulls the trigger
smith looks in horror at the malfunctioning gun
brooks opens his eyes
smith aims the gun again
as he talks he counters around until mr
smith is the one with his back to the open grave
i really did want you to kill me
but in case at the last minute i changed my mind i returned to your apartment and bent the firing pin on your gun
he wrenches the shovel out of a mound of waiting earth
smith tries to fire the gun at mr
in fact i even brought another gun for you so you could finish me if i had decided to go through with it
he opens his jacket and shows mr
smith the gun
unfortunately for you my daughter is pregnant and just before you pulled the trigger i realized how much i want to see the end to that story
dry mouth if you do anything to me if you touch one hair on my head the police will find the pictures of you killing that couple
the contents of your safety deposit box mr
smith have vanished
without warning mr
brooks swings the shovel
the force of the blow breaks mr
smiths left arm
the next blow comes almost immediately
it smashes into the left side of mr
the screams stop and a misfiring set of neurons causes mr
smith to stand up straight and wobbling look directly at mr
the blood streaming down his face is black in the moonlight
brooks takes a step to the side cocks his wrists and swings again
his full weight is behind this one
the blade of the shovel strikes mr
smith in the throat very nearly taking off his head
the flesh that was once mr
smith falls to the ground
looking down at the corpse before i was the thumbprint killer mr
smith i killed a lot of people in a lot of different ways
smiths body is rolled over the edge
it falls on top of us
brooks takes a shovel of dirt from the pile and whistling by the light of the silvery moon begins the task of covering mr
a newspaper is lying unfolded on the counter next to the remnants of a breakfast
the headline reads nationwide manhunt for thumbprint killer under that headline is a large picture of mr
smith aka mr
in the lower right corner is another headline to a story murder suicide for the hangman
the reader of the paper is mr
on a stool next to him marshall is also reading
it says here the thumbprint killer is a monster
annoys you a little bit that you cant take credit doesnt it
anyone who is good at what they do wants recognition
but since im not going to do it anymore ill let mr
smith take the credit
dont kid yourself earl youre going to kill again
no im not
ill continue the aa meetings and ill control it
on the other stool next to mr
brooks is a woman
her large purse hangs open from the back of the stool the cel phone clearly visible inside
brooks looks at the phone
but there is an answer i would like to have
detective atwood is seated in her cubicle reading the same front page mr
brooks was reading
a fellow officer stops in the door
good work atwood
he moves on
from off screen you should ask the fbi to kiss your ass and buy you a cadillac
i like my ass too much for that
snyder comes in and holds up the work order from the moving company
this is bogus
the company doesnt exist in the city the state the united states or canada
so the whole point of this piece of paper was to give me meeks
thats what it looks like
who moved him where did they move him to and why did he give me meeks
thats what we get paid to find out
atwood picks up the newspaper
im going to go to the bathroom and think about this
the phone rings
she answers it
looking out at the city mr
brooks speaks into the cel phone he stole from the woman
why are you a cop
intercut with atwood
who is this
youre rich you have a good education you could have gone into your fathers business instead you went outside all of that and became successful on your own
you want something from me if you dont tell me who you are im going to hang up
did you think your husbands killing was random and i certainly didnt have to give you meeks
snyder perks up
she points for him to get on the other line
whats the answer
you dont sound like you
i have a little cold
are you going to give me the answer
where are you
ill tell you if you can give me the true answer to my question
detective atwood weighs her options and decides to go for it
my father was very disappointed i was born a girl and he let me know that
ive spent my whole life trying to prove him wrong
you promised to tell me where you are
im on top of a building
atwood and snyder hear the click as mr
brooks hangs up
why would he be interested in that
at the parking structure mr
brooks holds the phone over the edge and drops it
we follow the phone down down down until it hits the pavement and disintegrates
everything is as it was
in his robe and pajamas mr
brooks is standing in front of the open refrigerator gazing blankly at the contents with a glass of milk in one hand
theres nothing he wants in here
he closes the door
carrying the glass of milk mr
brooks passes janes room
the door is ajar
he stops backs up and looks
his daughters asleep
brooks walks to the bed and leans over to give her a kiss on the cheek
his lips have just brushed her flesh when she twists violently under him and stabs upward with a pair of scissors
the blades are driven deep into his throat
brooks jerks back the milk flies out of his hand
he grabs at the handle of the scissors but his blood makes them too slippery
he cant pull them out
honey earl earl
brooks is tossing in his sleep next to emma
she has a hold of his arm
wake up wake up
on the pillow mr
brooks eyes fly open
you were having a nightmare
breathing hard oh
i woke you up
she kisses him on the forehead
im here go back to sleep im here
taking his hand she lies back down
after a moment mr
brooks turns over on his side and looks directly at us
his lips begin to move but we cant hear what hes saying so we move in on his face
its not until it fills our view that we can hear the words
that i may be reasonably happy in this life and supremely happy with him forever in the next
god grant me the serenity to accept
