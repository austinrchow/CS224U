autumnal streets seen through the sooty glass of a street lamp
shadows within shadows
fog in the air
the year was
london was the capital of the world the height of modernity with the hiss of steam and smell of coal in the air
it was also the great cesspool into which all the sinners and criminals of the empire drained
gas hisses audibly the street lamp ignites and casts a pool of light onto the street silhouetting a man making his way through the fog and dark shadows with a
i had come to london ten years prior to find a life after the afghan war
i had hoped to start a medical practice and settle into a nice steady existence
the life i found was anything but nice and steady
we can see that the man wears a cape
the distinctive silhouette of his deerstalker hat is unmistakable
a furious clatter of hooves approaches in the distance
the man tugs on a pipe and turns towards the growing stampede
and that had everything to do with one man
my friend my partner my burden
the man exhales a plume of smoke calmly giving us the impression that he knows something that we dont
the man in the deerstalker hat is knocked flat by a running man who has vaulted over a wall sending him his pipe and hat flying across the cobbles
the running man leans down as if to assist but instead just picks up the smokers broken umbrella and studies it
the man in the deerstalker hats eyes widen as he recognizes his famous assailant
sherlock holmes offers the handle of the umbrella to the man hauls him to his feet and hands back his broken umbrella
send the bill to john watson b baker street
sherlock holmes sprints off down an alleyway
the man takes a step into the road to watch him go and is nearly flattened for good by the first of a number of police carriages hurtling by on
a serious pursuit victorian style
big uniformed guys assemble their weaponry a th century swat team
one man stands out as a leader older than the rest inspector lestrade
a man in plainclothes sits to one side of the officers dr
john watson physically as tough as anyone else in the carriage but with a more pensive air about him
a thinking man of action
almost tipping over the carriage turns onto the embankment and hurtles through the writhing fog along the river
as the carriage banks we see holmes cut across the carriage path again taking a line the horses cannot follow
holmes bursts out of an alley sprints round a corner and runs across a courtyard to a side door
we pull back to see the facade of st
holmes enters through the door and stands at the top of a stairwell
he takes a moment to recover hes fit but not as fit as he used to be
holmes descends the stairwell to a door and a spiral staircase beyond it
he stops at the doorway and peers round the corner
a lantern glow ascends the spiral stairway towards holmes
holmes withdraws into the shadows behind the door
a bowler hatted man ascends the stairs carrying the lantern and a gun
he peers behind the door and holds the lantern up to the shadows but does not see holmes who has pulled his black jacket up to conceal his face
the man swings the lantern away again
he peers about confused
we see holmes eyes from the shadows as he lowers his jacket and thinks through his plan of attack
head cocked to the left partial deafness in right ear
first point of attack
focus on the spot behind the mans right ear just at the top of the jaw the most vulnerable point
holmes launches a hammer blow and we ramp from fps to fps ultra slow motion as he makes contact
the mans head is thrown back as he spins round
then throat paralyze vocal chords stop screaming
back to fps
the mans mouth opens to cry out
we ramp back up to fps as his adams apple is struck with a precision karate chop strangling his scream
stink of alcohol heavy drinker knuckles to liver
back to fps ramping to fps as a devastating knuckle punch to the liver doubles up the bowler hatted thug and crumples him to his knees
holmes flashes out of the shadows moving so fast that we can barely see what hes doing
hammer blow to ear
karate chop to throat
knuckle punch to liver
back to normal motion as the man crumples to the ground holmes takes his bowler hat from his head and flips it onto his own in one super fast move
holmes drags the battered man into the shadows lifts his lantern and proceeds down the spiral staircase
another bowler hatted thug approaches the bottom of the staircase
he has seen the lantern light
he draws his gun and approaches
holmes places the lantern on the post at the bottom of the bannister ducks down into the shadows
whats goin on john
when he gets no answer the thug points his gun to where we saw holmes hide
but holmes appears from the shadows behind the thug reaches around him grabs his gun hand and pistol whips him twice with his own gun dropping him
holmes extracts a cigar from the thugs top pocket and sniffs it appreciatively
hhhmm good cigar
who do you work for
he jams the cigar in his own top pocket picks up the mans bowler and proceeds on further down into the crypts
two hard men in bowler hats stand guard
holmes surveys the scene at a distance out of sight
eyes alive with intelligence processing angles when a heavy hand falls on his shoulder
pull back to reveal the following exchange in whispers
just got it
getting his troops in formation
is that your blood or theirs
i dont know
its an old shirt
you left this behind
watson hands him his pistol
holmes looks at it with distaste doesnt take it
knew id forgotten something
thought id left the stove on
this is what they do
this is what they like
the two hard men on guard turn fast and gather together as they hear footsteps approaching
he can see the hat but not the man underneath
watson takes out the two men
he is more of a brawler using headbutts knees and elbows
less artful but no less effective
thugs dispatched holmes and watson look down and see a chilling sight
five sided figure lit with candles at each corner
her eyes roll back in her head trance like
a sword has been placed at her feet
a hooded figure kneels inside a double circle next to the pentacle
this is lord blackwood
we do not yet see his face
another hooded figure stands on the edge of the ceremony shrouded in shadow
we do not see his face
suddenly the woman rises up like a broken puppet as if pulled to her feet by invisible hands
some kind of ritual is about to climax
holmes and watson head down fast not caring if they make a noise or not
their footsteps echo
the second hooded figure moves back and melts into the shadows
still kneeling still hooded blackwood chants softly latin incantation repeating and repeating
on the woman as her lips start to move in time with the incantation
this is spooky real powerful stuff
holmes and watson leap from the stairs to blackwoods level
blackwood simply ignores them
the latin incantation never stops
holmes is closer to the girl watson closer to blackwood
the girl bends with alarming and mechanical suddenness picks up the sword and turns it on herself ready to plunge the point into her heart
holmes lunges grabs the womans arm disarms her and pulls her out of the pentacle
simultaneously and eerily the candles extinguish and a rush of air departs the tunnel
blackwood throws back his hood
we finally see his face
his eyes are intense he is tapped into something dark and cruel
holmes and watson are shocked at his identity
blackwood applauds softly strangely
well done holmes
and watson as well
watson raises his gun trains it on blackwood
stay right there
blackwood raises his hands in front of him almost mockingly
tell me doctor as a medical man how did you like my work
beat the fifth one was so scrawny it was over before id finished the first incision
thats more than watson can take
he moves in to pistol whip blackwood is stopped suddenly by holmes hand grabbing his collar
watson struggles forward against holmes grip
holmes seems to be pointing at blackwood
watson looks sees nothing
watson looks and sees it and his eyes flare wide
inches from watsons right eye is the needle pointed end of a quivering piece of high tensile wire almost invisible the other end held between blackwoods hands
a really nasty concealed weapon
one more step and watson gets impaled in the eye
what a shame
that wouldve been fun
we hear heavy boots on the balcony as lestrade and his men finally appear
policemen flood the area
impeccable timing lestrade
vis blackwood is that
re girl weve gone for the doctor
re blackwood and one for the rope
you shouldve waited for my help
if i had youd be cleaning up a corpse and chasing a rumor
besides the girls parents hired me not the yard
a wry smile i cant imagine why they thought youd need any assistance
lestrade turns frustrated
he watches his men yank blackwood out of his double circle put chains on him while others carry the girl away on a stretcher
shes still mouthing the incantation
lestrade eyes the double circle the pentacle shakes his head not understanding them
grudgingly reluctantly hating himself for needing to he turns to holmes
what do you make of that
some kind of ceremony
five girls killed beneath cathedrals at the height of the full moon
indicating the double circles for his own protection
london will breathe a sigh of relief at the excellent work of scotland yard
have a cigar
holmes sticks the villains cigar in lestrades pocket and a police photographer lifts his massive camera
an explosion of light and sparks as a th century flashbulb pops
the scene is frozen bright for a split second and then it fades
dim light from a burner heats fluid in a jar a bench strewn with scientific equipment
gloved hands mix chemicals in a tray a piece of photo paper on top
another pair of hands search urgently through a row of alphabetized files coming to rest on the letter h
a bunch of h clippings hit the desk
the top one reads student and army doctor solve london mystery
a photo of holmes and watson in their s at a crime scene
their eyes are shut for the photo unaccustomed to flashes
chemicals are poured over the paper and spread across it
hands flip through more papers more headlines student brixton murders
another picture of holmes and watson
this time they look more confident the article bigger
another headline holmes and watson open for business
holmes and watson stand in front of baker street
a negative is clipped over the paper
a sudden flash of light as it is exposed
another headline doctor and detective foil jewelry scam
a picture of holmes and watson holding a goose by its feet and smiling
the men are front page news now
more headlines and photos come fast london duo do it again
a shot of holmes and watson older shaking hands with a royal
holmes and watson solve severed ear innocent
more and more headlines holmes and watson getting older solving crimes and
the files are moved to another desk where hands punch text on a vintage typewriter catacomb killer is a faint image is forming on the paper
a hand yanks the paper from the typewriter and onto a desk where a typesetter begins to assemble the story in blocks of lead type
upside down and back to front we see the words sherlock holmes one metal letter at a time
a roller dripping with ink rolls over the story we have seen assembled along with an engraving of the image
the whole thing is fed into a printing press a whirring mass of wheels and gears
papers are bundled and tied then distributed until one lands face up outside the door of baker street where we see the headline catacomb killer caught
the photo of holmes and watson sits above the fold dominating the front page
autumn has turned to winter
we follow a lady mrs
hudson walking down the street with the days shopping
she picks up a paper with the days headline blackwood hangs tomorrow claims pack with the devil
she continues down the street until arriving at baker street
a raven lands on the entry gate she shoos it away walks up the steps and inside
watson takes a blood pressure cuff off captain philips an older gentleman who sports an array of medals
the room is a tribute to military and medical order all is neat and tidy everything in its place
very good captain
me nerves are the best they been in years thanks to you
watson is pleased by that
tell me something your new offices
there wont be so many stairs i hope
no ground floor
and therell be a womans touch too
i think we can start to wean you off the medicine bang bang bang bang bang
a dozen gunshots o
captain philips hits the floor terrified
watson suppresses extreme irritation writes a prescription on a piece of paper then helps captain philips to his feet
lets give it a little longer just to be safe
beat ill be right back
he heads out letting his aggravation show once his back is turned to his patient
as watson exits his apartment and moves down the hall mrs
hudson his landlady shoots up the stairs with the paper
her nerves are almost as bad as captain philips
panting i wont go in there by myself not while hes in this state
youre not going in at all
which is a relief to mrs
what will i do when you leave
hell burn the house down around me
what will he do
couldnt you have a longer engagement
he just needs a new case thats all
captain philips emerges from watsons apartment heads towards them
i smell burning
hudsons already frayed nerves take a turn for the worse
watson takes the newspaper from her
why dont you take captain philips and give him a nice cup of tea
come on captain lets go down
itll be quieter
as they leave and perhaps some tea and bread up here when you can
watson heads down the hallway to the last door
a tendril of smoke wafts out from under it
nonetheless watson stops takes a deep breath gathers himself
something like this has happened before is in fact holmes usual brand of chaos the difference being now that watson is sick to death of dealing with it
which doesnt mean he wont
newspaper in hand watson opens the door pokes his head in cautiously
he sees watson squeezes through the doorway to find that the obstruction is holmes who is sitting in the dark on a chair blocking the door aiming a gun with
an odd contraption fastened on its barrel at the wall
a series of flaming bullet holes blasted into the wall in the ragged initials v
may i join you in the armory
watson ive been working on a device which will suppress the sound of a gunshot
watson heads towards the conservatory
dont dont dont
watson pulls open the curtains allowing the light to pour in
it needs work
may i see
watson passes him heading to the other side of the room possibly grabs the gun picking up a pile of open letters from a table
gently gently watson
watson whips open more curtains and opens a window
holmes crawls on his hands and knees over to a table where he finds his sunglasses and puts them on
watson sits on a chair and begins to leaf though the letters
its been three months since the last case
about time you found another one
i cant but agree
my mind rebels at stagnation
give me problems give me work
the sooner the better
watson hands holmes the newspaper
lets see we have a letter here from mrs
ramsey in queens park her husband has gone missing
hes in belgium with the scullery maid
is it december
lady radford reports a missing emerald bracelet
lord radford likes fast women and slow ponies
i see youre the attending physician at blackwoods hanging
yes its our last case together and i wanted to see it through to the end
lewis is seeking
hudson enters carrying a tray of bread and tea
she is steeling herself for this interaction
to watson there is only one case that intrigues me at present
the curious case of mrs
hudson the absentee landlady
i have been studying her comings and goings and they appear most sinister
hudson crosses to holmes and puts the tray before him
is it poisoned nanny
theres enough of that in you already
she goes to remove an old tray from behind him
dont touch that
everything is in its proper place as per usual
she ignores him and removes the tray then crosses back towards the door noticing a bulldog lying unconscious under the table
hes killed the dog
watson jumps up
his bulldog gladstone lies on the floor in a drugged stupor
what have you done to gladstone this time
i was simply testing a new anesthetic
he doesnt mind
as your doctor
hell be right as a trivet in no time
watsons finally had enough
and your friend youve been in this room for two weeks
i insist you get out of here
theres nothing of interest to me out there on earth at all
so you have nothing to do
then youre free this evening
youre meeting her holmes
have you proposed yet
im still looking for the right ring
a little smile from holmes
then its not official
its happening like it or not
half past eight
the dog wakes up and runs out
and wear a jacket
watson exits leaving holmes alone in his own chaos
for the first time we see a hint of fear in his eyes
holmes sits in the center of a booth waiting for watson to arrive
he is quite uncomfortable in this setting
we see his observations he picks up little pieces of information from the other guests
he notices the details on a pair of gentlemans cufflinks the name on a bottle of wine a surreptitious argument between waiters
it all becomes quite overbearing
and then watson and mary arrive talking intent on each other surprised when they realize holmes is already there
may i present miss mary morstan
holmes looks at mary morstan looks again
shes beautiful s and clearly a woman worth marrying
she extends her hand
for the life of me i dont know why its taken him so long to get us properly introduced
holmes gestures politely they sit mary and watson on either side of him
there is a decanted bottle of wine on the table
the pleasures mine
it really is a thrill to meet you mr
ive a whole stack of detective novels at home
poe wilkie collins
proudly its true
they can seem a bit far fetched sometimes though
making these grand assumptions out of tiny details
livening up oh no no
the little details are by far the most important
i intend to
watson likes that holmes less so a forced chuckle
see that walking stick
a rare african snakewood hiding a blade of high tensile steel
a few were awarded to veterans of the afghan war so i can assume hes a decorated soldier
strong brave born to be a man of action
and neat like all military men
then i check his pockets
a stub from a boxing match
now i can infer hes a bit of a gambler
a wink id keep an eye on that by the way
those days are behind me
yes right behind you
leaning in to mary hes cost us the rent more than once
with all due respect mr
holmes you know him
but what about a perfect stranger
what can you tell about me
holmes and watson exchange a glance not a good idea
i dont think thats necessary yes i doubt no itd be wonderful
at watson she insisted
instantly youre a governess
yes well done
so shall we your students a boy of
watsons getting nervous reaches for the wine
holmes stops him
back to mary then hes tall for his age
he flicked ink at you today
is there ink on my face
the waiter appears
theres nothing wrong with your face
the gentleman has already ordered for himself
to watson what would madam care for this evening
watson gives holmes a hard look thats a bit much
give us a few minutes please
he shakes his head pours wine for all
there are two drops on your ear
india blues nearly impossible to wash off anyway
a very impetuous act by the boy but youre too experienced to react rashly which is why the lady you work for lent you that necklace
its from aspreys flawless not the gems of a governess
beat however the jewels youre not wearing tell us rather more
both watson and mary scorch holmes with their eyes
pauses then you were engaged
holmes mind has gotten away from him
he begins talking faster intensely focused manic
the ring is gone
but the lighter skin where it sat suggests you spent some time abroad wearing it proudly
as holmes talks watson gets up moves to help mary to her feet
or at least until someone informed you of its true and rather modest worth at which point you broke off the engagement and returned to england for better prospects
a doctor perhaps
mary throws watsons wine in holmes face
the restaurant goes silent
she turns to leave turns back
low right on all counts but one
i didnt leave my fiance
now she leaves
well done old man
and watson goes with her
holmes lets the wine drip down over him
holmes is left at an empty table with wine running down his face
their orders arrive an array of plates piled high
the waiter puts them down holmes very carefully unfolds his napkin and places it into the top of his shirt spaghetti style takes his knife and fork and begins to
cut the meat then pauses looks around
happy couples eating laughing talking
suddenly holmes hears no words
he just sees their mouths moving
the sound of silverware clinking and scraping on fine china rises to an orchestral roar which becomes the roar of a blood thirsty mob as a fist smashes into a
face with a meaty thud
holmes staggers back from the blow
he tastes his own blood from a split lip
it interests him
he is stripped to the waist all sinew and gristle
his opponent mcmurdo huge but flabby bangs his fists together and moves in
bets rage back and forth through the pressing crowd
the room and the fight are calm the sounds muffled and indistinct a complete sensory reversal of his experience in the restaurant
this is soothing to him the ring is the only place where his mind stops racing
hes able to feel not just think
he is utterly in the moment
holmes hawk sharp gaze darts down from mcmurdos face to his muscles as they flex giving him just enough warning to move his head so that a punch grazes him
mcmurdo throws a storm of punches most of which holmes ducks or blocks
he throws nothing in return sometimes even drops his hands just using his reflexes to protect himself
once or twice he reaches out and gently touches mcmurdos face or throat when the big man leaves an obvious opening
but thats all
holmes is completely in control until he notices a face at ringside
early thirties a look of pure intrigue in her eyes and a slight smile on her lips as she watches the detective
holmes pov returns to normal when he sees her the sound floods back into the room
mcmurdo senses his opponents lapse in concentration and steps on holmes foot tramping him and he knocks holmes down with a thunderous right
holmes rolls over stands shakes his head to clear the cobwebs
he looks for the woman
he turns back to mcmurdo smiles
holmes begins walking away
we aint done here
walking away not done
and as i said thank you it was most pleasurable
face twisted in disgust mcmurdo strides forward and spits contemptuously at holmes catching him on the back of the head
the crowd falls silent
feels the back of his head smells his hand
steps back into the ring
the crowd applauds working into a fever pitch but from holmes pov all is calm
his eyes tick slowly scanning mcmurdo locking onto the big mans knee a little scar tissue nearly invisible
as mcmurdo braces for combat instantly holmes unleashes a series of superfast moves incorporating exotic martial arts
the blinding combination culminates with a spinning kick to the big mans knee which buckles altogether wrong
mcmurdo falls over and out
holmes is already turning away before the giant hits the canvas
he sees the crowd fall silent theyre not sure if they like it there really isnt any sport
he doesnt care
passing fellow fighters and flirty barmaids holmes strides out of the bar battered on the outside soothed inside
he grabs a bottle in his hand
taking a huge swig he climbs the stairs towards the upstairs rooms
a candle shivers casting jagged shadows
a row of stone cells
the sound of prisoners screaming in the dark
a full scale riot is on
five guards charge down the corridor banging on the doors to quiet the prisoners
the guard captain approaches a young guard charlie who is frozen on the spot
charlie what the hells going on down here
its jack he tried to stop blackwood from doing his spells
and now hes in some kind of fit
the guard captain continues around the corner
we see another guard jack lies convulsing on the floor
to the prisoners in the cell next to blackwood you lot shut it
to the guards charlie get down here and get him to the infirmary
the guards pick charlie up and carry him away
blackwood sits dead center in the dark
eyes closed whispering ungodly sounds
on the walls the scrawls of a madman wild symbols sketches of animals a headless sphinx an upside down cross
a hint of some method to his madness
all right blackwood whats this all about
ive a request
you dont get nothin til you stop this devil nonsense
thats a holy book blackwood closes his eyes again resumes his soft murmur
louder and you will respect it
blackwood starts whispering faster
boy you want me to muzzle you suddenly the captain starts coughing
he coughs harder
prisoners watch him stumble backwards
blackwood keeps whispering
the captain falls to one knee keeps coughing
finally the captain coughs something up spits it out onto the stone floor
he looks down horrified its a small catholic cross on a chain
prisoners start shouting
the raven at blackwoods windowsill flutters away
other guards run up terrified
get him to the infirmary now
guards pull the captain away
the remaining guard picks up the cross stares at blackwood chilled
blackwoods eyes snap open
ive a request
the fighting is over and the pub is closing
only a few people remain cleaning up mopping the beer and blood
watson enters fast looks around and moves upstairs
watson walks down a dingy hallway towards a door
with a look of resignation he opens the door to see holmes sitting alone in the sterile barely furnished room
holmes faces the corner playing scales on his violin
on the table next to him an upside down beer stein and an assortment of prescription medicine bottles
watson approaches sees holmes has bloodshot eyes from lack of sleep
watson picks one of the medicine bottles which is open
you know this is for eye surgery
i find that it lifts my spirits
its a pathological amorbic process it increases tissue change and weakness
and you know what a black reaction comes on you afterwards
watson approaches sees holmes has bloodshot eyes from lack of sleep
the beer stein is full of flies all buzzing about
look at this
if you play a chromatic scale they move clockwise
as soon as you switch to a pentatonic scale holmes plays a different scale the flies all stop moving stick to the glass
faking interest really
what about when you oops watson picks up the glass lets loose the flies
holmes looks up watsons already moving for the door pissed
lestrade wants you at pentonville prison
thats your job not mine
youre blackwoods last request
says he has information hell give only to you
but watsons already out the door
watson and holmes ride in a cab passing familiar landmarks as the city comes to life
they sit in silence tension hanging between them
finally holmes grabs watsons bag rummages around and pulls out a clean white shirt
watson looks out the window frustrated
he sees the half constructed mass of tower bridge
near ground level workers take down a large blackwood steel sign
look at that structure
what has it been
five years work already
are you aware that is the first combination of bascule and suspension bridge
as holmes is taking off his jacket he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a wad of money
oh i have your cut from last night by the way
you werent there so i laid your customary bet silence
holmes takes off his shirt
ill keep it with your check book locked safely away in my drawer
holmes pulls on the clean shirt
the opera house is featuring don giovanni and i could easily procure two tickets if you had some cultural inclination this evening
you have the grand gift of silence watson
it makes you quite invaluable as a companion
watson punches him square in the face
and your grand gift is the uncanny ability to demoralize people
i was aware shed been engaged
she told me
holmes rubs his jaw
so thats a no to the opera then
holmes puts on his vest
thats my waistcoat
its too small for you
well its my property and i want it back
holmes hands him the waistcoat which he promptly tosses out of the carriage window
holmes frowns looks out the opposite window
already a crowd is gathering outside the jail papers are for sale blackwoods death is the headline
religious zealots and occultists swarm
police keep them away from the entrance
holmes heads inside watson stops
you go ahead
ive no business with him while hes alive
a pale nervous guard leads holmes down the shadowy corridor
all the cells are now empty
where are all the other prisoners
we had to move em sir otherwise we were going to have a riot on our hands
theres something about him
its like he can get inside your head
holmes can see how spooked the guard is
im sure i can find my own way from here if you have other duties to attend to
much obliged sir
thank you thank you
the guard high tails it out of there
holmes approaches blackwoods cell strolling insouciantly
no way this creeps getting to him
in the shadows he can barely make out blackwood whos reading aloud to himself
holmes listens getting closer
quote from revelations tbd
blackwood pauses turns sees holmes
they share a smile two heavyweights sizing each other up
love what youve done with the place
thank you for joining me
a small point of concern
how can i help
id already followed the murders with some interest and while my heart went out to the families of the victims i couldnt but notice a criminal mastery in the stroke
of your brush youre too kind
however by comparison your work in the crypt was akin to a finger painting
suddenly blackwood is right at the bars close to holmes
so now youre curious as to whether theres a larger game afoot and thats why youre really here
actually my friend will pronounce you dead shortly and i thought i might keep him company
allow me to enlighten you
your mistake is to imagine that anything earthly has led to this moment
your error in judgement is to assume ive been holding the brush at all i am merely the channel
despite the bars between them the men are close together
holmes seems to be studying blackwoods ear
my only wish is that id caught you earlier
i might have spared five lives
those lives were a necessity a sacrifice
five otherwise meaningless creatures called to serve a greater purpose
i wonder if theyd let watson and i dissect your brain after youre hanged of course
id wager theres some deformity that would be scientifically significant
then you would serve a greater purpose too
holmes you must widen your gaze
im concerned you underestimate the gravity of coming events
beat for you and i are bound on a journey that will twist the very fabric of nature
beat i sense fragility beneath your mask of logic and it worries me
steel your mind holmes i need you
holmes steps back shakes his head
i must say youve come a long way down from the house of lords
but i will rise again
bon voyage blackwood
as holmes walks away blackwood calls after him
three more shall die and there is nothing you can do to save them
you must accept that this is beyond your control or by the time you realize it was you that made it all possible it will be the last sane thought
in your head
holmes walks down the corridor meets lestrade and a priest
the place is bustling with cops and officials
what did he want
holmes looks at the priest
dont think youre needed father
not for this one
the room where the execution takes place is packed to the rafters with senior officials members of the government and cops
we get a good look at some of the faces
watson is there too
blackwood walks up into the noose
his final words death is only the beginning
going over blackwoods head
slipping around blackwoods neck
clutching his bible
legs fall through and yank tight
checking blackwoods pulse
he pronounces blackwood dead
the show is over
holmes is out cold lying on his tiger skin rug
his eyes fly open
londons so bleak this time of year
reveal irene adler sits on the stairs near holmes lab cracking walnuts
she stands and holmes watches her every move as she crosses to him
she leans down putting the walnuts in front of him and flashes him a smile
not that im pining for new jersey
irene gets up to cross the room
only once her back is turned does holmes lever himself upright stunned by this intrusion
as soon as she clears he quickly moves over to a concealed safe
he tests the door to make sure its still locked
i prefer to travel in the winter
as she passes a small table that has been outfitted with tea dried fruit olives etc
i brought a few souvenirs
dates from jordan tea from ceylon and olives from cyclades
i thought wed have a little tea party to cheer us up
irene grabs a file from holmes desk
i came across this as i was setting up
irene opens the file flips through newspaper clippings and police reports her back to holmes
theft of velasquez portrait from the king of spain
missing naval documents lead to resignation of bulgarian prime minister
scandalous affair ends engagement of hapsburg prince to romanov princess
holmes stealthily turns down a photo of irene just before she turns back to face him
simply studying your methodology for when the authorities ask me to hunt you down
i dont see my name anywhere
but your signature is clear
holmes reaches for irene and pulls on a chain around her neck revealing and enormous diamond
ah the maharajahs missing diamond
he has a palace full of them
lets not dwell on the past
they move to sit at the table
by the looks of things youre between cases at the moment
and you husbands
im irene adler again and i need your help to find someone
theres nobody more brilliant or who knows london better than you
plus its a wonderful opportunity to see you again
track into irenes hypnotically beautiful eyes
holmes almost melts
then irene reaches for something inside her jacket and holmes grabs her hand
why are you so suspicious
should i answer chronologically or alphabetically
irene pulls out an envelope
this is all the information you need
she hands him the envelope
who are you working for
just for a brief moment she cant hide the anxiety in her eyes
im my own man
she stands and pulls out a large bag of coins
keep your money
i didnt say id take the case
she ignores him
holmes examines the envelope
on it is stamped the letterhead of the grand hotel
she pauses behind him as she exits
they gave me our old room
as she walks out she puts her photo back upright
irene descends the stairs just as watson is coming in
he lifts his hat waits for her to pass hello john
does a speechless double take when he sees who it is
irene keeps moving
we pick up irene crossing a street
she passes a dark alleyway
she turns into the alley
hold on the alley for a long beat
too dark to see much in there
emerges from the alley holding a lovely bunch of roses
she sniffs them appreciatively walks on
approaches a waiting carriage looks around her gets in
irene sits turns to address a man shaped shadow filling the opposite corner of the carriage
before she can speak a gesture from the shadow stills her
this is irene is made to wait as moriarty finishes writing a complex mathematical equation in astronomy folds the paper to reveal that it is addressed to the royal astronomical
society cracks open the carriage window and slides the folded paper partway out
someone waiting outside takes the paper and their footsteps clatter away
moriarty closes the window and the carriage starts moving
a full beat goes by before he turns to irene finally prepared to engage with her
i assume hell do it
not for money but for me
i wager hell find our man within twenty four hours
a better word
i sincerely hope its accurate
suddenly the coach comes to a halt they lurch forward
a rough looking beggar wearing an eye patch has fallen under a wheel of the coach
ow me leg
get out of it
you run me over sir yes you did
you fell right into the carriage
the beggar is up limping toward the window where moriarty and irene sit
he has disgusting blackened teeth
a little charity would go a long way yes it would sir
he reaches toward the window
within a nanosecond moriarty extends his hand into which a pistol appears delivered by a concealed mechanism travis bickle style
the gun rests on the beggars forehead
the cold eyes of the man that holds the weapon bore into the skull of the beggar who backs off in fear
the carriage moves on
holmes is washing his face in a basin on the other side of the room completely transformed now utterly alive
watson approaches very concerned almost enraged
look at you i cant believe you ran after her like a schoolboy again
leaping about all aflutter
are you a masochist
allow me to explain
dont you remember what she did to you
she turned you inside out she made a proper idiot of you
im sorry you were going to explain something
thank you i i know instead of just being tricked into being a witness at her wedding like last time i dont believe you dress up as clergyman and actually
perform the ceremony
shed love that
youve had your fun
this is a hopeless cause watson wont stop
whats she after anyway
now its time to press on
now its time to press on
holmes looks like hes had enough
i wont interrupt
it doesnt matter what could she possibly need
an alibi a beard a human canoe
she can sit on your back and paddle you up the thames
holmes grabs the envelope back
regrettably weve had our last case together
those are my dates
ive already read it
luke reordon four foot ten red hair missing two front teeth
holmes picks up his violin
youre just not her type holmes
she likes ginger dwarfs
so you agree
no i dont agree
its more than a technicality
youre misrepresenting the dimensions of foreshortened people
ive upset you i can tell
ive said too much
no im just saying one has disproportionate limbs the other does not
what were you just doing
will you allow me to explain
thats what ive been trying to do
holmes plucks his violin the notes play over a flashback of the previous scene all from holmes point of view
we see irene step out
why dont i see myself out
once irene leaves he steps quickly to a window and looks out to see her walking down baker street turning down an alley
he bolts into he sees watson coming up the stairs
before watson can speak holmes snatches his coat and runs down the other end of the corridor
he jumps out the window to holmes flies from the window and lands neatly on a tin roof
the jump to the next level is a more taxing prospect
holmes weighs the distance and hurls himself down with a determined look
he lands just right
holmes jumps off the shed heads for the street one block over from baker street
he runs down the mews in great haste stops at the same alley that irene disappeared into but at the other side
from concealment irene walks towards a man holding a got some roses for you sweetheart
cut you a deal cos youre so pretty
oh how nice of you
even without the man who is scrofulous and sly no woman in her right mind would go down this alley
the man with the roses beckons irene forward
another man steps in behind her trapping her
he closes in to grab her and whap
gets three cosh strikes across the chin dropping him immediately
still holding the roses the man finds himself smacked up against the bricks with irenes hand over his mouth
quick as a snake she slices upwards with a razor sharp knife cutting his belt then his clothes all the way to his collar
the move ends with irenes finger over her own mouth signalling the mugger to be quiet
he obeys eyes bulging
irene frisks him expertly
shes mugging the mugger
there is excitement in her eyes this turns her on
oh look a wallet
doesnt look like yours does it
and naughty boy heres another one
ill return them shall i
she takes both wallets takes the roses these are lovely thank you
and leaves stepping daintily over the crumpled man on the floor
on second thoughts she turns back takes his wallet too then leaves
now thats the irene i know
he hurries after irene down the alley
holmes exits the alley catches a glimpse of irene through a street fair which is being assembled
holmes picks up the pace
he snatches a hat from a one eyed old beggar with his hand out
he drops a coin in his hand then another coin and snatches the beggars eye patch too
he runs past a coal cart snags a lump of coal rubs it on his face and hands then pops it in his mouth chews it to blacken his teeth
he pauses to singe the sleeve of watsons coat on a fairground fire breathers flames runs on
holmes emerges as the beggar we saw previously
again he stops the coach and again the gun comes out but this time we can see that holmes gets a view of the man on the other end of
the weapon before the carriage pulls away
holmes strums one more chord on his violin thinking
irenes bag of money still sits on the table
this man intrigues me watson
hes got adler on edge
which is no mean feat
shes intimidated scared
and yet she works for him
thats bad money
its nothing to do with me but leave this case
holmes motions to the bills
well i may not have a choice
a man has to make a living
after all ill be paying the rent entirely on my own
you know what ive had just about enough clarky
mister holmes sir
he turns to see
constable clark standing at the door
breathless pale scared
inspector lestrade asks that you come with me at once
mumbles whats he done now lost his way to scotland yard
watson grab a compass
you means us
us means you
its lord blackwood sir
it appears hes come back from the dead
well thats clever seeing as how i pronounced him dead myself
a groundsman saw him walking through the graves just this morning
ill leave this one in your capable hands
i have tea with mary and her parents this evening
watson walks into his office
it is not my reputation at stake here
are you taking this seriously
like it or not its a matter of professional integrity
no girl wants to marry a doctor who cant tell if a mans dead or not
they all move to the exit
watson youd do well to hide your medical certificates in case theyre revoked
judging by the estate blackwood comes from old money and lots of it
we follow the carriage hurrying holmes and watson forward
generations of wealth buried in moss covered marble memorials
not a place for a picnic not even on a bright sunny day and its starting to rain
a cop stops the carriage opens the door
holmes and watson exit watson carries a black leather forensics they walk up the pathway towards the blackwood family crypt
watson barely lifts his head scanning the ground while holmes appears to have taken an interest in a clump of trees in the distance
look at this mess
nothing but standard issue police bootprints
any possible evidence there might have been has been trampled
scotland yard at their finest once again
police lamps light one large marble crypt
the cops are in tight clusters whispering to themselves spooked
theyd rather be anywhere but here
as holmes and watson approach they see the marble doors of the crypt have been blasted open from the inside
holmes and watson share a quick glance this is interesting
lestrade emerges from the crypt
he is sweating shaken
holmes offers lestrade his handkerchief lestrade waves it off
look at those slabs of marble theyre half a ton each if theyre a pound smashed outward like they were nothing
on second thought lestrade does take holmes handkerchief
explain it if you can holmes
holmes inspects the door checking the hinges
he notices the blackwood crest and the image of a sphinx
and the coffin
were digging it up now
the witness is over there
you can question him if you like but you wont get much
the old groundskeeper pale and terrified stands out of the rain under an ancient cypress tree
watson heads for him
holmes disappears in the opposite direction
as soon as their backs are turned lestrade marches over to a nervous knot of cops grabs a fistful of blue in each hand drags his boys in close
he doesnt want holmes or watson to hear this
low angry if you lot dont stop behaving like a bunch of superstitious milk maids youre on double time
youre an embarrassment
also youre forbidden to talk about this to anyone not a word
are we bloody clear on that
the cops nod duly chastened
mumbles the lords prayer under his breath
watson immediately goes into doctor mode checking his pulse looking in his eyes
the groundskeeper just keeps praying
watson takes a boiled sweet from his pocket pops it in the mans mouth and gently sits him down
holmes walks over holding a small branch from a tree
hes in shock
we should give him a few moments
lestrade stomps up
the witness stated that he saw lord blackwood rise from the grave
at watson accusingly well
you pronounced the man dead
stung he had no pulse
inspector do you know if this is a spruce or a sycamore
lestrade shakes his head
it hasnt been a good day for him or the yard
theres a clunk
they all turn to see the coffin has been extracted from the crypt
four beefy soil stained cops emerge lugging the coffin
they place it on the ground step back crossing themselves murmuring plainly terrified
but no one moves
the cops pass a crowbar around as if it were red hot
watsons had enough
he marches forward snatches the crowbar away jams it under the lid and levers it off with a slow eerie groan
holmes and lestrade move forward the cops move backward
the coffin is filled with earth overflowing
they brush away a layer of dirt to reveal
a dead body in the coffin
the body is a much smaller man than blackwood in everyday clothes with red hair
thats not blackwood
now that we have a firm grasp of the obvious
watson opens his forensic kit disturbed
vials silver tools
he takes a caliper begins examining the body
lividity is late stage
diptera deposits are approximately measuring three quarters of an inch putting the time of death at ten to twelve hours ago
inspector may i see your pen
lestrade hands over a nice fountain pen still stunned
holmes takes the pen and pries open the corpses mouth revealing two missing teeth in the mans jaw
missing two incisors in the upper jaw
a look at holmes adlers midget
holmes spots something glinting in the mans dirt filled pocket
he uses the pen to fish out a pocket watch
all yours inspector
holmes hands the pen back to lestrade
lestrade looks at it with dismay takes it in holmes handkerchief a small measure of revenge
holmes and watson begin walking away from the crypt
lestrade follows anxious
holmes shows him the dusty pocket watch
scratches around the keyhole where the watch is wound
most drunks are the same and pawnbrokers scratch the ticket number and their initials inside the lid
this one has five so the owner he was walking
they all stop suddenly
the old groundskeeper stands in front of them ready to unburden himself
quivering voice he was walking but his feet didnt touch the ground
and im not daft i know what i saw and i know lord blackwood
he was as alive as you or me
its not right
its not natural
turns leaves our father who art in heaven
all three men watch the groundskeeper go
a sudden gust of wind moans eerily
they all want to get the hell out of there
now the game is afoot watson
holmes stands in the middle of the street contentedly observing humanity
watson enters frame and hands holmes a bundle wrapped in newspaper
i fail to see how these fish and chips are different from the three other places we passed along the way
holmes complies hungrily and they start to stroll along
watson appears preoccupied
you know ive seen things in war that i couldnt explain
i once heard a man predict his death down to the number and placement of the bullet holes that killed him
you have to admit that a supernatural explanation is at least theoretically possible
mouth full near indecipherable never theorize before you have data
invariably you end up twisting facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts
adlers midget is the key to this
holmes pulls out a jewelers loup screws it into his eye and flips reordons watch open
he examines the lid
scratches around the keyhole what does that tell you
the owner was most likely a drunk
each time he wound the watch his hand would slip hence the scratches
very good watson
youve developed considerable powers of your own
watson looks quite chuffed
lets see now there are several sets of initials scored into the lid
watson looks extremely pleased with himself until they turn a corner into a street where every second shop is a pawn shop
his face falls
the most recent is m
watson shakes his head
maddison and haig
oh my lord here we are
they should give us an address
discreet ahead of them there on bow street
theres one thing youve missed
on the watch
i think not
which leads me to deduce that im already late for my appointment with mary
you remember the one i was leaving for before you talked me into coming to dig up dead bodies with you
a gypsy palm reader approaches watson as he turns to leave
reckon your future sir
perhaps we do need a little help from the beyond
no thank you
she grabs his hand anyway
you need to hear what i have to tell you
watson is so taken aback by the urgency and gravity of her tone that he doesnt pull away
i see two men brothers
not in blood but in bond
i see the letters s and an l no
wait a holmes and watson look at each other
she has their attention
wincing i see madness
a man driven out of his mind by a malign force
watson looks at holmes
i see a letter
the letter m
you will be married
horrified patterned table clothes china figurines lace doilies
watson snatches his hand away
you think you are clever dont you
holmes feigns innocence
she turns to fat
the palm reader looks at holmes
to watson do you have any changes
watson shakes his head as he pays the woman
this is a new low even for you
its the most honest prediction old flora has made in years
and you know it yourself watson
that is precisely the reason you cant find a suitable ring
youre terrified of a life without the thrill of the macabre as well you should be
holmes swallows the last of his cod and casts the wrapping aside pleased with himself
do you still have my cut from the fight
holmes digs into a pocket produces a wad of coins
why do you watson snatches the money storms into madison and haig
holmes is confused until he spots a sign in the window large selection of engagement rings for every wallet
holmes starts to look a bit nervous
as he follows watson he is intercepted by the palm reader who grabs his arm
i seen something in his hand
darkness and great pain
warn your friend hes not safe
even holmes is taken aback by this
holmes and watson move down the street the pawnshop behind them
now watson is smiling and holmes is not
watson is beaming at an engagement ring in a box
not bad eh
holmes turns away looks down at the ticket he got from the pawnshop an address
reordons lodgings should be right around this bend
here we are
he slows looks up at a dark dingy lodging house
some windows are boarded up
and possibly dangerous
oh well give my regards to mary
holmes heads for lodging house
watson checks his watch
holmes winds his way up a twisting flight of creaky stairs finds a door with scratches on the keyhole
holmes takes out his knife and goes to work on the lock
it is fiddly
it takes him a while
he kneels to get a better angle with the knife
watsons boot flashes past him as he kicks the door off its hinges
off holmes pleased reaction he gestures them inside
i can spare ten minutes
the squalid doorway opens into a series of dark rooms
watson lights a lamp which reveals details of an interior that stops them both in their tracks from floor to ceiling every available inch is covered in writing biblical latin
scrawled on paper and pages are tacked to walls and carved into the plaster crucifixes punctuate the yards of text and collage strange pagan charms hang from the ceiling
he clearly felt something was coming to get him
they move further inside where there is a hallway and a basic bedroom
holmes inspects it moves through a door
watson come take a look at this watson puts down what he was looking at goes towards
instantly watson covers his nose with a handkerchief
reeling bloody hell
the room is stacked with an alarming amount of scientific and biological paraphernalia
some of it gives off a distinctly electrical hum
ungodly fragments of limbs and matter float in jars
inhaling deeply loving it ammonium sulfate
in the center of the room something rotting
an experiment generating a massive stench a seething cloud of flies
holmes and watson step closer to see dead frogs
eyes opened impossibly wide their bodies frozen in strange contortions as if mid death rattle
holmes moves around the room sniffing like a morbid perfumer
watson does his best not to gag
appears he was attempting to follow occult formula with scientific practice
watson moves to the stove sees a sheaf of burnt papers
he digs through them finds one piece not as burnt as the rest
a crest stamped on it impossible to read
watson digs through his forensic bag pulls out vials
has he any hydrochloric acid
holmes shuffles a few bottles tosses one to watson
watson catches it starts pouring the acid another chemical on a clean sheet of paper
holmes senses something moves into the next room
he stops at an open window smells the curtains irene was here
watson presses the chemical soaked paper onto the burnt paper
why would she hire you to find him if she planned to do the job herself
maybe its not the man shes after but something else
something he was working on
sucks the iron right out of the ink
long as its not too burnt
watson keeps rubbing the paper together puts it by the lantern
slowly faint words appear on the blank page
watson sees the crest is blackwoods
he worked for blackwood
holmes gets a whiff of something raises an eyebrow
he starts walking back to the other room
theres one odor i cant put my finger on
sweet almost like perfume
stops sniffs barley sugar
the door whips open
two thugs spill into the room
they are followed by dredger a huge man just shy of seven feet tall and pushing pounds slightly deformed who follows them into the room
he sucks on a twisty stick of barley sugar victorian hard candy
they stop surprised to see holmes and watson
holmes eyes widen at the giant
dredger is deadpan
let me guess youre here to extinguish any connection between the man who lived here and the man you work for
curious youd still be running errands for a dead man
smiles you do like to talk
the two thugs step toward holmes and watson
you take them ill handle mr
seems about fair
watson meets the men in the middle of the room swinging at them
as they dodge and swing back holmes grabs a standing lamp sliding it into his hand as a weapon
he looks at dredger knows it wont make a dent
he keeps moving swinging the lamp toward a curtain
in the blink of an eye he wraps up the curtain ripping it down bringing the heavy steel rod with it
he catches the rod flipping it so the curtain rings rain to the floor
he spins the rod expertly smashing it into dredgers face
it stuns the giant for a beat but quickly dredger lunges forward trapping the steel rod under his arm
he grabs the rod and hurls holmes through the air sending him flying into
holmes crash lands on the table scattering all the bottles and tools
he blinks trying to gather his senses
he sees dredger incoming as watson tussles with the thugs a bar room brawler
head butting one kicking the other in the groin
the men whip out knives
watson ducks and dodges blades flashing on either side of him
one of the blades slices his shirt ripping off his pocket so the engagement ring falls to the floor
one of the thugs accidentally kicks it sending it across the ground
as watson follows the ring with his eyes the first man hurls his knife
watson just barely ducks the blade which smacks into the second thug who falls
watson fights the first thug as he scrambles toward the ring
dredger bears down on holmes
holmes reaches out for some kind of weapon anything he can grab
he snatches a short shaft
a truly pathetic weapon
dredger lurches toward holmes who swings the metal shaft desperately and
the shaft sparks
a flash of light and crackle and dredger gets an electric shock that sends him flying back twenty feet watson finishes off his thug and plucks the engagement ring off
the floor just as dredger flies through the air slamming into watson knocking him off his feet and knocking the ring away
holmes looks at the lightning rod in his hand stunned by the efficacy of the weapon
dredger tries to recover climbing off of watson
holmes cranks his weapon
the rod sparks and hums
dredger pulls himself up with the help of a water pipe on the wall
holmes thinks quickly then touches the other end of the pipe with the rod and zzzapppp
the electrical current runs along the pipe and knocks dredger back twenty more feet
watson spots the ring rolling towards the window starts running for it frantic as dredger rises a clear change in his demeanor
he looks at the sparking rod and races for the window as well
watson chases the engagement ring bends down
just as hes about to grab it
dredgers massive foot stomps down on the ring
dredger gives watson a cruel smile then leaps out the window landing atop a heap of coal
watson glares as holmes blasts past him leaps out the window
watson picks up the ring sees the stone was knocked out of the setting lost in the floorboards the rest of the ring mangled
watson darkens grips his ruined ring and heads out dredger runs down the street knocking people out of his way
holmes gives chase darting around people trailing dredger through the gates of a huge commercial shipbuilders
watson brings up the rear as dredger runs towards a slipway which holds the unfinished hull of a large ship
the vessel cant be far from completion it sits in a wheeled carriage designed to see it smoothly into water
for now though big wooden chocks hold it in place the whole thing is attached to a heavy chain that coils back around the shed that they just ran through
holmes trails the hulking form of dredger into this network of struts
they weave through the shadows
holmes sees one of the cables shifting slightly
he takes an angle to cut off dredger and
holmes steps into dredgers path hitting him with the lightning rod knocking him back
holmes gives another jolt but the shaft starts to lose power
dredger knows there isnt much juice left
he reaches out grabs the weapon and
smiles a terrifying smile
a moment of reckoning between holmes and dredger the shaft slowly
dredger tosses the rod
and now holmes backs away as dredger grabs a sledgehammer and swings the hammer at holmes smashing some of the wooden supports tearing others out of his way
the ship lurches forward
watson runs round the end of the building and sees holmes scrambling under the half built hull
dredger in pursuit
a police whistle echoes through the air
dredger turns for a moment just long enough for holmes to launch himself at dredger
they tumble down onto the massive runners on the floor of the slipway
holmes wrestles dredgers head onto the runner and pins him down
dredger kicks out viciously splintering another chock
its the last straw for the support mechanism the whole thing starts to creak
from his vantage point watson can see whats coming
grappling frantically on the runners both holmes and dredger look up as the huge chocks holding the ship the propellers on the stern of the ship start sliding down towards
dredger looks up at the approach of the propellers holmes charges into dredger again pulling him backwards across the runners
dredger pulls holmes down with him holmes head hits the ground hard
holmes lies semi conscious eyes rolled back into his head as the leviathan roars down towards him
the ground beneath him shakes knocks his head against the runner once twice as he blinks back into consciousness he sees the great shadow sweeping over him
the stern lurches to a stop inches from his face
he opens one tentative eye half expecting to find himself in the after life and sees black metal an inch from his nose
he realizes the ship has stopped but he doesnt know why
he tries to roll out of the way as we see the chain extended taut as a tight rope behind the half launched ship
the ship squeals and groans as its timber supports buckle and crack with the weight of the tethered ship
a beat where the whole business hangs in limbo and
the timber finally gives way
the ship is free again falling through the air holmes rolls sideways as the propellers slice through the air above his head the hull screams past him with a sound
like the side of the world being torn off and then the ships away parting the thames with a vast frothy explosion of water
holmes watches the ship drift gracefully out into the river from vortex to serenity in a matter of seconds
a quiet beat
holmes collapses back great gulps of air disappearing into his lungs
he tries to pull himself to his feet but dredgers bone shaking punches have taken it out of him and he sags back to the ground
watson arrives helps him to his feet
they stagger back to the slipway where dredger was standing
and they find
no blood or trace
the big man is gone
the police whistles get louder officers swarm the scene
they see the wreckage the ship adrift and
holmes and watson
watson looks at his watch and does a slow deep burn
the next morning
a giant holding cell where every shade and aspect of victorian villainy is corralled
holmes wakes up on a bench after a peaceful nights sleep
watson sits next to him exhausted bloodshot eyes
hes reading his notebook making the odd change here and there
holmes looks up and sees watson staring at him shaking his head
i havent slept all night
i deserve this
i clearly deserve it
how could i ever be so deluded as to believe i could meet marys parents for tea once i let myself be talked into going with you
now of course im in jail
holmes tries to wiggle his fingers which causes him enough pain that he decides to bind them with irenes handkerchief
theatrically indignant youre not implying that i am responsible for our current situation are you watson
we were set upon man it was self defense
watson shakes the notebook in holmes face
ive used the time to review my notes on our exploits of the last seven months
and ive come to the conclusion that i must be suffering from to some profound psychological aberration
why else would i continually allow myself to be led into situations where youre deliberately withholding your intentions from me
youve never complained about my methods before
im not complaining
i never complain
i never complain about your violin playing at three in the morning your mess your lack of hygiene your stealing my clothes your setting our home on fire
that was an accident
watson challenges him with a look
the first time was an accident
remember me boys
put me away for robbery a few years back
holmes turns and comes face to face with a dangerous looking man who has a few conspicuous warts on his face
the fifteenth most dangerous man in london
watson snaps at the man
who could forget that face
i told you a little nitrate of silver and the warts will be gone in two weeks
now if youll excuse us
brownlee takes a swing at watson
holmes checks him and drops brownlee without missing a beat
to holmes nor am i complaining about the fact that you terrorize my patients and perform outlandish experiments on my dog
gladstones my dog as well
its in the interest of science
what i do take issue with is your ruthless campaign to sabotage my relationship with mary
watson i completely understand now
youre overtired and feeling a bit sensitive
watson now turns away completely irritated at holmes lack of understanding
what you need is a rest
you and i could go out to the countryside
my brother mycroft has a small estate near chichester
it has marvelous grounds and a beautiful folly
we could throw a lamb on the spit
watson shakes his head in disbelief
if i were going to the country i would be going with my future wife certainly
we should have her along
lets get gladstone out of the house as well
me and her
youre not invited
now youre not making any sense watson
why would i not be invited to my own brothers country home
youre not human
you dont get it do you
you are this
touches his own head without this
he touches his own heart
they hear a billyclub hit the bars
you made bail
watson steps up
holmes looks confused
he steps forward
but the guard shakes his head
as he slides open the bars they see
mary emerges from behind the guard
watson stands for a beat between holmes and mary
he must make a decision
and he does he leaves
holmes watches him walk out then locks eyes with mary
she gives him a polite nod turns heads off with watson
the bars slide shut
the mob surrounds holmes
hes never looked more alone
lestrade heads toward the holding room flanked by prison wardens
as the door is opened the thug blasts out backwards having just been battered through it by holmes
lestrade your usual impeccable timing
you know in another life youd have made an excellent criminal
and you sir an excellent policeman
holmes and lestrade march along
lestrade holds out a copy of the newspaper
the headline reads blackwood tell me you have answers
all in good time
we dont have time
ive an office full of policemen hanging crosses over their desks
a public thats working itself into a frenzy
holmes sees a dark strange carriage waiting door open
try to behave yourself
they just paid a small fortune to bail you out
an anonymous man sits in the other seat
im afraid youll have to put this on
he holds a black hood
the hood is pulled off
holmes takes in the scene eyes flicking around the room
hes in a grand office where a man in his late s sir thomas rises from a pile of papers
holmes apologies for summoning you like this
im sure its quite a mystery as to where you are and who i am
as to where i am i was admittedly lost for a moment between charing cross and holborn
but i was saved by the bread shop on saffron hill the only bakers to use a certain french glaze on their loaves
after that the carriage forked left then right a bump over the fleet conduit need i go on
somewhat stunned sir thomas shakes his head
as to who you are that took every ounce of my not inconsiderable experience and skill
the letters on your desk are addressed to sir thomas rotheram lord chief justice
that would be your official title
who you realy are is another matter entirely
sir thomas is not in the mood for this but holmes is on a roll
judging by the sacred ox on your ring youre also the secret head of the temple of the four orders in whose headquarters we now stand on the northwest corner
beat and as to the mystery the mystery is why you bothered to blindfold me in the first place
yes well its standard procedure i suppose
holmes shakes his head what a massive lack of judgement on their part
i think we have the right man
holmes turns to see john standish and lord coward standing behind him
standish is an american in his sixties
coward is a hard ambitious man in his s
sherlock holmes ambassador standish from america and lord coward the home secretary
holmes acknowledges them barely as they enter
he isnt impressed by rank
i suppose you already have some notion as to the practices of our order
theyre almost interesting
be as skeptical as you like but our secret systems have steered the world towards the greater good for centuries
the danger is that they can also be exploited for more nefarious purposes
what some call the dark arts or practical magic
holmes looks around the room sees flags on the walls with ancient symbols variations of the sphinx
we know youre are a rationalist
we dont ask you to share our faith only our fears
fear is the more infectious condition
at sir thomas in this case fear of your own child
that shocks them rigid
blackwood is your son yes
you have the same colored irises a rare dark green with diamond shaped hazel flecks
pointing at sir thomas ear plus identical outer ears or pinna which only pass down through the direct bloodline which would make you either brothers or more likely father and
stunned the men consult silently come to some sort of conclusion
they turn back to holmes
sir thomas seems especially shaken
very few people are privy to that information and we want to keep it that way
sir thomas opens a bureau digs for something
he was conceived during one of our rituals
his mother wasnt my wife but she shared our beliefs
she was a powerful practitioner
though not enough to survive giving birth to him
holmes is appalled and shows it
we were young
it was before we fully understood the powers we were dealing with
death followed him wherever he went from his birth to arms he made and sold
what family he had tended to
no one could prove anything of course but we all knew sir thomas hands holmes a tintype
a photograph from the s
its chilling a death scene a body covered by a sheet
a man whos just fallen out a window
a ten year old boy young lord blackwood looks on
the boy was a curse
i didnt have the courage either to take him in or to
all this is history
the present and future are worse
weve done our best to stop him ourselves but its not enough
his power grows daily and exponentially
his resurrection is evidence of that
what he does next will be far more dangerous hes going to raise a force that will alter the very course of our world
we need you to find him and stop him before he does
well give you any assistance we can
as home secretary i have considerable influence over the police
beat name your price
holmes looks at coward with scathing disdain
one of the great benefits of my work is that i can pick and choose my clients
ill get him but not for you
holmes stalks out stops at the door turns fixes sir thomas with a very bleak gaze
i have one last question sir thomas
what is it
holmes holds up the tintype
if the rest of his familys dead why are you still alive
holmes tosses the tintype onto a table leaves
holmes comes out of a carriage and scoots up the steps of the massive hotel thats bustling with people
irene enters wearing a stunning evening dress
she pauses glancing briefly around the room before sitting at a mirrored dressing table
theres a decanter on the table next to her from which she pours herself a glass of wine
then she begins removing an impressive assortment of weapons hidden on her person she pulls a stiletto from her garter a derringer from her waistband which she puts down next
to the wine glass
she pulls long thin needles from her hair lets her hair down
as she continues
pull back to reveal holmes watching her from a shadowy corner
he looks on silently until if youre going to watch me take my clothes off sherlock the least you can do is help me with the buttons
to watch a lady undress without her permission is a criminal offense sherlock and could get you into a lot of trouble
they both eye the derringer on the table
so why dont you come over here and help me instead
holmes approaches her somewhat tentatively and reaches for the top button on the back of her dress
you can stop looking for reardon
i knew i could count on you
he was buried in blackwoods tomb
irene is momentarily taken aback then recovers
case closed then
your services are no longer required
unbuttoning done holmes steps out to confront irene
i cant help wondering if your employer will be as content with these results
you were uncharacteristically ill at ease in his presence
your hand was trembling your gaze was averted
i couldnt see his face but i spotted chalk on his lapel
a professor perhaps
irene gets up walks behind a dressing screen
behind screen the eye patch was a nice touch
but ive never known a professor to carry a gun and on such a clever contraption
lets not argue
irene steps out now wearing an array of victorian undergarments
the huge diamond still around her neck
she moves back to the dressing table
holmes wont look at her refusing to get turned on
tell me who youre working for and what hes after
thats nobodys business but my own
you see we are arguing
holmes gets closer and closer to irene as he presses his case vehemently
when a man you ask me to find ends up dead in the coffin of the most notorious murderer since jack the ripper and that murderer manages to return from
the dead not only is it my business its the business of scotland yard and the highest levels of the british government
they will certainly consider your reticence to be an obstruction of justice
which in relation to a crime of this magnitude would certainly mean prison time
this wine is excellent
you should really try some
holmes notices her derringer on the table next to the wine bottle
so whats it to be
do we really have to decide now
irene reaches for the wine
youre in over your head this time irene
irene snatches up her gun
holmes grabs her arm
a bullet tears into his shoe missing his toe
holmes snatches away the smoking derringer
irene kisses him hard and angry at first becoming something else
another of the weapons in her arsenal and the one that disarms holmes
the kiss leads them to the bed
irene pulls him down to it
he doesnt resist
holmes eyes flare with surprise
irene has handcuffed him to the bed frame
this is the only way it could ever work between us sherlock one in shackles the other with the key
she gets off him
while he struggles on the bed irene walks casually across the room
she starts putting on mans clothing
shes in charge now
ive never been in over my head
how can you live like this always a fugitive
she approaches now dressed as a man straddles him
and on my own terms
just like you well not you at this exact moment
she pulls at the front of his trousers throws the handcuff keys down there
but generally speaking
holmes has no retort
irene takes the scarf off his neck moves to the doorway
if anyone asks please let them know that mr
oneil didnt have time to check out
beat i hope you dont mind settling the bill
what were you doing consorting with a married business traveller in his hotel room is something youll have to explain for yourself
she picks up two suitcases waiting for her at the door new prop
and as she leaves wheres watson when you need him
sir thomas enters the hall from outside he looks tired
his butler perigrine stands there waiting for him
good evening sir
some figs and honey with a nice glass of port
ive prepared a tray
no thank you perigrine im going to bed
as he heads upstairs you wont let those figs go to waste will you
nor the port sir
thomas smiles goes up
perigrine heads for the kitchen licking his lips
sir thomas sinks into his bath
the camera slowly tracks in drip drip drip
the silence is broken all of a sudden when the tap is magically turned on
sir thomas opens his eyes in panic as he hears an eerie whisper o
like the rushing of wind
sir thomas is overcome with panic tries to sit up
not all the way
thomas blinks and sees that blackwood now sits in the corner of the bathroom lit in a sinister fashion
sir thomas eyes widen the muscles stand out in his neck as he fights paralysis
he slides back down slowly
you cant fight it
it comes from a power greater than yours
you can only surrender
the water flows over sir thomas as blackwood steps closer and takes the sacred ring from his rigid finger
ive been imagining this moment for a long time
the water closes over his face
sir thomas stares up at blackwood who watches him drown slowly and surely
i must admit its better than i thought it would be
carrying an armful of laundry a maid slips a pass key into a lock and opens the door
to be confronted by the snoring form of holmes still handcuffed to the bed
clothes in total disarray
her shriek wakes him
he looks down at himself and reacts with shock then grim recognition sets in
dont take this the wrong way but might i borrow your hand
holmes sits beside a cop and opposite constable clark
chambermaids were once such a liberal breed
besides she misinterpreted my intention entirely
this is why i find this modern religious fervor so troubling there is no latitude for misunderstanding
he looks out the carriage window and sees signs of a spiritualist gathering
faith runs riot over reason
well its a good thing she was offended or wed never have found you
the inspectors been over to baker street himself this morning
the coach stops
holmes steps out of the coach and is escorted inside by constable clark
holmes is briefed by constable clark as they enter
as constable clark continues in holmes swivels away weve checked everything
no sign of a break in
the butler didnt hear anything
the body was in the tub eyes wide open so that const
clark ends up talking to thin air
realizing holmes isnt there only his ring was missing
he turns puzzled looking for holmes finds him right back at the doorway in full virtuoso detective mode
right now right here is where holmes is at his very best this is in fact why he exists
holmes is satisfied by what he sees or finds continues into the bathroom where a police officer stands over the tub and sir thomas body covered with a blanket
the tub has been drained
the kind of crime scene violation that holmes cannot get them to stop doing
why did you drain the water
out of common decency
incensed crime is common logic is rare
the decent thing to do is catch the killer not provide comfort to the corpse
neither the officer nor clark have a response
holmes swivels sees a jar of bath salts on the table next to the chair blackwood sat in leans over scoops it up opens it sniffs it
holmes thrusts the open jar under the officers nose
what is that
i suspect this comes from a larger cannister
itll either be in the pantry high up where its warm and dry or in a linen closet with a vent
and constable you could check the ground under the rear windows for any footprints not your own
both cops hesitate holmes is not their boss
data data data
i cannot make bricks without clay
the cops hurry away
now holmes can really get down to work
this may mean he gets on his belly for a floors eye view it may mean he looks down from a window sill
sometimes he hums or sings to himself
holmes is happy
he glances around the room sees the chair where blackwood was perched sits in it himself
his eyes keep moving noticing something on a wall
he steps toward it runs his hand along a layer of dust
the dust has a line down it as if the wall cracked open
holmes steps to the sink grabs a handful of talcum powder and tosses the powder against the wall revealing
fingerprints on one of the panels
he pushes the panel and the wall shifts opening to reveal a secret room
holmes enters holmes finds a desk with a prayer table and ancient texts spellbooks one book open to a picture of alexander the great at the sphinx
he steps toward an altar below the image of the sphinx
on the altar four strange objects a strand of human hair a cows bone a large sharp fang and a feather
holmes pockets the altar items and a couple pieces of paper just as const
clark and the officer return the officer proudly hugging a lb
cannister of jasmine bath salts
they are startled by the secret room they are even more startled by the sight of holmes kneeling at the altar and singing to himself
as soon as they arrive holmes springs to his feet and walks out
maybe he continues singing between words
vis the secret room i have no idea what to make of that
vis the bath salts excellent work
holmes walks up the stairs and finds watsons office door open
he is well into packing his things
the office is full of boxes the walls and shelves are very sparse
dont forget the wallpaper
there isnt any
figure of speech
holmes steps into the room
since this room is no longer in use do you mind if i employ it
be my guest
bring him in boys
holmes steps aside
two three policemen enter carrying a large heavy bag and unceremoniously dump it on watsons desktop
they unzip the bag revealing the dead body of the thug from reordons lodging
who was he
my new roommate
hes an inspiring conversationalist
alt he has more humor than you
no hes your friend from reordons
he didnt survive dredger landing on him
but there is some consolation in the knowledge that he can still be of service to his fellow men
watson keeps packing
holmes analyzes the body starting of all places with the outer elbows and forearms of his coat
holmes grabs various instruments and other items from watsons newly packed boxes
frustrated watson snatches them back as quickly as holmes takes them out
elbows and arms stained with blood but older than his own injuries
plenty of it layer on layer
holmes scrapes at the layers of blood with his knife examines it
though none of it human
watson slows down slightly
he keeps packing trying to resist the mystery but its not easy
a butcher perhaps
holmes cuts a lock of the mans hair ignites it studies the color of the flame carefully
watson wrinkles his nose at the smell
hm predominantly yellow flame but with distinct green bursts
he spent lots of time around industrial work and very little around a wash basin
holmes uses a curved nail file to scrape dirt from under the mans fingernails rubs the evidence between his fingers like a connoisseur
watson slows down further struggling
that plus the river silt and industrial slag on his trousers puts him squarely in
a hanging beat
and watson finally cracks blurting out nine elms
now you didnt happen to pack the lords register of members interests did you
watson pulls it out of a box
see what blackwood admits to owning
as watson flips through it holmes plucks a few chords on his violin thinking
watson finds the page
its endless hes had a hand in just about everything thats not good for you
something brutal by the river
queenshithe slaughterhouse nine elms
thats it watson
this should lead us right to blackwood
holmes leaps up and readies himself to leave
not us you
this gives holmes pause
best of luck with everything then
same to you
a brief nod then holmes is gone
a beat as watson continues packing
he heaves a box up moves for his suitcase
after a moment he notices
he picks it up
as he contemplates the weapon he becomes more serious
he mouths a curse to himself and sees their dog giving him a disapproving look
yes i know
dont give me that look gladstone
he pockets the gun grabs his jacket and heads out
a figure moves across the dark gothic courtyard
it is ambassador standish
as he cuts through the shadows
a few drops of rain trickle down
he looks up surprised by the rain
he raises his collar and keeps moving
he hits the door to a building
it is locked
he bangs on the door as the rain comes harder
the door finally opens
as he enters we see the rain stops behind him gone as fast as it came
a raven flaps into the night
standish comes up the stairs wiping the raindrops off his coat trying to dry himself as he enters a five sided room
a few dozen venerable looking characters arrange themselves in seats
lord coward stands next to a central throne
he stays standing as they all sit all except standish
whats the meaning of this
why did you call us here
sir thomas is dead
effective immediately i nominate lord blackwood as head of the order
are you mad coward
have you any idea what hes capable of
of course he does
its why hes here
he looks as if hes been to hell and come back more powerful than ever
the crowd is stunned
standish looks at coward betrayed turns to the others who are transfixed by the sight of blackwood suddenly kneeling before them
i am humbled
i am honored
beat my powers and my assets munitions shipping industry they were given to me for a purpose
a magnificent and simple purpose
a different future
a future ruled by us
blackwood stands prowls
youve made policy in secret for centuries
now youll make it openly
the men are beginning to like what they hear
the first act is a necessary one for without death there can be no rebirth
beat at noon tomorrow we will take the first step towards a new chapter in history
beat england will know our power
then the whole world will
across the atlantic lies a colony that was once ours and will be again
their civil war weakened them their government is as corrupt and ineffective as ours
well take it from them
beat with their resources and our power well remake the world well create the future
beat are you with me
no sir we are not
turning to the others the powers hes playing with are beyond any mans control
theyre limitless even death holds no sway
help me stop him before its too late
blackwood smiles hes won
in desperation standish pulls a gun
but as he aims it at blackwood i wouldnt do that
he ignites combusting with an impossible blast of the men in the room reel backwards shocked terrified
flames consuming him standish flails crashing through a window out to the fireball plummets through the sky lighting city blocks
people look up gape and whoompf
standish lands on the roof of a carriage
horses and carriages screech to a stop
the flames flicker blinding white as his body contorts melting away
people scream gasp faint cross themselves as they witness this unnatural act
blackwood turns away from the window surveys them
they are terrified but they are with him
blackwood turns to coward nods
coward produces a brimming silver chalice
come drink your allegiance here
the members line up to drink from a chalice
it doesnt taste good but it tastes like power
as they drink blackwood leans close to coward
you control the police
an industrial area on a bend of the thames
work doesnt stop when the sun goes down
wharves stretch out into the water
we see a boat is being loaded
we pull back from the scene and look across the water
just above the thump of industry we can hear a distinctive and irregular chugging sound
slowly a decrepit and eccentric little steam launch chugs into view
holmes is on the deck along with a much older man in a sailors hat captain tanner
everything all right captain tanner
captain tanner has few teeth and a large white beard
just a little leak nothing to worry about
watson is busy with a bucket clearing the boat of a very serious leak
hes soaked and furious
not a great one for the water are you doctor
army type arent you
you wouldnt have lasted long in the navy
holmes scans the banks with a telescope
he sees a jetty with a few shadows shifting on it
the engine shudders off the boat drifts
tanner whispers thats as far as we can go
holmes starts clambering over the side
there must be fifty yards of mud out there
holmes head is just visible before he drops over the prow
he whispers at tanner
pull in at vauxhall
send for the police when you get there
a soft splosh as holmes disappears
watson carefully leaves his valued possessions behind watch etc
he lays down his wallet and looks at tanner
i know precisely how much money is in there
taking the piss i am sure you do doctor
watson glares goes over the side with his walking stick
holmes and watson emerge out of the shallows covered in mud
holmes doesnt seem bothered
they look up and see a jetty that heads out into the river
two shadowy thugs guard the dock while more thugs are loading the boat with something
holmes and watson scuttle forward towards the entrance where two more thugs patrol
watson pulls out holmes what are you doing with my gun
it was an honest mistake there was nothing honest about it
holmes looks back at watson takes the gun says nothing the closest hell come to a confession
watson steps forward
come on lets get this over with
they look out at the thugs guarding the door
holmes whispers trying to figure out the best strategy
the one on the left seems more attentive might prove easily distracted
the big ones been drinking whether for courage or from habit
watson has already left
he simply walks up to the door and whacks the larger man in the face with the gun before dispatching the other with a backhand pistol whip
holmes follows notices that both men have hip flasks
he picks one up takes a whiff and pockets it as he follows watson
he slows sensing something behind him
he turns looks at shadows
and he enters holmes walks towards watson who stands in the doorway stopped in his tracks spooked
holmes catches up passing watson into shadows on shadows
metal groans softly like a plaintive wail
the twisted blades of slaughterhouse instruments glimmer in the darkness
a few rats lay dead
a truly creepy scene
holmes and watson move through it
as they go holmes notices rows of empty tables
he runs his finger through a layer of dust inspecting it
quiet they cleared something out of here not minutes ago
holmes slows picks up one of the dead rats
he inspects it sees something on its skin some kind of dark spore
you need to see this
holmes looks up and sees watson standing at a set of doors
holmes pulls out a cigar cutter clips off the rats tail slipping it into his pocket as he joins watson stepping into a massive space with a maze of machinery
full of deadly gears and blades and saws lifeless and silent for now
an automated butchery on a grand scale
this is the killing floor
huge hooks hang from chain belts on an i beam the ceiling swaying softly whispering in the wind
on the high walls a huge number has been scrawled
its a date a time
holmes shakes his head his eyes narrow ticking
its chapter and verse
i am he that liveth and was dead
another voice completes the passage echoing from above and behold i am alive forevermore and have the keys of hell and of death
holmes and watson follow the voice to see blackwood in the rafters
shadows hang heavy around him
holmes and watson react this is the first time theyve seen him in the flesh
i cautioned you to accept that this is beyond your control
now you see the truth for yourself
the hooks in the ceiling are shivering softly strangely
blackwood continues his voice echoes as the hooks move through the air gliding on a track
i want you to bear witness
at noon tomorrow the world as you know it ends
watson pulls his gun draws a bead on blackwood pulls the trigger
and because i appreciate your help holmes i have a gift for you
holmes starts climbing up towards blackwood
voice moving away she followed you
you led your little lamb straight to slaughter
suddenly the whole machine starts up
industrial strength loud movement everywhere empty hooks jerking towards the processing line
blades and gears and grinders churn
watsons eyes go from blackwood to a pig carcass as it comes swinging out of the killing area towards the scorcher which scorches the carcasses with live flame
then next carcass emerges not a carcass irene
she is alive for now
she hangs from two hooks on a track line her wrists shackled above her her mouth gagged
her eyes show terror until she sees them then immense relief for a moment then determination
holmes looks up to see blackwoods shadow retreating
holmes drops on to the machine and leaps from gear to gear like stepping stones
he heaves himself up to the conveyor where irene is being pulled down the assembly line towards the flames
watson sprints ahead looking for a shut off switch
holmes unties irenes gag
its your turn in shackles this time
ahead of them the pig carcass is scorched in an overwhelming burst of flame
holmes and irene are next
but this time no key unfortunately
holmes notes that irenes hands are shackled to separate hooks
its going to take two actions to free her
the flame machine gurgles ominously gearing up for the next blast
watson sees a lever please note new prop
that looks promising turns to head for it then his eyes focus on a big canvas splatter cloth
ive been meaning to ask you something well im a captive audience
watson rips down the splatter cloth sprints to holmes and irene tosses the cloth across the conveyor belt to holmes who wraps them up in the thick cloth just before
the flames hit them
the heat is excruciating but the cloth protects them
watson watches anxiously as the scorched cloth drops away revealing that holmes and irene made it just
relieved watson heads for the lever until oh shit
he looks ahead sees the scorched pig carcass being dragged into a long conveyor belt wide scalding tank of boiling water
decision time for watson help holmes and irene or try the lever
he goes for the lever reaches it pushes it all the way over and the belt speeds up with a jerk
watson hauls back on the lever gets the belt back to the original speed looks around for another possible off switch
just as they reach the scalding tank holmes jumps off the belt still opposite side to watson grabs irenes legs and pulls her horizontal just before shes dragged into the
shes suspended just above the boiling water with holmes moving sideways keeping pace with her
trying her best not to show the strain you had a question
holmes keeps hold of irenes feet as he maneuvers past various obstacles same ah
do you still maintain youre not in over your head
panting in some countries steam is considered excellent therapy for the skin
then is gouged in the back by a whirling fan belt jerks away and irene touches the water screams
watson hears the scream turns then sees something again
it pisses him off
fuck this machine
when holmes has irene stable again weakly i have to say its overrated
holmes has to admire her courage until he hears watson yelling at him
up ahead a huge pipe spews boiling water into the tank and impassable obstacle from holmes side of the conveyor belt
watson points at the i beam running above them
irene sees it too
holmes helps her reach one foot then other up to the i beam
she hooks her feet over it and is suspended upside down by her shackles and her feet and still heading for the pipe spewing boiling water
watson appears opposite holmes nods up at irene
she swings off the i beam through the air
and watson catches her feet pulls her horizontal facing the other way just in time to avoid the gush of boiling water
as watson holds irene he spots a small but significant looking switch on the wall painted red
please note watson helps irene back onto the conveyor belt leaves her for holmes to deal with sprints for the switch
irene rides the belt upwards
holmes clambers the equipment following her
up ahead the scorched scalded pig carcass precedes them
holmes darts through a trimming station with cleavers hanging from chains grabs one jumps onto the belt catches up to irene just as they both see the pig carcass cut
in half holmes wastes no time swings the meat cleaver at the lock shackling irenes left hand
sparks fly as metal kisses metal but thats all
shes still shackled
then both of them see that watson has reached the switch
watson looks at them with relief close one and pulls the switch down with a really satisfying clunk
a bank of lights goes out but the conveyor belt keeps moving towards the giant band saw
shit a brick
now shes showing nerves
so is sherlock
he braces himself on the belt swings the cleaver with all his might smashes the shackle lock
irene swings sideways violently still shackled by her right hand
the bandsaw whines viciously
irene swings aside just misses it
gets a free haircut
then holmes is under her lifting her high so that she can free her right hand a move not possible with both shackles
irene unhooks herself falls forward taking holmes with her
they plummet downwards out of frame
watson sprints towards where they fell looks down sees them lying on a carpet of scorched boiled cut in half pig carcasses
watson shakes his head turns heads for the door looking for blackwood
irene gives holmes a sweet grateful smile thank you so much
i owe you
pulls a knife gets up heads after watson
holmes grabs her stops her
you owe me information
angry no more games irene
she hears watson opening the door to the dock
she looks at holmes their eyes locking
finally the truth blackwoods manufactured large scale weapons for years
lately thereve been rumors of something new
more powerful than anything else
my job is to find out if the rumors are true
beat i would say they are
and shes off running toward the door
holmes trails her processing
they blast through the doors to watson runs out of doors and towards the end of the dock
he sees blackwood and the boat are disappearing into the darkness
holmes and irene run out of the doors following watson
holmes slows looking around the dock seeing something on the planks steel drums are dripping
holmes recognizes it
watson continues down the dock tripping a wire connected to the steel drums he turns realizing he has set off a trap and turns back to warn the others holmes
a metallic conductor sparks
the drums of chemicals all explode
a blinding conflagration engulfing watson
for a moment it lights up all of london
holmes is pushed back by the explosion as the rest of the barrels that line the dock begin exploding arond them it looks as it watson hasnt survived
irene is knocked to the ground by the blasts and flying debris
holmes races towards her as more explosions flames and debris fly all around him in slow motion occasionally knocking him to the ground
he reaches irene picks her up and grabs part of an exploded barrel to shield the two as they run for cover boom
the barrel splinters as a final blast knocks them down but to safety
as he opens his eyes
we see lestrade and his men swarming the scene they spot watson alive but unconscious
irene has disappeared
holmes sees this and heads toward his friend but is intercepted by constable clark
theres an order for your arrest all the way from the top sir so youll have to hit me now
from lord coward
yes sir so make it look good
thank you clarky
holmes cracks constable clark in the sweet spot helps him gently to his knees
holmes turns away makes his escape fast
holmes turns back to look at the explosion
two policemen half heartedly guard the end of a corridor
one reads the paper
the headline american ambassador mary returns past them having unsuccessfully washed away tear stained makeup there is a smear on her cheek
the two coppers nod respectfully
mary arrives at the windowed door of a private room reaches for the handle pauses
through the glass she sees a white coated doctor studying watsons chart
mary stays at the door unsure whether to enter or not
we see a newspaper on the nightstand next to a hospital bed the headline reads american ambassador standish watson is burned cut bruised scraped pock marked with shrapnel
he mumbles inaudibly his eyes still closed
hes delirious sweating
note marys detective novels and magazines coat handbag etc
already in the room
the doctor injects watson in the arm
the shot wakes him
watson tries to sit up wincing with pain
what are you administering
a sixth of a grain for the pain
watson looks at his wounded shoulder
there are four pieces of shrapnel
the surgeon should be along shortly
watson tries to sit up again
this reveals that mary has entered the room stands back respectfully letting the doctor do his work
are they subcutaneous or deeper
theyre near the carotid artery
get a mirror ill extract them myself
i cant authorize that doctor
we must first manage the pain and combat the infection
i havent time for that
my friend is in dire your friend
what kind of friend takes a retired soldier whos served his country and deserves a peaceful private life and puts him so directly in harms watson grabs the doctors arm
the best and wisest man ive ever known
but evidently not wise enough to value your life over his misadventures
as she takes a closer sharper look at the doctor
succumbing to the morphine it was worth a wound worth many wounds
mary steps towards the doctor eyes flashing
excuse me leaving i have other
do you really
the doctor turns just outside the door to face her
shes suddenly very angry
you have nothing more to say to me
ill check in on him again shortly
is that the best you can do
im disappointed but not surprised
the doctor has no words
if anything happens to him both our lives are lost
do you understand that
the doctor cant face her anger any longer turns leaves fast
or are you so selfish thats just not possible
the doctor strides down the corridor past the policemen
establishing shot of london possibly the bustle of fleet street during the morning rush hour
a train crosses on an overhead railway
we push in under the railway arch until we can make out a splash of white in the shadows the doctor from the hospital is slumped down against the wall
we push in all the way so that we can see that the doctor is actually holmes
there is something grotesque about his face he hasnt completely removed his disguise
parts of it hang down obscuring him but not obscuring the light of instability in his eyes
they begin to overflow with tears
he brushes them away then looks at his wet hand horrified
holmes enters disturbed pained
he pulls out a newspaper with the story of standishs death the pages and strange sacrificial offerings bone hair feather fang from sir thomas house
gathering himself holmes stands in the middle of the bare room and starts to lay out the clues he has on the floor
the ox bone directly in front of him at oclock
the eagle feather to his right at oclock
the human hair behind him at oclock and the lions fang to his left at oclock
then with a piece of charcoal holmes draws a circle around each image and a circle directly in the center of the four other circles
he then draws lines which join the circles together in the shape of a cross
in the center circle he draws a pentagram using wax from a burning candle
then he pours a ring of salt around that circle
he lights four candles one at each point of the cross then stands in the center of the circle
he pulls a pocket knife from his coat opens the blade cuts his thumb and allows the drops of blood to drip onto the ground just outside the circle
then he begins to chant
the words are eerily reminiscent of blackwoods chanting
suddenly one of the drops of blood bursts into flame in mid air as it hits the ground the circle around holmes ignites followed by a larger circle beyond that
and now it dawns on you you begin to recognize your part in his play
holmes snaps around blackwood has appeared behind him within the outer circle of flame
you see the path he chose for you
holmes sways fuzzy
he struggles to focus on blackwood
didnt you wonder why it was so easy to catch me
i told you i needed five lives for my resurrection
why would i take a sixth under st
holmes shakes his head he can barely see straight
unless i simply wanted to be caught by the great sherlock holmes
blackwood raises a sacrificial sword and swings at holmes head
so i could die on the biggest stage of all
you made me what i am
we see as blackwood swings the sacrificial sword at holmes head
it looks as if holmes has no time to react whoosh the sword wipes the frame we see a series of quick cuts has blackwood killed holmes or is he
hallucinating caught in the spell he conjured
his face covered with earth just as we saw reordon in his coffin
holmes eyes snap open he breathes in air as he comes to life we see events of the recent past flash through his mind
his face submerged in water inside a copper bath tub just as we saw sir thomas
holmes eyes snap open he breathes in air his face engulfed with flames just as we saw standish
writing and sweating on the bed in the attic
holmes sees a hazy image of irene
she leans over him smiling sweetly then wraps her hands around his neck and starts to strangle him
we see watson turning to warn holmes before exploding the sun is rising
holmes eyes open and we see watson or some deathly version of his old friend is sitting in the chair where blackwood appeared
watson leans closer into the light
a ghost or a man
he gestures towards the diagram on the floor
you look bloody awful
he writes something in his notebook
he is decidedly alive but with burn flashes cuts and bruises
his arm is in a sling
hes been through it
in the b
irene is at the fire heating some coffee
what about the shrapnel in your arm
watson shows him a piece of shrapnel took it out myself
mary said i had a lousy doctor
then tosses it away
they both smile
united in agony
quietly between them she brought you here
yes oddly it seems she might understand the power of partnership
they both look back over to irene who just finished loading her gun
the coffee seems ready so she pours a cup
the fair sex was always your department watson
irene walks over and hands holmes the cup
you know i dreamt that you were strangling me
i had to get you to pass out to settle down
they smile at their unique twisted understanding of one another
what time is it
its half past nine
holmes takes a drink of coffee
excellent brew but i believe my head requires something a bit stronger to clear the i brought you this
he hands holmes his violin
holmes takes it
watson and irene sit at a table the screech of a fiddle now comes from upstairs
the fiddlers owner from the pubs band is busy getting drunk with the money he has acquired
irene arrives with two pints puts one down in front of him sits opposite him with the other
watson looks from irene to the pint with open suspicion
could it be poisoned
he wouldnt put it past her
but then he decides thats absurd
he takes a sip
oh i poisoned that one
with your own venom no doubt
better a snake than a lap dog
theres a new field in the treatment of abnormal personalities its called psychology
it appears youre whats considered a para neurotic deviant with anti social proclivities
no doctor im simply a woman
beat understand that and youll have a happy marriage
alternate dialogue not quite doctor
let me make it simple for you with a lot fewer words im whats called a woman
beat understand that and youll have a happy marriage
as he plays the violin but not with a bow
he plucks it he strums it he makes strange atonal sounds as he stares at the ritual pattern hes laid out on the floor
flashes to various images of the sphinx that hes observed over the course of the investigation
he stands up and draws a sphinx in charcoal on the floor
then he moves to the ox bone a flash of sir thomas ring with the ox crest
he draws an ox in charcoal
next to the ox bone holmes writes sir thomas ox ring
next he moves to the feather a flash to an eagle in flight he quickly sketches an eagle
then to an american flag then to standish with his eagle topped cane
next to the feather he writes america
then he moves to the hair
he draws a mans face
flash to reordons red hair
next to it holmes writes man
then he moves to a lion fang
he sketches out a lion he thinks but no flashes
next to it he writes a big question mark
holmes returns to his violin
staring at the lion fang as if willing the flashes to come
the music stops
irene and watson notice the silence
they swap a glance
and holmes emerges
i need a map of london
holmes is excited electric
now that youre sitting comfortably i shall begin
my initial approach was far too narrow
when blackwood invited me to pentonville prison he suggested i widen my gaze and at minimum i have done just that
in fact i may well have reconciled thousands of years of theological disparity
but thats for another time
blackwoods method is based on a ritualistic mystical system that has been employed by the temple of the four orders for centuries
to fully understand this system to get inside it i re enacted the ceremony we interrupted in the crypt
with a few enhancements of my own
watson and irene shoot holmes knowing looks
my journey took me somewhat further down the rabbit hole than i had intended
yes your little white tail got rather dirty
but i have emerged enlightened
the fraternity who silently control the empire share the belief with the kings pharoahs and emperors of old that the sphinx was a door to another dimension a gateway to
immeasurable power he tosses watson the pages from sir thomas
it is made up of four parts the ox the lion the eagle and man he points out the individual parts of the sphinx covering other parts with his hand
we see the ox body lion paws eagle wings mans face
in sir thomas secret chamber i found the bone of an ox the tooth of a lion the feather of an eagle the hair of a man
watson throws the map down on the floor really flying now
now it is a widely held belief that within the architecture of the great cities are coded references to this system
he runs his finger over the map tracing the shape of a cross
then he picks up the charcoal and following the map draws a serpentine curve of the river thames straight through the middle of the cross that he drew on the
since he rose from the grave blackwood has killed three men
each murder was committed at a location that has a direct connection with the temple therefore the system
beat reordon the ginger midget represents man
we found his body here
he points to a spot on the map south of the thames
it corresponds to the point on the cross that holmes drew that has the hair oclock
then sir thomas master of the temple wore the ox ring
he died here
again the spot holmes points is directly north of the river and corresponds to the point on the cross that has the ox bone oclock
standish was ambassador to america where the eagle has been the national emblem for over a hundred years and not by coincidence
holmes points to the map
the headquarters of temple of the four orders where he died is here
he points to corresponding points on the map and on the cross
man ox eagle
he connects the dots on the map
they form three points of a cross
and last on the list the lion
holmes scribbles on a piece of paper
watson and irene step closer looking at the lions fang and then the map
correspondingly the map will tell us the location of blackwoods final act
their eyes widen as they realize what theyre seeing
what is the meaning of this circle
irene indicates the fifth circle holmes has drawn the point at which the other four come together
they look to where it would correspond to on the map right in the middle of the river
it is the fifth element the ethereal
that which cant yet be known
its right in the middle of the river thames
they hear doors slamming outside boots echoing
irene looks out the window sees police officers flooding the pub
holmes folds up his piece of paper hands it to watson
he quickly moves to a hatch in the floor
flings it open
irene jumps down
watson is about to follow her down
follow these plans
watson goes down
it looks as though holmes is about to join them when lestrade and his men burst into the room
holmes kicks the hatch closed and steps towards lestrade
holmes races down the hall toward the back door but the door explodes inward
police fill the hall
holmes looks back where more police block his path
he simply raises his arms and they drag him away
holmes sits battered cuffed and bruised though we can see from his face that his spirits are unaffected by his physical state
tough looking cops sit either side of him lestrade sits opposite shaking his head he cant believe its come to this
he looks at holmes
pull back from an image of a golden lion on a banner
were at the houses of parliament
the carriage pulls up
crowds are gathering outside hawkers and tourists plenty of flags and enthusiasm
holmes sees the hands of big ben climbing toward noon
the place is a hive of activity preparing for pomp and circumstance at its ceremonial best
all of which is in stark contrast to the battered figure of holmes who is marched through a series of doors and checkpoints along the corridors of power by an
angry looking lestrade
they come to a door
the door is opened by lord coward whos halfway through putting on his official robes and caught off guard by the sight of holmes cuffed hands behind him and flanked
by lestrade and men
begging your pardon mlord i know its unorthodox but mr
holmes has been making serious accusations about you and the order sir
lestrade pulls his lapel revealing a temple of four orders pin
oh that solves the great mystery as to how you became inspector
lestrade punches holmes
i have five minutes before my next engagement why dont you regale me with your stories of conspiracies
thank you lestrade if you could wait outside
lestrade leaves and shuts the door
im curious coward did you assist blackwood in all the murders or just the one i prevented
very distinctive those hand made shoes of yours but the price of quality is the unique imprint they leave
coward walks towards his desk at one end of the room
holmes goes to warm himself by the fire at the other end
nonetheless i confess to being completely out matched
i could deduce very little from my investigation
coward turns away for a moment holmes subtly kicks a log from the fire it starts to smolder and fill the room with smoke
fortunately there is nothing more stimulating than a case where everything goes against you
how many members of parliament do you intend to murder at noon today
beat man ox eagle lion the lion is parliament isnt it
lord coward slows looks at holmes in some astonishment
but its not murder mr
we are giving the weak masses a strong shepherd
dont you see its for their own good
smoke fills the room so that holmes is concealed
coward pulls a gun from the desk and moves to the window
he opens it to try and clear the smoke
no but i dont care much what you think
i simply wanted to know the location of blackwoods final ceremony and now you have given it to me
i have told you nothing
a pair of handcuffs slide across the floor to cowards feet
he looks up and holmes is nowhere to be found
coward quickly moves across the room to lock the door
but your clothes say infinitely more than you ever hope
the mud smeared on your boots from where youve been walking
that hes changed out of and discarded in the corner of the room
we see a cowards heel walking through mud
a touch of red stock brick dust on your knee from where youve been kneeling
cowards knee dropping to the ground
a small bandage on your thumb from where youve been vowing
coward performing a ritual
a faint aroma of excrement from where you have been standing
coward blackwood and the temple members perform a ritual around a pentagram in the sewers
the big ceremonial sword is prominent
its a shame you made an enemy out of blackwood holmes you would have made a valuable ally
the powers at our disposal are far greater than you can imagine
you and blackwood laid the final touches to your ceremony in the sewers beneath parliament less than an hour ago
both houses met today
the entire government will be present
how terrible is wisdom holmes when it brings no profit to the wise
turning to holmes we take power at noon
reveal holmes sitting in a chair behind coward
well theres no time to waste then is there
coward spins around and shoots at holmes
holmes runs towards the open window as coward fires another shot
with a single bound holmes leaps out of the window coward opened
coward runs to the window and sees holmes diving toward the river thames plummeting down down down to splash
holmes dives into the river handcuffed
he disappears for a moment then surfaces looks about in the water
a moment of concern until we hear the familiar chug of a struggling engine
holmes looks in the water and sees a rope trailing on the surface
he grabs it with his hands
it pulls him closer to the rickety boat of captain tanner
watson stands on the rear deck pulling holmes in on the rope
irene is also present
when holmes is level watson leans over and clips off his cuffs using bolt cutters
clearly the whole escape has been planned
holmes is pulled up into the boat
to watson i told you hed be coming out the top window soldier boy
no way hed be coming over the terrace
watson hands over the change from the engagement ring
tanner takes it happily
how was lestrade
performed his role perfectly
a little too perfectly come to think of it
watson has the paper that holmes gave him in the attic
well your instructions were fairly precise
about everything except the window
tanner smiles still pleased with himself
where to sherlock
holmes points to a dark recess in the embankment
port side captain tanner into the sewers
tanner turns the boat
irene looks out her eyes narrow
watson did you bring my clothes
watson hands over a pile of clothes and holmes pistol
holmes opens the drum checks the load grimaces pockets it
hes never going to like guns
then holmes reaches inside a pocket of clothes he is still wearing and pulls out the hip flask that he took from the men at the slaughterhouse
he takes a shot
starting early arent we
he offers the flask to her
trust me have a drink
she can see this is more than a social invitation she takes a hit pulls a face
holmes nods towards watson irene passes him the bottle
he drinks grimaces hands it on to tanner who swallows it without flinching wipes his mouth smiles
the boat is almost at the sewers
what are we doing in the sewers
i am about to show you
as they head toward the sewers holmes glances up toward big ben the time moving toward noon
expensive carriages fill the courtyard
the entire government is here
we see familiar faces from the temple of four orders heading into this epic building
tanners boat unlit floats at the opening to the tunnel on the edge of the darkness
far as i can go
holmes and watson leap off the boat into the mouth of the sewer
watson has his sword stick and a gun holmes has changed into the clothes watson brought for him
they move through the shadowy sewer tunnels working their way around corners and through junctions back under the houses of parliament
holmes ducks around a corner stops
irene and watson flank him standing in shadows
they look down a long tunnel to the area where coward and blackwood were seen in the flashback ceremony with the sword
but now blackwoods thugs patrol the area
in the center the pentagram remains
but there is something sitting in it a futuristic device behold blackwoods magic
a black glass cylinder is housed in a metal cradle with electrodes on either side
it sits below a shattered ceiling bricks dismantled exposing a ventilation pipe
holmes looks back at watson and irene
quiet a chemical weapon
the first of its kind
cyanide to be precise
you can tell that from here
i can tell it from here
he pulls something out of his pocket the rat tail
i snipped this off a rather recumbent rat at the slaughterhouse
note the blue discoloration the faint smell of bitter almonds
tell tale signs of cyanide
he points at the device and the exposed shaft over it
that shaft leads directly to parliament
when activated those electrodes on either side will send a charge converting the cyanide powder into a gas
all of the people inside that building will be dead at the strike of noon
as if by magic
there will be no one left to stop blackwood and his followers from assuming control
the camera moves through the shattered ceiling up a channel down a bend all the way through a grate to air blows up through the grate
the chamber is now full of lords and senior royals
as they start to take seats lord coward steps up checks the crowd
he sees a shadow up in the lords gallery
holmes checks his watch
seven minutes to twelve
shoulder to shoulder they move down the tunnel faster and faster
irene trails them closely
watson slides his sword stick into a loop on his belt
its there when he needs it out of the way otherwise
they draw their guns
they burst into the area completely surprising the three thugs
watson pistol whips the nearest
holmes front kicks the next
the third thug looks down the barrels of both their guns before he has a chance to fight or flee
irene comes in behind them and heads straight for the device
ill keep these under wraps
holmes hands watson his gun
gun in each hand watson herds the three thugs away from the device
sullen but without much resistance they move away two dragging the pistol whipped one who is out
watson turns so that he can watch the action at the device which puts his back to another tunnel
holmes joins irene at the device
she grips her knife looking for a way to detach the cylinder from the cradle where electric coils and circuits pulse
ive never seen anything like it
theres never been anything like it
a totally wire free weapon
he must have some kind of remote device sending a signal to the receiver
really quite she reaches out with her knife and
her blade hits a coil sparks flashing
electrocuted she drops the knife which falls into the cradle surrounded by humming sparking coils
irene recoils sees something past holmes where dredger looms out of the dark behind him both hands held high to grab the guns and smash watson
before irene can alert him watsons wrists are crushed from behind
dredger jerks watsons arms sideways sending both guns spinning away holmess gun splashes into the sewer
dredger spins watson around head butts him with a teeth rattling blow flings watson away like a discarded paper cup
now unguarded the two conscious thugs charge holmes and irene
irene shoots one point blank with her derringer holmes crushes the others larynx
to irene keep at it
holmes goes for dredger
lords and royals sit in this august hall waiting for the session to begin
coward looks up and points very emphatically
all eyes rise to see blackwood up in the lords gallery
the hall goes silent staring at a ghost
blackwood is calm commanding
voices rise blackwoods followers move to block the doors as bong
the first chime of noon from big ben
the chime echoes
dredger charges towards the device and irene
holmes flies into him feet first deflecting him for a moment
it is now clear that dredgers sole purpose is to protect the device
irene sits at the device trying to figure out how to defuse it
the second chime resounds
dredger grabs holmes thrusts him upwards against the sewer roof simultaneously strangling him and hammering him against the bricks hard enough to dislodge some
holmes lashes out with his feet at dredger who doesnt even bother to block anything
holmes kicks lose steam as he loses air
without looking up nine strokes left
dredger grins until he is earholed from behind by two bricks swung with full force by watson
dredger drops holmes staggers back holding his bleeding ears
holmes heads back to irene
watson draws the sword from his sword stick
deadly enough but not very big
you owe me for the ring
dredger backs off as if scared of the sword but only until he can reach up and pull blackwoods ceremonial sword down off a brick ledge
this is going to be more uneven than usual
as watson parries dredgers massive slashes and thrusts all around them only just keeping dredger at bay holmes sees that the cylinder is welded onto the cradle by two rods
his eyes narrow a plan forming
give me your gun
the bullets i need the bullets
the clock is ticking down
irene pops open her derringer slides the bullets into holmes hand
he chops open the bullet casings with his knife pouring the gunpowder into the bowl of his pipe
watson ducks a whooshing cut lunges with his little sword sticks it into the meat of dredgers bicep
dredger grunts angrily flexes his bicep rips the sword out of watsons grasp with his muscle then he pulls it out snaps the blade against the wall like a twig
and moves in to cut watson in two with the ceremonial sword from head to toe
watson dives desperately gets a haircut from the sword
which shatters against the floor
while watson is down dredger punts him into the sewer with a splash then turns back to the device
blackwood has lit four small red candles placed them on the balustrade in front of him
he calmly intones a familiar chant
lords are on their feet
guards are banging outside the doors but the doors are locked
members of the temple of four orders stand in front of anyone going to open them
holmes rips the stem off his pipe places the open end of the bowl against the bolt holding the cylinders in place
shaped charge victorian style
we need a light a match irenes eyes narrow seeing something in the cradle her knife
she rolls up a sleeve
which is when a blood maddened dredger thunders into them both arms wide driving holmes and irene away from the device hammering them into the wall with a mighty thud
then he braces his massive feet angles his huge legs and pushes squeezes them against the wall like a human vice
thats the extent of dredgers plan and it will work for long enough because breath crushing out of her three
the batteries begin to fizz madly cams turn gears ratchet past each other
dredger turns his head so that he can see watson on his belly crawled from the sewer where he found holmes bam
four white phosphorous tracers strobe through the sewer stitch a line down dredgers back aimed so as not to hit holmes or irene on the through and through and continue
to burn inside dredger
he lurches away eyes bulging mouth wide with a silent scream
holmes and irene stagger for the device
fizzling boiling inside the dying giant falls like a tree
watson is face down on the stones still
the gun falls out of his limp hand
irene swipes her hand down into the cradle just barely avoiding the sparks and coils snatching her blade and
a spark hits the blade and she angles the blade redirecting the spark toward holmes pipe which blows with a vicious crack
the shaped charge shears the steel rods
holmes and irene reach for the cylinders
blackwood stands on balcony looking down at the assembled lords
you seem surprised
did you really take me for a man who could be dispatched like a truculent servant
i see before me a conspiracy of arrogant old men puffed up by the illusion of their own vainglory
in your hands this once great parliament has become nothing more than a drunken satyr stumbling about the worlds stage seeking nothing more than to satiate your own lust and
gluttony your britches stained by the incontinence of your hypocrisy
i will not sit idly by and watch you violate the innocence of the public trust as you drag this great empire into the quagmire that your pride has dug
and filled with the excrement of your corruption
i am here to change all this
he raises his hand and traces a circle in the air
a circle of flame erupts on the opposite wall
i am the fourth horseman
he raises his hand and traces a triangle in the air
a triangle of flame erupts on the opposite wall
i am the pale rider
he raises his hand and traces a second triangle in the air
the second triangle of flame erupts on the opposite wall to complete the pentagram within the circle
and my name to you is death
the electrical charge zaps through the device electrodes sizzle sending blinding sparks through the cradle
holmes and irene rip the cylinder out of the way just as
the sparks collide in a blinding flash and
the clock strikes twelve
the men wait for something mythic magical
nothing at all
they look around
everyone is still standing
coward looks confused scared
other temple members eye him
blackwood hits the remote again
but again nothing happens
we see something new in his eyes fear
he ducks away fast disappearing into the gallery
holmes and irene look each other in the eye
for the first time neither knows what to say
that was something new for us
she looks past holmes
holmes whips around sees watson seemingly dead
he goes to him drops to his knees next to watson feels for a pulse
with his face still pressed to the stones im pretty sure i heard the last chime
holmes looks down at his friend relieved
yes we made it
watson rolls over sits up
hes done had enough
come on youve got to admit youre going to miss this
the stench of the sewers or the broken bones
beat my ankles done
watson looks around
holmes turns looks
the cylinders are gone and so is irene
his face darkens
he misread her yet again
holmes im sorry
holmes sees irenes lithe shadow moving fast into a maze of tunnels
he motions to the disabled device
make sure lestrade keeps it intact
he watches holmes sprint into the darkness face grim
blackwood flashes downward through the ornate official understory of the houses heads for a staircase spiralling even further down
irene hears holmes angry footsteps behind her turns sees a flash of movement through the labyrinth of tunnels and columns
she picks up speed
blackwood enters the maze of tunnels hears then sees irene sprint across the maze about yards away
blackwood follows them
sees something on the ground ahead pauses
its watsons sword stick flung there from the previous action with dredger
blackwood scoops it up
panting irene runs along a tunnel that steps lower and pinches tighter
a large diameter water pipe angles down the tunnel wall forcing irene to turn sideways to continue
the sound of holmes footsteps drives her forward
and then the tunnel ends
the water pipe breaks off jaggedly in mid air next to irenes head
the continuation of the pipe passes through solid brick at the end of the tunnel a dark claustrophobic gamble
irene hesitates for a moment then slithers into the pipe into the unknown
the pipe angles down damp horrible
for a long moment it is pitch black pinched down
irenes quick anxious breath the only point of reference
this is as tight subterranean dark and nightmarishly claustrophobic as it gets
then almost imperceptibly light
we can make out irenes determined profile
light increases and so does irenes rate of movement
the pipe emerges from the brick wall in what looks to be the cellar of a building
stonework fairly new
dim daylight from an unseen opening shows a fixed ladder heading upwards
irene accelerates for it
holmes grimaces enters the pipe shimmies towards us
an even tighter fit for him
irene climbing with one hand cylinders in the other reaches an iron grate has to use all her strength to shoulder it aside
as fit and athletic as she is this is a grind
irene emerges at the base of a dark hollow building full of construction equipment and sees yes more stairs upward
the only ready way out
gritting her teeth chest heaving irene charges the stairs just as holmes pops out of the pipe vaults onto the fixed ladder and swarms up it
anger lends him energy
irene finally makes it to a floor in the building that is flooded with sky bright daylight
she surges for light a brick framed window and
of irene at the top of tower bridge
shes climbed up the inside of the tower
shes feet above the thames
weve gone straight from maximum claustrophobia to maximum knee buckling exposure
pull back and sweep into a massive near degree helicopter shot that starts with irene at the unfinished window then shows the skeletal bridge spanned tenuously with scaffolding then the
glory of london the center of the world laid out for us in breathtaking spectacular beauty and returns to irene as recovered somewhat she darts onto the walkway scaffolding that crosses above the thames
irene works her way through the construction debris on the bridge
she makes it to the end no further to go
sherlock appears behind her winded
its bad manners to leave without at least saying goodbye
he start to move towards her
she whips out her gun
you of all people know i will pull this trigger
they circle around each other
id tell you im sorry that i wish things could be different but you wouldnt believe me anyway
why hurry off give it a try
he moves in again
she shoots him in the arm
and in that split second blackwood drops down from behind irene hits her with watsons sword stick
she drops stunned
as she falls blackwood plucks the cylinder out of her hand and kicks her gun away
her gun goes flying off the side of the bridge
but irene doesnt pause she swings her legs through the air trying to take out blackwoods knees
but he swipes her legs away and kicks down and youre better off without her holmes
high above a raven lands
a look between them and then its on
holmes grabs a short section of wooden batten out of the railing
flimsy no match for the sword which is immediately apparent as blackwood comes in slashes chops six inches off the batten
i planned to kill a handful of senile old men to make this empire strong
but now because of you thousands are going to die
holmes is on the defensive throughout but as before his target is the cylinder first blackwood second self defense third
all i have to do is break this cylinder
the wind will do the rest
and youll be the first
the two men continue their swordfight holmes grabs some rope hanging from the scaffolding above and swings off the bridge
blackwood steps to the edge with his sword out awaiting holmes
holmes swings towards the blade and then pushes off the bridge once again to avoid it
holmes swings back onto the bridge a few feet away from blackwood
he lands whips off his scarf and twirls it around blackwoods arm binding them together
they continue to spar now bound
blackwood snarls mounts a frenzied attack which holmes simply tries to survive
the two men finally part with holmes cast off towards the end of the bridge
he grabs holmes gun which blackwood knocked from irenes hand earlier
blackwood fires at holmes
holmes quickly ducks
the bullet misses him but hits a bucket twirling above his head
a black liquid tar begins to pour out in a circle around him
holmes turns as if to flee not that theres anywhere to go his eyes lock on to something
he looks back to blackwood
holmes kicks a huge scaffolding plank which falls whipping a coil of rope across the floor hooking blackwood around his ankle
blackwood is dragged down the walkway by the weight of the falling plank pulled toward the edge
holmes grabs the cylinders as blackwood passes
blackwood digs his fingers into a gap screeching to a painful halt
his fingers are white from strain
holmes remains cool
there was never any magic
only conjuring tricks
above holmes the raven starts pecking at a rope
the simplest involved paying people off like the prison guard
holmes looks over the edge of the walkway
he sees the plank swinging dangerously in the storm
blackwood strains desperately to hold on
as holmes steps closer we intercut with relevant flashbacks
guard choking payoff who pretended to be possessed outside your cell
your reputation and your jailers fear did the rest
burial ground licking rocks others required more elaborate preparation like the sandstone slab that covered your tomb
you had it broken before your burial then put back together using a mild adhesive
an ancient egyptian recipe i believe a mixture of egg and honey
designed to be washed away by the rain or eaten by animals
bath reordon flashback arranging for your father to drown in his own bathtub required more modern science
very clever of reordon to find a paralytic that was activated by the combination of copper and water and was therefore undetectable once the bath water was drained
that might have been quite challenging had he not also tested it on some unfortunate amphibians
standish in rain pulling the trigger wharf explosion the death of standish was a real mystery until you used the same compound to blow up the wharf
an odorless tasteless flammable liquid yet it burned with an unusual pinkish hue
did standish mistake it for rain as he entered your temple
all it took was a spark
a simple rigged bullet in his gun
parliament flask ceremony dev ice like all great performers you saved your piece de resistance for the end
had it worked your followers in parliament would have watched unharmed as their colleagues were dying around them
they didnt know that you had given them the antidote at one of your ceremonies i suspect
instead they would have believed it was magic and that you harnessed the ultimate power
blackwood struggles to hold on he loses his grip for a second and is dragged back toward the precipice
wind whips harder
holmes doesnt notice the ravens rope snaps starting a slow subtle domino effect in b
a bucket drops hits a row of standing timbers
the timbers start to topple
note each time one object strikes another we hear a faint musical note moving up the same pentatonic scale that holmes played earlier for his flies
you hated your father and the other members of the temple of the four orders for what they did to you
how satisfying it must have been to use their own system against them
we see the slow inexorable dominoes continue to fall
the last timber falls over the edge lands on a rope
the rope yanks down a crane the crane swings strikes another crane
cut me loose holmes
blackwoods eyes are full of fear
holmes thoughtfully looks out at the angry storm the atmosphere electric and dangerous
holmes gives the slightest hint of a smile
you better hope that its nothing more than superstition as you performed all the rituals perfectly
holmes looks around at the gathering storm
blackwood can hold on no longer
he screams as he releases his grip and is torn down the walkway at breakneck speed
quick as a snake holmes grabs a workmans ax placed on the side and hurls it at his feet cutting the rope
blackwoods imminent death is brought suddenly to a halt
the storm grows in ferocity
holmes bends down blackwood is on his knees cowed
first the world will see you for what you are
then you will hang
properly this time
blackwood looks up
the crane dislodges a metal girder which misses holmes by inches as it crashes through the floorboards blackwood smirks
well see about that shall we
its a long journey from here to the rope
holmes looks up
blackwood looks up
well see about that shall we
the top of the crane crashes down
the wooden infrastructure supporting blackwood falls away
sending blackwood falling into a lattice of hanging chains below
blackwood screams as the chains begin to snap off one by one
he falls farther
and finally snap
the last chain catches tightens around blackwoods neck killing him instantly
blackwood dangles on the rusty chain hanged like a common man after all with tower bridge as his gibbet
holmes just stands there stunned
he looks out to see the raven flying away a silhouette against the stormy sky
the bird flaps its wings disappearing into a cloud
his brow furrows
perhaps there really are some things that cannot be explained
holmes looks over the side of the bridge sees irene is awkwardly splayed on the lower level
she appears to be dead possibly a small trickle of blood is coming out of her mouth
holmes moves down to her
he takes her hand
his fingers move to take her pulse
her eyes pop open
irene makes a quick move she tries to cuff him
but this time holmes is ready for it he reverses the move cuffing her instead
he takes a seat next to her
they sit there for a beat an odd lovers moment looking out over the thames
it looks like rain
weve still got a moment
a bit of a smile and break
you were right he is a professor
keys in the watch pocket
holmes reaches over to grab the key
their faces close near a kiss
holmes drops the keys down the top of her shirt just as she dropped them down his pants
he snatches the diamond from around her neck turns and walks away
she smiles calls out youll miss me sherlock
holmes walks away pauses to pick up watsons sword stick keeps walking
at the end of the top of the stairs
holmes hands the cylinder to one of the policemen
rain falls softly
itll be a hell of a trick if blackwood comes back from this one
thank you lestrade
now youre going to be even more arrogant and insufferable than ever
then lestrade cracks a smile
youre welcome detective
beat is the woman up there
she wont be by the time your boys get there
holmes keeps moving into the night
the storm curls around him the rain falling hard
and he sees
a shadow is waiting for him
we recognize the figure of watson
holmes cant help but smile
he joins watson no words spoken
holmes holds out watsons sword stick
watson takes it
the two of them stand looking out down the thames
mary and watson walk towards b
a driver loads watsons boxes into a carriage that waits in front of the apartment
watson takes a quick look in one of the boxes
please make sure this one is put on the desk in the front room
whats in all those notebooks
just a few scribbles
cases weve worked on over the years
all your adventures
id love to read them sometime
watson laughs then pauses for a moment to consider this idea before they enter
as watson and mary climb the stairs it becomes clear that mary now wears irenes diamond on her finger
holmes had it made into an engagement ring
i still cant believe hes given us that ring
do you think hes finally come to terms with you leaving
no question about it watson opens the door of holmes apartment revealing a horrific scene holmes is hanging from a rope his back to them
he looks dead
dont panic dear
watson and mary step in but do nothing to help holmes
suicide is not in his repetoire hes far too fond of himself
watson pokes him
turns him around
i was trying to deduce the manner in which blackwood survived his execution
clearing your good name as it were
but it had a surprisingly soporific effect and i was carried off in the arms of morpheus like a caterpillar in a cocoon
get on with it holmes
cleverly concealed in the hangmans knot was a hook i believe my legs have fallen asleep
i should probably come down
shouldnt you help him john
i hate to stop when hes on a roll
do carry on holmes
watson and mary walk by
the executioner attached it to a harness thus allowing the weight to be distributed around the waist and the neck to remain intact
my lord i cant feel my cheeks
might we continue this at ground level
how did you manage it holmes
i managed it with braces belts and a coat hook
please watson my tongue is going next
ill be of no use to you at all
worse things could happen
watson draws his sword
but none of this explains the lack of a pulse
he finally uses his sword stick and slices holmes down
holmes tumbles to the ground
there is a toxin refined from the nectar of the rhododendron ponticum
it is quite infamous in the region of turkey bordering the black sea for its ability to induce an apparently mortal paralysis
enough to mislead a medical mind even as tenacious and well trained as your own
it is known locally as whats wrong with gladstone
mad honey disease
stiff as a board
he is demonstrating the very effect ive just described
he doesnt mind
his heart should be ticking in no time
watson feels for a pulse in his dogs neck he shakes his head
they are interrupted by a knock on the door
constable clark enters
inspector lestrade asks that you come with me right away
what is it this time clarky
its one of our sergeants sir
he went missing in the sewers the day you stopped lord blackwood
well a maintenance man found his body this morning
we believe the sergeant was our first man on the scene
shot in the head
were there powder burns on his eyebrows
point blank range
with small caliber bullet
holmes and watson look at each other complete change of demeanor mind racing looking concerned
the dog has regained its vital signs
theres a brave boy
there there everythings going to be all right
where is blackwoods device now
the secret service has it sir
theyve taken over the case
piecing it together id wager theres a piece missing
constable clarke nods
holmes pulls his coat on
so youre saying moriarty was after a part of the machine and not the poison
the wire free invention was the game all along
imagine being able to control any device simply by sending a command via radio waves
adler was just a diversion
mary looks at watson who is clearly trying to curb his enthusiasm and interest
the driver pokes his head in
to watson ive loaded the last of your boxes sir
watson nods the driver exits
watson turns to holmes
ill leave with you
clarky case reopened
we follow policemen heading into the sewer tunnel
they spread out to seal the crime scene where holmes had dismantled blackwoods device
we believe sergeant smith was the first officer there
sergeant smith sees a policeman leaning over the device
oi what you doing
the policeman looks up and a gun slides into his hand by means of the same device we saw in the carriage scene with irene
we dont see his face
shot in the head
were there powder burns on his eyebrows
he was shot at point blank range
holmes and watson look at each other complete change of demeanor mind racing looking concerned
the dog has regained its vital signs
theres a brave boy
there there everythings going to be all right
where is blackwoods device now
the secret service has it sir
theyve taken over the case
piecing it together id wager theres a piece missing
i thought those days were behind you
excellent deduction however
removes a small receiver like object from blackwoods device
constable clark nods
holmes pulls his coat on
moriarty was after the machine not the poison
blackwoods wire free invention was the game all along
it is undoubtedly the more dangerous and the more valuable of the two
wistful irene was just a diversion
mary looks at watson who is clearly trying to curb his enthusiasm and interest
the man from the stairs pokes his head in
to watson ive loaded the last of your boxes sir
watson nods the driver exits
watson turns to holmes
ill walk out with you
mary and gladstone wait for watson in the carriage
holmes and watson stand in the doorway
a stiff beat
holmes extends an awkward hand
an honor working with you doctor
watson shakes holmes hand puts a hand on his arm
a warm look an understanding between the two men
take care of yourself holmes
watson moves to the open door of the carriage but mary stops him
try not to be too late for dinner with my parents and
she waves to holmes as the carriage pulls away
watson looks relieved and excited
magnificent woman watson
they climb into constable clarkes black mariah which pulls away down baker st
we pull back from the carriage wide and up like our opening on baker street perhaps the pov of the raven
