href b b copycat third draft by frank pierson participating writers ann biderman jay presson allen the hall is full
on the stage dr
helen hudson is speaking
helen is a forensic psychologist
behind her is a projected diagram predisposition dissociation trauma fantasy violent fantasy facilitators murder and trauma reinforcement which she can point to with a laser pointing device
we see her from a considerable distance
the back of the balcony
her voice is crisp and assured
our society creates these socially and psychically disenfranchised men and their revenge on society is terrible
they are hard to catch
they are the nice guy next door their employers if they work at all find them quiet and uncomplaining
early abuse and rejection have taught them passivity
only in their violent fantasies do they feel alive
what they seek in their frenzied assaults on their victims is relief from passivity
for these men ten minutes relief is worth far more than the life of another human being
torture the pain they inflict the screams of the victim are all part of the ritual that gives them a brief respite from their own psychic pain
and then the depression the forgetting the feeling of sadness and despair begins the cycle all over again
like addicts seeking their drug albert desalvo bianchi and buono berkowitz dahmer bundy they seek out their next victim
during the second half of this speech the eye of the camera has moved slowly forward until it settles just behind the balcony railing
the cycle is endless until they are caught
and they are caught by chance they run a red light and a body is in the trunk
a leaking pipe brings a plumber to a basement where they is the smell of death
her eyes have come to rest on the spot of the camera eye in the balcony
her voice chokes off
sitting in the front row of the balcony a young red headed man daryll lee cullum leans forward resting his tattooed arms on the railing
he smiles intimately at helen
helen cuts her eyes to the left
she sees backstage an overweight cop in plain clothes
instantly alert to helens alarm he jumps up comes within an inch of exposing his presence to the audience
a second cop in the wings on the other side of the stage also springs to attention
first cops eyes follow helens
their pov the balcony young red headed man is no longer there
helen can she believe her eyes
resumes at any time right now as you listen the fbi estimates there are to serial killers stalking their victims
the serial killer is a plaque that must be addressed not only by the law but by science
florida spent eight million dollars to execute ted bundy
it would have been better spent building a forensic penal facility devoted to research
once again her eyes fix on the balcony to reassure herself that the smiling man is not there
confined for life without parole and subjected to scientific study these mens lives might finally in some small measure educate and thereby protect society
applause as helen warily checks for the two cops
they are carefully casing the crowd
the crowd is breaking up
first cop walks helen to the ladies room
people reach to shake helens hand she copes as well as she can with her fear
they leave the stage the cop clearly embarrassed pokes his head in and looks around
under one stall he sees a womans high heels
he hastily ducks back into hall and signals an okay to helen
before the door behind her closes we see the cop prepare to stand guard outside
helen walks past the stall with the high heels to a stall several doors down
and a tattoo that the cop missed seeing on one of the ankles
the shoes are kicked off
the feet disappear from view as helen a few stalls away methodically places toilet paper around the seat before raising her skirt
a faint noise makes her freeze
her hand reaches for the door
she is just able to unlock it but no more before a noise comes like a lariat it falls over helens head and is violently yanked tight
she kicks at the stall door
corridor cop leaning against outside door smoking hears the clang of metal as the stall door bangs open
the red headed man is struggling to secure the rope around a hook inside his own stall
are you okay in there
the man lets slip a little slack
helens fingers thrusting between the rope and her neck get just enough air for helen to let out a strangled little scream
corridor cop not certain what to do about the ambiguous sounds from inside
women stands nearby inhibiting him for a split second from going in the ladies room door
now there is more sound from inside
cop steps into the room gun down
over the cops shoulder we see helen hanging in open booth her hand fluttering at her throat
she has one slippery shoeless foot on the toilet seat
cop takes a couple of steps forward
behind cops back we see a broom closet door opening
helens pov close up the cop taken from behind
in a second his throat is slit
in a gush of blood he falls his gun still in his hand
red headed man standing over the fallen cop smiling at cops body is twitching jerking
the violent contractions in his fingers cause the gun to go off
two shots the sound reverberating against the tile walls
the audience and second cop react to the gunshots
helen her eyes bulging struggling against the rope
as helen in bed bolts up from the nightmare her hands try desperately to pull the dream rope from her neck
she is now pale her hair is dirty there are deep circles under her eyes
this is a woman in the throes of a breakdown
she races through this loft apartment the walls are eight feet under a twelve foot ceiling to study opening off a hall
she looks in gasping for breathing
the room is neat nobody there
we will later see that it is used on and off by her computer andy
helen whimpers in frustration she is alone
she talks to herself as she turns back and moves past a living room where she turns on lights and the tv flicks on court tv
the sound comes up loud
she moves on
trying to calm herself with the sound of her own voice
it is october twelfth in the city of san francisco california u
the strongest richest most stable and happiest country in the world
that is the sole place of life in the universe
close xanax bottle
two pills are shaken out into a palm others scattering from the nervous haste
close helen watching herself in bathroom mirror as she tosses down the pills gulps water
she regards her haggard reflection with a certain detachment
what happened to you
she barks a rueful laugh
we are seeing a woman will herself from near hysteria to relative calm
hall as she exits the bathroom
and moves into her office
she pours herself a brandy and stands before two computers
of the side by side computer screens one is blank
the other shows a chess setup
flashing on the bottom of the screen comes a command
its almost seven
make a goddam move
she studies the chess set up for a moment then makes a move
she has not even hit the keyboard of the other computer before chessmaster sends another message
not really into this game helen
lets drop it
ive got a feeling about you
like a date
helen types the following to chessmaster
im a terrible date
id mess up your life
another romantic dream gone all to hell
maybe its better to just dream on avoid the disappointments of life
come on move
she pushes a button on the remote and we see the window curtains open
bright sunlight streams in
we see that the t shirt helen wears says shrinks r us
she crosses to the window with her glass of cognac looks out
a sweeping view of the bay and across to marin county
the morning sun is dispelling the last of the nights fog
helen opens window puts a hand outside trying to feel the air the freedom
feeling quite restored from the dream horror of the night
close phone her hand comes into frame and picks up the handset and carries camera to closeup helen
listens you son of a bitch
son of a bitch
stiff with fear and rage she slams down phone
you filthy son of a bitch on the computer screen behind her the chessmaster makes his move the computer speaks in its tiny computer voice filter you queen is in
protect your queen
home movie of a young woman dressed in a seat suit
it is morning and she is jogging on a park path
her hair is in a long braid
she is sweating breathing heavily clearly near the end of a satisfactory run
the target it is a silhouette of a mans head and torso centered in the right side of the upper chest near the shoulder is a small red circle
still smoking the holes from the bullets are scattered all over the chest and none in the circle
my third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that
yeah but she had divine guidance
we now take in the shooter ruben and his companion m
is a small deceptively vulnerable looking young woman
she is neat buttoned down crisp
appears to be about twenty five
she is in fact thirty four and a homicide inspector with the rank of sergeant
she is usually dressed in slacks and a loose sweater or an oversize jacket that helps make her appear even smaller and younger than she is
ruben goetz is also in homicide about twenty six and junior in authority to m
ruben is good looking good humored and laid back
he has a cellular phone attached to his belt
id feel a whole lot safer with sister loretta for my backup
look at this guy you shredded him
well hes dead he cant hurt me now
the target is rigged they pull the line that dollies it back to shooting position
its sloppy shooting
its in character ruben but unnecessary
and bad for your career
ruben lets off three quick shots they cluster nearer the circle
looks at him in surprise
ive been practicing
now can i kiss your tummy
hides her smile as she prepares her weapon for her turn
perps holding a hostage the shoulder on his gun hand is gonna be exposed
sound a cellular phone on rubens belt
holds her fire
im sure she thinks it is
arent you at least interested in which one it is
shes lost her concentration lowered the gun now as he answers she raises her gun and aims
into phone im here where are you
heeeeyyy what a surprise
on duty have to call you back
you too you too
my god you made my day
he hits the end button
you hit the brachial nerve
the shots make a perfect heart around the circle inside his looser pattern
one final shot strikes exactly youre good enough youll never have to kill anyone
i joined the cops to save lives not waste them
you know m
when i watch you shoot i realize ive got a little problem with my stance
could you just move over here and critique my legs
he slaps his thigh where he indicates the trouble might be
she is unloading her weapon
the problem is between your legs
you told your shrink about that
she is unloading and cleaning up
ruben doing the same
i tell my shrink about you sergeant
i tell him youre the top cop of my dreams
ruben has been gathering up his box of doughnuts from which he has nibbled during the preceding
he drops them picks one up off the floor and sticks it in his mouth
putting away her gear dont take that mess in the car
theyre on the move as they go away from us
hes in love with you already
they pull up in front of an apartment building in the pacific heights section
patrol cars flank the street the thick yellow ticker tape police crime scene do not cross is already up
double parks beside a blue and white
a couple of cars from the media are already there
susan schiffer a bulldog of a woman and her camera crew waylay m
and ruben as they cross the sidewalk
oh christ the mouth is already here
she is with a cameraman with a haircut and smile that speak of a life of orthodontics and dreams of tv anchorship
and theres the haircut right behind
if she stops short hes gonna be there feet up her ass
on camera inspector can you
i just got here myself susan
confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern
do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city
i just got here
talk to you later
as they escape behind the barrier tape what the hell does she want to do scare everybody to death
thats her job
jesus quinn is here already
quinn a splenetic irishman a politician chief of homicide stands at the top of the steps leading to the front door
as they climb up toward him
i been waiting
i have to do everything myself
photo crime tech the coroner are already inside
the landlady calls it in tenant is not answering when called she sticks her head in sees the body uses the deceaseds telephone to call
otherwise nothing disturbed
its all yours kid
ill take care of the mouth and the haircut
and ruben enter
four uniformed cops stand in the hall securing the premises at the back one cop stands by a stunned and tearful woman chain smoking the landlady
to cop that the landlady
to ruben you wanna talk to her ruben
back to cops who was first on the scene
mike answers her question by answering to ruben
forcefully im over here
whats your name officer
you touch anything mike
pick up anything
use the doorknob
i dont want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me
she glances at him at the slightly old inflection on the i didnt
but moves on as ruben goes to the landlady
the same young woman we saw jogging is now dead
hair still in a long braid
she wears only a blouse open and pushed back
she is on her back in the bathtub with one leg dangling over the side of the tub
the effect is slightly posed but casual relaxed
bending over her is doc the coroner withdrawing a huge m
appears in the back of the shot taking in the scene
foreground doc reads the thermometer
the photographer is finishing up his shots
the room is crowded
two coroners men wait in the doorway a stretcher standing on end between them m
has to pass between them to come down to the body
throughout we focus on m
s face her reaction to liver and rigor are telling me about eight hours
im gonna take her out now if its alright
im seeing ligature marks on her neck here petechial hemorrhages in her eyes
you got it
same as the other two
tell whoever she cant come to the phone shes all tied up
thats real old material get a new writer
she picks up the phone after the second ring holding it in tissue someone hands her
extremely cheerful hello
this is geena martinez how are you this morning
what is this about ms martinez
im conducting a telephone survey to determine whether youre satisfied with your insurance on your personal valuables
gently hangs up the phone
she has been looking at the dead woman
they pick up where they left off
he used something soft like a stocking or a bathrobe tie
anybody find it
no answer as the coroners men crowd in beside m
to begin lifting the body out of the tub
takes one last look into the dead womans eyes
cover her up please
ruben still talking to the landlady and taking notes
takes him aside
why dont you tell me whats bothering you
mike is acutely uncomfortable
whatever it is im gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later
well theres something missing in there
there was something around her neck when i came in there but its gone now
who came in after you
she seems relieved
brightly well its all right then mike
in the door m
appears looking out thoughtfully over the scene ruben appears behind her
the photographer is coming out
to photographer get me good faces on the crowd here
get a couple of harness bulls to grab anybody who starts to run
dont tell your grandmother how to suck eggs
i only been doing this work since your junior prom darling
is already on to other things
the door opens and helen looks out wasted from cognac and xanax
she looks for the newspaper and sees it with a look of despair
the newspaper lies there out of reach
as she stretches out her foot toward the paper cant reach it
as she moves out into the hall her agoraphobia manifests itself distorted vision that makes the hall sickening vertigo
the newspaper seems further away
helen she drops to her knees and tries to lean out further into the hall
the floor seems to melt and roll in waves toward her
the newspaper melts like a dali watch
she lies flat on her stomach and crawls toward the newspaper
and with a supreme effort grabs it and squirms back inside
as she slams the door shut on the hall and sits gasping for breath
after a moment she can bring herself to look at the newspaper
insert damn fools
quinn is watching a portable tv screen with profound distrust
onscreen is susan schiffer
continues to stonewall the public
there is a knock but before quinn can respond m
you messed with the scene
he and m
both listen to susan
third bay area woman has been strangled but the police continue to deny that this is the work of one killer
thomas quinn declares that the murders will be treated as unrelated crimes unless new evidence
you messed with the evidence
i tagged the goddamned stocking
it aint lost
were sequestering that evidence
thats the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into
am i in charge of this thing
i said you were
then i decided what evidence we choose to sequester
a beat here okay
what do you want to sequester
the stocking around the neck
a long moment of looking at each other
you didnt say serial killer and i didnt say serial killer
not satisfied she really means it this is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a festival of love
the mayor and chamber of commerce dont want tv announcing killers on the loose
and she starts to go
were gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the grateful dead
sleeping in the park smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass
this large room is very busy many officers at work
known sexual offenders have been rounded up
false confessors add to the crowd
detectives who are not dealing with these people are making and taking calls
at this desk a tall intense looking detective niccoletti interrogates a false confessor a man who looks like a businessman
harvey i dont want you in here no more making false statements
they are not false
we pay for city government like this you dont even care about the truth
i killed her in the bathtub
because she was dirty a dirty girl
how did you do it harvey
with a knife
good guess but not good enough
get the fuck outta here
he has stood as m
passes coming from quinns office
he falls into stride with her through the crowded scene
he is sweaty and sniffs his armpits as a matter of general hygiene checkup
what am i wasting my time with this shit for
because its your job thats all
not what i meant why me cutting maybe its something you did in this life nikko
it has the flavor of a spoiled intimacy an unfinished argument
he pantomimes she got him with a poison dart
that really hurt
ruben joins them nikko stifles and turns away
to ruben get mercer to run the medical dental legal bills laundry and dry cleaning receipts extermin ators mailmen grocery and drugstore deliveries handymen plumbers
its mostly done they got nobody in common the three of them
no mutual friends the landlady says nobody was ever there she never saw her with anybody
they are approaching pachulskis desk
pachulski is on phone
pachulski is looking at m
into phone yes maam i know
you cant talk her right now
because shes busy shes all tied up
sotto to m
deep throats back
he hits the speaker phone
this is the third one
youve got a serial killer here
when are you going to start warning people
whispering fourteen calls from this broad
and she aint stupid
signals for gigi to trace the call
takes the phone switches off the speaker
who is this
helen on phone who is this
inspector halloran homicide
im in charge here
amused ask her about the moon bike
im really interested in your ideas
the moon bike
what is that
what is wrong with you people
the first two i thought he might be on a lunar cycle because they were days apart but obviously not
this new one is only two weeks
pachulski is delighted at the joke hes played on m
not so much
gigi signals theyre getting it
helen contd you want to joke about moonbikes
this is no joke
and neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help
youre calling me a crank
do you have any evidence to report maam
do you know any of the victims
i think this is number three
over her thats an opinion not evidence
gigi hands her a slip of paper
glares at pachulski who is still laughing
knows the name on the slip of paper
covers the phone helen hudson
get ruben back here
as she turns back to the phone
helen now wearing slippers and shorts with the same t shirts she slept in is standing behind the living room curtains looking down at the street
she hears a code knock then a key turns in the lock
she moves to greet andy her assistant and friend
andy is laden down with groceries and mail
helen immediately reaches a hand up to touch his face
where were you
dont tell me
its just under seventy right
the sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh
would you please get your hands off my face tallulah
what happened to the newspaper
he withdraws a popsicle from the bag offers it to her
when she rejects it he takes it for himself
i got it myself
i couldnt wait
arent we the daring one
whats morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make doctor helen set foot outside her door
the antenna is gone off her car again
i had no music all the way to the market
let me find a garage for it
theyre in the kitchen area andy unpacking stuff
ive told you i cant afford to garage it
are you kidding
you buy enough gourmet junk every week
most of which rots to garage a fleet of stretch limos
i had the dream again
beat and i got another call
this time he spoke
he said you and me you and me
a little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for
he whispered but it was him know it was him
andy now stops to address this seriously
he cant phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you
did you give him an approval
when a three year old says theres a monster under the bed you dont say forget it
you look under the bad
beat im three years old
call the prison
her fear is so palpable she is so nakedly vulnerable it breaks his heart
he puts his arms around her
im really crazy
when was the last time you washed your hair
shaky but trying monsieur andy disapproves of my coiffure
monsieur andy can smell your coiffure
and guess what else
he pats her thighs
she walks to the window as he talks
what do you say i blindfold you and take you to the gym
aerobics with housewives
andy has heard this tone before panic attack alert
here we go again
in a parked car a man is reading a newspaper that hides his face
behind him is parked a slightly beat up red saab
you parked right behind him
the one i noticed earlier
i didnt say anything i thought hed leave
just take a look
oh my god
hes reading a but earlier he was staring up here
dirty harry coming up
andy leaves the apartment
the heavy old industrial door is pushed slightly open andy peers out sees andy crosses behind the car and then sneaks back coming up to drivers side window surprising the
excuse me but would you mind explaining why youre watching the lady upstairs
none of your fucking business
usurping rubens aggressive attitude andy leans his face close to rubens window
listen asshole ive got a gun
ruben grabs andy by the collar and yanks his head inside the car
with the other hand he pulls his gun and pushes it up andys nose
i hate this
ruben pushes the up button on the window capturing andys head in a deadlock
then he opens the door gets out slams door forcing the squawking andy into a helpless frisk position
we hear helen scream o
ignoring this ruben begins to frisk andy
helen at window shouting
im calling the police
andy enters followed by ruben and m
who holds up her badge to helen
investigators halloran and goetz
i apologize for goetz hes a firehouse dog
trying to defuse im okay
i really kind of enjoyed it
uncomfortable silence for a beat as they try to take in whats happening whos who and whats what
helen is confused fighting back fear
trying to communicate here ring the gong he goes
poor impulse control
is he out
to andy if hes not out why are they here
because of your phone calls
i havent made any calls
to distract are you staying long
shall i shut the door
make your coffee
make the beds
to helen you talked to me
do you remember
the two women measure each other helen struggling to control herself
you were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank
oh god i am to andy make them some coffee
halloran is it
i had a crank call myself he said
a moment of real fear i thought it might be daryll lee cullum
i thought he might be out of prison
daryll lee cullum
i dont think so
if hes escaped wed have the national guard copsd be crawling through sewers
youd have a guard on your front door
looking around i want to tell you its a great honor to meet you and talk to you
you dont admire me
no police admire me
i got one of you killed
why dont you say right out what youre here for
you called us doctor hudson
yes i did
poor impulse control
the accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man but you kept announcing they were unrelated
youll never catch him that way
regards her for a moment
to andy sugar and cream for goetz i take mine black
beat youre absolutely correct
the politicians dont want panic headlines spoiling the festival of love
well lets thank god you and inspector goetz are on the case then
would you want to work with us on this
oh my god no
im a clinical hysteric with panic syndrome and anxiety neurosis agoraphobic im afraid of everything real and imaginary
i never leave this apartment now
nobody ever comes here
i just wanted to get your attention
i write and i used to lecture on these crimes but
im not competent
i think you are
i really admire everything youve done it would be an honor to work with you and we need all the help we can get especially yours
inspector halloran that is so much bullshit you dont like or admire me but the beautiful part is i dont give a fuck
thats the upside of having a breakdown
well its a hell of an apartment you got here
im living one step away from the projects myself but i get to go to work every day wading in blood and guts
i guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good
will you go
andy make them go
you cant go out lecturing
women are dying
where can i lay this stuff out
she dumps files of photos etc
out on helens cocktail table
i dont want this
what are they
you called us doctor if you dont want to look at them here how about downtown
ill drive you down
she pushes the pictures off onto the floor tries to get up to leave the room
and ruben are both appalled at the force of what is happening an all out panic attack
andy races t o the kitchen ruben tries to help but helen fights him off viciously gasping for air
andy races back in with a plastic bag he pulls over helens head and face
she hyperventilates into the bag
the plastic bag balloons out and back in helens face until she faints
andy deals with it like an everyday event treating her very gently
to ruben now look what you did
what did i do
you threatened to drive her downtown
she has agoraphobia
fear of what
she hasnt been out of this apartment in three years
i didnt used to think it was real
hes making her comfortable
well get the paramedics
oh god uniforms more stress
let her sleep
its a self limiting she hyperventilates till she passes out then her breathing goes back to normal and she wakes up singing like a lark
rocking the unconscious helen we know dont we princess
to them give her a couple of hours
i know about this
starts to gather up the pictures and files
she is angry and disgusted
tell her were sorry we bothered her
leave those here
if you really want her help
i mean if you really do leave them
let her see them
ill see theyre safe
takes in the scene the now soundly sleeping helen andy sitting over her protectively the files and photos strewn around
makes a decision
tell her to ask for me
shes handing andy her card
and ruben come out in the street
camera in a high snotty neurotic bitch
amused classy madonna
she likes you rube
she likes the way you move
she sure as hell isnt in love with me
you came in there with this attitude
over him order chinese for us and meet me the library
anything but beef
she jumps in her car still steaming leaving ruben to move to his car
as he moves camera follows becoming a wider we can see andy sitting where we left him holding helen in putting down the phone
it was your feeling after careful evaluation that he was a sexual sadist who satisfied at least four out of ten criteria in the dms iii
and ruben watching videotapes and eating chinese takeout
helen is being interrogated by the attorney for daryll lee cullum
helen sure of herself to the point of arrogance which is her undoing
he only scored percent four out of ten criteria
couldnt another expert say he flunked the sexual sadist test
what curve are you marking on doctor
the test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects
what did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because joan of arc told him to do it
he was lying
he was lying
i asked you what you thought not what he did
i thought he was lying
you said first he was lying
how do you know that doctor
because people who are suffering from aural hallucinations hear voices in both ears
daryll lee told me that joan of arc always appeared beside him on his left side and spoke softly in his left ear
murmur of subdued laughter in court
emboldened he took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong
he was not acting on mad impulse
he was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time
playing causal what pattern was that
the same as the first time
she catches herself
has leapt to his feet but now tries to sit down as though nothing was happening but helen the attorney and the d
all are clearly disturbed by the line this questioning is taking
the first what
as she hesitates your honor shes got this far i think she should finish
i dont think this jury should be left wondering where the rest of her statement would lead
i agree doctor
the first two murders
what first two murders
we dont know about them here do we
giving up he told me he had done two others just like it
when was that
when he was seventeen
and you believed him when he told you he had done that
i believed him
is rushing to the bench to argue with the judge
yes ill accept a call for a mistrial
evidence of that other crime when the defendant was a juvenile is inadmissible and never should have been heard by this jury
now we see m
and ruben looking at helen on the tv screen there was no sperm
the same as the firs two
definitely a serial
seeing helen on video what are you looking at that for
work the clues
im going to work helen hudson
would you step outside sergeant
leaves a cautiously silent ruben
once the door shuts he turns tape back to play
im telling you
dont you ever address me publicly in that tone
youll work what and who i tell you to work
anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case
shes the expert
i need help
how about i put nikko on it
thats always your privilege sir
quinn snorts starts on his way then turns back
you ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of womens lib
i have reflected on that sir
which explains my gushing deference to you sir
quinn is somehow cheered by this little exchange
nikkos looking better by the minute inspector
he stomps off
helen on couch andy is massaging her neck
i must have looked horrible
youre at your best with a bag in front of your face
i want to die
hell be back
if you want him
the cute brutal type with handcuffs
helen grins and andy starts to tickle her she laughs
you thought he was cute too didnt you
helen now laughing a little too hard
suddenly the laughter changes to tears
whatd i do
reminded me that i used to be attractive
that men used to want me
you slut no sexy young cop for you unless you shampoo your hair
she clings desperately to him
he rocks her as he would a small child
when are you going to call them
big beat about what
andy produces the file m
left with him
helen looks at it
andy watches her
i cant andy
then why dont you just die
theyll find your body years later the old recluse lady she ate cat food ten years of the new york times unread piled on top of the unread mail the
tv still on
make up your mind
live or die
beat ill get coffee
after a moment fighting her fears helen reaches for the file
she opens it and looks at the first picture
the phone rings
panic hangs in the air
andy answers the phone in the kitchen
inspector halloran shes going through the material now
beat shell call you
no shell be alright ill sleep over on the couch in case
but now i told you singing like a lark
after a moment helen bends to her work
scanning microfilm newspaper magazine clips
slew police bodyguard in attack on expert witness m
hears nikko entering looks up gives him a half smile returns her attention to the microfilm
no response youre a damn fool
preoccupied oh i know
youre almost ten years older than he is
turns off the microfilm
the last headline is retained on screen its none of my business anymore
you got that right nikko its none of your business
youre shitting ion your career
you outrank hi
looks at him at last with wry amusement hes jealous of ruben
well you outranked me nikko
and you used that
used me dont put yourself down like that
never used you
i worked my way up like a marine grunt
yeah you did that too
you earned what you got dont shit on it thats all im saying
maddeningly god youre cute when youre mad
the door opens and ruben enters instantly takes in the scene m
sitting in front of a stalled machine nikko looming over her
after an awkward beat nikko heads for the door
ignoring ruben he barks at m
think about it
ruben regards m
who busies herself examining the other tapes
whats wrong with him
hes just mad he let me keep the espresso machine
we heard from doctor hudson
lemme make the call
honest to god ruben
i like women like that
tell it to your shrink
red headed woman wearing shorts and an open necked shirt kneels on the grass weeding a lush flowerbed
the camera swishhpans to the back door of the house as a man comes out balancing a tray with drinks
the woman gives the man a dazzling smile removes her gardening glove and takes a glass
her husband bends down gives her a little kiss
close up early crime scene photos
the way hes posed the bodies
hes flaunting his power to do whatever he wants to her
he probably seems perfectly normal
these murders are organized and planned
in her office laying out the pictures
helen picks out one picture from the rest
except for this one
you put that one in to test me
nods pleased with helen insert the picture
the victims body is covered with bruises
but unlike the others her face has been covered
is it an ongoing case
nods for months
it was a lover or a husband
somebody who knew her and cared about her
glancing at ruben how do you know that
he felt remorse
he covered her
helen arranges and rearranges photos like tarot cards
the bodies have been carefully arranged
different positions but somehow the same
the positions are brutal
hes proud of his accomplishments
there are early picassos and late picassos but you always recognize the hand
he wants us to recognize his hand
ive seen this hand before
what are you hiding
taken aback nothing
where are the stockings he strangled them with
how did you know they were stockings
sarcastic i sent andy out on murder missions
for gods sake its the boston strangler alber desalvo
he used their own stockings to strangle them
tied in a bow knot
she gets down a file from her bookcase and flops it open to pictures of desalvos victims they are identical
somebody is imitating his m
look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman thats how desalvo got in the door and caught them off guard
the boston strangler when was that
in the sixties
hes dead stabbed to death in prison
why imitate a dead serial killer
if you knew why you might know where to look for him
i dont envy you this hes not done hes going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush
now ive done what you asked me
work with me
its good for you
they are startled by his appearance
a little unsettling
its good medicine
a little homeopathic cure for the willies
exhausted none of you know anything about it
and andy if you persist in playing doctor leave with them
im the only friend youve got darling and i dont intend to stop doing what i think is good for us
all of you
andy helps m
and ruben scoop up the files
you said you dont give a fuck and thats the beauty of a breakdown
this doesnt look like not giving a fuck you know that
lets get out of here
as they leave andy is still at the door
small voice andy

the mouth gets a load of this and we got major headlines around the world
the matter you think they dont teach latin in catholic schools
dont swear at me because we got problems
im just giving you the news
i went to a catholic school ill tell you what they teach
on the knuckles they teach
whove i got to beat up except the messenger

im checking out anybody who lives like desalvo
records of arrests for rape especially by a man wearing green
checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile
cross check ing names from arrests for sexual offenses public fondling
if theyve got a german wife
we can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years and this guys going to hit again soon
morose i know
get out here
do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information
or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat
what i love the big fight some girl she drops the quarter on her boyfriend so the bastard spends the night in custody just to teach him a lesson
well get a shitload of those
another country heard from
were keeping it quiet dont give the bastard the attention hes maybe begging for
helen sits at side by side computers
the chess game is again in progress
helen makes a move
pleased with herself she smiles types im creaming you
suddenly over helens shoulder the other screen becomes active we see message for helen hudson
engrossed in her own chess game she does not notice the screen until tense from sitting too long with waiting for chessmasters move helen begins to stretch her neck and
toll her head
now out of the corner of her eye she sees the other screen
quickly she clicks on this and the screen prints out a game for dr
hudson please run this through a collage of images of two women
a hand emerges from a breast of the other
one properly on its own neck the other emerging from between two legs
hands feet breasts hair of two bodies mixed mischievously into one final image of a second woman alive and smiling ecstatically at the camera
both women wear their hair in long braids
has earphones to muffle the tv sound
from the dark spaces of the loft there echoes a scream of sheer terror from helen
after a beat from he realizes tears off the earphones and bolts into the darkness
police cars draw up in front double parking
and ruben jump out and walk fast toward the building
shot from same high angle the secret watchers pov from which we saw m
and ruben leave after their first visit
as her door is opened by andy
ruben and m
shes in the office
the computer glow the unfinished chess game still up and the red headed womans joyful face on the other
helen sits forth suppressing her fear by sheer will
and ruben enter with andy
they look at the face on the computer screen
this is the only light in the room
thats the face of the next one hell kill
she hasnt looked at them or the computer
how do you know that
cant look at it look at the bottom of the screen
you see the icon with the arrow pointing left
click on that
ruben from a misspent youth in video arcades expertly maneuvers the mouse and clicks on the icon as instructed
how did you do that
that computers wired into hes hacked into her internet address
hes a hacker
rocking rocking he can get into my computer any time he likes
this is exactly the kind of thing i didnt want to have happen
can you make a copy we can show on our computers
its too big a file to copy to a disk
you got a tape backup yeah here lemme copy it on tape
why would he send this to helen hudson
its a game they like to play
berkowitz son of sam hung around the crime scene talking to the cops
this ones probably watching you laughing at you
let me get a little action started here
nods to him to get along
he calls on his cellular phone while simultaneously working the computer
im going to put a guard on your door
one officer already got killed trying to protect me
please just take it all away
leave me alone
look at this
as they watch it is replaced by and then it fades to black
helen goes to the machine and maneuvers with mouse and keyboard
the files not here
to ruben what did you do
i just started it copying to tape but the tape never ran
it just did that
respect hes brilliant
this one is brilliant
well show that to
he wrote a self destruct virus into the code so it would only play until we try to copy it
then it erased itself
beat do you remember what you saw
for a moment we wont know who quinn is talking about
hes on the phone calling me like an insurance salesman soliciting my business for christs sake
i didnt tell him the three most over rated things in life are young pussy regular exercise and the oh maaaaan
i talk like a cop this is the way i talk
i cant believe this guy
hes a deputy assistant director of the f
let me help you
we could use a little help
with the f
theres no such thing as a little help
they bury you with help
explain to me about this virus no dont tell me about the virus
thing is you saw it the pictures
they pass through a door into a room where the homicide team sit waiting
goes right into a briefing
we saw it
the unknown target is kneeling shes gardening
red hair high cheekbones mid thirties height i dont know shes not overweight shes zofting
shes in front of a house that looks like
as she is speaking her description becomes v
as we see police cars and an ambulance drawn up in front of the house the marina area there was earthquake damage repair on the house it looked like a
the light was late afternoon
say about cocktail hour
he was bringing out drinks margaritas by the look
so we got a house facing west on the east side of the street
full sun so theres no high trees or buildings residential both sides
susan schiffer and her crew arrive leaping out of their van with their equipment a makeup woman adjusting susans m
and ruben quinn etc
trying to calm and or question the husband who is in shock
he is the man we saw bringing drinks
stupid goddam s stupid p poker game
always have to s stay until phil makes a c
am i stuttering
the husbands voice follows quinn and others as another cop leads them toward the back of house
door to bedroom
quinn and ruben have stopped just inside door
forced to peer around them
s pov on the bed the red headed womans body is propped up against the headboard her knees up her head fallen onto a shoulder her pajama top has been
ripped open and pushed up
knotted around her neck is a pink scarf tied in a huge bow under her chin
on her feet secured between her toes is a commercial flyer advertising the festival of love
it is brightly printed with red hearts
it has been hand lettered camcorder capturing the audience of a rock concert in full blast in golden gate park
the audience mostly young some in s costume sit and loll around on blankets
most seem to have some variety of refreshment
liquid or rolled
the camera records the unsteady progress of a lovely young girl weaving her way through the blankets and the bodies
she suddenly becomes aware of the camera being aimed at her
she stops strikes a comically seductive pose and gives a big gorgeous smile
andy answers the door
she just got to sleep
do you have to tell her about it now
tell her about what mock admiration gaahhd
what a cop you busted me
real the new one in the marina
to their reaction she has a police radio scanner
its always on
she turns it off and then she has to turn it on again
she cant not listen to it but she cant listen to it so she makes me listen to it
i am not going to look at any more pictures
theyre like a disease
they get into my head
i cant get them out
i dont look at pictures
i look at the real thing i dont feel infected
maybe thats why you cant catch him
i know what she looks like the red headed woman in my computer
i just came from her
heres what you havent seen
takes out a picture of the dead red headed woman
her manner is that of cop with a witness
contd a forgery of the mary sullivan murder scene hes done it perfect
except for the sign
looking at photo she probably let him in the door without a thought
where are their mothers
where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight
look at the sign
in the festival of love
you make any sense in that
helen stares at the picture
contd for hell read helen
hes talking to you
its anybody connected to author ity
they write they even knock on your door
theyre fans it thrills them to flirt with getting caught
nobody knows you have anything to do with this case nothing has been on tv or the news
why would he want to get in your computer
because im his damned pin up girl
his all of them
they know me
theyre in prisons with libraries they collect clippings im their worthy opponent
you keep my name out of this
andy who has ducked out now reappears dressed for a date
the moon is up my night to howl
will you be okay
oh god i forget
poor thing you ought to get out
look out for her
shes tougher than you think
i know halloran
whats the rest of it
we call her m
you think that logic and police procedure order and science and method will hold back the horrors of a world gone mad and the sickness of the night
i did once
but you know how hell get caught
hell have an accident or some cop will get lucky
you cant catch him by being intelligent and working hard
or the worst there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way month after month
the news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows and hurry home before dark
and then one day there are no more
did he just stop
get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more
did he kill himself
did he die in an auto accident
or a fight
or get sick and die
its like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth
and you never know
but you keep asking yourself when you read about a new murder is he back
she has noted rubens reaction to helens story
there is an edge of sarcasm in her voice
a whole new book thought up in a minute
beat all i know how t do is get up take a shower and go to work
hope if he does another ill nail the son of bitch and theyll spell my name right in the newspaper
where is andy going
hes going home
he slept over because i was a little anxious
i want a guard on you
im worried about leaving you alone
were through for the night arent we
you go on
get some sleep
ill stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a cab home
that would be much appreciated
to helen somewhere down the line were doing to find a connection between him and you
i want you to worry that idea like a loose tooth
three voices chime self conscious good nights
the silent watchers pov through the eye of the camcorder we catch m
exit helens building
she stops momentarily on the sidewalk to look up at helens window
the drapes swing open
ruben can be seen doing something at the windows
the camcorder zooms to a close up of m
she gets into her car and speeds off
ruben is checking the windows
you ought to get some decent locks on these
a six year old could get in here
much less a motivated man
at the phrase motivated man helen looks at him boldly in the eye
you and maryjane arent lovers
so does ruben
her boldness her laughter attracts him
his honesty attracts helen
he feels the heat
are you always so bold
im shy and im selective
his grin says hed select her anytime
the problem for me is
youre in the witness category
beat jack nicholson know what i mean
another time then
beat ill be all right
hes not going to attack me what i m rally afraid of is all in my own head ruben
they smile ruefully at one another and without further conversation leave the bedroom
ruben is outside the door
helen just inside
theyll have a guard here tomorrow
i know you have the idea but itll make me feel a lot better
she smiles and ruben turns walks away
she stays in the doorway watching his retreat
about ten feet away he suddenly stops
he turns around she is still in the doorway
he reaches for his wallet withdraws a card holds it up to her
the number for my cellular
anytime night or day
i mean that
he hods card out to her
helen holding onto the door frame doesnt move
ruben continues to extend his hand with the card in it
it is a charged moment
she is frozen in the doorway ruben refuses to make a move towards her
helen summons all her nerve and lets go of the door frame determined not to have any further mortification this night she takes one shaky step out into the hallway
to meet him
then a second step and a third
her hand touches the card takes it
she turns her head to gauge the distance she must retreat
what she sees is that the doors sureclose device has quietly and efficiently closed
the door is locked
frantic she turns back toward ruben
ruben now seems a vast distance away from her
he is just turning down the stairs and is gone
the hallway first narrows squeezing her in then expands
she is lost in the miles and miles of space between the two walls
ruben reappears races toward her
tell me what to do
im going to fall
she starts to pass out to sink to her knees but ruben catches her puts her up against the wall handling her like a suspect
he puts one hand on the back of her neck spreads her legs gets her in frisk position
somehow this is comforting to her but she is still in full blown panic
he pressed his body up against hers his weight anchoring her against the feeling of free fall
im right here
i wont let you fall
he still has a hand on the back of her neck
suddenly the proximity effects him makes him want to kiss her neck
she begins to hyperventilate
dont let go
i cant breathe
ill fix it
ruben takes out his gun
put your hands over your ears
ruben shoots off the lock
then he picks helen up and carries her back into her apartment
ruben enters and puts helen down on the couch pulls a throw up over her
he sees her xanax bottle on a table hands it to her
she takes out three as he pours her some seltzer water then watches her take the pills
after which he takes the bottle and pockets it
ill get a locksmith
will you stay
im afraid to sleep
i dont want
him in my head
ruben pulls a big chair up beside the sofa
as her eyes close ruben comforts her
tv features the antics of a nervous little prairie dog family
he looks back at helen
we hear a faint but impatient voice call peter
the room is unattractive over furnished but not comfortably
a woman is sitting propped up in a double bed
she is in her mid thirties but drained and pale she looks older
a chronic invalid
by her side is a nasty little dog with ribbon bows in its fur
near the bed is a tv and video on which a movies final credits are running
younger than the woman rather good looking
boyish and nondescript except for a patch of white skin near his hairline
an old scar
he goes straight to tv and puts the tape on eject
put in the kevin costner
why dont we save it for later
its almost time for letterman
you know i dont like to watch talk shows by myself
he inserts the video she wants and pushes play
then he approaches the bed leans over his wife and gently pushes a lock of hair back from the forehead
she ignores him staring at the screen
the nasty little see now youve annoyed her
you know she doesnt like you to touch me
to dog does she widdle wee fing
wuhve you so much
to peter did you feed her
yes i fed her
if she says shes hungry shes lying to you
she doesnt lie
you sure you fed her
she lies all the time
why would i say i fed her if i didnt
thats what i dont know
why would you lie
thats the problem
i cant understand why anyone would lie
as he goes we can hear the woman still talking to her dog over the tv soundtrack
woman contd you wouldnt lie to mummy would you
just to get dad in trouble
such a naughty widdle dog
her voice fades away as we follow him down the stairs into a small ill lit and dreary living room into a messy kitchen then through a door leading to
he locks the basement door behind him
the basement is brightly lighted full of high tech gadgets and computers
as he approaches the bottom stair we see a small tv video set attached to a wall
on its screen freeze framed and silent is a video of a pretty girl at an outdoor rock concert smiling seductively
peter puts on a white lab coat and then reaches over something to turn the video back on
the camera pans down to what he has leaned across
it is the young girl from the concert
she is strapped onto a table her mouth taped shut
a plastic bag covers her head but not tightly
she is semiconscious
she is being asphyxiated by slow degrees
peter looks at her gently pushes the bag up far enough to repeat the tender gesture with her damp hair that he made toward his wife
he whispers didnt i promise id come right back
all night festival revellers dance across the skyline of glorious misty green hills hand in hand
the camera moves down across verdant meadows until we arrive at the bottom of the nearest hill which slopes finally to a highway
a few festival up all night revelers looking down at a new crime scene where three blue and whites are parked plus a number of unmarked cars
as he moves past the ever present susan we thread through the scene to find m
takes one look at rubens stubble his yesterdays slept in clothes and she turns away
before ruben can catch up with her nikko approaches
up all night with a sick friend
nikkos face is tight with anger
you dumb son of a bitch
you dont even know how to treat a woman
hey nikko explain to me why she gave you the boot
he moves to m
who stands beside the dead body of the woman we last saw strapped to a table
the plastic bag is now tied tight around her neck
she has been posed beneath a sign that says no dumping
the usual technicians photographers doc the coroner etc
is niccoletti assigned here
angry about it quinn decided we should form a task force theyre all one case now
he wants all the senior detectives on it
to doc she wasnt killed here
is kneeling inspecting everything here ruben kneels beside her
tell me what you see
he inspects the dead girls fingernails
she didnt fight back no hair or skin under her fingernails
im not seeing any bruises or contusions
what about her arms
needle marks fresh here
look at this
nikko appears looming over her
probably so stoned she never knew what got her
like goetzs sick friend
they ignore him
shes blue as hell
no marks on her neck
not the same no ligature marks
look at her legs
spread out like she was sexually assaulted here
after she was dead
she was dragged up here from the road you can see the tracks
she was already dead or unconscious
lets get plaster casts on any all footprints
if this is just the dump site where did he do the job
where did he pick her up
doped up kids all over town
park was full of them last night
very easy pickin
ruben hits him nikko reflexively throws a punch that grazes ruben
everybody stops in astonishment
steps between them
ready to get physical herself they settle
what the hell are you doing
the mouth and the haircut are right down there thank god they didnt see that
down below susan and the haircut are interviewing festival of lovers
niccoletti theyre on the wrong side of the tape you want to push them back
nikko trots off to susan and the haircut
gestures for ruben now on his feet and dabbing at a split lip to follow her back to the cars
as they move more slowly down the hillside to their cars
ruben my god i ought to put you on report
i cant stand that bastard
getting back to work this is something new
not the same guy thats for sure
yeah everythings different
but she seems unhappy
to techs standing by get the pictures and casts of footprints
look at him grandstanding
nikko is talking to susan schiff
thats all we need
she strides toward them
whats this about the boston strangler m
looks at nikko
he should know better
shes also thinking is this a good thing to have the media announce at this point or not
hey susan im sorry youre on the wrong side of the tape
were still trying to find any footprints or tire marks and we dont want to chew up the ground okay
ill talk to you later
to nikko you too
shes got susan outside the tape
inspector will you confirm somebody is copying the boston strangler
this is the fourth is that correct
were going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement
she is getting into her car ruben jumps in on the other side
susan races for her silver audi
ruben put the light on
from outside the car as they drive away we see rubens arm clap the magnetic flasher on the top of their unmarked car
switches it on
a chase ensues
susan has a faster car but m
is a better driver
stomach dropping hills trolley cars the corkscrew turns of lombard street all the familiar san francisco chase scenes
now listen up ruben
you never never never mess with somebody inside the case
excuse me what do you
you damn well better start working on that impulse control
a woman who is implicated in this case
someone whos practically a piece of evidence its against your rules that i try to help a witness whos scared shitless
the womans unstable
you could wind up with a harassment charge
anything youre like some horny little teenager
takes another two wheel corner
in the rear view mirror m
watches susan lose control of her car as she tries to make a tight turn m
smiles in contempt
anybody whos ever watched tv knows about that corner
having lost susan m
slows down to a normal speed
everybody could see you unshaved same clothes from yesterday reeking of sex
rubens eye brows lift
she peels into the hq parking lot and jumps out
going away park the car
call the lab
get doc to lean on the coroner for a really fast prelim on the sperm
ruben gets out of the car to cross to the drivers side
when you get it call me
ruben look after her a smile of delight on his face
she loves me
i know the kid hit you first
he already told me
hes not treating her right
she left you nikko
shes not your responsibility
she takes very good care of herself
if she wants to romance the kid it aint your business
your business is to snap out of it
we were together six years sir
dont give me six years
you never divorced patty did you
so whatd you expect from m
she knows im catholic
she never mentioned divorce
then you shoulda known she wasnt buying
she was just long term leasing you
beat ah nickie
except for that rare twenty second twitch there aint nothin about sex i dont hate
but of course im irish
beat plus i got real problems
im worried i might have to put you in over m
theres something going on here the commissioner is targeting her now i cant leave a woman in that position
but the thing is how can i move you in if you go on acting like a teenage asshole
i dont want the job
dont do that to her
shes worked too damned hard for it
whats going down with the sting in chinatown
that gonna be off your plate in a week or what
bulletin boards with notices and pictures telephone techs are still installing phones cops are learning unfamiliar computer menus etc
is examining huge sergeant
she walks away beckons beckons come on walk after me
he walks out of a door and they stand on the steps
a couple of cops maybe male and female are smoking there
quinn gives them a look that sends them scuttling inside flipping their butts into the shrubbery
quinn sighs and digs out a cigarette
the looks between them tell the story of his trying to give it up and not being able to etc
so what have we got
its not the same guy
it should be a self solver
no bow around the neck left and body outdoors completely different
the others were housewives secretaries he talked his way inside killed them in their own living room or bed or bathroom
this one didnt have a husband or a boyfriend no family temp waitress arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses dui asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head
the others werent molested that way
were waiting for the sperm tests
how old are you
you sure you want to be in this line of work
youre damn right i do
okay now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective
what the hell is going on
you got no discipline in your operation
im sorry it had to come to your attention
i am dealing with it
she starts to go
where you going
what the hell you need her for
because i think im wrong
im not seeing anybody
we hear muffled voices andy and m
helen as she realizes andy is letting m
in goes to the bathroom door and tries to slam and lock it andy beats her to it blocking with his foot in the door
do come and meet your guest
taking in helens condition due to a wild night with ruben
helen moves from the bathroom down the hall to her office as
weve got another one
thats no surprise
but its a different m
then what do you need me for
she was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot
where it says no dumping
her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose
its all different but it seems so the same
artificial and posed somethings wrong with it
youre saying its the same man but hes changed his style
that doesnt happen
these men are robotic the murder is like a ritual
the method itself is part of the pleasure
theyve turned into the office
something is wrong
who turned off the internet computer
i turned it off
its like an open window he can climb right in
he comes in the window we maybe grab him
wheres the on switch
have you got a warrant
get the hell out o here
this is the only space i have left in the world why cant you leave me out of it
helen the killer directly contacted you
his interest in you is intense im worried about you
i dont want to lose you
i know this stirs up every monster under the bed but this is the only direct contact we have with him
the only chance we have to trap him
beat so you can turn internet back on or i do and we put somebody here on a hour shift and you can kick scream and hyperventilate
that little winona ryder manner
youre more convincing as clint eastwood
clint is putting a guard on you
but if you swear to leave the computer on winona will assign him to the hall outside
helen has to laugh
the laugh turns to a hacking cough
shes smoking again
helen sits and with the care of someone handling a rattlesnake turns the computer on
a beat yes shes right here
helen hangs the phone to m
the air is a little more charged
helen goes back to the computer
listens nods so thats that
please thank inspector goetz for taking care of me last night
delivers the message straight faced
hudson wants me to thank you for taking care of her last night
hangs up lab report on the new one
at least two guys penetrated her
there were two kinds of sperm
the poor thing
what it must have been like
helen has come alert
she was near a sign that said no dumping
two kinds of sperm the lab said one was a secretor and the other was not
mumbles a surprised yes
helen is at computer
there were needle marks
but no drugs in her blood
so far nothing they test for comes up positive
helen has a window type screen she clicks icons
is that it
stunned thats exactly
i could have taken that same picture this morning
hes switched from desalvo to the hillside strangler
the strangler was two men thats why there are two kinds of sperm
his idea of a joke very witty our boy
thats not consistent
you said they never changed their style theyre robots
consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds
tell them to test for the chemicals found in windex
thats a product for cleaning with
i know windex for gods sake i clean my own windows
its what bianchi and buono injected into one of their victims
sensing something appalling injected windex
why would he switch to a new m
ah if you knew that youd be half way to nailing him
serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive
this guy has a plan all thought out flexible and complex
hes playing a game with us
who will he imitate next
maybe hes doing all the serial killers in history the great innovators the murderers hall of fame
just to prove hes better than all of them
they got caught he didnt
hell get caught
if he has a plan thatll be what trips him up
whos going to catch him
beat and if you do therell be another one
and one after that
gently surprised youre afraid of him
this one yes
i was always curious about these twisted little souls but this is the first one ive felt personally terrified of
hes something new and unheard of
i dont know what he wants
beat im giving you clint outside
the room is empty the messy unmade bed has covers thrown back
nasty little dog is sprawled asleep on it
the tv is on susan schiffers broadcast
over susans shoulder big and bold the legend to mimic the m
of the boston strangler
the police here are rumored to be consulting dr
a toilet flushes and peters wife emerges wearing a nightgown
she shuffles back to the bed and as she sits picks up the remote
it was backstage at the mcclusky auditorium on the berkeley campus that dr
hudsons police bodyguard was killed
daryll lee cullum that
she zaps the remote and a program hyping the summer of love comes on
we see on his computer screen a picture of helen scanned from some newspaper or magazine
peter is building a morph beside helen on screen is another image of the red headed woman
he is placing marks on one picture on the exact corner of helens left eyes
as he does so a red dot appears near the corner of the left eye of the red headed woman
both pictures are dappled with similar dots
it looks very odd as though someone had stuck post its all over the images
around him as he works are other pictures asphyxiated girl taken while she was strapped to the table
of the sign no dumping
he also has convicted serial killer had escaped police custody during a court hearing in a scandal that rocked the police and forced the resignation of four state correction officers
daryll lee lies smoking and watching a tiny tv of his own
cullum attacked doctor hudson in apparent revenge for her testimony against him
doctor hudson did not return our phone calls today
our sources tell us that if police homicide detectives fail to move faster in their investigation the fbi will be called
striding tight lipped through the room to her workstation where she takes the phone from ruben

helen her police scanner sounding distant tinny cries in the night helen holding the phone digesting that
carol meany call your home

go to channel
code red homicide at th avenue and horgan woman dead in car
can we have homicide
all units go to channel
leave channel clear for homicide
a man parks a car
he gets out
he is dressed entirely in black
glancing around to be sure he is not observed the man moves to cars banging them hard with his hand until he sets off a car alarm
he trots silently to helens side of the street and merges into the dark side of her building
the alarm goes infuriatingly on
a light comes on in an upstairs window
burt the cop on guard marginally irritated by the car alarm looks up briefly then returns to his magazine
her features a bleak white on black
and ruben work the scene along with the crime tech crew
one of the tech guys holds up a bullet
pulled this out of the door its bigger than a
is crawling along the floor looking at everything she can find gum wrappers hobby pins loose change etc
she lifts her head and finds the car radio and tape player right in her face
was this on
when you found the car was the tape player on or off
it was on auto reverse over and over
has rubber gloves on
she switches on ignition and the tape player starts abba
a phone rings
on ruben standing beside the car he answers his phone
i cant talk now
theres no sexual assault its a drive by a woman in a car its not him
mouths to m
still pissed at the earlier phone call turns away dismissively
its a woman shot in a car
i have to go
she on the passenger side
shouting to be heard helen hang up let ruben get on with his work
whats that music
i can hear it
bunch of swedish women
youre too young
dread clouds helens face
she is calling up databases screens scrolling across her computer monitor
dont hang up
what listen to me
is there a gas station nearby
ruben look around sees a gas station across the street and further down the block
is there a phone booth there
they all have one
go and look for a note
ruben hands the phone over to m
she wants me to check the phone booth for a note
excuse me we
she was listening to abba in her parked car when she was shot with a bulldog
reacts the scene of what helen is saying hits her hard
this is repeating the pattern of yet another killer
the techie who pulled the bullet out of the door turns
let me see the slug outta the door
he pulls a baggie out his pocket and hands it to her
ruben running across to the gas station
hes alone now the blazing lights of the crime scene recede
a small annoyed crowd has gathered around the are whose alarm is still shrieking
burt finally gets up goes to window sees situation decides to go and fix it
still on phone to helen
shes just got the bullet out of the baggie tony stands watching
whats that siren
one of those goddamned car alarms
rubens gone to look
its banged up but it looks like a
its son of sam
is it son of sam
look in the crowd
he liked to hang around and watch the cops at work
ruben at the phone booth
a note lies on the shelf handwritten in felt tip pen
he puts on a rubber glove picks note up by one corner
ruben has taken phone back from m
he is reading the note to helen
agitated stands by
police let me haunt you with these words ill be back
notices that there is writing on the other side of the note
she forces rubens gloved hand to turn note over
hold on a minute helen
by this time m
has seen that this part is addressed to m
takes phone from ruben forcing herself to sound casual
helen rubens going to drop by
hes got some questions
she hangs up ruben is already on his way
calls a number
the beeper on burts belt is beeping but his head is under the hood of the car where the car alarm is blaring
he cant hear the beeper
ends the call yells to another detective
i need a unit at lorenda drive
tell them to approach code and wait for instruction
find the goddamn officer supposed to be on security
rubens on his way
hell go in alone
the horn blares across the street o
no one notices the man at helens door swiftly fiddling the lock with a ring full of burglars keys and picks
helen is putting on makeup ruben is coming
a small but alarming noise at the front of the loft
she listens carefully and moves to the door looking down the hall toward the front door
it is open burt is not there
she hesitates a moment then turns off the lights and sprints for the front door to escape
ruben taking the hills fast
rubens car screeches to a stop
ruben charges into the building
burt coming awake follows ruben up the stairs three at a time
balaclava off his face
he is a middle aged afro asian with a knife scarred face
i can explain
the fuck you can
are you okay
then he sees her
in shock she stares down at the man
did this animal touch you
she shakes her head turns and runs out of the room as ruben catches sight of burt
turn on a light and call in the unit
burt rushes to okay
ruben frisks the man
bullshits gonna get your balls stomped on
whats your name
the improbability of this name makes ruben deliver an angry kick to the mans side
swear to god
conrad chow never carry a gun
to burt then you get your ass outta here i dont wanta see you again
i brought a present for the lady there
im looking for her to give her the present
you break into her apartment to deliver a gift
where is it
the door was open swear to god im just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs
where is it
im trying to tell you
its on the ladys pillow
ruben shoves conrad into backup cops hands
ruben comes running in sees a parcel lying on pillow
scoops it up and rips it open
its a book
he returns to conrad who is now surrounded by police
ruben holds the book up like a question
daryll lee cullum he wrote that book he wanted the lady to have it
they wont let him send it to her so im getting out he asks me to deliver it in person he says put it on her pillow
it has all about how he tried to kill her
he told you she was loaded any thing you could steal you could keep conrad
you bought yourself a return ticket to quentin breaking and entering
the door was already open
to a cop send the book to evidence
shes supposed to have it
she dont want it
helen is sitting on the floor her knees pulled up to her chest
open the door
the guys nothing
she sits there says nothing
open the door
why dont you shoot off the lock
she starts to laugh
the sound is awful
after a moment she gets up on wobbly legs and opens the door
ruben takes her to the sink sort of sits her down on it
wets a washcloth goes to sponge off her face
she is trembling
he was in my apartment
i know baby
without warning in some sort of manic phase of a freak out she breaks away from him ricochets through bedroom down the hallway ruben follows tries to put his arms
youre safe with me
he pulls her down into a chair with him his arms tight around her holding her still
he smoothes her hair rubs her neck pets her like a frightened and resistant cat
when i was a little kid and id be in a state my father would hold me on his lap until all the fight would go out of me
she breaks free and whacks him across his nose
you think youre my daddy
there is something so perverse about this so erotic that ruben kisses her
she goes limp kisses him back then shes suddenly sobbing
his nose is bleeding but shes smiling
something between them has finally connected
been agreed upon
honey you know i gotta go
he digs out his sneaky gun from whenever he keeps it
you know how to use this
they taught me at the fbi
i was very good at it
it scared me
i liked it
you take it hang on to it itll make you feel safer
once that youve decided on a killing first you make a stone of your heart and if you find that your hands are still willing you can turn murder into
the fbi arrives
high angle looking down three identical cars draw in front park with military precision all four doors on the all three cars open at the same time and identically dressed
men in suits get out slam the doors in sync
and march toward the front steps to hq ignoring a couple of bemused cops smoking on the sidewalk
as the parade of fbi led by their commander saks walk down the corridor from the front door toward camera performing a smart right angle turn and camera panning to
follow continue away from camera down another corridor
through the glass partitions and in the halls they pass cops who pretend they arent looking at them no eye contact between cops and fbi
the cops are at ease bellies slop over belts neatly pressed blouses strain over breasts sweat stains shirtsleeves
the marching men wouldnt sweat
quinn emerges from his office and sees them arriving
he gets his jacket off a hook on the back of the door signals a few top officers to follow
he looks resigned
ruben nikko and a number of other officers are being addressed by saks an fbi agent
at the back are three more fbi agents suited and tied
quinn stands off to one side
projector beams up a copy of the note ruben found in the phone booth
hudson dont lose your head
once that youve decided on a killing first you make a stone of your heart and if you find that your hands are still willing you can turn murder into
well if you have a taste for this experience youre flushed with your very first success then you must try a twosome or a threesome before your conscience bothers you
then you can join the ranks of the illustrious in historys great dark hall of fame all of our greatest killers were industrious at least the ones that we all
know by name
i am research title meryhew saks
the song is called murder by numbers
the performers are a group called the police
from behavioral science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note
this is an extremely complex case and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around
were not ruling out the possib ility of three copycat serial killers
we have quantico working on graphology the washington lap is cloning dna from the secretor
its our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims
we have a team sweeping sperm banks
now i want to say a few word to you local people
your commissioner asked for our assistance
the bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police
we couldnt catch up on what you people know if we had a year
we have nation wide resources and hard state of the art forensic science you have the local savvy
together we can be unbeatable
which one is inspector halloran
saks approaches m
guides her away from the others
two shot saks is unctuous and insincere self confident
we dont see too many lady homicide detectives
you have my respect
have you discussed the note with dr
someone broke into her place last night
it wasnt connected to our case but it shook her up pretty bad so i havent
quinn joins them saks gives him a nod
i was just about to advise the inspector here not to show dr
hudson the note
sir doctor hudson and i see a pattern develop
riding over her we know helen
shes not exactly a credible collaborator
especially late in the day
she takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes
who prescribes the brandy
s look makes saks smile
quinn is called to the phone
how come youre so up on dr
she is a writer writing best selling books about serial killing
giving lectures shes well paid for
her interests are not the interests of law enforcement
weve put a tap on dr
i know you wont mention it
so much for any trusting relationship right
quinn has arrived addresses saks
sorry to interrupt
i need a word with my officer
he turns to m
diplomatically saks moves away
im going to have to borrow ruben
the alien smuggling thing in chinatown is going down tomorrow night and jacks kid got hit by a car
i gotta give ruben to nikko
what does this mean
now we got the fbi my team is expendable
im working my ass off is anybody listening
why ruben anyway
he and nikko dont even get on together
teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self discipline
if this is a first step in kicking me off the case just tell me to my face sir dont waste time being diplomatic
just i need results
and i am short handed
who else am i gonna give him
looking at saks give him that pompous son of a bitch
she turns and leaves brushing past saks as she goes
gigi meets her
they got a result on the drug test you requested
it takes a moment to remember what it was
they said it was windex
if there was any residual doubt about whats happening its gone now
she starts after quinn sees he is in spirited dialogue with saks and decides to wait
helen and m
helen unfolds a xerox copy of the note that m
has just given her
ill be back
as she looks at the back of the note
she looks up into m
addressed to you
dont lose your head
helen puts down the note
she is holding herself together by main will power
doesnt want to face that note
they put merry saks on it
he said to send you his regards and to tell you that the bureau holds you in the highest esteem
what i cant believe is that in an earlier life i slept with him
any god that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button
looks at m
just give me a minute here
the letter is addressed to me
shes breathing fast controls it you dont feel fear do you
you feel like youll live forever
i put my ass on the line giving you that
they werent going to show it to me
its my life its also the major piece of evidence and it makes you a key part of his plan
you cant run away from it anymore
beat look at the order hes doing them
he did three as the boston strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work
then he did one like the hillside strang ler
and then one as son of sam
to lead us on to where and what end
and hes doing more than that hes imitating each killers method as closely as he can in details
its not chronological son of sam was before hillside
she begins to read
its clear he thinks he knows me
he lives a fantasy
helen dont lose your head
is that a threat
does he want to cut off my head
dahmer cut off heads
i think rivkind did
she puts the note down on the table smoothes it out
she closes her eyes for a moment
we begin to see certain filtered images
as they come we intercut them
he attacks what he feels he cant have
what he feels excluded from
lush pastoral green
we see peter sitting by himself
he wears a white lab coat like one we saw hanging in his basement
his pov of students on the green playing frisbee studying together picnicking
women sunbathe their straps pulled down on their shoulders their tops rolled up to expose their midriffs
first you make a stone of your heart
he doesnt suffer
now its our turn
one of the sunbathing girls sits up and looks round then takes her top off entirely
kemper said in order to have the experience he wanted with them he needed to evict them from their bodies
by making the body a completely passive object he releases himself from passivity
but the relief he feels is only temporary
before your conscience bothers you much less
but the tension always comes back
she now picks out the words you can join the ranks of the illustrious
he wants to be like them the best
to become the best
but he has his own desires his own compulsions apart from theirs
his own horrors
an incremental flash of a small boy standing by his bed which he has wet
his pajamas are soaked
his powerful mother grabs him by the hair and drags him with her
some horrors that are all his own
the small boy is flung into an under stairs closet where firewood and stacked papers are kept
the door is slammed hard
he gropes around in the darkness finds a big box of matches lights one
then angrily he sets fire to a pile of newspapers
they start to burn
we see but do not hear his screams for help
he needs to prove they dont control him that hes the one in control
but the feeling of power never lasts
he can control his victims but he cant control anything else
his place in the world
he want s to be recognized
he puts messages in my computer he sends me a letter
she picks out the lines
then you must try a twosome or a threesome
of course he wants to do a threesome
only bundy did three in one day
is bundy next
but bundy should be last
the grand finale
what about kemper and ramirez
gacy dahmer williams
who else is on his list
in what order
peter in his car
ahead he see two girls at a bus stop
we see peter take a long bladed knife and carefully conceal it under his right thigh
the two girls are wearing backpacks
festival of love stickers decorate the bags
peter pulls his nondescript sedan up to them and says something
they giggle shake their heads
he laughs holds up his hands to level of his shoulders in a not guilty gesture then makes a peace sign
the girls giggle again but do not get in
peter drives off
great dark hall of fame
all our greatest killers
his greatest heroes he wants to be famous
when theyre caught and people like me write about them we give them a kind of immortality
they get thousands of letters
ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month
theyre like film stars
they get fan letters
we keep records of any threatening or illegal correspondence like relatives of victims who might want to send the condemned man some strychnine cookies
so its only a partial list but youre still looking at about forty pages
would you fax those pages to me
on the phone
on the desk in front of her is a list of killers complementary to helens
thank you for your help warden hillyer
as soon as you can
she hangs up as gigi puts a long fax sheet of names on m
hot off the fax
doesnt look at the rivkind list just crosses his name off the killer list and picks up the phone dials waits
if we keep going and work till midnight
ive got a date
youve got a date right here andy
this has got to
we now see andy is feeding the scanner he has a thick sheaf of faxed lists
its almost six
and guess what
hall likes me bathed and shaved
stop acting like a silly little fag
his eyebrows arch but his smile stays in place
my life to live darling try to remember what it was like way way back when you were young and sexy and alive he gets up and walks toward the
the door slams o
helen angrily hits the keys the dirty bastard
is entering at front door let in by a new guard fred
its not a real name its the name of a mass murderer in germany in the s
they called him the monster of dusseldorf
is turning into the office she carries a portfolio of lists of her own
lets speed up the game plan
call all the living serials to ask if theyve had contact with a peter kurten
we could use some help on the phones
theyre not talking to me
saks looks right through me
i ask him for some bodies for the phones hes so encouraging you make that your little job
careful helen on your lists to call is san quentin
daryll lee cullum
beat you do that one i dont want it
sergeant halloran is it
ive got a list of daryll lees correspondents
there is a peter kurten among them
daryll lee claims he has information about kurten but hell only talk to dr
the creeps been studying his amendments
my guess is he doesnt have zip
just angling for a chance to ask if her bra size is still the same
we get this shit all the time but its her call
determined shell talk to him
they are waiting helen tense smoking atmosphere charged
do those things really help
like she really wished they might so she could have one
helen looks at her cigarette as though shed never seen one before
grinds it out
not a damn bit
and unconsciously lights another during following
gestures encouragement fist in victory gesture
daryll lee cullum is on the phone a warden is attendance but not on the phone line
on this rare contact with the outside world he is manic
how you doing
she turns on speakerphone
hello daryll lee

helen how is life you okay
come see me talk to me
i think about you worry about you all the time
i am so glad jesus didnt let me kill you
you know youre blessed by jesus
thats why you need to come talk to me because jesus kept you alive for a reason and i was his sacred instrument
in the moment satan was in my heart raising my hand to kill you jesus took my hand to spare you
i am both death and life to you
helen hangs up
has already left
pandemonium the chinatown raid has been carried off and nikko and ruben and a dozen other cops are booking a group of chinese gangsters of all ages and a group
of frightened and confused chinese illegal aliens
i brought back a gin seng popper for you
guaranteed all night orgasms
save it for helen
wait a minute wait a goddamn minute
he manhandles the kid into docility while
the woman was in shock
she was totally out on ranks
i stayed because i didnt want her to wake up alone in a place where shed just been under attack
to the kid who is restless stop that you son of a bitch
back to her the place wasnt secure
i was doing my goddamn job
and for the second time i slept in her living room
dont try to lie ruben
you dont have the face for it
i need you to help interrogate the burglar in hudsons place
talk to nikko
nikko sites at his desk processing the papers for the sullen young thug who is handcuffed to a chain next to nikkos desk
nikko unholsters his gun
he shoves it into his desk drawer
you speak english
chinese you need an interpreter
quinn walking past the illegals speaks to gigi
i didnt want the illigals i wanted just the bastards dumping them in the harbor
whats keeping those bums at immigration
nightmare in here
i gotta have ruben and a
outta your mind
look at this
to quinn lieutenant
just at that moment the kid ruben was booking goes totally bananas m
goes to his assistance wrestling this wild kid
nikko starts from his chair looking for the key to the drawer but is isnt there
he goes to help ruben get the kid under control
quinn steps in
the prowler in hudsons apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect
amazed you got a suspect
howd you get in on the deal
im gonna drop charges on the break and enter at hudsons
you have no authority to make a deal like that
that s for the or the f
if he knew you did that
theyre all asking me what is she doing as it is

we get through this shit let em all go
nikko has stood and moved the handcuffed thug toward the door to jail cells
checks her time wall clocks help ill talk to conrad myself
ill be in the jail when you wind this up
i gotta get something to eat i havent eaten all day
ruben cant find a desk to work at and commandeers nikkos
he slams the kid into nikkos chair and cuffs him
kid starts to rattle his chairs spew chinese epithets then bends over the desk and with his teeth picks up some paper tries to shake it to shreds
ruben yanks the papers out of the kids mouth pulls the kids chair from the side to the front of the desk shoves the kid into place facing away from
the desk so that he cant do any more damage
then ruben cant figure out where he can work
at the next desk where he has been working mac rises
to kid im going to the coffee machine
hold the fort
he moves off the kids eyes move calculatingly around the room
he twists against the cuffs trying anything to get free and discovers he can pull out the desk drawer
close up the kids free hand rifling through the drawer behind his back finding the gun
pull back to show the kid
he is as ruben positioned him his back pressed against the desk
conrad is brought in by a guard
who are you
you were supposed to contact a peter kurten
cagey i was
how you spell that
cut the crap
you got a sheet the length of my arm
interrupting i never hurt nobody
shut up im talking
you got felony breaking and entering burglary felonious
interrupting i never carried a gun
she slaps him hard
he is shocked
you dont listen very good
this break in i can call it a felony three strikes and you got about sixteen strikes already and youre in jail for the rest of your life no parole
or i could see it gets forgotten
you get me out first
doesnt work that way
you had your chance now fuck yourself
shes walking to the door
conrad holds out just one more beat to see if shes bluffing
her hand is on the door knob
tell me what you want me to say
you were going to make a delivery to peter kurten for daryll lee cullum
i want kurtens phone number

i told you what you wanted dont forget me
ruben takes coffee and doughnuts out of a box then leans over the kid who seems to have calmed down
he uncuffs him from the chair
you refuse my hospitality im putting you to bed
he pushes the coffee toward the kid who whips nikkos gun out from under the desk where it was hidden and lays it up under rubens ear
kid moves behind ruben and puts a skinny arm around rubens neck pulling him upright
ruben still clutching the doughnut box
it takes a moment for the others to see
then the room is absolutely motionless
take it easy kid
nobodys gonna do anything
just let the gun down so it dont go off
screams nobody comes through the door
behind the kid as he backs through the door across the corridor we look straight down a corridor to where m
is coming almost at a run she sees what is happening
the kid doesnt see her yet as he is backing away from the others
draws her gun and stands in firing position
hey you the kid turns sees her exposing his shoulder to her
she im a juvenile
im a juvenile
the kid has been taken away
paramedics are removing rubens body
stands frozen as rubens stretcher is carried out of the room
her hand holds the doughnut box
blinks her head turns as if she cant imagine what to do where to go
then suddenly conscious of the doughnut box she clutches it tight against her chest
she abruptly remembers the rendezvous with peter kurten
i need a couple units to drag the area
nikko sits numb
if possible nikko is more devastated than m
she speaks to nikko but does not look at him
quinn will be here any minute
what are you going to say
i didnt lock the fucking drawer
you spend twenty years thinking some perps gonna whack you
youll crash your car
but what happens is you fuck yourself
a chocked laugh you cant imagine how many times i saw you two
your head together i wish him dead
want to hear something weird
i feel like id give my life to bring him back
youre in terrible trouble nikko
who gives a fuck
in all the years i never seen you cry
beat you loved him
who gives a fuck
quinn enters to find his two senior officers in tears
pays no attention to conrad
i wanna see you later
nikko stands and he and quinn exit
sits staring into very crowded with a generally young clientele
big dance scene
a number of men wear s costume
an occasional bit of drag
andy and hal dancing
andy with great abandon
hal seems to need a break
he leads a good naturedly protesting andy back to their table
they find a stranger sitting there
on his desk lie a badge and a gun nikkos
is looking at them as nothing her look hes on temp leave with pay
i talked the commissioner out of no pay
pulls her badge out and puts it down in front of quinn
you want mine too
you take his you take mine
im the one fucked it up
so im maybe gonna lose three good cops
you fucked up on this occasion but dont be so hard on yourself
theres something i want you to think about
the book says if you use your gun use it to kill thats what its meant to do
you tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting to keep him alive
to what end
youre not willing to kill you cant be a cop
go get drunk
helen is lying wide awake
the phone rings
her answering if yo dialed carefully youve reached your dream number
now you know what to do
beep from the office
ymca heard in b
helen leaps out of bed and runs down the hall as their compulsion is less about sex than it is about control
release from passivity
albert desalvo bianchi and buono berkowitz dahmer
dahmer killed his first victim because the boy just wanted to go home
bundy said he wanted to master life
she has reached the machine she picks up the phone
andy is wearing a bright and distinctive jacket
a new guard fred is letting m
for the first time helen is glad to see her
walks down toward her
you were right
he knew me
he went to my lectures
he recorded them
listen to this
she is too full of her own shock to wonder why m
is here at this hour and to notice the state m
she has turned back to the answering machine and hits the play button m
standing beside her
she also has the text of the lecture on her computer screen action
release from passivity
albert desalvo bianchi and buono berkowitz dahmer
dahmer killed his first victim because the boy just wanted to go home
bundy said he wanted to master life
helen has turned and now sees m
she stops what happened to you
so stupid a cop thing a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes
because you and he
tears start again just running down no sobs but she cant will them away
she brushes at them angrily
i just thought it was so unprofessional
of you both
he felt sorry for me
it was so nice to flirt
he was a darling man
i thought he was a boy

to avoid any strange male contacts and report any man with an apparent handicap who tries to get them to carry groceries or books or push his car
saks has appeared and stands by quinn they both stare at her and she becomes more and more self conscious and aware of how impossible this is
to them that was bundy

nitrogen fog swirls as a stainless steel tubule is lifted out its bath of liquid nitrogen with a long pair of tongs
camera follows to reveal peter foley in white lab coat
through a glass partition he sees two unmistakable fbi men enter and begin talking to the receptionist in an outside office
he continues about his work
camera stays on the welcome to weekend gridlock on the freeways
everybody heading for the mountains and or the sea sings by the sea by the sea by the beautiful sea and my oh my what a mess

blah blah helen at her computer
which says helen types xxxx xxxx appears on screen
then a message any student name registered in crime psych matched to titles of term papers with any mention of peter kurten
what she types on screen is the text for a boolean search for such items research needed
she waits for a second
you poor sad little bore
i failed you is this what
sound her front door opens
she starts turns
feet moving toward her but quietly cautiously
as the footsteps turn into the hall
she stands reaching for anything to defend herself with a paperknife
she moves to the door raising the knife
a man turns into the office and she launches herself only stopping the stab of the knife at the last split second
she screams again
then smothers him with kisses and hugs
for gods sake stop my head
i have the iraqi mother of all hang overs
very quiet in the hospital zone please
she clings to him
where have you been what happened to your wallet

she taps her chest where she has a bullet proof vest under her shirt
on bullhorn peter foley we are the police

a dozen men pour into the house from front and back converging in the dimly lit living room
smoke obscures everything
the dining room and kitchen are empty
smoke is thinner here
the room lighted only by the glowing tv screen
the wife still in bed shot through the head
others crowd in kicking in closet and bathroom doors
is by the bed just turning to start aback swat man emerges from the bathroom with the body of nasty little dog holding it by the tail she has now
changed into a pair of sweat pants and a t shirt
susan schiffer is on tv with shots of the fire i am here with lieutenant quinn of the homicide division and title saks of the fbi
can you tell us what happened here tonight
during the following we move to peters house where quinn and saks are being interviewed
susan the san francisco police department assisted by the fbi developed evidence that the serial killer referred to as the copycat killer was an individual who resided at this address
upon being asked to step out of the house to be interviewed the suspect set fire to the house possibly to destroy evidence of his wifes murder
we found her dead of gunshot wounds in an upstairs bedroom
he himself died in the fire
to shouted questions no well wait until weve located any relatives who should be notified
witnesses saw the individual burn to death they were unable to reach him in time to save him
were glad as the entire city must be glad this reign of terror is ended
no no more at this time
others quietly entering slipping out coats talking and drinking at some distance
takes off her shoulder holster and gun and puts them down on her workspace
nikko is at little distance cleaning out his desk
he comes down to her as she sits
good police work
just horseshit luck
dont ever forget how good you are
he is standing behind her and leans over to almost touch her hair with his lips
i love you
twists in misery and fury
her phone is ringing on another line she punches it
i dont believe it
beat i saw him die
i saw him burning on the basement stairs he never reached the top
they never kill themselves
how do you know it was him
you never met him
you never even saw a photograph
helen let go

if there are three dead chi omega college girls tomorrow how will you feel

this has been the worst hours of my life
im going home
im going to try to get drunk
if theres a one percent possibil ity can you live with yourself when he kills again
oh shut up and dont be so damn self righteous

she barely misses hitting another car
she drives on until she is forced to stop at a traffic light
all during this youre on the air whos this
ron thats not my right name thats okay ron
what are you afraid of
i dont want anybody to know my name because im a friend of peter foley
i know him from the gay community
he was cruising the night
switches stations channel surfing
bits of music rush limbaugh back to ron droning on
that i resent the tone of the police and their attitude
that this is just some weird queer event just because they couldnt stop this guy until he did himself if you even believe that
turns off the radio
when light turns green instead of moving ahead she just sits for a moment
then furious with helen with everything she swears and wheels the car into a tight illegal u turn
it is extra time which means party time or those whove finished and solitary and group study time for the rest
and there are celebrants of the festival of love who were being born about the time of the original event
tracking it is parked under a tree some distance across a parking lot jammed with student cars
it is partly in shadow so she could easily have missed it
she jumps out of the car and moves fast up the steps through students drinking kissing studying arguing
main meeting room
full of people milling about
music is playing
sees the back of a tall man on crutches talking to laughing
moving fast toward them she runs into a girl spilling the girls drink on her blouse
this is brand new
wherere you going
continues to move the girl grabs her
no you dont spill all over somebody and just walk away you damn well pay the cleaning bill
police business take your heads off
holds up the badge
dont make me pull the gun
she jerks away almost knocking the girl down
the girl is yelling beginning to attract attention
turns back to see
peter and the coed are just moving off the coed holding his books he hobbling on the crutches
runs through the crowd toward him and those who notice are pissed
she is getting close when just as he and the coed would pass from sight behind a wall peter looks around straight at m
swallow the joint
its barney phyfe in drag m
walks out of the room and down the corridor
helen lies wide awake in the dark
thinking its m

beat who was the man in the basement
you like that action
didnt that cop on tv look solemn the guy in the basement doesnt matter anyway just another lonely heart
where are you peter

helen gasps with the implications of that
what was that
what am i hearing
the sound of an epiphany a sudden blinding insight
its daryll lee cullum isnt it
i cant get to you
you have to come to me
you know i cant do that
oh i think you will
peter rips duct tape off m
yelling call the police
peter punches m
who is handculled in her car they are parked in front of the lecture hall

shes not important
you know where
where it began mccluskey auditorium
he hangs up
time zero hundred and twenty two minutes and sixteen seconds june twelve helen hudson court order alpha bravo
it is pulled open metallic sounds of bullets rolling on the wooden drawer her hand bats away the usual bathroom drawer garbage and pull rubens gun out her trembling fingers
helen wearing loose coat jeans and sneakers opens the door
fred snaps out of a sound sleep
its all over fred
they got the guy
you go home to your own bed now
i got to have that from my superior
one guy fired off this job already
use my phone
theyll tell you its all over
the door opens and helen appears in it
she confronts the street and the night
one more threshold to cross
its covered with city grime
the night seems to roar the lights blur and flare
a truck comes past too fast stirring up dust and buffeting her with wind
helen steeling herself and running the few steps to her car
car as she slides into the drivers seat slamming the door and locking it
she drives off into the night
a broad view through shadowy trees shows its lighted facade
parked in front of is m
suddenly from door
he shoves no sign of recognizing her
maam please get out of your vehicle
oh christ of course you had my phone tapped
just get out of your vehicle
hes got sergeant halloran in there
hell kill her the minute he sees or hears your people
youve been very useful doctor we appreciate all youve done and now the professional will take over
he wants me he doesnt care about her
new angle helens saab speeds out of the tree shadowed street into the bright plaza in front of the auditorium and brakes behind m
sudden silence when she kills the car engine
she gets out of the car
as she walks even her sneakers make an echo from the silent stone facade
she walks up the wide stairs
the huge doors creak open and helen enters
she stands listening light streams in from the exterior through tall windows otherwise its all back shadows weird enough without the distorted vision the vertigo that momentarily returns
helen wills herself to move into the deep space before her
she stands listening we hear the creaks and tiny snaps of a building cooling in the night air
or is the movement of peter somewhere in the room
she whirls to face a distance sound that echoes in the auditorium
close helen staring trying to see
let us in there
men begin moving cautiously out of the trees and shadows toward the auditorium
you said youd come die with me
listen to them
well be on all three channels
kill me peter do it now
if thats what all this carnage is about then do it
have enough guts to do it
dont talk to me about courage
i know death what its like to kill
youre not a killer you watched daryll lee kill that cop and you didnt make a peep because you were paralyzed with fear
i know something else about you
peter is jerking about with amphetamine energy he pops a pill into his mouth and swallows
you want one
there was something in you that was fascinated that wanted to see what it was like for a man to die
everybody feels it
like every person who slows to see a bad accident or runs to see a fire
i see it in you
youre the same as me
he leads her back to the stage
he pushes her into a chair facing him
he looks into her face and smiles
well keep talking
until they get here
smiles i have no life anymore
i ruined your life make me pay for it
why did you do that
didnt you have any idea how hard it was for me to get that far
i worshipped you
you inspired me
i thought you could understand me the way you understood the others
i knew that about you the ones you admired were the great murderers they fascinated you
thats not who i admire i admire people who are good at what they do great artists writers thinkers
i dont have the talent for any of those things
all i have a talent for is death
and i am one of a kind
what do you think of your student now
i have made you famous i am your creation and your monument
if you let me i can make you more famous than any of them
i know whats coming now
let me help you
do anything you want to me
i give myself to you
only put the knife down
isnt this what you always wanted
i know its what we all want to love and to loved
i could love you
you could work together in some safe place learn to really understand you help you give you some peace of mind some happiness
back in the drivers seat again doctor
that old dream study us to see what makes us sick
so you can find a cure theyd name it after you
death is the only cure for people like me
he leans toward her with the knife
this might be the moment
his gun lies on the floor beside him
for gods sake now surprised like a child you hurt me
jesus that hurts
you think the rib is busted
that looks like just a bad bruise
ill tape it up if you want to
ill take some tylenol and codeine instead how about a lot of number six
the medic turns to his medicine bag
cops swarm around them
helen sits down next to m
begins to put on her shirt wincing at the movement
helen helps her
it hurts oh god
light and shadow
sees him she takes out her gun and hands it to him
it is what he expects but she misunderstands she is offering it to him as her resignation from the cops
he takes it only as a part of officer related shooting routine
she looks into his face ill take it kid
you take two weeks paid leave
dont waste a second thinking about that shitbag
then come back
youre a cop m
he nods to helen
quinn contd get the civilians outta here
shes in no shape to give her statement tonight
no she can come in tomorrow
gonna want to know a lot of things
the cops have pulled peters body by the feet letting him bumpity bumpity bumpity down the steps from the stage and lifted him onto a gurney
the body is wheeled past them as
the only one who could tell you what you really need to know is dead
yeah its a thought
of no importance to him he turns away
in the lobby area between the auditorium proper and the big exterior doors now the worse for wear from the concussion grenades
outside through the glass we see a media circus under the bright lights put up for the assault
and the cops and technicians are working away at one side is a small door easy escape
they run toward it
it is dark where they step out into the night
around the corner of the building we see the light from the media you could use a long hot bath you know that
you better get somebody to drive you home
why cant i drive home
look at you
you need a ride home
and you dont even know it
beat well thanks
the two women continue down toward helens car just outside the circle of media
camera rises and rises to a high full the mouth and the haircut spot them and race toward them
whats the story here
on the two women getting in the car
if she has to ask shes never gonna know
