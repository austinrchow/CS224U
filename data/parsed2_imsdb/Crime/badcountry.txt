ex cons at a table riffing through buds cash
a curtain yanks back and ray wheeler enters
dope thin bloodshot eyes
he looks at bud
bud looks at him
ray clicks on the tv and opens a beer
tv in evening news
the storm outside alters the reception
and today thirty one year old gary plauche pleaded innocent by reason of insanity to charges of second degree murder in the slaying of accused sex offender jeffrey doucett
bud watches ray empty a gram of coke onto the bar
using a credit card ray starts chopping lines
the sound continues throughout the scene
district court judge frank salia scheduled the trial one year to the day after doucett was first arrested
grace hefts a lock box to the counter removes a drawer of emeralds
bud sees packed carelessly underneath uncut what do you got there
thats thirty grand
out the door
aint got the scratch right now
but i am interested
and the volume of the tv now becomes more apparent
as a result of numerous threats made weeks ago tight security surrounded the courthouse
however missing from todays hearing was the arresting officer
bud has been tuning out the tv distraction
until that last statement
he sneaks a look
from east baton rouge sheriffs office
a wave of static scrambles the picture
when it clears
police lieutenant bud carter
bud is stunned
his own face appears on the screen
a younger photo of bud clean shaven dressed in police uniform
a beat up plumbers van is parked in the distance
tv in signal wavers
its archive footage of baton rouge airport
a prisoner jeffrey doucett escorted by police
doucett was being extradited to baton rouge
ray does a line of coke keeps chopping
watches the tv
grace is bagging emeralds
jake and doug count cash
bud keeps the tv in sight
tv in the procession moves past a row of pay phones
at one phone a discreet figure gary plauche turns
the victims father gary plauche stood waiting at the terminal
as doucett walked by plauche turned raised a handgun
buds vision is suddenly obscured when grace steps forward with the emeralds in a satchel
here you go
fifteen three karat blues
sudden gunshots and screams on the tv
tv in jeffrey doucett lies dead as police wrestle gary plauche to the ground amid chaos
lieutenant carter was unavailable for comment
tight on rays eyes intense watching the footage
as bud stuffs the satchel in his coat we see what ray sees
tv in bud police badge around his neck arresting plauche
on ray slow burn realization as he looks from the tv to bud
eyes lock they both know
motherfucker hes a cop
bud yanks a
and everything happens at once
a sudden gunshot and jake fires again
wood splinters as bud fires back
jake is hit in the throat
a second shot in the forehead he slams against the window cracking it
among surveillance equipment sits buds crew todd shepard david marandino and dale cobb
marandino behind the wheel slams his foot on the gas
a shot zips across buds back he spins off the table
on his knees doug is firing a
blam blam blam blam
bud fires a burst through dougs chest dropping him
a hole explodes beside buds head grace firing a
as ray screams and runs out the door
marandino winds through gears as ray hits the yard running
pov through the windshield marandino swings the wheel hard slams into ray launching him through trash bins into the mud
cobb jumps from the van and pounds ray into handcuffs
simultaneously shepard sprints for the trailer door
grace explodes from the back door bolting across the yard
bud scrambles on the floor of the demolished trailer
held tight he runs out after grace
the chase rages
as he jumps a link fence lands and trips into a roll of chicken wire
his sleeve catches rips as he pulls free
at a searing pace
he slips in the mud
sees grace disappear in the shadows
grace throws himself against the side of a power unit
tries to slow his breath
then turns the corner
graces pov a shovel swings from around the corner wham
the blow sends grace sailing back
he slams on the ground with a blood covered broken face
as he tries to get up
buds gun is there
and like that it stops
at a table the metro squad bud shepard marandino cobb are drinking
a bartender sherry is wiping down glasses
think i broke a knuckle on that guys tooth
he only had one tooth

to the bartender another round sherry
bud blows smoke distant from the others

tomorrow morning we put our friends under the lamp

a dark stone monolith off the highway
bud smokes standing with shepard in semi darkness
theyre looking through a two way mirror into an interrogation room where cobb interviews ray wheeler
i told you
i keep tellin you

thats not it
weve been here all morning
well stay here all night
bud paces to a neighboring interrogation room where marandino is questioning grace bruised face swollen broken nose
the stones you were fencin belonged to an amsec wall safe in kays jewelers
the rest from a vault in bocage
both owners can verify their belongings and have
beat who you fencin for

bud sipping coffee paces back to rays interview
we got a series of burglaries in the area
all over the last six months

bud sets down his coffee calm
marandino sits across from grace clearly frustrated

exploding the door blasts open
bud charges in throws grace against the wall then slams his face onto the table pushing down
i know youre too fuckin dumb to be any more than a courier
i know youre coverin for someone else

bud twists his broken nose
to marandino marandino puts a hand on buds shoulder bud shoves him off
marandino locks it
bud turns graces nose even harder nearly rips it off his face

he aint just woodwork
night passes and the dawn arrives
front door opens and the shadowy figure of jesse wheeler whose face we cannot see emerges
waking bud targets out
jesse fires up his battered green pick up truck
he backs from the driveway and proceeds down the street
into radio alright

buds car starts and we move off with them
into radio were mobile
in the rain bud and shepard tail jesse from a distance
they pass an alley where a waiting buick falls in behind the chevy marandino and cobb are inside
we see the truck slowing angling into a texaco station
hes turnin off
lets take him in the car
into radio waitll hes stopped
watch your backgrounds
jesse stops at a pump
suddenly bud appears at the window and jams a shotgun against jesses head
you motherfuck ill blow your head clean off
reflecting in the side view buds badge swings from his neck
jesses eyes resign to relief
bud sees this
shut the car off slowly
with several law enforcement shotguns now leveled at him from all directions jesse turns off his engine
bud shepard cobb and marandino vests and shotguns move in unison around the house
bud and cobb stay to the shadows down a side yard
shepard marandino reach the front door
a tv plays quietly inside
no one in the windows
shepard signals to marandino
the front door is kicked down
shepard and marandino spill in guns ready
a pregnant woman in the kitchen
lynn wheeler s
she screams curses
hurling dirty dishes fly like frisbees
more dishes lynn suddenly gasps agitatedly sinks to the floor
a gush of fluid soaks through her dress
bud and cobb enter from a back door hurry towards lynn
bud lowers lynn to the floor
to cobb a door slams open to reveal
a nazi iron eagle battle flag
draped across the far wall
windows taped over
walls painted black
military surplus on every shelf and surface
bud in the doorway
shepard joins him
several cops now on scene ransack the house
ripping open cabinets drawers tossing everything to the floor
cobb flips a switch
a lamp illuminates a workbench
alright i want everything seized
cabinets lockers and tool boxes slam open
cops stop cold blown away by what they see guns

shepard leans over a mounted a
he finds a string and very slowly pulls up a ziploc bag filled with diamonds
theres some weight
bud takes a seat at the table
for the first time we get a good look at jesse wheeler cold eyes
covered in tats
with a boilermakers build he looks what he is
im detective lieutenant bud carter of the east baton rouge parish precinct

bud examines a vials label cyanide

bud right with him grins
impurities from what

bud looks in jesses eyes and believes it
shepard searching the room
then leans down to peer under the bed
stops stunned when he sees a row of live goex charges in packing boldly marked explosives top of his lungs mike braddock s captain of detectives enters his office
bud tows carrying files

braddock smiles slightly

braddock thinks then ill bounce it up to the d

two guards escort jesse
hes bound in chains orange scrubs
end of the hall
a black prisoner waits arms slung over the crossbars with a cigarette
jesse is brought forth
a guard unlocks the cell
the black prisoner steps back joining two others all black looming in the darkness
jesse steps in
guards unlock his shackles
chains hit the floor
behind him the bars slam home

any yall dont like it step your black ass forward line up
cued by jesses challenge each of the prisoners slowly rise vehemently approaching
and the phone rings
buds house is sparsely furnished

bud lies in bed wide awake
the phone conversation carries over
you could say this is where he peaked
coffee pours into a mug
then a shot of irish whiskey
hes a white supremacist
the worst kind if there is one
bud dressed now
the table is covered with various reports and photos from jesses file
buds eyes guide us through
came in on armed robbery and assault
bud picks up a photo jesses angola mug shot age
but word in the system said hes a contract killer for the aryan brotherhood
photos of jesses tattoos sun wheel on the shoulder hell hounds around the biceps thors elapid covering his back
in here the guy became an organizer
buds face goes in and out of light and shadow
controlling hits and movements inside the system
prison to prison
state to state
bud is walking with murphy captain of the guards
between the aryan brotherhood and neo nazis he unified the front
bud and murphy descend steps to a grim corridor
all them prison gangs in the world
black panthers mexican mafia forget it
the ab is deadly as it gets
and jesse wheeler was their ring leader
the phone conversation fades out
presently so what the fuck happened
processing aint open till morning
we threw him in holding last night
fore we even turn around its like were back in the fuckin alamo
he attack the guards
guards are fine
but he took on three niggers like they stole from him
murphy stops outside a solid steel door
ill tell you somethin bud
after it happened our block was the quietest itd ever been
wish we had ten just like him
open the door
murphy shuts the door and a series of locks bolt
were in a stone closet
no bed or sink
heard you refused a public defender
jesses bruised face moves through shadow
at the gas station
when you were arrested i put a gun to your head
you expected someone else
you dont look like cops
and your house
mass supply tells me intent to sell
cyanide in the fridge explosives
tells me youre scared
jesses eyes emerge from the dark
bud looking right at him
i know who you are
if you knew that much you wouldnt be in here alone
bud smiles and walks to the door
one more thing pal
i saw the judge this morning
grins there is no bond
hold on jesse
bud bangs on the door
the door opens and bud steps calmly out to the hall
the door shuts with a boom locking jesse in
and the nail in the coffin resonates
dim and desolate
grace buys a ticket crosses the lobby to the mens room
grace at the sink
he pats running water on his damaged face and straightens the bandage
the stall door opens and a man emerges
lean and fierce like an electric charge
grace freezes at the sight of catfish tightening his belt
lets the water run
hey there catfish
catfish steps close reaches a hand to graces face
the hell happened
catfish pauses then sniffs his hand
catfish steps to the sink
begins washing his hands
so where you off to
goin to visit my mother
shes real sick
thats too bad
so youll be gone a long time then
another man suddenly enters
large and imposing neck tattoos swallows hard buzz
catfish turns off the water
the bathroom is suffocated with what can i do yall for
how come the wheeler brothers is locked up
and you aint
wheeler brothers is locked up
i dont know nothin about that
i heard different
well there aint no different to hear catfish
cause i aint talked to neither of em
but you did talk to someone
grace turns to look
in a blink catfishs gun comes up one quick pop
with a thick barrel silencer
the mirror shatters
graces knees hit the floor
his head hits the sink holds
as blood runs from one small hole
catfish straightens up in the next mirror
tucks his shirt
graces body sags to the floor
catfish and buzz walk out
two guards and march jesse down the tier
on his left prisoners in cells turn stare and whisper
jesse arrives at a cell
calls out open ninety six
bars slide back
jesse walks in
his cell mate steps cautiously from the shadows
pale and nervous
jesse stands over him
the brothers eyes connect
and theres a moment
high stone walls topped with concertina wire
looming guard towers
thick fog blankets the yard filled with convicts
jesse takes hold of a metal bar lifts it from a bench press
he does two reps
the weights bang down and jesse sits up
this place is bad
ray adds weight to the already excessive amount
he sweats as he talks nervously over jesses shoulder
theres eyes everywhere
like i got a sign on my back jesse they all think i talked
jesse scans numerous white cons watching the wheeler brothers
just the other day
some spic fish got hit with a weight
ten other cons they beat him and stabbed him till there werent nothin left
and the guards let it happen
ray fastens the safety collars and jesse leans back
his brains were on the wall jesse
like somebody painted em
jesse does another set
weights bang down
he slowly sits up
they come at you
but its in the mail
i can feel it fuckin coming
ray shoots a look at a group of aryan brothers across the yard
czapp their leader and roach
czapp looks at him
jesse leans back
the press shakes as jesse does a last set
his red strained face as the bar lands with a crash
a long line of prisoners are filing back through the gate
ray behind jesse
says low hey jesse
silence sorry i put you back here
i never meant turns sorry raymond
you aint sorry
pause i took you into my home
i tried to clean you up
and you steal from me
you take my fuckin diamonds
dead to rights cause of you i missed the birth of my son
ray swallows hard
nothing he can say
close on numerous files of aryan gang members
arrest sheets paperwork and photos
alright lets work this
beat in prison wheeler is credited for the expansion of the brotherhood
when federal split up members they had to reorganize
so they tattooed their blood types and serial numbers on one another
recede and multiply
reveal now bud and shepard with cobb and marandino around a table used as a converted eating area
put em in prison they get stronger
everywhere you send one they recruit in numbers
within five years their numbers were over ten thousand
wheeler directed all that huh
shepard is flipping through a worn thick file
what do you got there shep
interpol wired us files on three known aryan leaders in the state of louisiana edgar bingham
and this man
he opens the file revealing mugshots of lucian adams
sharp gun metal features
high priest of the aryan national party
his ministry of christian identity and paramilitary order has stood for over a decade
check this out
shepard pulls an old faded surveillance photo long shot lucian talking to a young jesse outside a compound
wheeler was just seventeen when he met lucian at the patriotic congress
today lucians one hell of an entrepreneur
owns surplus stores
a piping business
got trucks runnin all across the god damn country
buds been quiet says now stay focused

if wheeler ever flipped news would spread like wildfire

to the group look this guys been in it a long time
hes up to his elbows wants to shake his hands free
i can feel it
braddock aint gonna go for this
ill handle that
everyone looks to bud
we got one chance here
cause if this falls short
jesse wheelers worth more dead than alive
a sea of tables divided by race as far as the eye can see
jesse and ray trays in hand find an island of aryan prisoners
they quickly part to make room for jesse to sit
suddenly czapp and roach arrive with their trays and abruptly sit across from the wheeler brothers
how you doin ray

to jesse listen to me you sonofabitch

your reputation is smoke
whatever they say you is or once was i dont give a flyin fuck
cause its my say so now
and your fuckin brothers up for grabs
czapp looks away from jesse and shouts down the table yall got that
suddenly jesse springs
a headbutt explodes czapps nose and throws him back
czapps head hits linoleum echoing with a crack
he lies still
bloodied and unconscious
stumbles away shocked fuck
jesse calmly resumes eating
czapps blood covers his face
suddenly an alarm blares
guards pour in led by murphy
inmates hit the deck arms behind their heads
all except jesse who continues to eat
stand the fuck up
hands behind your head
hands behind your head
get on the fuckin floor
jesse puts his hands behind his head but does not kneel
restraints are slammed on jesses wrists
the door unlocks and drags open
jesse turns blinking painfully into the light
sees an imposing duty guard
jesse is led in
duty guard hits an extension button on a desk phone and offers the receiver
jesse doesnt move
its a secure line
duty guard walks out
alone now jesse picks up the line
into phone yeah
a low whiskey voice is heard over the line lucian adams
been a long time
jesse shuts his eyes
theres a moment before he opens them
read about the arrest jesse
theres a lot of heat on this one
i dont want my brother touched
laughs faintly i aint callin about your brother
im callin about you
jesse turns slow to find the duty guard watching him from the hall
lights a cigarette stares
you should have come to me sooner jesse
none of this would have happened
im askin you lucian
my brother aint a problem
your brothers a fuck up
and jesses quiet
we may know what you can do
but you know what we can do
jesse hesitates then lucian hangs up
room strewn with piles of casework
bud agitated paces
braddock behind a desk
youre reachin bud
the leverage aint there
its gotta cook a little longer thats all
jesse wont so much as blink at doin life
the fuckin guy didnt rise in the ranks cause he skirts under pressure
beat theres no deal to be had
cmon mike you know whats goin on
ray wheeler compromised jesse
by that he compromised the brotherhood
dont tell me there aint no fuckin leverage
bud pours himself a cup of coffee
we need somethin more
well we aint sleepin till we find it
lynn dark pouches under her eyes goes through security check
infant son in her arms
wives girlfriends and lawyers talk to prisoners
lynn dark pouches under her eyes holding their son across from jesse
you know how fuckin long that is jesse
lynns hands are shaking
so what am i supposed to do
upset your friends are comin by the house
askin questions hangin around
waitin for the god damn phone to ring
jesse is silent
you said we were done with this
that they were out of our lives
the baby begins to cry
we have no money jesse
which means we have no fucking food
say something would you
its gonna be okay
im afraid for my life
the baby wailing now
quietly crying for our baby
tight on jesse for the first time appearing powerless
as lynn wipes tears trembling in her seat jesse looks away from his son and glances up
behind a glass partition outlying the room a man is watching them
fixing jesse with a hard stare
a clerk passes lynn her belongings through chain link
she wipes her eyes holding the baby
the back bay doors open
sleepless wrinkled clothes
we havent been properly introduced
im detective bud carter
i know who you are
you have a ride home
we took the bus
bud peels a few bills from a fold puts it on the counter
take a cab
bud lays his card atop the bills looks at lynn
you need anything
anything at all
be sure to call me
they look at each other
she pulls her baby close
theres an unspoken moment
and bud walks away
lynn waits till bud is out of view
then takes the money
and the card
a guard buzzes jesse through
prisoners line the tier
jesse walks past enters
where ray sleeps in shadow on the bottom bunk
jesse pulls a polaroid from his pocket his infant son
he gazes at the photo for a beat then brings it to ray
jesse nudges his brothers shoulder
raymond take a look
jesse rolls him over
ray is limp
a filthy syringe imbedded his arm
eyes wide and vacant
jesse lowers pulling ray to his arms
he shuts his eyes
and as jesse feels the bile rising his massive frame begins to shake
then we realize hes crying
rays corpse is loaded onto an ambulance
jesse sits in shadow
and its still
hand under the pillow
when theres a sound
his eyes snap open to discover the silhouettes of six men rushing into his cell
a loaded sock swings out from jesses pillow slams man in the jaw with a crack
on his feet jesse whips the sock around and whacks man s head against the concrete wall
he slumps down unconscious
a blunt object is rammed into jesses sternum
another shot bangs his neck
the sock drops and a padlock clatters out
with a final burst of energy jesse turns screams and rushes man
man slams into the cell bars
the remaining three men attack
a series of blows rain down and jesse sinks into their grip
more guards pour in led by murphy
they yank jesse from his cell and take him down the tier
guards toss the cell in a thorough search
prisoners move to their bars shouting and jeering as jesse is wrestled down the stairs to
jesse thrashes violently as the guards slam him through a door into
between cell blocks
the roar of prisoners recedes as jesses dragged into darkness getting darker
theres a flash of light
were in a windowless room
and bud pouring coffee for two
want a cup of coffee
jesse is handcuffed to the table
guards are breathing hard
this how you do things
when i want to talk to someone without giving the impression hes cooperatin
jesse pauses caught by buds tactics
the guards file out and shut the door
jesses eyes are fierce and watching buds every movement as he hands him a coffee then takes a seat
you got a problem
yeah whats that
to start with youre lookin at two hundred years
ive done the time
ill do it again
i know you can do it

and you never see your kid
cept in here

jesse silent a dark internal pause
he meets buds eyes across the table then
do you hate
jesses sudden directness has caught bud off guard
who do you hate the most
blacks you throw in prison
i dislike what they represent in the system
not as a whole
and jesse begins to consciously or unconsciously preach
and you believe that by overthrowin aryan nationalism and integratin races
polluted creeds with us
you believe youre solvin somethin
i believe we survive by integrating safety
understanding hate and how to stop it
it aint evil to fight it
its evil to tolerate it
leans in maybe you forget that to justify what you do for a living
are we still in prison or we back at the compound havin mass
you dont get it
no dont dictate to me what put you in here or question my intentions with your overcooked revolution

and the longer youre in here theyre up for grabs
the wheels turning

and thats where it hangs
jesse rises wearing a suit

kiersey shakes jesses hand
reveal bud seated in back watching the proceedings
lynn asleep in bed
jesse stands holding his son quietly comforting him
when jesse turns we see a
tucked in his back
static he listens then into phone okay
jesse steps through his fence into deep woods to find a car waiting idyll on a dirt road
a heavy set man at the wheel
jesse gets in as the headlights spin on and the car pulls away
eerie and desolate
the car arrives
jesse steps out and disappears into the shadows of a towering crane
on the jetty a nondescript man stands alone against the calm mississippi
his back is to us
jesse approaches stands quietly beside him
hows your family
we realize now
lets get somethin straight
i aint here cause im scared
i done what i did cause certain people crossed the line
they didnt keep their word
well my word counts
they stand together facing the liquid horizon
i want a body jesse
how many you want
bud finally looks at jesse
a swamp area used as a mud retrieval source for the levy
fog obscures nearly everything
jesse slowly emerges
then bud and metro on all sides mag lights flak jackets and shotguns
a duffel bag of shovels
the sounds of the swamp are terrifying
herons and bobcats
boots hitting water
the buzz of a million mosquitos
suddenly a rushing sound an alligator shoves off the mire
the fuck is that
cobbs light catches the tail whipping into the swamp
wheres this motherfucker taking us
jesse suddenly stops
bud and metro stare
directly to bud dig here
metro exchanges looks anxious
bud nods okay
metro engulfed in fog
picks and shovels rise and fall
we hit something
bud excitedly descends the pit to scrape gravel from metal
clear it off
come on find the edges
jesse watches as a pair of steel drums emerge
the cold room
bud and braddock watch as two pathologists hose down the drums
the stench is horrible
how long they been down there
jesse tells me six months
bud theyre biodegraded by now
fuckin worm food
well get an id
remember we got the guy who put em there
blow torches roar as pathologists burn through the drums
the lids crash
swamp water floods out
and immersed within two sore covered decomposing bodies
the room recoils from the fumes
lynn is putting dishes away
the baby nearby sleeps quietly in a swing
lynn gazes out the window
jesse is under the hood of his truck fixing the engine
when a mustang white on white roars up the street
jesse glances over as the car pulls alongside the driveway
its catfish at the wheel
a wolfish grin
bout time to get a new truck there jesse
jesse tightens a nut with a torque wrench says nothing

as catfish drives away
we hear a series of photos being taken at high speed

pull back to a distant construction trailer
bud with a long lens camera triggers snapshots
greasy spoon soul food joint
trucker and labor patrons
bud walks in perplexed to find braddock sitting with martin fitch deputy chief of staff for us attorney general

fitchs smile drops as bud stares him down

we dont want to miss a big target hitting a smaller target you understand
well exposing bodies has limitations
those people are dead

jesse stares at nokes
as the meeting settles back to a comfortable level
im a little pissed im number two on that list

the room erupts with laughter
everyone except bud and jesse
jesses truck moves over an old wooden bridge through sweeping fields that stretch to a vast wooded area
jesse stops at a long drive protected by locked iron gates
a surveillance camera zooms in
jesse looks up
a second camera pans on jesse staring
move in as crackling electronic pixels fill the frame and
a bank of monitors showing jesse at the gates
a guard sits in shadow hits a button we see the gates unlock and open
pulls down the private road
shafts of light mottle then burst revealing an elegant jesse parks walks up the porch where catfish is relaxing shoulder holster revolver
and buzz cleaning a pistol
jesse nods eyes catfish
im here to see lucian
catfish grinds out his cigarette gets to his feet
hes busy right now you can come in and wait
as louis xiii pours to the rim
from elsewhere in the room this operation of yours has become big business
you need relationships now more than ever
the voice belongs to richard morris s
he sits in a leather chair facing lucian adams whos face we cannot see
seated next to morris is daniel kiersey
weve done business successfully before mr
but its a larger scope now
im here today because i want to represent you exclusively
you need someone lobbying at a state level as well as in washington
my organization can provide both
weve got contacts that you dont have and other people cant get
now im aware that you have multiple businesses
however you need one go to guy so that all your ventures stay coordinated and all transactions and contracts are realized
i am that person mr
thats what i do
lucians hand lifts the cognac out of frame drinks
whats this going to cost us
as a retainer i want an advance of three hundred fifty thousand along with ten percent of whatever economic benefit i bring to this organization
thats out of line
if you want a quality global economic plan thats what you pay for well give you two mr
thats what its worth
morris goes suddenly silent looks across at lucian
the advance is a drop in the bucket
the real money is the percentage
its in your interest to see it my way
morris stares across the desk several tense moments
then youve got a deal
morris emerges from the office
he glances at jesse then shrugs on his coat and leaves
jesse looks back at the office doorway
follow jesse in
past kiersey behind a massive desk in this impeccable room we finally see lucian adams
jesse is not invited to sit
to kiersey give us a minute
kiersey walks out and shuts the door
he crosses slowly to a credenza selects a clean shirt
you have a son now right
as he removes the shirt hes wearing reveal tattoos black sun on his back
german runes ss bolts hrungnirs heart
and around his stomach a belt of norse gods with the words invisible empire
prison tats dark and aged
whatd you name him
i named him ray
lucian no emotion puts on a pressed dress shirt fastens cuff links
over his shoulder heard the cops smacked you around inside
wasnt too bad
lucian checks his hair
youve been a busy man jesse
more ways than one
looks like you done just fine without me
business rollin through the door
and lucian finally turns looks at jesse eyes measuring
last i saw you you asked for time
time to raise a family
time to straighten things out
pause i gave you that time
then safe jobs start poppin up
the boys they think its niggers gone widespread on a hunt for pigs feet
but they all professional
hot weld oxygen
laid out burned laid back perfect
locked on jesse i knew right then and there only a white respectable burglar couldve done this
jesse smiles slightly
they know each other well
when lucians smile suddenly drops
theres a flash of controlled anger across his face and we feel a curtain of tension fall heavily on the room
with all the work you been doin diamonds
a dozen safe jobs behind my back
predatory wheres the tribute to the greater cause
jesse he pulls from his pocket a tiny pouch
sets it on the desk
he pours the contents into lucians palm diamonds and like i said i just needed time
lucian approaches the desk opens the pouch diamonds and emeralds
a slow smile spreads across his face
well even prophets stumble once in a while
lucian embraces jesse
then softly in his ear its a shame about your brother
as they part their eyes meet
something passes between them
jesse at the wheel glances nervously in the rearview
lynn in the passenger seat baby in her lap
theyre driving under the cover of darkness
i dont understand
why do we have to leave the state
youre not tellin me something
youre not tellin me a lot
it aint safe here no more

marandino looks through binoculars as an electric fence slides back
jesses truck approaches drives through
a twin engine plane idylls
lines of blue lights strobe like rivers air traffic above
and bud leaning against a nearby car with shepard and cobb
jesse helps lynn and the baby from his truck
together they walk toward the plane
bud watching from a distance nods to lynn
jesse and lynn stare at each other
shes crying as he pulls her close one arm around the baby
he says something to them we cannot hear
then with the baby lynn boards her plane
an agent shuts the door
the engine screams to life taking off
jesse turns to shield his face
lights strobe and blast
then abrupt darkness and silence
now alone on the tarmac
bud approaches then
lucian took the stones
talked about jobs
high end boxcar
your familys safe now
beat lets go to work
several ab soldiers stand watch as jesse pushes a heavy drill through a jewelers vault door
jesse throws tumbler and relock mechanisms aside reaches in

give him a no show at the trucking firm
as he writes construction on the building morris brought us in south east florida is complete
every unit sold
we should see revenues of one point four million over our original projections
lucian lights a cigar smoke curls from his lips
lastly our friends from the middle east
they put a final offer on the table

political targets mostly on the basis of our approval
beat i advise we do a test case
perhaps a sample of their resources

headquarters for the baton rouge operation
a beehive of government activity
technicians listen to tapes

fitch annoyed but staying on track
we need jesse to engage lucian on the record

hes disconnected from everything like a ghost
bud cooling his heels
as the phones ring and ring
a violent rainfall
aerial shot swooping along the highway then rising above the deep woods to reveal a truck stop ahead
closed for construction
a van arrives
a blinking barricade is pulled back allowing entrance
generators light the scene a group of shiite muslims wait by a pair of idle freight trucks
a crew of five ab soldiers exit the van jesse catfish and buzz among them
the door to one freight truck rolls to the top revealing a converted assault weaponry showcase
below covered scaffolding both crews stand
guns bulge through their coats
no sudden movement
shiites watch jesse and catfish examine the merchandise semi everyone looks at each other
jesse acknowledges worth
catfish pulls a large canvas bag from the van filled with cash
as he carries it toward a bench a large shiite omar reaches for the bag before catfish can set it down
both men hold tight
neither letting go
and theres a moment
catfish and omar are eye to eye
then catfish lets go with a smile go head
the shiite leader naseem sees the strife
there a problem
moneys all there
omar hands the bag to naseem
the count starts
both crews watch closely
all except catfish fixated on omar who stares back
the fuck you lookin at
the count stops
naseem looks to omar
questions in arabic go back and forth
the pressure getting to the group
low catfish would you shut the fuck up
this aint the time
to catfish yes listen to your boss

everyone reaches for their guns
threats shouted in arabic and english

suddenly arc lights behind a distant barrier ignite flooding the scene
over a loud speaker omar reaches for the bag of cash
catfish fires point blank shooting omar in the face
and world war iii erupts
shiites return fire
from several stakeout locations atf agents deploy and open fire
jesse is grazed in the shoulder slips staggers runs
shiite fires three shot bursts at ab whos blown apart
a generator and atf collapse
atf and with pump shotguns open up on the abs van

atf re emerges kneels and pumps shots into the mercedes
jesse has taken off past the lumber storage
catfish and buzz follow breaking for the freight truck
in the mercedes driver is blown apart by atf
the car crashes into a dumpster knocking naseem out
jesse catfish and buzz jump into the freight
shiite trying to climb in is shot down
jesse behind the wheel
burns rubber pulling out of the stop over and through a scaffold collapsing it
the freight truck draws everyones fire
jesse pilots it through the chaos
scaffold dragging behind
jesses pov where hes going
an opening in the construction leads back to the highway and oncoming traffic
atf cars speeds in the opposite way
and the freight makes the highway scattering traffic to the sound of ongoing gunfire
the moon hangs low as jesse parks the freight truck among tall grass where a vacant bread truck is waiting
as catfish exits the truck
jesse takes catfishs gun grabs him by the neck and slams him against the cab
face to face
youre a piece of work catfish
buzz grabs at jesse jesse hurls him to the ground
them niggers crossed the line
i had to burn em you had to keep your mouth shut

jesse slams him back again
holds his throat
low deadly fuck me up again you hear me

catfish glares then concedes
unload the fuckin truck
jesse starts moving crates from the freight onto the bread truck
catfish and buzz watch for a moment then join
televisions broadcast news coverage of the shoot out
agents work uncomfortable as bud and fitch argue
keep your voice down
this was out of my control
im telling you your agents best pull their shit together
who the hell yall trying to protect
this is a joint task force with multiple agendas that run up the chain of command through me
intel came forth at the eleventh hour that naseem kazuri an international arms dealer would be present at this meet
atf was tasked to observe and report
that aint what they did
because your informant my informant thats right
your informant and his psychopath crew greased half our political interests over a bag of fake cash
you werent informed so what
well i better be informed
cause this aint fallin short
now any of yall got a collaborative agenda in the works
i want to see it
these other agencies what time lines they lookin at
what deadlines and why
above your pay grade overlapping and is there a purposeful lack of communication between competing agencies who are right now charting future mistakes as we fuckin speak
thats not your concern carter
braddock suddenly arrives steps into the room
were not talkin about me
youre over involved here
and buds taken off stride
braddock looks bud right in the eyes so theres no doubt
ill handle this
bud red with anger walks out
braddock watches him go
fitch comes over relieved
thanks for coming down mike
hes been berating my agents for the last hour
braddock pours a cup of coffee
were trying to band aid a situation here and frankly carters preference for thug tactics isnt helping
itll all be in my report
interrupts isnt helping
a big mistake
now braddock turns on fitch zeroing in
lets not miss what happened here fitch
we work for the same cause doesnt mean we work for you
what are you gonna do now
send jesse back out
earn his trust
bud carter delivered the biggest informant in the history of this state to your lap and you and the people you work for are gonna let it go to shit
beat you can expect that will be in my report
steelworkers warped in heat waves swing ingots into troughs
the seven story furnace is deafening
lucian is met by kiersey
they walk together through glassed in hallways to a closed office door
lucian keys in revealing a disheveled morris seated in a chair with two large ab soldiers on either side
lucian shuts the door and sits before an ill at ease morris
i had no previous knowledge of any business with muslims
so if stealing me here in the middle of the night is some kind of accusation im not accusing you mr
but i do find it interesting that right about the time i employ you my operation starts having problems
yes but that is interesting
morris swallows hard as lucian stares intensely
i want to know if this was an isolated incident
if the atf impeding on my work is the result of a deeper threat
what are you suggesting
im suggesting you contact your friends in washington
with all due respect mr
adams thats not what i was retained for
well now it is
that sort of information requires clearance i dont have
if i start sniffing around people are going to ask questions
im asking questions mr
and im getting impatient
morris gets stone quiet
lucian hands him a phone
you dont leave here till i get answers
and like that this conversation is over
off a deserted street
a dense fog resides far as the eye can see
and jesse in a phone booth drops a dime and dials
clearly asleep hello
off jesses silence honey you alright
just need to hear your voice
hows little ray
ill put him on
silence for a moment
then a quiet babys voice
its daddy on the phone say hello
emotion rises to jesses face
he holds it in barely
a lone car is parked in the shadows fog rolling past
jesse sees it cant see whos inside it
he hangs up
a long moment
jesse stands there watching the car
he slowly makes his way toward the back of the store where his truck is parked
pulse pounding he tries the door
eyeing the car he unlocks his truck
theres sudden movement
and out of the darkness steps bud ready to pounce
where the hell you been
jesses look two days missin you broke protocol

agentsll hunt your ass down
anger spiking pacing i cant keep doin this

jesse stares a malevolence in his eyes that freezes bud to the spot
then jesse climbs in his truck and drives off

morris a nervous wreck unshaven sits across from lucian
kiersey at an adjacent table
theres an investigation underway funded by the u

morris opens his briefcase and hands over a pair of dossiers
theyre receiving assistance from both the atf and fbi who are stationed right here in henderson

lucian sets a photo on the table face down with an address written on back
jesse flips over the photo its bud in uniform

he forces out the words its done
with that lucian gets up and leaves disappearing into darkness
jesse climbs into his truck and pulls out to the street
jesses truck heading up the interstate crossing into east baton rouge then driving through dark residential streets of buds neighborhood
he pulls to the curb parks
jesse racks a mossberg sg loads it with solid shot then lays the gun on his lap

tom calm and alert looks to his right sees a childs bicycle parked on the sidewalk
a backpack affixed to the handlebars
a cargo van pulls up and parks
the labor team abandons it dumping gloves and outer clothing into plastic bags the bags go in the back of a waiting suburban
catfish takes the wheel
the crew climbs in drives away
his face begins to tremble
eyes press shut
they fill with moisture as he looks away
hold on bud
struggling to hide his own emotion
and he walks out
moving with bud as he heads for the exit
under harsh fluorescents
its a madhouse outside
a crowd is gathered around a police action in progress
medics are tending to the broken nose of a bartender pete in his s
metro cop stands by

bud flips another table
continues talking to the chair as if someone were in it

bud holsters his gun and beats the shit out of the chair
bud spins glass eyed and red faced
his wavering vision can barely make out cobb and marandino approaching

bud stands his ground tries to keep his balance
lets go home
theres a long moment
bud stares at his crew gone
then hes suddenly overwhelmed with emotion
two fbi agents and walk together down this sterile corridor
they stop outside jesses closed door
a uniformed police officer is posted there reading a newspaper

fbi signs the chart
the two agents enter
jesses bed is empty
the window open
check the bathroom
fbi opens the bathroom door
both agents hurry to the window see outside a large tree six feet out from the ledge and a broken branch at street level
a seemingly impossible escape route

a badly hung over bud sits with braddock fitch and numerous agents around a conference table
walks the room says to all this is an atrocity gentlemen
incompetence at its highest level

as everyone files out
braddock says low to bud you smell like a fuckin distillery bud

everything else and now this
a metal door rises up
jesse in silhouette steps in
a bare bulb comes to light
mottled with fly excrement
jesse unlocks and opens several samsonite suitcases
stacked in grey packing foam are rows and rows of guns
jesse hefts his choices
checking line and breach a gauge shotgun
a remington sawed off with pistol grip
les baer tactical
glock semi auto mm
gallon gas cans
he loads up a gym bag
jesse pulls scissors from a grooming kit and stands before a grimy mirror
he cuts off his hair
then using clippers shaves his scalp and mustache
jesse yanks a tarp off a beat up chrysler
pops the trunk
throws in the gym bag
then drives away
a lone dilapidated house boat sits heavily in the bayou
lights on inside
dense fog overlays
long hair on the couch watching tv drinking liquor
speed metal music blasts from a stereo somewhere
theres a metallic bang o
long hair looks up
the screen door rattles
long hair grabs an aluminum bat slowly approaching
sudden surprise as the screen snaps off and a silhouette breaks the glass opens it
what the fuck
long hair rushes for the door as the butt of a gauge slams long hair collapses with a shattered knee and muted scream
jesse steps in racking the gauge with one hand takes aim on the helpless long hair writhing on the floor
the front lights go out
a terrible darkness
a door flies open
jesse eyes darting pushes long hair in
bandaged hand clamped to the collar
shotgun at the neck
they move down a dark hallway
speed metal throbs growing louder
long hair gash gushing leg crunches with each step
they turn another hallway
light spills from under a door shadows behind it
jesse edges long hair forward reaches the doorway creeps through
the door swings wide on the room revealing buzz on the bed furiously fucking a dark haired hooker over a bureau
as long hair rounds the corner
buzz looks up sees jesse
dives for a gun
everything explodes at once
the wall detonates and buzz goes down
blood juts from his side
he tries to get up
the hooker screams and cowers terrified in the corner
jesse pumps aims through the haze and fires again
music cuts out plunging us into silence
jesse tosses clothes to the hooker
the hooker does
buzz and long hair back to back
hands and feet tied
jesse circles them with the shotgun
the boat rocks gently
we got some shit to discuss
buzz to jesse unintimidated aint got nothin to say to you wheeler
top of his lungs i need a doctor
i need a fuckin doctor
in one motion jesse racks the shotgun thrusts the barrel to long hairs chin and blows his head off
buzz screams rears up chair collapses beneath him dragging a dead long hair along the floor still tied together
jesse yanks buzz up
his chair rocks upright into place
i dont know
jesse punctuates shotgun butt against buzzs head
jesse strikes again connects
buzz goes down in a heap eyes swollen purple slits
his skull gushing red
jesse steps over buzz pins the shotgun to his jaw
who killed my family
ah shit man
jesse shifts his aim an inch pulls the trigger
shot reverbs hard
buzz screams hysteria
racks another shell jesse puts down the shotgun
pulls from his gym bag two cans of gasoline one of which he splashes over buzzs face
flinches the fuck is that
sniffs realizes jesse pours the rest over buzz and the lifeless long hair
thrashing as buzz pleads for his life jesse unloads the shotgun dead aim
instantly a fire erupts
buzz and long hairs corpses burn
jesse empties the other can of gas feeding the flames
the jesse stands there the heat reflects the intensity in his face
for a moment its a vision in hell
engulfed in flames
sirens and lights as fire trucks and fire boats douse the burning boat with hard water
among a crowd of spectators the shaken hooker is being questioned by marandino
bud and cobb stand apart
weve had a tap on kierseys line forty eight hours now
whatevers hes up to bud it aint comin through the front door
bud starts leaving the scene
suddenly fitch and two agents barge forward
we need to talk
get out of my way fitch
following bud this is my investigation
jesses cowboy bullshit is not how its done
while your agents build their cases and set for court hell erase the debt owed to all of you
so youre implying i should thank him
bud shakes his head in disgust keeps walking
look carter whether we like it or not you and i have to work together on this
we entice jesse back
ill get him full protection if he agrees to testify
thatll never happen

jesse wouldnt be in this situation
and you wouldnt be askin stupid fuckin questions
walking away ill bring him in myself

bud storms off
lynn stumbles through the woods holding her baby
their skin bleached out
were in a dream
a sadistic enhancement
his familys image dissolves inside them
widen to reveal jesse before a cracked mirror in a service station bathroom
perspiring he re bandages his hand as blood swirls down the drain
an expensively dressed kiersey emerges from a courtroom flanked by a pair of well dressed aides
get back to the office
follow up on the arthur bierce case
i need names and numbers on my desk by three pm
the aides scurry down another corridor as kiersey exits the building through the glass front doors
kiersey moves to a parked cadillac pops the trunk and sets his briefcase inside when
a rushing pov from behind slams the trunk on kierseys hands
kiersey screams drops to his knees
his wrists wedged in the trunk

bud finds a pager on kierseys slacks yanks it off
then leans down with a smile venomous youre a dead man kiersey
bud storms off
kiersey on the ground a trembling mess
catfish does a rail of meth off the counter
he lights a cigarette and sits down in a re upholstered lazy boy where a tattoo artist is setting up
catfish proffers his forearm displaying a row of notches kills
and tattoo artist begins to outline two more

without warning jesse grabs the pliers
a flash of movement and theres a terrible scream as catfishs front tooth is ripped out
he bucks violently in his chair
jesse jams the drill into catfishs gums high speed
loud electric pain and catfish cries out in terror
jesse sets down the drill deadpan

a gunshot rips through jesses left arm
the sawed off drops to his side
jesse turns edgar bingham is firing a service revolver shots miss as jesse dives behind the bar
harold kay is moving down the stairwell
firing an automatic wildly
bottles and glasses explode
bingham keeps firing
bullets splinter wood jesse slams another magazine into the
above him strays catch lights glass filaments explode
bud kicks down a door
ab charges out
grabs for bud
who breaks the grab pulls ab s neck down slams his knee into his forehead twice knocked cold
grabs his gun
ab emerges hammering gunshots
shots blow holes in the wall
and ab steps out draws
bud throws him in the way of cross fire
ab takes ab s shots
bud aims past
ab is hit dead center and drops like an oak
both men dead
that fast and bud is on the move
ab and run out and swing their smgs firing onto the alley and killing marandino
then charging to the front cobb fires
ab is blown apart as ab fires back hitting cobb in the vest
his ribs broken he sits down stunned
into radio im hit
im fuckin hit
ab running past as several black and whites now arrive
take and return fire ab is shot dead
civilians running as
jesse rises over the bar firing bursts into kay who tumbles down the stairwell like a rag doll
bingham shoots jesse in the hip
he staggers then falls and rolls to his back
bingham rounds the bar just as jesse somehow lifts the
and fires two slugs into binghams chest
bingham collapses on top of jesse
hits the floor
both men bleeding profusely thrash along the floor
bud racing toward a stairwell leaps down a flight turns and runs down another
jesse trapped under the heavy bingham pulls the buck knife from his holster and sinks it into binghams kidney
jesse rolls the big man over hoists himself high and impales bingham through the throat
jesse exhales struggles up
rising to his feet
out of nowhere
jesse collapses a bundle of twitching lucian turns slow
toward a cracked mirror
lucian points his gun at buds head who reaches for the trigger guard shifts the barrel an inch a round goes off bud flips lucian over rips the gun away
lucian tries to break free
bud grabs him smashes the gun over and over against lucians face
lucians head bounces
eyes roll then right
lucian quarter rolls then cracks a forearm into buds head
again and bud is knocked back with a gash over his eye
lucian rears back and kicks hard into buds sternum
bud tackles him into a table which goes down
a chair breaks
bud lands a thunderous hook and lucians nose shatters
another and his cheekbone caves
lucian drops like a rock
tries to crawl under another table
in a maniacal rage bud flips the table and stomps down on lucian with furious blows that come one after another
lucian tries to cover up
bud is all over him
grabs lucian by the throat and presses down
lucian fighting to breathe digs his nails into buds face tearing skin
buds face twists with hate as he chokes the life out of him
lucians eyes bulge
his mouth stretches wide
clutching at buds fingers trying to pull away
bud snorts tightens his grip
and at the last moment the cop in him reemerges
bud lets go
lucian rolls to his side and coughs up a thick ribbon of blood and vomit
bud slams on restraints
bud staggers to his feet
spots jesse on the floor
and he slows
jesse lies in shadow
we cannot see his face
only the dark pool of blood around him
lucian passes out
into radio i got him
i got lucian
as police come in
over bodies and blood and guns and up the stairs and out a broken window to the crowds in the street held back by police past flashing lights and emergency
to where life goes on in new orleans
the sun is out
the sky above is clear
on bud as he leads lucian through the bowels of city lock up
lucian in prison garbs haggard dark bruises looks up as they pass a two way mirror of an interrogation room sees
seated making statements to shepard who is taking notes
stacks of jesses reports surround them
bud walks lucian past into
and lucian sits at a table
bud across from him
silence hangs several moments
starting again knowing
theres something bigger
a slow smile spreads
want a cup of coffee
