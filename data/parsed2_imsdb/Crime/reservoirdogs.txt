quentin tarantinos october this movie is dedicated to these following sources of inspiration andre detoth eight men dressed in black suits sit around a table at a breakfast cafe
they are mr
blue and the big boss joe cabot
most are finished eating and are enjoying coffee and conversation
joe flips through a small address book
pink is telling a long and involved story about madonna
like a virgin is all about a girl who digs a guy with a big dick
the whole song is a metaphor for big dicks
no its not
its about a girl who is very vulnerable and shes been fucked over a few times
then she meets some guy whos really sensitive whoa
time out greenbay
tell that bullshit to the tourists
looking through his address book toby
who the fuck is toby
its not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy
now granted thats what true blue is about no argument about that
which one is true blue
you dont remember true blue
that was a big ass hit for madonna
shit i dont even follow this tops in pops shit and ive at least heard of true blue
look asshole i didnt say i aint heard of it
all i asked was how does it go
excuse me for not being the worlds biggest madonna fan
i hate madonna
i like her early stuff
you know lucky star borderline but once she got into her papa dont preach phase i dont know i tuned out

youre gonna make me lose my train of thought
oh fuck tobys that little china girl
i found this old address book in a jacket i aint worn in a coons age
what the fuck was her last name
where was i
you said true blue was about a nice girl who finds a sensitive fella
but like a virgin was a metaphor for big dicks
let me tell ya what like a virgin s about
its about some cooze whos a regular fuck machine
i mean all the time morning day night afternoon dick dick dick dick dick dick dick dick dick dick dick
how many dicks was that
then one day she meets a john holmes motherfucker and its like whoa baby
this mother fuckers like charles bronson in the great escape
hes diggin tunnels
now shes gettin this serious dick action shes feelin something she aint felt since forever
it hurts her
it shouldnt hurt
her pussy should be bubble yum by now
but when this cat fucks her it hurts
it hurts like the first time
the pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin
hence like a virgin
the fellas crack up
fuck you wrong
what the fuck do you know about it anyway
youre still listening to jerry fucking vale
not wrong dumb ass wong
you know like the chinese name
white snatches the address book from joes hand
they fight but theyre not really mad at each other
give me this fucking thing
what the fuck do you think youre doin

joe you want me to shoot him for you
shit you shoot me in a dream you better wake up and apologize
have you guys been listening to k billys super sounds of the seventies weekend
yeah its fuckin great isnt it
can you believe the songs they been playin
no i cant
you know what i heard the other day
heartbeat its lovebeat by little tony defranco and the defranco family
i havent heard that since i was in fifth fuckin grade
when i was coming down here i was playin it
and the night the lights went out in georgia came on
now i aint heard that song since it was big but when it was big i heard it a million trillion times
im listening to it this morning and this was the first time i ever realized that the lady singing the song was the one who killed andy
you didnt know vicki lawrence killed the guy
i thought the cheatin wife shot andy
they say it in the song
i know i heard it
i musta zoned out whenever that part came on before
i thought when she said that little sister stuff she was talkin about her sister in law the cheatin wife
no she did it
she killed the cheatin wife too
you know the part in gypsies tramps and theives when she says poppa woulda shot his if he knew what hed done
i could never figure out what he did
the table laughs
the waitress comes over to the table
she has the check and a pot of coffee
can i get anybody more coffee
no were gonna be hittin it
ill take care of the check
she hands the bill to him
here ya go
please pay at the register if you wouldnt mind
you guys have a wonderful day
they all mutter equivalents
she exits and joe stands up
ill take care of this you guys leave the tip
white and when i come back i want my book back
sorry its my book now
blonde shoot this piece of shit will ya
blonde shoots mr
white with his finger
mr white acts shot
okay everybody cough up green for the little lady
everybody whips out a buck and throws it on the table
everybody that is except mr
cmon throw in a buck
i dont tip
whaddaya mean you dont tip
i dont believe in it
you dont believe in tipping
laughing i love this kid hes a madman this guy
do you have any idea what these ladies make
they make shit
dont give me that
she dont make enough money she can quit
i dont even know a jew whod have the balls to say that
so lets get this straight
you never ever tip
i dont tip because society says i gotta
i tip when somebody deserves a tip
when somebody really puts forth an effort they deserve a little something extra
but this tipping automatically that shits for the birds
as far as im concerned theyre just doin their job
our girl was nice
our girl was okay
she didnt do anything special
whats something special take ya in the kitchen and suck your dick
they all laugh
id go over twelve percent for that
look i ordered coffee
now weve been here a long fuckin time and shes only filled my cup three times
when i order coffee i want it filled six times
what if shes too busy
the words too busy shouldnt be in a waitresss vocabulary
excuse me mr
white but the last thing you need is another cup of coffee
they all laugh
these ladies arent starvin to death
they make minimum wage
when i worked for minimum wage i wasnt lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy
ahh now were getting down to it
its not just that hes a cheap bastard it is that too it is that too
but its also he couldnt get a waiter job
you talk like a pissed off dishwasher fuck those cunts and their fucking tips
so you dont care that theyre counting on your tip to live
white rubs two of his fingers together
do you know what this is
its the worlds smallest violin playing just for the waitresses
you dont have any idea what youre talking about
these people bust their ass
this is a hard job
sos working at mcdonalds but you dont feel the need to tip them
theyre servin ya food you should tip em
but no society says tip these guys over here but not those guys over there
they work harder than the kids at mcdonalds
oh yeah i dont see them cleaning fryers
these people are taxed on the tips they make
when you stiff em you cost them money
waitressing is the number one occupation for female non college graduates in this country
its the one jab basically any woman can get and make a living on
the reason is because of tips
fuck all that
they all laugh
hey im very sorry that the government taxes their tips
thats fucked up
but that aint my fault
it would appear that waitresses are just one of the many groups the government fucks in the ass on a regular basis
you show me a paper says the government shouldnt do that ill sign it
put it to a vote ill vote for it
but what i wont do is play ball
and this non college bullshit youre telling me i got two words for that learn to fuckin type
cause if youre expecting me to help out with the rent youre in for a big fuckin surprise
hes convinced me
give me my dollar back
joes comes back to the table
okay ramblers lets get to rambling
wait a minute who didnt throw in
he dont tip
orange he dont tip
white you dont tip
he dont believe in it
orange he dont believe in it
white you dont believe in it
orange shut up
white cough up the buck ya cheap bastard i paid for your goddamn breakfast
because you paid for the breakfast im gonna tip
normally i wouldnt
just throw in your dollar and lets move
blonde see what im dealing with here
im fuckin dealin with infants
the eight men get up to leave
whites waist is in the f
as he buttons his coat for a second we see hes carrying a gun
they exit uncle bobs pancake house talking amongst themselves
when the credit sequence is finished we fade to black over the black we hear the sound of someone screaming in agony
under the screaming we hear the sound of a car hauling ass through traffic
over the screams and the traffic noise we hear somebody just hold on buddy boy
somebody stops screaming long enough to say im sorry
i cant believe she killed me
who wouldve fuckin thought that
the somebody screaming is mr
he lies in the backseat
hes been shot in the stomach
blood covers both him and the backseat
white is the somebody else
hes behind the wheel of the getaway car
hes easily doing mph dodging in and out of traffic
though hes driving for his life he keeps talking to his wounded passenger in the backseat
they are the only two in the car
hey just cancel that shit right now
youre hurt really fucking bad but you aint dying
crying all this blood is scaring the shit outta me
im gonna die i know it
oh excuse me i didnt realize you had a degree in medicine
are you a doctor
are you a doctor
answer me please are you a doctor
no im not
ahhhh so you admit you dont know what youre talking about
so if youre through giving me your amateur opinion lie back and listen to the news
im taking you back to the rendezvous joes gonna get you a doctor the doctors gonna fix you up and youre gonna be okay
now say it youre gonna be okay
say it youre gonna be okay
orange doesnt respond
white starts pounding on the steering wheel
say the goddamn words youre gonna be okay
the camera does a around an empty warehouse
then the door swings open and mr
white carries the bloody body of mr
orange still is moaning loudly from his bullet hit
white lays him down upon a mattress on the floor
just hold on buddy boy
hold on and wait for joe
i cant do anything for you but when joe gets here which should be anytime now hell be able to help you
were just gonna sit here and wait for joe
who are we waiting for
bet your sweet ass we are
white gets up from over mr
orange and starts to prowl around the warehouse
yelling dont leave me
mr white bends back over him and takes his hand
i aint going anywhere
im right here
im not gonna leave ya
larry im so scared would you please hold me
white very gently embraces the bloody mr
cradling the young man mr
white whispers to him
whispering go ahead and be scared youve been brave enough for one day
i want you to just relax now
youre not gonna die youre gonna be fine
when joe gets here hell make ya a hundred percent again
white lays mr
orange back down on the mattress
hes still holding his hand
orange looks up at his friend
look i dont wanna be a fly in the ointment but if help doesnt come soon i gotta see a doctor
i dont give a fuck about jail i just dont wanna die
youre not gonna fucking die all right
i wasnt born yesterday
im hurt and im hurt bad
its not good
hey bless your heart for what youre trying to do
i was panicking for a moment but ive got my senses back now
the situation is im shot in the belly
and without medical attention im gonna die
i can take you to a hospital
i dont give a shit about jail
but i cant die
you dont have to take me in
just drive me up to the front drop me on the sidewalk
ill take care of myself
i wont tell them anything
i swear to fucking god i wont tell em anything
look in my eyes look right in my eyes
white does i wont tell them anything
youll be safe
lie back down and try to im going to die
i need a doctor
im begging you take me to a doctor
orange lays his head back on the mattress
spent from his outburst he quietly mutters to himself take me to a doctor take me to a doctor please
suddenly the warehouse door bursts open and mr
pink steps inside
was that a fucking set up or what
pink sees mr
orange on the floor shot and bloody
oh fuck orange got tagged
throughout this scene we hear mr
oh thats just fucking great
how did he die
how the fuck do you think
the cops shot him
oh this is bad this is so bad
referring to mr
orange is it bad
as opposed to good
this is so fucked up
somebody fucked us big time
you really think we were set up
you even doubt it
i dont think we got set up i know we got set up
i mean really seriously where did all those cops come from huh
one minute theyre not there the next minute theyre there
i didnt hear any sirens
the alarm went off okay
okay when an alarm goes off you got an average of four minutes response time
unless a patrol car is cruising that street at that particular moment you got four minutes before they can realistically respond
in one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there
all loaded for bear all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing and they were all just there
remember that second wave that showed up in the cars
those were the ones responding to the alarm
but those other motherfuckers were already there they were waiting for us
pause you havent thought about this
i havent had a chance to think
first i was just trying to get the fuck outta there
and after we got away ive just been dealin with him
well you better start thinking about it
cause i sure as fuck am thinking about it
in fact thats all im thinking about
i came this close to just driving off
whoever set us up knows about this place
there couldve been cops sitting here waiting for me
for all we know theres cops driving fast on their way here now
lets go in the other room
the camera creeps along a wall coming to a corner
we move past it and see down a hall
at the end of the hall is a bathroom
the bathroom door is partially closed restricting our view
pink is obscured but mr
white is in view
what the fuck am i doing here
i felt funny about this job right off
as soon as i felt it i should said no thank you and walked
but i never fucking listen
every time i ever got burned buying weed i always knew the guy wasnt right
i just felt it
but i wanted to believe him
if hes not lyin to me and it really is thai stick then whoa baby
but its never thai stick
and i always said if i felt that way about a job id walk
and i did and i didnt because of fuckin money
whats done is done i need you cool
are you cool
splash some water on your face
take a breather
we hear the sink running and mr
pink splashing water on his face
im gonna get me my smokes
mr white opens the bathroom door walks down the hall and out of frame
we see mr
pink his back turned towards us bent over the sink
then he grabs a towels and dries his face
mr white enters frame with a pack of chesterfields in his hand
want a smoke
the two men light up
okay lets go through what happened
were in the place everythings going fine
then the alarm gets tripped
i turn around and all these cops are outside
youre right it was like bam
i blink my eyes are theyre there
everybody starts going apeshit
blonde starts shootin all the thats not correct
whats wrong with it
the cops didnt show up after the alarm went off
they didnt show till after mr
blonde started shooting everyone
as soon as i heard the alarm i saw the cops
im telling ya it wasnt that soon
they didnt let their presence be known until after mr
blonde went off
im not sayin they werent there im sayin they were there
but they didnt move in till mr
blonde became a madman
thats how i know we were set up
you can see that cant you mr
look enough of this mr white shit dont tell me your name i dont want to know
i sure as hell aint gonna tell ya mine
youre right this is bad
pause how did you get out
shot my way out
everybody was shooting so i just blasted my way outta there
pink is hauling ass down a busy city sidewalk
he has a canvas bag with a shoulder strap in one hand and a
magnum in the other
if any bystanders get in his way he just knocks them down
we dolly at the same speed right along side of him
four policemen are running after mr
we dolly with them
we dolly with a young woman on roller skates
rollergirl is plugged into a walkman
we hear the song shes listening to loud over the soundtrack
shes twirling and skating backwards to the beat of the song
rollergirl turns a corner and collides with mr
the man and woman crash to the ground
pink rolls into the street in front of a moving car that screeches to a stop narrowly avoiding running over him
the camera is in the backseat
a shocked woman is the cars driver
pink pulls himself up from the hood shakes it off and points his magnum at the driver
get outta the car
get the fuck outta the car
the shocked woman starts screaming
pink tries to open the drivers side door but its locked
open the fucking door
pink smashes it in our face
dolly with cops coming up fast
pink drags the shocked woman out of the car
the cops reach the corner guns aimed
using the car as a shield mr
pink fires three shots at the cops
everybody hits the ground or scatters
pink hops in the car
camera in the backseat mr
pink floors it
speeding down the street with the cops firing after him
pink and mr
white still talking in the bathroom
tagged a couple of cops
did you kill anybody
a few cops
no real people
uh uh just cops
could you believe mr
that was one of the most insane fucking things ive ever seen
why the fuck would joe hire somebody like that
i dont wanna kill anybody
but if i gotta get out that door and youre standing in my way one way of the other youre gettin outta my way
thats the way i look at it
a choice between doin ten years and takin out some stupid motherfucker aint no choice at all
but i aint no madman either
what the fuck was joe thinkin
you cant work with a guy like that
that mother fuckers unstable
what do you think
do you think he panicked or ya think hes just trigger happy
i think hes a sick fuckin maniac
were awful goddamn lucky he didnt tag us when he shot up the place
i came this fucking close hold up two fingers and makes a tiny space between them to taking his ass out myself
when things get tense everybody panics
i dont care what your name is you cant help it
its human nature
but ya panic on the inside
ya panic in your head
ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic then you get a grip and deal with the situation
what you dont do is shoot up the place and kill everybody
what youre supposed to do is act like a fuckin professional
a psychopath is not a professional
you cant work with a psychopath cause ya dont know what those sick assholes are gonna do next
i mean jesus christ how old do you think that black girl was
twenty maybe twenty one
did ya see what happened to anybody else
me and mr
orange jumped in the car and mr
brown floored it
after that i dont know what went down
at that point it became every man for himself
as far as mr
blonde or mr
blue are concerned i aint got the foggiest
once i got out i never looked back
what do you think
what do i think
i think the cops caught them or killed em
not even a chance they punched through
you found a hole
yeah and that was a fucking miracle
but if they did get away where the fuck are they
you dont think its possible one of them got ahold of the diamonds and pulled a nope
how can you be so sure
i got the diamonds
i got em all right
are they out in the car
no theyre not in the car
no i dont have them on me
ya wanna go with me and get em
yes we can go right now
but first listen to what im telling you
we were fuckin set up
somebody is in league with the cops
we got a judas in our midst
and im thinkin we should have our fuckin heads examined for waiting around here
that was the plan we meet here
then where is everybody
i say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house
we aint got the slightest fuckin idea what happened to mr
blonde or mr
they could both be dead or arrested
they could be sweatin em down at the station house right now
yeah they dont know the names but they can sing about this place
i mean that could be happening right now
as we speak the cops could be in their cars drivin here this minute
i swear to god im fuckin jinxed
two jobs back it was a four man job we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop
thank god we discovered in time
we hadda forget the whole fuckin thing
just walked away from it
so whos the rat this time
its joes show he set this whole thing up
maybe he set it up to set it up
i dont buy it
me and joe go back a long time
i can tell ya straight up joe definitely didnt have anything to do with this bullshit
oh you and joe go back a long time
i known joe since i was a kid
but me saying joe definitely couldnt have done it is ridiculous
i can say i definitely didnt do it cause i know what i did or didnt do
but i cant definitely say that about anybody else cause i dont definitely know
for all i know youre the rat
for all i know youre the rat
now youre using your head
for all we know hes the rat
pink points offscreen to mr
whites expression changes
they run over to mr
orange whos unconscious
the camera hovers over the action
pink reaches him first
is he dead
white pushes him out of the way
he feels the pulse on mr
so is he dead or what
he aint dead
so what is it
i think hes just passed out
he scared the fuckin shit outta me
i thought he was dead fer sure
white stands up and walks over to a table
he will be dead fer sure if we dont get him to a hospital
we cant take him to a hospital
without medical attention this man wont live through the night
that bullet in his belly is my fault
now while that might not mean jack shit to you it means a helluva lot to me
and im not gonna just sit around and watch him die
well first things first staying heres goofy
we gotta book up
so what do you suggest we go to a hotel
we got a guy whos shot in the belly he cant walk he bleeds like a stuck pig and when hes awake he screams in pain
you gotta idea spit it out
joe could help him
if we can get in touch with joe joe could get him to a doctor joe could get a doctor to come and see him
pinks dialog we slowly zoom in to a c
assuming we can trust joe how we gonna get in touch with him
hes supposed to be here but he aint which is making me nervous about being here
even if joe is on the up and up hes probably not gonna be that happy with us
joe planned a robbery but hes got a blood bath on his hands now
dead cops dead robbers dead civilians
i tend to doubt hes gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight
if i was him id try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible
before you got here mr
orange was askin me to take him to a hospital
now i dont like turning him over to the cops but if we dont hes dead
he begged me to do it
i told him to hold off till joe got here
well joe aint gettin here
were on our own
now i dont know a goddamn body who can help him so if you know somebody call em
i dont know anybody
well i guess we drop him off at the hospital
since he dont know nothin about us i say its his decision
well he knows a little about me
you didnt tell him your name did ya
i told him my first name and where im from
there is a long silence and a blank look from mr
pink then he screams why
i told him where i was from a few days ago
it was just a casual conversation
and what was tellin him your name when you werent supposed to
pink looks at mr
white like hes retarded
we had just gotten away from the cops
he just got shot
it was my fuckin fault he got shot
hes a fuckin bloody mess hes screaming
i swear to god i thought we was gonna die right then and there
im tryin to comfort him telling him not to worry hes gonna be okay im gonna take care of him
and he asked me what my name was
i mean the man was dyin in my arms
what the fuck was i supposed to tell him sorry i cant give out that information its against the rules
i dont trust you enough
maybe i shoulda but i couldnt
oh i dont doubt is was quite beautiful dont fuckin patronize me
one question do they have a sheet on you where you told him youre from
well thats that then
i mean i was worried about mug shot possibilities already
but now he knows a what you look like b what your first name is i where youre from and d what your specialty is
they aint gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out
thats it right you didnt tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection
if i have to tell you again to back off me an you are gonna go round and round
pink walks out of the c
and turns his back on mr
whites pov pans over to him
we aint taking him to a hospital
if we dont hell die
and im very sad about that
but some fellas are lucky and some aint
that fuckin did it
whites pov charges toward mr
pink turns toward him in time to get punched hard in the mouth
white and mr
pink have a very ungraceful and realistic fight
they go at each other like a couple of alley cats
white swings and punches he screams you little motherfucker
pink yells as he hits ya wanna fuck with me
you wanna fuck with me
ill show you who youre fuckin with
the two men end up on the floor kicking and scratching
white gets mr
pink in a headlock
pink reaches in his jacket for his gun and pulls it out
white sees this immediately lets go of mr
pink and goes for his own weapon
the two men are on the floor on their knees with their guns outstretched aiming at one another
you wanna shoot me you little piece of shit
take a shot
fuck you white
i didnt create this situation im just dealin with it
youre acting like a first year fuckin thief
im actin like a professional
they get him they can get you they get you they get closer to me and that cant happen
and you you motherfucker are looking at me like its my fault
i didnt tell him my name
i didnt tell him where i was from
i didnt tell him what i knew better than to tell him
fuck fifteen minutes ago you almost told me your name
you buddy are stuck in a situation you created
so if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere throw em at a mirror
pink lowers his gun and walks towards white
so if you wanna shoot somebody put that gun in your mouth and shoot yourself
then from off screen we hear you kids dont play so rough
somebodys gonna start crying
the voice belongs to the infamous mr
blonde sits on a counter drinking a fast food coke and eating a hot dog
we thought you mightve gotten caught
blonde doesnt answer he just hops off the counter and starts walking around the warehouse checking the place out
he doesnt look at either mr
pink or mr
white he just eats his hot dog and sips his coke
this is making pink and white nervous as hell
pink tries to talk through it
we handhold follow mr
blonde around the warehouse
really how did you get away
blonde walks the loft
you saw what happened to me i found a hole and booked
blonde looks in the bathroom
we were hopin you two would be together
blonde looks out the window
that was the big question we had what happened to mr
blue and you
blonde walks away from the window
we were worried the cops got ya
blonde bends down over mr
he got it in the belly
hes still alive but wont be for long
you better start talkin to us asshole cause we got shit we need to talk about
were already freaked out we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin bag on our hip
blonde looks at his two partners in crime then moves towards them
we think we got a rat in the house
i guarantee we got a rat in the house
what would ever make you think that
is that supposed to be funny
we dont think this place is safe
this place just aint secure anymore
were leaving and you should go with us
nobodys going anywhere
silence takes over the room
blonde stops moving
after a few beats the silence is broken
pink piss on this turd were outta here
white turns to leave
dont take another step mr
white explodes raising his gun and charging towards mr
fuck you maniac
its your fuckin fault were in so much trouble
blonde calmly sits down
he looks to mr
referring to mr
white whats this guys problem

blonde is the only one i completely trust
hes too fuckin homicidal to be workin with the cops
you takin his side
what we need is a little solidarity here
somebodys stickin a red hot poker up our asses and we gotta find out whose hands on the handle
now i know im no piece of shit
referring to mr
white and im pretty sure youre a good boy
referring to mr
blonde and im fuckin positive youre on the level
so lets figure out whos the bad guy
white calms down and puts his gun away
blonde returns to the persona we saw at the beginning talking about madonna
well that was sure exciting
white youre a big lee marvin fan arent you
i dont know about the rest of you fellas but my hearts beatin fast
pause for a beat okay you guys follow me
blonde hops out of his chair and heads for the door
the other two men just follow him with their eyes
follow you where
down to my car
its a surprise
blonde walks out
three cars are parked out front
blonde is walking towards the car he drove
white and mr
pink are walking behind
the camera is handheld following behind them
we still gotta get out of here

for what the cops

blonde opens up the truck of his car
a handcuffed uniformed policeman is curled up inside the trunk
so while were waitin for nice guy eddie what say we have a little fun finding out who the rat is

he hangs up the phone stands and walks around to the front of the desk
teddy opens the office door and toothpick vic vega walks in
toothpick vic vega is none other than our very own mr
vic is dressed in a long black leather seventies style jacket
joe stands in front of his desk with his arms open
the two men embrace each other
teddy leaves closing the door behind him
hows freedom kid pretty fuckin good aint it

this is what he was doin
white acts out mr
blonde shooting everybody in the store
i told em not to touch the alarm

thats your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage
i dont like alarms
what does it matter who stays with the cop
we aint lettin him go

you shouldve never took him outta your trunk in the first place
we were trying to find out what he knew about the set up
there is no fuckin set up
eddie takes charge look this is the news
blondie you stay here and take care of them two
white and pink come with me cuz if joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front hes going to be as mad at me as he
is at you
white and mr
pink walk out of the warehouse talking amongst themselves
blonde closes the door after them
he then slowly turns his head towards the cop
alone at last
now where were we
i told you i dont know anything about any fucking set up
ive only been on the force eight months nobody tells me anything
i dont know anything
you can torture me if you want thanks dont mind if i do
your boss even said there wasnt a set up
first off i dont have a boss
are you clear about that
he slaps the cops face
i asked you a question
are you clear about that
now im not gonna bullshit you
i dont really care about what you know or dont know
im gonna torture you for awhile regardless
not to get information but because torturing a cop amuses me
theres nothing you can say theres nothing you can do
except pray for death
he puts a piece of tape over the cops mouth
blonde walks away from the cop
lets see whats on k billys super sounds of the seventies weekend
he turns on the radio
stealers wheels hit stuck in the middle with you plays over the speaker
note this entire sequence is timed to the music
blonde slowly walks toward the cop
he opens a large knife
he grabs a chair places it in front of the cop and sits in it
blonde just stares into the cops our face holding the knife singing along with the song
then like a cobra he lashes out
a slash across the face
the cop camera moves around wildly
blonde just stares into the cops our face singing along with the seventies hit
then he reaches out and cuts off the cops our ear
the cop camera moves around wildly
blonde holds the ear up to the cop us to see
blonde rises kicking the chair he was sitting on out of the way
we follow mr blonde as he walks out of the warehouse
to his car
he opens the trunk pulls out a large can of gasoline
he walks back inside the warehouse
carrying the can of gas
blonde pours the gasoline all over the cop whos begging him not to do this
blonde just sings along with stealers wheel
blonde lights up a match and while mouthing clowns to the left of me jokers to the right
here i am stuck in the middle with you
he moves the match up to the cop
when a bullet explodes in mr
the handheld camera whips to the right and we see the bloody mr
orange firing his gun
we cut back and forth between mr
blonde taking bullet hits and mr
orange emptying his weapon
blonde falls down dead
orange crawls to where the cop is leaving a bloody trail behind him
when he reaches the cops feet he looks up at him
feebly whats your name
listen to me jeffrey andrews
im a cop
surprised you do
your names freddy something
frankie ferchetti introduced us once about five months ago
i dont remember that at all
pause how do i look
the gun shot mr
orange looks at the kids gashed face and the hole in the side of his head where his ear used to be
i dont know what to tell you jeffrey
jeffrey starts to weep
that fucking bastard
that fucking sick fucking bastard
jeffrey i need you to hold on
theres officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away
screaming what the fuck are they waiting for
that motherfucker cut off my ear
he slashed my face
and im dying
they dont know that
all they know is theyre not to make a move until joe cabot shows up
i was sent undercover to get cabot
you heard em they said hes on his way
dont pussy out on me now jeffrey
were just gonna sit here and bleed until joe cabot sticks his fuckin head through that door
a tough looking black man named holdaway who sports a malcom x beard a green chairman mao cap with a red star on it and a military flack jacket digs
into a denny bacon cheese and avocado burger
he sits in a booth all alone
hes waiting for somebody
as he waits he practically empties an entire bottle of ketchup on his french fries not by mistake either thats just how he likes it
we see mr
orange now known as freddy newendyke wearing a high school letterman jacket enter the coffee shop spot holdaway and head his way
holdaway sees freddy bop towards him with a wide ass alligator grin plastered across his face
camera dollies fast down aisle to medium shot of holdaway
we fear freddy off screen
say hello to a motherfucker whos inside
cabots doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team
this better not be some freddy joke
looking up at freddy whos standing at the table
it aint no joke im in there
im up his ass
holdaway just looks at his pupil for a moment then smiles
we see through the window of the restaurant freddy slide into the booth across from holdaway
freddys doing a lot of talking but we cant hear what theyre saying
we are frozen on a medium cu of holdaway listening to freddy
we hear restaurant noise and freddy off screen
nice guy eddie tells me joe wants to meet me
he says i should just hang around my apartment and wait for a phone call
well after waiting three goddamn days by the fuckin phone he calls me last night and says joes ready and hell pick me up in fifteen minutes
the freeze frame ends
holdaway comes suddenly up to speed and says woo all picked you up
from here to end we cut back and forth
when we got to the bar
the boots and socks in gardena
when we got there i met joe and a guy named mr
its a phony name
my names mr
you ever seen this motherfucker before
no he aint familiar
he aint one of cabots soldiers either
hes gotta be from outta town
but joe knows him real well
how can you tell
the way they talk to each other
you can tell theyre buddies
did the two of you talk
me and mr
the milwaukee brewers
they had just won the night before and he made a killing off em
well if this crooks a brewers fan his ass has gotta be from wisconsin
and ill bet you everything from a diddle eyed joe to a damned if i know that in milwaukee they got a sheet on this mr
white motherfuckers ass
i want you to go through the mugs of guys from old milwaukee with a history of armed robbery and put a name to that face
holdaway takes a big bite out of his burger
with his mouth full what kinds questions did cabot ask
where i was from who i knew how i knew nice guy had i done time shit like that
holdaways talked enough hes eating his burger now
he motions for freddy to elaborate
he asked me if i ever done armed robbery before
i read him my credits
i robbed a few gas and sips sold some weed told him recently i held the shotgun while me and another guy pulled down a poker game in portland
camera moves from a medium on freddy to a cu
didja use the commode story
i tell it real good too
freddy and holdaway at one of their many rendezvous
holdaway wears an extra large lakers sweatshirt
freddy sits on one of the sinks wearing his high school jacket looking at pieces of paper stapled together
its a scene
a undercover cop has got to be marlon brando
to do this job you got to be a great actor
you got to be naturalistic
you got to be naturalistic as hell
if you aint a great actor youre a bad actor and bad acting is bull shit in this job
referring to the papers but what is this
its a amusing anecdote about a drug deal
something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job
i gotta memorize all this shit
its like a joke
you remember whats important and the rest you make your own
the only way to make it your own is to keep sayin it and sayin it and sayin it and sayin it and sayin it
i can do that
the things you gotta remember are the details
its the details that sell your story
now this story takes place in this mens room
so you gotta know the details about this mens room
you gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands
you gotta know the stalls aint got no doors
you gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap whether they got hot water or not cause if you do your job when you tell your story everybody should
and if you tell your story to somebody whos actually taken a piss in this mens room and you get one detail they remember right theyll swear by you
freddy paces back and forth in and out of frame rehearsing the anecdote
hes reading it pretty good but hes still reading it from the page and every once in a while he stumbles over his words
this was during the los angeles marijuana drought of
i still had a connection
which was insane cause you couldnt get weed anyfuckinwhere then
anyway i had a connection with this hippie chick up in santa cruz
all and my friends knew it
and theyd give me a call and say hey freddy you buyin some you think you could buy me some too
they knew i smoked so theyd ask me to buy a little for them when i was buyin
but it got to be everytime i bought some weed i was buyin for four or five different people
finally i said fuck this shit
im makin this bitch rich
she didnt have to do jack shit she never even had to meet these people
i was fuckin doin all the work
so i got together with her and told her hey im sick of this shit
im comin through for everybody and nobodys comin through for me
so either im gonna tell all my friends to find their own source or you give me a bunch of weed ill sell it to them give you the money
minus ten percent and i get my pot for free
so i did if for awhile
freddy exits frame another empty frame except obviously outside
freddy enters frame from the same direction he exited in the previous scene finishing his sentence
when we move to a wider shot we see freddy performing his monolog to holdaway in a parking lot
holdaway sits on the hood of his beat up car
freddy paces back and forth as he performs his story
but then that got to be a pain in the ass
people called me on the phone all the fuckin time
i couldnt rent a fuckin tape without six phone calls interrupting me
hey freddy whens the next time youre gettin some
motherfucker im tryin to watch lost boys when i have some ill let you know
and then these rinky dink pot heads come by theres my friends and everything but still
i got all my shit laid out in sixty dollar bags
well they dont want sixty dollars worth
they want ten dollars worth
breaking it up is a major fuckin pain in the ass
i dont even know how much ten dollars worth is
well fuck man i dont want that much around
if i have that much around ill smoke it
hey if you guys cant control your smokin thats not my problem
you motherfuckers been smokin for five years be a adult about it
finally i just told my connection count me out
but as it turns out im the best guy she had and she depended alot on my business
but i was still sick to death of it
and shes trying to talk me into not quitin
now this was a very weird situation cause i dont know if you remember back in there was a major fuckin drought
nobody and anything
people were livin on resin and smokin the wood in their pipes for months
and this chick had a bunch and was beggin me to sell it
so i told her i wasnt gonna be joe the pot man anymore
but i would take a little bit and sell it to my close close close friends
she agreed to that and said wed keep the same arrangement as before ten percent and free pot for me as long as i helped her out that weekend
she had a brick of weed she was sellin and she didnt want to go to the buy alone
freddy joe nice guy eddie and mr
white all sit around a table in a red lighted smokey bar
freddy continues his story
the crooks are enjoying the hell out of it
her brother usually goes with her but hes in county unexpectedly
traffic tickets gone to warrant
they stopped him for something found the warrants on im took im to jail
she doesnt want to walk around alone with all that weed
well i dont wanna do this i have a bad feeling about it but she keeps askin me keeps askin me finally i said okay cause im sick of listening
well were picking this guy up at the train station
youre picking the buyer up at the train station
youre carrying the weed on you
yeah the guy needed it right away
dont ask me why
so we get to the train station and were waitin for the guy
now im carrying the weed in one of those carry on bags and i gotta take a piss
so i tell the connection ill be right back im goin to the little boys room
he walks through the door with a carry on bag over his shoulder
once hes inside he stops in his tracks
we move into a cu
so i walk into the mens room and whos standing there
on freddy standing in front of six los angeles county sheriffs and one german shepherd
all of their eyes are on freddy
everyone is frozen
six los angeles county sheriffs and a german shepherd
they were waiting for you
they were just a bunch of cops hangin out in the mens room talkin
when i walked through the door they all stopped what they were talking about and looked at me
thats hard man
thats a fuckin hard situation
barking his head off
the german shepherd starts barkin
hes barkin at me
i mean its obvious hes barkin at me
we do a slow around freddy in the mens room
we can hear the dog barking
every nerve ending all of my senses the blood in my veins everything i has was screaming take off man just take off get the fuck outta there
panic hit me like a bucket of water
first there was the shock of it bam right in the face
then im just standin there drenched in panic
camera does a pan from face to face of the sheriffs
and all those sheriffs are lookin at me and they know
they can smell it
as sure as that fuckin dog cam they can smell it on me
back to the same freeze frame shot of freddy standing in front of the sheriffs
it suddenly jerks to life and moves to speed
the dog is barking
freddy moves to his right out of frame
we stay on the sheriffs
one sheriff yells at the dog
the dog quiets down
sheriff continues with his story
a couple of the sheriffs look over at freddy off screen but as sheriff talks turn their attention to him
so my guns drawn right
i got it aimed right at him
i tell em freeze dont fuckin move
and the little idiots lookin at me nodding his head yes sayin i know
meanwhile his right hand is creepin towards his glove box
so i scream at him asshole you better fuckin freeze right now
and hes still lookin right at me saying i know
and his right hands still going for the glove box
the camera pans away from the sheriffs to freddy up against the urinal playing possum pretending to piss
i tell im buddy im gonna shoot you in the face right now if you dont put your hands on the fuckin dash
and the guys girlfriend a real sexy oriental bitch starts screamin at him chuck are you out of your mind
put your hands on the dash like the officer said
and then like nothing the guy snaps out of it and casually puts his hands on the dash
freddy finishes his playing possum piss and walks past the sheriffs over to the sink
the camera pans with him
a sheriff is sitting on a sink
he looks down and watches freddy wash his hands
what was he goin for
stupid fuckin citizen doesnt have the slightest idea how close he came to gettin shot
freddy finishes washing his hands
he goes to dry them but theres only those hand drying machines
freddy turns on the drying machine
he cant hear anything the sheriffs say now
the sound of the machine dominates the sound track
these following shots are slow motion
cu of his hands rubbing each other getting blown dry shot of sheriffs talking
we cant hear them because of the machine
medium of sheriff on sink smoking a cigarette glancing over at freddy
machine turns off
thats him thats mr
an office upstairs in the undercover division of the police station
look at mug shot
lets see what we got on him
the name dimick lawrence is typed in
this is your life lawrence dimick
printing out sheet
the noise of the printer plays loud over the soundtrack
jodies hand comes into frame and tears sheet from the printer
holdaway sits behind his desk
freddy sits on the edge of the desk eating a double double with cheese
they look into the camera
we hear jodies voice offscreen
lawrence larry dimick
also known as lawrence jacobs and alvin al jacobs
this guy is mr
joe armed robbery
hes a pro and he makes it a habit not to get caught
dolly slowly into c
hes only been convicted twice which is pretty good for somebody living a life of crime
once for armed robbery when he was twenty one in milwaukee
what was it
payroll office at a lumber yard
first offense he got eighteen months
he didnt get busted again until he was thirty two
and then it was a backdoor bust
a routine vice squad roust
they roust this bar out buddy lawrence is in there knocking down a few
he gets picked up
hes wearing on his person an outlaw
automatic apparently his weapon of choice
also on his finger is a diamond ring from a jewelry store robbery a year earlier
he got two years back inside for that
goddamn thats hard time
so far its the only time hes ever done
was this vice squad bullshit in milwaukee
the vice squad roust was in l
hes been in los angeles since
from left to right
when did he do this time
back in got out late
i found something else out i think you two should be aware of
about a year and a half ago up in sacramento an undercover cop john dolenz worked his way into a bank job
apparently before the job they found out he was a cop
now picture this its dolenzs birthday a bunch of cops are waiting in his apartment for a surprise party
the door opens everyone yells surprise
and standing in the doorway is dolenz and this other guy sticking a gun in dolenzs ribs
before anybody knows whats going on this stranger shoots dolenz dead and starts firing two
automatics into the crowd
the dolly moves behind jodie
it was a mess
cops got hit wives got hit girlfriends got hit his dog got hit
people got glass in their faces
three were killed six were wounded
they couldnt pin the killing on one of the bank robbers
they tried but they didnt have a positive i
and all those guys had alibis
besides we really didnt have anything on them
we had the testimony of a dead man that they were talking about committing a robbery
they never went ahead with the bank job
the dolly completes its circle
and larry dimick was one of the boys
he was probably the one
just how sure are you with your cover
pan to c
today they may know something tomorrow they may know something else
but yesterday they didnt know anything
whats the next step
do what they told ya
sit in your apartment and wait for em to call you
well have guys posted outside wholl follow you when they pick you up
freddy answers it we follow the receiver up to his face
through phone its time
grab your jacket c
of nice guy eddie speaking into the car phone
were parked outside
through phone ill be right down
we hear the click of freddy hanging up through the phone
nice guy places the receiver back in its cradle
hell be right down
the camera follows freddy as he hops around the apartment getting everything he needs
he puts on his jacket and slips on some sneakers
dolly fast toward the front door knob
freddys hand comes into frame grabs the knob then lets go
we move up to his face
to himself dont pussy out on me now
they dont know
they dont know shit
pause youre not gonna get hurt
youre fucking baretta and they believe every word cuz youre super cool
he exits frame
we stay put and hear the door open and close off screen
from inside an unmarked car across the street the two cops watching freddy see him walk out of his building and up to eddies parked car
there goes our boy
i swear a guy has to have rocks in his head the size of gibraltar to work undercover
do you want one of these
yeah gimme the bear claw
freddy gets into the car and it pulls into traffic
cop starts the engine and follows
nice guy eddie is behind the wheel
pink is in the passenger seat
freddy and mr
white are in the backseat together
hey i know what im talkin about black women aint the same as white women
sarcastically theres a slight difference
the car laughs
go ahead and laugh you know what i mean
what a while bitch will put up with a black bitch wont put up with for a minute
they got a line and if you cross it they fuck you up
i gotta go along with mr
pink on this
ive seen it happen
if this is such a truism how come every nigger i know treats his woman like a piece of shit
ill make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin their ass in public when their bitches get em home they chill the fuck out
not these guys
yeah those guys too
let me tell you guys a story
in one of daddys clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named elois
e and lois

she was from ladora heights
the black beverly hills
i knew this lady from ladora heights once
in a stuck up black female voice hi im from ladora heights its the black beverly hills
its not the black beverly hills its the black palos verdes
anyway this chick elois was a man eater upper
i bet every guy whos ever met her has jacked off to her at least once
you know who she looked like
member that tv show get christie love
she was a black female cop
she always used to say youre under arrest sugar
i was in the sixth grade when that show was on
i totally dug it
what the fuck was the name of the chick who played christie love
no it wasnt pan grier pan grier was the other one
pan grier made the movies
christie love was like a pam grier tv show without pam grier
what the fuck was that chicks name
oh this is just great im totally fuckin tortured now
well whoever she was elois looked like her
so one night i walk into the club and no elois
now the bartender was a wetback he was a friend of mine his name was carlos
so i asked him hey carlos wheres lady e tonight
well apparently lady e was married to this real piece of dog shit
i mean a real animal
and apparently he would so things to her
what would he do
you mean like beat her up
nobody knows for sure what he did
we just know he did something
anyway elois plays it real cool
and waits for the next time this bag of shit gets drunk
so one night the guy gets drunk and passes out on the couch
so while the guys inebriated she strips him naked
then she takes some crazy glue and glues his dick to his belly
the car reacts to how horrible that would be
im dead fuckin serious
she put some on his dick and some on his belly then stuck em together
the paramedics had to come and cut it loose
the car reacts badly
you can do some crazy things with it
i dont know what he did to her but she got even
was he all pissed off
how would you feel if you had to do a handstand every time you took a piss
the car laughs
nice guy eddie pulls up outside the warehouse
the four men climb out of the car and follow eddie inside
the four men enter the building
at the other end of the warehouse sitting in chairs are mr
blue and joe cabot
we shoot this from overhead looking down on the men
to everybody so theyre talkin about how they get their wives off and the french guys says in a bad french accent all i gotta do is take my pinky
and tickle my fifis little oo la la and she rises a foot off the bed
back to joe
so the dago says in a good brooklyn accent thats nothin
when i take the tip of my tongue and wiggle it against my mary louises little fun pimple she rises two feet off da bed
then our friend from poland says in dumb voice you guys aint no cocksmen
when i get through fuckin my sophie i wipe my dick on the curtains and you know what
she hits the roof
joe laughs like a crazy man
ha ha ha ha ha ha
we hear a lot of laughing off screen
aint that a masterpiece
stupid fuckin polack wipes his dick on the drapes
joes eyes greet the new arrivals
youre here great
joe exits c
we now have everybody from the uncle bobs pancake house scene together again
some sit on folding chairs some stand
joe sits in front of them on the edge of a table
a blackboard with a layout of the jewelry store is off to the right
we do a around the men
we woulda gotten here sooner but we got backed up around la brea and pico
to the boys all right lets get to know one another
with the exception of eddie and myself who you already know youll be using aliases
under no circumstances are you to tell one another your real name or anything else about yourself
that includes where youre from your wifes name where you mightve done time about a bank in st
petersburg you mightve robbed
you guys dont say shit about who you are where you been or what youve done
only thing you guys can talk about is what youre going to do
this way the only ones who know who the members of the team are are eddie and myself
and thats the way i like it
because in the unlikely event of one of you getting apprehended by the cops not that i expect that to happen it most definitely should not happen it hasnt happened
you dont have anything to deal with
you dont know any names
you know my name you know eddies name
that i dont care about
you gotta prove it
i aint worried
besides this way you gotta trust me
i like that
i set this up and picked the men i wanted for it
none of you came to me i approached all of you
i know you
i know your work i know your reputation
i know you as men
except for this guy
joe points a finger at freddy
freddy shits a brick
but hes ok
if he wasnt ok he wouldnt be here
okay let me introduce everybody to everybody
but once again at the risk of being redundant if i even think i hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their christian name
joe searches for the right words you wont want to be you
pointing at the men as he gives them a name mr
orange and mr
why am i mr
cause youre a faggot
why cant we pick out our own colors
i tried that once it dont work
you get four guys fighting over whos gonna be mr
since nobody knows anybody else nobody wants to back down
so forget it i pick
be thankful youre not mr
yeah but mr
thats too close to mr
pink sounds like mr
tell you what let me be mr
that sounds good to me im mr
youre not mr
purple somebody from another jobs mr
who cares what your name is
who cares if youre mr
oh thats really easy for you to say youre mr
you gotta cool sounding name
so tell me mr
white if you think mr
pink is no big deal you wanna trade
nobodys trading with anybody
look this aint a goddamn fuckin city counsel meeting
listen up mr
we got two ways here my way or the highway
and you can go down either of em
so whats it gonna be mr
jesus christ joe
fuckin forget it
this is beneath me
pink lets move on
camera leaves the team and goes to the blackboard with the layout of the jewelry store on it
okay fellas lets get into this
freddy and holdaway sit on some bleachers in an empty little league baseball field
okay were gonna station men across the street from karinas fine jewelry
but their orders will be not to move in unless the robbery gets out of control
you gotta make sure they dont have to move in
youre inside to make sure that everything goes according to hoyle
we have men set up a block away from the warehouse rendezvous
they got complete visibility of the exterior
so as soon as joe cabot shows up well see it
whats your visibility of the interior
we cant see shit on the inside
and we cant risk gettin any closer for fear theyll spot us
this is bullshit jim
i get all the fuckin danger of having you guys in my back pocket but none of the safety
whats the matter newendyke
job too tough for ya
no one lied to you
you always knew wed hang back until joe cabot showed up
oh this is great
you aint giving me no fuckin protection whatsoever
but you are giving me an attitude
since when does an undercover cop have protection
freddy you came into this thing with your eyes wide open so dont start screamin blind man now
i understand youre nervous
i wish the warehouse had more visible windows but it doesnt
we have to make do with the cards were dealt
i didnt say i wasnt gonna do it
im just remarking on how shitty the situation is
i dont mean to be harsh with ya but ive found tough love works best in these situations
we have to get joe cabot in the company of the thieves and in the same vicinity as the loot
we dont care about these other bastards
were willing to offer them good deals to testify against cabot
isnt this risk unorthodox
letting them go ahead with the robbery
the whole idea behind this operation is to catch joe cabot red handed
we bust these hired hands we aint accomplished shit
letting them go through with the heist is a risk but cabots jobs are very clean
we got people surrounding the perimeter
we got a guy and a gal on the inside posing as a couple shopping for rings
we could replace the employees with cops but wed run the risk of tipping em off
they know the faces of who works what shift
these guys are professionals
its a risk but i think its a calculated risk
we see mos shots of the outside of the jewelry store
customers coming and going
store clerks waiting on customers through the windows
while we look at this we hear over the soundtrack mr
white and freddy talking off screen
lets go over it
where are you
i stand outside and guard the door
i dont let anybody come in or go out
brown stays in the car
hes parked across the street till i give him the signal then he pulls up in front of the store
blonde and mr
they handle customers and employees in the display area
white and freddy sit in a car parked across the street from the jewelry store staking it out
myself and mr
you two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds
were there for those stones period
since no display cases are being fucked with no alarms should go off
were out of there in two minutes not one second longer
what if the manager wont give up the diamonds
when youre dealing with a store like this theyre insured up the ass
theyre not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever
if you get a customer or an employee who thinks hes charles bronson take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in
drops em right to the floor
everyone jumps he falls down screaming blood squirts out his nose
freaks everybody out
nobody says fuckin shit after that
you might get some bitch talk shit to ya
but give her a look like youre gonna smash her in the face next
watch her shut the fuck up
now if its a manager thats a different story
the managers know better than to fuck around
so if ones givin you static he probably thinks hes a real cowboy
so what you gotta do is break that son of a bitch in two
if you wanna know something and he wont tell you cut off one of his fingers
the little one
then you tell im his thumbs next
after that hell tell ya if he wears ladies underwear
im hungry lets get a taco
its the moment of the robbery
the alley is empty
in the distance we hear all hell breaking loose
guns firing people shouting and screaming sirens wailing glass breaking
a car whips around the corner into the alley
the doors burst open freddy and mr
white hop out
freddy opens the drivers side door
a bloody screaming mr
brown falls out
screaming my eyes
im blind im fucking blind
youre not blind theres just blood in your eyes
white loads his two
he runs to the end of the alley just as a police car comes into sight
white massacres everyone in the patrol car
freddy holding the dying mr
brown looks on at mr
whites ambush in shock
brown lifts his head up blood in his eyes
orange arent you
by the time freddy turns his head back to him mr
brown is dead
white runs up to freddy
is he dead
freddy doesnt answer he cant
did he did or not
snap out of it
white grabs freddy by the coat and yanks him along as he runs
they exit the alley and flee down a street
a car with a female driver comes up on the two men
white jumps in her path stopping the car
he points his jun at her
get us outta here
white climbs into the backseat
freddy starts to climb in
the female driver comes up with a gun from under her seat
the bitchs got a gun
she shoots freddy in the stomach
on instinct freddy brings up his gun and shoots her in the face
as he falls to the ground he realizes whats happened to him and what hes done
mr white drags the dead female driver out of the car
he shoves freddy in the backseat and drives away
freddy holding his stomach and doubled over in pain is we replay the scene between freddy and mr
white in the getaway car
except this time we never leave freddy
just hold on buddy boy
i cant believe she killed me
pink is behind the wheel nice guy eddie is in the passenger seat going through the satchel with the diamonds
white is in the backseat
the car is speeding back to the garage
looking through the case you know all things considered this was pretty successful
i dont believe you just said that
no it was messy as hell but do you realize how much you got away with
theres over two million dollars worth of diamonds here
i love this guy
hey whats done is done
we can all sit around and have a big cry about it or we can deal with the situation at hand
the situation as hand isnt that fuckin satchel
you and joe have a responsibility to your men
hey its the best i could do
the man is fucking dying
and im telling you bonniell take care of him
he needs a doctor not a fuckin nurse
ask me how many doctors i called
you wanna embarrass yourself ask me how many doctors i called
obviously not enough
you gotta little black book then whip is out
if not listen how it is
i called three doctors and couldnt get through to shit
now time being a factor i called bonnie
sweet broad helluva broad and a registered nurse
told her a bullshit story upside she said bring him to her apartment
if he dies im holding you personally responsible
fuck you buddy boy
okay you wanna play that way
i am personally leaving myself vulnerable with this bonnie situation
i dont think shell call the cops but i dont know for sure
but me being too nice a fuckin guy was willin to risk it
but no fuckin more
he grabs his portable phone im callin bonnie back and tellin her to forget it
you take care of your friend you know so much about it
goddamnit will you guys grow up
i dont need to grow up my friend
i am a grown up
im being responsible im taking care of business
cut the shit
i dont think you called anybody except some cooze you once fucked who happens to wear orthopedic shoes
and i dont think thats good enough care for a gut shot man
yeah well i dont give a flying fuck what you think
white look hes not sayin this bitch is gonna operate on him
shes gonna give him better attention than we can until we can get a doctor
nobodys forgotten about doctors
joell get one in a snap
this is something were doing in the meantime
i think both of you are actin like a couple of assholes
i arrange a nurse i leave myself wide open and im an asshole
medium shot on the door
nice guy eddie mr
white and mr
pink walk through it
they stop in their tracks
we see what they see
blonde lying on the ground shot full of holes
the cop slumped over in his chair a bloody mess mr
orange lying at the cops feet holding his wound
white and mr
pink walk into the shot
what the fuck happened here
eddie runs over to his friend mr
blonde toothpick vic
orange what happened
very weakly blonde went crazy
he slashed the cops face cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive
yelling who cares what he was gonna do to this fuckin pig
eddie whips out his gun and shoots the cop
the cop and the chair tip over
eddie stands over him and shoots him once more
orange you were saying he went crazy
something like that
worse or better
look eddie he was pullin a burn
he was gonna kill the cop and me
and when you guys walked through the door he was gonna blow you to hell and make off with the diamonds
to eddie uhuh uhuh whats i tell ya
that sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho
to eddie you couldve asked the cop if you didnt just kill him
he talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up
i dont buy it
it doesnt make sense
it makes perfect fuckin sense to me
eddie you didnt see how he acted during the job we did
pink walks over to the cops body
hes right about the ear its hacked off
orange let me say this out loud just to get it straight in my mind
according to you mr
blonde was gonna kill you
then when we came back kill us grab the diamonds and scram
thats your story
im correct about that right
eddie you can believe me or not believe me but its the truth
i swear on my mothers eternal soul thats what happened
the camera mover into a c
of nice guy eddie
theres a long pause while he rolls over what mr
orange has said
finally youre a fuckin liar
now why dont you drop the fuckin fairy tale and tell me what really happened
he told you what really happened
you just cant deal with it
okay youre right im lying
even though im fuckin dyin im not above pullin a fast one
get rid of blonde we share his split no scratch that i shot him cause i didnt like his hair style
i didnt like his shoes either
if it has just been his hair idve maybe maybe i said let him live
but hair and footwear together hes a goner
the man you killed was just released from prison
he got caught at a company warehouse full of hot items
he couldve walked away
all he had to do was say my dads name
but instead he shut his mouth and did his time
he did four years for us and he did em like a man
and we were very grateful
orange youre tellin me this very good friend of mine who did four years for my father who in four years never made a deal no matter what they dangled
in front of him youre telling me that now that now this man is free and were making good on our commitment to him hes just gonna decide right out of the fuckin blue to rip us off
orange why dont you tell me what really happened
itll just be more bullshit
eddie steps out of his c
and we see joe cabot standing in the warehouse doorway
he walks into the room
pointing to mr
orange this man set us up
camera does a around the men
daddy im sorry i dont know whats happening
thats okay eddie i do
to joe what the fuck are you talking about
pointing to mr
orange that piece of shit
workin with the cops
i said this lump of shit is workin with the lapd
looking up from the floor at everybody
joe looks down at mr
i dont have the slightest fuckin idea what youre talkin about
very calmly to joe joe i dont know what you think you know but youre wrong
like hell i am
very calmly joe trust me on this youve made a mistake
hes a good kid
i understand youre hot youre super fuckin pissed
were all real emotional
but youre barking up the wrong tree
i know this man and he wouldnt do that
you dont know jack shit
this rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got mr
brown and mr
dead as dillinger
the motherfucker killed vic
how do you know all this
he was the only one i wasnt a hundred percent on
i should have my fucking head examined for goin forward when i wasnt a hundred percent
but he seemed like a good kid and i was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up
screaming thats your proof
you dont need proof when you got instinct
i ignored it before but not no more
he whips out a revolver and aims it at mr
white brings his
up at joe
eddie and mr
pink are shook awake by the flash of firearms
eddie raises his gun pointing it at mr
have you lost your fucking mind
put your gun down
pink fades into the b
wanting no part of this
joe youre making a terrible mistake i cant let you make
stop pointing your fuckin gun at daddy
joe never taking his eyes off mr
dont worry eddie
me and larry have been friends a long time he aint gonna shoot
we like each other too much
joe if you kill that man you die next
repeat if you kill that man you die next
we get many different angles of the mexican standoff
orange holding his belly looking from left to right
joe pointing down on mr
not taking his eyes off him
white pointing at joe looking like hes ready to start firing any minute
eddie scared shitless for his father gun locked on mr
pink walking backwards away from the action
nobody says nothing
of guys ready for violence
pink in the b
cmon guys nobody wants this
were supposed to me fuckin professionals
joe raises his head to mr
larry im gonna kill him
goddamn you joe dont make me do this
larry im askin you to trust me on this
dont ask me that
im not askin im betting
joes eyes go back to mr
joe fires three times hitting mr
orange with every one
white shoots joe twice in the face
joe brings his hands up to his face screaming and falls to the ground
eddie fires at mr
white hitting him three times in the chest
white brings his gun around on eddie and shoots him
the two men fall to their knees firing at each other
eddie collapses dead
orange lies perfectly still except for his chest heaving
the only sound we hear is his loud breathing
white is shot full of holes but still on his knees not moving
pink is standing motionless
finally he grabs the satchel of diamonds and runs out the door
we hear outside a car start
then the sound of a bullhorn yells out freeze
get out of the car and lie face down on the ground
we now hear sirens the sounds of more cars driving up men running to the warehouse
while all this noise is going on mr
white tries to stand but falls down
he somehow makes it to where mr
he lifts mr
oranges head cradling it in his lap and stroking his brow
with much effort sorry kid
looks like were gonna do a little time
orange looks up at him and with even more of an effort im a cop
white doesnt say anything he keeps stroking oranges brow
im sorry im so sorry
white lifts his
and places the barrel between mr
the camera moves into an extreme c
of mr white
the sounds of outside storm inside
we dont see anything but we hear a bunch of shotguns cocking
drop your fucking gun
mr white looks up at them smiles pulls the trigger
we hear a burst of shotgun fire
white is blown out of frame leaving it empty
