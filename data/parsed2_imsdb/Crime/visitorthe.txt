written by tom mccarthy walter vale sixty two is standing by the window of his modestly furnished colonial house
he is holding a glass of wine and peering out through the drapes
after a few moments an old car pulls up
a slightly overweight woman gets out of the car
she starts to walk up to the house
walter steps back from the window and waits
the doorbell rings
walter takes a last sip of wine and sets the glass down on the end table
and then he goes to the door and opens it
im barbra watson
nice to meet you
she steps into the house and walter shuts the door
they both stand there awkwardly
barbara is tightly wound and overcompensates with a forced pleasantness
can i take your coat
no thank you
would you like anything to drink
beat shall we get started
walter and barbara sit side by side in a very close proximity
lets try it again
the same thing
remember fingers curved
like a tunnel
walter starts to play the piano
its a lesson in progress
they are sitting at a beautiful grand piano but walter is only a beginner
and not a very good beginner
walter keeps playing
make room for the train
i said make room for the train
its something that i tell my kids
if you curve your fingers like this
she demonstrates then the train can pass through the tunnel
she passes her pencil through her curved fingers
walter looks at her for a long moment
walter walks barbara to the front door
he opens it and then hands barbara some money
next tuesday at the same time
i dont think im going to continue with our lessons
are you giving up
barbara gets the point
he is stopping with her not the lessons
barbara walks out the door and then turns before walter shuts it
if i may ask how many teachers have you had before me
well for what its worth its difficult to learn an instrument at your age
especially if you dont possess a natural gift for it
im not saying this to be mean
but if you do decide to give up then i would really like to buy your piano
its a beautiful instrument
walter nods not quite sure how to receive the comment
barbara turns and leaves
walter shuts the door
walter stands before a half empty class
he is wrapping up a lecture on economic theory
there is nothing inspiring about it
east asias experience is really the exception to the rule because the conditions there that made trade liberalization for the middle east successful werent present in the developing countries in
sub saharan africa and in central and south america
walter walks across the campus
walter sits in a meeting with seven other colleagues
walter is staring out the window in his simple but very lived in office
classical music plays softly in the background
a knock at the door
a student opens the door and enters
he sits down and sets a paper on the desk
sorry its late
why is it late
i had some personal things to deal with
walter hands back the paper
i cant accept it now
walter goes back to work
the student sits stunned for a moment and then gets up and picks up his paper
he opens the door and then stops
you know you still havent given us a syllabus
lying i know
the student shakes his head and leaves without another word
walter pulls into the driveway of his house
he gets out grabs his belongings out of the back seat and walks inside
walter is making dinner
classical music plays from the other room
he adjusts the flame and covers a sauce pot
he leans against the counter and picks up a half empty bottle of wine and pours some into his glass
he catches sight of a small framed picture of him and his wife smiling
walter sits at the piano and practices
it is still going badly
the wine glass sits on top of the piano
he lifts his hand and inspects his tunnel
walter is at his computer
he pulls up his year syllabus on the computer and carefully changes to
he saves it
his work is done
there is a knock at the door
the door opens and walters colleague charles van horn steps in
im sorry to interrupt
walter shelley cant make it down to the nyu conference to present your paper
im going to need you to cover for her
why cant she go
shes been put on bed rest until she has the baby
walter is caught off guard
well cover your class and make the arrangements
i wish i could but now is not a very good time charles
i understand but you co authored the paper and the dean wants it presented
he wants to keep shelley on track for tenure
i just dont think i can with the start of classes and my book
youre only teaching one class walter
so i can stay focused on my writing
id really rather not go right now
im sorry but there really isnt another option at this point
walter is trapped
he comes clean
charles the truth is this is really shelleys paper
i just agreed to co author it because she asked me to
im not really prepared to present it
that may be the case but you are the co author and she cant go
look walter you can take it up with the dean if you want but as your friend i wouldnt advise it
not with that argument
walter just stares him
and charles is gone shutting the door behind him
walter sits at the end of a bar at a local pub
he is reading the newspaper
karen a year old bartender is talking to a blonde haired woman at other end of the bar
the wall is covered with hand drawn caricatures of regular patrons
a waiter hands a plate of food to karen
she walks down the bar and sets it in front of walter
here you go cutey
so i thought you forgot about me
whereve you been hiding
karen automatically refills his wine glass
just busy with work
well youre never gonna make it on the wall with that excuse
im glad your back
give a holler if you need anything
im just gabbing with one of my girlfriends
she walks back down the bar
walter starts to eat
two cars are parked in walters driveway
walter is packing laying out his shirts on the bed
after a moment karen walks in drying her hair with a towel
when are you going
today after class
she takes her earrings of the night stand and puts them in
sounds like fun
im gonna go have a cigarette
you want some coffee
walter keeps packing
walter sits at a table and eats lunch alone
walter walks across the parking lot and gets into his car
walter drives along the highway
he notices a sign which reads support our troops
walters car drives down the f
walter drives through the small busy streets of the east village
walter pulls into a parking garage
he gets out and takes a ticket from the attendant
he grabs his bag and briefcase from the back seat
he walks down the street taking in the sights and sounds of the city
walter walks out of a liquor store with a small brown bag
walter arrives at a classic tenement building
he looks up at the building as if inspecting it
he takes out his keys
he opens the door and walks in
walter walks into the well lit but dingy foyer
a young man brushes by him
he arrives at the second floor and stops in front of a door
he unlocks the door and walks in
walter steps into the apartment and drops his bags
he immediately notices that the kitchen light is on
something is not right
he turns on the living room light and crosses to the kitchen table and sets the brown bag down
its then that he notices some fresh flowers on the kitchen table
he looks slightly confused
he looks around the apartment
there is an upright piano along one wall
there is no answer
he walks down a long hallway and looks in the kitchen
he walks over to the first bedroom and looks inside
there are signs of someone living there
he looks in the second bedroom
he sees nothing
suddenly he hears the sound of running water from the bathroom
he notices a light under the door
he walks to the bathroom and listens
a faucet is turned and the water stops running
he opens the door and looks in
a young black woman is soaking in the bath tub
she sees walter and screams
walter screams too and then slams the door stepping back into the hallway
stay away from me
she has a west african accent
im not going
leave me alone
my boyfriend is coming home
im not going to hurt you
who are you
what are you doing in here
this is my apartment
what do you mean
this apartment does not belong to you
how did you get in
my name is walter vale
i have keys
suddenly walter is pushed up against the wall
what the fuck
a very angry young middle eastern man is in walters face
he grabs walter violently by the collar and shakes him
who are you
im in here
he is crazy
i am not
the young middle eastern man slams him against the wall
its more of a warning shot then a violent act
walter is terrified
in french tarek
what is happening
in french are you ok
in french im fine
in french who is this
in french i have no idea
i was in the bath and he was just standing there
shaking walter did you touch her
did you touch her
zainab opens the door
in french he didnt touch me
but how did he get in
he said he has keys
do you have keys
i have keys
its my apartment
tarek stares at walter trying to make sense of it
in french what does he mean its his apartment
i dont know
show me your keys
walter reaches into his pocket and holds up his keys
this is my apartment
ive owned it for twenty five years
so why havent you been here
i live in connecticut
i havent used it in a long time
walter is starting to get through
are you friends with ivan
who is ivan
tarek is getting nervous
in french i knew this would happen
he probably called the police
this catches tareks attention
to walter did you call the police
you didnt call the police
tarek looks like he might belt walter
instead he lets him go and quickly backs up
he paces while trying to gather his thoughts
walter doesnt move
zainab runs into the bedroom
and you dont know ivan
i dont know ivan
who is he
he rented us this place
he said it belonged to his friend who was out of town
i dont know who he is but this is my apartment
i assure you
tarek looks at walter for a long moment
its clear that hes telling the truth
in french i told you not to trust anyone
you never saw a contract
we dont want any trouble
we will get out of your apartment
this is all a mistake
we will leave ok
zainab emerges from the bedroom
she is dressed
in french where are we going to go
in french i dont know but we have to go
in french i know we have to go
i am not stupid
are you ok
im just going to sit down
walter nods and then slowly walks down the hallway and sits down
he is clearly shaken
tarek shuts the front door
im sorry if i hurt you
are you sure that youre ok
well well pack up and get out
tarek walks back toward the bedroom
walter tries to catch his breath
walter is sitting on the couch with a glass of wine
tarek enters and sets down a bag
he picks up two african drums next to the piano and places them by the front door
zainab enters from the bedroom mumbling something in an african dialect
she drops a bag and crosses back to the bedroom
i know im in trouble when she starts speaking wolof
how long have you lived here
we will pay you if you want
walter doesnt respond
zainab emerges from the bedroom again with the last bag
to zainab is that everything
i think so
do you want to check
he hands her a small plastic bag from a local grocery
here is the coffee you wanted
she snatches it without a word
to walter ok
so well go
i am sorry again
thank you for your understanding
they turn and exit
walter gets up and walks over to the front door and locks it
he stands by the front door trying to process the events
then something catches his attention
walter walks to the window and picks up a handcrafted decorative frame off of the sill
it is a photograph of tarek and zainab
they are hugging each other and smiling
walter looks down onto the street
he sees zainab and tarek exit the building and cross the street
zainabs cart tips on the curb and the contents spill out onto the sidewalk
tarek quickly moves to help her
zainab yells at him
walter watches as they finally collect their belongings and move down the street
tarek has set his bags down in front of a closed store
he is talking in a very agitated tone on his cell phone
zainab stands by silently
in arabic look i know
come on man itll just be for a night or two until we figure something out
in arabic can you check and call me back
walter is standing there holding the framed photograph
you left this at the apartment
tarek walks over and takes it
do you know where youre going to stay tonight
the lie is obvious
they are stuck
walter just nods again
walter takes some books out of his briefcase
he crosses to the bookshelf and sets them down
he notices a small stack of cds sitting on a shelf
he picks one of them up and stares at the cd for a long moment
you like classical music huh
walter sets down the cd
do you play piano
beat do you
i play the djembe
well thanks again for letting us stay
you saved me a lot of trouble
see you in the morning
tarek goes to bed
walter resumes his work
walter is lying in bed unable to sleep
he can hear tarek and zainab whispering and laughing
tarek and zainab are lying in bed together
stop it tarek
hell hear us
you dont know that
so let him hear
the guy probably needs some excitement
i think hes probably had enough for one night
tarek nuzzles her
zainab laughs but pushes him away
zainab sits up in the bed
tarek relents and rolls onto his back
what are we going to do tarek
i dont know
well figure it out tomorrow
maybe hell let us stay
hes not really using the place
i dont want to be his roommate
so well figure it out in the morning
i promise habibti
zainab shakes her head

zainab looks at him
zainab rolls over and straddles tarek
i dont love you
she kisses tarek
not even a little
she kisses him again
so what is this
she gets very close to his face
its your punishment
but what about our roommate
she kisses him long and hard
they start to make love
jacob walks outside with sprinkles
walter is tying his tie in the mirror
walter walks out of his bedroom and runs into zainab who is leaving her bedroom at the same time
its obvious that she was trying to avoid walter
i made some coffee

the kimmel center towers over washington square park
walter is listening to the speaker
that will be on the last day of conference

stephen kriegman strides to the podium
he is a good deal younger then walter

walter mingles at a reception
he is listening to another colleague tell a story
and so i just stood up and walked out
the group laughs
stephen kriegman approaches and talks to the colleague
stephen how are you
walter walks off
walter eats dinner in a large well appointed banquet room
walter listens as a chatty man talks
walter is walking up the stairs carrying a briefcase
he passes a middle aged man who is walking down the stairs with a small dog on a leash
walter stops and turns

walter nods and keeps walking
walter walks into the apartment
no one else is there
he sets down his case and walks toward his bedroom but stops at tarek and zainabs door which is closed
walter is reading over and rehearsing the paper that he has to present
sotto it is important to distinguish between both our current political assessment and our
it is important to distinguish between our current political assessment
he stops and crosses out the world both
he continues reading
walter is practicing the piano
he continues to struggle
he sits back and takes a break
he notices the drum next to the piano
he looks at it for long moment and then continues playing
walter is lying in bed awake
he listens as tarek and zainab come home
walter buys a newspaper
walter is back at the conference
he is listening to a presentation by a german economist
however we do find that financial globalization can be beneficial under the right circumstances
empirically good institutions and quality of governance are crucial in helping developing countries derive the benefits of globalization
walter checks his watch
he is obviously bored
walter is sitting in the park and eating some indian food from a local cart vendor
he finishes and drops it into the garbage can
he checks his watch and starts to head back toward the conference when a sound catches his attention
walter watches two young african american men drumming on buckets with reckless abandon
we should have them come play inside
three colleagues from the conference are standing next to him
in a minute
holding up his cell phone i have to make a call
see you inside
walter nods as the guys walk off
walter watches them go
he turns and watches the drumming again
walter arrives on the top floor
he can hear the drum being played
he stops in front of his apartment
he listens for a moment and then slowly opens the door
tarek is playing his drum in his t shirt and underwear
he sees walter and finishes with a flourish
tarek casually gets up and puts on his pants
youre home early
it was a half day
how was the conference
tarek buttons his pants
sorry about the pants
ive been playing like this since i was a kid
i think i might have a lead on a place in brooklyn
you can keep practicing if you like
it wont bother you
ill keep my pants on
hey zainabs going to make dinner if you want to eat with us later
walter walks into his bedroom
tarek watches him go and then starts playing again
walter is lying down on his bed reading through his paper
his foot is tapping to the rhythm of the drum
walter and zainab are sitting at the dinner table finishing their meal
tarek is on the phone in the living room speaking in arabic
he hangs up and rejoins the table
that was my mother
if i dont call her every day she thinks something happened to me
walter pours himself some wine
he offers some to tarek
ill have a bit
zainab shoots tarek a glance
walter misreads it
are you sure that you wouldnt like some
i dont drink
jokingly she is a good muslim
im a bad one
zainab gets up and starts to clear the table
are you finished
here let me
its the least i can do
her comment is more of an indictment than a pleasantry
well thank you for the dinner
it was very good
she leaves the room
so whats the conference about
economic growth in developing nations
so have you written some books
im working on my fourth
my father was a writer
is he still writing

zainab starts to put on her coat
tarek picks up his drum
walter you can come if you want
zainab shoots tarek a glance
i have to get some work done but thank you
well maybe another time bye
tarek and zainab leave
walter watches them go and then looks around the empty apartment
tarek and zainab are walking down the stairs
in french why did you invite him
in french were staying in his apartment
what could i do
in french well i would have been the one stuck sitting with him while you played your drum
tarek turns and looks at her very seriously
you know you are very sexy when youre mad at me
zainab cant help but smile
tarek starts to wrap his arms around her
tarek and zainab stop in their tracks already three flights down
they both look up the stairwell
walter is looking down on them
if you dont mind i think i will come
tarek and zainab share a quick look
walter disappears back into the apartment
zainab looks at tarek
tareks jazz trio is playing
walter and zainab sit at a small table in the back
walter is rapt
zainab is sketching
she looks up from her pad and watches him before returning to her drawing
walter and zainab are standing outside on the empty street
theres an awkward silence
hes very good
the whole band is very good
and then nothing
finally tarek emerges
they walk down the street
walter is sitting in the park and eating pizza
this time he is sitting directly across from the two african american drummers
walter walks into the apartment and sets down his briefcase
he notices tareks drum sitting in the middle of the room
no one answers
walter walks down the hallway a bit
walter walks back into the living room and takes off his coat
he removes some papers from his briefcase and then he notices the drum again
he sits down in the chair next to tareks drum
he takes the drum between his legs and he hits it a few times
then he starts to play
he stops and then he plays again
this time he is slightly more successful at finding a rhythm
he closes his eyes and bobs his head
hes really getting into it
he opens his eyes open and tarek is standing in front of him
he has headphones around his neck
it sounded good walter
walter immediately stands
i was just
im sorry if i
tarek walks over and grabs another chair from the kitchen table
dont be sorry
thats what its there for
tarek sets the chair down and grabs the other drum from beside the piano
i was lying on my bed listening to my music and then i was like whats the crazy rhythm im hearing
tarek sits down with the other drum facing walter
ill show you
walter hesitates and then sits down
just put your feet flat on the ground
walter adjusts his feet
now take the drum between your legs
tarek grabs the drums with his knees
now you want to lift the inside edge off the ground with your ankles
walter watches tarek and follows suit
now walter i know youre a very smart man but with the drum you have to remember not to think
thinking just screws it up
now just give it a couple of bangs
walter gives it a couple of hard bangs
not so hard
youre not angry at it
he bangs it a few more times
did you think
now one more thing walter
you listen to classical music so you think in fours
this is an african drum
so we are gonna play in threes
you have to forget your classical
leave it behind
tarek bangs out a simple bass beat
walter joins in
now keep going
walter loses the beat
tarek keeps playing
walter tries again
and then finally he gets it
there it is
now keep it going and i will do this
tarek riffs off of walters bass beat
keep it going
zainab is closing up her booth
another vendor walks by and says good bye
zainab smiles and nods good bye
zainab is walking home with her supplies
two new york police officers are talking to three young hispanic kids
zainab hesitates for the slightest moment before lowering her head and walking past
zainab enters the apartment and sees walter drumming
his shirt is unbuttoned exposing his white undershirt
he is breathing very hard and sweating
where is tarek
she places her items down on the kitchen table and takes off her coat
she looks around the apartment
he went out
to look at another apartment
she just looks at him with the drum
walter is still out of breath
are you ok
tarek is teaching me the drum
dont worry ill keep my pants on
zainab looks shocked
walters attempt at levity has fallen short
i was just
zainab nods and walks into the kitchen
tarek is playing with his band
walter is at the bar watching
he is unconsciously tapping along on the bar
tarek walter and darren the saxophone player sit at a table by the window eating
hey walter what time are you done tomorrow
i have to present a paper at eleven
i should be done by twelve thirty
to the waiter hey man could we get another order of this
to walter and tarek i love this food
because the chinese are taking over the world
thats not gonna happen
its already happening
one day our kids will be going to china for jobs
darren and tarek look at walter
you think thats true
walter is put on the spot
if china continues to threaten the wage earners in the first world economies by keeping wages down then its really just a matter of time
what they buy they inflate
what they sell they deflate
but then you have to ask the question whos paying the cost
and the answer is the chinese people
tarek continues eating
walter is presenting his paper
walter is walks out of the building talking to a female hey walter
walter and the female colleague turn
tarek is standing a few feet away holding both drums
walter nods and says good bye to the colleague who looks a bit confused
walter walks over to tarek
how did the presentation go
i found an apartment in brooklyn
we can move in on monday
its small but its a nice building
i just hope zainab likes it
i think she will as long as no else lives there
i think youre right

walter takes off his name tag and they start to walk
are you hungry

they walk across the park
walter and tarek are finishing lunch
tarek reaches into his bag and takes out a small bag
this is for you
for letting us stay
walter takes it and opens it
its a cd
its fela kuti
you know him
you dont know fela
walter you are in for a treat
he started the whole afro beat movement
and his drummer tony allen was just scary man
you want to play drums you have to listen to this
a handsome arab man walks past with a pretty blonde woman
tarek sees him and waves
in arabic hey tarek

they pick up their drums and leave
zainab is talking to two upper east side women who have stopped at her stall
i made it

i know my daughter will think its cool
she hands her the money
zainab takes it and drops it into a small pouch
where are you from
i was in cape town two winters ago

handing her the bag thank you very much
the woman walks away
a young israeli man zev is sitting at a nearby stall selling t shirts
how far is senegal from cape town
i told a guy i was from israel yesterday and he asked if i had ever visited the holy land
zev sees someone over zainabs shoulder
hey look who it is

tarek and walter are approaching

he kisses zainab
walter looks at the zainabs jewelry
her stuff is great right
she made me this
tarek holds up his wrist revealing a bracelet
you should make one for walter
zainab nods noncommittally
so walter and i are going up to the park to play for a little bit
tarek i told you we have to pick up my new table today
he said he would only hold it for today
you always say no problem and then you are late or you forget
i will not be long
well go up and play and then well come back to help you
i promise habibti
he kisses her and starts to walk away
its always habibti when you want your way
it closes at five p
not arab time tarek
not arab time
real time habibti
dont habibti me
they turn and start to leave
what does habibti mean
it means beloved one
does she know that
tarek and walter are waiting for the subway
a chinese musician is playing on the opposite platform
hes been playing here for a long time
is he good
i have no idea but its cool
i always wanted to play down here
its supposed to be good money
so why havent you
maybe some day we can do it together
split the profits
walter watches the chinese musician
walter and tarek stand in front of the drum circle in central park
what do you think
walter sizes it up and makes his assessment
i think ill just watch
come on walter
you just wait until you feel it
tarek joins the drum circle
walter is on the edge of the drum circle waiting to feel it
tarek is next to him playing away
tarek looks at walter and nods
finally walter starts to play
slowly at first but then he starts to really commit
tarek encourages him with a smile
tarek and walter are leaving the park
tarek checks his watch
shit we have to get home
zainab is gonna kill me
im on arab time again
what is arab time
it means im late by an hour
all arabs are late by an hour
we cant help it
tarek and walter hurry down the stairs of the subway station
walter and tarek approach the turnstile
they can hear the train arriving
thats our train
they pick up the pace
walter puts down his drum to take out his metrocard
tarek quickly picks it up
i got your drum
my card is empty
can you swipe me
walter swipes his card for tarek to pass through and then he swipes his own turnstile
walter passes through
tarek struggles a bit with both drums
he gets halfway through when the turnstile bar locks
you paid for the drum and not me
here take this
walter takes tareks drum and tarek quickly ducks under the turn style that walter just paid for
re the train i think we missed it
zainab is not going to be happy if
suddenly a man takes tarek by the arm
excuse me sir
could you please step over here
tarek reacts by pulling his arm away
what are you doing
could you please step over here
he reaches for tarek again who instinctively moves his arm again which agitates the cop
another cop enters into the action
just step over here pal
please what do you want
you jumped the turnstile
i did not jump it
it just didnt work
walter steps up
sir i did pay his fare
could you step back please
but i paid this mans
sir stand over there
to tarek can i see some id
tarek takes out his wallet
he shows them an id card
walter steps back to the wall and sets the two drums down
cop stands between him and the action
walter can barely make out what is being said
you got anything else tarek
where are you from
tarek is starting to panic
the two cops share a look
another train passes
cop asks tarek a few more questions which walter cannot hear
suddenly cop starts to handcuff tarek
what did i do
walter steps forward to intervene
i dont think thats necessary
well we do
you can come down to the station and make a statement
but he didnt mean
sir thats all im saying
now step back or we are gonna take you in too
where are you taking him
walter take the drum
tell zainab what happened but dont let her come for me
i will call you
the two cops lead tarek away
walter watches helplessly
dont let her come
i will call her
walter watches him go
walter enters and shuts the door and zainab is sitting on the couch working on her jewelry
she stops when she sees walter standing alone holding the two drums
where is tarek
he was arrested
in the subway
zainab immediately starts to panic
it was just a misunderstanding
they said he would be released later tonight
zainab really starts to lose it
her reaction is more than walter was prepared for
how could this happen
he knows better
he would not do anything wrong
im sure we it will be she begins to pack up her work
it wont be ok
yes it will
i went down to the precinct and made a statement
snapping at walter that doesnt matter
he is illegal
as am i
we are not citizens
do you know what that means
of course you dont
how could you
she picks up her things and walks down the hall to her room
walter sits stunned
walter is talking on his cell phone and pacing
his name is tarek khalil
i came down and made a statement
they said he would be released
that was six hours ago
well when should we know
walter hangs up
walter walks out of the police station
he crosses the street
zainab is standing there
theyve moved him
to a detention center in queens
he was turned over to immigration
they said we can see him during visiting hours tomorrow night from five to ten
zainab shakes her head
i cant visit him or i will end up in that place too
zainab fights to restrain her emotions
she turns and walks away
walter watches her go
zainabs bedroom light is on
zainab is sitting on her bed and talking on her phone
we are going tomorrow
the appointment is at eleven
i dont know he found him
i dont want to
i just dont tarek
ive already called him
i just want you to be here with me tarek
a sea of skyscrapers near one center street
zainab and walter exit an elevator and walk down the hall
walter and zainab talk to an mr
shah an indian immigration lawyer who is jotting down notes
he is clinical almost cold in his approach
zainab youre also undocumented right
you know you cant visit tarek at the detention center right
how long have you known tarek
almost a year
does tarek have any family living here
walter looks to zainab
his mother lives in michigan
this is news to walter
shes also undocumented correct
this is all confidential
yes she is
does she know that tarek is in custody
tarek told me not to tell her
he doesnt want to worry her
has he ever been convicted of a crime
he has had no trouble
he is a good person
do you know if they ever applied for asylum
walter looks at zainab
she is very uncomfortable
when he first arrived from syria
but he didnt get it
when was that
seven years ago
and did they appeal it
i dont know
shah jots something down
why wouldnt they appeal it
fear of being deported
it used to be that when your asylum case was denied they let you go until your appeal
a lot of people didnt bother with it
getting denied once was enough to spook them
so what happens if thats the case
then there may be a final order of deportation on him which means he wont even go before a judge this time
hell just be deported
they had to leave syria
they had no choice
this is also news to walter
look one step at a time
let me talk to him then well have a better idea of his status and what our options are
is there anything i can do
the lawyer slides a card across the table
walter takes it
walter rides the subway
he looks down at the lawyers card
walter emerges from the subway into a very industrial neighborhood
factories and fences
he checks his piece of paper and starts walking
walter is still walking
the area is very deserted
he stops and tries to locate a street address amongst the anonymous factories
he checks his sheet of paper and continues walking
walter is standing in front of the detention center
it looks like most of the other factories around it but perhaps with a bit more barbed wire
he presses a button and the automated door slowly opens
he walks inside
walter walks into a small brightly lit waiting room
a few soda machines and twelve blue plastic chairs
in one corner is a guard booth with three guards
one female guard is wearing a muslim headdress
walter approaches the window and waits in line
the other people waiting comprise a mix of nationalities african latin american chinese indian
the guard talks to a man in front of walter
the man has a slavic accent
that detainee has been moved
i dont know
he was here yesterday
but now hes not
thats all i know
you can call ice
the number is on the wall
sir step aside please
the slavic man reluctantly steps aside staring at a piece of paper
walter steps up to the window
he sets a piece of paper on the window sill
im here to see tarek khalil
the guard takes it
you been here before
can i see your license please
walter takes out his wallet
walter is let through a large metal door
there is an x ray machine immediately in front of him
walter empties his pockets and steps through
walter waits for the sliding metal door to open
it does and he steps into a small room
the door slides shut and he is alone in the small white room until a door on the other side slides open
he steps through and walks down a small hallway
on the left side of the hallway are small glassed in meeting rooms for lawyer consultations
walter enters into a large bright room
it resembles a prison visitation room
along the perimeter of the room is a clear fiberglass wall with twenty five small cubicles
each cubicle has one seat and a phone
on the other side of the fiberglass is another seat and a phone
walter looks around the room at the visitors and detainees
walter is still waiting
after a moment a door opens and tarek walks out wearing a blue jump suit
he sees walter and smiles
they each move toward the other and settle into a vacant seat
they both pick up the phone as they sit down
thank you for coming
how is zainab
i have a letter from her
you cant give it to me
it has to be sent to me by mail
but you can put it up to the glass
open it and place it up to the glass so i can read it
he sets down the phone so that he can press the letter up against the glass
tarek reads the letter
walter looks around the room trying to give tarek some privacy
he watches the various immigrant families speaking to one another
tarek taps the glass and points to walters phone
walter picks it up
thank you walter
walter nods as he folds up the envelope and places it back into his coat
how are they treating you
the place is very depressing
there is no privacy
the lights are always on
do you need anything
i just want to get out of here
zainab and i met with a lawyer today
what did he say
he is going to stop by to see you tomorrow
they both sit for a moment
unsure what to say next
finally walters curiosity gets the best of him
tarek zainab said you were denied asylum
you mean when we came here
did you go to your deportation hearing
we did everything they told us to
walter can only nod unsure of what else to say
hey could you tell darren
i didnt call him
a guard walks past and taps tarek on the shoulder and speaks to him
we cant hear what is being said
to walter i have to go
they have to do a bed count
usually i can visit for one hour
can you come tomorrow
and tell zainab i will call her as soon as i can
tarek gets up
goodbye my friend
tarek walks away
walter watches him go
walter and zainab are sitting at the kitchen table
zainab is holding her letter
did you ask him if he went to his hearing
he said that he did
zainab stands up
walter im going to leave now
i have a cousin in the bronx
i will stay with him for now
you dont have to leave
you can stay here
i think its best if i leave
when tarek calls me then i will tell him
you know how to reach me if you need to
is it ok if i leave tareks things here for now
my cousins place is not very big
zainab walks away from the apartment
walter drinks at the bar and watches tareks band play without tarek
walter practices the drum
jacob walks sprinkles in front of the apartment building
walter walks outside and waves hello as he walks past
darren and tarek are talking
walter sits and listens
walter eats alone
walter buys the morning paper from a kiosk
he walks to the corner and waits to cross the street
a large group of chinese tourists led by a tour guide step up next to him
he is surrounded by them
tarek talks to mr
walter is playing the drum
he finishes with an end beat
he looks around the quiet apartment
walter is waiting for tarek
the visiting room is empty
suddenly the door opens on the detainee side of the glass and a very young latin woman walks out tentatively
she almost looks absurd in the oversized blue jumpsuit
she looks at walter unsure if she is supposed to approach the glass and talk to him
walter just stares back also unsure of what to do
they are caught in awkward moment
finally walter manages a nod
she nods back and smiles
it is the innocent smile of a child
suddenly a female guard appears in the doorway and beckons the young girl back inside
the young girl looks at walter one last moment before disappearing behind the door
walter is talking to tarek
but i thought you said you went to the hearing
i remember it
so why is there a final order on you
did he say
he didnt know yet
he just said that unless he can find a way to reopen the case quickly theyre going to deport me
maybe you should call your mother
she might have
i dont want her to worry
i can handle this
tarek shakes his head
did he say anything else
three years ago i was working for some guy who said he was going to sponsor me for my green card but then he turned out to be jerk
but the lawyer said that might allow us to reopen the case
i dont even understand it
walter there are guys who have been in here for years
i cant do that walter
ill go crazy
hes trying to deal with the case as quickly as possible
tarek goes silent
i have to go back to connecticut
ill be reachable by phone if you need me for anything
tareks mind is racing
he shakes his head
dont forget about me in here
are you still practicing
you should go back to the drum circle
but listen to that fela cd
that will help you i promise
so show me what youve been working on
i need some music man
tarek points to the shelf in front of walter
they cant arrest you
at least not yet
walter looks around and then cradles the phone in his shoulder and starts to bang a simple beat on his counter top
tarek watches and listens for a moment
there it is
you are getting better
and then he joins in
the two men continue to play together
walter is packing his suitcase
suddenly there is a knock at his door
he exits the room
walter opens the door
standing there is a strikingly attractive forty five year old arab woman
she seems startled to see walter
i must have the wrong apartment
she starts to walk down the hall
can i help you
im looking for my son
are you tareks mother
this is tareks apartment
share the apartment with him
the arab woman is cautious
he did not mention that he lived with someone
im not here very often
i live in connecticut
is tarek here
hes not here
but please come in
mouna walks into the apartment
she stands by the door
im mouna khalil
im sorry to show up unannounced but my son calls me everyday
he has not called me now for five days
i have tried his cell phone but he does not answer
would you like to sit down
would you like something to drink
coffee or water
is my son alright mr
tarek was arrested
hes being held in a detention center in queens
they are trying to deport him
where is queens
its not far from here
you have been there
i saw him yesterday
how did this happen
he was stopped in the subway station
he didnt do anything wrong
i would like to go there
the lawyer mentioned that
i dont think that you can
i know i cant visit tarek mr
i just want to see where they are holding him
i can take you if youd like
let me get my coat
mouna breathes deeply in an attempt to control her emotions
she looks around the apartment and spots tareks drum
the sight of it is almost enough to push her over the edge
the chinese musician is playing on the platform
mouna and walter are watching him
walter and mouna are sitting side by side on the subway
walter and mouna exit the subway station and walk down the empty street
have you been to new york before mrs
tarek wanted to come to new york to play music
i did not want him to go but
do you have children mr
i have a son
he lives in london
and your wife
my wife passed away
walter and mouna stop across the street from the detention center
this is where the prison is
walter points to the detention center
it does not look like a prison
i think thats the point
how many people are in there
tarek said about three hundred
there is a coffee shop on that corner
its not very nice but
ill wait there
she takes a letter out of her bag and hands it to walter
walter turns and walks into the facility
mouna lingers taking in the building
walter is waiting for tarek
he is watching as a latin woman holds her baby up to the glass as her husband taps on it from the other side
finally a door opens and tarek walks out
he waves and smiles
walter picks up his phone
tarek picks up his
walter i thought you were leaving
tarek your mother is here
this stops tarek cold
she is waiting outside
when did she arrive
why did she come
she can do nothing for me
she said she hadnt heard from you
listen to me
she can not stay here
she doesnt know anyone in new york
im sorry but you must get her to go back to michigan
i have a letter from her
walter takes it out and puts it up to the glass
its a dingy place occupied by truck drivers and factory workers
mouna sitting in a booth clutching a cup of tea
she looks very out of place
two detention center guards enter and sit down in a booth
mouna watches them
an arab waiter is cleaning the counter
he keeps looking at mouna
do you need anything else
in arabic where are you from
in arabic i am palestinian from damascus
in arabic ah
i knew it
i am from egypt
why are you here
in arabic i am visiting my son
in arabic he is in detention
in arabic yes
the waiter shakes his head
in arabic its a bad place
i have a green card
he nods to the guards
in arabic theyre the ones taking care of your son
they come here everyday
they dont tip
mouna is uncomfortable
in arab dont worry
they cant understand us
walter enters and walks over to mounas booth
walter nods and sits down
he hands mouna her letter
how is he
hes good but hes concerned about you being here
i will not leave
khalil im not sure that your being in new york will do any good
we have a very good lawyer working on tareks case
politely but forceful mr
vale i cannot go back to michigan knowing that my son is in that building
even if i cant see him i will stay
she stands up ready to leave
shall we go
mouna digs in her purse
in arabic the tea is on me
in arabic thank you
in arabic is that your lawyer
or your husband
in arabic goodbye
in arabic see you next time
walter follows mouna out
walter and mouna arrive back at walters apartment building
jacob emerges from the front door with sprinkles
he sees mouna
oh hello again
did you find your son
to walter i let her in earlier
to mouna im jacob by the way
i live on the third floor
and this is sprinkles
nice to meet you jacob
so you two know each other
there is an awkward pause
vale knows my son
who is that
he is very nice
and so is his girlfriend
they are both so polite
my mother and i are planning a trip to go to israel next summer
shes always wanted to go
i hope you enjoy it
now if youll excuse me
mouna nods and heads into the building
we need to go on our walk and do our business
very nice to meet you mouna
you too jacob
mouna continues up the stairs
walter follows her
walter and mouna enter the apartment
mouna picks up her suitcase
thank you mr
where are you going
i will find a hotel
you can stay here
you can use tareks room
thank you for your offer but i cannot accept this
i dont want to impose on you
youre not imposing
i would like you to stay
again thank you
but i will manage
walter finally steps aside and opens the door
mouna walks down the stairs
walter is standing at the top of the stairway
i was with tarek when he was arrested
he was in the subway in the first place because of me
even if its just for the night
walters plea is heartfelt
mouna looks at him and then she looks down the stairs for a long moment considering her options
walter enters the room and sets down mounas suitcase
she follows him into the cramped bedroom
the bathroom is just across the hall
thank you mr
you can call me walter
and i am mouna
do you need anything else
walter leaves shutting the door behind him
mouna sits on the bed and looks around the room
the sound of an airplane taking off breaks the night quiet
walter walks out of his bedroom
he hears talking from the living room
he walks down the hall and sees mouna sitting on the couch in the living room talking on her cell phone in arabic
he turns and walks back down the hallway
walter pours a cup of coffee
he notices two newspapers on the counter
one is the financial times and the other is al hayat an arabic newspaper
he picks up the financial times and reads the front page
tarek said hello
how is he
i cant really tell
he wants me to leave
but i am not leaving
well you can stay here as long as you need to
that is very generous of you
thank you for the newspaper
mouna nods and pours some more coffee for herself
did tarek and his girlfriend zainab live here together
and where is she now
shes staying with her cousin in the bronx
i would like to meet her
we can go by her stall
she sells jewelry in a stall
a large office building in downtown manhattan
walter and mouna are standing in silence
do you spend a lot of time in the city
i just came down to present a paper at a conference
you wrote it
well i coauthored it
walter and mouna are talking to the mr
and what happened after the hearing
it took two years
and your appeal was denied
then they should have sent you a bag and baggage letter which basically tells you where to show up and be deported
but you didnt receive it
i would remember this
did you move
eventually we had to
but we had our mail advanced
shah is satisfied
well it wouldnt be the first time that happened
and pre it wasnt much of a priority tracking people down
mouna bristles at the implied connection
so if they didnt get the letter then does this help us
it keeps our chances alive
if they got it and just ignored it then we couldnt push to reopen the case
so you can help him
its still a long shot
like i said the governments approach has changed radically
its very black and white now
either you belong or you dont
which means a lot of people who have been living here for years are suddenly being swept up and thrown into detention
he starts writing tareks lucky
most of them dont even have lawyers
without looking up relatively speaking
we just have to move quickly to get an emergency stay from the board of immigration
then well stick with the motion to reopen pending his green card application
mouna and walter share a look
can you explain what that means
actually i dont have the time right now
i have to be in court very shortly how long will he be in detention
without looking up i cant predict that
im sorry but i am gonna have to wrap this up
walter looks at mouna
mouna stares at the mr
do you have children mr
and for what its worth my uncle was deported after raising a family here for twenty three years
if i can get tarek out i will
where are you from
walter and mouna are standing at the fair
which one is she
in the middle
surprised the black woman
that is zainab
she is very black
zainab is sitting at her table when walter approaches
she is genuinely surprised and happy to see him
this is mouna khalil
she quickly stands up
it is a pleasure to meet you mrs
call me mouna
i did not know you were coming
neither did i
mouna looks at her for a long moment
then she inspects her jewelry
zainab is uncharacteristically nervous
your jewelry is very beautiful
do you have time for coffee or a walk
zainab looks around at her table
i would like that
but i have to watch my table
mouna and zainab both turn to look at walter
walter is sitting behind zainabs table in the fair
its a long way from the classroom
a few young women walk past and browse zainabs jewelry
they look at walter who just nods
mouna and zainab sit and talk
im living with my cousin
he has two kids
and his mother
i mean his wife
im sorry i am very nervous
i dont know
have you spoken with tarek
he called me this morning
he is doing all right
i wish that i could see him
just for a minute
how long have you been here
i was in detention when i first arrived
it was horrible
i would probably still be there but they closed the facility for poor conditions
they released some of the women on parole because we were
i met tarek one year later
beat i am sorry for what happened with tarek
i hope you do not blame me
i do not blame you
zainab starts to break
tarek was doing nothing wrong
i miss him so much
i dont know what i am going to do without him
he said the same thing about you
zainab i would like you to do something for me
i would like you to show me something that you and tarek liked to do
some place that you like to go
whatever you want
but maybe we should get walter first
they both smile at the thought of walter still at zainabs table
walter and mouna walk down the street listening to zainab who is wheeling her jewelry supplies behind her
walter mouna and zainab are standing at the railing of the ferry which is making its way across the harbor
the statue of liberty looms large the ferry route providing a perfect vantage point
so what is in staten island
i dont know
we never got off
we just would go to the other side and then come back
and it felt like we were going somewhere
that is where the towers were
i never saw them but tarek did
zainab crosses to the other railing and points
and over there is the statue
and behind that is ellis island
sometimes tarek would point at the statue and jump up and down like we were arriving to new york for the first time
it was very funny
can you go up in the statue
i think so
you havent been
walters cell phone rings
he looks at it
into the phone hello
he walks away from the mouna and zainab
im still in new york actually
i stayed down here to do some research
im on a boat
yes a boat
listen charles ill explain when i see you but i have to go right now
ill call you back
walter hangs up the phone and rejoins mouna and zainab
walter is visiting with tarek
another detainee walks behind tarek and taps him on the shoulder
tarek nods hello and then keeps talking to walter
you went on the ferry
my mother too
she liked it
did zainab tell you how we used pretend we arriving in new york for the first time
she told us
you know they dont even let us outside here
they just cut a hole in the roof in one place
its crazy stuff
tarek looks around the room
and they seemed to get along
zainab and my mother
i think your mother likes her very much
then it fades
my mothers not going home is she
i dont think so
i know shes thinking about my father
he spent seven years in jail in syria for something he wrote in the newspaper
by the time they released him he was very sick
he died two months later
thats when we came here
she thinks the same thing is gonna happen to me
tarek thinks for a long moment
he shakes his head
you know i have never seen them together
zainab and my mother
walter and mouna are walking home
are you hungry mouna
we can stop for dinner
i would prefer to cook if you dont mind
should we stop at a market
thats probably a good idea
mouna is preparing dinner
walter comes in and takes a bottle of wine out of the refrigerator
would you like a glass of wine
no thank you
walter pours his glass
i need to go back to connecticut tomorrow
i told tarek
how long will you be gone
i dont know yet
ill try to make it back to visit tarek as soon as i can
you dont have keep visiting him walter
im sure you are busy
ill see what i can do
dinner will be ready soon
walter walks out of the kitchen
mouna and walter are eating in silence
do you go to broadway walter
i havent been in a long time
tarek sent me the cd for phantom of the opera for my birthday
the music is lovely
have you seen it
i havent either but i think i know every word
tarek is teaching me the drum
how is it going
well i sound a lot better when hes playing with me
how is your teaching going walter
walter seems caught off guard by the question
i have a lighter schedule so i can work on my book
what is it about
well it covers quite a bit so its hard to explain
walter drinks his glass of wine
are you almost finished
you dont like to talk about your work
its just a bit complicated
why is that
walter is agitated
it just is
its just not a process thats easy to talk about with someone whos not a writer
walters cheap shot lands
mouna is stung
i didnt mean to pry
there is an awkward silence
i shouldnt have spoken to you like that
walter picks up the wine bottle and fills his glass
walter is sitting on the edge of his bed and takes off his shoes
an empty new york street
mouna and walter round the corner walking together
she is holding his briefcase
walter is carrying the drum and his duffle bag
they arrive at the parking garage
walter hands a ticket to the garage attendant
he takes his briefcase from mouna
you have my number if you need anything
ill be fine
have a safe trip
well good bye
mouna turns and walks down the street
walters car arrives
walter pulls into his driveway
he gets out of the car
he opens the trunk and takes out his bag and then his drum
walter walks into the lecture hall
he sets his briefcase down
he takes out some papers and opens them
walter is stopped at a traffic light in town
walter sees karen walking toward him
she is talking on her cell phone and does not notice him
walter just watches her pass without saying a word
walter sits in his office working
he stops and listens to the silence
walter pours himself a drink and wanders around the empty house
walter opens the front door and walks outside
walter walks onto the front lawn and looks around the sleepy neighborhood
he listens to the quiet
its a stark contrast from new york
walter roots through his briefcase and pulls out the fela kuti cd
he slips the cd into the stereo
he presses play
fela kutis dont gag me blares over the speakers
walter is sitting in a chair and playing the drum along with the fela song
he is only wearing a t shirt and boxers
charles talks to walter
they stand up and shake hands
three movers are carefully removing the piano from walters house as walter and barbara watson look on
walter drives back down the highway
the fela kuti music is playing
he is tapping on the steering wheel
walter walks quickly up the stairs to the fourth floor
he seems to be moving with a little more pep
as he approaches his door he hears music emanating from his apartment
its a piano sonata
the music stops him in his tracks
he listens for a couple of moments
finally he walks inside
walter enters to find mouna mopping the floor
fresh flowers are on the table
she sees walter and smiles
she turns down the music
i did not expect you so soon
i was just cleaning a bit
i hope you dont mind
i like this cd very much
the music is lovely
she picks up the cd
is it your wife
she was beautiful
mouna sets down the cd
she notices walters glasses
these are different glasses
are they new
i was going to make some lunch
are you hungry
then he returns
i was wondering if
thursday night do you have plans
no walter i have no plans
well i thought that
we might do something
walter nods and walks toward his room
mouna watches him go and smiles
walter and tarek are talking
tarek is very anxious
they keep moving people
i dont know
i think to other detention centers
two moroccan guys were just moved
they had no idea
suddenly they were just gone
has anyone said anything to you
no one in here knows anything
im not a criminal
i have committed no crime
what do they think
im a terrorist
there are no terrorists in here
the terrorists have money
they have support
this is not fair
angrily how do you know
youre out there
tareks question stops walter in his tracks
tarek tries to regain his composure
im starting to wonder if im ever going to get out of here
i sit in here at night and i keep thinking about zainab
i just want to play my music and live my life
whats so wrong about that
walter mouna and zainab are sitting at a cafe
walter is on his cell phone
into the phone ok
he hangs up
what did he say
he would make some calls but they can move him to another facility at their discretion
he said it could be anywhere
there is even one in louisiana
where they had the floods
thats so far
did the lawyer say anything else
no he didnt know anything else
no one seems to know anything
it feels like syria
darren and the bass player are playing
they have a new drummer
mouna and zainab sit at a back table talking
mouna notices zainabs necklace
zainab takes it off and gives it to her
walter buys two newspapers
one in english and one in arabic
mouna walks along the street
she stops at a small clothing store and looks into the window
she walks into the store
mouna is sitting on her bed speaking in arabic
walter dressed in a jacket and tie is sitting in his bedroom
suddenly mouna appears in the doorway
sorry to keep you waiting
how is he
he says hello
he wants to make sure that you are practicing your drum
you look very nice
should we go
walter and mouna ride in the cab
mouna looks out the window
this city is just so huge
it never ends
the cab pulls over
walter and mouna climb out
walter pays the cab driver and turns to mouna
walter points to the phantom of the opera marquee behind her
are we seeing it
is that ok
i am so excited
walter smiles as he and mouna walk toward the theatre
the lights and sounds of times square
walter and mouna walk through the throngs of tourists after the play
walter hails a cab and they jump in
walter and mouna both sit in a french restaurant finishing their salad
i have to say that show was really kind of scary
it was kind of scary
the both smile
a waiter approaches and picks up their plates
are you finished
how is everything
but i think i would like a glass of wine
i didnt even think to ask
its not every night that you see the phantom
to the waiter ill have a cabernet
the waiter leaves
i havent been to theatre in a long time
there is a place in syria called maaloula
it is a huge outdoor theater
we used to take tarek there to see concerts
the waiter sets down the two glasses of wine
in arabic cheers
they clink glasses and drink
mouna ive taken a leave of absence for the rest of the semester
walter is suddenly self conscious
walter is suddenly self conscious
i just thought i might spend some more time in new york
walter you do not have to do this for tarek
i want to
but you have to be in connecticut
you have your teaching
and your book
its fine really
this is not your problem walter
its ok that you are busy
her simple words strike a chord with walter
im not busy
not at all
beat mouna the truth is i havent been doing any work for a long time
you just presented your paper at the conference
he is beginning to unravel
i didnt even write it
i just read it
ive been teaching the same course for twenty years
it doesnt mean anything to me
none of it does
i pretend that im busy
that im writing
but im not doing anything
walter trails off
i appreciate you telling me this
the waiter returns and pours some more water
walter what would you do if you didnt teach
i dont know
i think that is exciting
not to know
walter considers this as if for the first time
mouna what do you do
do you mean for work
i work in a car dealership
i take care of the accounting
its very exciting
mouna and walter walk into the apartment
mouna takes off her coat
what time is it
i have not been up this late in a long time
i think that happens a lot in new york
thank you walter
that was a very nice evening
its the most fun ive had in a long time
i told tarek i was going to take you
he was very happy about it
mouna is touched by the comment
her mood shifts
good night walter
and with that she turns and walks into her bedroom
walter wakes up
he checks his watch
he notices that his phone is blinking
he picks it up and listens to it
he throws open the door and hurries into the
mouna is sitting at the table
theres a message from tarek
what did he say
just that they were moving him
he didnt know what it meant
without another word mouna is up and putting on her coat
walter and mouna ride in the cab
walter is on the phone
well when do you expect him back
can you have him call me the minute he is
its an emergency
he hangs up
hes still in court
to the cab driver can you hurry please
i hate this feeling
walter and mouna get out of the cab
walter rushes in
mouna waits outside
walter walks up to the guard booth
im here for bed
the male guard checks the computer screen
he is no longer with us
what does that mean
im not sure
youre not sure
was he moved to another facility
i dont know
i just know that this detainee is no longer in the facility
well can you ask someone who does know
the guard picks up the phone and dials
he has a long conversation that walter cannot hear
there are a few other visitors in the waiting room
they watch walter
did you find him
hes been removed
he was deported this morning
how can that be
is there any way to contact him
i dont know
i dont think so
you dont think so
what kind of answer is that
im sorry sir
thats all the information that i have
now please step away from the window
you can call the ice if you have any further questions
the number is on the wall
walters wheels are spinning
he is helpless
he looks around the room at all of the other immigrants visiting friends and family members
they are watching him with blank faces
please step away from my window
walter doesnt move
he checks his watch
for the last time step away from my window
finally walter turns and starts to walk out of the detention center
he reaches the exit and then spins around and storms back toward the guard booth
he completely loses control
angrily shouting you cant just take people away like that
do you hear me
he was a good man
a good person
he had a life here
you cant just take away whoever you want
its not fair
we are not just helpless children
do you hear me
the guard just stares back blankly
the other visitors watch in disbelief
they are unaccustomed to this type of outburst as is walter who now stands trembling in the middle of the room
its as if something inside him snapped
something that he has been holding on to for a long time
he is suddenly adrift
unsure of what to do next
mouna is standing there
he looks at her
there is nothing we can do
walter looks a bit lost
he looks back at the guard who just stares back at him
come on walter
she reaches out and takes walters hand
and then she leads him out
walter and mouna ride in a taxi
they are both depleted
mouna shakes her head
he did nothing wrong
she is overwhelmed by the events
she breaks down and starts to cry
walter puts his arm around her
walter watches as mouna tells zainab
zainab buckles and hugs mouna
walter is looking out the window
mouna walks out of the kitchen and turns out the light
she walks over and stands next to walter
walter i need to go back to syria
i should to be there for tarek
when are you going to leave
i already bought a ticket
its best for me to be there as soon as possible
walter just looks at her
the news is piercing
you wont be able to come back here
mouna smiles warmly
good night walter
mouna leans in and kisses him gently on the cheek
she turns and walks toward her room
walter watches her go and then looks back onto the street
walter is lying awake in bed
there is a knock at the door
he sits up
the door opens and a shaft of light cuts across the room
mouna stands in the doorway
walter stares at her for a moment and then turns down the bed sheets
mouna walks over and lies down next time
walter pulls the sheets back over her
they sit in silence for a long moment holding each other
its my fault
what happened to tarek
i did receive the letter telling us to leave
i threw it away
i never told him
walter can only listen
we were here for three years by the time the letter arrived
i had found a job
tarek was in school
everyone told me not to worry
that the government did not care
and it appeared to be true
and then after time you forget
you think that you really belong
walter gently touches her
its not your fault
he puts his arm around her and she collapses into him
its not your fault
they lie together
mouna and walter are sitting in the airport
have you visited your son in london
you should visit him
mouna takes a small decorative pouch out of her purse
walter takes it and opens it
its a wrist band from zainabs collection
zainab and i picked it out especially for you
its very nice
let me see
mouna puts it on walters wrist
i like it
so do i
you look cool
you are very cool walter
mouna checks her watch
i should go
the both stand up
walter and mouna arrive at the security check point
mouna sets down her bag
thank you walter
she leans in and they hug long and hard
i dont want you to go
mouna kisses him
she whispers i dont want to go habibi
then she picks up her bag and walks off
walter watches her go
she turns and waves
walter waves back and then she disappears into the security check point
walter walks quickly along the street with his drum
walter approaches the subway and enters
walter swipes his card and walks down into the subway
walter walks along the subway platform
he stops about midway and sits down on a bench
the uptown subway train enters and obscures our view of him
finally the train pulls away
walter is still sitting but now he is playing his drum
he is fully committed
another train wipes frame
zainab sits behind her table staring straight ahead
we hold on her for a long moment and then
black card give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free the wretched refuse of your teeming shore
send these the homeless tempest tost to me i lift my lamp beside the golden door
