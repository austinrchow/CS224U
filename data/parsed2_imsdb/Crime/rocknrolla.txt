beat london my good man is fast becoming the financial and cultural capital of the world
and of course the russians have come to town

they dont haggle the price they double the price
russians come prices rise and it doesnt stop

one two and the lawyer are here looking at the building it is a bit dilapidated and bleak
it looks like a great deal
we cut back into the office where the lawyer lays out the building plans
these are the plans
it costs ten and itll be worth twenty with planning
but first you gotta give the councilor a drink
cut to the desk of a councilor mid thirties middle management who is receiving a brown envelope from the lawyer

the lawyer is on the phone with mumbles and one two
into phone im sorry boys cant get the planning
one two is on the phone

he cant get the planing
lenny is looking out to one two and mumbles who are standing outside his car looking very white
lenny screams from the back seat

whats wrong with you arch
thats a bit strong isnt it len

they need a bit of fear cos otherwise theyre gonna come up against me
need a little lesson dont they
one two and mumbles are here its quiet until
we gotta sell
and be left with what
just gotta start again
start credits over sports arena entrance
lenny is being walked down a corridor the walls are lined with photographs of old soccer stars
pink revision a
on each side of him are two escorts ex military types heavy looking
as they pass each door we realize where ever he is going it has to be important
the escorts talk in to their microphones and to the different guards on each door way
every now and then we see the sports arena in the back ground
at last we reach the main door to the head office
as the door is opened we see a small crowd of men in suits gathered around a kind looking man with bright blue eyes
he nods a couple of times
we cut to the front of lenny who is clearly impressed mr
blue eyes pays him no attention
the small crowd of business men shake hands and head to the door at which lenny is waiting patiently
close up on the back of uri russian jew s slick and well groomed he is our mr
blue eyes overlooking his sports arena

glad you could join us here lenny
its nice to see you uri
there is a pause i can see we are very much alike you and i lenny
we like to get things done
beat whats it going to cost me
first let me make clear how much we can help you benefit from this deal
with out me it will take you five to ten years to get the permission to erect your arena
beat second with government policy as it so stands we both know its unlikely that youd ever get that consent
beat thirdly in legal fees transactions and building consent youd be paying to million without any real guarantee of that result
we cut to uri unfazed he just wants the figure
pink revision a
seven million euros
i expect a guarantee that i have consent within six months and no red tape
thats right uri you can consider that done
pause while tension stews then
uri walks to the bar
lenny follows trying to contain his excitement hes out of his league a welcome to the billionaires club look has struck him pink
lenny passes a picture thats sat on an easel
oh thats a nice picture uri hasnt it got errrh depth

theres a pause while the tax man looks at his colleague
shut the door
his colleague gets up and shuts the door

otherwise theyll move the company off shore tomorrow and youll spend the next twenty years chasing an imaginary forty million around every republic that grows bananas
bertie lifts out papers from his brief case
i see why you married her now bertie
the two tax men look at each other theyre thinking the same thought
i told you wed make a great team
you know why you get those deals
she looks relatively bored
because those fat sad old men like it when you swear at them
they shake like cocktails and sweat like semtex when you raise that posh little voice
you my love are a rare commodity
beat now come on give your bertie a smile
i dont feel like smiling

lenny is standing in front of the fire place smoking and looking very anxious
there is a bald spot above his head where a picture once stood a picture light illuminates an clearly empty space
he is horrified by the stupidity of the question
lets take a wild stab in the dark shall we bandy
archy slap him and then send him to school cos i cant take any more of this

two accountants come out of the back door while in route they click their central locking open on the car waiting
one two is already on them as the accountants go to open their car door
he flashes the gun in his belt
the accountants are too shocked to even know what is going on

the accountants see the gun but still look for a way out
mumbles meets them with another gun
pink revision a

malcolm drops his bags and starts to get busy
hes got a strong scottish accent that has been influenced by last nights crack for dinner and two large whiskys for breakfast
good afternoon gentlemen
he coughs nervously as the boys look on dead pan
he sees dolly
excuse me my love any chance of a wee dram of water to oil the larynx

its far too small and the fur stops half way up his arms its not possible to do the buttons up
i must apologize for my assistants handicaps
he has unusually long arms and an alarmingly small neck
beat the crowd is unimpressed now i do agree it doesnt seem like the right time to acquire a coat of such thermal efficiency
however i have been informed that we are looking at a very white winter
plus gentlemen and fine lady
he winks at dolly who has got him a very large glass of water christmas is always round the corner
he downs the water without it touching the sides
where did you find these two junkies
what is this a fuckin double act
shut up and tell us the price
all in good time gentlemen all in good time
beat paul why dont you sit down for a while
if paul doesnt sit down hes gonna fall down
he stumbles into the card table on his way to a seat knocking drinks and cards everywhere
from under the table next we have a very much sought after affair seen in very very glossy magazines
he jumps up wearing the most ridiculously oversized fur coat and matching hat you have ever seen
the famous but rare black bear from the dark mountains of siberian calcutta
he starts to do a slow spin at which point we see a large white stipe running down the furs back
get an eye full of that stripe gentlemen
have a look at that its a six foot skunk
everyone thinks its very fuckin funny
the laughter is interrupted only by the buzzer
buzzzzzzzzzz fred goes to answers the buzzer
and all of this could be yours for a staggeringly low
cut to fred at the buzzer

back to the table everyones ears prick up at the name
malcolm pauses before he panics he can tell something is up

everyone starts tucking their money into their pockets
fred makes his way back to the table
he speaks to malcolm and paul

archy leans over to take the bag and one two sticks a few notes in his pocket
and buy yourself a new pair of shoes
archy turns and heads out hes smiling and mutters to himself
uri has got some serious stink boat gin palace on the river thames

archy leans back to hear what tank is about to tell him
lenny walks into the warehouse where we see two sloanes posh kids s strapped to a pair of chairs with weights on the bottom
there are large leather belts wrapped around them
right i am going to tell you how this works
youre going in the drink and i am going to make a cup of tea
archy grabs a hook attached to an electric winch and attaches it to their leather belts
underneath the floor boards is the famous river thames
i hope for your sakes you can hold your breath for as long as it takes to boil that kettle
after that i am going to ask you a question one question
you are going to give me a name and if its the right name i send you home warm and dry in a fresh set of clothes

he presses the green button and a hatch in the floor opens
the two sloanes are lowered into the river protesting
handsome bobs got the long face on

we cut back to ten years ago
cut to a shot of a year old boy with a cut under his eye singing bank robber by the clash in to the mirror
hes wearing just his boxer shorts and enjoying himself hes gonna be a rock star
from behind we see his bedroom door open but the music is to loud for the boy to have heard the entrance
we see lenny ten years younger entering we can tell via the body language that he is irritated
he pauses then walks up suddenly slapping the boy very hard across the side of the face
its enough to knock him out the boy goes down shot like a bullet out of a barrel
the red hand then slaps the stereo off
listen to me boy listen
i never did like you and neither did your real father
youre a reject a wrong un a fuckin fairy in the mirror that i inherited from your mother but she aint with us no more so now its just you
in one week you go back to school the best fuckin school in the country i might add then youll be gone for another term
beat in the mean time show me some gratitude and keep the fuckin music down
we cut back to present and meet johnny story think pete doherty meets richard ashcroft or posh john posh good looking alarmingly skinny and pale in a grey sort of
pink revision a
hes still listening to bank robber dancing round with a couple of toy guns
his mate who is not so posh meet pete is sporting a balaclava at present
theyve been cracking it up and the paraphernalia is everywhere
johnny is standing in front of the mirror next to the mirror is the painting and oh he loves it
pete rolls up his balaclava up and slams the stereo off
just couldnt its got me
thats what art does pete it gets you
youd get a good few notes for that
go on john jog it on
you wouldnt understand

he does a quick moon walk hes taking the piss
youre in need of an education thats what you need but your dad never gave a shit about you did he
and that is why you are on the gear
your gear is your surrogate father
leave off john what is this shrink time
come on pedro share
im your sponsor doctor
your dad if youre feeling a bit of regression coming on
beat but first we should have a drink in our hands
rough old bar there are a couple of old wasters staggering around in the distance
johnny and pete have now got drinks in their hands
my dad made me watch bonanza every sunday after church
pink revision a
thats got to have done some damage all those guns and cowboys
it wasnt all bad he sometimes made me laugh too

he tickled me if thats what you mean
now thats it
thats what i was looking for you see your dad is a monster pedro a tickling monster
singing pedros dads a tickling monster
johnny helps himself to some wasters drink at the bar for a quick refreshment
understandably the waster doesnt look happy and his three friends dont look happy either
thats my drink
johnny gives the waster and his friends the masturbation signal without even bothering to look at them
fuck you singalong youre no help and stop calling me pedro
the waster grabs a bottle from the bar ready to take some action
johnny grabs a pencil from his top pocket he holds it out like its a knife
its almost a joke
come on boy ill have you and ya girlfriends
ill do the lot of yazz
the waster is lost
johnny is not physically scary hes only scary because hes quite clearly mad
he looks like robert deniro in taxi driver mad as mars he catches himself in the mirror he likes what he sees
ciggy falling out of his mouth he sort of takes the piss out of himself smiles tough johnny the waster backs off he doesnt want junkie madness
pink revision a
leaning over his shoulder mock serious was i good or what pete
its all in the eyes
he raises his ridiculous eye brows junkies ill shit em
johnny sits back down next to pete
did your dad do anything else to you pete
he hit me bad as well the slag
hit with a chain
pete starts to lift up his shirt
johnny stands what are you doing
im not going to tickle you pete im not your dad
he looks over and sees pete has got the most horrific scars on his back
johnny notices them and stops in his tracks
johnny walks back over to pete and very tenderly touches his back it feels horrible and bobbled
soft i find that profoundly offensive pedro
twos up on a snout to show i care
he pulls out a ciggy
pete takes it
i used to think it had something to do with bonanza
your dad was jealous
cos you dad isnt sure hes your dad cos you dont look like him
what do i look like then
you have all the facial characteristics of north american native livapuddlian indian
pink revision a
see your dad thought you were a red indian and bonanza triggered your fathers unconscious feelings
pete looks at johnny
johnny starts to smile

that theres not much you cant do
slow down tinker bell youll never sing the same if ya teeth arent your own
you gonna take care of him
smiling what do you think we are gangsters
thats not my style and especially not with genetics and all
there is a look of confusion from roman and mickey
bloods thicker than poison moon beam now do us all a favor before you catch a cold
one two walks into the speeler he looks like a lost man
he looks over at the guys sitting around talking they stop and look up
where have you been
you were missed in court today
thats not very compassionate is it didnt turn up for your amigos funeral
the phone rings in the back ground dolly answers it
everybody else was there but you and i got the feeling you were the only person handsome wanted to see
one two turns a little nasty
what are you trying to say fred
you wanna have it out now
from behind we see handsome bob and mumbles walk into the speeler
handsome bob sneaks up and put his hands over one twos eyes
one two spins round in major shock he sees bob and he doesnt like it
all the boys look on like one twos going to hug him
the prosecution lost the paper work

dolly walks over and interrupts
pink revision a

one two comes back into the room he is still in disbelief
so bob got off big fucking deal
everyone looks a little lost i have a little bit of work for you cookie we have a party to go to
lenny has another large vodka in his hand while uri smiles
pink revision a
youre looking well lenny
well thank you uri thats a real compliment from a man that obviously takes good care of himself
i suppose youre wondering why you are here
i assume you want to check that everything is still kosher at my end
pause i was a little surprised you didnt come through at the appropriate time but i reckon you have your reasons
i assume everything is still as you say
lenny milks the moment and after a few seconds of mock thought he speaks
dont you worry uri that ones on me
partners and all that but i wouldnt like it to go south again makes things difficult if you know what i mean
i understand lenny and i wouldnt like things to go wrong either
which brings me conveniently to my next point
ever since the painting my lucky painting hasnt been hanging on my wall things have not been
i know this is a rude request because we have not concluded our business but i feel as though i need it
long pause while lenny scrambles for an excuse
lenny enters the car looking a little peachy
archy takes one look and grimaces
pink revision a
fuckin hell len hes given you that bar tan again
you wanna leave that vodka alone

archy looks a little worried
oh i see

the boys are still reeling from the news that johnny is lennys son
pink revision a
how about that then johnny storys father

why doesnt anybody know
would you want anyone to know that he was your dad
would we have taken him on if we had known

as one two walks away he runs into tom again who stands in his way
yellow revision a
let me tell you something hard case if you start any trouble around her
one two gives him the quick one two punch tom is knocked out cold he catches him standing up and lowers him to the floor
one two walks off
yellow revision b
we cut to mumbles on the sofa who is watching one two he grimaces
bertie is next to him
and thats why they call him one two
so youre part of the wild bunch
stella says youre dangerous
mumbles smiles and flicks his cigar ash into berties glass
he knows hes a poof and keeps his eyes on him a second too long just to get bertie excited
does she now
so is your friend part of the wild bunch
bertie is talking about handsome and mumbles knows it
that young man is the greatest gun slinger in town
bertie smiles then how come i dont know him
beat i know all about your type
how is that then
im a criminal lawyer
and i know a secret about your part of town
what secrets that then
you have an informer in your neck of the woods
oh yeah so whats his name
you have to pay for secrets
yellow revision c
thats not nice but while your at it whats the price
he looks to handsome i want to meet the gun slinger
mumbles looks over to handsome
cut to one two who has just run into stella there is a man holding a tray of drinks next to them
so youre a dancer
am i a dancer
shall we put the record straight
one two makes room in front of him and starts to dance relativity badly
you get the feeling he probably could dance but he just cant be bothered to make an effort
you see its all in the genes
he slowly turns my dad was a dancer and his dad before that so gradually its percolated the old dna
you not joining me
sure i like to dance
she stands up and dances just like him
hello i can sense a little competition
so what you got for me
the same jobs back on again
beat dont throw my rhythm
same time same place same money
what about security
same as before but theyre not my accountants
a couple of theirs
other than that should be just the same
we cut to mumbles who has gone up to handsome
handsome i got a job for you
see that man on the couch
the one thats staring at us
how can i miss him
do me a favor chat him up
fuck off what do think i am
hes some big wig lawyer who knows about an informer in our part of town and since you were just looking at a five stretch i thought you might be
handsome gets the picture and heads over to bertie
one two appears and approaches mumbles
we got another job on same as before
its all go around here isnt it
den of iniquity this place is
you know your old lady well her big time lawyer husband hes a beard got a crush on the handsome
what are you talking about
put it this way i dont think they married for love
i gotta get a breath of fresh air
we cut to to handsome who has come to sit on the same sofa as bertie
so i hear you have a secret but you look like you might have more than one
why dont you confess
i dont want to talk about work
if you tell me who the informer is we will talk about whatever you want to anyway you dont have to tell me anything
if hes an informer youll have his depositions and poems
my my not just a pretty face
how do you know about those sort of things
handsome scribbles out his number on a piece of paper and gives it to bertie
lets have a drink during the week and ill tell you all about it all i need is a little bit of paper work
one two is on his way out the door when cookie stops him
oi one two i am going to make a killing out of this lot theyve definitely got more money than brains
to one two i owe you one boyo
johnny is watching cartoons trying to skin up a joint using a page of a book he puts it down in frustration
pete walks in grabs the picture from its place and starts to walk out
come back here
pete stops in his tracks
where do you think you are going with that painting
hes flapping you never said it was your dads or whatever you wanna call him
you gotta give it back john people are looking for it bad people
the streets are alive with the sound of pain
you may have a point pete but i cant give it up
you know why
meet me in the pub in two minutes
johnny walks in and approaches the barman
he doesnt like johnny
what do you want
now now no need for that tone bar steward
i am merely on mission to acquire a shot of your finest scotch and a packet of your
pointing to papers cheapest rolling paper
green or red
king size of course along with a packet of your shiniest coffin nails
the barman reaches for a pack of cigarettes
dont make a scene in here boy
johnny puts a large note on the bar
put the change in the blind box my good man and remember
he leans into the bar and shuts one eye
in the kingdom of the blind the one eyed man is king the barman is left with his mouth open
johnny walks to the piano to drink his scotch
there are a few beer mats on the piano johnny wipes the mats off with a glide of his hand and they fall to the floor
he raises the lid coughs composes himself and extends his hands through his sleeves
he hits the first note and takes his scotch down in one
a few of the old punters turn around
johnny starts to play the most beautiful classical music with his eyes shut
pete walks in approaches johnny and sits with him
he likes it when he plays
johnny doesnt even need to see him to know that hes there
you see that pack of virginia killing sticks at the end of the piano
we see the pack of cigarettes on the piano
pink revision a
all you need to know about life is retained within those four walls
pete picks up the pack as johnny keeps his eyes shut
the following story is a montage of pack shots of the cigarette box intercut with johnnys delicate fingers stroking the keys
you will notice that one of your personalities is seduced by the illusions of grandeur
a gold packet of king size and with a regal insignia
an attractive implication toward glamour and wealth a subtle suggestion that cigarettes are indeed your royal and loyal friends
and that pete
is a lie
beat your other personality is trying to draw your attention to the flip side of the discussion
written in boring bold black and white is the statement that these neat little soldiers of death are in fact trying to kill you
and that pete
is the truth
beat beauty is a beguiling call to death and i am addicted to the sweet siren of its pitch
you and i love the crack and that is also why i can not
give that painting back
he opens his eyes and looks at pete his cigarette has gone out
now please pass me a light
in mock awe oh you are something special johnny story
johnny smiles and puts him in a head lock they fall to the floor wrestling
one two and mumbles are here eating and holding their implements of destruction to be used on the next job we see the details
well use rock salt in the shot gun cartridges
slip em into the revolver if it starts getting large well bang a couple in to em and thatll slow em down
they wont know the difference between lead or salt and of course bobs driving
i dont want to use bob
hes our driver the a teams not complete without the driver
beat whats happened between you and bob
theres a bit of a pause
i think there might be something about bob you dont know mumbles
whats that then
that hes a poof
how did you know
everybody knows hes a flamer youre the only one who doesnt
he loves the boys
stunned what are you talking about i am losing orientation here mumbles

yes he fuckin did
ok so whats the problem
it was supposed to be his last night so you took care of him thats what friends do for one another well done i wont tell the chaps
hold on a minute you wont tell the chaps what
what did you do
stop right fuckin there
what is going on here
does that mean youve sucked his
well you must have touched him
i am not fucking gay
he wanted a dance thats all
did you give him one
we cut to a shot of one two dancing a slow dance with handsome bob who looks depressed
a dance yes i did
was it a slow dance
one two trails off
what has he done to me
i think theres something else you should know about our bob
what theres more
who do you think looked after your mum before she died whilst you were doing a two stretch
beat cos it wasnt fuckin me and i am your best pal
no it was bob around there six times a week without fail making sure she was looked after
you tore your mums heart out when you went away and bob did his best to put it back
pause i tell you something one two if i could be half the human that bob is and the price was being a poof id think about it
beat not for too long but id have to think about it
he looked after my mum how come he never told me
cos thats handsome bob and hes class
roman and mickey have got a band on stage and the place is filling up
roman is on the phone looking concerned as mickey looks on he puts the phone down
we cut to our band playing on stage modern young punksters arctic monkey types
plenty of attitude
there is a long line of people outside roman and mickeys venue
johnny and pete hustle their way through the crowd the bouncer pulls them up
oi you what do you think youre doing
what do you think were doing
were trying to get in
go home wasters costs money to get in here
yes my good man i am aware of that
johnny goes for his money but the bouncer pushes him on
whats wrong with you
get that archy on the phone i think weve got a problem
we cut to the band smashing away
the bouncer is holding johnny and pete back
run along junkies
oi looky but no touchy
johnny pushes the bouncers arm away
the bouncer retorts with a slap round the cheek
pete wont stand for that he goes for the bouncer in a pathetic junkie way
get off him you slag hes class
the bouncer smashes a big bouncer punch right on petes nose
pete shoots back past johnny and lays in the road the line starts clapping
roman is on the phone with archy we cut to them mid conversation
beat i hear you but you cant just shut us down
ive got an act on
johnny stands over pete he notices johnnys face
petes seen this before hes changing like a madmen about to explode
calm but worried leave it john im happy im all right down here mate

we hear the band is starting to get louder and faster
i understand well find him
still pleading but i have to keep the club open
i have four hundred people in here
beat dont you dare shut us down
johnny makes for the bouncer with menace the bouncer looks at johnny coming and smiles
fancy some more talent boy
johnny keeps coming hes tiny in comparison the bouncer stands and waits hes ready
johnny gives the old two finger poke to the eyes the bouncer screams in pain and swings into the ether pink revision a
we cut to the band who is going mad
johnny pulls out his signature pencils
i am going to report you whats your name
jog on boy before i grind your bones to make my bread
without a hesitation johnny sticks the pencils into the bouncers leg its quite nasty
the bouncer stumbles forward like a wounded elephant its david and goliath
johnnys smart he knows how to do this properly
oh im sorry did that hurt
here let me help you up
mickey walks back to roman
to roman theyre trying to shut us down
cut to the band going even madder the crowd is loving it
johnny picks up a trash bin lid and starts giving it to the bouncer
the crowd dances around this wounded beast
what was that about grinding bones
if we want to keep the licence and the lights on we need to find johnny story
mickey looks at the security camera and sees chaos
there is a revolution taking place outside
the band is still going when all of a sudden the lights get pulled we cut to black
pink revision a
roman and mickey have come to find cookie
he is with a group of people having dinner including fred the head
we cut into him mid joke
joke to be inserted by cookie
the table laughs roman and mickey approach
hello its roman and mickey what are you doing here boys

well you should be the first to know this but isnt he

beat come on cookie youve helped him fuck up his life for the last five years now do him a good turn
this story will be illustrated appropriately including a little smoking devil holding the burning crack
have you ever bought a ticket to the junkies bone yard roman
beat its an unpleasant place called curl up and die
might sound like a hair salon but it dont fuckin look like one i can tell ya
its a horrible sight and a terrible sound listening to a man sucking his soul through the hole in the pipe and even worse when he tries to tear it
beat ive been there ive done that
then i nailed that demon in a smoke proof coffin and i did it all with johnny
i love that man hes what you call class
and if you would use your heads you would love him too
you know his music sales have gone up a thousand percent in two weeks
beat you see johnny the crack head story knows that a rocka is worth more dead than alive silly world aint it
beat mr story doesnt get his gear from me he has to travel far and wide
leave me your number and if the dead feels like calling youll be the first to know
we see inside the range rover where there is a driver with our two chechnyans
the chechnyans have suitcases handcuffed to their wrists
they speak in their native tongue
victor is uris right hand man we served together for four years in chechnya
we used to have a good time together hes a real soldier strong hard we made much trouble
i saved his life and he saved mine many times
chechnyan pulls up his sleeve to reveal a massive tattoo
his arm is filled with slash marks on it
caught in tank tracks
he pulled me out and this one
he unbuckles his trousers and shows a massive gouge in his thigh
i have one of those
chechnyan pulls up his trouser leg to reveal massive scars on his shin
how many of these have you got
chechnyan pulls his shirt up to reveal more wounds
six thirty calibe
their car is smashed into a tailspin by handsome bobs truck
the range rover eventually lands on its side steam spinning wheels smoke and glass is everywhere
bob jumps out of his truck and runs down to the second getaway car waiting
we see one two and mumbles get out of their car and run over to the range rover on its side they are carrying an axe and bolt cutters
inside chechnyan slowly opens his dazed eyes to see an axe chopping through the window
two chops and the window gives in
one two leans in and grabs the case but its chained to chechnyan s wrist
one two pulls the arm out of the window and mumbles uses massive bolt cutters to cut the case free
theres another case grab it
one two leans in and grabs the second case from chechnyan
as he is about to chop this one loose he is pulled into the car by chechnyan
the bastards still kicking
mace him mace him
mumbles quickly moves around to the other window and sprays mace everywhere including into one twos eyes
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaa not me you idiot the guerrilla
chechnyan in the mean time has regained some of his strength and is still pulling one two into the car with him
we can see bob in the distance now next to their second getaway car looking concerned
shoot him shoot him the bastards going to eat me
mumbles pulls out a revolver sticks it in the window and fires it into chechnyan s leg
this just aggravates the white revision
in his arms
thats my fuckin arm
one two manages to head butt chechnyan and goes back to reclaiming the case from chechnyan
he pulls it out and mumbles cuts the chain
one two cant see a thing
lets go weve got it
give me a hand youve blinded me
major confusion is setting in
they run back to their car which is still running mumbles shoves one two into the back and jumps in the drivers seat
go go go go
with his window open mumbles wheel spins out of the situation and turns to check on one two
from out of nowhere a very large chechnyan arm shoots through the window and puts mumbles in a neck lock
the chechnyan is holding on and not letting go
the car tears across the road and enters a shop window that has a mezzanine
the car comes to a halt on a precarious ledge its dangling with the chechnyan still not letting go
give me the gun
one two can get a clear shot into the chechnyan s side
he shots him once chechnyan doesnt move twice three times four times he finally lets go and falls down on the floor
shit what are these two made out of
mumbles is coughing and slowly coming back to life
pink revision a
lets get going
i can hardly see where are we
grab my hand were getting out of here
whos got the cases
ive got em
as they get out of the car we see chechnyan has now made his way down the street
he is punch drunk with mace in his eyes but extracts a machine gun from under his jacket
the boys freeze they are fucked nowhere to go but chechnyan is blinking profusely he cant be sure where they are
he lets off a magazine into the manikins next to our boys who all hit the deck
the magazine runs dry chechnyan dips into his belt to extract a fresh one
mumbles sees his opportunity he grabs a golf club that is standing next to him runs at chechnyan and takes a massive swipe at his head
chechnyan goes down but he has already put in a new magazine
mumbles is still carrying the cases one two is attached to his arm
shoot him mumbles or we wont get out of this
i cant fuckin shoot him you do it
a baseball smashes into mumbles face he goes down and hes out
chechnyan has appeared carrying a metal baseball bat
one two picks up the machine gun
stop or ill shoot
chechnyan will not stop he just keeps on coming
i mean it get down
chechnyan keeps coming one two doesnt want to do it but he has to
he lets off twenty three bullets into the chechnyan s chest the chechnyan is knocked back and disappears over the mezzanine
one two is in shock he has never killed a man
he stands there numb
who has come back to life i got the cases now let go
pink revision a
one two is still in shock
now one two now
they make their way to the entrance
there is a crowd of people gathered a great ohhhhhhhh goes up
a car slowly makes it way through the crowd
it pulls up and the boys pile in whats left of them
they pull away from the sports shop
bob looks in his mirror he can see a gun being raised there is someone on the trunk
he slams on the brakes
chechnyan goes flying over the roof but stops himself hitting the road by perforating the hood with his massive knife
he proceeds to perforate the wind screen with another knife that he extracts and because of laminate starts to saw through the wind screen
the boys are in horror
one two gets caught in a head lock by chechnyan they struggle
mumbles hits the chechnyan from behind with a car jack and chechnyan goes down again
one twos eyes have just about come back
run for your lives
the crew split in different directions
bob takes the cases and plucks some poor bystander out of their car and takes off
mumbles disappears another way
chechnyan is up and follows one two terminator style a foot chase begins
one two split from the group and being pursued jumps over a wall
pink revision a
one two has ended up on a railway track
he turns back why should chechnyan chase him he hasnt got the money
but no chechnyan is over the fence bullet proof vest flapping in the wind and coming after him
one two finds his strength this is his world the world of the runner hes off down the tracks
the pair of them are bleeding profusely theyre bashed to a pulp but they have still got a running sprit
the run goes on and on
chechnyan has ripped off his jacket we can see his massive scar covered torso dripping in blood and sweat he seems unstoppable
one two gets confident and starts to run backwards egging chechnyan on chechnyan is a good runner but not good enough
deep hate fills his eyes as one two makes a fool out of him chechnyan will remember this man
one two is taking complete liberties he almost stops and waits until chechnyan has caught up to him and then he tears off the chechnyan keeps coming
one two sees in the distance a tiny moped approaching from a distance its chechnyan who completely out sizes the machine
however hes moving and its moving faster than one two
one two ducks off the tracks and over a wall the moped gets nearer
at least when he gets over the wall the moped wont follow right
one twos over
he can hear the moped on the other side one two looks over his shoulder he can see the moped being lifted over the wall
this is where one twos zone comes into play
he drifts in to a place that he can not be disturbed and he runs and runs and runs
up down through and in
we see mumbles has caught up with one two along side the tracks
he is on a motorbike that he has stolen
one two jumps on the back and they speed away leaving our chechnyans behind
we are on another one of uris construction sites lenny is here to do the money exchange again

one two walks into the restaurant with handsome bob
one two is bashed to a pulp but hes wearing a nice suit and carrying a bag full of money
there is a slight silence as his appearance arrests conversations
handsome waits near the entrance and one two sits down across from stella there is a pause
the odd person passes and double takes at one two

we observe one two looking for a reaction
you have very good taste
mr one two
she picks up the painting and turns smiling
with that she is off and out the door
one two grabs the s retro headphones above his head and slaps them on his ears
he presses the remote control and the music kicks in
mickey and roman approach the crack house door and flick up the letter box
they see a string hanging they pull it and down comes a key
roman and mickey walk in to see johnny slouched and watching tv more silly cartoons
hes got his top off and hes smoking a ciggy
his feet are resting on an old chair and pete is asleep next to him
johnny hardly moves
so why did you call johnny
sorry johnnys not home right now but the pipe is and the pipe says that johnny heard you were getting in trouble boys
roman gives a slight roll of the eyes
look whoever i am talking to please relay the message to johnny
his dad his jack in the box surprise gangster daddy paid us a visit
shut down a few of our venues and he intends to shut down a few more unless mr story puts in an appearance
why are you talking to a pipe roman
youre madder than i am
come back johnny come back home
but home is where your head is and i dont feel at home in my head
beat come back johnny
johnny smiles and pulls out a gun from under his arse
he points it at roman waits until he knows they feel it and pulls the trigger
its a lighter
he relights his splif hot hash dropping on his chest he ignores it
i bet our lenny gave you the im his old man speech didnt he
impersonating lenny ive seen jelly fish with closer dna than that slag
now johnny will come quietly but you might have a couple of problems with the pipe
he sighs come on boys buy us both a cup of tea
no need for any noise let pete sleep on
one two has still got the headphones on his eyes shut and hes tapping his knees
all of a sudden the music stops coming out of the headset and is now filling the room someone else is here
we cut back to an earlier scene that we werent a part of until now
pink revision a
victor is talking to a man we cant see who it is
uri is a man born with nothing carved his way up the hard way hes smart young and only one thing will stop him from reaching his goals
and this woman has become a problem
pause my job is to protect uri and in this department he needs protecting i dont like her or trust her and i want you to follow that snake
we reveal its chechnyan our war criminal who is looking battered from the beating the day before
leave it with me victor
we go back to the scene at the restaurant from a different perspective
the two chechnyans see one two and handsome bob walk out of the restaurant they two look at one another their brows steel
cut back to present with the music being cut off from one twos head phones
he opens his eyes on his throat lies a very long and sharp knife
the two chechnyans have entered the room and pulled the wire out of the machine
chechnyan is sitting on a chair next to one two hes the one with the blade
he smiles one two doesnt
archy approaches the door with danny behind he pushes it it opens
concerned he pulls out a shooter so does danny they go in
the music is very loud its russian
archy and danny make their way to its source up the stairs to the bedroom door
the base thumps out
archy tries the handle it turns he pushes the door open slowly
the music becomes clear as we reveal a horrible scene
archy is shocked but a little amused
tied to the bed back to front with a pillow over his head is one two
a large blade is resting on his back a bottle of vodka is open on the side one two cries and wriggles uselessly
pink revision a
on the floor facing the other direction is our pretty much naked chechnyan doing a traditional chechnyan dance which involves lots of extended leg action
he is wearing military speedos and fuck all else apart from his military hat
he is having much fun
his massive frame is still black and blue from the beating one two previously inflicted
the other chechnyan similarly dressed is digging into his bag of tools extracting all sorts of horrible looking things
archy looks on amazed by the show he has a quick look at danny who is also bemused
he hits the off button the chechnyans spin looking distressed
is this a bad time one two
unable to say anything emmm emmmmmmmmmmmm
shall we come back later
still unable to say anything emmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
the chechnyans make a quick move their last ever
we hear four shots ring out quickly
handsome bob and mumbles pull up and get out
handsome bob puts the paper work in his top pocket and bangs on the front door
one two is being wrapped up in a carpet on the floor
hes still emmmmmmmmming and wriggling
we hear handsome bob and mumbles at the front
one two its us
archy pays no attention to the door yet he is on the phone to lenny
bring em to the warehouse and dont hurt em until ive spoken to em all right
all right lenny i got a call waiting here ill see ya at the show
pink revision a
archy presses his phone to take the other call
roman and mickey are still here with johnny
archy leans against a rollsroyce with another heavy
young johnny walks up hes wearing tales and a bow tie hes with two of his toffy school friends
johnny you do look the part
show us your guns uncle arch i told the boys all about it
shut up and get in the car
archy throws johnny a packet of rolos and turns to get in the car
as he turns johnny lifts up the back of his sports jacket and steals his gun
the two friends are in shock needless to say so is archy
johnny holds it on his two friends
give us your money boys
archy grabs the gun and hits johnny on the back of the head not too hard
you little swine
now get in the car
archy puts the gun away and looks at the two shocked school friends
he gently slaps them on the cheek in an intimidating way and gives them a tener
be good boys you never know whos watching

lennys in a wheelchair he looks at bandy

bandy goes back to his position of pushing the boss towards the elevator
johnny roman and mickey walk toward the entrance
dont worry boys nothing to be nervous about some of my dads best friends ended up here
archy arrives with a couple of old carpets one two mumbles and handsome bob are wrapped inside
hello arch wrapped up in a carpet just like the old days

feigning fear dont hit me archy im a singer not a fighter

archy presses a button to call the elevator
i dont want to hear it
sorry thats right get into character
beat look at him boys scary aint he
roman and mickey dont like any of this
thats what four years inside does to a man eats his soul and when its all gone it makes a man quite scary
ever wondered how you got there
ever wondered what grass informed on you
the elevator arrives and they all pile in including the rugs with one two mumbles and handsome bob
a noise comes from one of the carpets
so who we got in there
anyone i know
thats right its only a job isnt it
just being loyal just following orders
pink revision a
johnny salutes i bet you can operate a nice gas shower
i can see you with a couple of ss on your collar and a stiff goose in your step
archy turns and slaps him the famous archy slap its nasty archys getting wound up
shut it otherwise you will get hurt
his face has been slapped into the direction of roman and mickey
johnny keeps his head still
that roman and mickey is the famous archy slap
i have been magically transported straight back to my childhood
he speaks next in a little boys voice hes taking the piss
dont turn archy in hes your friend hes loyal just like the dog
he changes to impersonate lenny its deep and over the top
shut up boy dont stick your nose where it dont belong otherwise ill chop it off
little boy voice but you cant do it to uncle arch i love him
deep needs a little lesson though dont he

a little time inside to remember who the boss is
archy straightens his tie to remain calm but cant take it any longer
he picks johnny up and slams him against the wall
shouting shut it you hear me or ill do ya myself you poisonous little fucker
feigning fear dont hurt me arch im only little
the elevator door opens and we see skinny johnny stuck up in the air held by archy
danny looks on a bit disturbed
put him down arch hes only little
archy drops him his wires crossed
he needs a little time to think
johnny is off out of the elevator walking away happy as a clam
back to archy in the elevator
you all right
you look a little green
back to business fine roll out the carpets
johnny comes bowling in like a rocknrolla coming on to stage
he spots lenny
archy comes in with danny and the carpets handsome bob hears this is lenny cole the sidney shaw
sorry about the painting needed the cash for a little bit of the old dusty show bizzzzzzzz
beat so its gone now lost in the world of degenerate and stoned no hopers never to be seen again by the eye of a clean soul
there is a pause while lenny considers just shooting him
he changes his tone he gets serious and slow
tell me what are you boy if you are not poison
look what youve left behind you
your dad couldnt even bear the sight ya no wonder he fucked off and left me to pick up the pieces but that wasnt enough for you was it
no had to drive your mum into a bottle of pills and house full of nutters
all she got then was a hot bath a ice cold razor why
beat cos your poison johnny thats why
what can i say
pause im a junkie crack head no gooder should never have wasted your money on that school
archy get him out of here
ive had enough of him i dont trust myself
beat use someone else
johnny grabs the back of lennys chair and pushes him around like hes a two year old lenny feels a right twit
one two handsome bob and mumbles observe
its a gathering i love a gathering look mumbles one two handsome bob all the old faces today
beat its all going so well apart from archy whos ruining the day
i tried to cheer him up with that story about how you grassed him u
lenny shoots johnny in the hip with a gun he has kept hidden
everybody is shocked danny jumps back in horror that was pretty close
all right calm down give me that ill take care of him
danny moves in to take the gun from lenny
johnny speaks in pain but still chipper
that wasnt one of your better shots was it now daddy
if you want to shut me up it should have been a bit higher
lenny looks up to danny
pink revision a
quietly danny come here i want him taken care of you hear
now get him out
danny takes roman mickey and johnny out towards the elevator
you dont know how much trouble you have caused me so please understand that i will kill you very slowly if you do not tell me where my money is
the address is in my top pocket
you know i wouldnt mess you around
lenny is out of reach of them archy can tell handsome bob is implying something
take it arch
archy leans forward to take it lenny interrupts wheeling himself over
let me have a look first
he takes the letters out of handsome bobs top pocket and opens them up
he squints the print is too small he cant read what it says
here you cant read it without your glasses let me have a look
lenny looks uncomfortable archy almost snatches the letters and flicks through the pages
he reads to himself could it be true
could lenny be the informer sending everyone around him down
what does it say
mickey and roman are holding johnny up hes bleeding all over the place
danny is facing front while another man is keeping an eye on them
we see but the others dont danny is slowly screwing on a silencer
dont worry just yet fellas nothings going to happen while were standing in the elevator because they dont pink revision a
want to have to drag the three corpses across to the cars that would be hard work
in about two minutes from now when were all driving along happily
danny boy is going to turn around and pop me two in the head and one in throat just to make sure
beat and then since danny is obviously going to kill you two as well
we see the imaginary shots from dannys gun go off on mickey and roman
we cut back to the scene upstairs
you wanna know what this says len
beat funny thing with the law it can be quite flexible
every time an informer finds himself in front of a judge
we see archys story acted out in the full court room law and order style
the judge and lawyer act out archys words
a secret letter stands witness as to the cooperation and efficiency of that informer
an accurate record of his treachery will be brought in to protect the informer
back to our present scene
pink revision a
if the informer has provided adequate information that dog of dogs will be magically released
back to our acted out scene
a sort of get out of jail free card but this comes along with the trail of a good alibi
archy turns the pages of the letter
we see different judges giving different sentences to different faces some of these faces we know one of them is fred the head handsome bob and one of them is
still being acted out in law and order style
the only evidence that will ever remain of this deal is that form of a very exclusive and hard to come by legal document called a secret debt
back to our present scene
as in deputation
beat the likes of which i hold for the very first time in my hand
beat of course they use a false name and i have seen that name many times in the last twenty years always did wonder who sidney shaw was
flashback twenty years ago archy picking up papers on lennys desk and turns to him
whos this sidney shaw len
bothered give us that here
pink revision a
lenny has gone white
no i am being set up
youre a dirty bastard sidney a very dirty bastard
archy grabs the belt thats used to tie up drowning victims he throws it round lennys chair and stuffs a bit of cloth into lennys wide open mouth
to one two handsome bob and mumbles you three cut yourself free and get out of here
archy throws a knife across to mumbles who just catches it and starts to cut his way out of the ropes
archy gets back on with the job at hand
he reads through the names lenny has grassed on over the years
michael finny ten years
frazier nash fifteen years
cousin ronnie six years
you dirty bastard
beat michael dexter eight years
archy grabs the winch that lowers victims to their crayfish death and bangs it on to the back of the wheel chair
he presses the start button and the wheelchair is raised with haste
the jew twins fourteen years and of course me archy four years
one two mumbles and handsome bob are free
see ya arch
the three of them are out like rats up ropes they start to run down the stairs
we pick up where we left off with this group
shouldnt have brought me here fellas youre just going to end up as witnesses
pink revision a
we continue with his description of what is going to happen
after they have dealt with us theyre gonna put all three of us in the trunk of a stolen car
we see six gallons of petrol in the trunk of the car in our imaginary scene
and pour six gallons of petrol on top i can let your imagination fill in the rest
back to present
but now dannys rattled he wont be able to wait because you now know whats coming so hes gonna fire
danny who is now in a state because johnny has predicted everything hes going to do suddenly turns with his gun
mickey catches it the force of the stop pulls the trigger and the other mans head is drilled through
roman joins the wrestling match and gets the gun and wrist to aim at dannys head
the trigger gets squeezed and dannys head also gets a drilling
johnny who is smothered in blood speaks coolly
mickey pass me the gun
mickey is out to lunch but johnny sounds commanding
mickey quickly pass me that gun in dannys hand
dont worry he cant defend himself he doesnt have a head quickly now
does this answer the question that you two so frequently asked as to why i sought refuge in the depths and perverse beauty of the crack pipe
the elevator door opens
pink revision a
there stands bandy his gun drawn
get fucking down
he looks on in horror and points the gun at johnny
just as hes about to fire
there is a great smash of bone on timber
bandy falls to reveal one two standing there with a large piece of timber
i think we should get out of here now dont you john
at which point in the background we see lenny being lowered to his demise
he looks at the group in horror as he is quickly lowered to his death by drowning and cray fish
i dont like it uri i dont trust her
i put two of my people on her and they havent come back
i did not tell you to do this
if i had wanted her spied on i would have asked for it wouldnt yes uri you would have but i still dont like it
i dont care what you like victor i am in charge now wait here
he gets out and walks to the door
she answers the door she is surprised
can i come in
pink revision a
sorry to surprise you but i have something for you a token of my appreciation
he hands her a check
what is this for
please do not be insulted you have come to mean a lot to me and i value you much more than just your services
pause this is simply a reflection of my appreciation
vulnerable he likes her i would like to ask you something personal
his phone rings he frowns slightly and answers it
not now victor i am busy
there casually resting on the floor is his painting his lucky painting
uris expression changes his world has been shattered hes thinking very ugly thoughts
he turns back to stella dead pan
a very nice painting
how long have you had it
a little caught off guard
years its my lucky painting
its very special isnt it
beauty is a cruel mistress is it not
pause she smiles
uri talks back into the phone the other darker uri is now in charge
victor please come to join us
