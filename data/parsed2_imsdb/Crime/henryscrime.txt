written by sacha gervasi a lone toll booth attendant sits inside his glass box on an empty stretch of interstate
this is henry
he looks out at the horizon
its starting to get light out
theres snow on the ground
hes neither asleep nor awake
henrys plastic gloves unscrew a thermos pour coffee into a styrofoam cup
there are only a few drops left
henry straightens slides open his window
but the car veers over to the automated ez pass lane
henry closes the window watches the car disappear
he downs the last of his coffee looks back out at the horizon again
its cloudy out there
henry packs up his thermos puts on his coat and steps out into the icy morning
he walks toward his truck
the traffic is beginning to build
henrys old ford pick up drives past the enormous abandoned central train terminal
the pick up turns down toward a neighborhood of modest salt box houses
henrys truck rolls into his driveway
hangs up his down jacket on a row of hooks
its clean and ordinary in here
his wife debbie is in the kitchen
shes wearing a nurses uniform
henry notices the dining room table set for one for breakfast
eggs bacon sausage
hes a little surprised
lays down the toast
starts buttering the toast
he digs in
how was your night
how was yours
shes still buttering the toast
she sets it down
this is great
she sits down next to him
watches him eat
your shifts at eight thirty
you not eating
i already did
he takes another bite
are you coming with me to cindy and bills on saturday
for the baby shower
she just stares at him
well i dont want to go to cindy and bills
i mean i want cindy and bill to come here
cindy and bill are welcome here anytime
isnt it time
isnt it time for us
henry stops eating
youre talking about kids
of course i am
okay you want kids
i love kids
he looks down resumes eating
he looks up again
do you still love me
hes still as a stone
of course i do
she looks at him
because i know you did once
a very long pause
henry doesnt do anything now
what happened henry
he just sits
henry gets up heads to the door
debbie watches him go
outside on the step there are two men in softball uniforms
one of them is puking
behind them two more guys sit in the back of the car
henry recognizes the smiling pock marked face of eddie vibes
two parts charm one part menace
his puking friend is joe
so how you doin man
whats going on
listen i got a man down here
eddie glances up and down the street
mind if we come in for a second
eddie and henry watch while debbie attends to the sick joe bits of puke still clinging to his softball uniform
she touches his forehead
he starts to retch
holding it in im sorry
you better come with me
eddie glances at henry as debbie leads him expertly toward the bathroom
goddamn sausage at pinwheels
so were in a little bind henry
got league playoffs in a half hour and joes our first baseman
and hes not exactly game ready as you can see
eddie stares at him
so what do you say
what do i say what
you feel like playing a little ball
filling in for joe
they keep the field in perfect shape
so what do you say
henry looks around the room
for a moment he watches debbie with joe in the bathroom the door half open
shes tending to him caring for him
debbie looks up
sees henry staring at her
he wears joes too small softball uniform
eddie rides shotgun the other two in the back
they grimly stare out the windows
appreciate you driving man
so wheres this game
like fifteen minutes
the car turns a corner on to main street
pull up right over here
we gotta grab some beer money at that atm
the car pulls up to a row of stores including the first eddie pats henrys shoulder
just hang tight
well be right back
eddie and the guys get out
henry notes this is strange
after a moment henry realizes something stinks
he sniffs his sleeve
in the rearview henry doesnt notice eddie and the two guys slipping on ski masks
a pet store owner rolls up the security gates of his store and enters
he says good morning to all the animals
its a strange one man show
henry startles looks back to where the sounds coming fly out of the bank on the corner and scatter in various directions
theyre all wearing softball uniforms
a bank guard chases them
on henry confused
a second bank guard frank s african american is crossing the street toward the bank with two coffees
he sees whats going on drops the coffees and pulls his gun you
henry turns forward again
is pointing at him through the windshield
henry slowly raises his hands off the wheel
frank sucks his teeth his gun trained on henry as the distant sound of blaring sirens grows louder
holding on henrys stunned expression
henry sits at a small table as a detective whose face we never see paces back and forth
henry we know this wasnt your deal
henry just listens
all you have to do is give me those names
and you can go home
its that simple
henrys still silent
why are you sticking up for these people
theyre not your friends
youve got a wife
youve got a job
dont you care
all you have to do is say something
henry looks up at him making eye contact for the first time
in light of the fact that this is a first offence
henry stands in a suit flanked by his state appointed attorney
debbie sits in the gallery
a judge stares at henry
the court sentences henry torne to four years in prison for the crime of felony st degree armed robbery
the gavel goes down
he looks at his lawyer who is pleased with the sentence
he pats henry well done
henry looks back at debbie
shes just staring at him
a cell door is slammed shut
henry wearing a prison jumpsuit watches as the guard locks the door in front of him
whatre you in for
i said what are you in for
max s pulls up his pants flushes the toilet
i like it
henry just watches
but i didnt do it
goes to the sink
washes his hands
a perennial favorite
identities are just constructs anyway
theyre mistaken all the time
he dries his hands
presents one of them to henry
make yourself at home
henry sits down on his bed
what are you in for
its starting to hit henry
dont worry youll get used to it
all the cell doors slam open
henry startles awake
max is already dressed
we gotta go
a guard seeing henry still in his bunk bangs his baton against the bars of the cell
max and henry move along a line of convicts waiting for their food
monday is whole wheat bun day
henrys lost in thought
what are you thinking about
youre thinking something
let me guess
youre thinking how did i get here
henry puts out his tray
how do you think any of us got here
im not sure
ill tell you how
because we committed crimes
but we committed to the wrong thing
you see that was our mistake
we didnt fulfill our potential we got angry and we took it out on other people
a bald tattooed gang banger walks right past them to a table
he wanted to be a doctor
he couldve been but he chose not to fulfil his potential he chose not to commit to his dream
and now look at him
bad choices see
by the way i recommend the potatoes
max and henry sit down at one of the long tables
thats the real crime henry
not committing to your dream
they begin to eat
so whats yours
not sure i ever had one
never had a dream
what kind of a life is that
i dont know
a pretty good one
henry youre in jail
henry thinks about that
puts a piece of potato in his mouth
max and henry walk through the crowded prison yard
but heres the good news
we got all this time to do
and time is a medium of exchange
you can buy things with it
and in your case you can figure out what your dream is
max takes his arm your dream is your truth is your destiny
henry looks at him
i told you
im here by mistake
max shoots a look back at him
there are no mistakes
max suddenly glimpses some activity over henrys shoulder
several convicts are making their way towards them
he pulls henry close his tone suddenly intense but youre going to have to fight for that dream henry
youre at a crossroads now
there are going to be tests
henrys punched in the side of the head
the inmates grab him throw him to the ground next to max
this is your moment
whatever you do now defines you
go get em
henry gets up charges the inmates arms swinging taking several down
he gives it everything hes got
they pile into him pummeling him
henry just keeps fighting
but its hopeless
guards rush in
henry lies on his bunk his face battered and bruised
you did good henry
i dont feel good
youre doing better than you feel
henry touches his swollen eye
go to sleep henry
sleep is for the blessed
one by one we see lights blinking off across the vast string of cells
henrys wife debbie sits at one of the metal visiting tables
shes dressed up
shes really made an effort
a door opens henry appears
he looks different
some time has passed
he smiles walks over
you look beautiful
how are you doing
how about you
i have something i need to talk to you about
i fell in love
henry takes that in
i mean it just happened
im sorry henry
youre not mad
he looks at her
i want you to be happy
you too henry
no one moves
henry sits on a bench alone processing what just happened
he looks up at the sky
gray and empty
max arrives sits down next to henry carefully puts a hand around his shoulder
i ever tell you i was married
henry turns to him
i mean nearly
i had a lovely correspondence going with jocelyn steinberg in utica
problem was when she finally came on visitors day she said i was too short
books and covers
books and covers
theres music on a radio
pull back to reveal henry sitting on his bunk
hes grown a beard
their cell has temporarily been converted into a makeshift barbershop
convicts of various races wait to get their hair cut by max the barber
max holds up a mirror to his customer fink
clean as a whistle
checking himself out max i think you missed your calling
who do we got next henry
henry checks the schedule by his side calls out a name
standing just outside a guard watches the make shift barbershop carefully
hector takes his seat
max wraps a sheet around his neck
when are you up for parole
show us what you did for the board last time
the other inmates egg him on
leave me alone
max finally puts his clippers down
all right so im sitting there and the head of the board asks me what im going to do if they let me out this time
maxs face starts to shudder
his shoulders jerking back a little bit
i get this twitch
and then i give him my answer im gonna break in your house set your dog on fire eat all your food go on a naked rampage through your garden
dance in the streets of your lil hometown like a crazed harpee hurl myself headlong flaming through the ethereal sky like gods blackest angel and explode like a goddamn heavenly fireball
eyes ablaze and face beetroot red and twitching like a mad man
you dont want me
you dont want this
not out there
the inmates look slightly scared
max casually picks up his clippers and smiles believe me im not going anywhere
they crack up
hey white shadow
whens your review coming up
you gonna do the twitch like your cellie
what you dont like it around here
everyone knows henrys innocent
the board dont like it when you deny the crime
i didnt do the crime
hey but you got the time
so you may as well have done it
i like it
you got the time so you may as well have done the crime
everyone laughs again
now thats funny henry
yeah youre right
alot of noise and steam
henry and max at the end of a row
you know you never did tell me what your dream was max
im living it
its easier to live in here
you dont have to do anything
you just show up
in fact they even do that for you
im living the life
this place is horrible max
max thinks lathering his hair
so why didnt you just say something
when you had the chance
when you were still innocent
i thought maybe this was my way out
and was it
there are no mistakes
its early morning
henrys clean shaven dressed in street clothes
he packs the last of his things into a sports bag zips it up
looks over at max whose eyes are closed
max looks vulnerable like a child the coverlet pulled right up to his neck
you got everything kid
henry silent for a moment
maybe you should think about getting out of here sometime
ill buy you a cup of coffee on the outside
the only thing ive ever missed in twenty three years is a hot bath
and that aint worth walking out of here for
the cell door slides open
henry starts to leave
your dream is your myth is your truth
i thought it was my dream is my truth is my destiny
stops at the door
im going to miss you
i hope i never see you again
im still gonna miss you
get out of here henry
henry walks through the front gate of the prison
he takes a long deep breath of free air
we see his exhale
he starts to walk
henry sits in the back of the bus the new york countryside streaking past him in a blur
henry turns onto his old street
henry walks up to his doorway
he hesitates before ringing the bell
the door opens
its the guy who got sick several years before
hes wearing a suit and tie now
how you doing
come on in
make yourself at home
his old house looks more or less the same
joe heads over to small display of kitchenware samples in the living room
dont mind me
im just getting set up for my meeting
you want a beer
honey do mind getting henry a beer
as joe clips several flow charts onto an easel they look like they were done by a kid debbie appears with a bud lite
she hands it to henry
its not so awkward
debbie leads henry to a navy bag and a box with henrys name on it
i think thats everything you wanted
they just stand there for a moment
are you happy
i am henry
he means it
henry picks up the box shoulders the bag
so what are you going to do now
i dont know yet
honey theyre starting to arrive
joe grabs a display stand featuring kitchen products
were having a meeting
its his new business
hey maybe youd be interested henry
you could become a distributor for jin chi
they all head out of the garage
its korean kitchenware
the future of food storage
plus if you recruit distributors you get paid even more
passing through the living room arriving guests notice henry walking out carrying his box
you mean like a pyramid scheme
its a multi layered marketing paradigm
anyway why dont you give it some thought
henry nods starts to head out
listen i just wanted to thank you
for not giving up my name
i dont know your name
sure you do
youre welcome joe
ill see you deb
take care of yourself henry
henry walks down the street with his box
a neighbor approaches recognizes him
how are you
henry looks over
how are you
how was greece
debbie told us all about your trip
i was in prison
a shitty apartment
the tv is on low
henry sits on a chair by the bed the box between his legs its contents spread out over the bed
photographs of a long forgotten vacation in puerto rico with debbie
a baseball glove
a high school year book
inside a page of senior photos
he finds his own picture smiling at the thresh hold of adulthood
underneath his name it reads most nicest he studies the image a moment flips to the inner cover graffitied with hand written messages from classmates including henry dont be such
a fag eddie vibes henry puts the yearbook back in the box
next to it are a pile of photographs spread out
images from henrys childhood
of him and debbie
of different times
he finishes putting everything back
a distinctive jingle
on the tv
henry looks over
an ad for the local buffalo lottery a pretty young blonde in a sequinned dress speaks to the camera
take a chance on life take a chance on buffalotto
henry closes the lid of the box regards it
henry sits at a desk
hes handed a cup of coffee by his female parole officer whose face we never actually see
re the coffee is it okay
henry takes a sip
so what do you think
about building your life from the ground up
a grass field
henry steps into frame with a shovel
behind him an older man in a cap pushes a wheelbarrow
from a low angle we watch as henry digs
hes a few feet down
the wheelbarrowman still watches silently
henry lies on his bed staring up at the ceiling
his mind turns
hes starting to think
the sound of the buffalotto jingle on the tv
the wheelbarrowman watches silently as henry digs another small ditch
henry sits in the back row
we watch him as he eats popcorn
the movie flashes across his face
there are guns involved
a cloudy spring day
henry climbs out of the ditch
throws down his shovel and shakes the wheelbarrowmans hand
he walks away past rows of graves
he notices a flower poking through the dirt
the female parole officer sets down a cup of coffee
we still dont see her face
she sits down at her desk
seems like yesterday you walked through that door
henry youve done your time
you are now a free free man
how does it feel
henry takes a breath
she signs a document and hands it to him
so whats next
henry doesnt answer
the sound of boots move in on henrys expression staring as we henrys dirty boots march along the street with purpose
we follow them
after a while the boots stop
henry looks up we travel around him see what he sees directly across the street
holding on henry as he contemplates the place
henry takes a deep breath
theres something happening hes not sure what it is
an idea perhaps an instinct that somehow with each passing moment becomes more like a knowing
a moment of revelation
he starts across the street toward the bank moving now heading right toward the front door transfixed as the sound drops out and he begins to smile a car hits
henry in the side
hes knocked down
a girl s rushes out of the car
what are you doing
what the fuck are you doing
are you okay
into cell phone stan
i gotta call you back
i just ran someone over
no he looks okay
she hangs up
you idiot you werent even looking where you were going
are you okay
henrys a little delirious
i think im okay
he grabs his thigh
winces with pain
tries to get up
stay on the ground
the bank guard frank rushes over
is he alright
dont get up
ill call an ambulance
starts to stand i think im okay
to frank confused is he alright
are you alright
he just walked right out into the street
he came out of nowhere
i saw the whole thing
you were on the phone
you werent even paying attention
i know how to drive
cars are honking now as henry limps his way over to the sidewalk
what are you doing
get back on the ground
park your car
im going to take him into that cafe
she jumps back in her car and pulls it over to the side
frank comes over to henry takes his arm
they let you out huh
lets get you a seat in here
frank sets henry down in a chair at one of the tables by the door
une verre deau
julie comes in
did you call an ambulance
im calling an ambulance
i really am fine
hes alright for a guy who just got run over
sucks his teeth lucky i guess
i think we should call a doctor
henry just stares at her
for a long moment
are you okay
he keeps staring
are you okay
do you need a doctor
you look familiar
it takes julie a moment
take a chance on life take a chance on buffa lotto
oh thats why
an awkward moment
well i guess you seem to be okay
so youre okay
so i can go now
and be more careful
he watches her go
anything else i can get you
hobbles down the hallway
he notices the photos on the wall
a series of historical shots of old buffalo
his eyes drift to the photos on the wall to his right
he zeroes in on a prohibition era newspaper framed front a photo of cops in trench coats posing in front of the the sound of henrys pee stops
he takes a step closer to the next urinal over
reads the rest of it
a cop in a tunnel smiling as he points up to a hole after a moment henry starts peeing again
thinking about what hes just read
henry comes out
stares at the bank across the street
looks both ways and then crosses the road
henry stands in the back alley behind the bank feeling the place out
his head turns between the back door of the bank and the back of the building opposite
then looks down at his feet
he looks up again notices the
he goes over to it
henrys still in his clothes lying on his bed his mind reeling the tv on low
he gets out of bed
puts his foot in his boot
youve got a visitor
henry sits at a visitors table waiting
a moment passes a door clanks open and emerges with a guard
i thought i told you i didnt want to see your face again
nice to see you too
he goes to hug him
they look at each other a moment
i figured it out
what is it
henry leans in
the bank is your destiny
the one i didnt rob
but you went to jail for it
what are you talking about henry
henry looks around
closer i did the time i may as well have done the crime
i still dont get it
i need your help
to rob the bank
so what do you say
im in jail
thats what i say
youve got your review coming up so
so you can get of here
if you want to
its not as simple as that
yes it is
no its not
no its not
im happy here
this is my home
this is not a home
this is a prison
whatever you want to call it im happy here
henry looks at max now
he looks frail
you cant die in this place
i can die wherever i want
you really want to die here
what do you want henry
im asking for your help
to rob that bank
ive thought about it
its the right thing
for both of us
a long beat
max gets up henry
i got cards
great to see you kid
henry stares at the bank again
then walks down mecca road glimpses the marquee of the orpheum theatre
darek millodragovics the cherry orchard by anton henry approaches takes in the large photo of darek and the play poster featuring a tree for the upcoming each tree branch of
this poster dangles a small cherry shaped photo of the various actors starring in it including julie ivanova the girl who ran henry over as madame ranevsky
a black and white american flag wrapped around the trunk of the cherry tree with bloody roots
henry regards this with some interest tries the theatre door
this ones open
henry enters the lobby
the light is low
theres something almost magical about this place
henry hears voices drifting in from the main theatre as he continues to walk heading toward the sounds
as madame ranevsky is it really me sitting here
i want to dance and clap my hands
henry enters the back of the theatre
sees the girl on
the girl who hit him with her car
shes in mid speech as madame ranevsky i think i must be dreaming
god knows i love my country
i love it deeply
i couldnt see out the train window i was crying so much
i must drink my coffee
thank you firs thank you you dear old man
im so glad to find you still alive
arnold regional actor extraordinaire plays lophakin your brother leonid andreyevich says im an upstart
a money grubber
marching to and fro he can say whatever he likes
i dont care a bit
he chews up the scenery
i just want you to believe in me like the old days
i just want your wonderful tender eyes to look at me like they did stop
darek the czech director greasy haired balding and smoking stands up in his seat in the stalls
too small too safe
stop showing me your safe face but i was not you
youre doing the best you can
he points to julie
what are you doing
you look like youre hearing
to hear is to be weak
to listen is to be strong
to listen is an action
julie cocks her ear mockingly
darek marches up to her
what is that
is this what you mean darek
is this what you want
then what do you want
they stare each other down
i want you to be more
i want you to be better than that
he snatches the cup from her hand
now go drink coffee
and dont think about what i want think about what you want
ill go drink coffee
julie marches off stage
ill go drink coffee too
lets all go drink coffee
ten minutes everyone
to his eastern european olga
coffee for everyone
well all have coffee djula
every single one of us
and think about what we want
watches as julie comes up the aisle
she notices him
what are you doing here
she doesnt wait just walks right past
are you here to sue me
then what are you doing here
i saw your picture outside
the door was open
i came in
henry catches up
she crosses the street ignoring the traffic
is it always like that
gesturing back to the that
you mean rehearsal
its a process
its all pain
they reach the cafe
he opens the door for her i thought you were listening
she looks at him curiously
im henry by the way
she points at henry
you want one
they stand right there at the bar
henry notices the play poster on the wall over her shoulder
looks at it
then back at her
comparing her photo to the live person
she turns to see what hes looking at
so what do you think
doesnt look like you
no i meant the poster
actors on a tree is funny
pierre puts the coffees down on the bar
thats the directors joke
she starts dropping cubes of sugar in her cup
hes making a comment on the american culture
actors faces as falling fruit
birth death the consumption of the id
to him the american dream has become the worlds nightmare
you are the country of apocalypse
thats what he told us on the first day of rehearsal anyway
the irony is he loves the american dream
i mean thats why hes here right
but i know for a fact he hates himself for loving it
its always an inside job isnt it
but the truth is i wasnt listening
i was playing it safe
he was right
about that anyway
she drinks her coffee
you know the cherry orchard was chekhovs last play
he was dying when he wrote it
its my last play too
here in buffalo
she downs the last of her coffee
right after were done
im glad you came by
thanks for not suing me
ill see ya
he watches her through the glass as she walks across the street
right past the bank on her way back to the theatre
maxs cell door opens
he walks happy and confident this morning
hey barber tomorrow lunch right
give em hell
i always do felipe
as max reaches the end of the walkway an old guard opens the next steel door for him
here we are again
hows your grandson
just started first grade
the socialization begins
the guard smiles as he leads him toward the parole board room at the end of another long corridor
they stop at the door
how many more of these you think you got in you max
as many as it takes
the guard shakes his head opens the door for him
a parole board officer is reading maxs file as he enters
good afternoon mr
take a seat
the officer gestures to the chair
the other members of the board stare at max
the head parole officer leafs through page after page of denied applications
max watches the pages turning the years of his life going by taking it in
could you please tell the board why you believe we should grant you parole
they all wait for maxs answer
come on mr
saltzman what have you got for us this time
closer on max
he looks like he might start to twitch at any moment
the gigantic prison gates clank open
max emerges a tiny figure against the imposing facade
hes holding a small black valise
looks like it was made in the s
max looks a little less sure of himself
i knew you could do it
max looks around nervously
wheres the car
i dont have a car
you dont have a car
whats wrong with you
you came to pick me up without a car
thats not picking a person up
yes it is
im picking you up
i dont know about this
maybe this is a mistake
walks back towards the gates
starts to pound on them
max its okay
takes maxs bag
come on max
i dont like this
take it easy
theres nothing to be frightened of
the bus stations just a short walk
max starts to hyperventilate
i cant breathe
i cant breathe
henry hesitates a moment puts an arm around him
youre going to be alright
nearly on his knees im going to die right here
i told you
come on max were going to miss that bus
henry helps max back up again
a greyhound bus rumbles through the countryside
henry and max sit up front right next to the driver
max has his eyes closed
he still looks woozy
he opens his bag and pulls out a sandwich
offers it to him
max doesnt say anything
max opens one eye
henry opens the door for max
here we are
henry indicates the tiny bed in the corner of the living room
there are some second hand books on the bedside table like future shock by alvin toffler and dostoyevsky
that ones yours
max goes over looks at the books
sits down on the bed
anything else you need
max reclines in the steaming tub luxuriating in the warm water
he closes his eyes takes a deep breath and relaxes
after a moment he notices a fancy looking bottle on the side
reads the label ah
the land of milk and honey
pours it into his bath
as they cross a street max notices a coffee shop on the other side
what is this obsession with coffee henry
when did that happen
im not sure max
but it seems to give people a lot of purpose
they walk into the cafe orpheum
henry looked at earlier when he was pissing
max is staring at the thing now too
oh my god
are you kidding
this was eighty years ago
oh my god
that tunnels probably not even there anymore
are you dreaming henry
its a start
this was your plan
an old cartoon in a pissoir
its an article
why dont we just go in with guns and do it the old fashioned way
someone could get hurt
thats sweet kid
the tunnel photo maybe its still there max
maybe it is
max looks at him
first things first
why dont we go take a look at this bank of yours
at least we know thats still there
henry looks at him
max and henry walk in to the grand banking hall
money is a mistress with a hard heart
observes max and henry
henry glances over at him too
frank watches them as they walk toward the cashier
id like to speak to your manager please
im interested in opening an account
a name placard howard tuttle assistant manager
and which kind of account would you like to open
sitting in front of his desk
what kind do you have

he said that vault will be there for three hundred years
we hope hes right
he was never wrong

its all about history
as i was saying
we have savings
commercial youll have to give us some time to think about which one
max gets up
youve been very helpful
henry and max walk out past frank
he watches them leave
have a nice day gentlemen
max and henry stand in the alley
henry touches the back of the bank wall
the vault is here
he walks across the alley
the tunnel runs under here
he follows it toward the back door of the theatre
and ends up somewhere in there
he turns to max
its virtually robbing itself
the door hits the back of his head as it swings open
goddamn czech chekhov shit
she storms out punches the air screams suddenly notices max and henry standing there
rubbing his head hi
she looks at max
what are you doing here
oh we were you know i was just showing henry the place i used to perform
henry shoots max a look
the door opens
simon the stage manager pokes his head out
thats lunch julie
chekovs tough stuff
it takes a steel stomach

apart from gorbachev hes my favorite russian
max approaches her
would you mind if we took a look around
its been over thirty years since ive been inside
she considers the request
she gestures them inside
come on in
as henry passes how you doing
im in hell
max walks to centre stage front like hes been there before
he looks out at the auditorium a little emotional all of a sudden
so what productions were you in
shakespeare ibsen mahoney the greats
and the not so greats
mary wants to fit your wig at four
darek says to stay hungry
max and henry exchange a glance
would it be a tremendous imposition to have a little tour for old times sake
he used to perform here
i dont see why not
were on a break
that okay henry
julie and henry watch them go
is that your dad
hes a friend
he seems like your dad
henry walks out onto the stage where max was standing getting the feel of it
its peaceful out here
is it fun
pretending to be other people
its not really like that
i dont pretend to be someone else
i find some part of me and reveal it in a new way
just inside of a character
so in a way youre still playing you
in a way
so what part of you are you playing now
thats the question you always have to ask yourself
max follows simon through a tight hallway of dressing they pass actors eating lunch or playing cards
nothing very glamorous
ah the inner sanctum
the magic before the magic
i remember it like it was yesterday
they enter the green room where arnold is holding court
people often make the mistake in chekhov of going down
but you must always always go up
other actors look at him with blank faces
max gestures simon closer
with a conspiratorial whisper simon did you know there used to be a speakeasy down here during prohibition days
and they hid the booze in the bank
and there was a tunnel too
where was it
henry examines the fake bookshelves on the drawing room set
julie sits in an armchair eating the sandwich shes pulled out of her bag
she watches him a moment
so whats your story henry
i mean like
what do you do
henry crosses the stage goes to sit in the chair opposite her
im figuring that out
does that mean you dont have a job
i just got out of jail
she wasnt expecting that
sounds worse than it is
jail sounds bad
why were you in there
she takes a big bite of her sandwich
are you a murderer or something
do i look like one
she studies him
what do i look like
she studies him some more
i dont know
dead serious yeah
a taped paper sign on the door reads lophakin please knock
simon opens it for max shows him inside
we got to be quick
arnold doesnt like people in his dressing room
a costume on hangers
a wig and beard in front of the mirror
simon walks into the room
places his hand on the far wall
it was right here
max comes up
feels it now too
booze broads and lucre
the good old days
i like it
they filled it in in when they built the theatre
max pads the wall like its a good old friend testing it
times have changed
all good things must come to
he hits a hollow spot an end
turns to simon and with a broad smile do you need volunteers
henry picks up a marked up text of the cherry orchard thats on one of the chairs
the cherry orchard
leafing through it so what happens
whats it about
is it funny
julie gets up out of her chair
a woman returns to her family estate in the russian countryside and realizes she has no choice but to sell her beloved cherry orchard the magical place of her youth
the only place she ever felt safe
i guess its not funny
she looks at him
its about being forced to let go of the past and create a new life in order to survive
maxs voice booms that was great
this place is full of treasures
max comes right up to them
thank you julie
and thank you simon
ill see you tomorrow
max has very kindly offered to volunteer at the theatre
henry lets get out of these peoples way
henry turns to julie
what are you doing after rehearsal
do you like chinese
they look at each other as actors return to the stage
darek moves towards his place in the front seats
its time to work americans
even you djula
max grabs henry lets go
see you julie
stay out of jail
max and henry exit the back stage doors
you were right henry
you got a nose like a bloodhound
you found it
in lophakins dressing room
we find a way to get into his dressing room and were right as rain
henry and max notice frank standing at the corner of the alley having a cigarette
he glares at them as they pass
henry gets ready for his date
max keeps talking sitting on the side of the tub as he draws the bath
i can see it henry
its all in front of me
the pieces of the puzzle are on the table
all we got to do is put them in the right order
the only thing is the dirt
where does the dirt from the tunnel go
what about the vault
first things first
im on the dirt
how do i look
we had a good day kid
its good to be back in the soup
he starts to take off his go have a nice supper
henry places it between a plate and a napkin linking them together like
henry waits for julie
hes all cleaned up
sorry im late
looks at the menu
a guy whos leaving sees her julie
the guy glances at henry
that guys a total dick
she studies the menu
how was rehearsal
she puts it down
i feel like duck
its the end of the meal
i dont just want to be good i want to be great
and i dont just want to be great in buffalo
i guess thats where people go
i dont want my legacy to be a buffalotto commercial
and its not going to be
soon as this thing is done im out of here
before its too late
sounds like a plan
the waitress brings over the check and the fortune cookies
i hate fortune cookies
julie sings along to the radio smoking half a joint from the ashtray
henry watches her
julie knows shes being watched
shes enjoying herself
we going anywhere in particular
hits the joint want some
henry shakes his head no
she turns the radio up
walk along a precipice near some railings
they move closer to the roar
they look out at the flood lit niagara falls
stand there a moment
you know theres a whole bunch of bodies down there churning around
just caught in the current
they all took the risk and look what happened to them
same in death as they were in life
you kill yourself and nothing changes
they both stare down into the roaring water
all those dreams churning around down there
it makes you sick
i got to get out of here
i get it
they start to walk
so what did you do before jail henry
i worked at a toll booth
i had family that used to live on the other side
i took that bridge all the time
we must of met a hundred times
shes probably right
so you were one of the guys in the tollbooth with those weird rubber gloves
whats so funny
you were watching everyone go somewhere and you were going nowhere
funny sad not funny funny
i worked nights
it gave me time to think
about where i wasnt going
see thats funny
what about now
where you going now
im working on it
whatd they send you to jail for henry
for trying to rob the first buffalo bank
i thought i was on my way to a softball game
it was a mistake
sounds like it
he looks at her
decides but now im going to rob it for real
youre going to rob the bank you already went to jail for robbing
theres a tunnel
runs from the bank to the theatre
she looks out the falls
youre fucking hilarious henry
we cant tell what shes thinking
you know what
as the thought occurs ice cream
henry leans against the sink watching julie at the table eating ice cream
theres music on in the b
they watch one another for a moment
she takes a big spoonful
i cant believe im sitting here
neither can i
she gets up
i want to dance and clap my hands
she moves through into the lounge
i think i must be dreaming
she starts moving around the room dancing to the music
god knows i love my country
i love it deeply
she sits down
i couldnt see out the train window i was crying so much
henrys not sure what shes talking about
she gestures to her copy of the cherry orchard on the coffee table
page twenty one
henry opens it
i couldnt see out the train window i was crying so much
but i must drink my coffee
she points to the right place
henry awkwardly i have to go to kharkov on the five oclock train
such a bother i wanted to stay and look at you and talk to you
youre as wonderful as ever
he stops looks at her read the next line
even more beautiful and dressed like a parisian
you could blow me down
say it like you feel it
like its real
say it to me
henry takes a beat
this time he makes it his
even more beautiful and dressed like a parisian
you could blow me down
she laughs like a little girl
and get up
your brother says im an upstart a money grubber
yes you are
youre a bank robber henry
the text again i dont care a bit
i just want you to believe in me like the old days
pulling him around the room dont stop i just want your wonderful tender eyes to look at me like they did then
henrys getting into it
i just want your wonderful tender eyes to look at me like they did then
she laughs some more
im glad i ran you over
henry puts the book down
henry and julie asleep in the bed
she opens her eyes
realizes hes there with her
as if sensing her he opens his eyes too
they look at one another
she climbs on top of him
sun streams in through the window
tchaikovsky plays on a tiny transistor radio
max humming to the music reading future shock on the toilet
the sound of the front door of the apartment opening henry
pulling up his boxers i figured it out
once were in that dressing room the dirt from the tunnel goes out through the roof
rushing out into the front that bank doesnt stand a chance
henry is standing right there holding a bag of groceries julie is right next to him
max goes white
hes in his underwear
good morning max
max is frozen
i didnt know the dirt from the tunnel goes out through the roof
she laughs a little
max looks at henry like what the fuck
we brought breakfast
how do you like your eggs
henry enters the kitchen
leaving max and julie there
im not going to tell anyone
max follows henry into the kitchen
henry unpacks the groceries
you told her
about what were doing
its a crime
youre supposed to keep crimes a secret
its okay max
its not kosher
how do you like your bacon
max leaves the kitchen for the front room where julies waiting amused by the whole thing
max just stands there in his underwear a moment sizing her up
ill get dressed
so what were you in prison for max
max slurps his coffee
im a confidence man
you mean a con man
i never liked that word
its only half of what it is
the word confidence comes from the latin
thats what im about
she considers this
you mean you make people feel good
and then you rip them off
he glances at henry
but i was always much better at the feeling good part than the ripping off part
hence the prison
arent you guys worried about getting caught
for me its a win win situation
i like jail
three hots and a cot
julie looks at henry now
you too henry
you like jail
i like it out here
so why would you take the risk
is it the money
henry doesnt answer starts to collect the plates
it must be the money
you are a criminal
a greedy little criminal
washing the plates your brother leonid says im an upstart a money grubber
but i dont care a bit
he turns to her
i just want you to believe in me like the old days
what is that
we read it last night
you really are good
hes a natural
i thought you were on a date
reading chekhovs a date
she downs her coffee
i got to get to the theatre can you give me a ride there
im a volunteer
she regards him a moment
you werent in any of those plays were you
but can you give me a ride
julie as madame ranevsky
her brother gayev and her daughter varya are also on stage
oh my cherry orchard
after the dark stormy autumn and the winter frosts you are young again and full of happiness the heavenly angels have never abandoned you
oh if only i could be free of the stone that weighs me down
if only i could forget my past
watching from the back of the theatre in the semi darkness
max watches too
he wears his volunteer badge
yes and now the orchard will be sold to pay our debts which seems impossible
its mamma walking in the orchard
in a white dress
laughing with joy there she is
a projection of the mother floats across the screen and dissolves into one of the cherry trees
henry and max speak in hushed voices this is driving me crazy
we could be digging right now
if we were in that dressing room
there are people everywhere
this is pissing me off
after a moment he stops where he is
then turns back to henry
i got an idea
you have to be lophakin
if you did wed be able to get into that tunnel whenever we want
im not an actor
youre not a bank robber either
and youre doing that
she said you were a natural
that means you can do it
no it doesnt
yes it does henry
you are lophakin
a man who came from nothing
a man whos not afraid to create a new life
a man whos in love with her
henry stares at julie mid performance on the stage
your dream is your truth is your destiny
i cant be lophakin
they have a lophakin
what if they didnt
there has to be another way
max frustrated kid you forced me out of jail to help you
and im going to goddamn help you
but you got to help me help you
now i need to know
a fierce stare do you want this bank or not
i want it
then youre gonna be lophakin
walks down the street
he approaches the theatre
arnold enters shivering shaking the snow off his coat
good morning everyone
none of the actors pay him much attention
he pours himself a cup of coffee makes his way toward his dressing room
arnold opens the door with his key
arnold enters hangs up his coat
there is a formal envelope leaning against his make up mirror
starts to read
as he absorbs the words he lets out a small gasp
falls into his chair
after a moment he puts down the letter and stares at himself in the mirror
you knew this day would come
you deserve this lubya
he closes his eyes
bows his head
starts to weep
close on darek the veins on the side of his forehead pulsate with rage
julie stands in the wings
max joins her
arnolds leaving the production
on the stage
simon behind them
darek is right in but i have no choice its willie lohman were talking about
brandishing the letter a ken waterstone production
oooh la la
a ken waterstone production
the heavens have opened
you lucky boy
run run to that pandering populist piece of shit waterstone and his spineless productions
youre perfect for it
good bye darek
arnold marches off the stage with his case
i need a new lopakhin
im dying olga
well hold auditions this afternoon darek
ill get the list darek ingests caffeine and nicotine at an alarming rate ive seen that shit list
its a disaster
what do we do
i must think
he moves stage left past julie
your orchard cannot be felled before she has a chance to grow
and with that he disappears with olga out the door
it is ken waterstone
she shoots him a look picks up her stuff and goes
julie on the phone searches for her keys in the bag as she approaches her car
yes stan yes
i know its bullshit but thats whats happening
i dont know hes thinking
she gets in the car
tries to find a roach in the ashtray
a knock at the passenger window
she looks up
he gestures can i come in
max gets in
sorry i cant give you a ride you said he was a natural
let me call you back
she hangs up to max what
henry would be perfect for it
perfect for what
it takes a moment till her mind gets a hold of the idea
you mean henry should play lophakin
hes not even an actor
hed be playing himself
off her shocked look think about it julie
he is lophakin
a man who came from nothing
a man whos not afraid to create a new life and put his past behind him
a man whos in love with you
she does think about it
why do i feel like the earth is suddenly shifting under my feet
fact is you need a lophakin and lophakin needs a dressing room
can you get him in to see darek
whats going on here max
what are you doing
she regards him
you made this happen didnt you
sometimes a good guy needs a less good guy to help the good guy be good
a beat she slaps him hard across the cheek
they just sit there for a moment
what am i supposed to do now
he just needs a shot
let the chips fall where they may
what if it doesnt work
theyll get someone else
give him a shot
thats all im asking julie
she thinks some more
okay confidence man
julie sits looking at henry who stands in the middle of the living room of dareks apartment
walking around him
an animal tracking its pray
hes chain smoking
youve never had any training
youve never been in a production
you dont even know the play
i read it
i think i know the scene
he glances at julie
then back at henry
your brother leonid andrevich
how can you perform chekhov and not be able to say and rey e vich
now say it
darek nods continue your brother leonid andreyevich says im an upstart a money grubber a what
a money grubber
darek pushes henry closer to julie
she stands your brother leonid andreyevich says im an upstart a money grubber
he can say whatever he likes
i dont care a bit into his ear henry ignores him and with twice the passion i just want you to believe in me like in the old days
show me tell me
darek laughs circling
henry takes her hand now
his voice drops
good god in heaven
my father was one of your fathers serfs and your grandfathers serf before that
but you you did so much for me in the old days that ive forgotten all that
his yearning is suddenly palpable
i love you
like a sister
more than a sister
henry drops to his knees supplicates
you piece of shit
henry just breathes
henry looks up
darek considers him
be more good
henry and julie share a look
he actually did it
henry rides shotgun
they both look at the road ahead
after a while
does this make me an accessory
i think so
things have certainly gotten a lot more interesting since you showed up
you mean since you ran me over
they make love
its more intense than before
they lie there breathless looking at each other
she makes tea
henry sits at the table watching her
so why are you robbing the bank henry
he doesnt answer
its not just about the money is it
so why are you doing it
it takes a moment for him to answer
i used to sit in that toll booth and think about just getting in one of those cars going wherever they went
just joining someone elses life
you were asleep at the wheel
yeah i was
it was easier for me to go to jail than tell my wife the truth
that i was going along with everything
i didnt know i could change it
so now im changing it
robbing the bank is changing it
it already has
she gets the honey out of the cupboard
pours some in her tea
what was your wife like
are you sure youre okay with this
i know its a lot
she turns to him
not for a girl like me henry
darek addresses the full cast
henry by his side
this is mr
he will be taking over the role of lophakin
if you please
he leads a light round of applause
henry acknowledges thanks
top of act three
henry walks briskly away
julie watches him
henry enters his dressing room locking the door behind him
max is already waiting
he turns the music on
they move the giant armoire thats against the wall aside
max spreads a blanket on the floor to catch the falling rubble and holds another against the wall to muffle the sound
henry pulls a sledgehammer out of a bag he pounds the wall again and again
the blanket is pulled aside to reveal max and henry on the other side looking in
max shines his flashlight its dusty
max climbs through the hole disappears down the tunnel
henry follows counting his steps
max and henry stooped over make their way down the dank dark passage
maxs flashlight combs the floor
a glint of light now as something flashes
the beam scours the blackness ahead looking for the end
and there it is
a soot covered wall maybe ten feet ahead
they reach it
henry touches the damp decrepit brick turns to max
theres still twenty feet to go
he turns back to him were going to need another pair of hands
its cold out
max and henry walk inside
a giant screen showing the game
henry and max arrive at the bar
you got to be kidding me
could you possibly suck anymore
henry and max watch as joe grabs his head flops into a chair
max looks concerned
henry and max sit with the guy joe whos drunk
thanks for meeting us
joe is looking worse for wear
hows your pyramid scheme
it wasnt a pyramid scheme
joe hits his schooner longneck
it all fell apart
we were banking on that money henry
and now all ive got is a garage full of dumb korean plastic
whats he talking about
see what happens when a person tries to go legit
its killing me
joe drains his beer
the waitress arrives with a bucket of steaming wings
so hows debbie
shes worried henry
the babys due in a couple months
he grabs a wing
rips off the meat
yeah shes pregnant
henry takes it in
its okay if you want to punch me out
tonight would be a good night
in fact i could use it
this is great news
off joes hopeless look its going to be okay
you know how much diapers cost
you know how much it costs to send a kid to college
you want to send your baby to college
joe keeps going on the wings
hes making a meal of it
of course not
im just saying
the kid needs stuff
stuff thats expensive
stuff it deserves
these things are hot
im on fire
listen joe maybe we can help
we might have a job for you
max shoots a look at henry
joe chugs a glass of water looking at both of them now
henry max and joe stand hunched over at the end of the tunnel
theres maybe twenty feet till the bottom of that vault
thats a lot of dirt henry
max studies joe
so what do you think
i think we should get some guns and go get the money through the front door
people could get hurt
what about fake ones
theyre still guns
listen joseph guns are dangerous and were not doing a simple hold up
tellers and tears and chump change
were doing an old fashioned heist
were going right into the belly of the beast
are you in or are you in
he picks up a shovel and crunches into the wall of dirt
i hope we dont get caught
henry and julie are in bed
he memorizes his lines
the tvs on low
julies buffaloto commercial comes on
julie snaps it off
i hate that commercial
i like it
she looks at him
so whats your plan
for when its done
making light of it am i going to see your picture in the post office or something
i hope not
but have you thought about what happens after
not really no
he thinks carefully before he says it i dont know
maybe i could meet you out west
maybe you could meet me there
when did you think of that
so what about it
what about what
meeting me im not going anywhere henry youre not
i thought that was your plan
do the play plans change henry
she gets out of bed
throws on her robe
i think i ran out of maple syrup
we follow henry as he walks through her apartment and finds julie in the kitchen standing at the sink not moving
is there a reason you didnt leave before
because life is fucked
it never works out the way you want it to
but you could still meet me
on the lam
it was just an idea
why not this isnt going to work out henry
she turns to face him
didnt we both know that
i think you should leave
henry just stands there
henry leaves julies apartment
theres snow on the ground
its freezing out here
he starts to walk
its going to be incredible
im talking florida
max hungrily munches his cheerios at the table
all you can eat sunshine
grapefruits as big as your head
henry sits across from him
why couldnt i have met her after
i asked her to meet me
after were done
whatd she say
she said no
of course she said no
why of course
because life aint like that
theres always a cost
thats why they call it life
you got to pay somewhere
the piper must be paid to pipe
i paid already max
i dont want to leave her
max looks at him
about to say something a knock at the door
henry walks to the door
who is it
henry opens it
joe stands there
and a little sheepish
now we see why eddie vibes is standing right beside him
he walks right on in
the same bank
now thats poetry
i like it
who is this guy
eddie beams at max
your new partner
max looks at henry huh
what do you mean
or youre out
i screwed up
joe lies down on the floor
hes drunk as a skunk
amused by the whole thing joe tells me you guys might need a little help with that vault
i know the whole story
and i dont dig
got any cold ones
joe doesnt know what hes talking about
hes a drunk
he made a mistake
get out of that chair
leans back on it
relax old man
henry and i go way back
weve known each other since high school isnt that right
i know you
appreciate you keeping your mouth shut henry
one thing i admire in a man is the quality of loyalty
what do you want eddie
just the american dream
at the window
looking down as eddie gets into his car
he senses them watching him
gives them the thumbs up
max and henry watch eddie leave
im gonna kill him
with a knife
you cant kill him
slurred on the floor yeah
you cant kill him max
hes got the vault shut up joe
he looks over at joe on the floor
thinks about how easy it would be to just kick him in the head
deb says we cant have sex till the kids born
says the kidll know about it
before its too late
henry in period costume
he has a beard
he watches from the stalls as they run a dress rehearsal
im sorry to be blunt but for gods sake the man has robbed you
stopping her ears no
dont say that
hes a scoundrel everybody knows it but you
hes a petty scoundrel a user
on henry feeling like the accused
from the stage julie sees him
you are twenty six or twenty seven and youre still in the lower grades
she locks eyes with henry now you ought to be grown up by now
at your age you ought to understand about love where are you djula
with double the fire you ought to love someone yourself
you ought to have an affair
carlotta and the girls
lets run the magic scene
julie walks off the stage
she knows henry is waiting for her
what happened last night
i came to my senses
and you should too
she walks on
we should talk about it
i dont want to henry
henry arrives to find max attaching one of the bags of dirt to a pulley
above them joe begins to hoist it up through the open skylight
henry looks up
tugging the pulley three feet of it so far today
well make it
henry goes to the open doors of the armoire
the tunnel is deeper now and all lit up
henry max and joe make their way toward joes car
what do you think guys
if its a boy do i cut him or not
well you know what they say cleanliness is next to godliness
what do you say henry
before he can answer
i see you guys in the bank
i see you guys in the alley next to the bank
frank the bank guard is standing right there
hes in his street clothes
now i see you coming out of the theatre behind the bank
frank sucks his teeth
i know what youre up to gentlemen
henry max and joe look at each other
frank moves closer
checks around to make sure no one can hear them
and i want in
in on what
we cant talk here
max looks at henry
max is in the passenger seat
henry in the back next to frank
whats on your mind frank
indigenous currency retrieval and exchange
they exchange glances
once a month a truck goes to all our partner banks across the border in canada picks up all the currency and brings it back home
id say on average eight to twelve million held in our vault at first buffalo for just a few hours before its picked up for redistribution
now theyre paying attention
only a bunch of fools would rob that bank any other time
he leans closer
i can give you that date
i can help with alarms
i can be your guy on the inside
hypothetically say you were right about what were up to
which youre not
but just say
why would you help us rob your bank
i got my reasons
this sounds like a set up man frank grabs joe
glares into his eyes
i dont fuck around kid
i told you
i got my reasons
well forgive us frank
but were going to need to hear them
the wife got sick a few years ago
insurance wouldnt pick up all the costs
so i went to the bank
they wouldnt help cover the difference
we were going to retire to the loire valley
we had to use all our savings to cover the bills
the man gave it to you huh
i spent everything we had then she died
thirty years ive been at that bank
what was her name
her name was annie
the moment just hangs there
the moneys delivered at eight and picked up at midnight
he turns to henry
i retire in two weeks
this is it
you set up the table
i make sure dinner arrives hot
max and henry walk up to the theatre
theyve got coffees
they both look up
on the marquee chekhovs the cherry orchard
opens november rd pm opening night
were going to have pull some nights
maybe we should wait
do it closing night
this is a one time deal
i told you there were going to be tests henry
henry absorbs that
looks at max
youre going to have to leave her
no looking back
an ambulance peels into the drive
a patient is wheeled inside
walking down a corridor toward a nurses station at the far end
the doors open for him
he hesitates debbie in profile smiling and talking to a seated receptionist who touches her very pregnant belly
henry takes a step back the doors close
he watches through the glass a moment
debbie looks radiant
walks back outside again
its as if he got all the answers he needed
max and joe are digging
looks like theyve been at it for hours covered in dirt and sweat
henry enters the tunnel
there he is
henry picks up his shovel
starts to dig
he goes at it hard
max catches his mood
you okay henry
he turns to max
im not leaving her
the girl he throws down his shovel
now listen henry
youre digging this tunnel
and youre gonna rob that bank
youre gonna take the money and youre gonna put it in the car and were gonna drive away
this is one thing
julie is another thing
this is not that
that is not this
i think i got something
joe furiously digs his shovel into the caked in dirt above his head
suddenly the ceiling of dirt comes free burying joe who struggles to get out
above from where the dirt once was is the smooth surface of concrete
the bottom of the vault
we have arrived
look at that
joe gets to his feet he looks dazed
henry and max are finished packing up the apartment
henry looks out the window
a beautiful clear blue sky
not a cloud in the sky
so clear you can see tomorrow
youre a good man henry
you too max
a line at the box office
theatergoers mill around waiting for friends or chatting everyone anticipating a great evening of theatre
the cast dressed for stage is gathered in the green room chatting nervously to one another
standing on opposite sides of the room
hush descends as darek walks in
in this american dream of ours everyone is happy and smiling they have achieved their objectives
and yet in life there is only change upheaval the birth of the new
and that birth is painful
avoiding henrys gaze
our play is about misery disconnection a future that we dont see hitting us like a train
but tonight my players we show them
that this not a future to fear
the players applaud off the cushion in the corner double into the centre pocket
ten minutes people
julie sits by her vanity finishing her make up
a knock on the door

he approaches her
i want us to be together
thats so ridiculous to her
we screwed a couple of times henry

i dont want to be with you
that cuts him dead
youre a thief
go rob your bank
max helps seat some elderly people
enjoy the show folks
he checks his watch
its two minutes to eight
he walks briskly up the aisle
frank watches through the glass doors out onto the empty street
he looks at his watch sucks his teeth
on a headset
points to henry
on henry watching the curtain start to rise
a long white post modern room
sounds of wind
its may but frosty
through the windows
cherry trees in full bloom which contrast with the stark modernity of the nursery set
theyre big screen projections on real tree trunks lophakin enters with dunyasha holding a candelabra
well thank god the train is in
what time is it
checks his watch almost two
blowing out the candle its light already
henry yawns and stretches
the trains late
at least two hours
rounds a corner into view
pulls up right in front of the first buffalo bank
bernie and stan jump out
bernie knocks on the glass door
how you doin frank
he un holsters his weapon covers as stan opens the back of the truck
through the glass frank smiles
doin good bernie
he sucks his teeth
max bursts out the back door of the theatre his walk turning into a run
julie as madame ranevksy enters the nursery in rapt delight
my nursery my dear beautiful sweet nursery
this is where i used to sleep when i was a little girl
henry as lophakin turns to face her waiting for her to say hello
instead she breezes past him
im still like a little girl
she kisses gayev and varya and then gayev again
she kisses everyone in fact except lophakin
your train was two hours late
how do you explain that
is that good management
bernie breaks the seal of an envelope hands it to stan
frank unlocks the plastic casing to the vault keypad for stan who punches in the codes on the slip of paper that was inside the envelope
frank reaches into his pocket
we glimpse his phone
he presses send
max struggles to the top of a telephone pole by an open electrical box
his cell phone vibrates
he pulls it out reads it
he unzips a fanny pack pulls out a wire cutter but his hands are trembling and he drops it
thirty feet to the ground
standing next to simon henry watches julie perform from the side of the stage
oh my childhood my innocent childhood
i used to sleep in this nursery
i looked out from here into the garden
i woke up happy every morning
isnt she beautiful
she looks out toward the window through which there is now a projection of the orchard this time in autumnal decay
oh my cherry orchard
as he and bernie watch stan load the money into the vault
you ever think what you could do with all that money frank
i know what youd do
buy the bills and put them in first place
youd need a lot more money than that
but i guarantee you id have them back in the super bowl within two seasons
another chance to lose
frank laughs nervously
max picks up the wire cutters off the ground checks his watch
his heart jumps
he starts up the pole again
finally reaches the top
struggles to find the right wire
oh god oh god
where are you you little pischer
he finally finds the right one and cuts it
bernie and stan place the last of the money in the vault
bernie closes the vault
stan returns to the keypad
begins pecking in the re arming code as max quickly attaches the circuit bypass wire
stan completes the code
just as hes about to hit the enter button max clips the bypass onto the other side of the wire and the numbers start to come up
stan hits enter the vault clanks again
a red light indicates the alarm is on
max looks at the screen
all the numbers match
the red light turns green
he sighs relieved
i saw this excellent piece of theatre yesterday
really very funny
im sure it wasnt in the least funny
i believe people like you should examine their own lives instead of going to the theatre to observe other peoples
to be honest
we live a stupid life
frank stan and bernie are by the truck
well this is it frank
we got you something
a little retirement gift
bernie produces a neatly wrapped gift
its a bag of coffee
we wanted to get you something from france
you like french roast right
you know this isnt from france
what are you talking about
its french roast
but over there they call it coffee
slightly baffled at bernie but this is french roast
joe and eddie in the tunnel waiting
eddie looks at his watch
where is he
wheres that old man
max pulls open the door sweating runs inside
straight into julie
julie break a leg
plays already started max
she walks past him
good bye confidence man
good bye julie
max hurries down the stairs rushes into henrys dressing room
max opens the armoire looks inside to a waiting joe and go

joe leans over and pukes on the ground

eddie looks at him

eddie grabs the drill
starts to make a hole
joe starts to prepare the charges
lophakin and madame ranevsky perform
well what should we do

at once right this second the auction is coming up very soon a muffled boom o
julie looks at him
its all so vulgar
another muffled boom o
this time the audience looks around
julie glares at him
henry rushes in to the tunnel to find joe and max staring at the underside of the steel bank vault
its like a gleaming jewel
that was good kid
a little giddy there she is
henry reaches up touches the steel vault bottom rubs it
get out of there
eddie arrives in his protection suit holding a thermite burning tool
this shit comes straight from hell
they scramble out
he puts his protective helmet on
its like an inferno eddies manic face behind the mask a man possessed screaming a river of molten steel dripping down right in front of him
the bottom of the vault drops onto the ground
smoke clears to reveal eddie
he pulls off his hood
welcome to my world bitches
they all look up at the hole
as his head rises into view through the newly cut hole
he climbs in and touches the saran wrapped stack of cash subdivided into bricks
he sits on it
its dead quiet in here
max pops his head up
stares at the cash youre on henry
is the cherry orchard sold
audiences pov as madame ranevsky faces lophakin on the other side of the stage
its like a showdown
who bought it
madame ranevsky is overwhelmed by the news
varya takes her keys and throws them on the floor
exits in a rage
i bought it

im all dizzy
i cant talk

lophakin swirls on stage
and now the cherry orchard is mine
god in heaven

finish lining up the duffels of cash by the door

max freezes suddenly notices eddie is standing there with a gun pointed at him and joe
whats that eddie
its a gun max
max doesnt seem so surprised
with the gun joe
take the money out back to my car
joe doesnt move
eddie waves the gun
max boldly steps right in front of the gun

eddie puts the gun to maxs stomach
dont be stupid max
youre not going to do this eddie
you can shoot me dead if you want but youre going to have to shoot me dead
eddie punches max in the gut then pops him in the head as he throws him back
im not playing with you old man

the door swings open henry walks in on the scene
welcome to the party brando
seeing the gun henry freezes at the door
eddies in the middle max and joe by the mouth of the tunnel max on the floor a gash on his forehead from eddies blow
what are you doing eddie
eddie turns at him

eddie kicks him again

he turns back to henry

he gestures to the tunnel
joe suddenly turns back grabs eddies gun hand from behind
the gun goes off
joe bites eddies hand
max straddling eddie grabs his head bangs it on the famach deh mohl
gey lig mittn vahntzin son of a bitch
henry a little dazed picks up the gun

they roll eddie over start to hog tie his hands then his legs
eddie starts to freak out
you couldnt have done this without me
our new partner
max stuffs a glove into eddies mouth but eddie still kicks like crazy
max notices henrys thigh
henry sees it now too
its a graze
i got shot
henry hears the tannoy
its his cue
i gotta get on stage
he rushes out
on stage the lights come up revealing a line of hooded faceless figures standing behind the scrim axes by their side
they walk out onto the stage
thank you my friends thank you
lophakin rushes on stage
yasha holding a tray with small tumblers of champagne shoots him a look
madame ranevsky enters from the other side hands out cash to the line of hooded figures
the peasants have come to say good bye
theyre good fellows yermolai aleksayovich but in my opinion a little stupid
to madame ranevsky you gave them everything in your purse lyuba
wrong quite wrong
i couldnt help it
i couldnt help it
gayev and madame ranevsky walk past lophakin ignoring him on their way out
still a little out of wont you please come here and drink a glass as a good bye
eddie gagged and bound lies in the middle of the tunnel as max closes the door to the dressing room
old man huh
eddie tries to scream but he cant
as max shuts the door all light is blotted out
positioned now by the cherry trees behind the scrim and back lit
were going and not a soul will be here until after were gone
she notices hes clutching his thigh
max and joe load the last of the duffels filled with cash into the back of joes car
they get inside
joe starts the engine
where is he
any minute now
goodbye to the old life
hello to the new life
trofimov exits with anya
varya looks around the room and exits
yasha and carlotta exit with the dog
lophakin to madame ranevsky and gayev until the spring then
goodbye my friends until we meet again
as he and julie exchange a final look
she watches him go
its as if hes moving in slow motion
oh my dear sweet lovely orchard
my life my youth my happiness farewell
henry comes out the back door
gets in the car
hows the leg
joe guns it
sitting in the back
the peasants hooded figures raise their axes
they suddenly have the manner of executioners
they stand ready to fell madame ranevskys beloved orchard
as madame ranevsky one last look at these walls these windows
dear mother used to love to walk about in this room
as madame ranevsky were coming
the sound of the hooded figures as they chop the trees behind her
madame ranevsky holds her hands over her ears and falls to the ground
and begins to weep
stop the car
joe stop the car
he cant stop the car its the getaway
yeah you cant joe screeches to a halt
henry gets out of the car
what the hell are you doing
henry starts to run back toward the theatre as best he can
max sticks his head out the window
but hes already gone
the hooded figures finish destroying the orchard
trees litter the stage
madame ranevsky still holds her hands over her ears on the ground
as the cacophony ends she gets up slowly and turns to walk off the stage
coming down the aisle is henry as lophakin pause
he comes closer
hes limping slightly
i had to come back
i couldnt get on the train
the moment i stepped on the platform the blood drained from my heart
on julie in shock
i knew i might never see you again
he steps up on the stage
what is he doing
why is lophakin back
i had to come back
henry what is this
what are you doing
this is the only way youll listen to me
she looks out to the audience
eager faces awaiting madame ranevskys response
you should have gotten on that stupid train
you made a mistake
the mistake would have been getting on that train without telling you how i feel
dont pretend you care about me
all you care about is money
she tries to get past him
he blocks her
you think this is about money
he grabs her
its never been about money
you know that
let go of me
just leave henry
under her breath get off the fucking stage take a chance
meet me in moscow
no im perfectly happy here
thats not true
meet me in moscow
she tries to get away again
let me go
why are you doing this
youre just afraid
im not afraid of anything she kicks out at him
what am i afraid of henry
youre afraid because i love you
that hits her
she breaks away from him stepping back
on the side of the stage
she searches his expression now
meet me in moscow
she cant move
the audience is rapt
tell me youll meet me in moscow
there are tears in her eyes now
go with him
meet him in moscow
at the back of the theatre
stunned he loves her
she whispers softly
looks down at his leg
darek is alive once more
whisper to simon lights down ten
down ten more
julie and henry in silhouette now
oh fuck henry
the lights fade as an image of white cherry blossoms appears on the projection screen
which become real blossoms on a cherry tree widening to reveal an orchard the most beautiful youve ever seen
frank sits at a table outside in the garden
he pours himself a pernod
he looks happy as a clam
a cat jumps in his lap purring
hello miou miou
he looks out at the lush valley below
a state of the art hospital room
no expense has been spared
a shaky image of debs face as joe frames the video camera
the baby comes into view now
and screaming its little lungs out
its a girl
a nurse hands the baby to debbie
joe looks on tears stream down his face
we follow a mailman past a row of palm trees as he enters a traditional looking barber shop maxs a place for the mailman hands a few letters to the
pretty front desk girl
max his back to us finishes a shave talking his customers ear off
time is a medium of exchange
you can buy things with it
you can even figure out your dream
the guy nods
we see him now
hes super tan
he pulls the sheet off his client
another young customer sits down
theres a few of them waiting their turn enjoying maxs schtick
the front desk girl hands max the mail
close on a postcard our dream is our truth is our destiny
xx max smiles
flips over the postcard and only now when he pins it above the mirror do we finally see what it is an image of the hollywood sign
so tell me javier
whats your dream
fade up on what looks like the african bush
there are insects buzzing around and it doesnt look like rains landed anywhere near here in years
a hand reaches out for another hand helping someone over the final step
sitting right below the hollywood sign now
looking down on the whole basin of los angeles
she hands him a bottle of water
you can see the ocean
he puts his arm around her
your brother says im an upstart a money grubber
but i dont care a bit
they kiss in the sun for a while
eddie vibes is being questioned by the unseen detective
im only going to ask you one more time eddie
who was it
who helped you
i told you before
happy and doc whaack
the slap knocks eddie to the ground
hes under the table now his face crushed by the detectives boot you know what you are vibes
a liar a cheat a thief and a loser
he presses his boot down harder on eddies face i may be all those things but one thing im not
is a rat
his face squashed sideways like that its a pretty strange kind of smile
