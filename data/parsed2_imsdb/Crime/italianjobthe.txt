screenplay by donna powers and wayne powers based on the screenplay by troy kennedy martin december forklifts rumble
workers wipe frame
all the bustle and cacophony of a major seaport
we find ourselves focusing on one large crate
with the grinding of gears a crane lifts it off the dock and carries it onto a ship
through night vision binoculars charlie croker watches the mysterious crate
charlie is young to run his own crew but hes a born leader
swish pan to lyle brilliant and punctilious fingering the keyboard of his strap on supercharged laptop
ive got the orbital data and sv clock corrections for each satellite that gets the signal
thatll make my reading as solid as the precise positioning service that only the d
were talkin meter horizontal accuracy meter vertical accuracy
nanoseconds time accuracy
swish pan to steve bearded
steve has an arrogant confidence mixed with the hint of a smile
why cant he talk like a person
because hes not
i do need one more thing charlie
someone to turn the goddamn homing device on
no signal no score
to steve wherere the italians
the driver is handsome rob
riding shotgun is half ear immersed in a book albert einstein creator rebel
half ear is a large black man with a southern accent and a hearing aid
whats that shit
its called reading
you should try it some time
handsome rob holds up three fingers
you wanna read something
read between the lines
well heres something even you can relate to
albert got a lotta trim
that genius thing is a babe magnet
lemme see that book
the final member of the crew john bridger s is a tasteful man buying a very tasteful and very expensive diamond necklace
the saleswoman wraps it up as he dials a number on his cell phone
stella bridger crushingly attractive has just stepped out of the shower hair still wet body wrapped in a towel
how are you
im sending you something
does it smell nice
but its sparkly
does it come with a receipt
im having it sent to you from the store
toweling her hair why not bring it by yourself
we could have dinner
he leaves the store and heads for the hotel elevator
be a long trip
im in genoa
she doesnt like the sound of that
let me guess
checking out the birthplace of christopher columbus
something like that
with your parole officers approval
he steps into the elevator
i think ive paid my p
my last visit
i liked the guy but we never really connected
what are you into dad
dont break my heart
you told me you were through
after this i swear to you i am
you promised me
daddy dont do this
the elevator door opens bridger steps out and starts down the hall
everythings going to be fine
ive got to go now
i love you
he clicks off then uses his card key to step into the he eyes charlie who looks pretty tense
dont worry theyll come through
you can trust these guys
i trust everyone
its the devil inside them that i dont trust
then to charlie got a sec
they step inside charlie closing the door
how you feeling boss
im fine fine
bridger seems amused by that answer
you know what fine stands for dont you
fucked up insecure neurotic and emotional
youve become quite the philosopher since you quit drinking
you dont like me sober
no im glad
makes you a better thief
bridger pulls out a fine cigar still in its wrapper hands it to charlie
for after the haul
hope i get to fire it up
if steves italians are a no show its three months prep down the shitter and ive dragged you out of retirement for nothing
this is kinda nice
you being the boss with all the worries me just along for the ride
aint you sweet
from the other side of the door they hear charlie
charlie takes the binoculars from steve
he sees two italian customs inspectors climbing onboard the ship
i toss em away if theres a problem down the road
in italian the inspectors quiz the nervous captain about the mysterious crate
one inspector takes a crowbar and yanks out several strips of plywood revealing unmarked cardboard boxes inside
the other inspector pulls out one of the boxes and tears it open
it is filled with tomatoes
he takes a bite out of one
everything seems to be order
the captain looks relieved
the inspector closes the cardboard box but
watch carefully now because as he does this he hits a power button on a small homing device and stuffs it in with the tomatoes
on lyles computer screen a pulsating dot appears beeping sending out precise longitude and latitude
for those about to rock we salute you
charlie dials his cell phone
handsome rob answers
lets get rich
handsome rob pulls over
theyre at the port
they can see the mysterious crate being lowered into the ships hold
half ear climbs out taking a large duffel bag with him
the captain is doing his final checks before launch
our camera drops to where we find half ear in scuba gear applying nitramon explosive primer to the hull of the ship
plowing through thick brush that breaks out onto a secluded beach
handsome rob is still behind the wheel but now steve is in the passenger seat
lyle in the back is still on the laptop legs fidgeting like a drummer on meth
pop goes his bubble gum
can you chill out back there
youd make a hummingbird nervous
half ear finishes up
speaks into the headset inside his gear
enjoy the ride cowboy
half ear grabs onto the bottom rung of a ladder that is bolted to the side of the ship as it launches off the dock and into deeper water
its charlie and john bridger in scuba gear riding torpedo shaped dive propulsion vehicles dpvs that pull them through the deep blue sea at a good m
both dpvs drag equipment bags
a global satellite positioning device is mounted on the handlebar of charlies dpv being fed information via lyles laptop
a circle pulsates on the monitor a beacon to the crate in the ship
half ear still clings to the ladder
its a wild ride
through the headset inside his gear he hears get ready
half ear lets go of the ladder
the ships propellers speed by just above his head
he removes a radio controlled detonator
hits the button
the hull of the boat explodes
a very neat hole on the bottom of the boat beneath the crate is opened
water rushes in and the crate falls right through the cavity vanishing
the huge heavy crate drops down
hits the bottom
shes taking on water fast
no way to save her
the captain orders the dinghy lowered into the water
parked in the sand at the top of the bay
steve looks out to the bay through infrared binoculars
the ship is going down
the crew on the dingy head back to the port which is in the opposite direction of this beach
the dpvs are now attached by a tether to an underwater lifting bag that is used to move heavy loads through water
the crate is surrounded by our three diver bandits
using crowbars they pull apart the plywood
the cardboard boxes of tomatoes dump out tomatoes spilling everywhere
and now we see what was hidden between the boxes
a large safe
they move like clock work
half ear aims an underwater light at the dial
charlie drills a small hole near the dial
john peers inside a horoscope and lines up the three wheels of the combination lock
until the door pops open
as they stare at whats inside they speak into their headsets heard by all
that for which all virtue is sold
and almost every vice gold
and now we see the contents of the safe glistening gold bricks
made in singapore they weigh pounds and each one is decorated with the face of an exotic balinese girl
were talking thirty million dollars worth of gold
they holler and high five and its just a great moment to be alive
steve takes another peek through his infrared binoculars and sees the last vestiges of the ship hang above the waterline then disappear
the gold is now stacked and secured on the lifting bag
they attach an underwater parachute to the bag and hook a hose from an air tank into press of a pressure release valves which cause the parachute to inflate
looking like a hot air balloon underwater the whole thing floats up about fifteen feet
half ear holds onto its side going along for the ride
then charlie and john bridger speed off on the dpvs which are tethered to the inflatable bag
as they glide through the water towards the secluded beach we
the humvee climbs into the mountain ranges of the alps
the gold is in three crates in the cargo bay
handsome rob and steve are still up front
the others are in the back seats the divers out of their scuba gear
they are pouring champagne into paper cups except for bridger who abstains
he holds up his empty cup
my name is john and im a very rich alcoholic
and im going to live my life one very rich day at a time
they laugh and pound their fists against the roof of the humvee
charlie pulls out the cigar bridger gave him
as bridger lights it for him you planned this one down to a t kid
its a gift
you saw the big picture made contingencies covered the angles
hearing this steve looks a little jealous
shit you made thirty million dollars in gold drop out of sight without holding a gun
who else couldve pulled that off
i had big shoes to fill
fill the shoes but dont follow the footprints
whatre you talking about
youve lived the life
my lifes been nothing but fake ids fake business cards and divorce papers
this is the only thing thats real
bridger shows him a photograph of stella that he keeps in his wallet
stellas a beautiful girl
and i spent half her childhood in prison
this is a once in a lifetime haul charlie
bring down the curtain after this one
make a new life
find someone amazing and be there for her
as the advice escapes bridgers mouth a jeep thunders out of a hiding place in the trees and blocks the road
the humvee brakes to avoid running into it
thats the sound of a gun cocking as its pressed against handsome robs temple
anyone acts stupid and his brains go on the windshield
they see the two italian inspectors jump out of the jeep ak s leveled at the crew
steve has double crossed them
on the crew shocked would be a good place to start
what the hell do you think youre doing
but i want the box of cracker jack all to myself
the italians pull the crates of gold out of the back of the humvee
youre not thinking this through
its a stupid move
well youre the brilliant one
the master planner
isnt that so john
steve climbs out of the humvee gun still on handsome rob the ak s aimed at the others
you bet on the wrong horse
well hunt you down
youre gonna regret this
safely outside steve turns his gun on bridger
no regrets dixie cup
he shoots bridger in the head
just like that
the italians follow suit ak s screaming out bursts of full automatic fire at the crew
they duck for cover as the vehicle is riddled with gunfire
theyre in the epicenter of hell
handsome rob jerks the steering wheel and stomps the gas
the humvee hits the side of the jeep grinds alongside it metal tearing against metal
the humvees right side tires precariously hover by the cliff and the raging water below
the gunners keep firing
bullets rip into the humvees tires
it almost escapes but it cant make it on shredded rubber
it careens off the road and the humvee plummets through the air and plunges into the raging river
water cascades in through the open windows
theyre thrown around as the humvee rides the rapids
the passenger door caves in as the humvee rams into a large rock then is swept further downstream
through the foam and spray charlie looks over to bridger
the torrent roars
only their chests and heads are above water
and thats not all
theres a waterfall ahead
the humvee is palmed in its deadly embrace and hurled over
it cartwheels into the pool below sending up a huge geyser of water
it sinks out of sight
the crates of gold are now inside the italians jeep
steve climbs in leaving the crew for dead
the humvee strikes the surface bottom with an ominous thud
the jeep jerks to a stop
a door opens and the bodies of the two italians shot dead are dumped out into the mud
steve is alone now
just him and the millions in gold
the water entombs them
blood from bridgers fatal gunshot mists the water red
they manage to get the door open
they start to swim out but charlie wont go without bridger
he grabs his friends body and pulls it up with him
they drag themselves ashore handsome rob helping charlie pull bridgers corpse
charlie is shocked tormented grieved and angry beyond description
against the rocky embankment he holds bridger
not wanting to ever let go
if you would have told me that i would spend the next three years searching for steve bandell i would have said that was nothing
cause i would have spent a lifetime looking for that bastard if i had to
a top of the line safe
the only light in the office is the beam of a penlight on the dial
gloved hands spin the dial feeling for contact points areas on the dial where a slight resistance can be felt if you have the touch
a woman holds the penlight in her teeth while trying to crack the safe
its stella bridger now
three years later philadelphia she manipulates the dial
she grabs the safes lever and swings the heavy steel door open her face a mixture of pride and relief
but before we see whats inside lights two cops lurk at the doorway
you always work in the dark
buzz of the fluorescents throws me off
shes all yours
the cops come closer and only now do we realize that theyre on the same team
chris perley couldnt crack it
neither could michael hoyt
now you know who to call first
youre expensive stella
those guys cut us a break on subpoena jobs
goodwill community service
well i do it for the money
ill send you the bill
dont you want to see whats inside
i never look
and as she walks off they do look at her
a car rises into frame on a bustling street a mini cooper s
a worldwide motoring icon
its shape crouches low to the ground and its tiny inch wheel at each corner gives it the legendary mini look
if when you see its headlights and classic grille it doesnt bring a smile to your face then youve got no automobile soul
stella takes on the road like someone who loves to be behind the wheel of a car that claimed victory in the monte carlo rally three times
she passes a minivan a breeze with the minis quick go kart like handling
she searches for a parking space on a street lined with suvs
sees a spot its not really a space just a gap between two gas guzzlers theres no way any car could squeeze in
she parallel parks the mini with ease
shes right in front of antique keys and locks dominate the storefront window with the name of the shop stenciled across the glass bridger lock and safe company
stella hops out of the mini
with a poised walk she heads inside
it is filled with old cast iron safes she has rebuilt along with some new models
stellas receptionist greets her
four minutes forty three seconds
youre the man
so whats on the line up
home safe in fairmount park
owner died and the wife never knew the combination
and todd milliken called
he has a prototype combination lock he wants you to test out tomorrow morning
says he added two false contact points on the tumbler
tell him if i dont have it opened in six minutes flat breakfast is on me
and theres a charlie croker in your office
he said you two know each other
an aside and he looks pretty fine for a white boy
without a response stella heads over to and sees him fiddling with her collection of safe doors that line the shelves
he turns around
she steps inside
refresh my memory
after you came to see me and told me what happened to my father i told you i never wanted to see you again didnt i
so im a little confused
i found him
at first it seems that charlies words have no effect on her but then he notices that her hands are trembling
i can tell you where he is
i dont want to know
are you sure
she doesnt answer
hes in los angeles
she doesnt respond
doesnt ask him to go on doesnt ask him not to
so he goes on
the gold bricks he stole from us were minted in singapore and decorated with the face of a balinese girl
ive had my tentacles out and got a call from a friend of mine and your fathers philly steak
stella remembers him
when i was little he would play poker at the house and drop quarters under the table for me to find
he got word from an l
connection named skinny pete that a gold dealer has been buying bricks with the balinese girl on them three or four at a time
you ever heard the expression cut to the chase
i tracked steve down to an address in the hollywood hills
hes changed his last name to frezelli
and get this he had a worthington installed in the house before he even moved in
we both know that you dont install a worthington unless you have something precious to guard
precious or not i dont deal with ill gotten goods
we boosted that gold from a terrorist group that was about to trade it for bio weapons
now that doesnt exactly make us robin hood but maybe in our own little way we were doing a good deed
problem is no one in my crew can handle that safe
and i need someone i can trust
and you think thats me
havent you heard that i work for the other side
what i heard is that you have your fathers touch
and he was the only safecracker i knew who could open a worthington
im not a safecracker
im a professional safe and vault technician
youre john bridgers daughter
and this is our chance to set things right
that sets her off
who do you think you are coming in here
stealing the gold isnt going to bring my father back to life
no it wont
then get out
charlie comes out of her shop and starts down the sidewalk
suddenly handsome rob appears out of the crowd and is walking next to him
howd it go with the chick
im working on it
i dont want her on the crew charlie
gotta have her
important piece of the puzzle
there has to be someone else
what about bill huchins
doing ten long at levinworth
handsome rob stops charlie
i dont want a civilian to screw this up
she has the skill
and the motivation
you know what happens when emotion gets into it
its emotional for all of us at this point
dont kid yourself
richard worth has his back to the bar
hes a blue blood trial lawyer with an ego that has more horsepower than a ferrari
its all in my patented sideways glance
he gives a sideways glance to stella its their first date
i hit each woman on the jury with one of these
we make contact
and i know exactly what theyre doing
undressing me with their eyes
what a nightmare
someone bumps into stella a mumbled excuse me
the case is all but won
thats why in jury selection i choose as many women as possible
except lesbians of course
i can tell in sixty seconds if theyre a lesbian
want to know how i know
if they dont undress you with their eyes
like that waitress right there
shes looking at me right below my belt
definitely not a lesbian
a waitress is indeed looking below richards belt
but stella notices that she was only looking because richards zipper is all the way down
i am fly
and im da bomb
just wait until later tonight
suddenly a busboy stumbles and a tray of drinks fall soaking richards suit in red wine
you should be
what the hells wrong with you
it was an accident
im very sorry
wheres the manager
richard worth is not paying to have his suit cleaned
to stella im going to
i dont believe this
he starts off to the bathroom and as soon as the space he was occupying empties charlie fills it
i think your dates going pretty well what do you think
she shoots him a look that could reverse global warming
what are you doing here
what do you mean
i come here all the time
i dont think so
lawyers judges my kind of crowd
see that gentleman there he sentenced me to days in county once
we need to talk
no you need to listen
i want you to leave
hey i paid valet parking prices to get in here not to mention a twenty spot to the busboy to spill that drink on mister zipper
you i dont believe this
you paid someone to spill that drink
actually you paid for it
charlie returns her wallet
didnt notice it was me who bumped into you earlier did you
anyway i was hoping we could get to know each other a little better before we leave for los angeles
i already booked your flight
you truly are a fatuous odious man
i have no idea what you just said but i like the sound of it
well maybe youll understand this
hit the road jack charlie or youll be sorry charlie cause ill kick you in the nuts so hard that your voice will be as high as my heels
she means it too
im beginning to worry about this whole relationship
ill let you in on a secret
you cant have a relationship with a pickpocket gold robber or any kind of thief
charlie looks away lets her have her point
this whole thing is getting pretty heated so when he turns back to her he uses a whole new approach
his emotions are genuine
john wasnt just a man i crewed up with he was my friend he was the closest thing to a father i ever had
i wish to god i could bring him back
but all i can do is go after this guy the guy that killed him and hit him where he lives
she feels the honesty in his words but before she can reply theyre interrupted by everything alright stella
hes back red wine splotched on his suit
charlie was just saying goodbye
but for now charlie is just staring at richard boring into to him
can i help you with something
i was just undressing you with my eyes
and with that charlie goes
stella cant help but smile
she comes home having shed her date
she goes through a drawer and pulls out a package she hasnt looked at for years
she opens it
inside is the beautiful necklace that her father bought her in italy
it brings tears to her eyes
he lies in bed cant sleep
his phone rings
he picks up
shes on the other end of the line
im in this for one thing charlie and one thing only
i want to see the look on his face when his gold is gone
he took my father from me im taking this its the best i can do
stellas mini passes weaves tucks in between cars
she drives like a madman
charlie feels like hes inside a video game
i see drive defensively is your motto
jack daniels never let me down
she slaps the dashboard of her car
by the way you drive im not surprised you named your car after a bottle of whiskey
jack daniels was chief engineer of the mini
and i drive it exactly the way it was meant to be driven
she whips down the avenue
she hangs a left
were going in circles
whos tailing you this week
the possibilities are endless
the mini parks in the middle of the huge empty lot that surrounds veterans field home of the philadelphia phillies
she looks around
where are they
were a little early
i didnt expect us to get here quite that fast
a vespa pulls into the lot headed their way
charlie starts the introductions
hes who really invented napster
below a metallica poster lyle has fallen asleep on his desk
his roommate napster creator shawn fanning recognizable in his trademark baseball cap sneaks a peek at lyles computer
at least thats how lyle tells it
and now they see a monster pick up truck bouncing into the lot music thumping from its alpine at ear bleeding levels
he lost fifty percent of his hearing in the fifth grade
a year old boy stands in front of a toilet in the stall
water geysers out of the bowl and soaks him
one m in the toilet bowl too many
some kids in the bathroom saw the whole thing
that was rad
and now a rumbling in the distance
sees a car streaking their way almost like a mirage in the heat waves coming off the pavement
a classic mustang
its engine rumbles like a jackhammer
its had some serious custom work done to it
premier wheel man
he once drove all the way to l
just so he could set the record for longest freeway chase
handsome robs behind the wheel flicks a cigarette butt out his open window we watch it hit the pavement ashes spark and then behind the fallen butt we see that
every lane of the is filled with cop cars in pursuit
smashed the mark by twelve minutes
we now see handsome rob through the lens of a tv news helicopter camera
he got a hundred and ten love letters sent to his jail cell from women who saw him on tv
as the cars converge in the parking lot
and what about you
ive been a thief since i had baby teeth
seven year old charlie is shoved against a chain link fence by a sixth grade bully
cough it up charlie
charlie hands the bully a dollar bill
the bully puts it in a wallet that is over stuffed with cash and saunters off laughing it up with his bully pals
charlie turns to his nd grade classmate who sports a fresh black eye
so much for lunch
you need a dollar
i thought he took your last one
charlie holds up the over stuffed wallet that he pickpocketed from the bully
but i got lots more now
doors open simultaneously
the crew eyes stella
charlie gets right down to business
this is stella
shes working with us on this one
handsome rob hands out fake drivers licenses
reading his melvin lisp
could i just once have a cool name
also complaining pounds
try deal a meal
i dont even have a cool nickname
enough of this sewing circle shit
half ear hands out new cell phone to everyone and takes their old phones
philly steak says these are clean as a whistle
he also got us four dozen internal chips with different numbers
change out the chips twice a day
as charlie hands out airline tickets we travel to l
you still havent told us the most important thing
what exactly is the job charlie
and who exactly is she
lyle and half ear have been kept in the dark until now
this is stella bridger
and were finishing the job that we started in italy
theyre a little stunned at first
its about time
the crew deplane from five different airplanes different air carriers
they disperse in separate vehicles
see charlie at avis renting a car
see handsome rob renting a u haul panel truck
see stella on a hotel shuttle bus
see half ear on the underground metro rail taking the red line
see lyle in a taxi headed south on figueroa street
he notices a young woman hitchhiking
for a moment their eyes connect
she is a beautiful waif and the feeling sweeps through lyle if only
but the taxi passes by
charlie checks into shutters with its victorian beach house feel and oceanfront view
stellas at the peninsula in beverly hills with its opulent lobby
handsome robs at the standard with its kitschy decor and ironic style
he stares at a huge empty aquarium behind the front desk where a performance artist writhes and a dj spins out rhythmic throbs
half ears at the new renaissance hollywood hotel adjacent to the dramatic babylon gate and the kodak theatre
and lyles at the downtown bonaventure riding up the glass elevator
perfect gearhead hotel
the five of them sit in chairs on the balcony of his hotel room
theres a sweeping view of the pacific
we need an in to get a video blueprint of the interior
were not going into this place blind
half ear you take the first surveillance shift
who goes in who goes out levels of security you know the drill
you got it
i also want audio surveillance on his phone
ill hack into the phone companys central office remote observance monitoring system and fool it into thinking theres a legal tap on the line
reroute the digital copies of his calls to our own listening post
ill burn through the night have it up and running before morning
to handsome rob we need to know how long to get from the house to union station downtown
how much time will you need with the safe
ill have it open in five minutes flat
its not the same as opening a safe for the cops
your heart will be pounding in your ears
perspiration on your fingertips
its a whole different ball game
you get me to the safe ill open it
out over the ocean the sun is in its death throes bruising the sky a coiling purple and orange
nestled at the end of a cul de sac on oporto drive in the hollywood hills
the u haul panel truck is parked on the side of the road that overlooks oporto drive and steves house
its been converted into their surveillance vehicle the back outfitted with monitors and surveillance equipment
half ear peers through binoculars and says his notes into a micro cassette recorder
his binoculars focus in on the fence that surrounds the perimeter of the property
into recorder weve got an anti scaling fence
hardened electroplated steel
hacksaw wont work
well need nitramon
the binoculars swish pan to a guard booth where a guard keeps an eye on the gate
mm semi automatic in the holster
security booth is accessible and ideal for a triple charger chemical grenade
the binoculars swish pan to four rottweilers prowling the grounds
why do black men hate dogs
ill tell you why charlie
because dogs are racist
thats a natural fact
someone else deal with em
a sea of cars gridlock in l
crammed in the middle of the traffic meltdown is handsome robs rental car
timing out the getaway route
hes got a thomas guide on the passenger seat and a stopwatch ticking away but hes going nowhere fast
he futilely leans on the car horn
lyles surveillance shift
he takes digital photos with a telephoto camera
zooms in on a security pad on the front door
into micro cassette player advent home navigator hybrid system
monitors points for intrusion fire and environmental hazards
best way around it is to get a back door password trip the alarm during the heist then call it in as a false alarm
a hand turns the dial to a worthington vault
the vault opens and voila stacks and stacks of gold bricks
the same hand clutches a very heavy duffle bag
our view booms up to see steve three years older than when we last saw him his beard shaved away
through his digital camera lens lyle watches steve walk towards his car a ferrari barchetta pininfarina
its the first time hes seen steve in three years
into micro cassette recorder
there he is
hes gained to pounds living off our money
and handsome rob youre going to be pissed when you see his wheels
lyle watches the security guard hit a switch in the guard booth
the gate rises like the blade of a guillotine in reverse
the ferrari zooms away
handsome robs rental car is in the left turn lane waiting for the light to change
the light finally is a green arrow but the lady in front of handsome rob is so preoccupied with applying her make up that she doesnt go until he honks
but by then its too late as she makes it through the light but he doesnt
he checks his stopwatch
in a bikini stella lies on a lounge chair under a cabana reading a copy of vogue magazine
but as we take a closer look we see that shes really reading the owners manual for the worthington safe which shes inserted in the fold of vogue
he sees a latina housekeeper get into her car
into micro cassette recorder housekeeper leaves at
steve bangs a fist against the steel security door that covers the closed store
the steel door rises up and a ukrainian named yevhen unlocks another door
he is the gold dealer that philly steak told charlie about
youre right on time
yevhen is and like many in the gold trade there isnt a conspiracy theory that he doesnt embrace
as they make their way to a back room he keeps his mouth in overdrive all those poor bastards out there putting their life savings in banks and s ls
and mutual funds
what do they think that when the collapse comes they can depend on the government
i dont think so
steve motions to a security camera that looms down on them
is the camera off
just like you said
i never tape you you can see for yourself
steve sees the red light is off
he lays the duffel bag on a table unzips it pulls out three pound gold bricks with the face of a balinese girl stamped on each one
as yevhen inspects them governments are nothing more than puppets on the strings of the trilateral commission with their twisted gods
yevhen retrieves a briefcase opens it presenting steve with stacks of ben franklins worth
as steve inspects the cash i mean its so obvious that in a world where nafta can overturn the supreme court not to mention microsofts nefarious financial machinations this is
our only refuge gold
steve closes the briefcase
plus a little walking around money
a fender bender in the middle of an intersection has traffic backed up for miles
handsome rob checks the latest time on the stopwatch
through night vision binoculars charlie sees a different security guard open the gate as steve returns
he watches steve go inside his house
through the windows he sees him use a remote to turn on a tv
a freeway sign says union station mile handsome rob can see the exit up ahead but traffic is so backed up and going nowhere that it feels like its a
hundred miles away
and its not even rush hour
just life in l
idling on the freeway he looks at the drivers in the cars beside him
he sees a businesswoman reading the wall street journal
sees a man with his finger deep deep up his nose
wheres a grenade launcher when you need one
our crew walks along the pathways of japanese gardens that wind along outside the restaurant
its a breathtaking view from high in the hollywood hills
some tourists take in the vista
doesnt matter what time it is
its either bad traffic peak traffic or slit your wrists traffic
you gotta ride the metro rail man
im sure its ideal for carrying a ton of gold genius
whats your guesstimate
if we had all green lights fourteen minutes
but in the twenty times ive done it the average is thirty two minutes with a top time of fifty minutes
then well travel like rockefeller
they dont know where charlie is going with this but theyve been around him long enough to know its going somewhere
when cars first started catching on workers on tall ladders would use these swiveling colored boards for traffic signals
now whenever rockefeller would take the drive from his mansion to his office on wall street the workers would make sure that he got green boards all the way
how do we get all green lights
let me see what i can do
did you know that the first traffic signal to be patented was invented by a black man named garrett morgan
to charlie youre not the only one who watches the history channel
we still need an in to get the video blueprint
well never get by the guard unless theyre certain its legit
im thinking cable tv
we cut his cable he calls the cable company
we show up
send a cable technician into the house with a pinhole video camera while we get a feed through an rf antenna
who plays cable technician
steve thinks were all dead
but stella knows thats not exactly true
he doesnt think stella is dead he doesnt know her at all
if youre all dead i guess im the man for the job
are you up for it
in for a penny in for a pound
service trucks pull into the lot
technicians are getting out finishing their shifts
handsome rob behind the wheel
lyle shotgun aiming his digital camera at the exiting workers
im telling you
he claims he named it napster because his hair is so nappy underneath that cap of his
but i know the real reason
its because i was napping when he stole the idea from me
i shouldve been on the cover of wired magazine
would you clam up
youd give a woodpecker a headache
im the napster
youre the napster
heads up cable chick
they see a female service tech getting out of her work truck
lyle zooms his camera lens in on her adelphia cable work shirt
it has becky sewn in above her right breast
i wonder what she calls the other one
and its such a mystery why you dont have a girlfriend
i had a girlfriend
unfortunately even though the relationship ceased in an objective reality its still going on in my mind
tapping his head that womans lived in here rent free for four years
lyle takes a few more pictures of becky
all we need now is a work shirt like this one and a service truck like that one
you think stella will be able to pull it off
i have my doubts but theres no talking to charlie
maybe hes been inserting his hard drive into her software
clouds the judgment
he knows better than to mix business with pleasure
getting out of the car only im allowed to do that
where you going
to get a work shirt and a service truck
lyle watches him stroll over to becky and strike up a conversation in the parking lot
lyle cant hear whats being said but becky smiles and lest we forget his name is handsome rob for a reason
our camera follows a trail of clothes hastily littered that lead to the cable chicks bed
lit candles are on the bedside table
the couple is asleep under a tangle of sheets
handsome rob has clearly mixed business with pleasure
his eyes flash open
he slips out of bed
pulls on his pants
reaches into her pants and removes her key chain
he selects the key to her service truck and does an old trick he blows out one of the candles and presses the key against the warm wax making a
clear impression of the keys ridges
he returns the key chain
takes a couple more steps past her panties past her bra and
he snags her work shirt
then hes gone
using locksmith equipment he cuts a key that matches the impression on the candle wax
stella wearing beckys work shirt arrives before any other workers
using the key handsome rob made she unlocks the door to the cable truck and gets in
the cable truck pulls over
charlie and lyle climb into the back where they cant be seen
the cable repair truck pulls over parking down the street from steves house
charlie gets out
he quickly uses a crowbar to lift up a sidewalk cement grate that says cable on it
inside are cable wires that feed the street
he crouches over and uses pliers to disconnect one of the cables
he drifts into the kitchen for a cup of coffee
he hits the remote control for a tv
it turns on but theres nothing but snow
he goes into the living room and checks out the plasma tv
the cables not working in here either
he hits an intercom button on his telephone
a security guard answers the intercom
what can i do for you mister frezelli
the cables out
see if you can get someone over here to fix it
he finds the number and dials
lyle monitors a digital copy of the security guards call thats being routed to his laptop
then he takes off his headphones and tells charlie and stella whoa
ive never heard the muzak version of purple haze before
whens the appointment
thursday between a
charlie dials a number on his cell phone
the security guard answers the phone
yes im calling from adelphia cable
i understand your service is out and an appointment was set up for thursday
well we have a technician working in your area who finished with an appointment earlier than expected
will someone be there for the next hour
thatd be great
our technician will see you then
have a nice day
charlie hangs up
lets check the camera
stella youre going patriotic today
lyle puts an american flag pin on her work shirt
then he hits keys on his laptop and an image pops up on his monitor via an rf antenna the pov of the pin
hes got cable lines in the kitchen living room bedroom and a cable modem on the computer in the office
try to get a look at each room
and walk slowly or the image will streak
lyle hands her some papers
i printed these up to look like paperwork from adelphia
when youre done ask him to sign and date the bottom
stella looks very tense
how you doing
charlie seems amused by that answer
you know what fine stands for
fucked up insecure stella joins in with him
neurotic and emotional
they look at each other a moment
while the others deal with the cable handsome rob and half ear drive down sunset
heres our spot
they pull up in front of a strip joint
girls girls girls
half ear pulls a switchblade out of his boot and puts it in the glove compartment
handsome rob gives him a questioning look
philly steak said wed be frisked
outside the doorway of a back room theyre frisked by a burly man
hes very thorough digging hard into their crotches
scowls ygot a great job
pays the rent asshole
you got a problem talk to skinny pete
he opens the door to the where we meet skinny pete who is the fattest man youve ever seen
he takes up an entire couch in the rear of the room
his catchers mitt sized hands motion them to come closer
philly steak sent you
his voice is raspy its like a climbing ten floors effort just for this guy to get out the words
so was i right on about the gold bricks or what
thats really not what im here to talk about
philly steak said you could get us some supplies
the fattest man youve ever seen attempts a nod triple chins colliding like a train wreck
what do you need
a four inch can of nitramon
two triple charger chemical grenades
should we hang here
check out the dancers
nothings going down here
i dont shit in my own yard do you
no but i take a whizz off the deck sometimes
with his distended belly and bursting shirt his eyes glazing with repletion skinny pete writes down an address
five thousand dollars
and dont be late
looking at a monitor one of steves security guards sees the adelphia repair truck pull up to the gate
he hits a button and the gate rises beckoning it inside
stella heads up the driveway apprehension painted on her features
lyle is hidden in the back
she parks next to the ferrari and finds herself surrounded by the four rottweilers
they snarl and flash their teeth outside her door until a shrill whistle yanks their attention to where steve has just stepped out the front door
the dogs immediately back off
stella gets out of the truck as steve walks over smiling at her
she comes face to face with the man who killed her father
its all right
they wont bother you now
shes not sure shes going to be able to speak or pull this off
im used to running into all sorts of dogs on my job
he holds out a hand
she shakes his hand
she hates this feeling his skin touch hers but she cant betray her feelings
he stands there a moment
you want to show me the problem
she enters moving her body to give the pinhole camera a full sweep of the entryway
id like to check the cable modem first
lyle watches stella and steve on his laptop via the pinhole camera and hears them talking through his headphones
steve leads stella down the marbled hall
ill show you
they step into the she turns her body so the mini lens can stare at the gleaming black worthington safe
then she goes up to his desk and pretends to work on the cable line that feeds into his computer
he stares at her as she bends down
the cable guy who hooked this up weighed about pounds didnt wear any underwear and his pants slung a little too low if you know what i mean
she tries her best to ignore his flirtatious stare and his words
there we go
now onto the tvs
lyle sees a perfect view of the main hallway as stella walks down it
he escorts her inside
she works on the cable connection to the plasma tv
is it fixed
turn it on and see
back at the spot where charlie disconnected the cable
wearing a headset with a mic he gets the word from lyle now
charlie reconnects the cable just as steve turns on the tv and the picture is perfect
then it looks like youre all set
steve stares at her a moment
have we met before
shes hoping to get out as quickly as she can
i dont think so
sign here please
she hands him the paperwork and a pen
he signs it
you read my mind
i meant that i need you to put the date by your signature
its the th
i know what you meant
he smiles this might seem a little sudden but
would you like to have dinner with me
i dont think thatd be a very good idea
is there some kind of cable rule against dating customers
no its my rule
i dont accept dates from men ive just met
ive only known you five minutes
then i guess ill have to sabotage my cable over and over again until you get to know me better
hes being charming and she has to act like he is being charming but she really wants to throw up
look im just talking about dinner
its no big deal
if you dont like me you never have to see me again
you know im not going to stop until you say yes
stella drives in heavy traffic down sunset
charlie and lyle are in the back
i know it was tough in there
he touched my hand
and he came on to me
that slimy disgusting man came onto me and i had to pretend that i liked it
stella keeps her eyes forward on the road so charlie and lyle cant see her face
but charlie catches her reflection in the rearview mirror and watches a tear glide down her cheek
she wipes it away
you do know what this means
ive created our window of opportunity
when steve leaves friday night we go in
by the time he realizes youve stood him up well be long gone with the gold
a different world
a different vibe
that feeling in the gut you dont belong here
handsome rob drives half ear in the passenger seat
the guy makes jabba the hut look like a spokesman for the subway sandwiches diet
they pull over in front of the apartment building that pete sent them to
what do you think
im trying not to
half ear hits the buzzer for the apartment number on the paper from the fat man
the door to the building buzzes in response and they go inside
from behind closed doors tvs crying babies violent yelling
they start down a hallway
ahead of them a door opens and a suitcase is put in front of the doorway
the door closes
they dont even get a glance at whomever is inside
they go to the suitcase
half ear clicks open the lock for just a peek
he sees the goods
handsome rob starts to slide an envelope of cash under the door frame
its sucked out of his hand by someone on the other side of the door and disappears
half ear carefully deposits the suitcase into the trunk of the rental car
handsome rob closes the trunk
we crash and were a crater
they get into the car
handsome rob keys the ignition
the beam of his headlights illuminate two homeboys
two more step out of the shadows one right up to the passengers door window
that one taps a mm against the glass
half ear lowers the window
the homeboy pats one hand against the faux leather inside of the door his other hand clutches the weapon
whatd you put in the trunk
the homeboy bugging on crank is not one to be fucked with
just gimme the keys before i pop a cap in your head
handsome rob takes the trunk key off the chain and passes it over to half ear
who nervously drops it onto the carpeted floor
half ear reaches down for the key
but in the flash of an eye
moving so fast it almost doesnt register
we see him yank his switchblade from his boot unleash its blade and stab it down into the homeboys hand
the knife goes through his hand and lodges into the faux leather interior of the door
the homeboy suffers as half ear whacks the gun out of his other hand while handsome rob keys the ignition and guns it
the other homeboys are already popping off shots at the car with semi automatic handguns
half ear hits the deck
bullets slam into the trunk illuminating the darkness with streaks of light from the bullet holes
they barely miss the suitcase filled with explosives
the homeboy is still attached to the car door by the knife
his legs scurry to keep up with the moving vehicle but its going too fast so pretty soon hes being dragged
bullets whiz by him
he cries out in agony until half ear has the time to yank out the knife and the homeboy rolls away on the pavement
the car makes a sharp right at the next block and pulls over
the u haul is waiting for them
they get out of the rental car and open its trunk
half ear sees the bullet holes that surround the suitcase
an inch closer and they wouldve been a crater
they get in with the suitcase
charlie is behind the wheel hes been waiting for them
he hits the gas
they take off leaving the shot up rental car behind
looks like that went without a hitch
an edited loop of the exterior and interior of steves house plays on lyles laptop
the crew is huddled around
lyle whats the distance from the front door to the vault
lyle doesnt answer
handsome rob leans over to charlie
he only answers to the napster now
im not calling you the napster
you call him half ear
that wasnt my idea
and him handsome rob
thats only cause he is handsome rob
and im the napster
sighs gives in the napster
five hundred yards
so heres the riddle
how do we get over a ton of gold from the vault to the getaway car
how wide is the hallway
the video that stella got of the hallway plays on the laptop
lyle calculates only six feet
our view pushes in fast on stella
then tires spinning over a marble floor
then the sideview mirrors scraping wallpaper
then the thin car is like a missile firing right down steves hallway a hair raising fit
her idea brings a smile to her face
jack daniels straight up
we could rumble right up the front steps bring the getaway car right to the vault and then straight to union station
handsome rob likes it
well need three to hold the gold
parked in the lot are shimmering supercharged mini coopers a new model that still captures the legendary mini look and feel
half ear climbs in one mini
lyle into another
in the background a large window overlooks the lot
handsome rob fills out the paperwork on the mini hes renting while flirting with a petite counter babe
id say youre a maserati s
just cylinders but can go to in
as long as its a convertible i always like to have my top down
at the same time in the background we see lyle and half ears mini pull out of their parking spaces and back right into each other
just a little bumper hit
do you know them
they get out of their cars and start yelling at each other
never seen em before in my life
steve bangs a fist against the steel security door that covers the closed store
the steel door rises up and once again yevhen unlocks another door
and im in a hurry okay
it doesnt seem to matter if steves in a hurry or not yevhen still runs at the mouth while heading into the back room
of course the florida vote rigging was a cia and mob operation
with total disinterest that a fact
you want facts
fact cia officials were allowed free and illegal access to official election material
steve puts his duffel bag down on the table
once again he pulls out three gold bricks that each weigh pounds
now given the sordid history in miami of joint ventures between central intelligence and the mob which led to the unsuccessful attempts to kill fidel castro and the successful assassination
of your president john f
kennedy this conjunction raises numerous red flags
and id love to hear more about it but like i said
dont worry well have you out in no time
the cash is on its way
steve cocks his head as if he could not have heard right
on its way
my cousin is bringing it over
hes on his way
dont worry he will be here any minute
steve looks up to the security camera
the tapes off
believe me he doesnt want to be on video either
didnt i tell you many times that i never wanted to meet with anyone but you
yevhen sweats a bit
but its his cash
he uses me to launder money
im just a middleman
and a middleman is supposed to stay in the middle
but you were early
it will be fine
my cousins a cool guy
like i am
what you are is a dixie cup
yevhen smiles quizzically not sure if hes being complimented or insulted
before the words are out of yevhens mouth steve grabs one of the pound gold bricks and slaps it across yevhens face shattering his jaw
yevhens falls to the floor and steve lifts the brick again and rams it down onto his head with an ugly thud
he then takes the gold brick slathered in blood and places it back in his duffle bag
yevhens ukrainian cousin mashkov stares down at the corpse
steve is long gone
mashkov kneels down by the body and starts sobbing
mashkov walks through a living room past some lighting equipment and a video camera and we get just enough of a look to realize that a porno is being shot
here but he couldnt care less as he makes his way into the kitchen where his boss danya the owner of this house is eating a bowl of frosted flakes at the kitchen table
they speak in a colloquial ukrainian tongue that we subtitle
my cousin yevhen was beaten to death
thats what im going to find out
they stop talking for a moment as one of the actresses comes in plops herself down next to danya and pours herself a bowl of cereal
she puts her hand on danyas leg
shes young and its a disturbing image and we recognize her shes the hitchhiker who lyle passed in the taxi ride down figueroa street when he first arrived in l
danya goes back to speaking subtitled ukrainian
and what will you do when you find this piece of shit who killed your cousin
ill hack off his limbs and bury him while hes still alive
but now we should stop talking ukrainian its rude to my girl
switching to accented how are you tonight karen
then eat your frosted flakes
like tony the tiger theyre grrrreat
danya laughs pleasantly
such a perfect girl
but as she eats her cereal we see a troubled sad look on her face
the three minis are parked inside one red one white one blue
handsome rob and stella are doing custom work under the hoods
lyle is wearing the strap on laptop and typing away
half ear squeezes silver haliburton suitcases into the minis trunks as charlie enters how are our matchbox cars
dont let their size fool you
these were rally cars back in the day
mph horsepower do i get to drive one
because you cant navigate your way out of a parking lot
heres your ride
he pulls a blanket off a vespa
lyle points at half ear
but he ran into me
hes not driving either
to stella you ever got a speeding ticket
lets put it this way i can only get insurance through companies that advertise on tv at in the morning
i got us spots for three cars on a car carrier and five first class seats
train from union station to new orleans
thats norlins yankee
whats the word on rockefeller
the traffic control center is on the top floor of a building on olympic and grand
they get their data from pavement loop detectors and video image vehicle detectors
that info is fused together by specially designed algorithms to predict traffic conditions and control the traffic lights
so all i have to do now is change the data by creating my own algorithm
what can i do to help
i need to hard wire into the mainframes
housed in a towering building on the corner of olympic and grand in the heart of downtown l
our view rises up to the rooftop where we find charlie and lyle
our view moves in closer on charlie who adroitly picks the lock to an access door and they climb down a short set of steps into the from an equipment
bag charlie pulls out a silent power drill and uses it to remove an access panel from the ac vent
charlie leads crawling through this tight space his path illuminated by the thin beam of a penlight
a high tech setting with a half dozen workers overseeing the large traffic information monitors that display multiple images
our camera pushes in on the wall of monitors and then blackness as our view crosses to the where the tall mainframe computers are housed and running
we see that the ac vent to this room is now open since charlie and lyle have already snuck inside
they move fast
charlie removes the rear panels of the mainframes while lyle adeptly hard wires his laptop into the computers
the laptops screen lights up
charlie fits two false panels where the rear panels of the mainframes used to be
lyle pulls an innocent looking filing box out of his equipment bag
he places the box on a nearby shelf where it enjoys line of sight to the false panels
he punches a key on his laptop and the false panels and the filing box quietly clicks into action communicating with his laptop via infrared
his laptop now shows a guiltwork of thumbnail views from the traffic information monitors
typing commands lyle is clearly operating on a higher bandwidth than the rest us
b x ttratio where bi are fishers linear discriminant function coefficients spdrat is the speed ratio and ttratio is the travel time ratio
i have no idea what youre doing
just do it fast
he hits the enter button
we own this place
their motto never closed
never without a customer
the place has the same decor as it did years ago
its also a spot where everyone minds their own business
one of the old time waiters leads our camera to a table in the back where mashkov sits across from a lapd homicide detective
he slides over an envelope of cash and a photograph of karen
and this is the new girl
fresh off the bus
one of danyas guys picked her up hitchhiking downtown
the detective checks out the photo
those titsd make dracula rise from his coffin at high noon
theyre all yours saturday
you can do whatever you want to her
her name is karen
youre too generous
i needed a fast answer
and im the shell answer man
a guy who works the counter at your cousins shop told me that someone named skinny pete had been asking around about gold bricks with the face of a balinese
girl on them
same gold bricks your cousin was buying
you talked to this skinny pete
i thought youd want a shot at him first
handsome rob does some final tune ups on the minis
half ear loads a triple charger chemical grenade into a launcher
charlie steps into the u haul which is parked in here
lyle is fixing glitches on his computer program
stella is doing her nails
charlie looks at her
you want the safe cracked dont you
then i have to have perfect nails
square tips have a more even surface area
better grip no slipping
are you making this shit up
i just let you in on a valuable trade secret
steve called to confirm a reservation at agos
and as for your getaway not even rockefeller had it so good
hes getting dressed for his date
we can tell by the way he preens in front of the three sided full length mirror adorning himself in the most expensive fashion that he is a vain and
the three minis pull out of the warehouse and head off down the road
the u haul follows
leading the pack
he wears a headset and mic
he drives half ear in the passenger seat
got cha boss
she follows behind handsome robs mini
loud and clear
his vespa is parked in the cargo bay with his equipment
looking sharp steve gets into his ferrari
the u haul is idling on the side of the street about a mile down from steves house
the vespa is parked behind it
from up ahead we see the ferrari cruising down the winding road
as it passes by
lyle speaks into his headset for those about to rock we salute you
from side streets the minis converge on the road and head up towards steves house
he can feel the adrenaline already starting to course through is body
this is it guys
moment of truth
he takes a sharp curve
and the moment that steves house should come into view
he hits the brakes his expression turning to complete surprise
the neighbor across the street from steve is having the biggest party in town
the road is filled with parked cars and arriving guests
aint no way theyre blowing the gate launching chemical grenades or in any way robbing steves house in the midst of this
as he takes this in theres a knock on the window
sees a uniformed valet
rolls down the window
are you hear for the baxter party sir
we see the three minis pull tight u turns and head back the way they came
he slaps his hand against the steering wheel fuming
she already knows what hes going to say
ive got a date tonight
youll have to fake it
laugh at his jokes
you need him to ask you out again
a posh restaurant
as our camera finds stella and steve she is laughing at something he said faking her way through the date
theyre sitting at an intimate table
you really make laugh
he takes the lie like the compliment she wants him to think it is
so heres what i have lined up for after dinner
well go to club deep
the ferrari always gets me to the front of the line
well do a little dancing
i dont want to be out late
why the curfew
lets just say ive made some wrong calls in the past
i like to take things slow cautious
you have nothing to worry about
you can trust me
i trust everyone
its the devil inside them that i dont trust
that saying strikes steve
thats an interesting saying
he looks at her closely really closely
theres only person ive ever heard say that
used to say it all the time
this worries her
because of course she used to hear it from her father
who was that
under the table he grabs her by the wrist squeezes it like a vise
a man named john bridger
where did you pick up that phrase
i dont remember
youre hurting me
john bridger was a thief
and he had a daughter
about your age
he told me that she took over a safe and lock company that he used as a front
let go of my wrist
what is wrong with you
its just a saying
steves voice is calm so at ease that watching them youd think this was pleasant dinner conversation
no wonder i liked you right away
just like i liked your old man right up until the moment i shot him in the head
now tell me who youre working with and tell me the plan
do it now or well go for a ride and ill break every bone in your body
stella intentionally knocks over a glass of wine
it shatters on the floor
an emergency signal
charlie half ear handsome rob and lyle appear around the table
steve is shocked to see the men he left for dead three years ago standing before him very much alive
they pull up chairs from another table encircling him for a tense and pointed talk
something wrong steve
you look like you want to call ghostbusters
half ear furtively slides the switchblade out of his boot
shes coming with us
you got a problem with that
fine by me
but its you that has the problem
how do you figure
youve just blown the one thing you had going in your favor the element of surprise
and i was surprised
he laughs unpleasantly jesus christ when i saw all you guys come out of the woodwork
for a minute i thought maybe you were ghosts
but youre screwed now
an arrogant sneer a half ear did you figure out how to take care of my security guard
ill hire five more
at lyle you know how to bypass my alarm system
ill have a new one installed tomorrow
at handsome rob does it tear you up inside seeing what car i drive
ill buy a matching one in red
at stella you think you can crack my safe
youll end up the same way as your dad
then to charlie all smiles looks like good time charlies got the blues
you can wear that shit eating grin on your face but i know under that versace shirt youre in a cold sweat
and youre not going to sleep a minute tonight
cause you thought youd gotten away with it free and clear
you thought youd gotten rid of us
youre the one whos screwed
right to the wall
give it your best shot
ill outsmart you every step of the way
and this time ill bury you myself
taking the challenge get more guards
change the alarm
buy a dozen ferraris
well still be here
charlie grabs a bread stick off the table and goes
the others follow
the door bursts open as the burly man we met earlier is dragged inside at gunpoint
five ukrainians armed with mac machine pistols storm the room where skinny pete works
mashkov walks behind the posse
he carries a duffel bag
he takes in the sight of the fattest man hes ever seen
in accented english do you know who i am
you work for danya
and you are gonna be straight with me and everythings gonna be okay
you fuck with me i will be ruthless
i dont want you to understand
i want you to overstand
because if you dont overstand i will use this
mashkov nonchalantly opens the duffel bag and pulls out a short handled ax
skinny pete sees dried blood on the blade
someone was asking about gold bars with a balinese girls face on them
i want the name of this man
the sun shines over the ocean and the hotel
the crew is gathered
lyle monitoring digital surveillance on his laptop takes off his headphones
well we scared him alright
hes flying the coop
his security guard called brinks armored car service to confirm a p
pick up at his house then jetclub to confirm a md cargo plane departing from the imperial terminal at lax at p
howd we miss the first calls
they must have been cellular
the cargo plane is being chartered to mexico city
only place with worse smog and traffic than l
once the charters in the air he could change the flight path to anywhere
and good bye gold
not so fast
this is good news for us
sometimes when youre up to your ass in alligators you forget that you started off trying to drain the swamp
meaning what the fuck
weve been trying to get to the gold in the safe
now the safe is coming to us
well boost it in transit
he might as well have said theyll steal the holy grail before sunrise
he could take a dozen different routes to the airport and we have no idea which one
we cant take out an armored truck during rush hour
were already set to do it
napster how would you like to create the biggest traffic jam in the history of los angeles
you gridlock every route except the one we choose
force the truck to go exactly where we want it to go
but where do we want it
we cant shoot it out with armed guards in a brinks
and even if we pulled it off the cops would be all over us chasing us all the way to union station
were outmanned and outgunned
but not outsmarted
charlie hums with focused energy
theres a term for it in horse racing
when a thoroughbred is at peak condition and twitching with eagerness to run he is on the muscle
that describes charlie right now
well do it like the italian job
well make thirty million in gold drop out of sight
theyre interrupted by charlies cell phone ringing
this throws them all off
who else has this number
no one but us
its still ringing
charlie decides to answer it
meet philly steak
or at least meet the back of his neck
because thats where he has a tatoo that says philly steak
whyd you do it
informing the crew philly steak
then into phone do what
our camera tracks around to philly steaks face which is weathered and as leathery as a football
an old school crook
the ukrainian gold dealer
you didnt have to clip him for christs sakes
listen to me
youve gotta get out of l
whatre you talking about
we didnt clip anybody
well skinny pete just called me
yevhens cousin is under the distinct impression that you did
why does he think that
because you wanted to know about the gold with the balinese girl
plus i guess pete was under duress
this ukrainian thinks hes paul fucking bunyan
do you know how to get in touch with him
maybe theres a way we can play this to our advantage
are you out of your mind
listen to me charlie
get out of l
cause if theres one thing i know its that you never mess with mother nature mother in laws or mother fucking ukrainians
speaking of five ukrainians lock n load their mac machine pistols plus an m carbine with a mm grenade launcher mounted beneath the barrel
mashkov enters the room and tells the others in subtitled ukrainian
hes going to be on train for new orleans
you sure your source is good
the home where the porno was made
karen wearing a backpack stuffed with her only belongings creeps into the kitchen with two videotapes in hand
she sets them down on the counter
they say master tape on the labels
she opens the microwave oven
puts the tapes inside
sets the timer for minutes at the highest level and presses the start button
as the videotapes start to cook we watch karen flee out the door
the u haul is parked on the side of the noisy congested boulevard
a large metal sheet is now mounted on the side of the panel truck
parked behind the u haul are two of the minis and lyles vespa
we see traffic flowing through the busy intersection next to the vehicles
then we boom down really fast right into the black pavement and through the darkness and out the other side so we are now underground in the middle of the
where half ear is at work mounting nitramon primer to the tunnel walls charlie assisting
they both wear orange jumpsuits plus headsets and mics
did you know einsteins th grade teacher told him he was a moron whod never amount to anything
same as mine
still hope for that nobel prize
not me man
but i did get my college diploma
i thought you dropped out of high school
got my ged after italy then just kept going
howd you manage that all the jobs weve been pulling
quit going to strip clubs
went to night school instead
city college is all
good for you
thats a real feather in your cap
i didnt want to say anything to the guys
theres a rumbling sound in the distance
secrets safe with me
the rumbling grows unbearable as a metro roars closer headlights gobbling up the dark tunnel
they press themselves into a crevice in the wall
with a roar and a gust of wind the metro howls by
it makes their jaws clatter
stellas in the cargo area with lyle whos working his laptop
its monitor displays a string of computer code
he hears over his headset napster
how goes it up there
working on the metro rail system
handsome robs mini is parked on the side of the winding road
using binoculars he looks down onto oporto drive at steves house
into his headset everythings quiet here
the nitramon is applied
half ear closes his eyes
charlie observes him a moment
just need a moments meditation
im about to insert a wire into a detonator tube and if the wire touches the sides of tube well be blown to kingdom come
best to be at one with yourself
take all the time you need
another moment then half ear sets to work
charlie holds a mini flashlight illuminating the intricate detonator
very carefully he inserts a wire into a tube
remember the wire must not touch the sides
the wire is half way in when a large spider drops onto his hand
frozen he ponders this
charlie sees the spider doesnt know what to do
half ear studies the spider
then he closes his eyes just a moment
breathes in breathes out
and then he leans forward opens his mouth and clamps his lips over the spider comes back up
finishes inserting the wire
job done he calmly opens his mouth
the spider puts a hairy leg out and delicately explores his cheek
half ear plucks it off just as delicately depositing the spider on the wall
charlie just shakes his head in disbelief
my work here is done
a brinks truck climbs the road towards steves house flanked by two bmw k lta motorcycles
through binoculars handsome rob is still keeping an eye on steves house from the higher vantage point
the front gate rises
the brinks truck and motorcycles are let inside and head up the driveway
but then he sees a second armored truck drive up also guarded by two motorcycles
and a third brinks followed by motorcycles turns into the driveway
its a convoy of matching armored trucks
witnessing the twist of events through his binoculars
he speaks into his headset mic problemo
the rest of the crew is now all in the u haul
lyles manning the laptop
what is it
hes brought in three identical armored trucks
its like a shell game on wheels
how can i reroute the truck if i dont know which truck to reroute
the caravan of armored trucks and motorcycles now head down the driveway
the ferrari follows behind
handsome rob sees the vehicles head east on oporto
he reports into his mike three brinks trucks are leaving with motorcycle escorts plus steve in his ferrari
howre we going to figure out which truck has the gold
charlie is just as frustrated
but in a tight spot he always comes up with an idea
you can monitor the traffic video cameras from your laptop right
wheres the first camera the trucks will go past
lyle hits a command key and we now see the intersection of woodrow wilson drive and cahuenga where vehicles are driving under the traffic signal that a traffic video camera
is mounted to
they all have to cross that
the weight of the gold will lower the suspension on the truck
the first armored truck makes its way through the green light
lyle hits the keyboard and lines of measurements appear across the image of the brinks truck
he strikes another key momentarily freezing the image
he makes a visual check of the top of the armored truck against the cahuenga boulevard street sign
lines up with the top of the sign
he unfreezes the first image just in time to check out the next armored truck in line
the top of this truck also lines up perfectly with the top of the street sign
first two are the same
the third brinks truck makes its way through the intersection the ferrari behind it
the third brinks comes into the monitors view
the top of the truck is below the top of the street sign
thats our truck
license plate we see the truck with the california plate awp
our view rises up until were looking at an aerial view as the three armored trucks and their motorcycles fan out in three different directions with the ferrari going in
a fourth direction
handsome rob pulls up in his mini and parks behind the other minis
charlie gives the command
lyle executes hitting a series of keys and inconspicuous on a shelf the dummy file box clicks into action
in response the false panels on the mainframes hum to life and in the adjacent the mosaic of traffic screens spiral into darkness
the workers cant believe it
they start hitting their keyboards trying to get the system up and running again
but its useless since lyle controls the system now
a single mouse click loads his new algorithm into the computer and all the traffic signals in hollywood turn green simultaneously
see cars collide into each other
see a domino line of rear end crashes
a motorcycle tumbling over
the stymied workers watch helplessly
lyle quickly types out some words and the workers see the words form on the giant screens the traffic lights turn red simultaneously
then all turn green
then red again
its demolition derby time
daisy chains of wrecks
cars spinning like hockey pucks
total traffic meltdown
sweeping over a panoramic view of the greatest traffic jam in l
s history is traffic anchor christina griego
she reports what she sees this is christina griego with your drive home traffic report on knx
im looking down on hollywood boulevard and this is definitely a cig alert
theyre blocked in solid ahead and behind
what the hell
he turns on the radio as lyles fingers dance across the keyboard
opening up a space on north highland
stuck in the middle of it
the driver and guard both armed are as confused as everyone else
get us out of here
he sees a way out a sudden opening on north
via a traffic video camera lyle sees on his laptop the gold truck followed by two motorcycles making the turn onto north highland
hes taking it
lyle hits more keys
i now command you to turn left
it comes to the next intersection
every light is stuck on red except the left turn only signal which is green
the truck takes it
hes striking keys an orchestral conductor the crew his audience
ive got it on hollywood boulevard
time to slow down
signals turn green but only for three seconds long enough for one car to gun through it at a time
at the same time we see charlie get out of the u haul and climb into the first mini
stella gets into the second mini
half ear joins handsome rob in the third
steve gets the scoop over the radio
he cant believe it
according to the police the computers at the traffic control center are down
steve knows who did that
through his rearview mirror charlie eyes the gold truck creeping closer
gentlemen start your engines
starting their engines with souped up throaty roars charlie handsome rob stella
give us the flag when youre ready
lyle has hacked into the metro rails control system
starts his magic
shutting down the rail as we speak
a metro is speeding through the blue line tunnel
suddenly it loses power and comes to an inglorious stop
another metro stops on the red line
inside a metro on the westside corridor as it stops confused passengers stare out the glass
his laptop shows a group of still circles that represent the stalled metros
the three minis jump the curb and drive right over the star lined sidewalk
pedestrians throw themselves out of their path
the cars run over marilyn monroes star and the flowers and candles left by fans
they make a sharp turn down the cement stairs that lead to the metro rail platform
at the same time the creeping gold truck is just about alongside the parked u haul
through his sideview mirror lyle eyes the progress of the gold truck
he gives the word coming into position
the minis roughly bounce down the second flight of stairs
the sides of the cars scrape against the metal handrails
tourists workers all scamper away
the gold truck getting closer
the minis land on the platform where everyone is waiting for the next metro
heads turn at the sight of these half cars streaking by
the gold truck is almost alongside the u haul
charlies mini flies off the platform and lands on the rail line
the cars shocks take the hit
the other minis follow suit off the platform onto the rails
drive past the spot where they put the nitramon explosives
she brakes to a stop and braces herself as half ear pulls out his hearing aid hits the remote to a detonator and the section of pavement that the gold
truck sits on splits apart
the road surface drops away
smoke billowing up as the brinks truck falls
suddenly the street the armored truck and daylight come crashing down at us in a cloud of smoke and debris
the trucks windshield implodes
the minis come to a stop
half ear jumps out
aims the grenade launcher
the triple charger chemical grenade sails in through the windshield and explodes knocking out the guards
the driver slumps against the steering wheel the horn blaring under his weight
at the same time lyle hits a button on a remote control and clamps unlock releasing the heavy steel sheet from the side of the u haul
it slams down neatly covering the gaping hole in the road like a huge manhole cover
the motorcycles following the brinks come to a sudden stop
the motorcycle guards watch the smoke clear
the armored truck has vanished
vaporized in the gridlock
a man jumps out of his bmw and sprints away from the explosion
lyle gets out of the u haul and runs to his getaway vehicle the vespa
hes about to hop on but something stops him
the sight of the vacant shimmering bmw il parked just ahead keys dangling from the ignition
at the same time the motorcycle guards climb off their bikes
draw semi automatic handguns
result more madness bystanders flee
the bmw tears out of there lyle behind the wheel
the rear door to the brinks is open
our crew sees the worthington inside
well like einstein almost said genius is ten percent inspiration ninety percent detonation
lets get our gold
stella goes up to the imposing safe
gives it a look of momentary respect then sets to work
christina griego telling her radio audience ive seen earthquakes mudslides fires riots but this
let me try to paint a picture for our listeners
hearing the news over the radio
theres been some kind of an explosion and a brinks truck has just dropped down into the metro rail blue line
steve slams the car into gear and jumps the sidewalk passing the gridlock
he hollers into a walkie talkie the trucks in the metro rail
where does the blue line go back above ground
the motorcycle guards who were escorting the decoy trucks hear steve over their walkie talkies
with squeals of rubber they turn around as one of the guards answers it comes out at flower pico
at the same time stella works the dial feeling for contact points
and the two motorcycle guards fervently try to lift off the steel sheet that dropped down from the u haul
they see daylight start to stream in from above as the steel sheet slides a little
we hear stellas heart pounding in her ears
see the perspiration on her fingertips
you know when you said this wouldnt be the same as opening a safe for the cops
did you have to be right
the motorcycle guards strain managing to shift the steel sheet enough so they can see the armored truck below
close shots on stellas eyes pure concentration
close shots on each number on the dial
she grabs the safes lever and swings the sturdy steel door open
she instinctively looks away
dont you want to see whats inside
i never look
you wanna look
so she does
inside is a mountain of gold bricks
the motorcycle guards heave strain finally getting the steel plate off
but its too late as engines rev
hands slam stick shifts
the cars streak off deeper into the metro rail tunnel headlights bouncing off the walls
its a rush cruising down the tunnel
taking the blue line
leading the pack
but theyre not home free yet
rush hour gridlock no problem
the ferraris cylinder massive hp engine bellows as it hits m
in the breakdown lane
a highway patrol car starts chasing after it siren wailing
merging onto the south steve sees the patrol car in hot pursuit
he shifts into sixth and suddenly this car is a rocket blasting off doing a mile in
seconds leaving the patrol car far behind
at the same time mashkov and the other heavily armed ukrainians climb into a suv
the garage door opens and the vehicle charges out of there
and at the same time the three minis speed by underneath our camera in streaks of red white and blue
he spots the proverbial daylight at the end of the tunnel
where the blue line rises up to ground level
the minis thunder into the daylight past the above ground platform just as two motorcycles come flying around the corner after them
picture this two guards on each motorcycle with each man seated behind the driver holding ak s in each hand giving them the appearance of having submachine guns growing out
of their shoulders
fingers go flat against the ak s triggers
blowing shot after shot at the minis
bam bam bam
in the teeth of gunfire
bullets explode through the back window in a cacophony of crashing glass
a shot wings his door
into headset split up
they head off in different directions through congested downtown rush hour traffic
one motorcycle takes off after charlies mini
the other goes after handsome robs mini
so stellas free and clear except that steves ferrari is barreling down pico and coming after her
an lapd pilot swoops in barking out instructions to police cars converging on the scene
turning onto exposition the motorcycle in pursuit the chopper overhead
his red mini jumps a curve now on a wide sidewalk accelerating full throttle for the horizon while pedestrians flatten themselves against a high rise in fear
he sees someone give him the finger
mutters if you dont like how im driving get off the damn sidewalk
meanwhile hes got the other motorcycle on his tail relentless gunfire dogging his every move
he shifts smooth as silk squeezing between a car hes passing and an oncoming car in the other lane
half ear is trying his best to remain calm but jesus that was close
suddenly handsome rob veers off the road and wham
he takes down a chain link fence and is now in the parking lot of the his white mini catapults across the asphalt the motorcycle still right behind
up ahead he eyes the open door entrance to the convention center
stomps the gas
what are you doing
the turbine howls
what are you doing
the mini squeezes through the doorway and into the its the star trek grand slam convention in full swing
display tables are lined up in the cavernous hall and the mini snakes through the maze and the trekkies as the motorcycle follows right behind and the chase is really
thuda thud thuda the minis wheels climb a flight of steps
waves of people flee the path of the little car and thud thuda thud the motorcycle follows right behind
the mini zips down the wide concourse hall travels underneath banners of star trek characters that hang from the ceiling the motorcycle keeps up tires tearing into the carpeting
he shifts swerves avoiding people obstacles
go that way
handsome rob turns taking them down the that stretches out toward the staples center
the mini goes by
the motorcycle goes by
then the mini steamrolls through the exit doors and it bounds down outdoor steps and ramps onto the outside entrance to the staples center fitting snugly between cement pillars that
are designed to keep regular sized cars out
the mini bulldozes through glass doors
across the lobby
down an aisle that leads right to where our l
lakers are in the midst of practice
the minis do look like matchbox cars next to these towering players
the cars tires leave a streak of rubber on the parquet floor
the team clears a path
the car is off the court before they know it
but now the players see the motorcycle coming down the aisle
see the guns
see security guards running after it
kobe bryant picks up a basketball
the motorcycle charges across center court
hurls the ball
it rams into the motorcycles handlebars
the bike spins out of control and into a nasty fall spitting off the riders while the mini crashes out the opposite side of the arena and glides right through
sports arch of fame before escaping onto figueroa
meanwhile the ferrari is eating up the pavement as it hounds after stella
two police cars are roaring after them both
she slaps the gears into action maneuvers tight turns around the cars in her path just like she does at home with jack daniels
a cop car tries to pass the same car as the ferrari but smashes into an oncoming vehicle
as it spins like a corkscrew the rear tires spin smoke and it launches like a missile after the mini
she keeps flooring it
the gauge rising
the customized engine screaming
but the ferrari like an unstoppable force hangs menacingly in her rearview mirror
steve rams into the rear bumper of the blue mini
the bumper tears off rolls across the pavement
the ferrari is about to make another charge
she yanks the wheel left to avoid the hit
suddenly finds herself in the path of an arrowhead water truck
she yanks the wheel right to avoid a collision
the truck driver hits the brakes over compensating as he turns away from the mini and the truck falls over onto its side sending those big jugs all over the
road water exploding into the air and the ferrari crashes through the jugs one rolling up the hood and over the windshield dousing it like a car wash
the lane is blocked by the wreck
steve makes a right turn
the police cruiser hits the brakes but not fast enough
it slams into the water truck
steve turned onto a one way street and hes going the wrong way
a jeep wrangler almost runs into him head on but both cars stop just in time
the driver of wrangler a muscular fire plug of a guy jumps out furious
whats wrong with you you stupid ass son of a bitch dickhead
as more invectives are hurled steve gets out of the ferrari and walks towards the furious driver
you want a piece of me
bring it on
ill be pulling peanuts out of your asshole bang
steve shoots the guys foot
you shot me in the foot
while the furious driver hops on one leg steve gets into the wrangler and takes off abandoning the ferrari
at the same time lyles coasting down exposition boulevard towards union station
clear sailing for him
he sees a young woman thumbing for a ride
and he recognizes her she was hitchhiking when he first arrived in l
he pulls over
to lyle she might be an angel in the empyrean if she wasnt so completely a woman
where are you going
how about far far away
the farther the better
charlies still having a helluva time getting rid of the motorcycle
it screams like a banshee as it streaks up alongside the mini
charlie suddenly sees an ak pointed right at him
he jerks the steering wheel and swerves off the street driving through the parking lot of the historic hotel figueroa
with the motorcycle dogging his heels he looks up at the building
it has three towers that rise up stories with a giant mural of albert einstein covering one of the towers its an ad for apple computers think different
suddenly the lapd helicopter swoops down towards the parking lot shattering the air blowing up dirt and discarded newspapers in a rush of turbo wash trying to box in the
hes got no place else to go
the mini squeezes through the entrance and into the lobby with its exotic moroccan decor
horrified guests catapult out of the way
the mini drives past wooden statues potted palm trees
the motorcycle follows the car as it streaks towards the elevator
charlie looks back sees the motorcycle
the elevator door opens
some tourists step off
the mini darts right in not an inch to spare
charlie reaches out the window presses the button for roof
he sees the motorcycle charging after him burning rubber across the beautiful tiled floor
the door closes just in time
a second elevator opens the motorcycle zooms inside people screaming at the sight of the guns
the doors open ping and the mini reverses out spins
looking down onto the buildings rooftop we see that it is shaped like a capitol e three towers connected by a narrow strip
each tower has its own elevator
he wants to drive across the rooftop strip but theres a big problem the giant sign that exclaims hotel figueroa in red and white neon lights blocks so much of
the strip that even the mini couldnt squeeze through
in his rearview he sees the second elevator door open and out comes the motorcycle
hes trapped up here
but hes not about to abandon ship
so he floors it slaps the gears hurtles to the edge of the first tower and in his car hurls into the wide blue empty space
the ground deliriously distant
spiraling through the air like a football
the mini lands right side up with a thud
charlie rattled looks over his shoulder and sees the lapd helicopter rising over the rooftop turbines screaming
and here comes the motorcycle
flying from one section of the rooftop to the next
it lands and the driver revs it forward he speeds toward the edge of the roof and launches off towards the third tower some twenty feet away
keeps going to the last elevator skids to a stop
he reaches out punches the call button
then looks over his shoulder to witness going full throttle to make the final rooftop to rooftop jump
but its front wheel hits the edge slightly off kilter
it soars but with a slight downward trajectory
towards a large window on the top floor
and the look on the drivers face says it all as
the front wheel of the motorcycle smacks into the side of the building just below the window
the guards are flung off the bike and their bodies crash through the window as a hunk of exploding metal imbeds itself in the side of the lapd chopper and
the guards land in the tangier suite in a hailstorm of glass shards
smoke billows out where the hunk of metal hit
the pilot keeps it under control but its time to go
with a whining throb the injured chopper banks away
the elevator door opens
charlies mini shoots out then skids out the lobbys exit
he made it
she checks the rearview mirror
no sign of the ferrari
just a jeep wrangler back there
stella looks relieved
feels like shes home free
stellas mini pulls up to the ramp of the enclosed car carrier at the end of amtrak train bound for new orleans
she can see the other two minis are already inside
she gets out and hands the cargo loader a ticket
the all aboard announcement goes out over the pa system
then the superliner train pulls out of the station quickly picking up speed
the outside streaks by through the window
its a happy crew
champagne is poured
charlie holds up his glass and gets their attention
i want to make a toast
cause theres somebody missing here today and we all know who it is
they all raise their glasses
to john bridger
the most brilliant master planner of them all
we wish he was with us
we pan across their faces
its been a three year odyssey for them
they got the gold but they lost someone they loved
our camera moves past the three minis parked inside
and stops at the last car in the carrier the jeep wrangler
its rear hatch rises and steve creeps out
he walks over to stellas mini
pops open the trunk revealing a silver haliburton suitcase
he unzips the case
its filled with stacks and stacks of gold bricks the exotic face of a balinese girl on each one
steve pulls out a brick embraces it
he knows his gold
these bricks are real
but as he has a moment with his gold behind him the trunks of the other two minis rise in unison
then mashkov rises out of the trunk of the white mini
another ukrainian rises out of the trunk of the blue mini
four more ukrainians slide out from underneath the minis
they cock their m lls
steve hears the sound from behind him
he turns around to see the weapons pointed at him
take out your gun and drop it on the floor
steve has no choice
who are you
you knew my cousin
i never knew anyone named yevhen
get in the trunk
not that trunk this one
that gold is for us
a gift from some old friends of yours
they said to tell you that they didnt mind sharing the box of cracker jack as long as you didnt get any
not even the toy surprise
the ukrainians force steve into the trunk of the white mini
and for the first time hes scared
looking up at mashkov he begs
dont shoot me
that wasnt the deal
im not going to shoot you
to the others he really thought i was going to shoot him
the ukrainians laugh
steve tries to laugh
im not going to shoot you
im going to hack off your limbs and bury you while youre still alive
and with that he closes the trunk
like the lid of a coffin
and for steve the world falls into blackness
underneath the crews seats we see the other two silver haliburton suitcases filled with the rest of the gold
we boom up to our five thieves
handsome rob passes out new fake drivers licenses for when they arrive in new orleans
re his fake license simon quackenbush
could i just once have a cool name
also complaining pounds
theyre interrupted by the ring of charlies phone
did you get what you wanted
mashkov is on the other end of the line
during this lyle types commands into his laptop that is connected to a phone jack in the car
it was good doing business with you
lyle hits a final command and signal box receives the command and the coupler between the car carrier and the rest of the train is electronically disengaged
this causes the train to separate from the car carrier
the train speeds on without it at miles per hour
the car carrier slowly comes to a stop in the middle of nowhere
the dining car features crisp white linens and extended windows for scenic dining
lyle walks over to a table where karen is waiting for him
she looks resplendent
is this seat taken
it is now
and as our camera holds on lyle ready to embark on a new life we it fills the screen
and beneath a photograph of lyle himself we read the headline how the laptop fugitive pulled it off and as our camera finds half ear checking out the books in
the library feeling like the wealthy man he is we and beneath a graduation photo of half ear in his cap and gown we read the headline professor relives memories of erudite fugitive and as our camera finds handsome rob whos already caught the eye of a woman at the bar we and beneath a photo of becky the cable chick we read the headline feds say technician admits to encounter with handsome thief charlie and stella drink from glasses of champagne
we did it
we sure did
theres something ive been meaning to ask you stella
but ive just been so busy lately what with the explosion car chase ukrainians and all
it has been a hectic day
its about that thing you said to me back in philadelphia
you said that you cant have a relationship with a pickpocket gold robber or any kind of thief
do you still believe that
well i was wondering
what about a retired pickpocket gold robber thief
now thats an entirely different question
and as an enigmatic smile settles across her face we and beneath a photo of sunbathers on a glorious beach we read the headline and our view slowly pushes in
closer on the magazine cover
closer on the line of sunbathers
panning across their faces and youd never notice unless you were really really looking for them
is it them
closer on the pixels
and yes it sure is
charlie stella in lounge chairs living the good life
