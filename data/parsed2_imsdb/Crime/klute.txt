href b b klute close shot of tom grunemann attractive young executive sitting at the head of the dining room table carving a turkey for thanksgiving day dinner
there are joyous sounds of celebration
the camera pans around the table revealing the happy family and guests
among them are klute and cable
camera stops at mrs
grunemann who sits at the foot of the table opposite her husband
she smiles across at him with pleasure
we cut to tom grunemann smiling back at her
we cut back to a closeup of mrs
grunemann looking back at her husband with love
we cut back to tom grunemanns chair only now it is empty
the joyous sounds disappear on this cut
it appears that tom grunemann has disappeared before our eyes
one moment he is there and the next moment he is gone
the camera pans back down the table only now it is empty except for grunemanns children and mrs
she is now dressed in something dark
she and the three children sit eating another meal in emptiness
she has changed from a joyous woman to a woman bereaved
the industrial frontier
special agent ross steps into frame glancing perhaps idly a little impatiently in this direction at some loud industrial goings on just beyond camera then returns toward group
the group includes cable and a younger fbi agent with clipboard to whom klute is supplying preliminary data
klutes manner is somewhat rumpled awkward
with a k
k l u are you with plant security sergeant
shakes head town police
then how are you involved
slowly i know tom grunemann
shortcutting again you knew the subject thomas grunemann
we grew up together
can you account for his disappearance in any way
did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed
aside to younger agent recording indicates no did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here
moral or sexual problems or peculiarities
marital problems in general
indicates possibly am i right sergeant
everybodys got some i guess
did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in new york
examine this letter please
continues we recovered that from the shredder the plant disposal and incinerator system
grunemann apparently typed it friday before he left decided not to send it tossed it away
weve already contacted the new york police they think they know the girl in question
we see a controlled incredulity and revulsion
he never mentioned this type thing to you
you didnt know he had these interests
holly thrusts the letter back toward camera toward klute crying out my husband was not like that
my god klute
it looks like he sent her quite a few of those holly the girl she recalls six or seven letters like calmly no
i mean sure a little rough stuff but just what people usually no i wouldve said we were pretty good
pause johnnie i dont understand
i just dont understand
she is talking for both of them
klute looks out the window to the children playing outside
camera pans out window to klutes pov of children playing on a cold winter day
the trees are stripped bare
tree lined area lush and green summer
camera pulls back inside window to klute staring outside as if still pondering the fate of tom grunemann
the group in the office includes ross holding a report trask a new york detective cable and the plant director streiger
has disclosed no evidence of crime or criminal intent within the jurisdiction of this bureau and since subject thom turns sharply interrupts its been almost a year
tom grunemanns been missing for a year
and all the fbi has to offer is a report that must bore even you
restraint well sir
are you closing the case
no sir we dont state that
were countin but you dont find it worth much effort
injured dignity well mr
cable youve got me here from the bureau
you got lieutenant trask here from new york representing his department and i dont frankly consider moderating suggesting why couldnt you ever find out anything from the girl
refers the question trask summarizes from notes we first hold her under surveillance expectin your boy grunemann to show up there
then we bagged we arrested her on a cp charge convicted two months womens city prison offer to reduce sentence she cooperated
counts four interrogations
she thought she remembered grunemann from those letters from before she made that connection but she hadnt seen him since and couldnt identify his photograph and she why not
oh a good call girl shell turn six seven hundred tricks a year
the faces get blurred
resumes and since then recent months shes reported several you know incidents like breather calls anonymous phone calls also somebody maybe following her watching her things like that
so its i guess you could say conceivable grunemanns still around there just hangin around her spooking her
but you know that he shakes his head gestures doubtingly
ross caps it
the subject got emotionallv disturbed he just dropped out
inspector we understand your position ours is a little different
we have an investment in tom grunemann
the company has an investment and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves
private investigation you mean
yes sir of course youre entitled and theres some very competent klute offered us his services weve accepted
ross and trask look at klute more than a bit startled then at each other
klute just looks uneasy
klute knew tom
he has a great many ideas about the case sourly yes sir we know he wed expect him to work in cooperation with you
hed report to each of you and to our companys new york office to pete pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth and tactfully mr
streiger speaking frankly weve appreciated the sergeants interest you know all along
but new york thats well to klute leniently ever done any missing persons work
spent much time in the city
to others you see i have to wonder speaking frankly the sergeant knows im only speaking frankly you wonder why we thought of klute
verdant pennsylvania farmland
near at hand an open field set about with bee hutches and patched with mist
a figure a shadow klutes actually moves across frame from the left blanking in
we reorient to we see that weve been looking out from the bedroom window of this house
klute turns to rolltop desk in bedroom and picture of tom grunemann picture of bree daniel and other material he has collected on the case
he puts them in his suitcase and closes the suitcase
he shuts rolltop desk
we follow klute through the house with suitcase
he puts away a last dish shutting off water gas and electricity and so on takes a last look around reaches for the door handle
we cut to a section of wall a door coming open and the figure of bree entering and standing
we have gone from the warm sunlight of the country to mustv darkness
she appears chic poised and perfect as a magazine picture
but as she gets used to the darkness and her eyes focus on a line of equally beautiful girls sitting and waiting in folding chairs along a wall we see
that she is a great deal less certain of demeanor
we cut to klute stepping out closes locks and checks the house door then moves on to his car a vintage plymouth and tosses in his suitcase and then takes
a last turn around the yard itself props open the cover of a beehutch and lets down the rail gate of a sidefield
he approaches to roll shut his barn door and on this action we cut again to hastily honey no we dont have too many
she slaps the cup down hurls herself forward swish pan onto a male actor thrusting him down to the floor her hands at his throat
as we widen to include director and more of scene and as the director reads from script supplying a narrator voice now before it comes to that lets have a
look et cetera et cetera bree and the male actor relax slightly as we reestablish the scene a few pieces of film equipment and the congery of other actors and actresses preparing to read for parts
as the director approaches counsels bree all of this quick and consecutive honey you make it look a little real
it should have you know that fun to it
beat strangle him to death funny
well we go from this into stomach diagrams
it cant be too look lets try it again from but then he glances at his watch and at the others waiting their turn
no just give us the faces at the end would you
bree and the male actor set their cheeks together beaming half moon smiles to camera hold it for a moment as the director reads again reads and another family saved
by elso tablets
ok brightly thank you very much
and holds out his hands for their scripts at the same time as he summons from a list in his other hand pierce danner bree passes a new group of
beautiful girls sitting in line waiting their turn as she exits as brightly as possible
they trudge along the sidewalk the herd the late afternoon crush
a long lens shot the crowd compacted
we see bree milling along with the rest
she maneuvers to a sidewalk phone booth enters
we see her deposit dial
she is connected to her registry
bree daniel any messages
waits none ok thanks
she waits for a moment
then makes a curious small gesture of her hand deposits another dime dials again is answered
oh no just a commercial i thought i might get thats all
quickly more brightly well id take a quick thirty hon
do you have a commuter for me
as she prepares to write it down we cut back to klute finishes rolling shut and padlocks the barn door
he returns to his car sits in leaving door open starts engine
again one last time the look around
then he pulls the door shut pulls out
and on this we cut to a group middle aged couple child bellman with suitcases wait to descend in elevator as bree gets off
we track with her along corridor to a door
she checks number and knocks
a man opens the door
we neither see or hear him clearly he is foreground defocused
his shirt is untucked
bree cocks her head greets him cutely
he mumbles some kind of greeting steps back
she pauses a moment in the door casing instantly then quite confident friendly provocative all at once ooh i knew id like you
and cut to klutes car draws through the business section of town moves on c
bree the man out of frame and unheard from as she bargains gaily and at the same time a little watchfully
lover thats got to be a little extra
i mean it sounds very exciting what you speak of youve got me all excited
but something special like that you know its got to cost a little more mm
and cut to klute has laid his jacket aside rolled his sleeves is eating the last of a vending machine sandwich
the car radio is on
he leans forward tuning it from energetic r w m radios voice is the shippensburg valley on a beautiful clear warm thurs to rural tucky wonder beans picking up a
half cent over yesterdays price at and cut to the mans face is buried against her neck her labors over her
she cries out ecstatically transportedly it would seem at the edge of orgasm oh lover oh its too much oh you thrill me yes like that its oh its beautiful
oh and at the same time refers privately to her wristwatch
and cut to as klutes car drives onto the turnpike surrounded by green country we zoom into a close shot of klute through the windshield of his car
and then in what seems like a continuous shot we zoom back to a wide angle revealing klute caught in the endless line of cars in a typical traffic jam
at the entrance to new york city surrounded by smoggy grey urban skies
klute sits inside his car as it is mechanically lifted into the air
it looks as if he is being manipulated by a robot
bree moves along street returning home apprehensive of the one or two other distant figures
she turns in at one of the brownstones
we watch bree as she mounts to the top floor the door of her apartment barren isolated frightened
bree unlocks the door switches on a light cases the apartment for a moment before entering securing chain lock putting aside her things
there is a record player near the first interior doorway
she switches it as she moves by
by time the first record has dropped she has the shower turned on is getting rid of her dress
we cut back klute walks as before carrying his suitcase
we see him slow concernedly looking toward bree sits on a studio couch near the record player with a quilt huddled over and around her her back against the wall
the music is classical curiously the sound of a harpsichord
she is more or less expressionless but trembling violently shaking
brees apartment bree day bree moves about energetically preparing to set out on rounds
a knock on the door
she startled then approaches to door to peep hole lifts lid aside
klutes face is somewhat distorted by the peephole lens he is gazing mildly about the landing
through door curtly what is it
my name is klute john klute she turns the door handle parts the door about three inches looks through at him
he starts to enter
can i talk to you
and the door crunches against its chain lock
he stops perforce a bit startled
a slice of brees face looks coldly out at him
he summons a smile
my names john klute
you said that
im an investigator
id like to ask you some questions about tom grunemann
she tightens again
he wrote you some letters
he was a research engineer at the tuscarora laboratories in pennsylvania
he disappeared from there last april
ive been hired to look for him
you know what im talking about
will you let me ask you some questions
gumbo southern dew yew hayuv ah dentifikyshun
he takes out a folded letter and a wallet and passes them both through to her
she examines them with care then appears to soften a little even smiles slightly
youre not police or fbi youre just a private investigator
and you just want to ask me a few questions
she smiles again hands the letter and wallet back out closes the door doesnt slam just closes
klute looks at it blankly for a time starts to knock again decides not to turns and descends the stairs
bree listens through the door to his departing foot steps
they fade from hearing
she hastens to assemble her properties
klute comes out door and descends the stairs at the same even pace he walks into the vacant store below
it had once been a boutique that sold happy clothes
there are some psychedelic posters and a few remnants of its former identity
klutes suitcase is propped open on a cot behind a counter
the ceilings are low forcing klute to stoop as he enters
he seems out of place and out of scale
a case containing a tape recorder stands on the floor
on the table are a folder of klutes notes and a paper bag
klute enters and deliberately resumes his settling in
from the paper bag he sets aside an electric fan then lifts out from the shopping bag a cheap tin alarm clock and begins winding it
bree has shifted position to a window is looking down at the street
she sees and we hear sound of bus approaching distantly
she grabs her properties whips out the door
bree skids to a stop just inside the door scans quickly out in one direction then the other in case klute has been waiting in ambush on the sidewalk then
races pan to bus at curb makes it pulls herself aboard klute has been watching from his window
we hear the bus pulling away
he turns back plugs in the electric fan
then hoists the tape recorder unsnaps the cover
we see clearly what it is
bree is showing her notebook to an agent
he leans forward courteously occasionally stroking his forehead with his fingertips a nice man with a headache
and i take acting classes with lee tainter lee yes and i was in two of his workshop type productions uncle vanya and the girl in five characters indicates picture
here and then of course i have the modeling and the demonstrator work the trade fair work but naturally i feel ready for something more well you know sustain well thanks very much for coming in
she starts for the door hes already turning away then ducks back hands him one of her glossies laughing prettily at her own forgetfulness
beautifully the business thank you very much
bree comes out pauses with notebook to cross out the call completed checks the list of those remaining sets forth again
we hear trasks voice over very quick very clipped
man just a poor pretty little hooker like to be an actress closeup photograph of dead man
it is replaced with series of photgraphs of dead men
camera pulls back to reveal klute flipping through the file of the unidentified dead
what you lookin to get from her
you think shes got grunemann hid somewhere the attic feedin him soup
or maybe hes hidin in a dark alley and hell jump on her and you jump on him
and third place even if she does know somethin shes right she dont have to talk to you
you dont have police power you cant make her
klute closes the file
thats a lot of people to die unknown
unknown unidentified and unwanted
and theres more every day man theres more everyday
as klute slowly walks away we bring in telephone ring and bree voice over answering
then yeah hi hon
camera is looking up through lighted window outside at bree on phone
oh hon i just dont know
im trying to stay out of it
camera pans down from brees window to klutes window at the bottom revealing klute at tape recorder
the tape recorder is going its light winking
klute holds headset against one ear makes a note or two
we hear brees and other girls comes in with these other yulds maybe two or three times a year and five big ones baby just one evening
marta thanks and id love to party with you hon but klute sets down the headset we drop the voices far under indistinguishable makes a note and thumbs open the
box of a fresh reel the present reel is near the end
we establish a pile of already recorded tapes
we cut back to well try to get someone else marty and if i change my mind sure hon bye
she hangs up starts away
the phone rings again
she tries to ignore it
she finally turns back to answer it and we cut to camera starts on huge photo montage of the family of man and pans down to a group of beautiful
girls sitting on a bench below
they are dwarfed by the enormous picture
each one clutches an almost identical portfolio of pictures in her lap
camera pans down row of portfolios until it stops at bree impatiently waiting her turn
we continue the telephone voices over wild track style
the mans voice is thick with drink and emotion
first the click then bree daniel oh god baby oh god i really love you
thats nice who is this
i really love you baby you know that
a click and the mans voice continuing trailing into helpless sobs hello
oh my god hello
bree comes out from the building note possible costume change not necessarily consecutive action checks off on her list continues on her way as we continue wild track style voices
starting with a click and bree daniel
nicely bree frank hanley you remember fayetterville
oh yeah hi frank sure
well im in town like to see you
well frank thats awful nice but im out of action sort of you know we fade this conversation under but hold continuing as bree passes camera and we pan to
shot of klute at corner unseen by her and apparently in surveillance of her
then he too turns out of frame and we cut to camera is looking down at an enormous gift package on a platform
there is a sound of a recorded fanfare and with the pull of a string the package is opened revealing a brand new lincoln continental convertible
people applaud and the car starts to revolve
at the wheel of the car sits bree
we cut to a shot through the windshield of car a sea of staring faces revolves around her
we cross fade with spangler voice over as if recalling a case record
bree daniel caucasian twenty eight good physical health no narcotics record presenting an unusually strong personality some ways high intelligence a high bracket call girl
spangler a prison psychiatrist sits on a bench eating a sandwich partially wrapped in wax paper and sipping from a carton of milk
he is obviously a man pressed for time
klute sits beside him
across from them some prisoners are taking their exercise
through the metallic netting that surrounds them we see the skyline of new york city
it only dramatizes more the sense of being caged
usual case history this isnt a medical confidence its all of them broken family lonely confused crummy childhood early promiscuity formal prostitution beginning in her teens income twenty five to
thirty thousand a year
notes klutes reaction oh they dont keep the money they get rid of it they get pimps
stabs at record why do you want to know all this
i want to know how tom grunemann got mixed up in it
did she talk about him to you
about his letters thats all she remembered
quite violent material id say obsessive a quite sick man
but thats not unusual either
has she talked with you since prison
she had every good intention of it coming to me as a private patient getting out of the life devoting herself to an acting career
i think shes trying that
oh sure they try
the idea of a better life
but they dont really know much about life they get confused or scared or frustrated or bored they pop back to the one thing they can handle
men in bed
not men in general not life not love not even real sex it avoids all that
just the trick the transaction
pov world revolving around bree through windshield of car
the circular motion slows down and then stops
cut to bree getting out of car and walking off platform
she looks a bit shaky
she is stopped by one of the spectators
tapping her we had a bet on if you were real or not
she looks at him in disgust and crosses to phone booth
on phone marta we are in the interior of what was once a church and is now a discotheque
interior is painted purple the record player stands on the altar over the crowd
pews are massed around the dance floor
stained glass windows are lighted from behind and are circled with light bulbs that flash on and off
for all of its obviously bizarre visual quality there is a sense of relaxation
it is a late night gathering place of many who belong to the sexual underworld of the city
bree and the other girl advance to a pew
a man sitting there the other girls pimp with a third girl
brees companion greet him shyly tenderly she and bree sit down join in conversation
pull back slowly other pews other girls and a few men the sisterhood to among the people around the bar pimps whores and a sprinkling of hopeful johns and curiosity
the camera picks a familiar face cable
he watches bree with a mixture of amusement and contempt
a girl comes over to him and tries to proposition him
they appear to be discussing price
just as she thinks it is set he walks away
closeup photograph of tom grunemann pinned to a large piece of beaverboard klute has placed on a wall
camera pans over various pictures and pieces of evidence klute has pinned up in an attempt to make some sense from the puzzle of tom grunmianns disappearance
camera pans over to klute sitting on cot looking up at the pieces of the puzzle
there is a heated tv dinner in front of him
the tape recorder reels start turning sound powered the recording light starts winding as bree above dials
klute pays it scant attention he can catch up with the news anytime
he sits manfully in front of the tv dinner starts peeling back the foil she holds the phone is answered
her voice more natural a little shy a little covert
is greeted hi
well i could come over tonight if youd like if theres no one else
laughs diffidently i really want to just talk to you
the tape recorder continues turning and winking as the conversation upstairs continues
klute looks at tv dinner
he reaches for the headset of the taperecorder holds it loosely against one ear
he exhibits a measure of new interest
the tape recorder stops running
he immediately rewinds and starts listening through it again
we cut to large dark buildings a dim lighted window showing at an upper floor of one the street otherwise by and large deserted
a taxi draws in a figure in evening dress bree gets out approaches the building glances around either secretly or apprehensively presses a buzzer waits gets answering clicks enters the
dark hallway of the building starts upstairs
klute shifts into view looking in the direction brees gone a little puzzled all in all
he doesnt immediately follow he waits
we look past racks of clothing as bree arrives up the dark stairway into dark rooms the scene mysterious a little sinister
she seems fearful of it herself advances slowly looking around calls hi
faber is silhouetted for a moment standing watching her from along an alleyway of garments
she sees him is startled then relieved
oh he moves toward her
faber is a man of or so rather handsome and for this occasion very spruce very erect very nattily turned out
bree complains cheerfully
you scared me mr
he smiles kisses her cheek tests the fabric of her evening dress in passing as a matter of expertise
good material not too good cut
id do better for you
then he turns lifts down a womans dress cape carrying it graciously gestures her to precede him a dim pool of light here
a private area here sectioned off by rows of garments
a couch rug coffee table a chair or two a place for buyers to take their ease
bree and mr
her manner is suddenly elegant assured regal his befits a man of the world
he fits the cloak around her shoulders and gestures to the couch she sits
he pours a glass of wine for her for himself
she speaks with a neat continental accent doing it fairly well really a member of the international set
oh thank you
he sits in the chair opposite sips his wine
then well diffident its good to see you
well could we do it first and then just talk
sure dear yes
well well im just back
and i must tell you something quite wonderful
and cannes was quite fun quite and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me but a young man can be
so silly mm
and then one night at the gaming tables well i just saw him
a stranger looking at me and i knew suddenly that all my life id been she hesitates strangely her fingers at the neck of the cape
faintly may i
its so quickly please she stands unloosing the cloak letting it fall on the couch
but she doesnt sit again begins to move here and there about the enclosure her hands wandering about her dress and body an erotic restlessness
not young he wasnt young gray at the temples he well actually he looked like you
and nobody could tell me who he was an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or but i felt it stirring inside me this this wild pagan feeling
klute arrives from across the street
it takes him a while with a loid probably to slip the lock
he eases door open moves inside bree is farther along in her narrative more fervent in manner
faber sits at the edge of his seat ducking his head now and then in pleasure but making no move to molest her
and next day at the beach our beach pavilion i saw him again his eyes burning into me
i was helpless
without his even speaking to me without his even touching i knew that somehow somehow she casts away an accessory garment
faber burns her with his eyes klute mounts into view at the head of the stairs prowls along the aisles of clothing looking sees klute sees mr
faber first clearly a senior citizen sitting transfixed fastened in some private dream
then bree drifts into view stands lets fall the evening dress about her ankles poses drifts out of view again klute watches in that direction a moment longer
in his expression a certain curiosity a prurience but rather more strongly disappointment a measure of disgust
not his affair
he turns away from it into camera and near the entrance outside the door to klutes apartment below
we open on bree
she shouts angrily miserably whynt you just cut out
we widen to include klute
now she begins to get it
he turns opens door to his room below
she comes slowly down steps
she steps in the door looks slowly around at his various appurtenances the bed the necktie over the mirror etc
and then the tape recorder and then the stack of tape boxes
softly venomously oh you bastard
but then she adjusts a frightened but matter of fact hooker is it the shakedown hon
you picked a loser i just dont have it
no im look vehemently again if i was taking calls full time would i be living in this kip
id be back on park avenue i could support the whole national guard
gestures upward could i ask some questions
or youll get me shoved back in the brig you mean another month with the bull dykes
she seems to have expressed it the balance of power
she turns goes out heads upstairs
klute unhurriedly takes up his folder of notes then follows
bree disposes her belongings
klute moves to table
there is a group of plants on the table that long since died of neglect
he notices them and the disorganization of the room without comment opens his folder rummages for the photographs
then exasperatedly look i told the police everything i dont even remember the schlub
klute doesnt respond
klute sets out a photograph for her to look at
they showed me that one
i understand its grunemann but i told them i just dont remember
klute tosses down a second photograph
tom grunemann elaine grunemann two daughters
cool a family sort of man
klute grunts meaning yes
she echoes his grunt meaning we dont know what
he tosses another an everybody over here fellow employees sort of picture
including the figures of streiger and cable among many others male and female
the usual impedimenta picnic baskets balls bats a held sign tole american
klutes finger indicates tom again
she looks at the picture briefly at him questioningly
company outing or picnic or something like that
isnt that sweet
then well it could be any one of them bubi i get to see them all
she separates from klute around the table but remains standing restless
klute puts photo aside prepares to take notes as she pleads look please will you just try to get it from my side
a year ago
i was in the life fulltime
i was living on park with leather furniture and a million dresses
then they dropped on me the fuzz they caged me they started asking me about a man some man im supposed to have seen a year before that
two years ago two
he could be in yemen
she waits for klute to respond he doodles permissively on his pad of paper she goes on
and they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing
then they asked me well had i been getting letters from someone out there in cabbageville tuscarora all right yes i had been
those sick wild letters im watching you gonna follow you gonna punish you kill you et cetera
well they said all right thats grunemann
so try to remember when you and he when well i dont know there was that dumper once he sounded like that dumper explains dumpers they get their kicks beating
a man hired me once then tried to really kill me thatd be about two years ago
without warning she wheels to the open windows and shouts out full voiced both startling and somewhat intriguing klute shouts ok tommy baby allie allie in free kid i got
turns around again to klute
cheerfully you remind me of my uncle
then what do you remember about that dumper
except he wasnt kidding
usually its a fakeout you probably know
they pretend to tie you up and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you beat hell its their money
ill hang from the shower rod and whistle maytime
except this guy was really tripped out on it he but you cant say that dumper was tom grunemann
i cant say he was anybody
a brief pause
klute sorts his notes
she may take it that hes packing to leave hopes so anyhow
for an instant we see the undefended girl underneath so ok thats all
then again she changes manner remembering a practical problem approaching it as a matter of fact hooker
well could i have them back now hon
those tape recordings youve got downstairs ok
and if you want you can have a good time and ill have a good time and what about everything since
she draws back again
up to now shes been reasonably on top of things
starting now we see her driven toward the things shed really rather not talk about and increasingly more shaken
prompts everything thats happened since tom grunemann disappeared
the phone calls and the just phone calls right
they ring you answer they dont say anything just blank
kids getting kicks
burglars looking for an empty apartment
i mean there is nothing that proves what about the other things youve reported
consulting notes being followed on the interrupts awkwardly look im sorry ive led everybody wrong
i mean yes i get those feelings but thats just me thats just feelings
beat im sure this will amuse you im scared of the dark
and sometimes i get shook up i hear people or well ill come out in the morning and think someones been prying at my mailbox or theres a little trash
outside my door and i wonder if someone left it there for do you see
things other people wouldnt even notice
well thats not real its just nerves its got nothing to do with the phone rings
then approaches with some difficulty but then answers with complete calm in her smith girl voice
brightly oh yes ted carlin how is ted
listens oh well thank you very much but maybe the next time youre in town
listens well i just love ted and id love to meet you you have a very nice voice but i just listens grows impatient well im having a chat with
a very nice cop
actually not a real cop hes a private inves a buzzing from the phone the connection abruptly broken
she hangs up recites
is that how you get most of your dates
someone gives your name to someone else
most of them
is that how you met the dumper
someone else gave how would i remember
how else do you meet them
a beat patient youre very square
pimps dont get you dates cookie they just take the money
klute takes up the slip of paper previously given him by trask
in the same manner as before i have some names the police gave me
will you tell me what trembling look im sure thisll amuse you too
ilia trying to get away from all that
what about the old gentleman the other night mr
she freezes again looking at him
then savagely you saw that goddamn you
you saw it
his wifes dead
he started cutting garments at fourteen
his whole life hes maybe had a weeks vacation im all he has and he never never touches me and what harm in it what she chokes then goes on
klute tell me whats your bag
are you a talker or a button man or a doubler or maybe you like them very young children or get your chest walked around with high heeled shoes or
have us watch you tinkle
or under you want to wear womens clothes or you get off ripping things she grabs up the company picture raging on you perverted hypocrite square bastards
something in his inflection very slight cautions her
she falls silent as suddenly as she began
then cheerfully gee i hope this doesnt make my cold any worse
tell me about frank ligourin
casual pleasant mm
oh he was my old man
we broke up
she wanders away toward a bureau
her shirt seems to itch her she scratches her ribs
then opens drawer takes out a different shirt as when
beat when did you and ligourin break up
she pulls off her shirt unhooks her brassiere and discards it apparently quite unselfconscious
klute reacts then carefully maintaining his cool mind not doing that
she turns to him in total innocence holding the shirt rather carelessly in front of her a new attack
ingenuously i thought you could trick me for those tapes
dont you get lonely in that little green room
or let me get you someone i have terrific friends wild
at this point or about this point klute takes note of something
a little above her
he grows more watchful but containing it carefully
we dont understand the change in his manner or even notice she doesnt
in mock dismay gee
ive had men pay two hundred dollars for me here youre turning down a freebie
pause you can get a perfectly good dishwasher for that
he has risen is approaching her slowly carrying his notes as if to check something
she is hopeful again youve changed your mind
you do want to play
quietly steadily i dont want you to look up
theres someone on the skylight
she gasps terrified immediately almost beyond control
he taps the pencil on his notes
easy pretend youre looking here more insistently here
she manages to take hold of a corner of the notes trembling
he goes on now im going to walk around you just keep talking straight through straight through
he strolls away from her
his destination is the area of the door out of view from the skylight from where he can head for the roof
but he doesnt head that way directly first takes a turn in another direction his bearing casual
prompting tell me about acting what are you doing tomorrow where do you go
manages barely i go on rounds
rounds what are they
dont watch me keep talking
you go see agents or equity calls open casting calls
and ad agencies commercials you dont get work you just go around
klute has strolled out of view from above instantly flattens himself against the wall eases the door open about to slip and charge
as bree labors on and theyre always polite show people they say thank you very much
you lie there covered with blood smiling they say footsteps across the roof above as the watcher discovers klutes ruse
klute opens the door climbs ladder to roof
klute out looking around the figure the man scissoring over the low walls where one brownstone joins another
klute gives chase over ridges past water tanks oddments of roof furniture the figure races to a roof door disappearing into abandoned building
camera follows klute as he cautiously makes his way down the stairwell of the boarded up old brownstone
he gets to the first floor
he can see no exit in the building
he opens door that leads to a narrow staircase into the cellar
it is as black as a dungeon and as low
he lights a match but sees no one
there is a sound of movement coming from the floor above he runs up the steps to the floor above and sees a very faint light coming through one of
the closed apartment doors
carefully takes out a gun and then with one quick movement he breaks through the door
the walls ceiling floors are entirely covered with crudely painted psychedelic signs and sayings
the room is lighted by some candies stuck in bottles
sitting on a blanket on the floor are several teenaged boys and girls having a pot party
they have obviously made a clubhouse for themselves in the abandoned house
it is a moot point whether they or klute is more stunned at the sight that faces them
he puts his gun away in embarrassment
again he has been made to feel like an awkward peeping tom in this hidden world of the city
camera wanders restlessly through the blackness and stops at a pinpoint of light coming through a low door
camera goes through opening into long narrow furnace room with the ceiling so low that an ordinary man could not stand up
we hear the sound of breathing
camera follows the sound through the darkness revealing a sweaty man huddled in the corner looking like some strange animal from a painting by bosch
it is cable
bree has wrapped herself in the quilt standing up against a corner shivering immobilized
we hear klutes footsteps descending she flinches he enters
i couldnt get him
he sees her condition
gently its all right
he reaches to touch her she quails away from him
well do you think it was him
what do you think
cant you get him
maybe if you tell me the things you havent
pause you asked me where i got that date with the dumper frank sent me on it
do you know where he got the dumper
he never told me
well lets go down and ask him
a shot catching the edge of central park itself our first small view of greenery to the tall be limousined apartment buildings of c
the figures of klute bree walking upstreet turning under one of the canopies klute carries a zipper book case
the doorman hangs up the brass house phone smiles and gestures them graciously into the self service elevator
we see klute without making too much of it taking in the mirrors and marble work
she breaks the silence
what did you expect
frankie still has a good string three girls
figure three hundred a week from each
is that what you gave him
the buzzer sounding frank ligourin crossing to open the door for bree klute
cheerful hospitable nice unpretentious
bree hi come in come in
the point of this one brief shot brees face in the instant after frank has spoken and before she enters with klute following
her half second of hesitation
this is someone who gets to her somehow probably always will
the apartment is as expected but not overdone a certain small amount of someone lives here litter
a few large but not very good abstractions on the walls
there is a large table covered over with photographs and mock ups of magazine pages a felt board or easel with lettering samples franks props really
shakes hands hi
leads them in indicating table i was just catching up some work mocking up the photographs
to klute i used to be a photographer myself bree tell you
before i got in the publishing
frank he knows youre a pimp
he knows you were my pimp
then with the tact of a gentleman dealing with rude difficult woman well bree maybe youd rather he gestures gently to indicate outside
she nods once
he escorts her in that direction out the door closing it behind them
he escorts her to the elevator pushes the down button for her
in silence so far
then quietly as one who knows the others thoughts hows it been
she shrugs a shoulder at him looks away
he goes on in the same quiet voice
with me bree its eternally the same
i guess you know that
yeah frank i know that
she yanks at the elevator doors
but the elevators not here yet
she turns away sharply into the door marked stairway
he turns back to his apartment
frank reenters with the calm smile of troop chaplain
ive always respected bree
then id like to make something clear
ive just got a few id like to make something clear
i dont go after a girl a girl comes to me
he gestures klute to one chair sits in another waits calmly attentively
im looking for a man
no response whatever bree thinks he may have been the dumper that call she had two years ago
she says you sent her on it
two years ago
they tell me you use narcotics
could i bring someone around to look at your arms
look dad i may stand better with the cops than you
ok a family matter
between the girls
i had two other cows corrects himself two other girls besides bree
she told me
ok and one of them jane mckenna she blows a little jealous of bree you know
bree comes first
and evidently she knew the freak that he was a dumper she conned me into passing him to bree you know so breed get hurt
i didnt know
why didnt you tell bree afterwards
a little shocked you dont tell them
that one of their own in laws laid a dumper on them
shakes head peace in the family
pause beyond that i dont know
all she wrote
id like to talk with jane mckenna
smiles would i be telling you all this
she copped out long ago
she committed suicide baxter
bree sits looks with curiosity at housewives her age bringing their children in from the park as if trying to imagine what their lives could be like
klute emerges from elevator
did you like my friend frankie
didnt he tell you what you wanted
it didnt go anywhere
then but thats not why about the dumper didnt he tell you that
it was jane mckenna who sent you the dumper
coldly well shes dead
at the corner he slows starts unzipping his bookcase as if indicating a change of route
i thought you were going back to the apartment
he shakes his head you said you wanted these
he hands over the tape reels
oh golly oh just what ive always dreamed of dirty phone calls
then how come
you told me what you could
i guess im through with your part of it
grudgingly is there anything more i could i dont see anything do you
whatre you gonna do next
try some other ways
starts off what do i do meanwhile
wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me
and i dont think that was tom
you said it was
no i said what did you think
oh wait oh i get it
you said that just to keep me scared
so id tell you everything i oh clever oh you smart tricky hick
well harshly hey but did we get to you klute
yeah you got to me
us city folks
the sin the glitter the wickedness
not that way
id say it was more i dont know hunts the word too bad
she turns smartly away deposits the tapes in passing in a litter box departs
klute looks after her for a moment then turns on his way
then this shot holds both in view for a moment until they both disappear separately in the traffic
camera moves in slightly on litterbox as a mans hand comes into frame and removes the tapes
klute in pajama bottoms lies in bed
a miserably hot humid night
knock at the door
bree stands in the doorway in bare feet
what the hell do you mean pathetic
she walks in past him sits down on the edge of his bed
its kind of late
it got lonely upstairs
theres someone on the roof
he takes her seriously starts to move
oh dont be a doo doo
not much point to this is there
placidly ezra im lots better than youre used to
tell me the other night watching me with mr
faber wasnt your tongue a little bit hanging out
so youre not too different from him or the chap on the roof or tommy baby he starts for the bed as if to lift her onto her feet
she takes off her robe and swings her legs up and under the sheet
look if you dont use it somebody else just will
and youve done your whole bit with me your entire duty and so now this is my thing
so enjoy mr
faber would say enjoy
under the sheet she unlooses her pajama bottoms kicks them away starts unbuttoning the shirt
bree thanks i dont want to
oh dont be all hypocrite
or do you really like other kicks
is it more just having power over someone
so you dont really need to he tries to rebutton the pajama shirt
she catches his hand thrusts it underneath
in grief and anger who the hell are you buttoning me up
their bodies lock together descending toward camera her hands slide about his shoulders
she is laughing softly affectionately mockingly i knew it i knew it a killer
triumphantly contemptuously orgiastically oh lover oh you thrill me oh its beautiful oh yes yes oh like that like that yes klute gasps deeply entering orgasm
as soon as she hears it judges it she drops her hands from his shoulders stills her own movements lies utterly passive smiling calmly letting him finish for himself
he cant stop cries out cries out again burying his face against her is done
then he slowly raises up shuddering looking down at her
he knows what shes done to him is helpless to do anything back
he rolls slowly out of the embrace of her legs and lies silently looking upward very much as we saw him at start of scene
she waits still smiling for a while
but shes not done with him yet
she rolls to lie with her upper body on his trailing her fingers across his face
affectionately as a good whore whats the matter hon
you were great
well whatre you down about
you mean because you didnt get me there
pause comfortingly you cant expect that
i mean frank yes hed get me there all the time but never with a john
she sits up gropes her pajamas from the floor puts them on
in the same fond tone and im sorry i cant stay and learn your special little games
and i certainly dont want you to feel bad about this losing your virtue all of a sudden because i sort of knew you would
as i said like everyone right
she has the pajamas and robe on pauses near the door besides you can always tell yourself you made me come downstairs
a wide shot
an open casting call in an off broadway theatre
darkness except for the work light onstage
a small group there onstage including the figure of bree
just offstage the figures of director jang and a producer
and the rest of the theatre the audience section dotted with the heads of actors actresses waiting for their turns
brees voice rings out across the gloom
the others stand rigid as statues facing dead front an experimental drama clearly all holding scripts as bree hastens from one to another fiercely imploringly why please why
why lose why look
why hate and give and want and love
why get grieve g loudly cheerfully thank you very much
all break posture start offstage while bree caught in mid stride clowns it a little
gug gug then toward jang a bit succinctly indicating script why
i want to know what
laughs tolerantly no that was very good everybody
do we have all your resumes
from list booth osman zuff anjeris chaka
wider near stage front
bree shrugs steps down off stage with the others
bree finds jangs hand out for her script smiles wanly turns it over continues on out of scene
she finds something someone impeding her way
klute has edged out into the aisle to intercept her
bree comes out turns
you asked if there was anything more you could help me with
ive checked the records of jane mckennas death i cant get anything special
but frank ligourin had another girl you said besides mckenna and you
did she and jane mckenna know each other
frankie kept them in the same apartment it cut his travel time
then maybe arlyn page knew the dumper too
arlyn had a very big habit heroin shes the one who started frank
shes strung out now you wont find her
you could help me find her
you know the people
as she turns away ill pay you a hundred dollars
i can make that in a lunch break
then look hiram youre sure it isnt just me
you decided you liked it after all the other night youll hang around for seconds
she examines him shrugs turns proceeds along the sidewalk klute accompanying in the small hours
the same place seen previously the gathering place
klute bree arriving and entering
klute and bree head toward the rear
her arrival causes a little stir
she exchanges greetings with one or two is watched by others
joanie mike hi to another a negro girl hi pat
giggles hey bree honey who you got
a new daddy
in he cute
bree leads on to where trina sits alone at a rear table anything but a whore in appearance a quietly beautiful immaculately dressed woman of about thirty
trina this is klute
i told you about him
oh yes mr
klute wont you both join me
as they sit and how do you like our fair city
theres so much here dont you think
the museums and the books and the foreign films bree have you seen the godard film
oh youve got to
he does such fun things with imagery
and ive been reading the fall to klute enunciating carefully the fall by ahlbair camoo its the same thing you know the imagery patiently trina honey he just wants to
find arlyn page
trina undergoes a change of demeanor
shes a junkie
prods gently she was with you after she left frank
well shes not now
then quavering i did everything for arlyn
i loved arlyn i took her right into my apartment my own sweet apartment on first
but she wouldnt stay off it the junk and i wept and i pleaded and i held her in my arms and she started taking things my things and selling
them for horse
we couldve had everything together everything and then the bitch sold my mink
we dolly with klute bree as they walk in front of a row of tables
this night spot is totally black except for a series of huge slide projections on the wall in back of the tables
the slides which change every few seconds are elegant representations of the beautiful people living the good life as seen in such magazines as vogue town country harpers bazaar
the customers sitting in the darkness below provide a direct contrast to the pictures in back
the silhouette figures of bree klute stop at a table seating three people two call girls and a pimp
camera moves in
youll never catch up shes grooved out
the pimp looks distrustfully at klute who reassures im not looking for her personally someone she might know about
shrugs to bree try janie dale
it is a very small penthouse
klute bree stand in the small living room waiting for janie dale
there are two very casually dressed prostitutes sitting around the living room
one sits at an upright piano playing of all things strangers in the night
another one sits on a couch talking to a wall street broker who is spending his lunch hour
klute finds himself staring down into a pile of pornography magazines on the coffee table
bree is amused at his discomfort
janie dale the madame who has been on the phone in the back puts the receiver down and crosses to the girl on the couch
janie looks and talks a bit like lauren bacall
to girl on couch its old mr
clean from cleveland
he wants to know when he can fly in and clean up the apartment and see you
i told him i have all the cleaning equipment and that he can come anytime but its up to you
girl on couch rises
you know he wants us to be dominant
tell him that hed better have his ass in here by one oclock on monday afternoon or you wont let him clean the bathroom floor and tell him the price
has gone up twenty bucks old dutcn cleansers not as cheap as it used to be
she shrugs and turns to klute bree
you wanted to know about arlyn honey
i had to let her go dear
arlyn stopped being reliable
explains to klute i deal with a high type client business people you understand
i cant send them someone thats all the time half zonked out
do you know where she went
try momma reese
the girls look cheaper and the customers rather than wall street lawyers and brokers look more like out of town salesmen who stay at local motor inns
momma reese is older than janie dale heavier and with no pretense at chic
she indicates that she has not seen arlyn in some time
try bill azure
if you can find him
this is a hangout where black and white pimps wait to meet their whores after their night of street walking
this streetwalker world is far removed from the world of the call girl or the world of janie dale
camera pans past a group of pimps at the bar taking bet on whose girls have made the most money that night
camera then goes on to reveal klute talking to another pimp azure
azure represents a clear step down from frank ligourin
we catch only part of their dialogue
a couple weeks then shed drift off a couple of weeks you know what i mean
have you heard from her recently
she liked me all right but she had what she liked better you know what i mean
we start fade sound as klute repeats have you heard from her recently
and cut to shed come in and id let her have something
why not shed been a good customer a beautiful person a beautiful beautiful person
again we fade sound a little before picture then outside theatre or bookstore peepshow an th avenue establishment
silent action this or voices under
klute confers with one girl who summons and consults another
they seem to know of arlyn havent seen her recently refer him elsewhere a shabby place in a shabby neighborhood
vasek the landlady shifts barrels at the same time that she barks at klute in heavy accent
the whore yeah
i threw out
do you know where she went from here
live like animals
her and the man
reacts was she living with a man
we see klute persisting dissolve we still hold wide to establish the scene
this is a genuine slum
we see bree klute move along street
we see bree drop back a little klute waiting for her to catch up
whats the matter
glances about what the hell do you thinks the matter
then suggests i could wait for you someplace
if arlyn page is living with tom grunemann eagerly then you dont need me
but if its someone else i do
he starts on simply assuming that shell follow
there is a degree of acquaintanceship in their manners now a reluctant collaboration
you sure pull a lot of mileage out of a hundred dollars
and follows on
he checks numbers then crosses street diagonally toward a half framed house
a downshot from second floor level toward the entry way where klute bree appear
klute strikes a match to inspect the names of tenants
he and bree climb through stench and litter to the second floor a door
from somewhere near at hand come the sounds of someone retching
a square of wood has been sawed out of the door itself removing handle and lock light sifts through
klute hesitates decides against knocking pushes in
the retching sounds are coming from the connecting room
no one visible here
a very few barren pieces of furniture
we hear arlyns voice ask from the next room cappy
arlyn enters rather eagerly
she sees klute first then bree recognizes her retires flat against a wall holding one palm outwards to shield her face
she is unbelievably gaunt
inside one elbow looking rather like a birthmark we see a lacework of purple where her veins have pulped together
then look its all right
from the connecting room a mans voice bergers calling out hoarsely
is it cappy
arlyn its all right
berger hastens stumbles into the doorframe carrying a car radio with wires dangling speaks before he sees them
cappy i got a radio
he stops for an instant face to face with klute
then turns plunges out of view again
arlyn breaks after
no we hear the mumble and whisper of their voices from the connecting room as she reassures him
bree looks inquiringly at klute is that grunemann
he shakes his head
pause then arlyn reenters wrapping her fingers together timidly wanting them out her only purpose
bree honey please were waiting for someone
arlyn he just wanted to ask some questions something you could help us about
cant you see im strung out
cries out please were waiting for it hes got to have it
just something you could tell us first
arlyn seems to accept the bargain
he indicates to bree to proceed stands away a little
arlyn covers her elbow with one hand
bree manages as best she can
honey a couple of years ago with jane and frankie
jane sent me a dumper please if he sees you he wont come
arlyn just tell me did jane have a dumper one of her regular johns
what about him
did he come around often
klute hands grunemanns picture to bree bree shows it to arlyn
arlyn inspects it then uncertainly weakly no
he was an older man hon
the dumper was older
do you remember his name
what can you tell me about him
we hear footsteps under dimly mounting the stairs
bree notices them first klute persisting with arlyn shouts desperately arlyn get them out
please i am begging you
thats not the dumper thats all
he was an older man
can you give me any more description than that
arlyn catches the footsteps dodges past him toward the door intending to reassure cappy
as the pusher cappy steps in
all of this is very quick simultaneous a confusion of voices
cappy takes one look at klute its all right theyre all right turns and runs
cappys footsteps race away down the stairs
berger plunges out from the connecting room still carrying the car radio shouting pursuing cappy its all right
i got a radio dont run dont we hear him stumble and fall on the stairs outside the sound of body reeling down
arlyn shrieks and races after klute and bree follow
we see berger lying at the foot of the stairs
as arlyn clatters down toward him berger sways up onto his knees
his nose is bloodied he cries
arlyn casts herself on her knees beside him pulls his face against her croons to him soothes and tends him
oh baby no its all right oh my baby baby baby klute and bree are only a half step behind
klute offers to assist arlyn puts him away ferociously
to berger again dont cry my baby ill find him ill get it
baby baby dont cry
to klute savagely incoherently leave us alone
get out and get out and leave us alone
to berger my honey my baby my baby we dissolve to camera moves in closer so we only see reflection of bree looking at herself and at the world seeming
to speed by at an inhuman pace as the lights of the tunnel zoom past her face
what she sees is the figure of a woman with life screaming past her out of control
subway slows to a stop and a door opens
bree sits with klute staring at the open door and then without warning gets up and runs off the train
the door closes leaving klute locked in the train
shot of brees feet rushing up the stairs in darkness and then quick cut to her face as she hits the sunlight
she pauses for a moment relieved to be out of the darkness
camera pans from night view of new york city to klute sitting on the rooftop alone as if trying to comprehend all he has seen the mystery of tom grunemanns
disappearance in this world and the mysteries of the behavior of bree
alongside of him the skylight of brees apartment lights up
he looks through the skylight and sees bree enter her apartment
he can hear bree talking to somebody and then he sees that she is talking to frank ligourin
klute watches through the skylight and hears bits and pieces of the scene between bree and frank
he sees the same kind of symbiosis the same kind of parody of loving that he saw between arlyn berger
as the scene becomes more intimate he leaves
the pristine antiseptic elegance off cables office is in its own way as unreal and dehumanized as the sexual underworld klute has been exploring with bree and klute looks as
out of place in the one as he does in the other
trask sits beside klute facing cable who is impeccably dressed
he is the total image of the executive in control
she wouldnt be reliable anyhow a narcotics addict
i believed her pete
hes right you know
waiting for the pusher shed tell you anything
i believed her the dumper was not tom grunemann
all right suppose it wasnt tom grunemann where does that get you
smiles ruefully its where it doesnt get me
ive got nothing left that connects to anything
then close the case
i better keep looking
the best he can offer i could try arlyn page again
she saw much more of the dumper than bree daniel
you just finished telling me she had nothing to offer
not tom you said the dumper was clearly not tom
its got to make sense some way
cables secretary appears for a moment tapping her watch significantly
cable they are meeting in mr
yes evvie thanks
gentlemen im sorry
they rise dismissed
he sorts a paper or two continues to klute
im flying back out to pennsylvania friday ill fill them in on things
how is it back there
i think youre homesick
reflects ill be out at my camp over the weekend
nice right now that touch of fall in the air that skim of frost in the early mornings very peaceful
briskly again john ill be back here again thursday ill be in touch
lieutenant thank you
klute and trask depart
cable closes the door and returns to his desk
he pulls out a tape recorder from a drawer in his desk rewinds it and turns it on
we hear a playback of the previous scene with klute and trask
he stands at the window listening with some satisfaction as if listening to what klute revealed keeps him in control of the situation
the camera pulls back from a cu of cable standing at the window to a wide angle looking at cable through the window
the window is or stories high
the wide angle lens almost makes the building look like it is standing on point and cable a man suspended in space
a tugboat has pulled in
the sound of its heavy engines idling runs underneath this entire sequence
a police vehicle or two has parked at the head of the dock
we see several figures on the rear deck of the tug but its not clear at this distance what theyre doing
the police car with klute arrives
he dismounts and proceeds from dock to tug deck
trask glances toward klute as he arrives but doesnt greet him
his attention like the others is directed downward and off scene to the surface of the water actually just outboard of the tug
we see beside trask two uniformed cops sugarman and spence and deckhands
and we hear along with the throbbing of the engines a stirring about of the water and a peculiar third noise rather commingled with the engines which we cant at
klute joins the group watches
spence brings into view and shakes out a giant neoprene body bag
instructions among the group ad toward klute they were bringing a freighter down through kill van kull propellers washed it up on top
sugarman brings into view a metal basket attached with short ropes
he complains why didnt you bring it up on deck
would you bring it up on deck
they slip the basket downward out of frame into the water
to other mickey get something
get the eels off
calmly theyll drop off theirselves when she comes out
we cut to we see berger sitting huddled against the tugboat cabin we havent seen him before with his hands bunched in front of his mouth
we identify the noise which may have puzzled us before his we catch a fleeting glimpse of the body being lifted just before it breaks the surface of the water
klute looks on as effects trace the processing of the body
spence kneels down out of frame to slide the bag around it
trask kneels down to make a brief examination straightens again
to klute itll go to the examiner
but i dont see nothin that means nothin
we move with klute as he turns and moves away a few feet along deck
here he stands
then sugarman moves into view holding a clipboard
routinely you help us with id
we cant get nothin from him
he indicates the direction of berger
klute examines the clipboard data
arlyn page was probably an alias
she went by the names terry arlyn and june price
she may have been from pittsburgh someone told me
i can give you a list of people who knew her if that would help to no point thanks
is he claiming the body
uh uh thatd mean funeral expenses
he spits moves back in the direction of the group klute continues to stand
berger moves in his direction
brokenly man could you help me
klute doesnt understand his purport reacts instantly sympathetically yeah what
you know help me out
thats my baby there dead
i got to get up
klute stares at him a quiet horror as berger insists man you dont know what that does to me my baby dead youve got to get up
klute shoves a bill in his hand turns away very sharply off the tugboat
klute walks a longer distance this time sits down on one of the pilings of the dock
watching him we see what might be a profound awe and grief at all these things but is in fact a good deal more
as police vehicles are loaded driven away and as tug toots runs up engines puts out again
trask moves into scene sits on another piling looks at him speculatively
then thats how the other one died you know
in the water
nods i looked it up
then we are assuming a complete understanding here between klute and trask non verbal
what trask is asking in effect is is this meaningful
do we both suspect the same man
it is late afternoon but bree is in her pajamas curled up in her bed
there are some magazines scattered around the bed and the television set is on an old movie
there are cracker crumbs in the bed and a cup of coffee and an open jar of peanut butter with the knife sticking out of the jar on the floor
by the bed
it would seem that bree has spent most of the day in bed
she looks like an unkempt child
the phone is ringing but she does not answer it
the phone no sooner stops than the door bell rings
reluctantly she gets out of bed and goes to the door
she looks through the spy hole and sees klutes face
she undoes two locks and an obviously new chain and bolt and opens the door
well hello come on in
he barely enters the room
his manner is cool and remote
i thought you ought to know arlyn page is dead
the same as jane mckenna
she betrays no reaction thanks for the jolly news
i thought maybe youd left town by now
you kind of just disappeared
but you boys from tuscarora have a habit of disappearing dont you
klute looks around the disorderly room
the plants in the windowsill have never been in worse shape
they look as if she deliberately let them die of thirst
the next few weeks i would like to know where you are all the time
just let me know when you are going out and where what if i go out on tricks you wanna come along
you could sit and read the national geographic
how can you do it to yourself
coolly i dont get you
ligourin how could you do it
i told you before you wouldnt understand
youre right i dont understand
explain it to me
pause you were scared
arlyn page that scared you
well it should thats death
so what did you do you ran straight for it death
ligourin kills women
no no youre right im sorry
he uses women he lets them kill themselves
is that how you want it
arlyn was a junkie im not on junk
no you can find some other way
beat explain it to me
bree show me any sense to screams incoherently you get the christ out
you dumb stupid bastard you dont know anything you square you get out
i dont have to show you anything you get out
the empty apartment
he enters switches a light on dusk tosses aside jacket bookcase etc
then sits down on the edge of his bed with one foot propped up on it
footsteps and a rap at the door
he looks up but doesnt move doesnt answer
bree opens it enters
there are tear tracks down her face but shes no longer crying
she tries to smile tries to explain her wants
then with the unhurried graven composure of absolute desperation she sits on the edge of the bed
if i asked you something would you not laugh
asked you to look at something
she pushes up her sleeve points at tiny spot on her arm a freckle
he peers at it then at her puzzledly
apologetic i thought it was maybe changing shape or something
klute looks at it again
judiciously he shows her a spot or two on his own forearm
she compares is reassured
embarrassedly she tries to smile
it is unsuccessful
she gets up and moves about
her manner in general is totally unguarded honest undramatic searching
look i hate everybody and im sorry for everybody and im scared all the time
he only grunts
a sound like ok or all right an invitation to leave
but she wont be driven away
more urgently helplessly look i dont know either
its like the only thing i know how to do i feel safe
shes left the door a little ajar
he widens it for her
its been a full day
she pushes it out of his hand pushes it shut
a little more angrily please
we did this before
then well all right
but you want to and i want you to and we both know it and all right
evenly slowly i dont like getting splashed
she accepts it decently
tries to smile again nods
she gestures tries to find something more to say moves by degrees toward the door and would succeed in leaving
but then bree standing still she starts again to cry and bravely to keep the crying to herself
the child bereft
he contends with himself then crosses to her puts his arms around her soothes her hair
a completely asexual gesture at this point a giving of comfort
she clings trembles burrows
then a series of dissolves the street outside at different times of night interposed with bree and klute at different times of love as follows the street as we saw
it just previously
still somewhat populated but drawing toward dusk
darkness now or close to dark the room heavily shadowed
bree and klute sit together on the bed
he still strokes her hair
he has pulled a blanket around her shoulders
the transaction is still not overtly sexual but the tenderness is more overt
he rubs his cheek against her forehead
she herself is quieter comforted
she begins to stir against him
the street at night
eleven oclock lets say
some lit windows a single car moving past
all the windows dark this time
the deepest night just before the sky begins to lighten
klute is alseep more or less on his stomach
bree beside him lies awake
she trails her fingers about his back
a rather tentative exploratory business
her expression is more wondering than anything else what does she have here and can she get used to it
the streets first stirrings
from not far off the sounds of trash cans being collected
klute half sits up in bed
bree is fast asleep with her head pillowed on his midsection
some humor in this shot he wants to move but doesnt want to wake her
at a point he risks it reaches out for something beside the bed
her eyes open immediately
he puts his hand on her face trying gently to press her back
go back to sleep
but she takes his hand and retains it rolls onto her back
still relaxed but a little more separate thoughtful a mixture of the bree weve seen before and the bree weve glimpsed the possible bree
she observes im still scared
beat i mean different but still
frowns look i made it very clear from the start youre a yokel you dont excite me you dont even interest me and so i only have one question which
is what the hell are you doing in my bed
she grins then starts to reach for him still receptive then feels another and genuine pang turns her head away sharply
he looks at her with concern but only caresses her
she manages to explain i am scared
the things i do
the things i could do to you
no not just mm
you dont know what i he settles himself beside her makes overtures
she responds but oh boy say you think youre pretty good
she pretends to bite they tussle she feels a suddenly growing excitement seizes him
fiercely welcomingly full out
oh and we cut directly to bree standing angry antagonistic demanding
in a way a bree like way shes seized psychiatry by the throat
the son of a bitch seduced me
spangler says nothing
i know its ridiculous
but its tearing me up and i dont know why
and look all right i came here didnt i
and if i have to ill keep coming here the works and talk about my mummy and my daddy and ill even pay for it but will you kindly for
gods sakes say something
smiles id just be guessing
maybe this wasnt just a trick
maybe youre in danger of real love real involve primly distintly i do not love him
undeterred suggests youve spent your life avoiding this
youll try hard to deny it youre quite likely to destroy it
sunlight is beaming on the graceful fountains and elegant architecture
groups of cheerful tourists are admiring the civilized monuments to mans search for culture
camera pans to ugly street across the way revealing klute approaching and entering a dingy warehouse topped by an absurdly placed copy of the statue of liberty
this is the municipal storehouse
the abrupt cut from the bright sunlight leaves us in almost total darkness as we follow klute
we are in a huge storeroom
as we grow accustomed to the darkness we see bits and pieces of incongruous objects scattered along klutes path old pieces of furniture lamps piggy banks etc
the remnants of the lives of the plundered the destroyed and the dispossessed
some is stolen property some evidence for homicide cases and some the unclaimed possessions of the unclaimed dead
a custodian an ancient retainer sort a civil servant leads klute into an old elevator cage
klute and custodian as elevator ascends looking up the elevator shaft through the open cage we see a series of doors hanging over space seeming to lead nowhere
the whole sequence has the feeling of a dream of being lost in a black limbo
klute and custodian leave elevator on higher floor and walk down the long very low corridor past rows of locked vault doors
the custodian stops at one and opens it
we are in a small dungeon like room filled with banks of files from floor to ceiling
the custodian counts to himself four five what numberd i say
four ninety seven jane mckenna custodian finds it unlocks for klutes inspection
reaches for paper klutes holding
and i keep the authorization please
i thought thered be more
klute pokes through a small collection of personal effects perhaps an ankle bracelet rabbits foot faded snapshot of a child some letters pitiful remnants of jane mckennas life
klute closes the drawer and the front of the drawer is marked mckenna jane
over the visual material of klutes trip through the warehouse we hear wild track voice over bits and pieces of bree talking with the psychiatrist
space well separated
from other people
space well as if i can be here i can go through the motions right
but the truth is i dont belong
prompts mildly dont belong
snappishly do you always have to repeat
then well its more than loneliness
people hating me and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me you know
im all screwed up
you think people hate you
the truth is i hate them they must hate me
all right the money
pause all right not the money
a kind of put on
it gets things back together
pause well lets say id go to one of these cattle calls a tryout
i mean before before i got this job and theyd always say thank you very much and id feel you know brought down
they didnt want me
didnt want you
snaps i said that
resumes well so you have a choice
you can either feel lonely you know the hate or then more rapidly plunging so you take a call and go to a hotel room and theres some john youve
never seen before but he wants you
he must hes paying for it
beat and usually theyre nervous and thats all right too because youre not you know this thing
and then for a while boy they really pay attention youre all there is
beat and its not real and you dont have to even like them you can even hate them its all right it safe you know
on the left a portion of the original obscene letter
on the right a series of comparison documents beginning with a portion of a personal letter
we hear trasks klutes voices over and occasionally cut to them as skipping summarizing all right theres tom grunemann youre right different margins different spacing absolutely sloppy right
all right try this next guy
the right hand document is switched
think this is our guy
i dont know
it looks familiar to me
thought it might
its off an arrest report you typed two years ago
man you wanted samples of everybody
then with subdued satisfaction switching the projector again
now the next cat
same margins top and sides
he does best with his middle fingers you get fainter registration from outside keys like q a l p and like that
next thing look around apostrophes how he hits the space bar before but what reason could he have
what possible reason
unless he was involved with grunemanns disappearance
i knew tom never wrote that letter
what else do you know
i never could believe that tom was a split personality
i never believed he was a dumper and i dont believe he disappeared of his own volition and i dont believe hes alive
we have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior but theres no evidence of murder theres not even a body
i dont believe toms alive
as klute talks he paces back and forth in the darkness
he crosses in front of the lighted screen the letters projected on the screen ripple over his face
klute and trask are seen entering from the projection room
in the background we see an old black woman sitting in front of the picture file of unidentified dead carefully studying each picture
in the foreground klute sits down at a phone and dials
cables office please
camera goes in close on klute
through telephone john how are you
ill be sending you on a report tonight
its a beautiful day in tuscarora i dont envy you that humidity in the city
its not so bad
there is a silence
both klute and cable seem to be waiting for one or the other to make the next move
would you like to know whats in it
obligingly whats in it
i think tom grunemanns dead
ive been a lot of places ive asked a lot of people
ive found no proof hes around
ive found no proof he was ever around
how do you go from that to the idea toms dead
suicide youre suggesting
he killed himself
plodding unemphatic he couldve been murdered
im sure the fbi and the police explored that possibility
they never did really
but thats what im going to recommend
the next step
unless something have you discussed this with them
its in the report
do they have the report
have you discussed it with them
i wanted to give it to you first
all right then john just sit tight will you
ill read your report ill discuss it with the others
ill be back next thursday well talk the whole thing over then
nothing til thursday all right
klute hangs up
he was always at their house on holidays
tom and holly always had him over on holidays
tom felt sorry for him his whole life was work
tom felt sorry for him
the old black lady motions to trask who crosses to her
she points to a picture in the file
she has obviously found her missing person among the photographs of the unidentified dead
she starts to stand but then sits again obviously shaken
klute crosses to her and gently helps her out of the chair
he sees in her face the same sense of loss he feels for his friend
bree examining and feeling fruit in some imitation of a very shrewd and experienced housewife shopper
she is obviously enjoying her sense of domesticity and klute is amused by her enjoyment
the nursery is an absurdly cheerful spot of greenery in the midst of the dirty chaos of the avenue
klute and bree wander through the plants
i saw mr
beat you remember mr
faber dont you
is that all you have to say
what am i supposed to say
well i told him i wouldnt uh go there any more
pause i know its tough to understand but it wasnt easy
you see he was nice to me
i mean it wasnt just him
i got something out of it too i guess
anyway i told him i wouldnt go there anymore
she is like a child awaiting praise from her teacher
klute says nothing
they continue walking among the plants and he picks up a few that she had admired
well heres your gold star
considering his contempt for all the dead plant life he has seen in her apartment in the past she is pleased by this act of belief in her
spangler says we have a relationship
you and i a relationship
i was wondering what that was
beat hell theres nothing so mysterious about the square life
bree klute approach unhurriedly along the sidewalk
she is holding his arm hums to herself enjoys the evening
we follow them up
the apartment is a shambles furniture overturned decorations ripped from the wall bedding scattered and ripped
klute jettisons the grocery bags thrusts himself inside looks quickly about finds no one
bree follows more slowly whispering oh jesus
dont touch anything
he moves quickly to the rear of the apartment looks at the rear window which has been broken inward in a litter of glass then returns to the table at
the front of the apartment his folders
bree cracks wise unsteadily
you suppose hes a married fella
the contents of the folders have been spilled across the table and we zoom in the photographs of tom grunemann sorted out and ripped apart even the company picnic photograph
has been painstakingly torn specifically to destroy the image of grunemann in the front row
he stands looking down taking no notice as he got in my clothing
then a moment later she cries out again more sharply oh
he turns quickly
she is holding out at arms length a pair of her underpants
with a disgust so extreme she can only laugh
oh look what he did in them
she doesnt respond
he seizes her arm shakes the garment back onto the floor
she starts to gag slaps her hand over her mouth starts for the bathroom
klute yanks her back
stay out of there
she twists free of his hands backs away
the same elementary terror weve seen before
listen to me its all right
ive been expecting something
full out vengefully my god i thought it was over
and here i am daddy right back at the start
bree right back at the start right
go down in my room
you said it was over right
you said not to worry any more all over right
shes broken for the door its questionable that shes even heard him
he hasnt time to pursue shouts again go down in my room and wait
then he turns back into the apartment
a downshot to underpants as if from klutes pov connecting directly to the previous shot then a flashbulb goes off and a hand and pair of tongs enter frame and
flip the garment into a collecting box and we widen to reveal that its now daylight and the scene has been invaded by police technicians
one is a photographer another a fingerprint man is spraying surfaces with a can of fixative
in the foreground klute and trask are talking with ross the fbi man
ross is looking through a dossier on cable that klute has compiled
over the following conversation we show closeups of material in the dossier
it contains photographs of cable and his life from childhood to the present including pictures of him with his mother and father she a very dominant looking lady and he
a very passive looking man also graduation pictures and pictures with his former wife taken when he was still a very young man
they are the personal images of a life time
to klute but if cable killed grunemann why would he get you hired to look for grunemann
because he knew i couldnt leave the case alone
and this way at least hed keep track of it
what about grunemanns letters to the girl everything like that
cables letters cables phone calls
cables everything else
hes been a dumper a long time
he just passed off his own peculiar habits on the other man it kept things goin
ok pretend i believe you
tell me how you get an indictment
oh we got everythin else first rate evidence cable typed those dumper letters to bree daniel
and jane mckenna klute found a couple in her personal remains
we got dates of cables trips here coincidin with phone calls to bree daniel also the dates of death of mckenna and page
we got some hints of his personal history
his father unsuccessful salesman committed suicide when he was
his mother pinned all her hopes on her son
he won a national science youth award at the age of eight
they had no money but she hired special tutors for him in the summer time
she saw a good thing
he graduated from high school at college at no friends the kids in his class thought of him as a freak
he got his ph
at married at age to his then employers daughter
the marriage lasted weeks
her father had it annulled
she says he was impotent
world war ii he got in bad trouble about a german girl no details
we think we know why he killed grunemann he found out cable was a dumper cable couldnt take that
we think we know why he killed mckenna she wanted to blackmail him for it
but we got no body no direct witnesses we cant go any damn where
thats the reason i told him we had no evidence tom was still alive
we wanted to shake him into another phone call or another letter
it didnt work out just that way
the technicians meanwhile have packed to depart
the first technician scoops the torn up photographs into another collecting box
trask retrieves the company outing photograph
gov want to leave me that one
how come he got to play with this one anyway
i left them here
i was doing some work here
trask eyes klute for a moment as if a querying his relationship with bree
klute is clearly unresponsive
its damn lucky you didnt have the dossier on cable here
nobodys seen that
if we get anything from the lab well have it by noon
and just think all he really had to do was write us a letter
sounds to me you better shake him again
put him in a spot he has to do something more but this time give him a time and a place to do it
he called this morning from tuscarora
asked me to meet him at at the downtown heliport
hes on his way to chicago
he sure chalks up a lot of flight time
klute starts gathering his papers we cut to bree coming up the stairs meets the technicians coming down stands aside to let them pass starts up again and comes face
to face with klute
on her part we see a wish to be reconciled a shyness mixed with defiance but klutes manner is arduous
she smiles nervously asks ah schmendrick whats the scam
those were police laboratory people theyve been over the apartment
mock delight oh zippidy doo theyll find my fingerprints
then can i go in
i need some stuff
he nods she starts by
then whered you spend last night
i called trina
maybe i wasnt there when you called
bree whats actually happened
it wasnt that bad
cuts in harshly how do you know how bad it was
why couldnt you stay here with me
because i didnt want to be touched
i didnt think youd get that
then evenly trask wants to talk with you
she starts on then turns back toward him rather pleadingly hey look officer i can explain everything
it was just you know everything all of a trask wants to talk with you
she continues on up klute continues down
entering without greeting trask his manner is not uncivil but simply neutral unreacting cop like she quickly gathers up a few properties a change of shoes
miss daniel be sensible you find another place till we get things cleaned up
brightly oh well that shouldnt take you more than another oh two and a half or three years should it
a few more days
we know who did this
so do i
no not grunemann
the man that killed him also probly jane mckenna also arlyn page
she spins around mute terrified
manages arlyn and jane commited suicide
he said they commited suicide
now theres a picture id like you to you said someone killed them you said you know who you said that
well were pretty why isnt he locked up
we dont want to just lock him up we want a conviction we wanted him to do something more
is that why klute didnt tell me
i guess he figured it was better
what was better
i made better bait
no thats not is that what he set me up for
everything hes told me from the beginning
dont worry dont coldly from the beginning i dont know why the hell hes messin with you
if he was me hed know better
if he was even a city boy hed know better
youre a whore miss daniel thats the truth of it right
now somethin id like you to look at
i dont have to look at anything
i dont have here please
he coerces her to the table and unrolls the company outing picture
we see the rip extending up through the image of tom grunemann in the front row
like for you to look for the man
ive looked at him a trask has clamped his thumb over the torn image of grunemann indicates with the other hand no
just look around i said look for the dumper
we see her comply her eyes moving over the rows of faces
then we see her stiffen hear her gasp oh
and we cut to cable welcomes klute
his outer manner is warm voluble congratulatory sorry we had to meet here
but im pressed for time
well theres a couple i read your report
i had to go along with it the idea of this being a wild goose chase tom being nowhere around well as a matter of ive been up country you
know my summer place my camp
i dont even have a telephone there
this morning they sent a messenger out that youd been trying to call me
im on my way to chicago
very important meeting tonight
well any new developments
yeah two things pete that you said trask was arranging laboratory work
anything from that
it wasnt tom
i dont understand
it wasnt tom that broke in the room
it has to be tom
you said he ripped up his own pictures he not tom
whoever it was left a kind of souvenir i told you in her clothing
the laboratory got a blood group reading from that
the man was blood type tom was an ab
slowly some mistake perhaps that no
no mistake pete
it doesnt prove who it was but proves it wasnt tom
you must be discouraged
prosaically not too bad
this brings back that dumper in the picture
dumper the man bree daniel mentioned and arlyn page knew and jane mckenna knew
you said he was no possible connection with tom
the page girl told you that not tom
someones been doing all these things
you were hired to look for tom not someone
pete ive got a chance to buy jane mckennas black book
call girls generally keep a book you know a list of their clients
sometimes if a girl retires shell even sell it worth good money
jane mckenna had a black book when she died it was stolen
ive been after it a long time
you were hired to look for tom
im meeting a man tomorrow night
he wants to meet me on east river drive he wants five hundred dollars for the book
can you get that for me pete
sometime right along about now it privately comes to cable that klute may know everything and that he cable may be being trapped
i cant follow you
will the company put up five hundred dollars to get jane mckennas list of clients
this has nothing to do with tom grunemann
shrugs stolidly it probably has the dumpers name
it might give us some kind of new lead
beat i want a look at it anyhow
klute the companys interest is tom grunemann
solely and exclusively
you say you cant find tom all right ill see that youre paid off the case is closed
all right but im going to see that list
helicopter flight is announced over loud speaker and cable and klute walk onto field
people are boarding helicopter
why would they deal with you
you dont know these people
klute is momentarily at a loss not a question hed prepared for improvises
no but bree does
shes negotiating for me
cable takes an instant to compute the thing
then i can talk it over possibly i can get the money
when are you meeting the man
tomorrow evening nine
east river drive and rd street
suppose i meet you there a half hour before
just send me a money order
no id like to be in on it
attendant comes over to motion cable onto the helicopter
klute smiles awkwardly raises his hand in a goodbye gesture
see you tomorrow night
cable sits down next to window
the helicopter begins to rise
camera goes into a medium close shot of cable against the helicopter window
the helicopter ascends in front of a very tall office building made up of endless glass squares
a telephoto lens brings the glass squares of the building directly against cables head and shoulders giving us the feeling that cable is almost levitating by himself
as one floor after another disappears behind him we see an almost manic exhultation in cables face as if he is on top of things once more
we bring klute along street and into the brownstone
klute climbs the stairs to brees apartment knocks
he calls once bree
he starts downstairs again then turns back unlocks the door himself enters
the room is still disordered
bree and frank ligourin look at him silently
bree has been assembling armfuls of dresses to carry away with her
frank sits nearby in a chair
klute smiles a little almost apologetically
im always getting surprises
bree doesnt answer
she sets the armload of dresses over the back of a chair moves aside to get others
frank smiles cautiously ruefully
then i dont want you to do this
he still doesnt extract an answer
she returns with other dresses
i said i dont want you to do this
tight small trask said i should move
lets not make a thing of it
he continues to look at her she continues to gather possessions
then trying to smile to deal with it casually look too much is going on here
im moving in with another girl thats all
just for a while
helpfully thats right
this other girls got a very big apartment big plenty of room
then look its not necessarily how it looks right
its he thinks better of continuing
klute looks from him back to bree
he speaks gravely spacing his words unable to speak any faster
not with this son of a bitch
frank rises both nervous and offended but dealing with klute as between civilized men
klute lets handle it like grownups
i mean were all grown up now right
ventures forward we all respect each other you know what i mean
i respect you bree respects you you could say it just didnt work out between you and she
but you got to respect her too you know her best interests best for her klute hits him pursues recovers and starts to beat him
blood thickly descends the side of franks face as he struggles away
bree is screaming
bree grabs at him from behind
he thrusts her off
but it allows frank to break away through the still open door
frank clatters down a stairs as klute arrives in the doorframe and as bree behind klute screams no
klute is restrained restrains himself
frank has faced around on the stairs still bleeding extravagantly from his torn scalp
earnestly hey im gonna get you dropped
klute starts out after him frank vaults away down the stairs we hear him stumbling and running klute faces sharply around into the apartment
past klute to bree
she is running away from him again to a corner of the apartment fumbling at a sewing basket
he starts in after her
indistinctly please she swings about as he overtakes her holding a pair of scissors simply and transcendently terrified
she strikes at him slashing his forearm
he and she stand in absolute silence
he looks down at the stain of blood spreading through the fabric of his jacket sleeve
then he turns out of the room and down the stairs
klute comes out of door goes down steps to his own apartment
a passerby stops him for directions and doesnt seem to notice the blood on his sleeve
klute goes into his apartment
bree is in the middle of dialing the phone
her hands are shaking she misdials holds down the receiver for a moment then starts again
klute stands in silence for a moment or two then takes rather more note of his forearm
not urgently but practically it behooves him to stop bleeding
he turns toward the bathroom pulling his jacket off with the other hand
bree speaks to the phone trying to make a simple point trying to keep her voice even
until he gets back
beat yes i heard you i understand that
i said im going to come over ill wait until he gets back
she hangs up before the other party can object in detail takes up her purse and goes out not even closing the door behind her
klute has knotted a hand towel around his forearm now uses teeth and fingers to pull the ends tight
then intending to clean up he takes up a washcloth reaches for the faucet bree comes out of door goes down steps hesitates in front of klutes apartment struggling with
the question of whether to knock
camera pulls back to reveal we are watching her through the windshield of a car in the parking lot across the street
camera pulls back further to reveal the back of cables head as he sits in the car watching her
bree starts to knock on klutes door but stops herself and walks down the street
cables head moves out of the shot
we hear the sound of the car door opening and closing
through the windshield we see cable cross in front of the car and start to follow bree down the street
klute finishes mopping up
sound of telephone
he turns back out of the bathroom and answers it
listens then soberly trask i dont get that
bree is about a quarter block away from the brownstone now hurrying
she waves in the direction of a cab misses it continues on
we cut cable stands looking after her hesitates over choice of action decides to follow
we establish the distance between them cable or so feet behind her unnoticed by her maintaining about the same pace not at this point trying to overtake perhaps waiting for
less populated surroundings we cut back to klute continues his phone conversation short spoken
who told you his secretary
listens has someone checked his hotel
he always stays at the then ill look around ill call you back
he hangs up
first he checks out the windows but if we want to be accurate from mid room without directly approaching the windows themselves
then he secures a pistol from his jacket and folds the jacket itself over his arm to conceal it as a matter of public decorum and goes on out
klutes manner over the next few minutes exhibits an absolute untheatrical care and competence
a man cable may in fact be hiding here somewhere to kill him
he sets about checking the likely places first of all the lower hallway then the stairwell itself moving steadily unalarmedly up
at the top he notes but still without main concern that brees door is open
he calls ahead bree he enters puzzles starts checking around quite thoroughly she might be hiding from him
we cut bree moves past construction work through one of those temporary pedestrian passageways
behind her nearer than before we see the figure of cable
klute comes quickly back downstairs back into his room takes up the phone
through the still open door we watch him begin dialing then cut to bree sits isolated on the waiting room couch
she may have been here for fifteen minutes or an hour
she turns the pages of a magazine one handed without even lifting it from the coffee table with an absolute lack of interest a mechanical gesture
we hear footsteps approaching directly toward where we are watching bree sit
daniel bree looks up in a kind of frozen terror as the secretary smiles nicely lovingly down at her
i have to close up now
leave your name and number with his message service mrs
daniel and why dont you just go home and wait until he no
well i have to close up now
look could i use your phone
i almost killed my i almost killed someone
the same tone completely well im certain doctor spangler will want to talk with you excuse me
bree moves to the desk and telephone
but we move with the secretary as she moves into spanglers inner office and switches out the lights establishing time change dusk now and as we hear o
the sound of dialing and brees voice is mr
fabers phone buzzes he picks it up
then glancing about bree
haltingly im i just have to talk to someone
im just a little way across town yes yes dear yes maybe half an hour sure yes
he hangs up
an ancient stirring a kind of triumph
he glances about then tightens his tie
then it comes to him after all he takes note of himself he leans forward against his desk and rubs his forehead with old bony fingers
we cut to klute on phone
trina will you call me if you hear from her
will you check other people she might call
yeah if it wasnt trouble i wouldnt ask vou
he hangs up immediately starts to dial again then pauses to check a list hes laid out by the telephone
while hes doing this his phone rings
then nothing yet trask im going down the list
ive tried spanglers office and spanglers home i just get his message service
ill keep interrupted listens then grimly i may have steered cable that way
i told him bree was dealing for me for jane mckennas book
have you found any he is interrupted again trask wasting no words on his end of things nods once yeah
and depresses the receiver just long enough to clear the connection and starts dialing again we cut to quitting time
as bree enters from street level employees are coming down the stairs pushing past her
she continues up on until at one point one more officious or more communicative than the others informs her lady its closing up there
were closing up quitting time fabers
unsurely i have an appointment with mr
he lets her pass glances after her like the others continues on his way
bree arrives at the head of the stairs as still others press past her on their way down and comes more or less directly up against the thickset receptionist
she is packing her purse preparing to depart looks somewhat challengingly at bree who sees no way to avoid the issue
i have an appointment with mr
turns bawls mr
faber bree goes on nervously in the direction indicated toward nathan stands bending over a bench with back to camera conferring with another man as bree approaches looking to us
as to her exactly like his father
we hear the receptionists voice repeating mr
faber as bree nears him he straightens and turns a much younger man
bree stops short recognizing the error
im sorry mr
calmly my father went home about fifteen minutes ago he wasnt feeling too good
she has already started away
he calls after her evenly can i help you
she looks back quickly smiles nervously it wasnt important
but we hold on him for a moment as she continues out of scene until he turns away to other matters
then bree returns toward receptionist awkwardly did mr
faber leave a message for me or anything
oh i thought that was for tomorrow
the receptionist riffles through a stack of assorted envelopes hands one out to bree and promptly takes her way off
bree starts to open the envelope then and there but others continue to move past her
she seeks a more private place
bree shelters herself out of sight from everyone else though we continue to hear intermittent voices o
and continue to maintain the sense of other presences
we see her open the envelope she finds nothing inside but money bills totaling fifty dollars
we see her looking for a message finding nothing
it comes to her slowly that shes been paid off and avoided
she bites her lips in pain
she pushes back out of hiding back to the reception area again
by now this immediate scene has emptied though we catch sight of a figure or two at scene start moving through the background and continue to hear an occasional noise
or voice o
bree looks about for someone then scouts for a pencil finds one in a desk or bench drawer starts to readdress the envelope to direct it back to mr
then she breaks off from that takes up a phone instead dials waits then bree daniel
has he called in yet
well if he does im at reads phone two seven eight three one hundred and i guess i can wait here five minutes then ill try from somewhere else
impatiently just tell him bree daniel he knows who
she hangs up goes back to readdressing the envelope
footsteps are approaching in her direction
she glances up apologetically
faber i just wanted to leave this for your father and i wondered if youd she pauses cable hastens toward her along a lane of garments
in this brief glimpse a ludicrous and terrifying figure a noise a gesticulation actually the gesture is arms out palms downward intended as a quieting gesture and the hissing noise
is intended as a shushing
bree cries out turns to run someone as we immediately even as shes turning cut to klute speaks quietly but with terrible urgency into the phone dealing evidently with an
ethically skittish message service at the other end
did she leave a number
beat this is a police call dont make me take time to prove it
did she leave a number
what is the number
beat what is the number
cable and bree
they are at some remove from the site of cables first appearance there are other evidences of time lapse
cables manner is that of slightly strained patience a civility an attempt now and then to smile
bree watches his every slight gesture quivers to make a break for it tries throughout to buy time
cant we talk together reasonably just ordinarily
beat i know youre expecting some kind of extravagant behavior but believe me do you believe me
yes all right we can talk yes
all right then an ordinary matter
im a quite well off man i have a position to respect
i would feel personally uncomfortable to be connected with a certain kind of woman im sure you understand
well id like to buy jane mckennas book
he looks at her discerningly
she seems not to have followed his exposition
he tries patiently to clarify it
her black book jane mckennas her list of of persons
i was told youre negotiating for it on behalf of the phone rings an explosive noise
it has been put on night ring to sound all over the loft and the noise is deafening
but the most bizarre element is cables absolute lack of response to it
it rings and rings as he talks and talks in the same expository tone as before without raising his voice
it drowns out most of his words at most we catch only odd phrases of all the following but he seems not to hear it any more than the clamor
of other things torturing his soul
that was what klute told me you were negotiating for him to buy that list
and im in a position to pay a good deal more for it than he can
do you understand
id like you to acquire it on my beat miss daniel do you not understand
beat miss daniel i cant tell whether you understand me
beat still reasonably is this something klute just invented
is this a trap for me miss daniel does klute know about me
he turns and lifts a phone one of the extension phones situated around the loft though up to now hes given no evidence of even hearing the ringing
he just stands holding the phone for a time then lowers it back on the receiver
with a sort of absolute quiet you have no idea what im talking about
yes jane mckennas book i could make a phone call
no youre frightened youre pretending
well klute knows about me then
does everybody know can you tell me
then it doesnt matter what i do any more does it
then he shudders slightly
you people know nothing about pain
we cut to we see klute probably in mls running along street
he tries for a cab misses it halts the next by expedient of cutting bodily in front of it
the driver starts to lean out to object
klute mashes him back inside enters the cab
we cut back mls the two figures cable bree
they are somewhat separated cable has gone to look down from one of the arched windows of the loft while bree remains in place
she is a prisoner we can suppose when we cut closer well see her eyes continually shifting her mind calculating her chances but he hasnt molested her
he bears her no animus at this point
his manner is rather quiet undetermined
he feels some relief that the thing is in effect over and some puzzlement about what to do with either her or himself now
he returns toward her
nearing her again he gestures several times apologetically seeking words
ive got no idea what i shall do
he happens too close she cant avoid shrinking
im not going to hurt you absolutely im not
will you let me go then
he seems not to have heard the request
he sits for a moment
an intellectual interest a curiosity
meanwhile perhaps we see her starting to slip her shoes off in hopes of running
it puzzles me so badly
ive done terrible things but i cant consider myself a terrible man
ive killed three people and id still want to say it was accident do you see
tries again slowly if youll let me go i could tell them what unhearing resumes tom grunemann discovered me we were here on business together he discovered me with jane
then i suppose it was the the contempt i saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later hed use it against me
within the company
i endured that as long as i could do you see
im sorry im just frightened
excuse me miss daniel
i said yes i see
doubtingly oh no i dont think tell me
pause i just want you to tell me
he rises approaches her apparently taken in credulous grateful wondering youre willing to listen
you want me just to keep talking
he hits her
thats what you do isnt it you make a man feel accepted
thats what you all do
your stock in trade a mans weakness
he hits her again
why dont you ask for mercy
my god what mercy has anyone given me
klute has gun out as he carefully makes his way across the roof
man in hotel window across street holding drink watches him with amused curiosity
klute spots entrance to stairway
klute goes downstairs to back entrance of faber loft
he slips inside
he hears the sounds of the beating a stirring of feet and indistinct impact sounds a murmur of voices but all quite muted undramatic
he maneuvers through lanes of garments trying to gain a line of sight
he understands whats going on strains to intervene but cant disclose himself
at a point he drops to hands and knees slides underneath the garment racks drawing closer to cable trying to gain position
we intersperse his progress with further bree cable fragments as for instance youre a person of no value you have no value klute works his way steadily closer under steadily
increasing pressure as the pursuit and beating continue as sounds o
even close at hand the noises are ambiguous the clatter of footsteps grunts a slap of flesh rather than distinct
once or twice we hear cables voice clearly enough to make out words is that contempt
then no im the one who feels contempt
and once or twice a cry from bree
klute tries to gain aim but cable is too close upon her and they are too steadily in motion
klute moves on moves on gains position springs
cable catches the sound whirls screams klute closes with him knocks loose cables pistol contends for it again knocks it loose again
effect under sirens
cable breaks loose backs a step backs another step and then turns and runs unhesitant against one of the windows exploding it outward with him both frame and glass
we see the body tracing its quick path down the dark side of the building
the sound of sirens a little louder
klute turns from looking down moves to where bree kneels on the floor
he hunkers down
in a gentle enough voice but matter of factly withal as if to a child come on
pause come on
note also shoot in msl without dialogue with sirens o
then we cut to klute is packing to leave
we follow him about as he carries clothing from closet and bureau folds it into his suitcase on the table
we hear the familiar footsteps on the stairs
he lets her in keeps on about his business
his expression is sober hers is quite tentative
he doesnt at least expel her
she ventures in sits on the table swings her heels watches him pack
his arm impairs him
at length i got a call from ross this morning
cable owned a plot of woodland hed go there on weekends
they found tom grunemanns body buried there
theyve notified his wife
pause then sharply well it wasnt us city people that did it your fine rosy cheeked country boy
youre going back
she compresses her lips slips down from the table starts smartly out of the room
she returns and sits on the table again waits
but klute doesnt seem about to say anything more goes on packing
well suppose i hadnt come downstairs
would you just have folded up and sneaked away
i was going to come up
i wanted to ask you to marry me
pause you wanted to or you are
you could at least look at me
he complies stands and looks folding a necktie
but now she finds she has to look away
somewhat brokenly look yes
i mean thanks but dont you think we better be realistic
look at me
im pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned and dear god id tear your heart out
i dont think so
he resumes packing continues through the following
how can you not think so
you know the things i can do
unclearly they dont scare me any more
doesnt scare me
i think we could handle it
thereafter he guards his silence staunchly goes on packing as she comes at the thing from various sharp angles
please im a city person
im sure its just as good as here but im a city person thats all i am
pause hell i know what its like
i was in jersey once the frogs go bra a p all night
pause whatim i supposed to do
mend your socks and sing in the church choir
pause choking do you not believe i love you
im honestly honestly just he has almost finished packing returns toward the suitcase with the tin clock and electric fan tries to fit them in as conversation continues
look why should it be yes or no
cant we keep it going and see
i mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see
people do that thats realistic
bitterly you dont believe that either do you
why cant you see my side
can you use these
he sets the fan beside her hands her the loudly ticking clock
she holds it in her lap numbly
hes packed closes various drawers leaving in good order snaps the suitcase shut lifts it stiffly down from the table
she remains sitting
can i carry something for you to the car
he shakes his head will you kiss me
he moves to the door pauses half smiles well she smiles back
we hear the entryway door opening and closing
she slips down off the table
we cut to klute is lets say about seventy feet on his way when she appears at the front door calls after him
he turns around and stops
he walks slowly back to her
he arrives in proximity to her
then the following events in more or less the following order he looks at her inquiringly
she responds by sitting down plunk on the grubby front step of the brownstone
having stood for some time during which she has offered only twitching motions of her hands he sets down the suitcase
having set down the suitcase but derived no answer he reaches out one arm and leans against the building front
she nearly arrives at the level of statement
fretfully indecisively oh heck pause oh heck then as a man not to be dallied with he picks up the suitcase again
she looks at him strickenly but it doesnt precipitate her into speech
he puts it down again
and then then after all goddamit he reaches out grabs her wrist and simply hauls her along suitcase in one hand bree in the other
as she yanks shouts struggles i havent decided yet
beat i havent decided yet
beat i havent decided yet
