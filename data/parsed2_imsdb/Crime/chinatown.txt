written by robert towne full screen photograph grainy but unmistakably a man and woman making love
sound of a man moaning in anguish
the photograph is dropped revealing another more compromising one
then another and another
crying out oh no
curly drops the photos on gittes desk
curly towers over gittes and sweats heavily through his workmans clothes his breathing progressively more labored
a drop plunks on gittes shiny desk top
gittes notes it
a fan whiffs overhead
gittes glances up at it
he looks cool and brisk in a white linen suit despite the heat
never taking his eyes off curly he lights a cigarette using a lighter with a nail on his desk
curly with another anguished sob turns and rams his fist into the wall kicking the wastebasket as he does
he starts to sob again slides along the wall where his fist has left a noticeable dent and its impact has sent the signed photos of several movie stars askew
curly slides on into the blinds and sinks to his knees
he is weeping heavily now and is in such pain that he actually bites into the blinds
gittes doesnt move from his chair
all right enough is enough
you cant eat the venetian blinds curly
i just had em installed on wednesday
curly responds slowly rising to his feet crying
gittes reaches into his desk and pulls out a shot glass quickly selects a cheaper bottle of bourbon from several fifths of more expensive whiskeys
gittes pours a large shot
he shoves the glass across his desk toward curly
down the hatch
curly stares dumbly at it
then picks it up and drains it
he sinks back into the chair opposite gittes begins to cry quietly
drinking relaxing a little shes just no good
what can i tell you kid
when youre right youre right and youre right
aint worth thinking about
gittes leaves the bottle with curly
youre absolutely right i wouldnt give her another thought
pouring himself you know youre okay mr
i know its your job but youre okay
settling back breathing a little easier thanks curly
call me jake
you know something jake
whats that curly
i think ill kill her
noticeably less plush than gittes
a well groomed dark haired woman sits nervously between their two desks fiddling with the veil on her pillbox hat
i was hoping mr
gittes could see to this personally
almost the manner of someone comforting the bereaved if youll allow us to complete our preliminary questioning by then hell be free
there is the sound of another moan coming from gittes office
something made of glass shatters
the woman grows more edgy
gittes and curly stand in front of the desk gittes staring contemptuously at the heavy breathing hulk towering over him
gittes takes a handkerchief and wipes away the plunk of perspiration on his desk
crying they dont kill a guy for that
oh they dont
not for your wife
thats the unwritten law
gittes pounds the photos on the desk shouting ill tell you the unwritten law you dumb son of a bitch you gotta be rich to kill somebody anybody and get
away with it
you think you got that kind of dough you think you got that kind of class
curly shrinks back a little
you bet your ass you dont
you cant even pay me off
this seems to upset curly even more
ill pay the rest next trip
we only caught sixty ton of skipjack around san benedict
we hit a chubasco they dont pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore
easing him out of his office forget it
i only mention it to illustrate a point
hes now walking him past sophie who pointedly averts her gaze
he opens the door where on the pebbled glass can be read j
gittes and associates
discreet investigation i dont want your last dime
he throws an arm around curly and flashes a dazzling smile
continuing what kind of guy do you think i am
call me jake
careful driving home curly
he shuts the door on him and the smile disappears
he shakes his head starting to swear under his breath
mulwray is waiting for you with mr
walsh and mr
gittes nods walks on in
walsh rises when gittes enters
mulwray may i present mr
gittes walks over to her and again flashes a warm sympathetic smile
how do you do mrs
mulwray what seems to be the problem
she holds her breath
the revelation isnt easy for her
my husband i believe is seeing another woman
gittes looks mildly shocked
he turns for confirmation to his two partners
gravely no really
im afraid so
i am sorry
gittes pulls up a chair sitting next to mrs
mulwray between duffy and walsh
duffy cracks his gum
gittes gives him an irritated glance
duffy stops chewing
cant we talk about this alone mr
im afraid not mrs
these men are my operatives and at some point theyre going to assist me
i cant do everything myself
of course not
now what makes you certain he is involved with someone
she seems uncommonly nervous at the question
a wife can tell
mulwray do you love your husband
shocked yes of course
deliberately then go home and forget about it
staring intently at her im sure he loves you too
you know the expression let sleeping dogs lie
youre better off not knowing
with some real anxiety but i have to know
her intensity is genuine
gittes looks to his two partners
all right whats your husbands first name
visibly surprised water and power
mulwray nods almost shyly
gittes is now casually but carefully checking out the detailing of mrs
mulwrays dress her handbag shoes etc
hes the chief engineer
a little eagerly chief engineer
gittes glance tells duffy gittes wants to do the questioning
confidentially this type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook mrs
it takes time
money doesnt matter to me mr
well see what we can do
already shimmering with heat
a drunk blows his nose with his fingers into the fountain at the foot of the steps
gittes impeccably dressed passes the drunk on the way up the stairs
former mayor sam bagby is speaking
behind him is a huge map with overleafs and bold lettering some of the councilmen are reading funny papers and gossip columns while bagby is speaking
gentlemen today you can walk out that door turn right hop on a streetcar and in twenty five minutes end up smack in the pacific ocean
now you can swim in it you can fish in it you can sail in it but you cant drink it you cant water your lawns with it you cant
irrigate an orange grove with it
remember we live next door to the ocean but we also live on the edge of the desert
los angeles is a desert community
beneath this building beneath every street theres a desert
without water the dust will rise up and cover us as though wed never existed
pausing letting the implication sink in sitting next to some grubby farmers bored
he yawns edges away from one of the dirtier farmers
continuing the alto vallejo can save us from that and i respectfully suggest that eight and a half million dollars is a fair price to pay to keep the desert
from our streets and not on top of them
an amalgam of farmers businessmen and city employees have been listening with keen interest
a couple of the farmers applaud
somebody shooshes them
in a whispered conference
acknowledging bagby mayor bagby
lets hear from the departments again
i suppose we better take water and power first
looking up with interest from his racing form
walks to the huge map with overleafs
he is a slender man in his sixties who wears glasses and moves with surprising fluidity
he turns to a smaller younger man and nods
the man turns the overleaf on the map
in case youve forgotten gentlemen over five hundred lives were lost when the van der lip dam gave way core samples have shown that beneath this bedrock is shale similar
to the permeable shale in the van der lip disaster
it couldnt withstand that kind of pressure there
referring to a new overleaf now you propose yet another dirt banked terminus dam with slopes of two and one half to one one hundred twelve feet high and a
twelve thousand acre water surface
well it wont hold
i wont build it
its that simple
i am not making that kind of mistake twice
thank you gentlemen
mulwray leaves the overleaf board and sits down
suddenly there are some whoops and hollers from the rear of the chambers and a redfaced farmer drives in several scrawny bleating sheep
naturally they cause a commotion
shouting to farmer what in the hell do you think youre doing
as the sheep bleat down the aisles toward the council get those goddam things out of here
right back tell me where to take them
you dont have an answer for that so quick do you
bailiffs and sergeants at arms respond to the imprecations of the council and attempt to capture the sheep and the farmers having to restrain one who looks like hes going
to bodily attack mulwray
through above to mulwray you steal the water from the valley ruin the grazing starve my livestock whos paying you to do that mr
mulwray thats what i want to know
its virtually empty
sun blazes off its ugly concrete banks
where the banks are earthen they are parched and choked with weeds
after a moment mulwrays car pulls into view on a flood control road about fifteen feet above the riverbed
mulwray gets out of the car
me looks around
holding a pair of binoculars downstream and just above the flood control road using some dried mustard weeds for cover
he watches while mulwray makes his way down to the center of the riverbed
there mulwray stops tuns slowly appears to be looking at the bottom of the riverbed or at nothing at all
trains the binoculars on him
sun glints off mulwrays glasses
theres the sound of something like champagne corks popping
then a small mexican boy atop a swayback horse rides it into the riverbed and into gittes view
himself stops stands still when he hears the sound
power lines and the sun are overhead the trickle of brackish water at his feet
he moves swiftly downstream in the direction of the sound toward gittes
moves a little further back as mulwray rounds the bend in the river and comes face to face with the mexican boy on the muddy banks
mulwray says something to the boy
the boy doesnt answer at first
mulwray points to the ground
the boy gestures
he kneels down in the mud and stares at it
he seems to be concentrating on it
after a moment he rises thanks the boy and heads swiftly back upstream scrambling up the bank to his car
there he reaches through the window and pulls out a roll of blueprints or something like them
he spreads them on the hood of his car and begins to scribble some notes looking downstream from time to time
the power lines overhead hum
he stops listens to them then rolls up the plans and gets back in the car
he drives off
hurries to get back to his car
he gets in and gets right back out
the steamy leather burns him
he takes a towel from the back seat and carefully places it on the front one
he gets in and takes off
street lights go on
pulls up parks
hurries out of the car across the park lawn and into the shade of some trees and buildings
pulls up moves across the park at a different angle but in the direction mulwray had gone
he makes it through the trees in time to see mulwray scramble adroitly down the side of the cliff to the beach below
be seems in a hurry
gittes moves after him having a little more difficulty negotiating the climb than mulwray did
gittes looks to his right where the bay is a long clear crescent
he looks to his left
theres a promontory of sorts
its apparent mulwray has gone that way
gittes hesitates then moves in that direction but climbs along the promontory in order to be above mulwray
gittes spots mulwray just below him kicking at the sand
mulwray picks up a starfish
brushes the sand off it
looks absently up toward gittes
backs away sits near the outfall yawns
flashing in the dust
sitting suddenly starts
he swears softly
hes in a puddle of water and the seat of his trousers is wet
below him in watching the water trickling down from the outfall near gittes
mulwray stands and stares at the water apparently fascinated
even as gittes watches mulwray watching the volume and velocity seem to increase until it gushes in spurts cascading into the sea whipping it into a foam
theres a slip of paper stuck under the windshield wiper
gittes pulls it off gets in the car and turns on the dash light
it says hon
sam bagby former mayor chairman
gittes grumbles crumples it up and tosses it out the window
he notices other flyers parked on a couple of cars down the street
gittes reaches down and opens his glove compartment
consists of a small mountain of ingersoll pocket watches
the cheap price tags are still on them
gittes pulls out one
he absently winds it checks the time with his own watch
its as he walks to mulwrays car and places it behind the front wheel of mulwrays car
he yawns again and heads back to his own car
arrives whistling opens the door with j
gittes and associates discreet investigation on it
sophie hands him a small pile of messages
he goes through them
hes in the dark room
gittes walks through his office to duffy and walshs
a little red light is on in the corner over a closed door
gittes walks over and knocks on the door
whered he go yesterday
mens room of a richfield gas station on flower and the pig n whistle
jesus christ this guys really got water on the brain
whatd you expect
thats his job
listen we cant string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something
i think i got something
you pick up the watch
its on your desk
say you hear the one about the guy who goes to the north pole with admiral byrd looking for penguins
gittes walks to his office
is the ingersoll watch the crystal broken the hands stopped at
he was there all night
gittes drops it sits down
walsh comes in carrying a series of wet photos stuck with clothes pins onto a small blackboard
continuing eagerly so what you got
walsh shows him the photos
he looks at them
they are a series outside a restaurant showing mulwray with another man whose appearance is striking
in two of the photos a gnarled cane is visible
continuing obviously annoyed this
they got into a terrific argument outside the pig n whistle
i dont know
the traffic was pretty loud
i only heard one thing apple core
gittes tosses down the photos in disgust
jesus christ walsh
thats what you spent your day doing
look you tell me to take pictures i take pictures
let me explain something to you walsh
this business requires a certain finesse
the phone has been ringing
sophie buzzes him
he picks up the phone duffy where are you
duffys voice can be heard excitedly
i got it
i got it
hes found himself some cute little twist in a rowboat in echo park
continuing okay slow down echo park
to walsh jesus water again
duffy is rowing gittes seated in the stern
they pass mulwray and a slender blonde girl in a summer print dress drifting in their rowboat mulwray fondly doting on the girl
to duffy as they pass lets have a big smile pal
he shoots past duffy expertly running off a couple of fast shots
mulwray and the girl seem blissfully unaware of them
turns again and they row past mulwray and the girl gittes again clicking off several fast shots
move along the red tiled roof and down to a lower level of the roof where gittes feet are hooked over the apex of the roof and gittes himself is
stretched face downward on the tiles pointing himself and his camera to a veranda below him where the girl and mulwray are eating
gittes is clicking off more shots when the tiles his feet are hooked over come loose
gittes begins a slow slide down the tile to the edge of the roof and possibly over it to a three story drop
he tries to slow himself down
the loose tile also begins to slide
gittes stops himself at the roofs edge by the storm drain and begins a very precarious turn this time hooking his feet in the drain itself
the loose tile falls and hits the veranda below
he stops as its about to slide over the edge
he carefully lays it in the drain
but a fragment off the cracked edge of the tile falls
mulwray staring at the fragment at his feet
he looks to the girl
hes clearly concerned
he rises looks up to the roof
the roof and the sign topping it betray nothing
he slowly sits back down staring at the tile fragment
in the style of the hearst yellow press there is a heart shaped drawing around one of the photos that gittes had taken
next to it is a smaller column j
gittes hired by suspicious spouse
holds the paper and reads while getting his haircut and his shoes shined
in fact almost all the customers are reading papers
to gittes when you get so much publicity after a while you must get blase about it
a self satisfied smile comes to gittes face
continuing face it
youre practically a movie star
customers can be overheard talking about the drought
interspersed with above someone is saying theyre gonna start rationing water unless it rains
someone else says only for washing your cars
third says youre not going to be able to water your lawn either or take a bath more than once a week
first says if you dont have a lawn or a car do you get an extra bath
gittes has been staring outside the barbershop
a car is stalled
the hood is up
a man watches his radiator boiling over
laughing look at that
end of conversation fools names and fools faces
gittes has heard the word
he straightens up
smiling to other customer whats that pal
indicating paper nothing
you got a hell of a way to make a living
what do you do to make ends meet
mortgage department first national bank
tell me how many people a week do you foreclose on
we dont publish a record in the paper i can tell you that
neither do i
no you have a press agent do it
gittes gets out of the chair
barney a little concerned tries to restrain him holding onto the barber sheet around gittes neck
barney who is this bimbo
he a regular customer
take it easy jake
i make an honest living
people dont come to me unless theyre miserable and i help em out of a bad situation
i dont kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank
jake for christs sake
gittes is trying to take off his sheet
cmon get out of the barber chair
well go outside and talk this over
the customer is shrinking back into the chair
hey cmon jake
you hear about the fella goes to his friend and says whatll i do im tired of screwing my wife
and his friend says whynt you do what the chinese do
gittes allows himself to be tugged back to his chair
i dont know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact it surprised me it was so quick
i make an honest living
course you do jake
an honest living
continuing so anyway he says whynt you do what the chinese do
gittes comes bursting in slapping a newspapers on his thigh
walsh comes out of his office duffy out of the other one
continuing sophie go to the little girls room for a minute
she gets up and leaves
so theres this fella whos tired of screwing his wife
shut up duffy youre always in a hurry and his friend says why not do what the chinese do
so he says what do they do
his friend says the chinese they screw for a while
just listen a second duffy
a stunning young woman appears behind gittes in his doorway
shes shortly joined by a small gray haired man
they listen unseen by gittes
continuing and then they stop and they read a little confucius and they screw some more and they stop and they smoke some opium and then they go back and
screw some more and they stop again and they contemplate the moon or something and it makes it more exciting
so this other guy goes home to screw his wife and after a while he stops and gets up and goes into the other room only he reads life magazine
and he goes back and he screws some more and suddenly says excuse me a second and he gets up and smokes a cigarette and he goes back and by this time his wife is getting sore as hell
so he screws some more and then he gets up to look at the moon and his wife says what the hell do you think youre doing
gittes breaks up youre screwing like a chinaman
gittes hangs onto sophies desk laughing his ass off
the little gray haired man winces
when gittes looks up he sees the young woman apparently in her late twenties
shes so stunning that gittes nearly gasps
do you know me
i think i
i wouldve remembered
have we ever met
thats what i thought
you see im mrs
you know mr
gittes is staggered
he glances down at the newspaper
not that mulwray
yes that mulwray mr
and since you agree with me weve never met you must also agree that i havent hired you to do anything
certainly not spy on my husband
i see you like publicity mr
well youre going to get it
now wait a minute mrs
shes walked past him toward the door
he stop her
continuing theres some misunderstanding here
its not going to do any good to get tough with me
evelyn flashes a cold smile
i dont get tough with anybody mr
my lawyer does
evelyn starts out the door and gittes starts after her
this time hes stopped by the gray haired man who has also come out of his office and up behind him
heres something for you mr
gittes turns to be handed a thick sheaf of papers a summons and complaint
evelyn walks out the door
continuing pleasantly i suppose well be hearing from your attorney
gittes stares down at the papers in his hand
on gittes desk
there are empty coffee cups the summons and complaint and the newspaper gittes had brought with him from the barber shop
the three men are sitting worn and silent
walsh chewing gum is the loudest noise in the room
gittes looks to walsh with obvious irritation
walsh stops chewing
duffy puts out a cigarette in the dregs of one of the coffee cups
to duffy theres seven ashtrays in this room duffy
thats a filthy habit
i said okay jake
if shed come in here saying she was shirley temple youd say okay to that too
she gave us mulwrays real phone number and address
all she needed for that was the phone book
she said not to call her husband might answer
when i find out who that phony bitch was
gittes is staring down at the newspaper
he suddenly grabs the phone begins dialing
a tight little smile breaks out on his face
he buzzes sophie
get me the times
as he waits and how about that snotty broad
the phone to his ear what does she think shes perfect
coming in waving her lawyers and her money at me so goddam smug
shes no better than anybody else in this town
continuing whitey whats new pal
yeah listen where did you get those photographs
yeah blowing a fuse over the el macando love nest
thats cute whitey
so who sent them to you
i sent them
gittes laughs a little hysterically why would i be asking how you got them if i sent them
cmon level with me for once my tits in the wringer and its beginning to hurt
he hangs up
so he says you sent them
after a moment theyre all a bunch of phonies
gittes stops outside a door marked he enters an outer office
the secretary looks surprised
hes not in mr
may i ask what this is regarding
has he been out long
he glances at his watch and im late
he was expecting you
fifteen minutes ago
why dont i go in and wait
without waiting for a response he does
the secretary half rises in protest but gittes is through the inner door
the walls are covered with commendation photos of mulwray at various construction sites large maps of watershed areas and reservoirs in the city
on the desk is a framed tinted photo of evelyn in riding clothes
gittes moves to the desk watching the translucent pane in the upper half of the door leading to the outer office as he does
he begins to open and close the desk drawers after quickly examining the top
he tries one of the drawers and it doesnt open
he reopens the top drawer and the bottom one opens
he looks in it pulls out a checkbook
he opens it riffles through the stubs like he was shuffling cards
drops it finds a set of keys an old phone book and a menu from a water department lunch at the biltmore hotel in
then he flips through them reads one notation in mulwrays neat hand tues
oak pass res
gittes spots a shadow looming in front of the translucent pane
he quickly tosses item after item back kneeing the drawer nearly knocking a spare pair of mulwrays glasses off the desk top when he does
he catches them puts them on the desk and is pacing the room as the door opens
enters the room
an anxious secretary is right behind him
can i help you
extending his hand russ yelburton deputy chief in the department
equally pleasant j
and its not a departmental matter
i wonder if youd care to wait in my office
this is more a request than an invitation
gittes nods follows yelburton out through the outer office to his offices down the hall
continuing as theyre going you see this whole business in the paper with mr
mulwray has us all on edge
smaller than mulwrays he has most noticeably a lacquered marlin mounted on the wall
there are a couple of other pictures of yelburton with yellowtail and other fish hes standing beside
theres also a small burgee of a fish with the initials a
below it tacked onto the wall
after all you work with a man for a certain length of time you come to know him his habits his values and so forth
well either hes the kind who chases after women or he isnt
and mulwray isnt
he never even kids about it
maybe he takes it very seriously
yelburton chuckles appreciatively loosening up a little
you dont happen to know where mr
mulwrays having lunch
im sorry i well tell him ill be back
gittes spots a card tray on yelburtons desk
continuing mind if i take one of your cards
in case i want to get in touch with you again
gittes fishes a couple off the tray puts them in his handkerchief pocket
he goes out the door nearly running into a man who is standing by the secretarys desk about gittes age only a head taller and a foot wider dressed in
a plain suit that fits him about as well as a brown paper bag
mulvihlll what are you doing here
mulvihill stares at gittes with unblinking eyes remains by the desk
they shut my water off whats it to you
howd you find out
you dont drink it you dont take a bath in it maybe they sent you a letter
ah but then youd have to be able to read
mulvihill moves toward gittes shaking with fury
yelburton steps between them
continuing relax mulvihill glad to see you
to yelburton do you know claude mulvihill here
hes working for us
rings the bell
a powerful chinese butler with heavy hair and a half jacket of gold on one front tooth answers the door
gittes to see mr
he hands the chinese butler a card from his wallet
the butler takes it and disappears leaving gittes standing in the doorway
gittes stands and sweats watching a japanese gardener trim a hedge
theres a squeaking sound
gittes moves a few feet off the porch
a chauffeur is washing down a cream colored packard with a chamois
steam rises off the hood
the squeaking has obviously come from the chamois
gittes looks behind him
the chinese butler is gesturing for him to follow
follows him trying to check out the rooms as he goes
a maid is cleaning in the den
they pass through it out some french doors along a trellised walkway to a large pond with running water
you wait please
gittes is left standing by the pond
its suddenly very quiet except for the runnning water
the pond is over flowing
after a moment the gardener comes running back
he smiles at gittes probes into the pond
theres something gleaming in the bottom of it
gittes notes it
after a moment the gardener drops the long probe the waters recede
to gittes bad for glass
not understanding yeah sure
bad for glass
the gardener nods and is off leaving gittes staring at the object in the bottom of the pond that is gleaming
he looks at the tool the gardener was using hesitates picks it up and starts to probe into the pond himself toward the gleaming object
he then spots evelyn rounding a turn coming down the trellised pathway
he casually belts the probe holds onto it for poise
evelyn is wearing jeans that are lathered white on the inside of the thighs and laced with brown horsehair
shes wearing riding boots is perspiring a little but looks younger than she did in the office
gittes is a little taken aback at seeing evelyn
he is annoyed as well
nevertheless he is elaborately polite
actually im here to see your husband mrs
a little nervously
he waits for a reply
there is none
the chinese butler appears on the veranda
would you like something to drink
what are you having
fine thank you
chinese butler nods disappears evelyn sits at a glass topped table
gittes joins her
my husbands at the office
actually hes not
and hes moved from his apartment at the el macando
sharply thats not his apartment
the point is mrs
im not in business to be loved but i am in business and believe me whoever set up your husband set me up
s a small town people talk
he waits for a response
then continuing uneasily im just trying to make a living and i dont want to become a local joke
gittes youve talked me into it
ill drop the lawsuit
i said ill drop it
the iced tea comes on a tray which ramon sets down between them
continuing pleasantly so lets just drop the whole thing
as shes mixing one of the drinks yes mr
i dont want to drop it
evelyn looks up
gittes smiles a little sheepishly
i should talk this over with your husband
a little concerned why
what on earth for
look hollis seems to think youre an innocent man
well ive been accused of many things mrs
mulwray but never that
again he laughs a little nervously
again no reaction
continuing you see somebody went to a lot of trouble here and i want to find out lawsuit or no lawsuit
im not the one whos supposed to be caught with my pants down
so id like to see your husband
unless thats a problem
with a slight edge what do you mean
may i speak frankly mrs
you may if you can mr
determined to be polite well that little girlfriend she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course
maybe they disappeared together somewhere
with rising anger suppose they did
how does it concern you
nothing personal mrs
mulwray i just its very personal
it couldnt be more personal
is this a business or an obsession with you
look at it this way
now this phony broad excuse the language says shes you shes hired me
whoever put her up to it didnt have anything against me
they were out to get your husband
now if i see him i can help him
did you talk this morning
evelyn brushes lightly at the horsehair on her jeans
i went riding rather early
looks like you went quite a distance
no just riding bareback thats all
anyway you might try the oak pass or stone canyon reservoirs
sometimes at lunch hollis takes walks around them
otherwise hell be home by
ill stop by
please call first
gittes drives up a winding road following a flood channel up into the parched hills
one a rescue truck are at the entrance to the reservoir
the chain link fence with its keep out sign is open and there are people milling around
the reservoir is below
gittes car is stopped by a couple of uniformed police
sorry this is closed to the public sir
gittes hesitates only a moment then to the guard its all right
russ yelburton deputy chief in the department
he fishes out one of yelburtons cards from his handkerchief pocket hands it to the guard
go on down
gittes drives past the guards through the gate along the reservoir
he spots a police car and an unmarked one as well
gittes stops and gets out of the car
several men with their backs turned one talking quietly staring down into the reservoir where other men in small skiffs are apparently dredging for something
one of the men turns and sees gittes
he recognizes gittes and is visibly shocked
gittes for chrissakes
moving to gittes taking him by the arm cmon get out of here before loach tries to ease him down the path
what the hells going on
at the sound of his raised voice a man standing at the edge of the channel talking to two boys in swimming trunks turns around
hes a tall sleek mexican in his early thirties both gittes and escobar register considerable surprise at seeing one another
the men around them are extremely uneasy
loach is actually sweating
finally escobar smiles
without smiling how are you lou
i have a cold i cant seem to shake but other than that im fine
summer colds are the worst
yeah they are
gittes reaches into his pocket pulls out his cigarette case
no smoking sir
its a fire hazard this time of year
i think we can make an exception
ill see hes careful with the matches
lighting up thanks lou
howd you get past the guards
well to tell you the truth i lied a little
they walk a couple of steps
the other police two plainclothesmen and a uniformed officer watch them
youve done well by yourself
i get by
well sometimes it takes a while for a man to find himself and i guess you have
poking around in other peoples dirty linen
tell me you still throw chinamen into jail for spitting on the laundry
youre behind the times jake
theyve got steam irons now
smiles and im out of chinatown
since i made lieutenant
its apparent gittes is impressed despite himself
so what are you doing here
looking for someone
you seen him
id like to talk to him
youre welcome to try
there he is
escobar points down to the reservoir
a couple of men using poles with hooks are fishing about in the water
it can be seen that one of them has hooked something
the other man hooks it too
they pull revealing the soaking back of a mans coat
they start to pull the body into the skiff
are standing over the body of mulwray
escobar has the sheet drawn back
escobar drops the sheet
escobar and evelyn move a few feet to one side and whisper almost as though they were trying to keep the corpse from hearing them
it looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel
could he swim
obviously the fall must have knocked him out
evelyn nods slightly escobar coughs
a coroners assistant wheels the body out of the office
continuing this alleged affair he was having
the publicity didnt make him morose or unhappy
gittes has been sitting on a wooden bench smoking and listening
at this question he rises and looks through the doorway
escobar sees him ignores him
evelyn doesnt see him
well it didnt make him happy
but there is no possibility he would have taken his own life
a little uncomfortably now mrs
mulwray do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question
evelyn shows a flash of annoyance
do you know where she might be
escobar and evelyn move slowly toward the door
you and your husband never discussed her
stopping faltering he
he wouldnt tell me her name
we quarreled over her
it came as a complete surprise to me
a complete surprise
but i thought youd hired a private investigator
a private investigator
gesturing vaguely toward the door mr
evelyn looks up to see gittes standing in the doorway only a foot or two from her
she stops cold
they look at one another for a long moment
her eyes on gittes but i
did that because i thought it was a nasty rumor id put an end to
she finishes looks plaintively at gittes
escobar is right at her back
gittes says nothing
and when did mr
gittes inform you that these rumors had some foundation in fact
evelyn looks at escobar but doesnt know how to answer him
smoothly just before the story broke in the papers lou
they begin to walk slowly again have to move out of the way as some other corpse is being wheeled out of one of the coroner cubicles
you wouldnt happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman
or her name
they have walked a few steps further down the hall
will you need me for anything else lieutenant
i dont think so mrs
of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information well be in touch
ill walk her to her car be right back
evelyn glances at gittes
they go through a couple of outer doors and pass several reporters who have been in the outer hall laughing kidding the tag end of lines like only in l
and southern cafeteria
gittes hurries her past the reporters who flank them asking questions
gittes brushes them aside
in a small parking lot
evelyn fumbles in her bag looking feverishly for something in her purse
flushed perspiring just a minute
touching her gently you left your keys in the ignition
she glances down leans against the side of the car
continuing thank you for going along with me
i just didnt want to explain anything
ill send you a check
puzzled a check
evelyn gets in her car
to make it official i hired you
she drives off leaving gittes gaping
dont give me that lou
you hauled me down here for a statement
i dont want it anymore
it was an accident
you mean thats what youre going to call it
escobar looks up
contemptuously out of respect for his civic position
whatd he do lou make a pass at your sister
no he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people
but they werent very important just a bunch of dumb mexicans living by a dam
now beat it gittes you dont come out of this smelling like a rose you know
can you think of something to charge me with
when i do youll hear about it
gittes nods turns and walks down the hall
gittes stops by a body on the table the toe tagged with mulwrays name
morty is standing near it in a doorway to an adjoining room
a radio is on and with it the announcement that theyre about to hear another chapter in the life of lorenzo jones and his devoted wife belle
another coroners assistant sits at the table listening to the radio and eating a sandwich
gittes ambles into the room
a cigarette dangling out of his mouth jake whatre you doin here
nothin morty its my lunch hour i thought id drop by and see who died lately
gittes picks up the sheet and pulls it back
camera gets its first glimpse of mulwrays body
eyes open the face badly cut and bruised
aint that something
middle of a drought the water commissioner drowns
only in l
banged up pretty bad
thats a long fall
so how are you morty
morty is wheeling in another body with the help of an assistant
you know me jake
as he begins to move the body into the refrigerator he breaks into a wrenching spasm of coughing
gittes spots the other body lowers the sheet on mulwray
picking up on cough yeah so who you got there
morty pulls back the sheet
leroy shuhardt local drunk used to hang around fergusons alley
morty brushes some sand from the mans face laughs
continuing quite a character
lately hed been living in one of the downtown storm drains
had a bureau dresser down there and everything
gittes has already lost interest
he starts away
this stops gittes
yeah got dead drunk passed out in the bottom of the riverbed
a little puzzled yeah under hollenbeck bridge whats wrong with that
gittes has moved back to the body looks at it more closely
its bone dry morty
its not completely dry
yeah well he aint gonna drown in a damp riverbed either i dont care how soused he was
thats like drowning in a teaspoon
we got water out of him jake
gittes walks away mumbling
jesus this town
hes parked on an overpass
the sign hollenbeck bridge on one of its concrete columns
gittes looks down into the riverbed below
gittes can see the muddy remains of a collapsed shack its contents strewn down river from the bridge
below him lying half over the storm drain and one wall that was on the bank of the river is a sign that proclaims own your own office in this
building to which was used as a roof of sorts
downstream theres the dresser an oil drum a ford seat cushion an armour lard can etc
the trashy remains of shuhardts home
gittes scrambles down the embankment and as he lands near the storm drain one shoe sinks ankle deep into mud
gittes pulls it out swearing
he begins to walk a little further downstream when he hears the vaguely familiar squishy clop of something
clearing the bridge on the opposite side is the little mexican boy again on his swayback horse riding along the muddy bank
they look at one another a moment
calling out to him you were riding here the other day werent you
the boy doesnt answer
continuing speak english
didnt you talk to a man here
few days ago
the boy nods
continuing what did you talk about mind my asking
the shadows of the two are very long now
finally the water
what about the water
when it comes
when it comes
whatd you tell him
comes in different parts of the river
every night a different part
the horse snorts
the boy rides slowly on
gittes scrambles up the embankment to note the direction the storm drain by hollenbeck bridge takes
it is headed above toward the hollywood hills where the sun is setting
winding his way up a section of the hollywood hills
he picks up on an open flood channel with the spotlight by the drivers windwing
along the flood channel
it is dark now and gittes follows the channel with the car spotlight
he turns at a fork in the road which allows him to continue following the flood channel
the road is narrower
gittes drives more slowly
foliage is overgrown in the channel so its bottom cannot be glimpsed
the road is dirt
heavy clusters of oak trees and eucalyptus are everywhere
it is very still
another turn and a pie shaped view of a lake of lights in the city below can be over the road bolted
it says oak pass reservoir
keep the chain link itself actually extends over the flood channel and down into it making access along the channel itself impossible
gittes backs up turns off the motor the car lights the spotlight
a lone light overhead on tension wires is the sole illumination
there is only the eerie sound of the tension wires humming
gittes gets out of the car clubs the fence near the flood channel itself
gittes carefully works his way up through the thick foliage toward a second and large chain link fence
lights from the reservoir still higher above can be seen
suddenly there is a gunshot
gittes dives into the flood control channel which is at this point about four feet deep and six feet wide
there is the sound of men scurrying through the brush coming near him then retreating
gittes loses himself among the ivy in the channel
the men seem to have passed him by
but there is another sound now
an echoing growing sound
it puzzles gittes
he starts to lift his head to catch the direction
then hes inundated with a rush of water which pours over him knocks off his hat carries him down the channel banging into its banks as he desperately tries to
grab some of the overgrowth to hang on and pull himself out
but the force of the stream batters him and carries him with it until hes brought rudely to the chainlink fence
it stops him cold
hes nearly strained through it
swearing and choking he pulls himself out of the rushing water by means of the fence itself
drenched battered he slowly climbs back over the fence and makes his way toward his car
he fishes for his car keys looks down
one shoe is missing
grumbling goddam florsheim shoe goddammit
he starts to get into his car but mulvihill and a smaller man stop him
mulvihill pulling his coat down and pinning his arms holding him tightly
the smaller man thrusts a switchblade knife about an inch and a half up gittes left nostril
shaking with emotion hold it there kitty cat
frozen the knife in his nostril the street lamp overhead gleaming on the silvery blade
you are a very nosey fellow kitty cat
you know what happens to nosey fellows
the smaller man actually seems to be trembling with rage when he says this
gittes doesnt move
continuing wanna guess
okay lose their noses
with a quick flick the smaller man pulls back on the blade laying gittes left nostril open about an inch further
blood gushes down onto his shirt and coat
gittes bends over instinctively trying to keep the blood from getting on his clothes
mulvihill and the smaller man stare at him
continuing next time you lose the whole thing kitty cat
ill cut it off and feed it to my goldfish understand
tell him you understand gittes
gittes is now groveling on his hands and knees
mumbling i understand
gittes on the ground can see only his tormentors two tone brown and white wing tipped shoes lightly freckled with his blood
comes up and lightly shoves gittes into the ground
the sound of footsteps retreating gittes gasping
sits behind his desk back to camera not moving
duffy sits staring at nothing walsh moves uneasily around the room
the phone is ringing
pressing down intercom yeah sophie
a miss sessions calling
dont know her
take a number
a bandage spread eagled across gittes nose
so some contractor wants to build a dam and he makes a few payoffs
gittes turns slowly to walsh
he lightly taps his nose
continuing think you can nail mulvihill
theyll claim you were trespassing
i dont want mulvihill
i want the big boys that are making the payoffs
then whatll you do
sue the shit out of em
whats wrong with you guys
we find em sue em
well make a killing
a dazzling smile well have dinner at chasens twice a week well be pissing on ice the rest of our lives
sue people like that theyre liable to be having dinner with the judge whos trying the suit
gittes looks irritated
the phone rings again
miss ida sessions again
she says you know her
gittes picks up the phone
he winks to his boys
continuing hello miss sessions
i dont believe weve had the pleasure
oh yes we have
are you alone mr
clowning a little for the boys isnt everybody
what can i do for you miss sessions
walsh promptly starts to tell duffy the admiral byrd story
well im a working girl mr
i didnt come in to see you on my own
when did you come in
i was the one who pretended to be mrs
walsh has finished off the punch line and both men are laughing raucously
gittes drops the mail hes been loafing through and puts his hand over the receiver
to duffy and walsh shut the fuck up
then back to ida yes i remember nothing miss sessions just going over a detail or two with my associates
you were saying
well i never expected anything to happen like what happened to mr
mulwray the point is if it ever comes out i want somebody to know i didnt know what would happen
if you could tell me who employed you miss sessions
that could help us both
why dont you give me your address and we can talk this over
just look in the obituary column of todays times
the obituary column
youll find one of those people
she hangs up
gittes looks to his two men
gittes is seated flips through the paper until he finds the obituary column scans it looks up abruptly tears the column from the paper and puts it in his pocket
when he closes the paper we can see headlines in the left hand column water bond issue passes council
ten million dollar referendum to go before the public
evelyn mulwray is standing at the table as he does so
he rises allows her to sit
gittes watches her as she removes her gloves slowly
shes wearing dove gray gabardine subdued tailored
thanks for coming
the waiters appeared
evelyn is looking at gittes nose
tom collins with lime not lemon please
evelyn looks down and smoothes her gloves
when she looks back up she stares expectantly at gittes
gittes pulls out a torn envelope
the initials ecm can be seen in a delicate scroll on the corner of it
i got your check in the mall
as i said i was very grateful
gittes fingers the envelope
mulwray im afraid thats not good enough
a little embarrassed well how much would you like
the moneys fine
its generous but youve shortchanged me on the story
coolly i have
i think so
something besides your husbands death was bothering you
you were upset but not that upset
icily dont tell me how i feel
the drinks come
the waiter sets them down
look you sue me your husband dies you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato and all of it quicker than wind from a ducks ass
then you ask me to lie to the police
it wasnt much of a lie
if your husband was killed it was
meaning check this can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence
but he wasnt killed
i think youre hiding something mrs
evelyn remains unperturbed
well i suppose i am
actually i knew about the affair
how did you find out
he told you
continuing and you werent the slightest bit upset about it
i was grateful
evelyn for the first time appears a little embarrassed
youll have to explain that mrs
a flash of annoyance look i do matrimonial work its my metiay
when a wife tells me shes happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience
gittes looks significantly to evelyn
looking directly at her shes cheating on him
evelyn doesnt reply
continuing were you
evelyn is clearly angry but she is controlling it
i dont like the word cheat
did you have affairs
did he know
almost an outburst well i wouldnt run home and tell him whenever i went to bed with someone if thats what you mean
this subdues gittes a little
evelyn is still a little heated
continuing more calmly is there anything else you want to know
where you were when your husband died
i cant tell you
you mean you dont know where you were
i mean i cant tell you
you were seeing someone too
evelyn looks squarely at him
she doesnt deny it
for very long
i dont see anyone for very long mr
its difficult for me
now i think you know all you need to about me
i didnt want publicity
i didnt want to go into any of this then or now
is this all
oh by the way
whats the c stand for
hes been fingering the envelope
she stammers slightly k
that your maiden name
evelyn turns into gittes
you mustve had a reason to ask me that
im just a snoop
you seem to have had a reason for every other question
no not for that one
i dont believe you
gittes suddenly turns sharply in to evelyn
moving in do me a favor
sit still and act like im charming
evelyn involuntarily draws back
continuing theres somebody here
something like were being intimate
evelyn reluctantly allows gittes to move closer and dangle his hand in front of their faces
she stares at him
meaning his nose how did it happen
quietly been meaning to talk to you about that
quietly maybe putting your nose in other peoples business
quietly more like other people putting their business in my nose
evelyn actually smiles a little
you son of a bitch
gittes looks up and flashes his smile
match is swaying over the table a plump woman with a glass of whiskey in one hand a large purse in the other and a menacing look in her eye
dont give me that you son of a bitch
gittes turns back to evelyn
softly another satisfied client
another satisfied clients wife
look at me you son of a bitch
are you happy are you happy now
she tries to take a swipe at gittes with her purse
gittes covers himself
waiters rush over
you smug son of a bitch
my husbands so upset he sweats all night
how do you think that makes me feel
match swings at gittes again and again
she catches him on the nose
he covers it then swings his leg out from under the table and deftly kicks her in the shin
match drops her purse and spills her drink
she grabs her shin hopping around a little
the waiters who had tried to restrain her now try to keep her from falling over
lets get out of here before she picks up her purse
they rise and move toward the door
quietly tough guy huh
gittes looks sees shes kidding and nods
gittes car has been brought by the parking attendant
the attendant opens the passenger side for evelyn
ive got my own car
the creamcolored packard
to attendant who dutifully starts for her car wait a minute sonny
to evelyn i think you better come with me
theres nothing more to say
to attendant get my car please
the attendant starts after it again
gittes leans on the open door of his car and in to evelyn
he talks quietly but spits it out
okay go home
but in case youre interested your husband was murdered
somebodys dumping tons of water out of the city reservoirs when were supposedly in the middle of a drought he found out and he was killed
theres a waterlogged drunk in the morgue
involuntary manslaughter if anybody wants to take the trouble which they dont
it looks like half the city is trying to cover it all up which is fine with me
now inches from her i goddam near lost my nose
and i like it
i like breathing through it
and i still think youre hiding something
evelyn steadies herself on the open car door
she stares at gittes for a long moment
then he gently tugs the car door closed
he drives off into the wilshire traffic leaving evelyn looking after him
gittes goes through the door to the secretary
she looks up
she recognizes gittes again and is not happy to see him
gittes to see mr
the secretary immediately gets up and goes into the inner office
gittes turns and strolls around the office a moment
he sees a photographic display of the history of the dwp
the early years along the wall
he stops as he spots a photo of the man with the cane gittes had seen photos of earlier
he is standing high in the mountains near a pass
the caption reads julian cross
cross is strikingly handsome
gittes immediately pulls out the envelope containing evelyns check
he looks at the corner of it his thumb pressing down under the middle initial c then he looks back to the photos
the secretary returns
yelburton will be busy for some time
well im on my lunch hour
hes liable to be tied up indefinitely
i take a long lunch
all day sometimes
gittes pulls out a cigarette case offers the secretary one
he lights up and begins to hum the way you look tonight strolling along the wall looking at more photographs
here he spots several photos of a much younger mulwray along with julian cross
one of the captions hollis mulwray and
gittes still humming turns to the secretary
julian cross worked for the water department
looking up yes
humming then he did or he didnt
he owned it
gittes is genuinely surprised at this
he owned the water department
he owned the entire water supply for the city
really surprised how did they get it away from him
a sigh then mr
mulwray felt the public should own the display
if youll just read the display
glances back hums then mulwray
i thought you said cross owned the department
along with mr
they were partners
yes they were partners
she gets up annoyed and goes into yelburtons inner office
gittes goes back to the photographs
he hears a scratching sound apparently coming from just outside the outer door
he moves quickly to it hesitates swiftly opens the door
workmen are behind it scraping away mulwrays name on the outer door looking up at gittes in some surprise
the secretary returns sees the workman on the floor
to gittes mr
yelburton will see you now
gittes nods graciously heads on into yelburtons office
there is a subtle but perceptible difference in yelburtons attitude
hes now head of the department
gittes sorry to keep you waiting
these staff meetings they just go on and on
yeah must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances
hollis was the best department head the citys ever had
my goodness what happened to your nose
smiles i cut myself shaving
you ought to be more careful
that must really smart
only when i breathe
laughing only when you breathe
dont tell me youre still working for mrs
i never was
stops smiling i dont understand
neither do i actually
but you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me
gittes youre not making a bit of sense
well look at it this way mr
mulwray didnt want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around so
you decided to ruin it
then he found out that you were dumping water every night
then he was drowned
thats an outrageous accusation
i dont know what youre talking about
well whitey mehrholtz over at the times will
dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought
gittes heads toward the door
please sit down mr
well were not anxious for this to get around but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley
as you know the farmers there have no legal right to our water and since the drought weve had to cut them off
the city comes first naturally
but well weve been trying to help some of them out keep them from going under
naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff
yeah a little runoff
where are those orchards
i said the northwest valley
thats like saying theyre in arizona
gittes my field men are out and i cant give you an exact location
youre a married man am i right
hard working have a wife and kids
i dont want to nail you
i just want to know who put you up to it
ill give you a few days to think it over
hands him a card call me
i can help
maybe we can lay the whole thing off on a few big shots and you can stay head of the department for the next twenty years
gittes smiles leaves an unsmiling yelburton
gittes enters drops his hat on sophies desk
sophie tries to tell him something but gittes goes on into his office
is sitting smoking
she looks up when he enters
whats your usual salary
gittes moves to his desk barely breaking stride at the sight of her
thirty five bucks daily for me twenty for each of my operators plus expenses plus my fee if i show results
hes sitting now
evelyn is very pale now obviously very shaken
whoevers behind my husbands death why have they gone to all this trouble
how they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs that i dont know
ill pay your salary plus five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to hollis and who is involved
gittes buzzes sophie
sophie draw up one of our standard forms for mrs
he leans back to evelyn tell me did you get married before or after mulwray and your father sold the water department
evelyn nearly jumps at the question
continuing your father is julian cross isnt he
yes of course
it was quite a while after
i was just out of grade school when they did that
so you married your fathers business partner
she lights another cigarette
continuing staring at her points to the ashtray youve got one going mrs
she quickly stubs one out
is there something upsetting about my asking about your father
yes a little
you see hollis and my fa
my father had a falling out
over the water department or over you
quickly not over me
why would they have a falling out over me
noting her nervousness then it was over the water department
well i mean yes
yes and no
hollis felt the public should own the water but i dont think my father felt that way
actually it was over the van der lip
the dam that broke
he never forgave him for it
never forgave him for what
for talking him into building it he never forgave my father
they havent spoken to this day
starts a little you sure shout that
of course im sure
what about you
do you and your father get along
sophie comes in with the form cutting off evelyns reply
gittes places two copies on a coffee table in front of evelyn
the other copys for you
she signs it
when she looks back up gittes is staring intently at her
what are you thinking
picking up one of copies folding it putting it in his pocket before this i turned on the faucet it came out hot and cold i didnt think there was
a thing to it
the engines make the small cabin vibrate
gittes threads his way down the tiny aisle of the eight passenger cabin which is full of middle aged men in old clothes and their fishing gear
gittes is poked by a pole has to move along
one of the old men says something to him
above the engines what
youll have to sit with the pilot
gittes moves forward into the cockpit the pilot looks up nods for gittes to sit down first moving a half eaten cheese sandwich out of gittes seat
taxiing down the ramp into the sea
in a moment it kicks up a spray of foam and takes off
the island gradually looming larger before the pilot and gittes
the pilot glances over at gittes who as usual is impeccably dressed
a contrast to the others on the plane
above the engines well youre not going fishing
gittes shakes his head
winks but thats what you told your wife
the pilot laughs raucously
gittes laughs politely
lots of fellas do
tell the little woman theyre going on a fishing trip then shack up with some little twist on the island
abruptly im going to see a man called julian cross
ever heard of him
is the pope catholic
who are you mister
i ask because he doesnt see a whole lot of people
im working for his daughter
surprised that right
she used to be some looker
she aint exactly long in the tooth now
she must be about thirty three thirty four
you must be thinking of a different daughter
no hes only got one i remember her age i read it in the newspapers when she ran away
she ran away
oh yeah it was a big thing at the time
julian cross daughter
she was a wild little thing
he gives a sidelong glance to gittes a little concerned hes said too much
continuing course she settled down nicely
smiling a little well you never know do you
loosening up thats for sure
whyd she run away
oh you know
she was sixteen or seventeen
nudging him we missed the best of it didnt we pal
both men laugh a little lewdly
she ran off to mexico
rumor was she was knocked up and didnt even know who the father was
went there to get rid of it
you dont say
cross was looking for her all over the country
offered rewards everything
felt real sorry for him with all his money
a pleasant but unobtrusive clapboard blue and white building on the bay overlooking the harbor
the seaplane lands
a motor launch with a burgee of a fish flying from it turns and heads in the direction of the plane
gittes driven in a station wagon passes under the sign with a cross painted below the name
the ranch itself is only partially in a valley on the island
as the wagon continues one can see that it is actually a miniature california encompassing desert mountains and canyon that tumble down palisades to the windward side of the sea
the wagon comes to a halt where a group of hands are clustered around a corral
the circle of men drift apart leaving julian cross standing using a cane for support reedy but handsome in a rough linen shirt and jeans
when he talks his strong face is lively in repose it looks ravaged
walking toward the main house
a classic monterey
a horse led on a halter by another ranch hand slows down and defecates in the center of the path they are taking
gittes doesnt notice
gittes pauses not certain he has heard correctly
i said horseshit
yes sir thats what it looks like
ill give you that
cross pauses when they reach the dung pile
he removes his hat and waves it inhales deeply
love the smell of it
a lot of people do but of course they wont admit it
look at the shape
gittes glances down out of politeness
continuing smiling almost enthusiastic always the same
cross walks on
not one to let it go always
oh damn near yes
unless the animals sick or something
stops and glances
back and the steam rising off it like that in the morning
thats life mr
they move on
continuing perhaps this preoccupation with horseshit may seem a little perverse but i ask you to remember this
one way or another its what ive dealt in all my life
lets have breakfast
below them is a corral where hands take arabians one by one and work them out letting them run and literally kick up their heels
cross attention is diverted by the animals from time to time
an impeccable mexican butler serves them their main course broiled fish
you know youve got a nasty reputation mr
i like that
if you were a bank president that would be one thing but in your business its admirable
and its good advertising
it doesnt hurt
its why you attract a client like my daughter
but im surprised youre still working for her unless shes suddenly come up with another husband
she happens to think the last one was murdered
cross is visibly surprised
how did she get that idea
i think i gave it to her
oh i hope you dont mind
i believe they should be served with the head
gittes glances down at the fish whose isinglass eye is glazed over with the heat of cooking
fine as long as you dont serve chicken that way
laughs tell me
what do the police say
theyre calling it an accident
whos the investigating officer
lou escobar hes a lieutenant
do you know him
we worked in chinatown together
would you call him a capable man
far as it goes
of course he has to swim in the same water we all do
of course but youve got no reason to think hes bungled the case
thats too bad
it disturbs me mr
it makes me think youre taking my daughter for a ride
financially speaking of course
how much are you charging her
carefully my usual fee plus a bonus if i come up with any results
are you sleeping with her
come come mr
you dont have to think about that to remember do you
if you want an answer to that question i can always put one of my men on the job
good afternoon mr
youre dealing with a disturbed woman whos lost her husband
i dont want her taken advantage of
you may think you know what youre dealing with but believe me you dont
this stops gittes
he seems faintly mused by it
why is that funny
its what the d
used to tell me about chinatown
was he right
continuing exactly what do you know about me mr
mainly that youre rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers
grunts then course im respectable
politicians ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough
ill double whatever your fees are and ill pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find hollis girlfriend
yes his girlfriend
you mean the little chippie he was with at the el macando
shes disappeared hasnt she
doesnt that strike you as odd
shes probably scared to death
wouldnt it be useful to talk to her
if mulwray was murdered she was probably one of the last people to see him
you didnt see mulwray much did you
when was the last time
cross starts to reply then theres the sound of a mariachi band and some men in formation clear a bluff about a hundred yards off
they are dressed like spanish dons on horseback
for the most part they are fat in the saddle and pass along in disordered review to the music
sheriffs gold posse
bunch of damn fools who pay apiece to the sheriffs reelection
i let em practice up out here
do you remember the last time you talked to mulwray
cross shakes his head
at my age you tend to lose track
well it was about five days ago
you were outside the pig n whistle and you had one hell of an argument
cross looks to gittes in some real surprise
continuing ive got the photographs in my office
if theyll help you remember
what was the argument about
a long pause then my daughter
what about her
just find the girl mr
i think she is frightened and i happen to know hollis was fond of her
id like to help her if i can
i didnt realize you and hollis were so fond of each other
cross looks hatefully at gittes
hollis mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune
we were a lot closer than evelyn realized
if you want to hire me i still have to know what you and mulwray were arguing about
shes an extremely jealous person
i didnt want her to find out about the girl
how did you find out
ive still got a few teeth in my head mr
gittes and a few friends in town
my secretaryll send you a letter of agreement
tell me are you worried about that girl or what evelyn might do to her
just find the girl
ill look into it as soon as i check out some avocado groves
well be in touch mr
dark and quiet except for the whirring of fans
gittes approaches one of the clerks at a desk
im a little lost
where can i find the plat books for the northwest valley
the clerks droopy eyes widen a little
part of its in ventura county
we dont have ventura county in our hall of records
which is a snotty remark
ill settle for l
regards him then row twenty three section c
the clerk turns away abruptly
gittes regards his back a moment then goes to the stacks
gittes sees the clerk turn to another say something
the second clerk gets on the phone
gittes watches a moment then swiftly turns his attention to the stacks
he hauls down the northwest valley volume opens it
its huge and theres a lot to go through
the print itself makes him squint
showing tract lot parcel even a metes and bounds designation where the description of the land parcel is long and hopelessly involved e
paces to rio seco thence paces to loma linda etc
these descriptions are old and faded
in the owners column however there are numerous freshly typed names pasted over the prior owners
hauls the huge volume back to the clerks desk
to clerk say
the clerk turns sharply around
how come all these new names are pasted into the plat book
land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week
gittes looks a little surprised
then these are all new owners
astonished but that means that most of the valleys been sold in the last few months
if thats what it says
can i check one of these volumes out
quietly snotty sir this is not a lending library its the hall of records
well then how about a ruler
the prints pretty fine
i forgot my glasses
id like to be able to read across
the exasperated clerk reaches around rummages slaps a ruler on the desk
gittes goes back to the stacks with the ruler
he opens the book places the ruler not horizontally but vertically
beside the owner column he places the ruler looks toward the clerks then swiftly rips down the page tearing out a strip about two inches wide containing the owners name
and property description
as he tears he either sniffles or coughs to cover the sound of the paper being ripped
amidst a hall of shimmering dust and heat parched and drying groves narrower roads
he passes a ramshackle home next to a rotting orchard
there is a sold sign on the collapsing barn
gittes stops checks it against the names he had taken from the hall of records
and a few withered pepper trees
gittes has paused at this dried up intersection
there is a sold sign on a drug store
gittes looks off screen
coming into view above the arid fields is a spiraling cloud of purple smoke
gittes heads in that direction
gittes parks at the edge of the field
about twenty yards away is a man mounted on a strange machine holding a lid off it
billowing lavender clouds are belching forth
several children are watching the man at work
to one of the children say pal whats he doing
making some rain
gittes nods walks over to the man who is elaborately busying himself with the intricacies of his machine
hes aware of gittes watching him
well youre just the man im looking for
the rainmaker now glances down at gittes who as usual is immaculately dressed
some associates and i are thinking of buying property out here
of course were worried about the rainfall
the rainmaker steps down
no problem with me on the job
glancing around at the desolate dry field do you have any references
city of la habra heights filled an gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days
nods thats swell
but how about here
pulling out names from his pocket ever worked for robert knox emma dill clarence speer marian parsons or jasper lamar crabb
never heard of em
climbing back up lot of turnover these days
better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land
yeah ill do that
is now covered with a film of dust he reaches a fork in the dirt road
there are a couple of mailboxes
gittes takes this fork and begins a slow ascent
as he does the tops of a line of bright green trees can be seen coming more and more into view row upon row of avocado and walnut groves their
the few structures in the distance are white washed and well kept right down to the white washed stones that mark the pathway to the home
towering above it all is a huge wooden water tank
gittes drives through a gate that has no trespassing and keep out private property signs neatly printed on it
he drives down the road into the grove
pulls to a halt in the road flanking the orchard lanes
he puts the car in neutral stares at the trees
by contrast with what he has seen they are lush and beautiful their heavy branches barely swaying in a light breeze
then a shotgun blast abruptly strips bare the branches of the tree hed been staring at
gittes is shocked
he looks behind him
riding on horseback down the field in the direction he had just driven is a red faced man in overalls
his hat blows off his head
he does not however lose the shotgun he has just used
gittes lane of retreat is denied him
he guns the car and takes off down one of the orchard lanes
the dirt lane is rough
as gittes nears the end of it a younger man on a mule blocks the exit
gittes veers a sharp left knocking a branch off one of the trees heading down one of the cross lanes
here hes pursued by a scraggly dog that nips at the tires
gittes yells at it
two farmers on foot one using a crutch run down the lanes toward a dust trail rising above the trees
theyve spotted it
clearly its from gittes car
this hide and seek chase between one man on horseback one on a mule and a couple on foot continues up and down and across the orchard lanes until gittes
front tire and radiator are ruptured by another shotgun blast
gittes car veers off scattering a stray gaggle of geese and smacks into an avocado tree shaking loose a barrage of the heavy fruit onto gittes and the car
gittes immediately tries to get out through the branches over the back of his car but hes pulled off it by one of the younger farmers a huge brute who
he begins to tussle with
the crippled farmer begins to bang gittes on the back with his crutch
the two of them manage to pound gittes to the ground within moments where the crippled farmer continues to whack away at gittes with the crutch
the older red faced farmer with the shotgun and the man on a mule ride up
all right quit it
search the man see if hes armed
gittes is hefted half off the ground and the two younger farmers spin him around going through his clothes
gittes is badly banged up and half out on his feet
they toss his wallet his silver cigarette case etc
on the ground
i said see if hes armed not empty his pockets
he aint armed
gittes leans against the back of his car breathing heavily
all right mister
who you with
water department or the real estate office
gittes back is to the red faced farmer
he has trouble catching his breath
the crippled farmer pokes him rudely in the back with his crutch
gittes turns sharply
to crippled farmer get away from me
touch me with that thing again and youll need a pair of them
shoving gittes whynt you pick on somebody your own size
i said cut that out
give him a chance to say something
gittes looks up at the red faced farmer
reaching down for his wallet names gittes
im a private investigator and im not with either one
then what are you doing out here
client hired me to see
whether or not the water departments been irrigating your land
irrigating my land
exploding the water departments been sending you people to blow up my water tanks
they threw poison down three of my wells
i call that a funny way to irrigate
whod hire you for a thing like that
gittes reaches into his pocket
the papers on the ground
he picks it up
thats the son of a bitch whos done it to us
you dont know what youre talking about you dumb oakie
the big farmer takes a swing at gittes
gittes kicks him squarely in the nuts knees him in the jaw after hes doubled up and hits him solidly
the crippled farmer takes careful aim and brings his crutch down on the back of gittes head
gittes is knocked to the ground and lies still beside the big farmer who is writhing in agony in the dirt
well thats that
theres a purling sound which soon becomes defined into the sound of voices talking quietly about whether to move or not to move doctors etc
is staring down at gittes whos lying in the screened in porch of the farmers
his wife the red faced farmer and the big farmer are there along with the dog
the red faced farmers wife has set tea out
the farmers all of them now seem awkward and a little embarrassed
he focuses on evelyn who sits right next to him
hes got dried blood down the side of his face from his nose a huge mouse on his cheek and his clothes are torn in a couple of spots
to evelyn whats going on
quietly almost as if he were in a hospital you didnt look too good so we thought we better call your employer
he checks his watch
he looks out
its almost evening
gittes says nothing
the wife of the red faced farmer dubois looks reproachfully at dubois
gittes feels the back of his head it obviously hurts him
evelyn and gittes go out to her car the cream colored packard
dubois accompanies them along with the big farmer who is carrying a crate of something
gittes has cleaned himself up a little
look here if its all the same with you well get your car patched up
if youll tell me what your trousers run you ill make good on them mr
its okay mr
to evelyn its just that theyre after everybody out here tearing up our irrigation ditches trying to make our land worthless so they can pick it up for twenty five
dollars an acre
earl here is sorry too
he wants to give you something to take back with you
earl has the huge crate hes holding brim full of avocados
thanks for coming
gittes pulls out cigarette case takes one offers one to evelyn who refuses
that dam is a con job
the one your husband opposed
theyre conning l
into building it only the water wont go to l
itll go here
everything you can see everything around us
i was at the hall of records today
whips out papers turns on the car light that bother you
looking over papers in the last three months robert knox has bought acres emma dill acres clarence speer acres and jasper lamar crabb acres
jasper lamar crabb
no i think id remember
theyve been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts
have any idea what this landll be worth with a steady water supply
about thirty million more than they paid
and hollis knew about it
its why he was killed
jasper lamar crabb
jasper lamar crabb
hes pulling out his wallet excitedly now spilling its contents onto the seat
he pulls out the obituary column hed folded up earlier in the day
continuing we got it
we got it baby
what is it
there was a memorial service at the mar vista inn today for jasper lamar crabb
he died three weeks ago
is that unusual
two weeks ago he bought those acres
evelyns car pulls up before the elegant spanish rest home its entryway illuminated by streetlights
there is a small sign giving the name of the place in elegant neon scroll
it sits on the rolling green lawns
gittes gets out of the car with evelyn
he offers her his arm and they go up the walkway to the entrance
gittes and evelyn are approached by an unctuous man in his forties with a flower in his buttonhole
he sees evelyn first
hello there im mr
can i help you folks
then he gets a clear look at gittes bruised trousers torn etc
yes i sure hope so
indicating his disheveled appearance i just cant handle him anymore can i sweetheart
evelyn shakes her head
oh my goodness
hastily nothing to do with dad
its me actually
they just dont get along very well
dads a lamb with anyone else
not so sure oh well i dont know
naturally i want the best for him money is no object
perhaps if we could meet your father
theres just one question
do you accept anyone of the jewish persuasion
evelyn cant quite conceal her surprise at the question
very embarrassed im sorry
smoothly dont be sorry neither does dad
wanted to make sure though didnt we honey
evelyn stares back at gittes amused and appalled
she manages to nod
just to be certain i wonder if you could show us a list of your patients
polite but pointed we dont reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy
i know youd appreciate that if your father came to live with us
gittes locks eyes with palmer
confidentially thats exactly what we wanted to hear
i wonder is it too late for us to have a look around
i dont think so
be happy to show you
would you mind if we took a stroll on our own
just if you will confine yourself to the main building
its nearly bedtime
we understand cmon sweetheart
he takes evelyn
either by accident or design the primarily octogenarian guests have segregated themselves
in one wing the men are playing pinochle some are playing dominoes one elderly gentleman sits by himself carefully peeling an orange
in an adjacent parlor several white headed ladies work on a quilt
gittes grabs evelyns hand
quietly theyre all here
every goddam name
gittes points to the wall
it says activities board
there are titles
below them are the names of the guests entered under certain activities for certain days
after evelyn looks she turns to gittes
continuing indicating the ancients around them youre looking at the owners of a acre empire
astonished they cant be
they may not know it but they are
gittes strolls toward the women knitting and working on the quilt
two of the ladies giggle
the third continues to busy herself with her quilt off by herself
continuing which one of you is emma dill
two of them say she is and point in different directions
the third gives them a curt look and goes back to her knitting
gittes approaches her
are you emma
some old voice is singing softly dont sit under the apple tree
ive been wanting to meet you
did you know that youre a very wealthy woman
stitching smiles im not
well you own a lot of land
oh some time ago my late husband owned a good deal of beach property in long beach but we lost it
gittes looks at the quilt
in it is the head of a fish among the rest of the crazy quilt pattern
gittes spots it
thats just lovely
he looks through the quilt for other pieces of the fish comes across the tail and by it the initials a
indicating tail where did you get this material
what it sounds like the apple core club
the apple core
its a fish
my grandsons a member and they take very nice care of us
how do they do that
give us things
not just some old flag like this but kneeling but what
were a sort of unofficial charity of theirs mr
would you care to come this way
someone wants to see you
gittes looks up sees palmer standing in the doorway looking taut and a little drawn
evelyn is beside him
she gestures as if theres someone behind palmer
see you later emma
he walks toward palmer who waits for him to walk in front
hes got his hand in his pocket
evelyn looks to gittes
the four of them stand there mulvihill towering over everyone
come on i want you to meet somebody gittes
glancing from palmer to mulvihill can we leave the lady out of this
a little uncertain yeah why not
okay id like to walk her to her car
taking her by the arm get in the car
ill see she makes it
mulvihill has walked up beside gittes
he makes the mistake of opening the glass door in the entryway putting his back to gittes for a moment
gittes swiftly pulls mulvihills jacket up over his head
he spins him around
with his jacket covering his face gittes hammers away at mulvihlll beating him against the glass door along the wall mercilessly pounding his fists into the cloth until the cloth
turns red and mulvihill begins to sink to the red tile floor
evelyn stands there astonished
mulvihills gun has clattered to the floor
as mulvihill hits the floor to evelyn what are you waiting for
get in the car
mulvihill tries to get up again
palmer starts to go for the gun nearly picking it up
gittes slaps it out of his hand and kicks it
it goes flying down the hall at least thirty feet hits the wall
palmer goes screaming off into the night
gittes turns back to mulvihill who starts to get up then collapses
gittes goes out the front door ignoring the excited audience of ancients behind him
as gittes walks down the pathway he stops
two men are coming toward him
one of them is shorter and has the nervous jerky moves of the man who slit his nose
the two men fan out and continue to move toward him
gittes spots the two tone shoes
he begins to back up
suddenly there is a pair of headlights flashing brilliantly behind the two men
in a moment evelyns car is headed across the lawn directly toward the two men accelerating as it gets near them
they look in disbelief then dive for safety
the car skids to a stop fishtailing a little on the grass
evelyn opens the passenger door
gittes jumps in and she takes off across the lawn tilting the elegant little neon sign on the lawn as she goes
two evelyn looking straight ahead driving
after a moment she takes one hand off the wheel and rubs her left eye a little
gittes watches her
gittes stands on the veranda smoking a cigarette staring off into the night
evelyn comes out to the veranda carrying a tray with whiskey and an ice bucket on it
she sets it down
watching her pour maids night off
a little surprised he laughs what do you mean why
nobodys here thats all
handing gittes his drink i gave everybody the night off
easy its an innocent question
no question from you is innocent mr
laughing i guess not to you mrs
frankly you really saved my a
my neck tonight
tell me something
does this usually happen to you mr
whats that mrs
well im only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening but if thats how you go about your work id say youre lucky to get through a
pouring himself another drink actually this hasnt happened to me in some time
when was the last time
i dont know why
gittes touches his nose winces a little
it was in chinatown
what were you doing there
taking a long drink working for the district attorney
gittes looks sharply at her
then as little as possible
the district attorney gives his men advice like that
they do in chinatown
she looks at him
gittes stares off into the night
evelyn has poured herself another drink
bothers you to talk about it doesnt it
gittes gets up
do you have any peroxide or something
he touches his nose lightly
she takes his hand and leads him back into the house
gittes pulls the plaster off his nose stares at it in the mirror
evelyn takes some hydrogen peroxide and some cotton out of a medicine cabinet
evelyn turns gittes head toward her
she has him sit on the pullman tile adjacent to the sink
doctor did a nice job
she begins to work on his nose with the peroxide
then she sees his cheek checks back in his hair
continuing boy oh boy youre a mess
working on him so why does it bother you to talk about it
bothers everybody who works there but to me
you cant always tell whats going on there
why was it
i thought i was keeping someone from being hurt and actually i ended up making sure they were hurt
could you do anything about it
theyre very close now as shes going over a mouse very near his eye
make sure i dont find myself in chinatown anymore
wait a second
he takes hold of her and pulls her even closer momentarily freezing whats wrong
what about it
staring intently theres something black in the green part of your eye
not moving oh that
its a flaw in the iris
she almost shivers yes sort of a birthmark
gittes kisses her lightly gradually rises until hes standing holding her
she hesitates then wraps her arms around him
on a nightstand city lights visible through the open window behind it
it is ringing
evelyns arm reaches into shot
sound of something hitting the headboard
view shifts to include gittes in bed holding his head which hes just hit
evelyn pauses in her reach to the phone
she turns to him whispers im sorry kisses him on the head and lips
phone continues to ring
she picks it up
in spanish now no no ill come and help just keep watching her and dont do anything until i get there
view shifts again to include gittes in bed watching evelyn next to him as shes talking on the phone
she hangs up
she touches gittes cheek lightly
i have to go
gittes stares at her silently
i have to
and i want to know where
she starts out of bed please dont be angry
believe me its got nothing to do with you
stopping her where are you going
near tears please
trust me this much
she kisses him lightly ill be back
look there is something i should tell you
the fishing club that old lady mentioned the pieces off the flag
the albacore club
it has to do with my father
he owns it
i saw him
sitting up straight you saw my fa
panicked you didnt tell me
there hasnt been a lot of time
she leaps out of bed throwing on a robe
what did he say
insistent what did he say
that you were jealous and he was worried about what you might do
mulwrays girlfriend for one thing
he wanted to know where she was
evelyn starts quickly for the bathroom then comes back and kneels by the side of the bed takes gittes hand
i want you to listen to me
my father is a very dangerous man
you dont know how dangerous
you dont know how crazy
give me an example
you may think you know whats going on but you dont
thats what your father said
youre telling me hes in back of this whole thing
including the death of your husband
please dont ask me any more questions now
just wait wait for me
ill be back
i need you here
she kisses him rushes to the bathroom shuts the door
gittes stares at it a moment
then leaps out of bed rummages around tosses on his trousers
he grabs his shoes throws them on
then hurries out of the bedroom
running across the driveway to the garage
there are two cars there
mulwrays buick and evelyns packard
gittes moves over to the buick opens the passengers door
checks the ignition
no key is in it
he pulls a couple of wires from under the dash starts to mess with them seems satisfied
slides out across the seat slams the door
gittes hurries over to the packard
he gets down on the driveway lying on his back bracing himself
with the heel of his shoe he kicks at the right rear taillight of the car
he shatters the red lens gets up
he carefully pulls the red lens off the taillight exposing the white light beneath it
he tosses the red lens into the shrubbery and hurries back toward the house
evelyns car speeds along the curves on sunset boulevard the red and white lights coming in and out of view
behind the wheel of mulwrays car keeping a healthy distance from evelyn in front of him
pulls up before a small little bungalow house
she gets out looks up and down the street
there is nothing
she hurries on up the walkway to the front door
idles the engine with the lights off
he brings the car a few yards further down the street parking it near evelyns
gittes gets out of the car and goes up the walkway
the curtains are drawn except for one of the small windows on the side of the house
he goes to it and looks balancing on the edge of the porch
gittes sees evelyns oriental servant rush through the living room of the small house
in a moment he re emerges back through the living room carrying a tray with a glass and pitcher on it
around to the side of the house
he runs into shrubbery and a short picket fence
he climbs over it follows along the stucco wall to a series of windows at the corner of the house
these all have shades on them
he can hear someone crying in the house
someone else talking alternately firmly and plaintively in spanish
here the windows have blinds
he moves to one where the blind is not completely drawn
theres an inch or so of space at the bottom
gittes can see the servant again
evelyn is pacing back and forth in and out of his line of vision
after a moment someone rises into shot obviously from lying on a bed
the figure is just a few feet from evelyn
her tear stained face comes into view
it is unmistakably the girl gittes had last seen with hollis mulwray
shes looking up to evelyn speaking in spanish
her words are not discernible but the tone is bitter anguished
a newspaper is strewn about the room
she insists that the girl swallow down some pills
the girl reluctantly does
continues to watch
emerges from the house goes to her car and gets in
evelyn sees gittes sitting in her car staring coldly at her
okay give me the keys
stunned furious you bastard
its either that or you drive to the police yourself
youve got your husbands girlfriend tied up in there
shes not tied up
you know what i mean
youre keeping her there against her will
i am not
then lets go talk to her
gittes starts to get out of the car
evelyn grabs his arm nearly screaming no
her intensity actually rips gittes already partially torn jacket
he looks at it and her
it seems to have a momentary calming effect on both of them
continuing shes too upset
i tried to keep it from her i didnt want her upset before i could make plans for her to leave
you mean she just found out
thats not what it looks like mrs
what does it look like
like she knows about hollis death
like she knows more than you want her to tell
just tell me the truth
im not the police
i dont care what youve done
im not going to hurt you but one way or another im going to know
you wont go to the police if i tell you
i will if you dont
a long pause
evelyns head sinks onto the steering wheel her hair covering her face
shes my sister
evelyn is breathing very deeply now
not crying but the kind of deep breathing that comes from real hysteria
gittes puts an arm on her shoulder
take it easy
if its your sister its your sister
why all the secrecy
she lifts her head and looks up at him
hes genuinely puzzled
really upset i cant
because of hollis
because she was seeing your husband
was that it
jesus christ say something
was that it
finally i would never ever have harmed hollis
i loved him more than my own family
he was the most gentle decent man imaginable
and he put up with more from me than youll ever know
i just wanted him to be happy
she begins to cry softly
after a moment i took your husbands buick
he opens the car door ill return it tomorrow
arent you coming back with me
im not telling anybody about this
thats not what i meant
there is a long moment of silence
gittes looks over to evelyn
her hair covers most of her face from him
finally yeah well
im very tired mrs
he gets out and slams the car door
she drives off
the spray is hitting him full on the top of the head
gittes is so exhausted hes literally holding onto the nozzle as the water pours down
he shuts the shower off reaches weakly for a towel dabs his nose lightly with it
pads around in elegant silk pajamas
he walks over to the window where morning light is streaming in
he closes the curtains collapses on the bed on top of the covers inert
almost immediately the phone rings
gittes lets it go on for a moment then picks it up without saying anything
ida sessions wants to see you
ida sessions you remember ida
gittes slowly rises to one elbow
sure you do
well tell you what pal
if ida wants to see me she can call me at my office
he hangs up falls back down
phone rings again
gittes swears picks it up
she begged me to call
shes waiting for you
before gittes can say anything the phone clicks dead
gittes pulls up
it is a bungalow courtyard with a very narrow walkway and sickly green stucco
gittes at the front door
its slightly ajar
he opens it and enters
morning light filters through the half open blinds
dust particles in the shafts of light
its still and empty
gittes sees something down the hall under the legs of a telephone table
gittes moves toward it
it is grotesque
when he gets closer he can see its a wilted head of lettuce
just inside the kitchen some radishes and onions lie on the linoleum
gittes walks on into the kitchen
clearing the kitchen counter gittes sees ida sessions lying on her back on the floor surrounded by the groceries from a broken bag
ice cream has melted around her
her eyes are open a stream of ants is moving across the ice cream and into her mouth
shes recognizable as the woman who posed as evelyn mulwray
gittes kneels over her
he gingerly opens her handbag fishes for its contents takes them and looks at them on the kitchen counter
wallet with a few bills in it drivers license with her name
a screen actors guild card
gittes nods turns carefully replaces the items in the purse
he idly opens the broom closet pantry and even frigidaire which is all but empty
then he steps over her body and moves across the hall to a door that is slightly ajar
gittes enters and turns on the light
find anything interesting gittes
escobar and another plainclothed man stand in the bathroom by the entrance to the bedroom door
gittes turns around
a third man is now coming down the hall from the bedroom
gittes looks at the two doesnt reply
what are you doing here
didnt you call
jerk of his head toward the kitchen how do you happen to know her
turning toward other room let me show you something
escobar points to the number mu on the side of one of the kitchen cabinets
isnt that your number
i dont call myself that often
just to be on the safe side we had loach here give you a ring
he indicates one of his assistants
a slight sneer what happened to your nose gittes
somebody slam a bedroom window on it
right back smiling nope your wife got excited crossed her legs a little too quick
you understand pal
the assistant starts to move for gittes who is ready for him
escobar steps between the two
to other assistant loach
escobar pulls out a drawer how about these
in the open drawer are the photos of mulwray and the girl in the park boat and at the el macando on the veranda
no point in denying it yeah i took em
how did she
meaning the corpse happen to have them
gittes takes a deep breath
either you tell me or i guess cause i dont have the answer
you really think im stupid dont you gittes
i dont think about it one way or the other
but if you want give me a day or two and ill get back to you
now id like to go home
i want the rest of the pictures
meaning the corpse this broad hired you gittes not evelyn mulwray
somebody wanted to shake down mulwray she hired you and thats how you happen to know mulwray was murdered
i heard it was an accident
cmon you think youre dealing with a bunch of assholes
mulwray had salt water in his goddam lungs
now how did he get that
in a fresh water reservoir
gittes is surprised at this piece of information but remains nonplussed
you were following him night and day
you saw who killed him
you even took pictures of it
it was evelyn mulwray
shes been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died
smiling you accusing me of extortion
i dont think i need a day or two
youre even dumber than you think i think you are
not only that id never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy thats where i draw the line escobar
yeah i once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customers face but shed never shit on his chest
thats where she drew the line
smiling well i hope she wasnt too much of a disappointment to you lou
escobar manages a thin smile
i want those photographs gittes
were talking about accessory after the fact conspiracy and extortion
why do you think mulwrays body was moved you dimwit
evelyn mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the oak pass reservoir
this is a little telling
continuing mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didnt want his body found in the ocean
and whys that
he found out somebody was dumping water there
thats what they were trying to cover up by moving him
this stops escobar
hes dumbfounded by it
what are you talking about
cmon ill show you
continuing cmon make a decision lou
youre in charge
the men around escobar look to him
escobar grudgingly nods
it yawns at camera only a trickle of water dropping into the ocean
view widens to include escobar gittes and two plain clothesmen standing and staring at the empty pipe as if they expect it to talk
squinting in sunlight its too late
too late for what
they only dump the water at night
a third assistant runs down the side of the cliff and over to escobar
yelburton hes the new chief
i know who he is
he says i know what he says
to gittes shut up
to assistant go on
yelburton says theyre irrigating in the valley
theres always a little runoff when they do that
and he says is gittes knows that and has been going around making irresponsible accusations for the last week
escobar turns to gittes
stares at him for a long moment
lets swear out a warrant for her arrest
what are we waiting for
meaning escobar because he just made lieutenant and he wants to hang onto his little gold bar
escobar stares hatefully at gittes
have your client in my office in two hours and remember
i dont have to let you go
ive got you for withholding evidence right now
gittes in mulwrays buick whips into the driveway
he looks in the garage
evelyns car is gone
only the gardeners truck is there
gittes hurries along the pathway and up to the house
he rings the doorbell
scarcely waiting for an answer he tries it
he reaches into his pocket pulls out his cigarette case takes a pick out of the side and starts to fool with the lock
the maid opens the door abruptly stares in some surprise at gittes
gittes looks past the maid to the center of the living room where luggage is packed and neatly piled
the maid is actually in the process of throwing covers over the furniture
indicating luggage is mrs
mulwray going someplace
no answer on a trip
no esta in casa
he continues through the house and out back to the veranda
sees the gardener working by the pond
he wanders a few yards in that direction
spots gittes half bows nods and smiles
in turn nods smiles
bad for glass
breaks into a big grin
oh yes bad for glass
he points to the newly mown lawn
continuing salt water velly bad for glass
cant quite believe what hes heard salt water
the gardener nods vigorously
points to the pond
velly velly bad
gittes has moved to the pond
clinging to the edge of it he can now see as he could have before if hed looked closely a starfish
it has one leg missing
the fifth point on the star is just beginning to grow back
touches the water tastes it
he licks his lips then spots something glinting in the bottom of the pond
the gardener peers into the pond
the gardener spots it
he rolls up his trousers gets in the pond and reaches into the bottom his chin actually touching the water
he misses the object which seems to scoot away like an animal
then he grasps it
he lifts it out of the water and holds a pair of eye glasses rimless bent his finger poking through the frame where one lens is shattered
the gardener seems surprised
gittes looks at the glasses
they are heavily bifocal and reflect the sun
gittes holds the phone to his ear
on the telephone table lying on his handkerchief are the glasses
the maid hovers around over gittes shoulder uneasily watching him
have you got your checkbook handy mr
ive got the girl
youve got her
do you remember the figures we discussed
of course i do
where are you

how soon can you get here

gittes hangs up
gittes pulls up in mulwrays buick
he hurries to the front door pounds on it
the chinese servant answers the door
short sentence in chinese you wait
gittes pushes past him
evelyn looking a little worn but glad to see him hurries to the door
she takes gittes arm
how are you
i was calling you
she looks at him searching his face
they move into the living room
gittes is looking around it
did you get some sleep
did you have lunch
kyo will fix you something
abruptly wheres the girl
i want to see her
shes having a bath now
why do you want to see her
gittes continues to look around
he sees clothes laid out for packing in a bedroom off the living room
yes weve got a train to catch
gittes doesnt answer
he goes to the phone and dials
gittes for lieutenant escobar what are you doing
i told you weve got a

then into phone lou meet me at adelaide
its above santa monica canyon
yeah soon as you can
what did you do that for
a moment then you know any good criminal lawyers
i can recommend a couple
theyre expensive but you can afford it
evenly but with great anger what the hell is this all about
gittes looks at her then takes the handkerchief out of his breast pocket
unfolds it on a coffee table revealing the bifocal glasses one lens still intact
evelyn stares dumbly at them
i found these in your backyard
in your fish pond
they belonged to your husband didnt they
i dont know
i mean yes probably
thats where he was drowned
what are you saying
theres no time for you to be shocked by the truth mrs
the coroners report proves he was killed in salt water
just take my word for it
now i want to know how it happened and why
i want to know before escobar gets here because i want to hang onto my license
i dont know what youre talking about
this is the most insane
the craziest thing i ever
gittes has been in a state of near frenzy himself
gets up shakes her
ill make it easy
you were jealous you fought he fell hit his head
it was an accident but his girl is a witness
youve had to pay her off
you dont have the stomach to harm her but youve got the money to shut her up
yes or no
who is she
and dont give me that crap about it being your sister
you dont have a sister
evelyn is trembling
ill tell you the truth
now whats her name
shes my daughter
gittes stares at her
hes been charged with anger and when evelyn says this it explodes
he hits her full in the face
evelyn stares back at him
the blow has forced tears from her eyes but she makes no move not even to defend herself
i said the truth
shes my sister
gittes slaps her again
shes my daughter
gittes slaps her again
he hits her again
my daughter my sister
he belts her finally knocking her into a cheap chinese vase which shatters and she collapses on the sofa sobbing
i said i want the truth
almost screaming it shes my sister and my daughter
kyo comes running down the stairs
continuing in chinese for gods sake kyo keep her upstairs go back
kyo turns after staring at gittes for a moment then goes back upstairs
my father and i understand or is it too tough for you
gittes doesnt answer
he had a breakdown
the dam broke
my mother died
he became a little boy
i was fifteen
hed ask me what to eat for breakfast what clothes to wear
then i ran away
hollis came and took
care of me
after she was born
he took care of her
i couldnt see her
i wanted to but i couldnt
i just want to see her once in a while
take care of her
but i dont want her to know
i dont want her to know
so thats why you hate him
evelyn looks slowly up at gittes
for turning his back on me after it happened
he couldnt face it
weeping i hate him
gittes suddenly feels the need to loosen his tie
where are you taking her now
back to mexico
you cant go by train
escobarll be looking for you everywhere
how about a plane
just get out of here
walk out leave everything
i have to go home and get my things
ill take care of it
where can we go
where does kyo live
on his day off
get the exact address
she stops suddenly
those didnt belong to hollis
for a moment gittes doesnt know what shes talking about
then he follows her gaze to the glasses lying on his handkerchief
how do you know
he didnt wear bifocals
gittes picks up the glasses stares at the lens is momentarily lost in them
from the stairs
she has her arm around katherine
say hello to mr
from the stairs hello
rises a little shakily from the arm of the sofa
with her arm around the girl talking in spanish evelyn hurries her toward the bedroom
in a moment she re emerges
calling down he lives at alameda
do you know where that is
he nods slowly
of bungalow gittes watches evelyn the girl and kyo head for kyos black dusty sedan
gittes drops the curtain heads swiftly to the phone
is walsh there
yeah listen pal escobars going to try and book me in about five minutes
relax ill tell you
wait in the office for two hours
if you dont hear from me you and duffy meet me at alameda
jesus thats in chinatown aint it
the front bell rings
i know where it is
just do it
gittes hangs up and goes to the door
he opens it
no one is there
not even bothering to look around the sides come on in lou
were both too late
escobar and his minions appear from either side of the door
looks like she flew the coop
i dont suppose you got any idea where she went
matter of fact i do
her maids house
i think she knows somethings up
whats the maids address
she lives in pedro
ill write it down for you
no gittes youll show us
if shes not there youre going downtown and youre staying there til she shows up
deliberately petulant gee lou im doing the best i can
shoving him toward the door tell us about it on the way to pedro
a steep hill overlooks part of the harbor
escobars unmarked car pulls up to a stop in front of a spanish duplex perched on the steep hillside
well lets go
do me a favor will you lou
continuing let me bring her down myself
shes not armed or nothing
she wont be any problem
id just like a minute alone with her
it would mean something
and to me
escobar shakes his head
for a moment it looks like it means no
you never learn do you gittes
a little chagrined i guess not
give you three minutes
gee thanks lou
gittes gets out of the car glances around goes up the stairs
he looks back down at escobar
gittes rings the bell
its a woman whos not recognizable
shes got the remnants of a black eye
gittes looks past her to curly the fisherman from the first scene
hes seated at the dinner table with his father his mother and his children
curly looks up in surprise
come in come in
gittes enters and closes the door
curly rises and comes over to him greets him happily
gee this is a surprise mr
call me jake
how is everything
just sitting down to supper jake
care to join us
how about a glass of wine
honey this is
coolly yes i know
thanks just the same curly
i could use a glass of water though
come out with me to the kitchen for a second
puzzled sure thing
curly wheres your car
in the garage
off the alley
could you drive me somewhere
sure as soon as we eat
right now curly
it cant wait
ill just tell my wife
pulling him out the back door tell her later
they head out the back door and down the steps toward the garage
curly pulls open the garage door
gets in starts the car backs it out
its an old late twenties plymouth sedan
gittes hops in
they take off
at the edge of the alley gittes looks back
escobar is getting out of his car moving towards the duplex
gittes slips down in the seat
just drive slow for a block or two will you curly
whats this all about
tell you in a couple of blocks
how much do you owe me curly
embarrassed oh gee mr
gittes were going out tomorrow
i know you been real good about it but my cousin auggies sick
how would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to ensenada
youd have to leave tonight
i dont know
i might be able to squeeze an extra seventy five bucks out of it for you
maybe an even hundred
plus what i owe you
ill throw that in too
smiling okay you got yourself a boat
carry bags out to curlys car
curly opens the door for the maid
she gets in
he turns to gittes
mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there
then if i dont show take her down to the boat
a little worried you sure this is okay
mildly indignant curly you know how long i been in business
curly nods reassured
he gets in and takes off
by the pond cigarette smoke drifts into shot
a car pulls up
in a moment cross can be seen looking toward camera
there you are
he walks toward gittes who stands by the pond smoking
continuing well you dont look any the worse for wear mr
gittes i must say
wheres the girl
ive got her
is she all right
where is she
with her mother
cross tone alters here
with her mother
gittes pulls something out of his pocket and unfolds it
id like you to look at something mr
taking it what is it
an obituary column
can you read in this light
i think i can manage
cross dips into his coat pocket and pulls out a pair of rimless glasses
he puts them on reads
stares at the bifocal lenses as cross continues to look through the obituary column
he looks up
what does this mean
that you killed hollis mulwray
gittes is holding the bifocals with the broken lens now
right here in this pond
you drowned him
and you left these
cross looks at the glasses
the coroners report showed mulwray had salt water in his lungs
finally hollie was always fond of tide pools
you know what he used to say about them
havent the faintest idea
thats where life begins
marshes sloughs tide pools
he was fascinated by them
you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there instead of
evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs
youd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty
he made this city
and thats what you were going to do in the valley
after a long moment no mr
thats what i am doing with the valley
the bond issue passes tuesday
therell be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir
im doing it
theres going to be some irate citizens when they find out theyre paying for water theyre not getting
thats all taken care of
you see mr
either you bring the water to l
or you bring l
to the water
how do you do that
just incorporate the valley into the city so the water goes to l
its very simple
then how much are you worth
shrugs then i have no idea
how much do you want
i want to know what youre worth
over ten million
oh my yes
then why are you doing it
how much better can you eat
what can you buy that you cant already afford
a long moment then the future mr
now wheres the girl
i want the only daughter i have left
as you found out evelyn was lost to me a long time ago
with sarcasm who do you blame for that
cross makes a funny little cock of his head
i dont blame myself
you see mr
gittes most people never have to face the fact that at the right time and right place theyre capable of anything
take those glasses from him will you claude
mulvihill moves into view
extends his hand for the glasses
gittes doesnt move
its not worth it mr
its really not worth it
gittes hands over the glasses
take us to the girl
either evelyn allows me to see her or im not averse to seeing evelyn in jail
if i have to buy the jail
hollis and evelyn kept her from me for fifteen years
its been too long im too old
the streets are crowded
here and there one can see chinese in traditional dress
driving slowly spots katherine with ramon and luggage nearly lost in the crowd
they are walking toward a car parked near a laundry truck
gittes sees them keeps driving
suddenly stop the car
stop the car
mulvihill tries to clobber gittes
gittes elbows him
the car jumps the curb and hits a lamppost
leaps out of the car shouting katherine
gittes is after him grabbing him
cross tries to swing at gittes with his cane
mulvihill comes up behind gittes and the three of them begin an awkward wrestling match the crowd scattering mulvihill pulling his revolver trying to hit gittes on the side of
the three men crash to the pavement
starts out of the car toward gittes
gittes sees him
no curly get em out of here
get em out of here
he bites mulvihills hand and furiously pounds it into the sidewalk shaking gun loose
mulvihill and gittes try for it but someone else has it
holds the gun
shes shaking but apparently in control of herself
rises to his feet
mulvihill starts to help cross up
no dont help him
dont do anything
mulvihill doesnt move
cross rises on his own
evelyn holds the revolver on him
its no good
moving to evelyn let me handle that
to gittes im all right
shes not sure but id like to handle it
evelyn backs up as her father takes a step toward her
youre going to have to kill me evelyn
either that or tell me where she is
evelyn is backing up
cross moving on her
evelyn cocks the pistol
how many years have i got
shes mine too
shes never going to know that
theres the sound of a siren
cross lunges toward her
gittes grabs cross
duffy and walsh are elbowing through the crowd
gittes sees them
duffy go over and sit on mulvihill
to walsh jesus christ i didnt tell you to bring the police department with you
jake its chinatown
theyre all over the place
you oughta know better
to walsh meaning cross gimme your keys

moving to evelyn take duffys car
curlys boats in pedro near the starkist cannery
its the evening star
hell be waiting
ill take care of this
she looks to gittes
he looks at her
she turns and he looks at her
she turns and escobar is standing between her and it
mulwray you dont want to run around like that
escobar you dont know whats going on
let her go
ill explain it later
mulwray its a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law
its a felony

starting toward her im sorry mrs

gittes stay outta this
escobar continues to move toward her
gittes grabs him
to evelyn now take off
evelyn gets in the car
she starts it
gittes lets escobar go
ill just have her followed
shes not going anywhere
theres a single gunshot
both men look surprised
down the block a uniformed officer has fired standing beside his double parked car
duffys sedan slows to a stop in the middle of the street
it jerks a couple of times still in gear then comes to a halt
gittes rushes to the car
he opens it
evelyn falls out inert
blood is pouring from her right eye
he holds onto evelyn as escobar and others hurry up
cross himself elbows through
where is he
ill kill him ill kill the son of a bitch
several officers contain gittes
to escobar who is he get his name
ill kill him
badly shaken take it easy take it easy it was an accident
gittes looks down
what he sees horrifies him
cross is on the ground holding evelyns body crying
get him away from her
hes responsible for everything
get him away from her
stunned jake youre very disturbed
thats her father
walsh and duffy elbow through the crowd
to them you wanna do your partner the biggest favor of his life
take him home
just get him the hell out of here
duffy bear hugs the protesting gittes along with walsh literally dragging him away from the scene with gittes trying to shake free
through the crowd noises walsh can be heard saying forget it jake
