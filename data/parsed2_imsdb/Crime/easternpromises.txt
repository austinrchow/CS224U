written by steven knight its
pm in late december and rain is pouring
the scant christmas decorations are hanging limp in the rain
a young turk ekrem runs through the rain with a turkish newspaper held over his head
he ducks into a traditional barbers shop called ozims
the shutters are drawn
ozim a plump middle aged turk is cutting the hair of the last customer of the day soyka
soyka is a chechen well groomed wearing a sharp suit beneath the barbers gown
during the conversation we glimpse distinctive eagle and star shaped tattoos on soykas arms and hands
ozim and soyka are chatting as ekrem enters
soyka speaks with a russian accent
bloody kids you know
he says but amca its christmas
oi how much are you taking off
so i said to him
the kids sixteen
ozim brushes some hair off the customers shoulder and ozim finally acknowledges ekrem who is shivering and wet near to the door
ekrem turns the open sign to closed
they dont want to work do they
hesitantly interrupting uncle ozim
we see for the first time that ekrem is shaking with fear as well as cold
this is him
the kid im talking about
ekrem approaches stiffened by terror
soyka nods at ekrem in the mirror
he looks ok to me
how you doin ekrem
soyka offers ekrem a hand to shake and ekrem stares at it as if it were enchanted
he looks ok yeah but he wont do one lousy thing for me
ekrem take this
ozim takes an open razor from behind a line of hair tonic bottles and hands it to ekrem who now looks mortally terrified
we had a deal now hes backing out
laughing hey ozim leave the kid alone
its obviously a psychological thing
take it ekrem
ozim its ok
i dont want a shave
this is the kid who walks around like al capone
take the fucking ustura and finish this rushca
soyka rises up from the seat casting off his barbers gown
ozim yells kabuka
and ekrem snarls flicks open the razor and drags it across soykas throat
soykas scream bubbles in the blood
we dissolve to a christmas decoration flashing on and off in the rain high on a lamp post in kilburn high road
we pan down the lamp post to the high road where revelers are hurrying through the rain
we see a young girl tatiana hurrying across the street wrapped in a dressing gown with a mans overcoat thrown over the top of it
her hair is soaked as she approaches an all night chemists shop
she is barefoot
the chemist is delivering advice in gujurati to a customer
tatiana wipes rain from her face and the chemist and the customer react to her ragged appearance
russian accent please
for methadone i need to see paper prescription
the customer looks at tatianas feet and reacts
we see blood trickling down her legs
tatiana looks down then faints onto the floor
we see tatiana unconscious on a wheeled trolley bursting through double doors into the operating ward of trafalgar hospital
the trolley is accompanied by two nurses a junior doctor and a midwife anna khitrova
the two paramedics who brought her are following behind the trolley
did you get a name
a tiny brown handbag is being shaken empty by a nurse
tatiana is being prepared for an emergency caesarean
the theater is full of people in scrubs including an anesthetist
monitors and drips are being attached at double speed
we notice that her arms are already dotted with festering needle marks
a nurse searches through the contents of the handbag and we can hear frantic activity from the operating table
her stats are very poor very poor
babys very distressed
anna approaches the nurse who is rummaging through the contents of the bag
we see a business card from a restaurant called the trans siberian a st
christopher necklace and a tiny battered diary
anna grabs the diary
shoulder distocia i think
stuck on the pubic bone
cut to anna at tatianas head
anna strokes her face and speaks softly
darling can you hear me
babys heart beat sixty
fifty eight fifty eight
anna im trying to rotate the shoulder medially
the junior doctor is breathing hard with a look of utter panic as he attempts to free the baby
the doors burst open and a more senior doctor in his mid thirties doctor aziz enters at a gallop
as he enters
baby stats sixty eight and in free fall
im not getting a pulse
doctor aziz joins the junior doctor who looks out of his depth
speak to me
before the junior doctor can speak anna speaks directly to aziz
softly we need to get the baby out now
aziz knows he can take annas word
ok lets go
all hell is let loose
as the caesarean process begins at frantic speed we slowly zoom in on tatianas unconscious face and hear her voice in v
a young girls voice speaking with an russian accent
the crosstalk between nurses and doctors becomes more and more frantic
my name is tatiana
my father died in the mines in my village so he was already buried when he died
we were all buried there
buried under the soil of russia
that is why i left to find a better life
a baby cry
annas face appears in our framed shot of tatianas face
she gently kisses tatianas cheek
whispers you had a girl
a sheet is pulled over tatianas face
a nurse weighs the screaming baby
anna wipes her brow with the back of her bloody wrist
the junior doctor and a nurse check watches and speak almost in unison
unidentified woman died december th at
baby girl born december th at
anna leaves the labor ward putting on her crash helmet
she emerges out into the crisp sunny morning
aziz hurries to catch her up and hands her a wrapped gift
merry christmas anna
oh dont be ridiculous
and you have to open it in front of me
aziz smiles as anna unwraps a pair of leather motorcycling gloves
she looks up at him expressionless
at least pretend
anna considers the gloves
deadpan in the whole entire history of my life i have never felt this special
aziz plants a kiss on his two fingers and presses his fingers against annas cheek through the open visor of the helmet
anna rides her big vintage ural motorcycle through deserted morning streets
as she rides we hear tatiana in v
i am so excited this morning
yesterday a friend came back to our village and he told us all about the places on the map that i look at
paris amsterdam london
hes been there for real
after the bright airiness of the bike ride we are suddenly in annas bedroom where the curtains are drawn
anna is lying awake on the bed wearing a dressing gown
he said the future of everything was already happening in all those places
there is a gentle knock at the door which opens before anna can respond
it is annas mother helen with a cup of tea
did you sleep
theres no point us tiptoeing around if youre not even sleeping
helen puts the tea on the dressing table then turns to leave without a smile
are you ok
contrite of course not
anna is pouring two glasses of sherry
helen is peeling potatoes
anna peers at helen
and sees tears
they share a moment of stifled emotion
helen wipes her eyes with her sleeve
its the chicken
pause the smell of chicken roasting reminds me of him
you should have done beef then
they look at each other and giggle
they both have potato peelers in their wet hands sleeves rolled up two practical unsentimental women being almost consumed by the same wave of emotion
it wouldnt be christmas without tears in the gravy would it
we hear a gruff russian voice calling out from the living room uncle stepan
where did you get this
anna and helen roll their eyes
whispering its your own fault for giving him something to play with
irritated well i cant read russian can i
anna drops her peeler and hurries into the living room
the living room table is laid for dinner
uncle stepan is early seventies russian
he is reading the tiny diary that anna found in tatianas bag
anna breezes in
i told you uncle stepan i found it in the handbag of a girl who died in my ward
do you always rob the bodies of the dead
suppressed familiar anger of course we all do it
its one of the perks of working in a hospital
stepan grumbles accustomed to this teasing
helen enters carrying a bowl of walnuts and brazil nuts which she places on the table
stepan looks pointedly at helen
did you know that your daughter robs the bodies of the dead
stepan is there an address
stepan lays the diary aside obstinate and prim
you have an uncle who doesnt steal things from the dead
not even their secrets
oh dont go all momentous on us stepan
she straightens the table cloth lift your elbows
you should put this in her coffin anna
bury her secrets with her bodies
stepan leaves in a huff
anna picks up the diary and begins to study it
she sees the trans siberian business card between the pages
how long will dinner be
helen looks at anna suspecting an attempt to escape
driving music as we see anna riding her motorbike through deserted morning streets again
we should begin to sense that this is a kind of release for her
we hear tatiana in v
when i was little london was like a place in the bible
i wasnt even sure if it was real
my friend has told me there is a place in london where they pay girls to sing
anna arrives outside the trans siberian restaurant
it has a russian themed frontage in blue and gold expensively and recently finished
he said if i sang in this restaurant i would make more money in a week than my father made in a year
as anna pulls up we hear a dog begin to bark
the side door opens to reveal a hard looking handsome russian man nikolai who stops to groom his hair back from his face and put on a pair of sunglasses
as he emerges into daylight
he steps into a small courtyard where a fierce doberman dog is barking and snarling on the end of a chain
nikolai is followed by kirill who is a little younger slim and pretty but hard looking too
kirill is dressed in a crumpled t shirt and jeans and looks like he had a heavy night
nikolai ignores the dog as he walks by but kirill yells at it and teases it with a whoop and few russian curses
nikolai unbolts the gate to the street
so you pick up ozim and his bitch of a wife and you bring them back here
he glances back at the restaurant and speaks softly
then ill think of an excuse and we can get away
ill think of an excuse
your excuses are like fucking fairy tales
kirill grins and nikolai flicks the fob of his car keys
the lights on an expensive black mercedes glow in response
kirill notices anna locking up her bike at the front of the restaurant
who the fucks that
they both see anna removing her crash helmet and shaking out her hair
she walks towards the front door
in russian maybe somebody sent your dad a hooker for christmas
grinning youre so
fucking unbelievably disrespectful
kirill sees that nikolai is studying anna and his grin fades
we sense jealousy
hey youve got work to do
kirill grabs nikolais face to distract him gives him a playful slap but there is somehow more to it than playfulness
nikolai gets into his car
kirill glares at anna as she approaches the front of the restaurant
as nikolai drives away anna rings the doorbell beside the front door
there is no reply
she is about to ring again when the door opens
we see semyon a russian man in his late sixties
he is wiping his hands on a tea towel dressed in a spotlessly white apron
he has the sparkling piercing eyes of a falcon
we are closed
she fumbles in her bag
im a midwife
anna produces her hospital id and shows it to semyon
with a twinkle then unless one of my daughters is keeping something from me you have the wrong address
id like to speak to the manager
semyon studies the name on the id
my dad was russian
semyon seems suddenly delighted
and his name
so you are anna ivanovna
the tables are set for a huge party
kirill is now on step ladders fixing some christmas decorations
other relatives are getting the place ready
semyon hurries through the restaurant leading anna by the hand
we must hurry
i must stir
stir stir or the gravy dies in my hands
today it is family
here is my son kirill
he hisses at kirill kirill
the berries are too low too low
and roman more glasses for red
he claps his hands come on
kirill follows annas progress through the restaurant with a glare
blue revision a
there are three little girls in extravagant party frocks all holding violins and giggling near to the door that blue revision
leads to the kitchen
semyon stops when he reaches them and puts his hands on his hips
you should be practising
you must make the wood cry
like this like this
semyon grabs a violin and plays a three second burst of sad russian violin music
semyon hurries on into the kitchen
anna smiles delighted at the eccentric old man
inside the kitchen there is an inferno of activity steam smoke
family members some dressed in their party outfits others in chefs uniforms are standing over steaming pots laughing arguing
children play and yell
you can almost smell christmas
anna enters dazzled by it all overwhelmed by the contrast to her own lifeless christmas kitchen
semyon calls out to everyone
come come hurry hurry
they will be here any moment
to anna ok show me this card
anna reaches into her pocket and produces the trans siberian business card she found in tatianas bag
semyon angles his head to look as he stirs
it is the old card
from before the renovations
but even so if she had worked here i would remember the name
perhaps she ate here once
semyon offers anna a spoonful of his gravy
she sips it
god thats amazing
my dad made gravy just like that
semyon shrugs and smiles his eyes twinkling then goes back to stirring
he speaks as if unconcerned
so did you get a chance to talk to this girl before she died
nikolais black mercedes pulls up outside the restaurant and parks a few inches from annas motorbike
the rear windows are sun shaded so we only see nikolai in the drivers seat
he gets out of the car and opens the rear door of the car for an elegantly dressed turkish lady in her fifties
nikolai goes to the other rear door
the portly figure of ozim the barber emerges
as ozim gets out he gives nikolai a fifty pound note
two of the little girl violinists are fighting pulling each others hair
the third is sobbing sitting on the floor
a young woman in a party dress is carrying a huge silver bowl of sauce across the kitchen
anna looks delighted at the noise and energy of the place
finally semyon emerges from a cloud of steam with a scrap of paper
this is an agency that hires casual kitchen staff
maybe you will have more luck there
but i think they will be closed until new year
as anna takes the address kirill puts his head around the door and yells through the noise
papa ozim is here
semyon is alarmed and claps his hand in urgent fashion
to the rest of the kitchen fish fish fish
ok kirill get him a drink and tell him i am coming
semyon takes a pot from the heat suddenly flustered
anna im so sorry i couldnt help
it is sad
ill probably find out more when i get her diary translated
there is the tiniest of changes in semyons manner
he lays his heavy pot down
i found her diary in her bag
semyon disappears into a billow of steam to put a pan onto the heat then re emerges
why did you not tell me you found a diary
he peers at her for a moment his eyes hardening a little
ok anna this is how it will be
you will bring the diary here and i will translate it for you
then if we get the names of any relatives i will call them myself
i am something of a
community leader for the russians here in this unfriendly city
what do you say
semyon hoists a passing child into his arms
i was going to ask my uncle
apparently not hearing and when you come i will make you some more gravy like your papa used to make and you can try the blue revision
fish with the sauce
shall we say seven
anna is a little overwhelmed
then it is settled
but for now you must forgive me
semyon shrugs then kisses anna on both cheeks
anna heads for the door that leads back to the restaurant
semyon goes back to stirring but as he stirs he calls out
oh anna you always work at the trafalgar hospital
a pause before anna leaves semyon to his clouds of steam
kirill and ozim are talking confidentially in a mix of russian and turkish whispers at a table
ozims wife is at a table alone well out of their earshot smoking a cigarette and peeling glazed figs
as anna walks by ozim and kirill stop talking
the scene has a much darker mood to the bustling scene in the kitchen but for now anna feels no unease
as she passes kirill surveys her with a deadly smile and a professional eye
hey you ok
you want a drink
as anna smiles ozim mumbles something in turkish and kirill shushes him
anna emerges into the daylight
as she does she sees that four expensive looking cars have already parked and various ostentatiously dressed russian and turkish couples with their children are emerging from their cars
the women are all wearing furs even the little girls
the men wear leather or dark suits
they greet each other exuberantly as they emerge from their cars
anna suddenly feels slightly uneasy
as she approaches her motorbike she sees nikolai leaning against the bonnet of his car smoking still wearing shades
his bumper is almost touching annas bike
in russian nice bike
you dont see them anymore
it was my dads
how much do you want for it
anna has already taken a dislike to this man
he is arrogant and looks potentially violent
his shades suit and tattoos say it all
irritated it has sentimental value
nikolai rolls the concept around in his mind and considers
pink revision a
ive heard of that
anna puts her helmet on
youre not staying for the party
chauffeurs dont get invited
you want to go for a drink instead
anna mounts her bike
sometimes if things are closed you just open them up you know
anna now feels intimidated and luckily the bike fires first time
she rides away
nikolai watches her go and then stubs his cigarette
perhaps the ticking of a clock
this is annas christmas dinner a total contrast to the chaos of the restaurant
stepan is attempting to carve the chicken
anna how come is it that your boyfriend isnt here to carve
stepan takes a large sip of vodka
i dont live with oliver any more uncle stepan
im living back here for a bit
softly for as long as you want
i knew he would run away from you
he didnt run away
you make me sound like a burning building
black men always run away
i am allowed to be honest
he was a doctor stepan
what the hell has that got to do with it
stepan sips his vodka
it is not natural to mix race and race
that is why your baby died inside you
anna slams her napkin onto the table
stepan shut up
anna gets to her feet please anna
helen takes annas hand but she turns and leaves
helen stands to follow her but first she whips stepans vodka away from him
youre just how he was
stupid bloody drunken russians
the garden is just outside the kitchen
anna is lighting a cigarette
helen steps outside and reacts to the cigarette
she is about to admonish anna for smoking but anna speaks first
im thirty one
anna blows smoke clearly upset
anna you know what hes like
i dont give a damn about stepan
who has that poor baby got in the whole world
i knew this would happen
so you know everything
anna she isnt your responsibility
the baby is my responsibility until i hand her over to the mother
the mother is dead
then its up to the proper authorities
anna smiles as if in agreement
the proper authorities will all be skiing until after new year
anna coughs a little then stubs her cigarette
helen takes the butt as if it were poisonous
its part of the grieving
helen touches her hand
an inadequate gesture
in the last year youve lost your father and you lost a baby
anna is irritated but doesnt put words to her feelings
come in and have your dinner
im not hungry
anna and helen look into each others eyes for a moment before helen heads for the kitchen carrying the cigarette butt as if it were a deadly snake
in a private room in the special care baby unit anna approaches tatianas babys plastic crib
the baby is tightly bundled up sound asleep
through the windows of the room we see the darkened quiet ward outside another world
anna stands over the baby her face full of emotion
there we see pain loss shame emptiness isolation
tears begin to roll from her eyes and then she is sobbing soundlessly
the trans siberian restaurant is smoky with cigarettes and cigars
the party is in full swing with two dozen guests and family
one of the golden haired children is playing violin badly
the language is russian english and turkish mixed
kirill is bringing a huge baked carp to the table
his mobile phone rings and he wipes his hands on a towel to answer it
when he hears the voice kirill glances at his father and moves quickly out of earshot
semyon notices but hides his concern
as kirill walks a child tugs his leg and holds up a soft toy asking a question in russian
to child hes called goofy
into phone so the coast is clear yeah
i said coast
goldenrod revision a
pause no not the beach
its an english expression you fucking baboon
hissing out of ear shot there are no police
kirill glances over at semyon who is apparently lost amongst a sea of children but we see from the corner of his eye he is watching kirill
to phone no my dads not involved
im a big boy now
i do my own stuff
kirill cuts the call and nods to ozim who stubs his cigar
semyon notices their silent communication then turns to one of the violin playing angels smiles and kisses her on both cheeks
we see the car pull up sharply outside ozims barbers shop
nikolai jumps out and opens the door for ozim
the three men walk to the door beside the barber shop
ozim takes a bunch of keys out and prepares to open the door to the upstairs
the driver stays down here
kirill smiles and shakes his head
you really think i do this kind of thing
kirill puts his hand on nikolais shoulder this guys not a driver
hes an undertaker
ozim looks at nikolai highly dubious
the rooms above ozims shop have been converted into a drinking club
ozim leads nikolai and kirill through the debris of the night before
as they walk through ekrem suddenly leaps out of the darkness with a yell
kirill and nikolai both react with instinctive aggression
hey hey hey ekrem sakim durgun durgun
i got tickets ozim
its with chelsea
they said there was no tickets but i got tickets for the chelsea game
ok ok ok
you go and watch a dvd yeah
ekrem nods and hugs ozim
we realize he is slightly deranged
finally he lets ozim go and leaves
kirill watches him go
he knows to say he hasnt seen us right ozim
ozim finds the key to the kitchen
he dont know anything
hes touched by the angels
ozim opens the kitchen door
inside the kitchen there are carcasses of lambs hanging from meat hooks
there are knives and skewers around the place
ozim stops and locks the kitchen door behind them
the freezer door opens and ozim gestures towards a large package bound up in black bin liners which are dusted with frost
kirill nods to nikolai who grabs the package and hauls it out onto the kitchen floor
kirill tears a hole in the bin liner and we see the frost dusted face of soyka
kirill studies the face and nods
kirill crosses himself
there was a time when he was like a brother to me
he puts his hand on his heart with mock solemnity
now he looks like a fucking ice cream
softly hey hey show some respect for a dead man
this is respect
kirill reaches into his pocket and produces an envelope which he hands to ozim
as ozim opens the envelope and begins to count the huge wad of cash kirill turns to nikolai
ok nikolai hes all yours
and show some respect
this muslim is scared of ghosts
nikolai squeezes the body inside the bags
it is rock hard
have you got a hair dryer
we cut close to an ancient looking hair dryer from the shop downstairs being trained onto a human hand with a large eagle tattoo
we pull wide to reveal the full gruesome scene
nikolai has the body of soyka laid out on a surface his head still bound up in a bin bag his lower portions bound up similarly
nikolai is de frosting soykas left hand with the hair dryer concentrating on his ring finger which has a gold ring on it
the parts of soykas shirt and jacket which are visible are crusted with frozen blood
nikolai is wearing rubber gloves
as he dries nikolai takes a sip of coffee
ozim is watching this scene with horror
kirill has his arms folded mightily impressed
finally the hand is thawed enough for nikolai to remove the gold ring
he studies an inscription and then offers it to ozim
ozim shakes his head as if the thing were a contagion
nikolai shrugs and pockets it
he then turns the hair dryer back on and blows some hot air onto the crisply bloody chest of soyka
he tugs at the frozen lapel of the jacket and blows air into the inside pocket
within a few moments he is able to remove soykas glistening thawing wallet which is caked in frozen blood
he opens it we glimpse a photo of a wife and children and blows hot air onto the money inside
he tugs a wad of frozen bank notes from the wallet all stuck together by drops of frozen blood
he offers this money to ozim as well but ozim shakes his head vigorously
kirill hoots with laughter
ozim is now staring at nikolai as if he were a devil from hell
nikolai grabs a plastic bag and puts the money inside it then pockets the frozen wad
he tosses the rest of the frozen wallet to ozim who instinctively catches it
youd better burn that
ozim reacting to the cold of the wallet and to the horror of it drops the thing on the floor
nikolai looks at ozim as if he were a complete amateur
did you finish cutting his hair
ozim cant answer
i just thought you might want six fifty out of his pockets
nikolai takes a deep breath to prepare himself
ok now im going to do his teeth and cut off his fingers
to ozim you might want to leave the room
ozim thinks decides leaves fast
you too kirill
kirill smiles and pats nikolai on the cheek
nikolai is left alone
his hand shakes a little as he picks up his cup of coffee
nikolai pulls up beside a rusting crane on the abandoned dock in a dry cleaners van
kirill watches as nikolai grabs the semi thawed body now bagged and tied lifts it onto his shoulder and smartly approaches the dockside
arent you going to weight him down or something
nikolai drops the body into the water with a splash
if you want to dump a body this is the place
the currents keep it under the surface until past the barrier
nikolai and kirill watch as the body is swallowed by a fast ocean bound current
anna pulls up at some lights on her motorbike
my friend said he would get me to amsterdam and from there we could find a way into london
i have been practising my singing and blue revision
have even rejoined the church choir
i am also practising my english
semyon sits alone at the dinner table in the restaurant where before there was family and uproar
outside its dark and raining
he is reading a russian crime novel
a half empty bottle of vodka sits on the table
tatianas voice over continues as we cut inside the restaurant
my friend says his uncle owns the restaurant where you can sing
he is sure this man will take care of me
there is a knock at the door and semyon looks up sharply
his eyes glisten
he puts his novel aside
semyon is unlocking the door and discovering in the drizzle and half light that it is anna
i wasnt expecting you so early
is it ok
semyon and anna are sitting down at the candlelit table
anna fumbles in her bag and produces a sheaf of photocopied sheets
she has photocopied the pages of the diary and they are laid out in segments on each page
i copied the whole thing
semyon takes the pages and looks troubled
where is the original
im going to keep it
maybe give it to tatianas daughter someday
semyon looks thwarted but hides it well
he studies the photocopied sheets for a while then looks up and smiles
i will need my spectacles and a clear head
today i broke my rules and drank vodka
tomorrow i will translate it
he folds the papers carefully
then i will bring what i have done to your home
where do you live anna
there is nothing in semyons smile to cause alarm but anna perhaps remembers nikolai
i can drop by and pick it up
then maybe i can drive you home
im on my motorbike
semyon stares at her for a moment
so what will happen to the poor child
after christmas theyll do a missing persons report
semyon doesnt blink
at that moment a little girl of seven maria emerges from the darkness carrying a soft toy
hey hey maria go back to bed
im too sad
next christmas isnt for another hundreds and hundreds of days
semyon takes her onto his knee
as he does we see for the first time an eagle tattoo on his wrist
but you have had so many presents
the girl wafts semyons cigar smoke
you shouldnt smoke grandpa
semyon cuddles maria and stubs his cigar
anna smiles at the warm family scene perhaps remembering her own father
nikolai gets out of the mercedes and helps an extremely pissed kirill out of the car into the rain
kirill is so drunk he slips through nikolais hands and lands in the gutter
were partners now man you know
yeah yeah i know
nikolai manages to lift him to his feet again
as they head towards the restaurant anna emerges
nikolai looks up curious as semyon kisses her on both cheeks in the doorway
as she turns kirill stumbles forwards and collapses in front of her
nikolai looks up at anna his face splashed with rain
you never seen anybody pissed before
semyon looks down at the drunken kirill and slams the door of the restaurant
nikolai sighs then turns to kirill and starts to go through his pockets
come on kirill
where are your keys
anna walks around the two of them watching the undignified struggle as nikolai finds kirills keys
nikolai smiles at her
who are you anyway
anna hurries away into the rain
nikolai finds kirills keys and drags him toward the door of the restaurant
nikolai heaves kirill into a chair
semyon is back at his novel and watches as kirill attempts to get to his feet and then stumbles to the floor
he slumps down now totally unconscious breathing deeply
we went to a kurdish place
they dont even celebrate christmas
semyon steps up to where kirill is lying and stands over him for a moment
then he kicks him hard in the guts with all his might
nikolai is shocked and grabs semyons arm
a hand laid upon him is like deadly poison
kirill grunts and moans
hey papa what did i do
this is merry christmas or what
semyon kicks him hard in the guts again
i think hes had enough
nikolai steps in between semyon and kirill
semyon is shocked that anyone should face him like this
are you to tell me enough
nikolais face hardens
nikolai looks down at kirill
hes thunder im lightning
he makes all the noise i do all the damage
i hired you as a driver
semyon bends to roughly hoist kirill into a chair
someone to stop him killing himself
well you got more than a driver
nikolai reaches into his pocket for a business card and offers it to semyon
as semyon looks at the card in the candle light he also sees the tattoo of an eagle on nikolais hand
it is obvious that the tattoo means more than the card to semyon and he reacts
i run a mini cab business
albanians chechens russians
they deliver packages
i only took this job so that i could get to meet you
in russian i think you and i could do business together
semyon looks at nikolai with utter contempt
i have no idea what business youre talking about
now get out
nikolai smiles and then leaves
semyon watches him go then peers at his drunken sleeping son with something approaching compassion
nikolai hurries out to his car in the rain
he hears an engine splutter and spots anna still trying to kick start her motorbike
shes already soaked
nikolai watches her try to start the bike and fail
youve got water in it
deadpan anna looks up and holds out her hand into pouring rain
what makes you think that
anna tries to start the bike again
the postmen used these
in my village
when i was a boy
russian copy of bmw flat twin
anna tries one more time to start the bike and growls with fury
nikolai gently takes her shoulders and after a brief resistance anna climbs off the bike
nikolai sits astride it
he kicks it
it fails to start
anna folds her arms
pink revision a
he tries again
he climbs off
get a bus
anna curses under her breath
nikolai isnt sure what to make of her
she begins to chain the bikes rear wheel
you got far to go
anna tucks her crash helmet under her arm and prepares to set off walking
just across the park
im a driver
i even do limousines
nikolai opens the rear car door
if semyon found out i let one of his guests walk home in the rain hed fire me
and i can take care of your bike
nikolai holds open the rear car door
nikolai is driving anna through the rain swept streets
the wipers beat time as they drive in silence
as nikolai holds the steering wheel anna sees the intricate detail of the eagle tattoo on the back of his right hand
so youre a midwife
anna smiles politely
whats it like
you get used to it
nikolai seems vaguely horrified at a memory
i didnt faint but it was close
how many have you got
nikolai half shrugs
what you dont know
yeah i know i know its just
it makes me upset you know
thinking about it
this time of year
theyre back in yekaterinburg
in the forests
near the mountains
a long pause
so semyon employs you
sort of freelance
you said hed fire you
nikolai doesnt answer
anna decides she can be bold
did you ever meet a girl called tatiana
i meet lots of girls called tatiana
she was pregnant
in that case no i never heard of her
anna doesnt care for the smile on nikolais face
she died last night on my shift
i thought you did birth
sometimes birth and death go together
pause she had needle punctures all over both arms
early presentation of syphilis
probably a prostitute
at the age of fourteen
quickly without a pause you know what
i hate the rain
this time of year
you ever been to russia at christmas
man snow that covers your whole house
nikolai glances at anna in the rear view mirror
and the ice
whole lakes covered in ice
you dont want to walk across them though
ice gets thin where you least expect it
you think semyons son knew her
like i said im a driver
i go left i go right i go straight ahead
anna nods her curiosity and suspicions aroused
nikolai glances at her
just here is great
nikolai pulls over and anna opens her door to escape
how much do i owe you
nikolai watches her hurry to her front door and let herself in
somewhere within sight of the thames barrier
a dozen policemen and forensic investigators are milling round on a shale beach the icy waters of the thames lapping at their feet
a large tent has been erected over the body of soyka
inside the tent two senior police officers await the arrival of a third man a specialist from the russian desk yuri who is not dressed for the weather
he has obviously been dragged out of bed
he is led to the side of the body
one of the officers pulls up the dead mans hand and shows him the eagle tattoo
we think he might be russian mafia
yuri studies the tattoo then borrows a torch
he crouches to push up the wet trouser leg on the corpses right leg
when the knee is exposed in torch light we see a small star tattooed on the knee cap
he is actually a chechen
he is also a member of the vory v zakone
the stars on the knees mean he would never kneel before anyone
yuri opens the dead mans shirt and we see a tattoo of an eight pointed star on his chest
in russian prisons your life story is written on your body in tattoos
you dont exist without tattoos
pause he was a captain
pink revision a
he then checks out the fingers in the torchlight and we glimpse that the finger tips have been sawn off
pink revision b
but he has been processed professionally
yuri straightens and grabs a paper towel to wipe his hands
there was something else
inside the body
the officer holds up a small zip lock bag which has a handwritten note sealed inside it
the handwriting is just visible through the wet cellophane
yuri steps outside the forensic tent
he opens the bag and takes out the note
he unfolds it to read then smiles to himself
anna is drying her hair looking at herself in the mirror
she turns off the dryer
there is a knock on the door
helen enters looking anxious
we see stepan hovering in the background
stepan come here
tell her what you told me
stepan stands primly in the doorway strangely defiant
pause stepan what
im late for work
he shakes his head angrily
finally from behind his back he produces tatianas diary
who gave you that
it was on the dresser
mum you cant go through my things
pink revision a
you wanted him to translate it
anna gets up to grab the diary
and he said he wouldnt do it so ive found somebody else
you dont go to someone else with this
you dont go to anyone
nasilovanie it means rape
iglah it means needle
prostitutcia perhaps you can guess
stepan hands the diary to anna and then turns
i go to wash my hands
anna and helen are left in awkward silence
anna buries the diary in her dressing table drawer
helen looks at her with anxiety
anna stepan said this girl ended up in the hands of the vory v zakone
do you know what that means
just because im back in this room doesnt mean im twelve again
you never listened to me even then
look if i dont find a relative in the next few days theyll put christine out for fostering
once shes in the system shell never get out again
who named her christine
i had to call her something
it sounds like christmas
pause shes very beautiful
helen is now deeply concerned
if i can persuade stepan to translate it will you leave the rest to the police
anna looks at helen then digs out the diary and hands it to her
tell him ive heard bad words before
helen is about to leave
she stops in the doorway
your father used to say the vory are a contagious disease
theres no cure once theyve touched you
momma this is london
we are in harlesden north london
a large portable stereo is playing rock music
the curtains are drawn against daylight
the living room is decorated in seventies suburban style but with the wall paper peeling and the paint work fading
kitsch paintings still decorate the walls
six young east european girls are sitting on a broken down sofa and on hard backed chairs wearing short skirts
their eyes are sunken and their faces vacant of expression but they are painted with so much make up they almost look like tiny sad clowns
they sit in silence as the music blares out
after a few moments a young albanian man enters and claps his hands
ok boss is here
you make him happy
all the girls apart from one immediately get to their feet and begin to dance to the music their bodies moving awkwardly and painfully
the albanian approaches the one girl who refused to stand and yanks her to her feet
he slaps her hard and hisses at her in albanian
she tries to sit down again but he pulls her up and slaps her again
finally he shoves her into the middle of the room and she begins to dance sobbing as she does
no fucking crying
its a party
kirill and nikolai are climbing out of nikolais mercedes
kirill is in full flow as they walk towards the house
the rock music is audible outside the house
so he said to me who is this driver guy
i laughed so hard
kirill knocks on the door hard
and i said you were the safest guy id met
and what did he say
you know my dad
he didnt say nothing
but his eyes looked impressed
the door opens and the albanian opens his arms in welcome
get out of the fucking way you black gypsy baboon
kirill pushes his way inside and nikolai follows
kirill and nikolai are swigging whisky from the bottle and dancing with the girls
some of the girls are drinking too and managing to laugh
kirill is dancing maniacally and swinging his girl around faster and faster until she falls over
nikolai swigs his drink and notices the girl who refused to stand up
she is standing in the corner sobbing
nikolai doesnt care to look at her for more than a second and he goes back to dancing
after a moment kirill dances his way over to nikolai and yells above the music
ok which one you going to fuck
laughing whats it to you
im just enjoying myself man
kirill suddenly stops dancing and stares at nikolai
he yells again over the music
you hear me
youre going to fuck one of these girls
ok ok jesus
youre going to fuck one of these girls right now
thats an order
whats the matter with you
kirill suddenly goes to the stereo system and yanks the plug from the wall
the girls look terrified
the only sound is the sobbing of the girl who wont dance
kirill is glaring at nikolai
come on nikolai
who are you going to fuck
im recommending you to my dad
i want to make sure youre not a fucking queer
kirill looks suddenly wild
he swigs his whisky
a long pause
youve drunk enough kirill
kirill hurls his whisky bottle against the wall
the girls all flinch
you fucking siberian ox dont tell a vor what is enough
nikolai studies kirills anger
ive brought you to my dads best stable
he uses this place himself
theyre all clean
now im going to watch you fuck one of these girls to prove to me that you aint queer
so which one is it going to be
nikolai looks around the room
nikolai turns to the girl who is sobbing
nikolai is fucking the girl who is now silent
she is on all fours registering no emotion
kirill is leaning against the wall drinking wine from the bottle watching nikolai with burning eyes his lust and drunken jealousy mixing together
nikolai grits his teeth and comes inside the girl
kirill whoops and whistles and begins to applaud
the girl is still silent expressionless
you did ok
you did ok
nikolai glares at kirill
well if my examination is over get the fuck out of here while i get dressed
kirill grins and offers the girl an elaborate bow before leaving
finally alone nikolai gently helps the girl to lie down
she is numb
he covers her up with a blanket then begins to pull on his clothes
the girl is staring up at the ceiling
after a few moments she begins to sing a russian folk song softly under her breath
nikolai speaks to her softly in russian
in russian whats your last name
finally the girl stops singing but is silent
nikolai is insistent
in russian tell me your last name
in russian where are you from
she looks up and stares into nikolais eyes
she sees some urgency there
in ukrainian where
in ukrainian irpen
the girl is asking a silent question but nikolai doesnt linger
he heads for the door then stops and turns
in ukrainian stay alive a little longer
in the half lit private room anna is dancing with christine in her arms
she is singing a lullaby softly to her
the door is open to the rest of the ward and all the other babies are silent
finally she lays a sleeping christine back in her crib
she sits down on the bed where the mother should be
she curses herself silently and gets to her feet determined to pull herself together
as she starts to leave the private room to enter the ward she is suddenly confronted by semyon
he is standing in the shadows a bavarian trilby in his hands
anna gasps with shock
semyon speaks softly
i came on tiptoes
how did you get in here
pink revision a
there are always open doors anna ivanovna
anna glances at an alarm button
youre not allowed in here
please anna let me speak
semyon looks to be almost in tears
he speaks softly
i translated the diary
a baby begins to cry and is comforted somewhere across the ward
i was shocked to discover
that my son kirill is mentioned many times
semyon appears to be fighting tears
i have known for some years that he has strayed from the path i set out for him
his mother died when he was very young
anna almost begins to buy his sorrow
what does it say about him
semyon looks up his eyes filled with tears
many bad things
but anna please
let me deal with him
if the diary should find its way to the police
semyon wipes his eyes
some of the things my son did are illegal
anna he is a good boy
i dont care about him
i care about the baby
and that is the baby
semyon glances over annas shoulder into the corner where christine is sleeping
anna freezes and doesnt reply
semyon takes her hand
anna i have made some inquiries and i have found out an address for tatianas family in russia
thats where the baby belongs no
anna reacts but semyons face suddenly hardens
perhaps we can do a deal
he stares into her eyes
do you understand me anna
at that moment a nurse walks by and hesitates when she sees semyon
hes just leaving
semyon puts his hat onto his head
you know where i am anna ivanovna
and i know where you are
semyon disappears into the shadows of the ward
as anna reacts we hear tatiana in v
i was thrown down the stairs and fell onto some sacks like potato sacks
stepan is sitting at the kitchen table translating tatianas diary aloud as helen transcribes it onto a note pad
stepans translation breaks up with emotion but he tries to remain detached
helen also tries hard to concentrate on her task but wipes away a tear as she writes
slowly blends into stepans voice
like potato sacks
kirill came down after me and he hit me until i was bleeding
then he tried to rape me but he couldnt do it
he just got madder and madder and kept hitting me
in the end his father came down
it was the father who raped me
he shouted at his son
if you dont break a horse it will never be tame kirill
they hear a key in the door and prepare for annas arrival
when she enters she feels the tense silence
after a moment helen tries to be bright
how was your night
anna sees the tears in both their eyes
she sees the diary and the transcription and sits down
stepans arthritis is playing up
im taking dictation
helen gets to her feet
would you like some tea or something
anna gently pushes helen back into her seat
he came to see me
the man from the restaurant
he came to the hospital
stepan leaps to his feet
i told you this would happen
i told you
sit down stepan
the devil is loose now
everyone begins to talk at once
i know its my fault
its no ones fault
they are in this room now
they are cancer
we should just sit down calmly and think
i have a friend from ukraine who owns a gun
from the war in afghanistan
dont talk about guns
anna suddenly stands up
shut up both of you
everyone catches their breath
what would dad have done
we all know what he would have done
stepan heads for the kitchen cupboard and produces a bottle of vodka
rather than admonish him anna and helen both nod agreement
stepan pours three large vodkas
stepan knocks his down
anna and helen take sips
and then he would have been practical
he would ask if there were bullets for the gun
this isnt our world
i dealt with the vory v zakone when i worked for the kgb
you never worked for the fucking anna
primly i was an auxiliary
a stand off
what did this man want
in return hell give us an address for tatianas family
for christines family
they all look to each other
and thats all he wants
stepan is utterly astounded
you cannot do deals with these people
this isnt a deal
its an exchange of information
have you forgotten already what i just read to you
we must be practical
stepan i think he was threatening to harm christine
then its settled
repeating as a mantra stepan this isnt our world
we are ordinary people
stepan stares at them both for a long time
finally he gets to his feet and points to the diary
she was an ordinary person
anna and helen hold hands genuinely close now for the first time in a long time
nikolai pulls up in his car
he checks his look in the rear view mirror and puts on his sunglasses
as he gets out of the car he notices that annas motorbike is still there
he approaches it strokes the bodywork
suddenly someone grabs him from behind
hey come on nikolai ive got a christmas present for you
a white van is parked with its rear doors open ready for unloading
kirill shows nikolai that the van is loaded with unmarked white boxes
nikolai opens one of the boxes and produces a bottle of vintage champagne
old as fuck
old is good with wine
sixty quid a bottle anywhere
except i got them for ten quid a case
from where you dont ask
give it here
kirill snatches the bottle and begins to uncork it
if my dad says ok i can start telling you about the serious stuff
this booze is just for gifts to papas friends
the real import stuff is from kabul you understand
he pops the cork and swigs the frothing champagne
import export sounds good
you bet its fucking good
nikolai hands the bottle back
as he does one of the van doors is kicked closed revealing semyon suddenly upon them
jesus christ papa
you scared me
semyon grabs the bottle of champagne and smashes it on the floor
kirill recoils in terror
nikolai straightens faces up
were just sampling it
semyon is so furious he still cant speak
he grabs kirill and slams him against the wall
finally he hisses in his face
your friend soyka is dead
whats that got to do with me
dont lie to me
semyon slams kirill against the wall once more
i swear i dont know nothing about it
i said dont lie to me
semyon slams kirill hard against the wall again
suddenly nikolai steps forward
your dad is right kirill
theres no point lying to him
semyon and kirill are frozen for a moment
nikolai calmly lights a cigarette
ozims nephew slit soykas throat
kirill paid him to do it
there is stunned silence
semyon loosens his grip on kirill
in russian shut your fucking mouth
in russian your dad always knows the truth anyway
nikolai and semyon survey each other
but its ok boss
you dont have to worry
incredulous i dont have to worry
i disposed of the body myself
the police wont find a thing
semyon has now lost all interest in kirill and is concentrating on nikolai
he laughs with incredulity
my son commits a murder
on my own doorstep
a fellow soldier
and no one thought to tell me about it
the vory code says you dont talk to anybody about your captain
kirill is my captain
semyon circles nikolai
when i found out what had happened i did what i had to do to clean the situation up
kirill is about to speak but before he can nikolai speaks for him
it was a matter of honor
soyka was spreading lies about kirill
about your family
in russian kirill did the right thing
semyon hisses with fury and grabs nikolai
i decide what is right and what is wrong
you do not kill a vor for no reason
nikolai shrugs semyon off holding his ground
you know as well as i do soyka was talking to the police
semyon is shocked at the depth of nikolais knowledge
he peers at him
for a driver you are well informed
ive got connections with the chechens who export cars
soyka was speaking to the russian desk
in russian kirill did a good thing for all our people
our people will know that
in semyons silence kirill finally gathers courage
papa i swear to you i was going to
kirill is hurt that semyon seems only to be interested in nikolai
after studying nikolai for a while
if you are so well informed you will know soyka has brothers
with a smile thats ok
kirill has got me
semyon shows the first flicker of admiration
he then looks at kirill with utter contempt making the comparison with nikolai obvious
get these boxes out of sight
semyon leaves them
kirill is angry straightening his clothes
finally he yells
you heard him patsan
get these boxes out of sight
it is saturday morning and the place is full of families
christmas decorations are beginning to look ragged
anna and helen are sitting at a table terrified but trying hard to stay calm
stepan arrives with a tray of coffees and a burger
he sits and anna and helen glance uneasily at each other
stepan begins to eat noisily
how the hell can you eat
there is a tension that builds until nikolais mercedes suddenly looms into view filling the street window of the burger bar
nikolai gets out of his car all shades and sharp suit
thats their driver
stepan very deliberately slides his hand into his inside pocket
hissing tell me you havent done anything ridiculous
stepan removes his hand empty his bravado crushed
nikolai enters the restaurant and spots anna
he comes and sits at the table beside stepan opposite anna
its a tight squeeze
anna and helen are stiff with terror
meet in a public place with lots of people around
he smiles at helen
and i see you brought along a body guard
also very wise
stepan is shaking with emotion and hisses something in russian
whispers in russian when i was in the kgb we knew how to deal with scum like you
in russian when you were in what
nikolai is amused by the three of them
anna produces tatianas diary and hands it to nikolai
nikolai studies it and nods
he gets to his feet
shaking now you give me the address
i dont know what youre talking about
nikolai calmly heads for the door
i told you
i knew they would do this
anna gets to her feet
come back here
anna races out of the restaurant in pursuit of nikolai
nikolai has emerged into the busy suburban street and is about to get in to his car
anna flies at him yelling
she was fourteen
read the diary
she was fourteen when he raped her
nikolai casually hits the key fob of his car
you murdered her
you bastards murdered her
passers by stare at anna
helen and stepan have come out of the restaurant to restrain her
nikolai stops and judges the fury on annas face
he speaks calmly
anger is very dangerous
it makes people do stupid things
forget any of this ever happened
youre in the wrong place anna ivanovna
he gestures at the burger restaurant
you belong in there
with nice people
stay away from people like me
anna and nikolai are staring at each other suddenly a strange connection between them
then stepan steps forward and spits in nikolais face delivering a russian curse as he does so
nikolai almost reacts out of instinct but stops himself
nikolai wipes his face and peers into annas eyes
finally he gets into his car and drives away
nikolai is alone sitting at a candlelit table reading tatianas diary
we hear tatiana in voice over
i am not sure i can carry on another day
the windows wont open so i cant throw myself out
they inject me every day with heroin
sometimes i think this is all a hallucination
he sees semyon approaching from the kitchen and closes the diary
semyon grabs a bottle of vodka from the bar on his way to sit opposite nikolai
nikolai pushes the diary across the table
semyon pours two drinks
it is good to have someone who i can trust to do simple tasks
a pause as semyon glances at a few pages of diary
in this business sometimes the biggest danger comes from the most stupid things
you cant afford to be careless in any area
nikolai senses a change of attitude towards him
as if semyon were beginning to accept him into the fold
semyon raises a toast
after a moment
so what was the lie that soyka was spreading about my son
nikolai looks anxious
in russian it was nothing important
kirill had him killed for nothing important
semyon pours two more vodkas
i dont want to repeat it
smiling for me you will repeat it
nikolai doesnt respond
it is obvious that semyon half knows already
you play with the prince to do business with the king
but if you want to do business with me you must be open with me
thieves in law
semyon nurses his vodka
what was soyka saying about the prince
he stares into nikolais eyes
finally nikolai stammers
that he is a drunk
and that he is also
semyon swigs his vodka and nikolai swigs his
semyon pours two more
semyon has to stare out of the window to hide his emotion
softly in russian my only son
they both knock their drinks back
semyon looks suddenly angry as he peers out of the window
you know it never snows in this city
and its never hot
london is a city of whores and queers
semyon shrugs fighting deeper emotion
i think london is to blame for what he is
so why dont you go home
semyon smiles as if seeing moscow through the window
the cold gets into my bones
the kgb would be waiting for me
nikolai smiles ruefully and glances at semyon
they are called fsb now
whatever they call them they are worse even than the kgb were
maybe the kgb and the vory v zakone were partners in a marriage
we had rules they had rules
he swigs some more vodka
now in moscow the thieves dont wear tattoos and the police dont wear uniforms
you never know who they are
semyon seems to be taking the vodka less well than nikolai
he pours some more
youve heard about these new policemen
nikolai doesnt blink
they get under you over you behind you inside you
they are the ones you least expect
semyon peers at nikolai and nikolai doesnt respond
mention of the new breed of fsb agent causes an almost imperceptible tension in nikolai
is semyon too drunk to notice
there is a strange game going on here
for now nothing is revealed
semyon knocks back his vodka and nikolai does the same
semyon picks up the diary and holds it into the flame of the candle
it begins to burn and he drops it into the ashtray
the flames flicker for a while
the midwife said she had an uncle
i met him
so you know what he looks like
semyon peers at nikolai
she said he has read the diary
we cant trust a russian with that kind of information
in russian do you understand me
semyon gets to his feet and smiles
perhaps you can deal with him
semyon leaves nikolai to stare into the flames of the burning diary
anna exits pulling on her coat against the cold
she stops in her tracks when she sees her unchained motorbike parked in the parking bay
she hears nikolais voice over her shoulder
i thought id bring it back before it got stolen
lot of villains around
sorry about the chain
anna is about to walk quickly away
i got that address you wanted
anna turns and sees nikolai is offering a scrap of paper
a little village outside st
i know it
not much of a place for a kid to grow up in
especially not a girl
nikolai approaches and gives her the address
if you want my opinion the kid would be better off in london
maybe with you
tatianas family dont sound like the kind of people whod want another mouth to feed
you read the diary
nikolai looks all around
anna studies him unsure
so how can you keep doing what youre doing
i told you
im just a driver
anna sees some softness in his expression
their eyes lock
you look the other way
im a camera
the pictures stay in my head
anna sees pain in his eyes
she peers at the address
why did you bring me this
i dont know
i was passing
after a long moment anna turns away
is it true he was in the kgb
i dont know
well hes a brave old man
thats for sure
does he live with you
anna is about to answer but stops herself
nikolai peers at her and finally shrugs then turns to walk away
he gestures at the bike
i fixed it
it should be ok now
anna watches him walk away into the street
crowds of football supporters are streaming away from the football stadium where the floodlights are still casting their glow
there are arsenal and chelsea supporters on opposite sides of the street and there is some mildly vicious yelling between the two groups
police are visibly keeping order
among the crowd we see ekrem
he seems slightly drunk on top of his normal craziness
he has an arsenal scarf around his neck and is looking for trouble jeering at the chelsea supporters across the street
hey kabuka chelsea
a policeman steps up to ekrem and gives him a shove and he stumbles a little
as he gets to his feet we notice two chechen men who are trailing ekrem ducking their heads away from the line of policemen
ekrem is now isolated from the crowds swigging from a can of lager
he is chanting arsenal arsenal to himself as he walks
he stops to take a piss on someones grave
in the background the two chechens are coming closer
as ekrem zips his flies the chechens are upon him
one of them grabs his arsenal scarf and begins to strangle him
ekrem chokes for a while and the chechen loosens the knot
the second chechen pulls out an open razor
ekrem struggles to escape
for my brother
the chechen cuts ekrems throat then drops him onto the grave stone
the place has two dozen customers and there is a russian band playing dark eyes
at a particular table an old russian lady is having her birthday celebrated by an adoring family and lots of very ancient friends
there is a huge round of applause as semyon emerges from the kitchen with a cake decorated with sparklers
semyon returns to smoke and steam and yelling
as he prepares to take a drink one of the young dishwashers approaches
in russian guy out the back
semyon grabs a bottle of vodka
semyon emerges into the wine crates and beer bottles in the yard at the back of the restaurant where the doberman is straining at the leash snarling and barking
an already anxious ozim is cowering in the shadows held at bay by the dog
the moment semyon steps out the dog stops barking
ozim relaxes a little and steps forward
semyon pets the dog
so what did they say
semyon takes a swig of vodka
ozim looks severely nervous
they were going to kill me
those chechens are savages
ozim is reliving the ordeal
i pointed out that i am a muslim too and it is a sin for a muslim to kill a muslim
irritated what did they say about my son
they said they would spare me only if i delivered kirill to them
you are being very honest
i fear you more than i fear them
semyon suddenly breaks the neck of the bottle and holds the jagged edge to ozims throat
the dog snarls at semyons feet
never again do business with any member of my family behind my back
i will never listen to kirill again
semyon tosses the bottle away
after a moment
do they know where to find kirill
they are like wolves
do they know what he looks like
ozim shakes his head
they have just arrived from the mountains
then tell them you will deliver kirill to them
ozim is stunned
he stares at semyon as if he were insane
tell them to give you two days
anna is reading the translation of the diary by lamplight
tatianas voice over continues
i know now for sure that i am pregnant
it hasnt begun to show yet
after i was raped they made me take pills but i guess it was too late
i am condemned to give birth to a new life
but first i will try to find a way to end my own life and spare this child the pain
anna looks up from the pages and thinks
a large public housing estate is being swept by rain
christmas lights glow in the windows of the dilapidated tower blocks
stepan is walking against the wind carrying a bag of shopping
he holds onto his russian hat to stop it blowing away
kids splash in the puddles
stepan arrives at the front garden of his small ground floor council flat
as he fumbles for his keys in the cold we see that nikolai is watching him from the drivers seat of his mercedes
once stepan has disappeared into his flat nikolai gets out of the car and approaches stepans flat
helen is preparing food for a small family dinner
anna enters with her cellphone in her hand
she mooches for food to hide her agenda
i cant get hold of stepan
why do you want to
i need to check something with him
matter of fact hes not at home do you know where else he might be
helen simply stares at her
havent you had enough excitement
deadpan i think ive worked out who christines father is
helen slams her knife down
yelling why does it matter
firmly it matters
after a moment helen goes to her holds her hands and peers into her eyes
we expect comforting words but instead
you enjoy this
youre like your father
ordinary life isnt enough
anna turns and walks out of the house
anna drives her motorbike through north london streets
rain is falling
anna is standing in the falling rain staring over at the trans siberian restaurant
the restaurant is busy with the noise of revelers swelling every time the door is opened
anna seems to be exiled from where she should really be inside a restaurant like this with its danger and vibrancy
suddenly she is illuminated by headlights
she turns and sees that nikolai is pulling up in his mercedes
kirill is in the passenger seat
nikolai gets out of the car and stops when he sees anna
anna is like a fox caught in headlights
what are you doing here
echoing nikolais words i dont know
i was passing
kirill studies the gaze between nikolai and anna and senses the connection
if youre passing you pass
you keep going bitch
nikolai come on
kirill grabs nikolais arm and after peering at anna for a moment he turns to go with kirill
anna gathers her courage
family is important to you people isnt it
laughing you people
in russian what the hell is she talking about
music swells from the restaurant
tell semyon the baby i delivered on christmas eve is his daughter
kirill and nikolai stop
a swell of laughter from the restaurant
anna is about to continue but nikolai steps forward and places two fingers on annas lips to stop her from saying anymore
anna tears his hands from her mouth
at the same time kirill yells in russian
in russian what did she say
anna is terrified but angry too
when he raped her she was a virgin
then they gave her pills
semyon has to be the father
kirill suddenly goes for her over the bonnet of the car
in russian shes a civilian
kirill pushes anna up against the car but she fights him
she was fourteen
she was a child
kirill slaps anna hard
nikolai grabs kirill and pulls him away
you dont use my fathers name
you dont say that filth about him
he goes for anna again and this time nikolai shoves kirill to the wet ground
he looks up at nikolai and slowly gets to his feet
he wipes his hands then stares into nikolais eyes
dont even look at her any more
headlights from a passing car sweep the scene
thats an order
nikolai peers at anna for a moment
annas voice is defiant but cracking with fear
tell him what i said
nikolai has taken what anna said on board
he speaks softly
there is nothing to tell
slaves give birth to slaves
come on nikolai
he turns to anna
and if you open your mouth again ill tell my driver to stick his cock inside it
maybe thats what you want
he offers the lights of the restaurant to her as a vicious invitation
you want to come in
maybe we all get to fuck you
anna stares back
nikolai peers at her for a moment before grabbing kirill and pulling him away towards the restaurant
the place is winding up
chefs and waiters are cleaning surfaces and dishes
the only still point is semyon who is cutting and wrapping the birthday cake in small parcels of golden paper
he works intensely and delicately at the back of the kitchen
nikolai and kirill enter
kirill swigs a half drunk glass of wine
that girl you fucked in front of me
you remember her
the ukrainian bitch
so they kick down the door
these are ordinary fucking police
they ask for her by name and they take her away
some fucking punter must have given them her name
what gives the police the right to take our women huh
semyon shoots kirill a hard look hes talking too much and too loudly
kirill ignores the look
hey papa i never seen so many old people in one place
whose party is it out there
the angel of death
in russian she is one hundred years old
semyon works on for a moment then glances at kirill
kirill go down into the cellar and bring up some brandy
kirill turns to leave
come on nikolai help me
he stays here
i want to talk business
a confused pause
kirill looks from nikolai to his father
a pause as kirill suddenly senses his exclusion
papa what business
his business is my business
semyon stares at kirill and kirill knows the look
go to the cellar kirill
and take your time
he is angry as hell but too scared of his fathers gaze to say anything
finally he turns fast and departs slamming his open hand against the door as he goes
semyon waits a moment before returning to the business of cutting the cake
did you deal with the old man
semyon looks up and fixes nikolai with a stare
in russian its time you joined us
a long moment
the thing nikolai has been working for has finally happened
there seems to be little joy
in russian thank you
semyon returns to his work
what shall i tell kirill
semyon continues with the cake unconcerned
tell him i changed my mind about the brandy
the cellar is half lit the arched walls lined with crates of wine
flour grease and potatoes are stored here
as nikolai walks down the steps into the gloom he hears kirill singing a russian folk song to himself as he drags a case of brandy across the cellar floor
kirill has already opened a bottle of brandy and takes a long swig as nikolai joins him
he grins as he gestures at the brandy
my dad swapped a little georgian girl for this stuff
nikolai sits down on a crate rests his head against the wall
kirill joins him and swigs some more
hey dont feel bad
what happened up there is just how he is
he plays people against each other
i realize more and more what hes like
here drink to the georgian girl
kirill offers the bottle to nikolai but he refuses
i drink alone now
nikolai decides to bite the bullet get this news over with
he offered me stars
i accepted them
a long pause
this is what kirill wanted but now it feels like a stab in the back
finally kirill swallows a huge swig of brandy then turns awkwardly to hug nikolai
he squeezes him hard for a long time then shoves him away
lying you think i didnt know already
he told me before
it was my fucking idea
he said there are a lot of things i have to teach you
kirill gets to his feet
some stuff will take a long time
ive been protecting you until now
you think i dont know stuff you dont know
i am vor by birth
the stars are a birthmark for me
i know kirill
kirill is about to fly into a rage but nikolai gets to his feet
where the fuck are you going
weve got to celebrate
help me with these bottles
nikolai heads for the steps
your dad dont need the bottles any more
as nikolai departs kirill calls after him
were still partners right
thunder and lightning
nikolai climbs the steps
kirill is left to swig his brandy and stare into the darkness
he wipes his eyes angrily with his sleeve
sweet russian choral music covers the next four scenes
the street outside the restaurant is now flooding with rain
a daimler and a bentley are already parked
a large suv pulls up and a hard looking russian man in his sixties valery is ushered from the car by bodyguards in suits and shades
he is greeted by a darker looking man in his fifties the gypsy who has a fur coat around his shoulders
semyon is waiting on the doorstep dressed in a fine dark suit
the curtains are drawn against the rainy light
the gypsy valery semyon and two other russian men are sitting in a line behind a restaurant table like a judging panel
after a moment nikolai enters dressed in suit and tie for the biggest interview of his life
the vory behind the table greet him
then nikolai takes off his jacket and removes his tie
he then takes off his shirt to reveal that his upper body is decorated with elaborate tattoos details to follow
he carefully places his shirt over the chair then sits down
the panel of the vory study his body the gypsy pushing a candle across the table to better illuminate the detail of the tattoos
only after the men have studied the tattoos does the interview begin
the following dialogue should not be translated and can be cut around to suggest a long and grueling interview
we can see that you were in prison in siberia
and that you were a thief
my father was a government worker
he fixed the cars of officials
i began by selling the spare parts when i was fifteen
you have no forced tattoos
you were not co operative
i spent two years in the punishment block
you went through the crosses in st
i was in solitary confinement fifteen times
i was called the stump because they couldnt shift me
your father was a bitch and a weak fucker for working with the government thats right isnt it
nikolai flickers a little
my father means nothing to me
you have no mother
she was a whore anyway
i have no mother and no father
there is only the code the vory v zakone code which i have always followed
that is why there is an empty place above your heart
where the stars will go
and why there is an empty place on your knees
i am dead already
i died when i was fifteen
now i live in the zone all the time
you have never worked for the government
i have lived off albanians and georgians
i steal from them within the law
the questions and answers are delivered with great solemnity making the ceremony feel almost religious
candles burn the men all sip water
semyon is silent throughout but listens attentively
towards the end of the interview there is the ghost of a smile on the gypsys face and this pleases semyon
a wizened old russian man the tattooist arrives at the kitchen door carrying a battered leather case
the kitchen door is opened as he arrives and semyon greets him
the choral music continues as we see the old man opening his case and pulling out tattooing equipment
nikolai is sitting in a banquette at the back wearing only his underpants
we circle nikolai as the tattooist begins to work on his knees preparing nikolais knee caps for the tattoos
the needle bites at nikolais skin as the old tattooist wipes away the blood
then we see the needle working on the empty spaces above nikolais heart tattooing the star symbol
nikolai now has a star tattoo on each knee and two eight pointed stars on his chest
he is now a member of the vory v zakone
anna is lying awake her curtains drawn against the daylight
helen knocks and enters with a cup of tea just as in the opening scenes
anna sits up
almost accusing have you slept at all
anna doesnt answer
helen looks anxious as she peeks out of the curtains
i tried to get hold of stepan for you
hes usually either at home or at his sisters
but she hasnt heard from him at all
helen is trying to hide her anxiety but anna sees it
he did spit in that horrible mans face
i dont think the driver would do anything to stepan
helen knows anna well senses some flicker of attraction
how do you know what he would do
you havent spoken to him since have you
anna doesnt answer and helens anger sparks
she leaves and slams the door
we are in st
pancras north london
ozim is waiting nervously blowing into his hands against the cold
the turkish bath building is a victorian red brick edifice
nikolai pulls up in his mercedes
ozim and nikolai are undressing
the place is deserted apart from an old turkish bath house attendant who is distributing towels
ozim is unbuttoning his shirt
semyon recommends these places for business meetings because you can see what tattoos a man has
nikolai is pulling off his shirt and ozim reacts to the sight of the fresh eight pointed star tattoos
we have a lot to get through
ozim disappears into a steam room naked
nikolai watches him go a private agenda bubbling beneath the surface
ozim and nikolai sit side by side sweating
there is no one else in the steam room
our lines to kabul get broken every two or three weeks
pause valery nabokov imports flowers and television sets into this country
the television sets are one in ten
that means one in ten have cargo inside them
where do they dock
i will tell you when i return from the bathroom
ozim chuckles as he leaves in a swirl of steam
nikolai leans back against the cold wall his tattoo almost the only visible thing through the steam
ozim is dressing frantically his face suddenly betraying his real anxiety
he checks his watch as he puts it back on his wrist
after a moment the two chechen brothers who killed ekrem enter the changing room
they swagger up to ozim
pink revision a
he gulps down his fear
kirill is in there
ozim slaps his chest to denote the place where they will see the vor tattoo
they head towards the steam room as ozim grabs his shoes and hurries towards the exit
nikolai is sweating hard staring at the ceiling
the steam room door opens but the steam is now so thick he cant see who has entered
he sees a shape
a clothed body
he realizes immediately
suddenly one of the brothers is upon him and has him in a head lock
he strokes the tattoo on nikolais chest as if this were confirmation of who this is
he grunts an instruction and his brother emerges through the steam with an open razor
nikolai is naked alone
suddenly he kicks the razor guy in the balls and uses a martial arts chop to free himself from the other brother
in the steam there are boots and bare feet and knees and fingers flying
nikolai manages to gouge the eye of one brother and throw another against the wall
he obviously has serious combat training but the brothers are strong and angry
suddenly nikolai is slashed across the arm by the razor and blood oozes into the steam and hot water
all the men are slipping and falling on the blood and hot water
another slash of the razor cuts his thigh open
all the men are now covered in blood and nikolai with a final surge of strength manages to cripple one brother with a blow to the throat and the other
with an elbow to the temple
as the chechens slump to the floor nikolai fumbles in the bloody water for the razor finds it kneels and slashes their throats
he lurches to his feet drops the razor and staggers out of the steam room
aziz and a group of a dozen doctors and nurses are eating lunch some in party hats some drinking red wine out of paper cups
aziz seems anxious distracted
anna enters in a hurry locates aziz and joins him
im so late
she looks around the party with horror
its fine although i think ive had enough
he smiles and downs his glass of wine in one go
paul on my way here i made a decision
mock horror you cant possibly dump me
were not even going out
take my hand
aziz confused takes her hand
feel my pulse
aziz feels annas pulse
anna takes a deep breath
im going to apply to adopt christine
can you feel that
yes i can
nikolai is being hurried down the corridor his face covered with an oxygen mask
he is covered with a surgical gown which is covered in blood
his arm flops out from under the covers as the paramedics rush him into the hospital
anna is walking in the opposite direction
then as nikolais trolley passes anna sees nikolais arm flopping from under the covers
she sees the eagle tattoo on the back of his hand
nikolai is conscious in bed attached to a single drip
his wounds have been stitched up
a doctor and two nurses are settling nikolais vital signs moving around him checking his temperature
finally they clear the bed and through the glass of the room we see anna standing outside staring in at nikolai
nikolai is peering through half opened eyes
the last nurse is checking his vital signs
then anna enters
the nurse stops work
is it ok to talk to him for a minute
the nurse hesitates
hes still in trauma
do you know him
anna glances at nikolai who is rousing himself
the nurse is reluctant but sees annas fierce stare and finally leaves
after she has gone nikolai stirs focuses on her face
i thought you did birth
nikolai smiles but anna is trying hard to even out her fear and anger
nikolai tries to sit up and registers pain
the one who spat in your face
nikolai gasps in pain as he raises himself up
anna sees the wounds on his arms and glimpses the tattoos on his chest scaring her even more
if we dont hear from him soon were going to the police
nikolai reaches for a bottle of water and manages to take a swig
anna is impatient for a reaction
do you know where he is
nikolai finishes the bottle of water in one thirsty swig
hes in scotland
in a five star hotel
anna is locating the door in case she has to flee as nikolai swings his legs out of the bed to stretch his painful limbs
im going to need some clothes
i arrived here without any
can you get me some
anna doesnt budge
i cant walk out of here naked
you cant walk out of here because youre attached to a drip
nikolai sighs sits back down on the bed
he finally speaks softly
your uncle knew too much
i was told to get rid of him
i was meant to send him to heaven with a bullet in his head
instead i sent him to edinburgh
with a first class ticket
he is of the old school
he understood the situation
exile or death
edinburgh was his idea
he said they throw a great party at new year
and he said it was a good excuse to get away from his family
nikolai smiles at anna
just a pair of jeans and a t shirt
and some shoes
anna still looks disbelieving
the hotel is called the caledonian
without a pause anna leaves
anna is sitting on the bed beside christines crib
christine is asleep
anna is speaking into her cell phone trying to keep her voice down
into phone no i couldnt get much sense out of him he was drunk
anna looks exasperated
into phone mum i dont want to tell you how i found him because i dont want another argument
i just wanted you to know hes definitely safe
anna listens with weariness
into phone no we cant tonight
i need the money
a pause for a place of my own for christs sake
she listens with growing anger until she finally cuts the call without a word
christine stirs but doesnt wake
she leans back against the wall already regretful
the ward is busy as yuri the police specialist from the russian desk enters wearing a heavy overcoat
he looks all around and approaches a nurse
nikolais drip is being removed by a nurse
nikolai is examining his healing wounds
then through the glass of the door he notices yuri speaking to a nurse and obviously recognizes him
the nurse points yuri in nikolais direction
its cold and the wind is blowing
we see rooftops behind them
yuri is lighting nikolais cigarette
nikolai is wearing yuris overcoat loosely over his hospital gown
yuri lights his own cigarette and they smoke in silence for a moment
you got my message
using a dead body to file a progress report must be against fsb regulations
its called improvisation
youve been improvising quite a lot lately
and taking risks
he glances at the cuts on nikolais hands
in russian maybe too many
nikolai suddenly glares at yuri
in russian you didnt come here to give me flowers
yuri shakes his head and prepares to deliver bad news
nikolai turns as if to go back inside
yuri grabs nikolais arm and speaks formally
in light of what has happened to you
nikolai shakes his head wearily
in russian ah christ
and in light of other violent incidents associated with you the russian desk at scotland yard have made an official request to the russian embassy that your undercover operation in
london be terminated
nikolai doesnt react for a moment
in russian you have gone beyond what was agreed
with his cigarette dangling from his mouth nikolai begins to unbutton his overcoat
in my opinion you should see this as good news
youve been in the zone far too long
nikolai turns and slowly pulls open the overcoat and the thin hospital gown beneath it
he reveals the eight pointed star tattoos on his chest and yuri reacts with absolute astonishment
if they terminate the operation now they will be wasting this
yuri looks shocked and slightly horrified
nikolai too suddenly seems almost ashamed that he has got this far
after a long silence nikolai mumbles
you tell the russian desk you saw stars over my heart
tell them im through the door
yuri is still overwhelmed
they are bound to ask
who did you kill
in russian tell them i only killed myself
yuri is humbled
they share a moment of understanding as they smoke
and you can tell them im going to replace semyon at the head of the london organization
what drugs are they giving you
maybe its the anesthetic speaking
i need you to take semyon out of the picture
i want you to arrest him
nikolai lights another cigarette from the stub of the one he is smoking
yuri is incredulous
arrest him for what
yuri begins to chuckle
the girl was fourteen
incredulous and of course she will testify
she doesnt have to
but she had semyons baby
if you prove the baby is his and prove the girl was under age when the baby was conceived thats statutory rape
yuri begins it think it through
all you need is the baby and some of semyons dna
for poetic reasons i suggest you take his blood
yuri peers at nikolai with awe
a long pause
finally yuri smiles
you intrigue me
if we had never had this conversation they would have sent you home
you could have spent the spring in the mountains
riding your bicycle to your office every morning through fields of flowers
nikolai reacts but doesnt answer
you keep in touch
yuri studies nikolai
in russian and take care mikhail
yuri tenderly takes his overcoat from nikolais shoulders and goes back through the fire escape door
nikolai is left cold and exposed in his thin gown
nikolai is playing chess against himself sitting on the bed trying hard to concentrate
there is a knock and anna enters carrying an old shopping bag
she takes out a worn pair of jeans and a t shirt a denim jacket and a battered pair of shoes
how is uncle stepan
instead of answering anna lays the clothes on the bed
deadpan theyre from the morgue
they belonged to someone who died yesterday
nikolai picks up the jeans and examines them
theyre way too big
i cant believe im doing a favor for someone just because he had the decency not to murder a member of my family
nikolai smiles but anna turns to leave
wait a minute
nikolai steps behind the bed screen to pull on the jeans
he speaks from behind the screen
is your bike still working ok
anna considers leaving but hesitates
nikolai steps out from behind the screen the baggy jeans tightly belted his chest bare
for the first time anna sees the extent of nikolais body tattoos and reacts
nikolai sees her reaction to the tattoos and doesnt care for it
he grabs the t shirt and pulls it on
did you get in touch with tatianas family in russia
nikolai is now dressed his cut and tattooed arms still showing
so the babys still in england
shes staying here for good
they peer at each other
why do you care
nikolai shrugs and grabs the shoes
stepan said you were kind to him
he said you were risking your own life to keep him alive
yeah and all the thanks i get is a pair of dead mans shoes
pause i listen to you
sarcastic do you really
about semyon and the baby
still wary you thank me for that
their eyes lock across a huge divide
he rubs the tattoos on his arm
indicating tattoos these things are just marks on the skin you know
an awkward pause then anna turns and leaves quickly
the restaurant is filled with balloons of every color all over the floor and bouncing off the tables
a large happy new year banner is hanging from the wall
kirill is sitting on the floor amongst the balloons blowing up another one
maria semyons little granddaughter runs in to the restaurant and stops to stare at kirill
he begins to inflate another balloon then stops
in russian what are you looking at
in russian you
maria comes to him and take a balloon
she tries to blow it up but fails
kirill smiles and blows it up for her
what were you and grandpa shouting about last night
it sounded like something
kirill takes a deep breath to blow a balloon then stops and looks at maria
someone i know got hurt and i blamed grandpa
did you fight each other
i heard banging
its not a fight if one of you doesnt fight back
we see slight abrasions
so today i do as i am told
she nods and kirill blows another balloon
at that moment kirill sees on the security monitor behind the bar that a police car is pulling up outside the restaurant
his face clouds as another pulls up beside it
semyon sits at a bare table opposite yuri from the russian desk
a uniformed officer stands nearby and there is a police doctor with a medical bag sitting at the next table waiting
the whole scene is rendered surreal by all the balloons which bounce around them
semyon is in full charming old man mode
in russian youll have a drink yuri
he is half on his feet
in russian i dont drink on duty
in russian sometimes i dont believe you are really russian
in russian ive told you i am half russian
in russian then have half a drink
yuri shakes his head
semyon goes to the optic and helps himself to a vodka
so what is all this nonsense
we just need a blood sample
we can take the sample right now voluntarily or i can get an order from the court
its up to you
semyon glances at the doctor and chuckles
in russian he sits there like a vampire
in russian what you are afraid of needles semyon
semyons face hardens and he glares at yuri
i am afraid of
yuri speaks softly
i will return tomorrow with a court order
he gets to his feet
ive done nothing wrong
semyon begins to roll up his sleeve revealing a long scroll of tattoos
then a needle is being pushed into semyons arm by the doctor
semyons face doesnt flicker
he stares into yuris eyes
kirill is preparing food for the nights festivities
semyon enters and goes straight to the sink
he pulls off the plaster from his arm where the blood was taken and pours some vodka over the tiny puncture hole
what did they want with you papa
to poison me
semyon pours more vodka on the wound then takes a swig
they took blood from me with a needle
probably the same needle they use for all the junkies and whores and blacks and queers
he glares at kirill as he rolls his sleeve down
now i probably have the fucking queer disease
kirill has his back turned doesnt react
semyon sits heavily
why would they want your blood papa
for the first time semyon looks vulnerable and confused as he admits
i dont know
kirill is surprised to see his father unsure
he peers at him
someone is ahead of me
i dont like people ahead of me
kirill is now unnerved by semyons quiet confusion
he watches as semyon grabs at the bottle of vodka to drink
he speaks softly as he swigs
softly what the hell did that cocksucker want with my blood
kirill is reluctant to speak at first but eventually chances his arm
maybe its about the baby
swigging what baby
some bitch was out there saying you were the father of a baby
semyon turns to kirill his face hardening
what are you talking about
semyon approaches and kirill gets scared
it was nothing
just some bitch
the woman from the hospital
semyon stares into kirills eyes and kirill mistakes his frantic thought process for anger
kirill backs away
semyon is beginning to catch up
the main entrance of the hospital is busy with visitors and staff
there is a happy new year banner across the entrance
in amongst the bustle of visitors we spy a young man with his collar turned up and a bunch of red roses in his hand
we then see that it is kirill entering the hospital
anna is walking down a corridor with her crash helmet in her hand heading for another shift
we are close on kirills face as he studies a map of the hospital near the elevators
anna comes down a stairwell and spots kirill she especially notices the roses just as he gets into an elevator
the elevator doors close
was it really him
anna is not sure
a door opens and kirill steps into striped moonlight
clamping the roses under his arm he pulls a black zip up sports bag from under his coat
after a brief dialogue with himself he produces a half bottle of vodka and takes a swig
then he hurries on
anna walks onto the ward in her uniform
she checks a few stats as she walks by various beds
she then glances over at christines private room
she tiptoes into the room and goes to the crib
she finds it empty except for a bunch of red roses
outside the ward is now filling up with visitors
babies cry people laugh
anna goes back out to the ward and calls to a nurse
is someone bathing christine
shes in her cot
calmly well shes not
anna runs at breakneck speed through the corridors
kirill is at the wheel of nikolais mercedes
he swigs from his bottle of vodka which is now more than half empty
he fires the engine and reverses
a car passing by has to slam on its brakes
hey you stupid fucker
a horn blows
the passing car accelerates angrily by
then we hear a baby crying
kirill looks into the half darkness of the back seat and we see kirills black sports bag partially zipped up
christine is crying inside it her little grasping hand protruding past the zipper
kirill speaks softly
be quiet baby
its pink revision
anna flies out of nikolais room and spots a nurse
what happened to the patient with the knife cuts
we just discharged him
a couple of minutes ago
anna runs out
anna runs fast down the corridor towards the hospital exit
she spots nikolai ahead of her
she pushes past a couple of drunks and flies at him
where have they taken christine
where will he take her
people back away as nikolai grabs annas arms and holds her still
what are you talking about
anna studies nikolais face and sees his genuine confusion
she calms down a little
kirill has taken christine
i saw him here
i thought he was coming to see you but he wasnt was he
nikolai curses under his breath and thinks fast
you brought your bike
the same dockside where nikolai dumped soyka and recommended this as the best place to dispose of a body
kirill pulls up slowly in nikolais mercedes
the car is parked for a long time before finally the headlights are switched off
nikolai and anna race to annas motorbike
anna and nikolai leap aboard the bike and it starts first time
with nikolai riding pillion they roar away
anna and nikolai ride through london streets
on the edge of the dockside kirill is kneeling with the zip up bag before him
suddenly fireworks begin to burst over the thames
it is the stroke of midnight
kirill unzips the bag
when he looks inside christine stops crying
he peers at her wiping away tears
shes a little girl papa a little sweet fucking girl
kirill sobs then christine cries
kirill lifts her out of the bag and holds her close to him fireworks still illuminating the london skyline
he looks down at the freezing cold water utterly confused
in russian im sorry my little sister
blue revision a
for a moment we believe he is going to throw her into the water
instead he begins to sing a lullaby to her and her crying stops
then we see a single light behind him
in a firework flash we see nikolai and anna climbing off the bike
they approach cautiously
kirill stares at the man he loves
christine begins to cry
kirill let me take the baby
you stay where you are
shes cold kirill
kirill suddenly screams as another barrage of fireworks explodes
nikolai doesnt move
kirill is dangerously close to the edge of the dock
maybe hell throw himself in too
kirill a vor doesnt kill little babies
kirill is motionless
something like this would be bad for all of us
your dad has gone too far kirill
in russian its our turn now
nikolai steps forward slowly
as he gets closer kirill hugs the baby
finally nikolai reaches kirill and hugs him
as he does he edges him away from the dockside
the three of them are locked in a long embrace
nikolai emerges from the embrace with christine in his arms
he quickly hands her to anna who hugs her close
kirill turns to nikolai
i swear i didnt know my dad was setting you up
hes going away
when hes gone the family business will be yours
we can be partners again
thunder and lightning right
kirill smiles through his tears and nods
get into the car
ill drive you home
kirill dries his eyes and heads for the car
nikolai looks at anna who is hugging the baby
he waits a long time before realizing he must leave her
youre ok yeah
who are you really
why have you helped us
nikolai cant answer truthfully though he longs to do so
there is a long pause before he manages to finds a suitable lie
how can i become king if the king is still in place
anna studies him unsure
more new year fireworks explode over the river
kirill yells from the car
you come on nikolai
were missing the fucking party of the year out there
get here and drive
in russian thats a fucking order
nikolai and anna peer at each other
maybe i can drive you somewhere
she shakes her head
theres someone i can call
hell come and fetch us
nikolai nods not liking the information but hiding it
nikolai comes close and gently uncovers christines face
kirill is hooting the car horn
after a moment nikolai and anna kiss each other gently before nikolai heads for the car
a summers day
anna helen and uncle stepan are preparing to eat sunday lunch
stepan is carving
the conversation is jovial as anna and helen bring dishes of food to the table
then we hear a baby crying
anna goes to a small crib and lifts a six month old christine out
she hands her to helen who hugs her
over this happy scene we hear tatiana in v
a repeat of the first words we heard her say
my name is tatiana
my father died in the mines in my village so he was already buried when he died
anna takes christine back and takes her to the window to peer outside staring across the park
nikolai is sitting at a window table alone sipping vodka staring back across the park
he peers out at ordinary life going on in the streets outside
we were all buried there
beneath the soil of russia
that is why i left to find a better life
nikolai finishes his drink
