written by sarah thorp sept first draft dec st
clear sky snow on the ground
cold as fuck
with the sounds of laughter and music we move in on an office xmas party in progress not a pretty sight tipsy receptionists laugh and spill drinks on the rug
red faced reporters loosen their belts and burp cocktail weiners
arriving just in time for the door to slam in our face
a woman stomps back over to her desk and picks up her pen
meet cassidy daley dirty blond striking manic energy
ink stained fingers notepads in every pocket cass doesnt have time for office parties shes working
her door cracks open and stewart almost as good looking as he thinks he is appears holding a kahlua bottle
im working stewart
come on take a break
enticing ive got kahlua
cass picks up a stapler and launches it at stewarts head
stewart ducks out just in time
the phone rings
answering cassidy daley
talk to me

ive got a confirmed place and time
cass is on her feet excited
i love you
you think im gonna say this shit over the phone
i could get killed

he hangs up
cass drops the phone grabs her stuff
cass races for the elevator stewart hot on her heels where ya going
i go there for the hot wings
nobody goes there for the hot wings
you got a tip
you got a hundred bucks on you
stewart considers this then hands her s
now are you gonna let me in on it
no can do
i have to protect my source
you know what
we need to talk about our relationship
we dont have a relationship
we made out years ago in the copy room
i was drunk
i was broken hearted
i would have made out with the xerox machine
yes but you made out with me
i have to go
he shouts after her i want in on that story
cass driving like a maniac doing the one thing she loves jimmy s goatee mets baseball hat nervous sits in his car rolling a cigarette while he waits for cass
jimmy puts the cigarette in his mouth and pulls out a lighter
just as he flips the lighter open his front heavyset crew cut rarely speaks all business reaches through the broken window and drags jimmy out of the car
cass drives into the lot and pulls up next to jimmys car
hey jimmy i
she realizes he is not in the car
then she sees the broken jimmy
screeching tires behind her
cass glances up and sees jimmys baseball hat in the back window of a grey chevy
the chevy is racing out into traffic
cass throws her car into reverse
cass tries to follow the grey chevy but gets stuck at a red light
she looks around decides fuck it and hits the gas
her car leaps into the intersection
cass looks into her rearview mirror a patrol car is right behind her signalling for her to pull over
up ahead the chevy is getting away
cass debates pull over
or follow the story
she cass car speeds down the street a cop car in close cass is losing sight of the chevy
she races around traffic and is suddenly headed straight for the side of a moving van
she panics wrenching the wheel to the right
cass is out of her car now arguing with a cop who has her by the arm let go of me im a reporter im warning you
the cop pulls her towards his squad car
cass leans over and sinks her teeth into the cops hand
the cop screams
close on a newspaper column with cass photo windswept hair head tilted coyly smile that says im on top of the world
beneath the photo the byline cassidy daley
someone whistles we wish you a merry xmas as a marker improves on the photo moustache buck teeth pimples
then a match enters frame and sets the photo on fire
holding the flaming photo meet milo rumpled shirt messy hair looks like he slept on the floor
the bartender crystal s eastern european scowls at him what did i say about the fires
you said please set fires in my bar
wait no thats not right
please dont set fires in my bar
off her look ok jeez you try to get in the holiday spirit
he drops the flaming photo to the floor pours his drink on it then grinds it to pieces with his shoe
shouldnt you be working
thats the beauty of my job crystal
tracking down idiots is something you can do pretty much anywhere
see theres one
he points to a drunk draped over the jukebox mournfully and theres another one
pointing to a woman trying to rip a pay phone from the wall
glances at the tv which is showing live footage of an xmas parade
looks closer recognizes someone groans i dont believe it
to crystal save my seat
tosses back his drink and splits
milo climbs into a cadillac dents patches of rust cracked windshield bumper askew
rack to half a block away a dark sedan idles at the curb
the man behind the wheel dwight large babyfaced metallica t shirt eats a hoagie as he watches milo get into his car
there you are you dipshit
he takes a last bite then tosses the sandwich and pulls away from the curb tailing the cadillac
move in on the parade we just saw on tv
baton twirlers in santa hats
men dressed like reindeer pulling a sleigh
a boys choir singing joy to the world the kids dressed like orphans that escaped a broadway musical
a beautiful scene if you like that sort of thing
rack to the cadillac half a block away cruising sideways into a spot just beneath a temporary tow away sign
milo climbs out of the car
shoves his way through the crowd to the curb cracking open a can of pabst
milo does not like this sort of thing
he scans the crowd impatiently
meanwhile the car that was following him parks half a block away
dwight emerges and heads for milo who has just found what hes looking for
the reindeer are passing him and he makes eye contact with rudolph who does a double take
come here you fucking ding dong
milo takes a step towards rudolph and dwight appears in we have to stop meeting this way
not now dwight
you owe my boss money
hey i owe everybody money
suddenly dwight punches milo in the gut
milo doubles up gasping then brings his head up quick catching dwight on the chin
dwight goes flying sideways and meets a police barrier face first
the barrier tips over knocking over the one next to it
the rest go like dominos
milo turns to see that rudolph has disappeared
then he catches sight of the antlers working their way through the crowd
milo lunges after him and rudolph drags other reindeer with him as he tries to avoid milo
the sleigh flips
santa tumbles from the sled
packages all of a sudden its the xmas from hell bloody reindeer screaming parents panicking
meanwhile milo is gaining on rudolph who picks up one of the packages and throws it
it cracks milo in the head
just what milo has been waiting for i am so happy you did that
milo tackles rudolph to the ground
around them people scream and scatter
one boy bursts into tears that man is killing rudolph
cops swarm the scene surrounding milo and rudolph guns drawn
the lead cop gelman short over zealous steps forward release the reindeer
release the reindeer
milo looks around
hes got or so guns pointed his way and rudolph gasping at his feet
milo starts to laugh
gelman bristles hands behind your head asshole
take it easy skippy im just doing my job
milo flashes his id
gelman inspects it rolls his eyes
why dont you get a real job
so i can be like you patrol boys and sit around all day with my thumb up my ass
gelman turns bright red
what did you just say
suddenly a sergeant bobby late s obnoxious but likeable milos ex partner marches onto the scene takes one look at milo and laughs
i shoulda known
sarg you know this asshole
i know this asshole
guy used to be one of us
milo drags rudolph through the crowd towards his car
bobby follows shaking his head bemused expression on his face
look milo i know this is a tough time of year for you
this isnt a tough time of year for me
who doesnt love christmas
and i try to be sensitive to your situation
being a man who works his own hours and has his freedom and lives the high life
because i realize youre unhappy
are you kidding me bob
look at me im the happiest man alive
just then they come to where milo left his car
bobby squints at the huge tow away sign that sign is pretty hard to see
and with that milo loses it he rips the sign off the pole
stomps on it
tries to shred it with his teeth
he doesnt really seem like the happiest man alive
rudolph to bobby take me to jail
bobbys car is decorated with photos of his many children all of whom look exactly like him even the girls poor kids
milos in front by bobby rudolphs handcuffed in the back
ok i got one for ya why doesnt santa have any children
cause he only comes once a year and when he does its down a chimney
milo does not
bobby glances at milo
have you talked to her lately
talked to who
katie couric motherfucker who do you think
i havent talked to her in three years why would i talk to her now
well for one thing so you can stop taking out your rage on innocent bystanders
piping up from the back talk to her man
milo reaches back gags rudolph with his own scarf
do what you want
but this kind of shit will eat a hole in your intestines you dont deal with it
they pull up
milo exits the car pulls rudolph from the back
bobby leans out
hey why dont you come by the precinct tomorrow for our xmas bash
im not invited
im not a cop anymore remember
fuck that im inviting you
i dont know bob
im sorta busy
thats what im worried about
take it easy ok
bobby really seems worried but milo waves him off
bobby drives over parks by other cop cars
gets out mingles with some cops
laughter inside jokes
milo watches from afar
you should go to that party man
you need it
do i look like i need advice from a grown man in antlers
milo gags rudolph and drags him into the station
hazy pieces a tilting clock on the wall
a battered metal desk
filing cabinets spitting up papers
a man sid wound sorta tight milos best friend peers down at us youre drooling on my sofa
milo unsticks his face from the leather couch wobbles upright
are the walls throbbing or is it just him
you do have an apartment dont you
with a bed of some kind
sid hands him a coffee
heard you shut down th street yesterday
gave every kid in the county the gift of nightmares
hey im a giving kind of guy
anyway what do you care
i brought your guy in right
milo holds out his hand palm up
sid counts money into his swearing under his breath sid is trying to stuff a xmas tree into the back of a station wagon
at least half of the tree is hanging out of the back
milo drinks a beer and watches
you gonna give me a hand or just stand there killing your liver
is that a trick question
sid glares at him
milo sighs puts down his beer and grabs part of the tree
so i told her fine id handle xmas this year
i mean whats to handle
you buy a tree some gifts cook a ham hang some lights
an idiot could do it
well well soon find out
sid checks him out
you have plans for the holiday
gonna drink some cheap whiskey and put your fist through a wall
the tree is definitely not going to fit
they let it go and sid pulls out a small hand saw
then forget it
ive got an open bond but your thing sounds like more fun
ill give it to doug instead
sid starts hacking away at the tree
hold up heidi
what the fuck
i want the job im in the hole
youre always in the hole
whats your point
the truth is im not sure youre the right person for this job
it could be a total disaster
on the other hand when one friend sees another friend stagnating in his own filth he has to do something right
i just woke up
i was gonna shower
sid drops the saw
with one final shove the tree is in
sid slams the back shut
but remember you asked for it
he reaches into his pocket and extracts a folded piece of paper
hands it to milo
milo unfolds it gives it a quick look
a second look
are we done yet
is this a joke
because if it is im gonna have to kill you
its not a joke
she got arrested
and then she jumped bail
apparently the whole thing started with some reckless driving and ended with her assaulting a police officer
milo gives him a questioning look
she bit him
that sounds like her
but heres my question why the hell did you post her bail
hey i know she dumped you
she did not dump me
ok whatever i
no not whatever
i dumped her
the point is im aware you guys have issues but im running a business here
a person needs bail i dont have time to check with you first
well had you checked with me first you wouldnt be out of a bond right now
im not out of a bond if you go pick her up
its five grand to bring her back by am xmas day
youre telling me its five grand to go pick up my ex wife and bring her to jail
beat on xmas
youre a good listener
milo takes a deep calming breath
then he explodes into whoops and hollers
he throws himself into a snow bank and thrashes around
he does a fred astaire around a lamp post
i take it youre interested
milo grabs sid and pulls him into a crushing bear hug
i love you
youre the best friend a guy could ever have
ok take it easy
teresa mid s overly made up popping gum pokes her head out the front door sid you got a dui on line one
off their looks whats going on
milo drops sid grabs teresa and gives her a long intense kiss
he releases her
she stumbles back a bit
beat can i have my gum back
he reaches into his mouth extracts her gum and hands it to her
she retreats back inside
milo beams at sid
you know what this is dont you
you know how they say what goes around comes around
turns out its true
milo contd checking the paper that middle initial stands for rhonda by the way
she tells people it stands for rachel but thats a lie
sid shakes his head
i cant believe you guys broke up over a stupid article
we didnt break up over a stupid article
we broke up because she is a cheating manipulative liar
are you sure you can handle this
why wouldnt i be able to handle this
lets face it youre not exactly rational around her
i mean if i was a cop working a case and some reporter came snooping around id say no comment
not no comment but care for a cocktail
and then a month later running off to some love shack called cavemans cabin and tying the knot
who does that
thats not even close to what happened
for one thing it was called cupids cabin
and for another that was before i knew how conniving she was
now i know
so all i have to do is track her down cuff her up and bring her in
checking his watch and ive got what two days
easy as pie
famous last words
sid is regretting his decision as he watches milo go dancing down the street
with the sound of multiple ringing phones cut to
quick tracking shot of lorraine s bleached blond built like a trucker as she talks on the phone and paces the room giving us glimpses of a major illegal bookie
operation tv screens everywhere a huge blackboard posting odds men on computers several heavily armed private security guards
into phone you tell him i know where he lives
i know where his bimbo wife takes her yoga classes i know where his idiot son shoplifts after school so he can pay me my money or
she comes to a sudden stop at what the hell happened to you
reveal dwight the guy who tried to collect from milo milo boyd
fucker head butted me
not interested yeah
did you get the money
he did not
luck be a lady kicks in milo gets his car out of impound
milo gets a cut and a shave
milo gets his shoes shined
a freshly showered and shaved milo packs for the job singing at the top of his lungs
luck be a lady
he puts an empty duffle on the bed and starts filling it toooo
he stares at his collection and smiles to his weapons i told you this day would come
milo zips up the bag
milo tosses the duffle in the backseat
he pulls out the job sheet and inspects it
cass cell phone number is listed
pulls out his cell phone then hesitates
he glances around and sees a pay phone across the way
pockets his cell phone and crosses to the pay phone
cass expensive leather jacket boots dark glasses trying to be incognito
hurrying towards her car when she sees some cops exit a diner up ahead
she slips into a doorway waiting for them to pass when her phone rings
she checks it pay phone and answers jimmy
nope not jimmy
milo doesnt speak
cass listens for a moment
she can hear breathing
what the fuck
an evil grin crosses milos face
cass goes pale
milo takes a step forward
cass takes a step back
milo lunges and cass drops her phone and bolts out of frame
milo smirks at the receiver
you better run you crazy bitch
sid shuts his door then speaks into his phone low yeah
he took the job
but if this thing goes bad im blaming you
he hangs up
milo sips from a coffee cup and watches milos pov the front door of a fancy brownstone
a woman with a toy poodle emerges from the building struggling with the heavy door
milo appears next to the woman and holds the door for her nice dog
the woman exits and milo enters
milo stops in front of and knocks on the door
milo glances around then works the lock
milo slips inside pulling the door shut behind him
its dark and quiet
he glides through the room scoping it out
the place is huge white rug and couch flat screen tv
and lining the bookshelves are framed articles awards photos of cass with various public figures the home of a successful and dedicated journalist
milo is halfway across the room when he realizes he has left a set of muddy prints across the formerly pristine white rug
cass enters frame
nervous looks all around as she tries the knob
surprise the door swings open
over the couch etc
looks like milo had a little field day here
he is taking a closer look at the shelves no photos of a boyfriend family pets its all work
he picks up one of the framed articles with the headline ring
theres a photo of cass shaking hands with the an milos face clouds over
cass slips inside and the door swings shut behind her with a soft click
milos head whips around
someones in the kitchen
big grin as he replaces the frame and draws his gun
a couple careful steps across the room and a floorboard creaks
someones in the living room
grabs a heavy saucepan off the stove
grips it like a weapon soft foots it towards the hallway
milo reaches the hallway entrance
positions himself up against the wall waiting
cass tiptoes down the hallway saucepan at the ready
milo holds his breath
a shadowy figure steps into the room
milo puts his gun to their head allo love
cass takes a breath and lunges
the pan connects solidly with a cat
cat goes flying bounces off wall lands on the coffee table fangs bared
so if we didnt know already cass and milo are in different stewart is trying to explain himself to a skeptical milo poor liar so i heard a noise in
here and became concerned
ok the truth is she asked me to pick up her dry cleaning
milo just waits
ok ok look shes working a big story that was supposed to be mine and i want it back
milo considers this
you sleeping with her stu
turning red you mean like at this moment
yeah thats what i mean
are you sleeping with her at this very moment
we have a history yes
a history huh
snorting good luck with that
cass tries to coax the terrified cat out from under the sofa here kitty kitty
suddenly the landlady as wide as she is tall pops her head in the door startling cass aahh
youre not jimmy
recovering quickly oh
im looking for him
under the sofa
maybe you can help
im his girlfriend
thats my name
maybe i should call the cops
ok look jimmys in trouble
what kind of trouble
lower sex change trouble
sex change trouble
something like that
all i know is hes missing
ive had a lousy week too
my cousin linda fell off a cruise ship
a grown woman outta know how to swim
i hear ya
mind if i take a quick look around
the landlady thinks this over
jimmys behind on his rent
i bet his girlfriend would want to take care of that
on cass dammit
i bet she would
milo explains as he pokes around the thing is stu shell make you think shes interested in you when really all shes interested in is the case youre working on
because she wants to launch her big hot shot career
it is just dawning on stewart wait a second youre milo
she talks about you all the time
immediately interested really
oh yeah dude
she hates you
milo turns an angry red
oh she hates me
she says youre the most selfish immature stubborn
you know what
im not even gonna dignify this with
hey man im on your team
no youre not geraldo
i dont allow reporters on my team
milo tosses some papers around on her desk furiously
and for the record im the one who hates her
just so thats clear
he picks up the phone and checks the last dialed number it comes up caesars casino
to himself that figures
run home to mommy
milo erases the number then heads for the door
well nice meeting ya stu
wait where are you going
im going to pick up your girlfriend
but dont worry if she ever gets out of jail im sure youll be very happy together
stewart hurries to the phone and checks it but milo erased the number
stewart races to the window
cass is about to give up when she spots peeking out from the bookshelf a plain envelope marked cassidy daley
she slips the envelope into her pocket just as the landlady appears times up
not a thing
dont worry hon
he probably just went away for the holidays
the sun sparkles off the casino windows
it looks fun
a great place for the holidays
its jimmy being dangled off a th floor balcony by mahler who barely breaks a sweat
ok ok i told one person about the xmas eve job but she doesnt even have all the details i swear
mahler lets go of one of jimmys feet
now jimmy is hanging by one ankle
he starts to scream again
gimme a name
milo gets in on the phone with sid and this loser shes dating looks like he buys his clothes from kmart
sid is at home trying to get the hacked up xmas tree to stand up straight
his and year old sons beat on each other in the background
why do you care
i just think its funny
listen to me you guys made a terrible couple
i know that
you dont have to tell me that
relationships arent about competition theyre about compromise
you mean like when your wife wants to do one thing and you want to do another and you compromise by doing what she wants
now just get her here
cause i cant afford to lose this bond
in fact i already know where she is and im gonna go pick her up right now
the cadillac pulls away from the curb
stewart pulls into traffic following the cadillac
the cadillac on route to atlantic city the hyundai not far behind
ex cop current bounty hunter
ray small wiry slightly demented looking reads from his laptop while lorraine paces behind him swinging a golf club
lives in jersey city drives a caddy
been in the hole on and off with us the past years
we checked his place his hangouts no luck
this is no good
we let this guy slide suddenly everybody thinks hey its the holidays
all debts are cancelled
get the word out i want this guy brought here so he can pay what he owes us dwight can break something of his and we can all enjoy our
ray nods and picks up the phone
a half mile away at caesars milo is pulling into the crowded parking lot
milo exits his car and heads inside
stewart feeling super sly pulls up to a space near milos car but another car slips into the spot
thats my space you asshole
milo knocks on the door
a woman in heavy makeup lois cass mother opens the door takes one look at milo slams the door shut
after a moment lois opens it again
happy to see you too
how dare you
after what you did to my baby
lois bursts into tears and collapses into milos arms
what say we do this inside
men running around in gowns and feather boas
a completely recovered lois sits by a make up mirror adjusting a wig
stuck to her mirror is a photo of milo and cass arms around each other smiling
milo gives the photo a dirty look
what happened to the pirate show
i got sick of it
now im a female impersonator
you are female
thats why im so good at it
help me with this
she stands and wiggles into an evening gown
milo struggles with the zipper
where is she lois
i need to talk to her
oh milo where did it all go wrong
do you have any idea what it means to waste a womans child bearing years
every month her eggs are jumping out of her ovaries like sailors abandoning a sinking ship
i mean i know you were mad about that article
i wasnt mad about that article
in fact what article
listen to me milo cassidy may be a strong independent woman on the outside but on the inside shes just a girl who wants to be protected and loved by
what happened between the two of you devastated her
devastated her right to the top
she has done well hasnt she
lois contd i must admit it makes me proud to think that my little girl whose only friend growing up was an imaginary orphan with a tin leg named leslie
now gets invited to tour the white house
milos jaw hits the floor
she got to tour the white house
now he really wants to take cass to jail
tell me where she is lois
oh who knows
she was running around like a chicken with its head cut off said she was on the biggest story of her career
said she was going somewhere to think
milo thinks this over then a grin breaks out on his face
stewart has finally found a parking space and is exiting his car when he sees milo come out and jump into the cadillac
stewart hurries back into his car
stands mobbed with people horses galloping down the track dust rising in their wake
moving in on
surrounded by people cheering cass is hard at work
notebook open phone to ear lap holding the plain envelope ripped open contents exposed a piece of paper that says atlantic she has underlined sparrow and made a list persons
into phone no one with that name
what about a casino
she clicks over to an incoming call private caller jimmy
stewart at the mobbed track entrance lost and frustrated no whos jimmy
look stewart im busy
casually where are you by the way
i mean exactly
im in miami if you must know
im on the beach building a sand castle and drinking from a coconut
someone taps her shoulder
she glances up and sees milo sitting right next to her grinning
she slowly closes her phone not bothering to say goodbye
a million different emotions cross cass face
surprise anger anxiousness
all the mixed emotions you have when you suddenly run into the man who broke your heart
fancy meeting you here
strange charged moment as they look at each other
then they have a casual contest
how are you
cant hold out anymore what are you doing here
building a sand castle drinking from a coconut
man once a liar always a liar
cass immediately stands
you know what
i dont have time for this im working
she grabs her stuff
milo blocks her with his leg
hey me too
move your leg
milo doesnt budge
spelling it out for her what i do is i track down criminals
people who jumped bail
idiots who decided to go on the run after biting police officers
i find them and i take them to jail
cass stares at him eyes wide now hold on just a second milo
tell you what ill give you more than a second
ill give you
for old times sake
milo moves his leg kicks back starts to count
cass stares at him her jaw working trying to decide what to do
then all of a sudden she bolts
the cass jumps into her car and turns the key
she tries again then hears soft laughter
milo is several yards away strike one
cass leaps from the car and runs
cass runs for the elevator
it opens and people exit strike two
cass turns heel and bolts
cass races out flagging a taxi
milo pulls up strike three
im not going to jail milo
i beg to differ
she heads for the cabs
milo exits his car gun in hand
like youre gonna shoot me
loudly im gonna shoot a cab driver
head whip around in his direction
then every cab in the place goes off duty
cass stomps her foot furious
cass marches back over to milo
ok look lets talk about this
with that milo sweeps her up into his arms
and they find cass stares at milo
is he gonna kiss her
again she feels weird
listen milo im not sure we should
suddenly milo dumps her in the trunk of his car
hey wait a minute
he smiles at her waves then slams down the lid
cut to black
well now she knows exactly how she feels bastard
and immediately a phone rings
a match is struck illuminating the trunk as cass scrambles for her phone
trying to sound professional cassidy daley
close on jimmy head tilted back tense smile on his face
pull back a little to reveal the gun mahler is holding under its me
exhaling with relief shit jimmy i thought you were dead
dont be silly
hurrying on listen you didnt happen to go to my place and find that envelope i left did you
i did but i dont really get it whats sparrow
it doesnt matter
did you tell anyone else about this story

you think i want to share a story like this
cause the truth is there is no story

this story is way too good
mahler nudges jimmy
where are you
im at the atlantic city boardwalk

more importantly where are you
on cass she stares at her phone
uh oh jimmy
suddenly music kicks in and we hear milo singing at the top deck the halls with boughs of holly fa la la la laaaa
now milo really is the happiest man alive
he pulls out his cell phone dials teresa removes her gum sticks it on her mouse pad answers sids bail bonds
guess whos in my trunk
is that some sort of perverted innuendo
who is this
aw come on teresa you know its me

sids busy shopping

ok just tell him i got her and ill be back in hours

dont be such a pessimist
you still have time
his phone beeps
its cass calling from the trunk
i got another call
he clicks over
tinas thai massage
where every ending is a happy one
cass rolls her eyes
let me out of the trunk
by the way your boyfriend stewarts been following me
unfortunately i had to ditch him at the track
why is stewart
realizing and wait who said hes my boyfriend
aw dont be embarrassed
these things happen
you were drunk when you guys hooked up right
cass turns bright red
she was drunk when they hooked up
changing tactics she tries to flatter him
you know what milo
i shouldnt have run from you like that
i dont know
you caught me off guard
the truth is im kind of in some trouble and i could really use your help
bad news for you then
i wouldnt help you if you were the very last baby sea turtle in the world dragging its tiny weak body across the burning hot sand while sea gulls circled
id just pull up a chair sip a pina colada and let nature take its course
suddenly cass starts to sob
loud hysterical sobs
milo listens for a moment out of a purely clinical interest then hey i used to be a sucker but no more
you can cry til the cows come home for all i care
cass instantly stops crying and slams her phone shut
cut to black
then the sound of a trunk opening and we are mahler reaches into his trunk and removes his handgun
checks the cartridge pockets the gun
slams the trunk shut
he climbs into his front seat and as he pulls out of the lot we see cass newspaper photo that has been ripped from the paper on the passenger seat
milo drives along happily humming when suddenly a small trail of smoke drifts over his shoulder
what the hell
he glances into the rearview mirror and holy shit
calling out hey um cass
no response cassidy
milo jerks the car to the right and slams on the brakes
the car screeches to a halt on the embankment
milo leaps out of the drivers door and races to back fumbling with his keys
smoke continues to pour out of the trunk
its ok hang on im coming
gets the key in pops the lid and sees cass handkerchief over her nose pack of flaming matches in hand
cass tosses the matches and handkerchief and punches milo in the balls
milo groans and crumbles to the ground
cass jumps out of the trunk and stands over him you know something milo
youre one of the most gullible
bam milo grabs her ankle and jerks and cass hits the ground
next thing you know its wwf time the two of them rolling milo gets her pinned but cass grabs his ear and twists he pulls her arm behind her back
ow ow ow
and she jerks her head back smacking him in the nose
son of a
he gets her in a bear hug
and she bites him
finally he has her on her back trapped
he gets his face right over hers and starts to let a glob of saliva fall from noooo
uncle uncle uncle
milo collapses onto the ground next to her laughing
she looks at him and she starts laughing too
im the dirty fighter
they both laugh harder
then milo stands and offers her a hand
she takes it and he helps her up
awkward pause as they look at each other
i dont know
hug or something
what the hell
he opens his arms
she moves closer
milo feels her hands moving towards the gun in his belt
i had to try right
get in the car
they are driving along both a little dishevelled one of cass hands cuffed to the passenger door
they pass casinos as they head out of atlantic city
your windshields cracked
thanks captain obvious
cass turns to inspect him more closely
and you look like shit milo
what have you been doing sleeping on the floor
milo has been sleeping on the floor
i enjoy sleeping on the floor
matter of fact i love sleeping on the floor
i love everything about my life
great job good friends hot girlfriend
you have a girlfriend
he does not yes i do
cass is skeptical really
whats her name
the first name that pops into his head teresa
rocking hot body
likes to cook pasta for me and perform strip teases
is she missing a chromosome
oh she has all her chromosomes believe you me
cass thinks this over then counters well my life is great too
i can tell
you and stewart make a great couple by the way
you and me made a terrible couple
but you two
like peas in a pod
about to deny that she and stewart are a couple it occurs to cass milo seems a little jealous
she jumps on this
you know what i like about stewart
i cant imagine
hes not you
not even on his best day
or his worst
ill bet he has a lot of those
still betting huh
you cant win if you dont play
or in your case even if you do
he shoots her a sharp look
she stares back waiting
i win all the time
i hadnt noticed
that is definitely a challenge
you know what
seeing as how im about to come into five grand
milo makes a sudden turn off the highway and pulls into the parking lot of ballys casino
i think ill do a little betting right now
dont you have to take me back
i have two days
a monkey could get you back in two days
again famous last words
milo exits the car
cass smiles to herself
this is obviously what she hoped would happen
she glances around spots the duffle in the back seat
peeking out of the top of the duffle is the taser gun
milo opens her door
arent you afraid ill get away
he uncuffs her from the door cuffs her to his own wrist
stewart is heading back to the city cursing his bad luck when he happens to glance over and see milo and cass heading damn im good
he makes a quick turn off the highway and into the ballys parking lot
the clerk at the chips cage recognizes milo as he and cass merry xmas mr boyd
behind the clerk a female clerk perks up at this name
what a nice surprise
lets hope your luck is better today
milo glances at cass
sure if theres such a thing as better than great which is how my luck has been lately
while the clerk is counting out chips we notice behind him lorraine on the phone listening intently
then she hangs up grinning
the idiot just showed up at ballys
im on it
calling out ray
ray appears next to her
go get this asshole
ray cracks his knuckles smirks at dwight and exits
milo sits at a blackjack table pulling cass into a seat next to him
prepare to observe the master
he bets while cass sits next to him scheming ok how about this she uses her free hand to pull out her wallet if i give you all the cash
in my wallet will you let me go
he takes the cash from her and thinks for a moment
milo adds her cash to his bet on the table
to the dealer hit me
id really like to
the dealer deals the cards
nice going master
milo quickly lays out some more money
a waitress smells like an ashtray appears and for the couple over here
were not a couple
just as quick why would you think we were a couple
we used to be together
back when i was young and foolish
and i was confused
and i was slumming
and i was drunk
the waitress looks back and forth between them
i have to get back to work now
the waitress rolls her eyes and leaves
milo turns to see he has lost more money
under his breath son of a bitch
cass has had enough of this
she leans closer look milo the truth is
my mom is in the hospital
milo perks up
old lois not feeling up to par
she might be really sick
thats why i had to jump bail
overly sincere taking care of her huh
putting aside your career for a loved one
golly thats so you
cass stares at him realizing youve already been to see her
no wonder you got all those awards
so lemme guess the real reason you jumped bail is cause youre on a story
cass narrows her eyes stewart
stewart told you
i would have figured it out on my own trust me
i wouldnt trust you if you were the last man alive
you think about that much
me being the last man alive
am i naked in this fantasy
cass takes a deep breath
this is getting her nowhere
but she is clearly hesitant to give him the real story
ok youre right
im on a story
a very important story
it just so happens that im possibly about to uncover a whole ring of dirty cops
isnt the whole dirty cop thing kind of old
maybe you should do a story about something people are interested in
like internet porn
im serious milo
this is gonna be big
and heres what im willing to do magnanimous im willing to credit you in the article
oh sure like you credited me in the th street article
cass stares at him
why on earth would i have credited you
i worked my ass off for that story
thats one way of putting it
whats that supposed to mean
i dont want to be in your article
in fact i would rather eat a bowl of broken glass than have my name in any way associated with one of your lousy articles
forget i mentioned it
i already have
i mean youre not a cop anymore right
what do you care if people were murdered
nobody was murdered
just my source
bullet to the back of the head
dumped in a reservoir
i dont know
ok ok maybe he wasnt murdered yet
but i wouldnt be surprised if
milo breaks out into loud guffaws
cass is furious
maybe this whole thing sounds like no big deal to you
you know what it sounds like
it sounds like youre going to jail
cass cant believe this
milo listen you have to believe me come on you know me
getting red exactly
i do know you
which means i know you are a deceptive cold hearted bitch who is going to jail where she belongs
that was pretty harsh
cass looks at him stunned
they stare at each other in silence
the waitress arrives with the drinks champagne
what are we celebrating
i have to use the bathroom
stewart taps his steering wheel restlessly watching the door of the casino for signs of cass and milo
waiting in this parking lot is boring
finally he exits his car
sidles over to milos car
checks the door handle
stewart glances around then climbs in
cass enters and milo follows can i have some privacy please
milo checks the room
looks like there is no escape from here
he uncuffs her but then im gonna have to frisk you
get it over with then
milo checks her pockets
he goes behind her and checks her shoulders
he reaches around and checks her belly
you gain a little weight
snapping back you lose a little hair
milo reaches higher and yeah
im hiding a weapon in my breasts
milo backs off turning red
make it quick
as soon as he is gone cass pulls milos taser gun stewart is rummaging around inside milos car when he looks up and sees ray standing there smiling at him
shit man you startled me
beat can i help you
suddenly ray grabs stewarts head and smashes it into the milo checks his watch then raps on the door
you almost done in there
cass squints at the taser gun trying to read the tiny instruction label on the side put open end in direct contact with skin
ok thats long enough im coming in
he comes in and she jams the taser gun into his neck and hits sorry
and keeps going
she hurries to the curb and tries to flag down a ride
staring after her
mahler compares her to the newspaper photo he is holding
yup thats her
cass glances around keeping an eye out for milo and spots mahler staring at her
suddenly he starts heading towards her
cass backs up slightly nervous
who is that guy
need a lift
cass looks around
a trucker has pulled up next to her
relieved she quickly climbs on board
rack to mahler watching the truck pull away
he doesnt seem worried
he turns and heads for his car
cass is fixing her hair pulling herself together
he says we made a terrible couple
which is true
i know that
im the one who thought that first
im the one who came up with that
the fact is i dont want to be with someone who cant admit he was wrong
so youre available
cass looks at him
he smiles coyly
available for what
i have a waterbed in my trailer
i hope you dont think youre telling me something that interests me
you know what i want for xmas
the driver mouths something at her we cant see
cass leans over and smacks him as hard as she can
the truck screeches to a halt by the side of the road
cass gets booted out the passenger door
the door is slammed shut behind her
cass gives the guy the finger as he drives off
she turns to see a car headed her way
she starts flagging it down
yup its milo
she looks around but wheres she gonna go
meanwhile as milo nears he seems to be speeding up
he keeps coming an evil look on his face
it looks like he is going to run her over
she turns and starts to run
milo is laughing
you better run
cass runs into a field
milo drives off the road and follows
he gets her cornered by a pen
he looks triumphant
then she throws open the pen revealing a huge bull
now she looks triumphant
hey its locked
open the door you son of a bitch
finally milo opens it
she dives into the car and slams the door just before the bull rams into the side of the car
cass and milo watch stunned as the bull looks at them for a moment then topples over unconscious
milo and cass hear a strange sound and look over to see a small herd of bulls uh oh
lorraine waves dwight over
rays got something to show you
ray throws open the bathroom door to reveal a very disgruntled stewart handcuffed to the toilet
stewart blinks up at them disoriented
lorraine hands dwight the golf club
pick something and break it
whoa wait just a minute
you know i do feel better
beat who is this guy anyway
lorraine and ray stare at him
thats not milo boyd
he was in milo boyds cadillac
they all look at stewart who moans in pain
both of you go this time and make sure you get the right guy
i dont have time for this shit
what about me
lorraine considers him for a moment then slams the bathroom door in his face
milo and cass are back on the highway both looking a little worse for wear
milos nose is swollen cass clothes are muddy
milo moves his weapons from the duffle into his own jacket while he drives
he smirks at cass
noting all the weapons wow
you were gonna use all that stuff on me
a guy can dream cant he
now his jacket is full of weapons
he turns his attention back to the road
cass studies his profile
ok look milo lets just clear the air ok
so maybe it was a mistake thinking we could be involved while working on the same case
hey i know it was a mistake
dont think youre telling me something i dont know cause youre not
deep breath ok
but can we just put aside our differences for two seconds
because back at the casino i think i saw someone following me
sure that wasnt me
i dont think so
this guy was lacking your trademark smell of booze and kfc
milo surreptitiously sniffs himself
if these dirty cops have my source hostage somewhere
milo starts to laugh
cass flushes whats so funny
you think dirty cops are trying to kill you
look i know you think youre hot shit and everything but im pretty sure the only one around here who might want to kill you is me
cass sees a dark chevy in the rearview mirror gets a look at the driver and goes pale
the guy i saw back at the casino
milo glances into the mirror checking the guy out
he doesnt look like a cop to me
freaking out speed up
would you just calm down for a second and
cass kicks a leg over and slams her foot onto the gas
the car leaps forward
milo tries to push her foot off the gas while they wrestle for the wheel
the car does a crazy zig zag back and forth
she points past him
milo turns to see mahler driving beside they both duck as mahler starts firing
glass shatters all around them
milo pulls out his gun and starts firing back
cass is hunched over in the passenger seat excited and frightened at the same time
mahler pulls alongside them again and milo wrenches the wheel to the left slamming the cadillac into mahlers car
mahlers car goes skidding across the road hits a ditch and the cadillac speeds away leaving mahlers car behind
the cadillac is parked on the shoulder milo changing the tire cass standing by the passenger door still handcuffed
i told you they were trying to kill me
yeah well no ones killing you until i get you to jail
cass whips her head around to look at him youre still taking me to jail
but its the cops who are after me
first of all that guy was not a cop
second of all we just left him unconscious in a ditch
youll be fine
this is important
this is my job
pointing between them is my job
milo you dont understand whats going on
milo rolls his eyes and straightens up
ill lay it out for you some loser with a minor sheet calls you up and says hey ive got a big story for you you interested
itll only cost you a couple hundred bucks and ill tip you onto some criminal activity its your chance to expose some bad guys and write the story of your
then the moron gets himself caught hes probably in cold storage somewhere and now you think the bad guys are after you
i get it
i just dont care
milo finishes with the tire throws the jack in the back and heads back around to the drivers seat
cass watches him closely getting an idea
she reaches into her pocket and pulls out the paper from jimmy
if only i knew exactly when and where this deal was going down
course if i cant figure out that part then you definitely cant figure out that part because we both know im much smarter than you
milo flinches then forces a laugh
my brain can dance circles around your brain
i dont even know what that means
guess well never know
then decides fuck it
he strides around the car and snatches the paper from her hand
he reads atlantic city
i knew you couldnt figure it out
its a business
i dont think so
what kind of strip bars have you been going to anyway
milo stares at the paper wracking his brain
cass sighs loudly and snatches the paper back
oh well forget it i knew you couldnt do it
i could crack that story and still get you to jail on time
cass stares him in the eye and says the magic words wanna bet
milo stares at her
she stares back
milos face is red
he clenches his fists
he unclenches them
he thrusts out his hand youre on
i have to make a call
he starts to walk away
arent you going to uncuff me
you going somewhere
then you dont need to be uncuffed
cass sits in the passenger seat and watches in the rearview mirror while milo paces behind the car on the phone
to herself asshole
milo is talking to sid so theres just gonna be a little delay
sids at the mall
on dec rd
with all the other desperate last minute shoppers
in other words hes in hell
i dont get it
why are you helping her
but thats the beauty of it sid im not helping her she only thinks im helping her
if youre not helping her what are you doing
milo notices cass watching him and turns his back slightly
cass narrows her eyes to herself what is he up to
milo is making this up as he goes along
ill tell you what im doing im gonna crack this case first and im gonna take all the credit
who knows maybe ill even get my job back
you are so full of shit
you dont want your job back
you just want to prove youre smarter than she is
instantly heated i am smarter than she is
i would have cracked that th street case way before she did if she hadnt
cheated right i know youve told me a million times
did it ever occur to you that a normal couple wouldnt compete the way you guys do in the first place
sid spots what he is looking for
so does another last minute shopper
they both reach for the toy
this from the man currently trying to prove to his wife he can handle xmas
instantly heated i can handle xmas
sid wrenches the toy from the other shopper
trust me ok
do i have a choice
milo hangs up and gets in the car
the cadillac pulls a u turn and heads back towards atlantic so
milo buys a chili dog while talking to cass who stands next to him handcuffed
so what exactly are these dirty cops supposed to be doing
stealing evidence from property rooms
then destroying it for the right price
its a good idea
if it werent you know
your plan is to catch them red handed before they can destroy the evidence then write an expose for the paper and win yourself another big award
something like that
only you dont know what sparrow is
thinking could be a nickname
or the place where the evidence is stashed
or a code word of some kind
but the guy who knows has gone missing and you think the dirty cops got a hold of him
when jimmy called earlier someone else was there
and they disconnected the call
milo is staring at her
so we find your source we find the dirty cops
gimme your phone
she hands it to him
milo checks the record of incoming calls and smiles
bobby talks into his cell phone while supervising a parade of hookers being loaded into a van heres one why did the snowman pull down his pants
cause he heard the snowblower was coming
listen bob i need a favor
i need an address to go with a phone number
but i need it asap
kinda got a guy on my tail
a tow truck is pulling up towing mahlers car
the tow truck driver turns to mahler who is in the passenger seat the garage is closed for the night
guess youll have to wait til tomorrow
mahler thinks this over then smacks the driver across the face with the butt of his gun
the driver crumples in his seat
mahler leans across him opens the drivers side door and boots him out of the cab
the tow truck is driving away from the garage
milo climbs back into the car holding a piece of paper with the words trump casino room on it
he grins at cass
pretty proud of yourself ey
youre a reporter
but i used to be a cop
lets face it im naturally gonna be one step ahead of you
under her breath you werent last time
milo whips his head around what did you say
i said youre doing a great job
the trump casino on the strip coming into view
milo pulls into the crowded parking lot and checks the cartridge of his gun
beside him cass is bubbling over with excited energy
ok heres what i think we should do ill go up first jimmy knows me so if anythings wrong im sure hell give me a sign
oh except youre staying in the car
milo exits the car
shouting after him but
its my story
but he is already headed for the casino entrance
he waves at her and disappears inside
milo glides through the casino past the blinking lights of the slot machines headed for the elevators
a drunk guy in a hawaiian shirt is coming towards him and he and milo steadying the guy you ok
watch where youre going
under his breath prick
the drunk guy continues past
milo holds up the room card key calling after him merry xmas to you too
the elevator dings and milo exits
he turns a corner and heads down the hall
another elevator dings behind him
milo continues down the hall
suddenly he stops and looks behind him
no one is there
he turns another corner and finds
there is a do not disturb sign on the door
he goes past it and taps lightly room service
he glances down the hall and sees a slight movement
someone is watching him
he moves away from the door continues down the hall then slips into the ice milo hits the light switch off and waits just inside the door
someone steps in and milo grabs them and throws them against the wall
the person screams
milo slaps a hand across the persons mouth and switches on the light
and finds himself face to face with what the
he looks at the handcuff dangling from her wrist still loud whisper what the hell are you doing
its my story i dont break stories by staying in the car
yeah well re the armrest youre paying for that
heres a nickle
suddenly milo goes still
there is a creaking sound as someone creeps down the hall
milo puts a finger to cass lips
then he peeks out the door
hall by the maid
the maid stops by a room and enters
to cass play along
milo passes the maids cart glancing at her room record sheet then continues on to room
he uses the card he swiped on the door
of course it doesnt work
son of a bitch
the maid peeks out into the hall
to cass this is like the third card theyve given me
playing along take it easy honey
dont tell me to take it easy now we have to go all the way downstairs again
cass looks pleadingly at the maid
whats the name
the maid checks her chart then crosses the hall and uses her youre an angel
milo and cass go inside
milo closes the door carefully behind them then tiptoes across the room to the connecting door cass close on his heels
all is silent
wait a second wheres my gun
i dont know
where is your gun
i dont have one
then youve answered your own question
milo tiptoes closer to the door
cass pulls on his sleeve
come on give me something
youve got like a million weapons in the jacket
she reaches for his jacket and milo pulls away
these are not toys
you cant just give them to someone and have them know how to use them
i seem to remember doing just fine with your taser gun
they are at the door
milo puts a finger to his lips and tries the doorknob locked
he is about to work the lock when no time to do this quietly
milo takes a step back then halfway down the hallway the maid hears the door being kicked in
nervous she backs away headed for the elevators
milo quickly enters the room gun raised
the screaming is coming from the tv
milo clicks it off and checks the room
the place appears to be deserted
he crosses to the bathroom and peers in empty
meanwhile cass has cautiously entered the room and sees spots on the rug oh god is that blood
wait by the door
im just trying to
this could be a crime scene
there are clues all over this room that only a trained eye can find
and as i seem to recall you were the one who was unable to figure this out by herself
cass grits her teeth
under her breath he is unbelievable
who are you talking to your imaginary friend leslie
lots of kids have imaginary friends despite what my mother believes
you wait by the door
and ill handle this
she moves back to the door
as she does she notices a matchbook on the floor its a green matchbook with a black so youre saying you dont want my help
im saying i dont need your help
as he turns away she slips the matchbook into her purse
milo catches this movement out of the corner of his eye and glances back what was that
what was what
did you find something
how could i find anything
im not the detective
lemme see your purse
milo takes a step closer to her but cass and milo turn to see a hotel security guard in the doorway excitedly pointing his gun at them
milo rolls his eyes
stay where you are
ok ok no problem
youre probably gonna want this
milo holds up his gun
take it easy
im just gonna unload it
milo drops the cartridge then tosses the gun right at the
the guard instinctively raises his hands and milo charges him tackling him to the ground then handcuffing him to the table
milo grabs cass hand and races from the room
cass and milo run up to the elevators
all cars are rising back up is on the way
milo hits the fire alarm and pulls cass into the stairwell
milo and cass are almost to the bottom when security appears in the stairwell beneath them
milo looks up
security is coming from above as well
milo cracks the stairwell window and peers out they are stories up
youre gonna have to jump
milo considers this then picks her up and tosses her out the cass screams as she falls
milo falls next to her
they fall and fall and boosh they land in a snow bank and tumble to seconds later they are on their feet running for the car
ok so some guy youre looking for has disappeared
you want me to put out an all points on him
milo and cass are speeding away from the trump casino
into phone the thing is bob cass thinks dirty cops might be involved
bobby is in his office
his door opens onto the squad room busy with police activity
bobby sits up straighter in his chair
whoa whoa whoa
youre with cassidy
shit milo you know when youre around her your brain turns to mush
yeah well that doesnt change the fact that someone took a couple shots at us
you get a plate number
happened too quick
but it was a dark door chevy blue or grey new jersey plates and the car was wrecked i know that
bobby thinks this over
lemme look into it
see what i can find
just hold tight ok
milo checks his watch
but were kinda on a clock here
milo dont fuck around with this
if there are dirty cops in the house we all have a problem
so do me a favor get off the strip find somewhere to lie low and wait for my call
the scene has calmed down a little
a dark sedan appears and ray and dwight exit the car looking like a an ugly dangerous odd couple
an employee slips out the back door and hands ray a photo dwight snatches the photo from ray
yeah thats him
whos the chick
who gives a fuck
anyway they cant be far
they arent too far
they are a luxurious romantic b b
xmas lights winking on the trees come all ye faithful gently wafting out the oak front door
the whole scene looks beautiful peaceful romantic
kill me now
pull back to reveal milo and cass parked in front
reveal the sign next to them welcome to cupids cabin
the place milo and cass ran off to and got married years ago
im sorry its the only place i know off the strip
im not going in
what if they remember us
they wont remember us
why would they remember us
try to act normal
a small family run luxury bed and breakfast
the kind of place that prides itself on its service
dawn long graying hair glasses moccasins greets them with a smile can i help you
realizing wait it cant be
she looks behind her at a bulletin board
at photos of all the happy couples who have passed through her
and finds a to the back room edmund come quick
a balding man in flannel comes out takes one look and clasps both hands to his chest
be still my beating heart
looks like they remember us
what a lovely surprise
its been what years
milo and cass both try to downplay has it
i dont really remember
and you came back
to celebrate your anniversary
what an honor for us
actually were not
you know what
in light of this special special occasion its on the house
before cass can protest more milo grabs her arm
can i talk to you
he pulls her slightly aside
you have any money
no as you recall i gave you all my money at the blackjack table
realizing you blew all the money
i would have won it back if someone hadnt tasered me in the bathroom
use a credit card
lemme have yours
mines maxd too
off his look what i like to shop
they give each other a horrified look as they both realize what this means
then they turn back to the couple put their arms around each other and smile its our third anniversary
milo and cass snuggle closer
he surreptitiously squeezes her ass
she surreptitiously stomps on his foot
full of couples in love
young couples old couples gay couples straight couples
even a dog couple snuggled up by the fire
and then theres milo and cass bruised and dishevelled being served an elaborate romantic meal
they smile uncomfortably as edmund arrives with a tray of oysters to begin a little aphrodisiac
he gives them both a broad wink
so tell me how have you managed to keep the romance alive all this time
well ill tell you edmund
the secret to our success is that the little woman here knows her place
she cleans for me cooks for me and every night when i come home she gets down on her knees and massages my feet
he beams at cass
cass grins through her teeth
yes edmund its true
i massage his feet to help him feel like a man
its important especially when your husband has such a teeny tiny
just then dawn hustles over interrupting
how is everything
is it like that magical night years ago
this calls for a toast
she raises a glass tapping it with a spoon
milo and cass both groan under their breath
to the room may i have your attention please
edmund and i would like to share with you the most romantic moment we have ever seen
it was three years ago today in this very restaurant when this lovely young man here right in the middle of the meal threw down his napkin got down on
one knee and said marry me right now right this second i want to go to sleep tonight knowing youre my wife
jumping in and she said yes with tears in her eyes and a tremble in her hand lets get married and they ran out to the all night chapel and
came back an hour later man and wife
the whole restaurant starts clapping
milo turns to edmund can i get a whiskey
make that two
milo and cass stumble down the hall laughing hysterically falling down drunk
after we broke up i was so mad at you i told everyone i know you have herpes
i told everyone you flunked out of rd grade
i told everyone you have a moustache
i told everyone you like to wear my panties
this one is obviously true
both laugh harder
milo and cass stagger in blinking hazily at their new surroundings
a heart shaped bed
a bubble bath
like cupid threw up in here
the laughter slowly fades
this would be really awkward if we still had feelings for each other
which we dont
luckily were different people now
we dont feel the way we used to
weve moved on
we have no feelings about each other whatsoever
just two people who used to know each other
two casual acquaintances
feels good doesnt it
a platonic relationship
helping each other
trusting each other
which reminds them they dont trust each other
mind if i shower
cass disappears into the bathroom closing the door behind her
then milo hurries over to the door and listens
cass is pressed on her side of the door also listening
she reaches over and turns on the shower
as soon as milo hears the water he hurries over to the bed cass is seated on the toilet lid hunched over her phone hey
mom is at a gay bar having a cocktail
no not sheryl
beat your daughter
jesus christ where the hell are ya niagara falls
youre not gonna believe this but im at cupids cabin with milo
oh my god
i always knew you two would
were not back together
why the hell not
milo is looking through cass purse
he knows she was hiding something from him at the casino
while searching through her wallet he suddenly stumbles across a wedding photo of huh
he glances at the bathroom door
she carries their wedding photo around
cass listens while mom rants
i mean i just dont get it youre in this romantic place you have a perfect opportunity to win him back
why should i have to win him back
he should have to win me back
and who says i want him back anyway
i have never understood this competitive streak of yours
losing her patience look the reason i called i remember you worked at this one place where they had these bright green matches with like this silhouette of a horse
immediately defensive that was a long time ago
and all i did was serve drinks
i just need to know the name of the place
and ok i admit maybe i did a little dancing but how often do you make an hour in tips
i gotta go
i want grandkids
cass hangs up
she sits for a moment staring at her phone
is her mother right
is she making a mistake right now
she looks around the bathroom
candles flowers thick robes
a bottle of champagne chilling by the heart shaped tub
she slowly stands and checks herself out in the mirror brushing back her hair with her hands
suddenly on impulse she grabs the bottle of champagne and two glasses
what the hell why not
theyre here maybe they should seize the moment
she peeks out the bathroom door and sees
to himself sneaky bitch
cass is disappointed and vindicated all at once
she puts the champagne back
to herself sneaky bastard
milo hears the water go off
he pockets the matches tosses the purse away and lies on the bed striking a casual pose
you know whats great
trusting each other
he holds up the handcuffs time for bed
music kicks in silent night
suddenly cass eyes snap open
she sits up a little and glances over at milos night table where he left the keys and gun in plain view
cass is doing a slow careful acrobatic climb across milos body in an attempt to reach the gun without waking milo up
she puts a hand on the headboard
she is lifting her knee over him when he stirs
she freezes waiting for him to settle
its like playing twister only if the person youre playing with finds out she manages to get herself straddling him arms stretched the gun almost within reach when excuse me
what are you doing
she looks down
milo is watching her wide awake
this is going to be a tough one to explain
are you trying to seduce me
yes i am
she tries to reach for the gun while they talk
i didnt know you were still so attracted to me
i mean i remember how you used to like to greet me at the door in nothing but a
yes its true im still attracted to you
her hand is groping around blindly where the fuck is it
she stretches more bringing her face even closer to milos
thats great news
you know what would be really sexy right now
if we both just went to sleep
if you talked dirty to me
the gun seems to be getting father away
their lips are ok
in a sexy voice sewage
no i mean tell me about your attraction to me
i cant stop thinking about you
what part of me
all of you
cass blushes fiercely
if she didnt want that gun so bad
my great hair
something lower like
he reaches down and whips out
the gun is in his hand
thats why she couldnt reach it
he knew what she was up to this whole time
she flips off him and back onto her side
milo sits up flipping on the lights
i knew i couldnt trust you
i knew i couldnt trust you

when were you gonna tell me you have no intention of helping me with my story
im not helping you

by cracking this case before you then taking you in so you can spend this xmas in jail all alone
he rolls over turning his back to her
cass stares at the ceiling fuming
a strip club on the boardwalk
moving in on the back door
jimmy tied to a chair watches nervously as mahler takes so this is your place huh
probably more fun to sit where you can actually see the dancers but
mahler has all the boxes loaded up
he grabs a rag and approaches jimmy
hey listen no need for that i swear ill be as quiet as a mouse
mahler gags him then punches him in the face
jimmy slumps i know you will
mahler grabs the dolly flicks off the lights and exits out cass is in a booth handcuffed her mouth set her face grim
no more mr nice guy
she is scheming her way out
keeping one eye on cass im just curious
teresa at her desk sipping eggnog
no i do not keep my exs photo in my wallet
sid passes through kids in tow and carrying a huge tangled ball of xmas lights
sid looks like he wants to put a bullet through his brain
teresa mouths milo
sid picks up the other extension
whats the problem now
she keeps their wedding photo in her wallet
he wants to know what that means
it means shes madly in love with you
no you idiot it means she hasnt cleaned out her wallet in years
im pretty sure im still carrying around a condom from
to one of the kids son of a bitch jeremy dont eat things you find on the floor
i think it means she loves him
cause it did make me wonder

i quit my job
you were fired
i quit by getting myself fired

teresa get off the line
i knew i should have sent doug
milo do me a favor
dont call me again until you get her to jail
sid hangs up
milo turns to see cass conferring with to himself shit
milo joins cass
re dawn what was that about
i had her add mayo to your burger
i remember you like that
milo glances at dawn and she nods in confirmation
milo takes a bite from his burger and considers cass
ok look i know youre probably upset that youre not gonna get the story
but a person cant win every time right
depends on the person
well if the person youre referring to is you i agree you cant win every time
suddenly milo gets a funny look on his face
choking a little this burger
one day stuff like that is gonna kill ya
pause who knows
maybe even today
gasping i tink dere might be sesame
yeah i had her add that with the mayo
is that bad
oh wait youre violently allergic to sesame
slowly slides off his chair onto the floor
cass calmly reaches across the table taking his keys and unhandcuffing herself
car keys in hand she bends down to whisper in his ear you know what that is
oh and ill get the story
and heads for the door
into her phone
yeah theres a guy here about to go into anaphylactic shock
cass drives along on the phone with yeah charleys
listening on the boardwalk
next to an ambulance milo is unconscious on a stretcher
an emt prepares a huge syringe picks a spot on milos chest then plunges the needle into it
milo jerks up on a gurney gasping for air
that was an adrenaline shot
i dont believe it
she tried to kill me
the emt exchanges a look with the ambulance driver then helps milo off the stretcher
no one tried to kill you buddy
you just need to be more careful about what you eat
he checks his watch then pulls out the green matchbook know where this place is
charleys on the boardwalk
and just fyi when they say dont touch the dancers they mean with with any part of your body not just your hands
the emt folds the stretcher loads it into the ambulance and they drive away leaving milo in the parking lot
calling after them thanks for the ride by the way
milo starts trying handles of parked cars until he finds one thats open and slips inside
cass pulls up parks in a lot and instantly spots charleys green sign with the black horse silhouette squeezed between a burger place and a souvenir shop
she slips out of the car takes a careful look around then works her way towards the club
cass pov women dancing men drinking
seedy and cheesy at the same time
cass thinks this over then slowly lets the door swing closed
cass finds the back entrance
the door is bolted
she is looking for a window to climb into when she spots jimmys shit
cass stares at the hat jimmy is here somewhere
she presses her ear up against the back door jimmy
suddenly she hears groaning coming from inside
like someone trying to call out through a gag
she looks around
there is a window higher up on the wall
cass drags a trash can beneath the window stacks another one on top of it and cautiously climbs up
the window is locked and she cant see through it
she takes her purse and smashes a pane of glass
she wobbles on trash cans and grabs the windowsill just as jimmy is staring nervously up at the broken window
he can see hands and can hear someone cursing under their breath
the top of a head appears then a face its cass
relieved jimmy starts gesturing excitedly for her to come in
cass climbs in drops to the floor hurries over to jimmy and ungags him
untie me quick that psychopath is gonna be back here any second
cass peeks out the door then gestures for jimmy to follow
cass and jimmy are hurrying to the cadillac
cass and jimmy climb in
so what the hell is sparrow
but before jimmy can answer i have a better question
cass looks in the rearview mirror
shit dwight and ray are where the fuck is milo
jimmy almost bursts into tears
you know what
i think ill get a real job
work at kinkos
or burger king
that doesnt sound so bad anymore
who the fuck are you
so what the fuck are you doing in this car
jimmy glances back at them
do they mean he can just
spelling it out run you jackass
jimmy gives cass a quick look sorry then exits the car and takes off running down the boardwalk
cass cant believe it
she drops her forehead into the steering wheel in despair
milo is driving along in a stolen volvo cables hanging under the steering wheel from where he hot wired it
he is just coming up on the boardwalk when his phone rings
what do you want you crazy bitch
cass is seated in a booth with dwight and ray
into phone what kind of asshole runs up a gambling debt with a bunch of neanderthals
thats not what i told you to say
ray grabs the phone away from her
into phone as you can see we have your girlfriend
and im not his girlfriend
oh shes my girlfriend alright
but fair is fair you guys can keep her
ray stares at the phone
in disbelief i think he hung up
grabbing the phone gimme that
milo is pulling up
then sees his own car
he glances around cass must be around here somewhere
his phone rings again
hello luckys libations
dwight tries to explain look milo i dont think you understand were gonna hurt her
milo hears music coming from dwights end
he heads for charleys
into phone oh i understand alright and i dont blame ya
i want to hurt her all the time
cass grabs the phone from dwight
into phone milo listen theyre not kidding ok
milo slips inside and scans the room
he sees cass in a booth across the room with dwight and ray
into phone ok
say you were wrong
into phone for what
for poisoning me with sesame and almost killing me
maybe that was not the best
say you were wrong
i could have found a more mature
say you were wrong
i was possibly out of line
say you were wrong
blurting out ok ok i was wrong
admit that the only reason you were able to crack that case three years ago was because you looked through my files
i think ill hang up now
i looked through your files
are you happy
now tell them ill be there in minutes
meanwhile stop shifting in your seat like that and just tell them you have to use the bathroom
cass sits up straighter
wait a second hes here
dont look around
just do it
he hangs up
you boys mind if i use the ladies room
milo is behind the door
he slams the door closed after she is in and blocks her escape
you know what my mistake was
i never should have let you out of the trunk
im fine by the way
the doctor said i may have been technically dead for a few seconds but im fine now
cass is not impressed
she stares at him coldly
so thats what you really think
that i stole information from you
its not what i think its what i know
how else did you beat me
as though to a yr old did it ever occur to you that i just might be good at my job
milo stares at her
it actually didnt occur to him
thats what i thought
you know what milo
youre an even bigger asshole than i previously suspected and you deserve everything thats happened to you
beat and everything thats about to happen to you
about to happen
milo is just starting to realize
son of a bitch
the bathroom door shoots open and dwight and ray enter
they back milo into a corner
cass smiles at milo waves and exits
cass comes flying out of the club and runs right into dwight and ray are frisking milo taking away his array of weapons
you always carry this much gear
only during the holidays
milo is pushed out of the bathroom and comes face to face with cass
mahler appears from behind her takes one look at remember me
what the fuck
dwight steps forward from behind milo and points his gun at momentary stand off
stuck between the bad guys milo and a half naked dancer appears lapdance
everyone looks at her
she is just realizing
maybe i should come back later
girls screaming patrons running for the exit
mahler and dwight both get hit
milo crawls over to a moaning dwight and recovers his gun
he looks up in time to see cass milo comes out
the boardwalk is packed cass is lost in the crowd
milo raises his gun in the air and fires
people duck and scatter revealing cass climbing into the cadillac
cass jumps into the car and hits the gas
she is pulling away victorious when there is a sound on the roof
get off the car milo
he gives her the finger
get off the car you psychopath
oh i am a psychopath and you know why
cause you made me that way
and if im going crazy im taking you with me
he reaches a hand through the drivers window grabbing at her
cass screams squeezes her eyes shut and hits the gas
cass opens her eyes
milo is halfway in the passenger window
milo falls into the car grabbing at the wheel
they fight for control of the car as it goes spinning off the road
the cadillac skids wildly completely out of control
cops everywhere dwight and ray leaning over the hood of a squad car being handcuffed mahler unconscious on a
it was an old cadillac this crazy girl driving and the guy was like on the roof
cass and milo both just sit there breathing for a moment
then milo turns and glares at cass and the look on her face cass is back in the trunk
milo waves goodbye and slams shut the lid
immediately his cell phone rings
milo glances at it then reluctantly answers yeah
bobby ocean in the background furious what the fuck are you doing
i thought i told you to lie low
i was lying low
then how is it that a statewide all points was just put out on the two of you
its a long story
ok look you guys better come to me ill protect you til we figure this out
can you get to pier
milo looks around
he can just make out pier in the distance a mile or two away
milo and cass drive up in the cadillac and park out of sight
they exit the car and look around
the pier seems to be deserted
then they hear a soft motor and bobby appears in a get in
the sound of a motorboat chugging along
bobby is at the back of the boat steering
cass and milo are up front explaining so these guys have a bunch of stolen evidence stashed somewhere in atlantic city
and we think theyre ditching it tonight
a small yacht appears on the horizon
bobby steers the motorboat towards it
milo and cass turn to look as the yacht you know if i was them id store the evidence on a boat drive the boat about miles out and blow
the whole thing up
cass and milo both slowly turn to find bobby pointing a gun at the two of them
off milos disappointed look hey man
i got mouths to feed
thats what all the dirty cops say
bobby quickly frisks cass and frisks and disarms milo
he steers the boat one handed up next to the yacht and cuts the motorboats engine
milo makes a sudden lunge for bobby and bobby cracks him over milo struggles back up to a seated position
youve always been such a stubborn asshole milo
you just dont listen
all you had to do was stay where i told you and none of this would have happen
now the two of you are gonna have to go down with the boat
pan to the doorway where bobby stands inspecting the room
guess thats it
checking them out you know what
you guys make a great couple
bobby exits and cass and milo are alone
suddenly cass starts giggling
whats so funny
my mom was worried i wouldnt have plans for xmas eve
cass is laughing harder and harder until milo realizes hey are you crying
milo doesnt know what to do
his hands are trapped in front of him he cant even pat her on the shoulder
ok just dont
im not crying
i know youre not
miserable i cant believe i going to die by being blown up and sinking to the bottom of the ocean with someone who thinks im a total liar
were not gonna die
whats the plan
milo looks around
there is a small porthole in one wall
milo assumes a take charge manner ok
heres what we do
were going to synchronize our efforts in order to cross the room and manipulate the bomb out of the room and into the water in order to diffuse the explosive
you mean were going to throw the bomb out the window
or we can just wait to get blown up
im with you
go team go
thats the spirit
ok first were going sideways to the left
milo leans one way cass leans the other they dont move
my left this time
they both lean to the left and topple over
milo is facing the direction of the bomb
now were gonna work our way over to the bomb
they start moving like a sideways inchworm creeping along
and i dont think youre a total liar but in my own defense i was one of the top detectives in my division i had been working that case for
months and then you just waltzed in and solved it
i didnt just waltz in
you know i had been working it for months too
isnt it possible that were both good at our jobs and i just happened to come out ahead
blurting out look i was confused i had never been in love before
well neither had i
milo seems surprised to hear this
but before he can respond ow
they are stopped when milos face is slammed into the side of the boat
milo lets out a grunt
ok we need to turn to the right and wait for the next wave
they both start turning separate ways my right
they turn to the right and wait
after a moment so
you were in love with me
of course i was in love with you why do you think i married you
behind her back milo looks sheepish
you think i married you so i could get info on the case
who am i mata hari
milo looks confused
he is trying to figure out
shes a spy milo
i know that
everybody knows that
mata hari the spy
milo clears his throat
it might be a little late for this
nice job on the article
you know if i had something sharp right now i would stab you
no really i mean it was well written and
can you just get us out of here please
suddenly a wave hits the boat and they go rolling towards umph
son of a
and they come to a stop milos face pressed right up to the bomb
he watches the timer
can you see the bomb
i can see the bomb
now we get up
milo grabs the bomb and holds it against his belly
cass and milo push against each other and struggle up to a standing position
so far so good
only milo cant raise his arms
and the porthole is six feet did you throw it
well what are you waiting for
im waiting for a pig to fly in here and grab it
starting to panic again milo
um on i need you to jump
you know jump jump jump around jump
are you serious
im fucking with you
just for my own personal enjoyment
we see milos head pop into view then disappear
this time milo pops up high enough that we see his hands
and finally milo is high enough that he can thrust the bomb milo and cass both a little out of breath stand still listening
think the water defused it
lemme ask you this
has anything gone our way yet
cass and milo get drenched but are safe
now lets find something to cut these ropes off
think we can catch that cop
trust me we can definitely catch that cop
because at this very moment
bobby is paddling frantically pausing every once in a while to curse the motor which for some reason refuses to start
he see the lights of another boat coming up behind him and he paddles faster
milo steers the yacht right up behind bobby dwarfing the motorboat
calling out hey bobby
i got one for ya
bobby looks up to see milo pointing an assault rifle he whats the difference between a snowman and a snowwoman
holding something up the spark plug
bobby checks the motor so thats why it wont run
milo grabbed the spark plug
milo and cass grin down at bobby while he kicks the motor and swears
cops are everywhere
cass and milo are seated on a bench exhausted watching as the cops unload boxes of stolen evidence from the yacht
bobby is cuffed in the back of a squad car
after a moment merry xmas
i got you this
milo hands cass some seaweed
you shouldnt have
milo checks his watch
ive still got three hours to get you to jail
looks like im gonna win that bet after all
cass eyes go wide
suddenly she jumps up and bolts
to himself you have got to be kidding me
like an action sequence in slo mo cass stumbles across the sand exhausted milo at her heels
finally he makes one last effort lunges for her brings her down and snaps on the cuffs
muffled face in the im not going without a fight

he pulls her to her feet
milo leads cass up to the clerk both of them looking like a mess
he checks his watch am

and i was unjustly arrested
to shut her up milo grabs her and kisses her
then she is then milo hands her over to the clerk
to cass see ya
a little disoriented oh
the clerk leads her into the jail
he passes some cops on their way in
one gelman hey

milo stops in his tracks
mentally weighs the pros and cons
ah what the hell
he turns around walks back to gelman and smashes him in the cass is trying to find a clean place to sit down when milo oh my god what happened
