by guy ritchie draft for educational august purposes only we open on a guard sitting in front of a sentry post
he is wearing a heavy fur hat that covers his ears and a military jacket
behind him is a list of instructions in russian
he sucks in a cigarette as though hes a drowning man lookin for oxygen
a car comes to a stop by the sentry post the guard looks asks a couple of questions and is given an envelope which he quickly examines he then attempts
to stick his head in the car
a gun barrel is promptly stuck in his face and a couple of angry words emanate from the back the guard jumps back and quickly raises the barrier
this next section will be intercut with the credit sequence
on the back seat is franky four fingers new york street wise jew who is clutching a fancy looking briefcase which is handcuffed to his wrist
he is flanked by two russian hoods
this next section will be subtitled
how much further do we have to go
just then the car comes to a standstill
the window is wound down and a gun barrel is stuck through
the russian driver looks dramatically calm
pass him the money
franky hesitates for a second
franky you know you have no choice
so please can we get on with it
franky knows discussion is futile
he flips the case open and pulls out a transparent plastic bag full of american dollars
the package is pulled out of the window the driver doesnt move we dissolve for a passage of time the anxiety is more than obvious but four fingers can do
all of a sudden a package comes through the window and the car speeds off without waiting for an inspection of the delivery
franky opens the package and he reveals a stone the size of a fist
he shines a torch onto it and puts a stone inspectin monocle to his eye
franky four fingers opens a fancy case presses a hidden catch this reveals a second wall within the case he then carefully places the stone within this secret compartment and
firmly closes the case
the russian next to him is playing with a revolver he spins the chamber
if you need a man in london then call this number
franky takes the card looks at it and repeats the name
boris boris can get you anything you need
we are in the back room of an amusement arcade and can hear fruit machines beeping in the distance
meet boris the blade and tommy who is toying with a heavy looking revolver
its a bit heavy isnt it boris
heavy is good
heavy is reliable
if it doesnt work you can hit him with it
tommy practices a couple of gun slinging maneuvers
at that moment the door opens and in walks a man carrying two heavy sacks of coins
hes a rough looking bastard hes massive and extremely ugly
meet gorgeous yes gorgeous
george looks at the weapon and can see that hes interrupting
sorry tommy i hope that i am not interrupting
oh of course youre not interrupting gorgeous i put the do not disturb sign on the door because i wanted you to join us
george isnt too bright what are you doing tommy
i am baking a cake gorgeous not that i t s any of your business
put the takings down and be a good chap
george puts down the coins
tommy implies he should leave
gorgeous isnt too bright and continues to stand there looking stupid
tommy goes to turn around but can see that he hasnt left so he turns back is there anything else gorgeous a cup of tea perhaps
well in that could you kindly fuck off and shut the door behind you
tommy turns round to boris with a slight shake of his head
not too bright but he hits like a train
ok i l l take it
youre a gambling man boris so ill toss you for it
heads its mine tails ill give you twice the price
boris chews this for a second
i l l toss the coin
he tosses the coin meet hands
on the phone
cool young street wise ny diamond dealer
he catches a coin
frankys on the phone
best stone ive seen in years
good man franky you done a good job

i gotta move the smaller stones here it shouldnt take me long
i l l be a couple of days
speak to my cousin doug
doug the head
yeah doug the head
but get some security
i mean it get it today speak to those russians they can get you anything
dramatic pause and what
no fuckin around in any casinos you hear me
youve done a good job franky dont go and fuck it up
i hear ya hands
i see ya hands
the phone goes down and hands looks up at a colleague
hes got it
on the phone subtitled yes hes got it
he might call he might not but if he does be ready
i l l see what i can do
he cant know that its you boris
we do too much business together
youre gonna have to get someone else to hit him and there is no way it can relate to us
yes i understand
one more thing he loves to gamble
brick top aka mr mclean is a heavy looking fella
he is observing a giant of a man bomber harris boxing a sparring partner
two hundred and sixty pounds thats fucking pedigree pal
hes talking to liam and gary a couple of employees
he doesnt look bad does he
oh no mr mclean he looks great
hell kill him hell do you proud governor
do you reckon thats what people should do for me do you gary do me proud
thats what you deserve mr mclean
pull your tongue out of my arsehoie gary
dogs do that and youre not a dog are you gary
taken aback by the change in tone
err no i am not
however you do have all of the characteristics of a dog gary all except loyalty
there is a definite change in temperature
and people like dogs gary for the principal reason that theyre loyal
so i dont quite know where that leaves you my old son other than refuckinpugnant
there is a problem which one was it that kept the four grand from the clapham job
pause dont let me ask again
i would like answers but i am not in the mood for asking questions get busy lads or its feeding time oink oink know what i mean
liam takes a step to the side and moves his eyes in a sideways action implying the guilt lies with gary
gary catches this and opens his mouth to protest
one of brick topss henchmen errol sticks a belt in there as quick as it opens and smashes a bar across garys legs he buckles
the henchman man pulls out a plastic bag and a roll of tape
you know what to do with that dont you liam
dont look for your sake
pov of smaller fighter we witness liam putting the bag over garys head and tying tape round his neck
gary tries to resist but its futile and we vaguely witness the demise of poor gary
youre a ruthless cunt liam i l l give you that
brick top turns away at this point to admire his fighter
but i got no time for grasses
we cut to see liams panic filled eyes
the bar comes down again
brick top finds more interest in his fighter
feed em to the pigs errol
with a short beat
hes looking good bomber is he not
hows their man getting on
we whip pan off brick tops boxing ring
and the whip pan shot takes us into this boxing ring
meet turkish he is tommys partner
turkish is older and wiser than tommy they are both watching gorgeous go through his paces
gorgeous george is head butting a heavy punch bag
the sound that emanates is disturbing and tommy is distracted
is he allowed to do that
turkish is drinking milk from a bottle its an unlicensed boxing match tommy not a tickling competition
these lads are out to hurt each other
oi turkish can i have a drink
turkish looks over his shoulder and then points to himself what do i look like to you george a fuckin water boy
turkish looks at the water boy
oi son look lively
back to tommy
look at it
he turns to see the remnants of a caravan where they keep the training gear and administration for the fights how am i supposed to run this thing from that
we gonna need a proper office
he looks at the caravan again and sighs it is quite pitiful i want a new one tommy and you re going to buy it for me
whats wrong with this one
turning back to tommy and ascending the steps in to his i have seen better days caravan turkishs foot goes through one of the stairs and the
door comes off at the hinges as he tries to open it
oh nothing tommy its tip top its just i am not sure about the colour
he passes him a piece of paper here its all arranged
you just gotta pick it up
heres an address
tommy looks at the address and frowns
i t s that campsite
thats right youre buying a caravan caravans live in campsites
they arent pikey are they
i dont know what they are all i know is they have a caravan and we want a caravan
i hope theyre not pikies
i hate fucking pikies
youre a sensitive boy aint you tommy
you got ten grand and i want to see change
he is distracted by the bulge in tommys trouser front
fuck me hold tight whats that
its my gucci belt turkish
pointing quite clearly at the gun
no tommy theres a gun in your trousers
what is a gun doing in your trousers
its for protection
protection from what the germans
the war ended fifty years ago
err whats to stop it blowing your balls off every time you sit down
where did you get it
looking down onto his gun
boris the blade
you mean boris the sneaky fucking russian
turkish pulls the gun out of tommys front
i t s a bit heavy isnt it
h e spins the chamber the weight is a sign of reliability
i always go for reliability
boris is showing franky a large pistol
i l l take it
how much do you want for it
pause ok so what do you want for it
i want you to do something for me
franky nods for him to go on
there is a fight in a couple of days what kind of a fight
the camera tracks into franky he has a problem and its been exposed
there is a bookies i know that will take bets
if you place one down for me we will call it quits
why dont you put it down yourself
well there isnt too many bookies that take those kind of bets and i already have an outstanding debt with the house
i know something most dont
why dont you put a few pounds down yourself
frankie shrugs and implies he wants to hear more
what do you mean
on the phone
play the game doug
doug the head is an east london jew about forty five almost completely bald and proud of it he sits with his two twin daughters alex and susi they look
like prada models but as soon as they open their mouths its clear that they arent they have extremely rough london accents
doug is on the phone to hands
i am playing the game hands
thats what i l l give ya
hands shakes his head in disbelief
you gotta haggle fairly doug otherwise itll make your hair fall out youll see
you know i wont buy poop
he isnt selling poop
listen if the stones are kosher then ill by em
now i gotta business to run
he puts the phone down
that was my cousin hands have i told you about my cousin hands
yes dad you have
hes an important fella
yes dad you told us
is that a prawn sandwich youre eating
doug looks mildly embarrassed is it
youre jewish dad
i was last timei looked
well you cant eat shell fish dad i t s against your persuasion
what persuasion myself or the prawns belongs to is not the issue the issue is how a fuckin shrimp managed to sneak in to my sandwich
he throws the half eaten sandwich out the window
we cut to an enormous and frightening looking dog sniffing the half eaten prawn sandwich before he is yanked away by his master
the dog is a lively young thing
we raise the camera to see the man that is walking it
vinny is a very large black man the size is due to dumplings not dumbbells
stops outside a shop
we see it clearly
i t s a pawnbrokers
move it come on move i t
vinny enters the pawn shop
meet sol whos behind the counter vinnys partner in the pawn shop
hes concentrating on the deal at hand with bad boy lincoln and has a stone inspecting monocle to his eye
alright sol lincoln
they are in deep discussion and only lincoln responds
its a mosinite
no a mosinite
how much a night
no a fuckin mosinite
its the updated zirconia
enough of bosinites and mosonias talk english to me sol
zirconias are artificial diamonds they look pretty good to the novice like you lincoln
but you could break them with a hammer so they came up with mosinites
what are you saying
i am saying its worth fuck all
lincolns face drops fuck what
i t s worth more than fuck what but not a lot more
we have told you before lincoln you stick to being a gangster and leave this game to me and sol
sol looks round properly at vin and can see that hes accompanied by a dog
whats that vince
err its a dog sol
where do you think youre going with that vince
you cant bring that thing in here
its in here whats the problem its only a dog
i know full fucking well what it is vin
where did you get it
those gypsies they threw it in with a load of moody gold
sol considers this and decides it cant be all bad
it better not be dangerous
does it look dangerous
yes it fucking does vin
if it so much as farts its out
if it farts well all be out
vin turns around and runs into boris whos entered the shop without making a noise
jesus where did you come from
oi sol boris is here
boris whats up
i have a job for you
i want you to hold up a bookies
how high do you want us to hold it
steady on george
we deal in jewellery boris we dont hold up bookies
we can hear vinny in the background hear me out
this one is different
tommy is driving down a country lane with gorgeous george in the passenger seat
dont you worry gorgeous hes a big man granted but you gotta bigger punch than judy
cut to a caravan camp site comes into view
its the pikey jesus whats that
thats what we are looking for
i t s a camp site
its a pikey campsite
what are we doing here
we are buying a caravan
off a pack of fucking pikies
whats wrong with you
thisll get messy
not if youre here
oh fuck off tommy you never said anything about pikies
calm down we are buying and then we are off
oh you bastard i hate fuckin pikies
they arrive in the camp site and the car is immediately surrounded by kids
the kids most of whom are on bikes speak with a sort of anglo irish mix that sounds as rough as the kids look
thats a flash car mister
not as flash as your bike though is it
who you looking for
do you want me to go and get him
there is a pause the boy doesnt move
well are you going to go and get him
there is another pause
well what are you waiting for
the five quid you are going to pay me
oh fuck off ill find him myself
you can have a quid
oh youre a tight fucker arent ya
a man shouts from the background
hes a young fella with a hard but friendly face when he smiles
hes covered in grease and facial hair and his trousers are done up with string
but hes wearing a cartier watch and gucci shoes and a large gold identity bracelet
this is micky oneill
what are you doing paul
get out of the way boy
are you tommy have you come about the caravan
fuck man call me micky
micky comes up to the car cleaning his grease covered hands with a hand towel
how are ya
i am well sir well quite well the weather is being kind to us but the engines arent
gorgeous george steps out of the car
micky takes a step back
fuck me would you look at the size of him jesus man how big are you
hey kids how fucking big is he
hes a big man thats for sure
would you look at the size of his muscles
and then look at the size of his fists
hey mum come and look at the size of this fella
the kids start to feel his arms
gorgeous george plays the game and raises the kids on his biceps
mickys mum comes out to see
would you look at the strength of the man
i bet you can box a little cant you sir
you look like a boxer
get out of the way micky and see if the fellas would like a drink
i could murder one
there wont be any murdering done around here i dont mind telling ya
would the big fella like a cup of tea
dont be silly micky a man didnt get that size from drinking cups of tea
offer the man a guiness boy
lift me up would you mister
i bet you cant lift us both at the same time
tommy and gorgeous follow micky whos walking past a kennel
the dogs are in good condition and are happy as you like to see
micky stops and gives one of them a stroke
good dogs do you like dogs
sure yeah i like dogs
i like caravans more
we open on vinnys dog now sitting in a car its breathing heavily and doesnt look well and sol doesnt see the funny side of the dog sitting next to
the man driving is called tyrone hes a white guy who thinks hes black
vin is also in the car
i dont want him dribbling on my seats man
give him another of those biscuits
they shut him up
they give him wind
tyrone turns round to complain and narrowly misses a car
hey watch the road
fuck me you want this man to drive us sol
can you drive mate
no vin he cant tell the difference between a steering wheel and a man on the moon
that s why i got him
sol gives the dog another biscuit
dont you worry about me jus worry about the dog on my seats man
tyrone gets out of the car to put some petrol in
sol whys he talking like a black man
i dont know vin
oi tyrone vin wants to know why you talk like a black man
roots and ting seen
sol and vin raise their eyebrows
roots and what
i dont know
you get that gun from boris
it wasnt exactly what i was expecting mind
mean looking bastard though thats for sure
sol unzips a bag
inside is a ridiculously powerful shotgun
its a shotgun sol
i t s a fuckin anti aircraft gun vin
what are you planning on shooting the angels out of the clouds
thats gonna raise more than pulses
it will raise hell my old son
i dont think i really want to see hell vin
whats wrong with a normal gun
the are psychological advantages to a gun that looks like it can perforate the moon
tyrone gets into the car starts it up again and puts some money in the car wash machine
can you get this fuckin dog to stop dribbling on me
vin pulls the dog back
i worry about you vin jesus talk about overkill
one look at a crack desperate brother and you could wave a knife and fork around and i am sure they would lick the salt of your scrotum
the car wash starts
what the fuck are you doing
i never do a job unless i have a clean car i like to make my wheels look crisp
are you serious
you re a getaway driver youre not here to show your fuckin car off
the machine starts
they do the windows up and that point the dog lets out a fart
the water starts to hit the windshield so they cant undo the windows
there is more an atmosphere of disbelief than of concrete anger
gorgeous george fastens the caravan to the back of their land rover and pulls away
they wave at micky and he reciprocates
hes a good dog
hell get a little homesick for a while but he get over it
tommy has a dog that looks distressed about leaving micky sitting next to him
i dont know what all your fuss was about
they arent bad fellas
just then the wheels of the caravan come straight off and the caravan is dragged until the car comes to a sudden stop
the dog jumps out the window and goes bounding back to the campsite
they are looking at the damage
of course i t s completely useless now
i dont think its supposed to have done that
the dog is behind mickys legs happy to be back
the deal was you bought it how you saw it
tommy goes to interrupt but he doesnt get a chance look i have helped ya as much as i am gonna help ya
you still got a car and i suggest you use it before youre not welcome anymore
there is a silence for a while
the atmosphere has gone more than frosty and a few more gypsies are hanging around
interrupted it was only a question of time before you got some attention
nobody brings a fella the size of you unless they are trying to say something without talking
just give us my money and you can keep your caravan
why the fuck do i want a caravan thats got no fuckin wheels
i am not going to do that
gorgeous george steps forward
where the fuck do you think youre going
you want to settle this with a fight
youll do no such thing michael
alright mum we shant well settle it some other way now dont get upset
i wont have you fighting micky
mickys mum is getting upset and its consequently upsetting micky
okay mum okay
you need to sit down
micky calls to one of the lads standing by
darren look after mum
get her sitting down
we see mum being led out by darren micky looks genuinely concerned for his mum
pause as micky waits for her to be well gone
i l l fight you for it
tommy looks at gorgeous george
gorgeous george raises his eyebrows
the two fighters start pacing
it looks a bit ridiculous micky is dwarfed by comparison
gorgeous george takes a swipe it was an
impressive punch but micky is a quick littl bastard and sidesteps
micky does nothing to retaliate his hands are still by his side
gorgeous george lunges out and grabs micky by the throat and groin picks him up like a sack of spuds and throws him against the car door
all eyes are on micky for a second or two then he rises and appears little bothered by this he gets up brushes himself off and starts to pace again
hardly even looking at the big man
you want to stay down my friend i promise you you want to stay down
micky ignores this and continues to pace the big fella grabs him and puts him in a headlock and charges him into the stable door
there is a terrible noise
now you fucking stay down boy or you wont be coming up next time
it appears as though this is going to get messy and any humour that might have been around has now evaporated
micky raises his head there is still no damage to speak of
all of a sudden he starts jumping up and down like hes warming up throwing a few shadow punches taking off his shirt
this reveals a heavily tattooed and scarred torso and underneath these embellishments is a physique that warrants some respect
this is sick
i am outta here
youre not going anywhere my friend
you stay until the job is done
micky starts pacing and throwing out a couple of shadow punches with his back to gorgeous george he still hasnt really acknowledged his opponent
gorgeous george moves in for the coup de grace micky spins on his feet and catches the big man under the jaw
fade in we see gorgeous george lying on the floor with a head the size of a water melon
there is blood streaming out of every orifice in his head hes in
we are in slow motion theres a lot of activity going on around the body on the floor their mouths are open but we cant hear what they are saying
all we can hear is the voice over given by tommy
this isnt good if george doesnt wake up in the next few minutes i have a problem
i am scared really fuckin scared
there is something coldblooded and practical about what these people are thinking
they will pop me like a hot sausage if george doesnt wake up
why do they want to go to the trouble of explaining why a man died in a campsite
these people dont exist in society you cant find them they live under their own laws and ignore everybody elses
i am scared i am really fuckin scared
we see turkish with a somewhat serious expression on his face he has his customary pint of milk on one side he takes a sip and ohhhs and arrrs for
so youre telling me he would have run you through if gorgeous hadnt woken up
no his mum stopped it
if his mum hadnt turned up well i d be pikey fuckin sausages
what were you thinking of
why the fuck did you put gorgeous george into a bare knuckle boxing match two days before he had to fight the bomber
he was half his size
he pantomimes a man that would reach his navel i didnt expect him to get hurt
you put the man into a bare knuckle boxing match
he raises his voice what the fuck did you expect
a grease down and a shiatsu
who took the jam out of your donut
you took the fuckin jam out of my donut tommy you did
you said get a good deal so
tell me the correlation between a hospitalized boxer and a good deal
pause there is no correlation as tommy knows
how are we going to explain to brick top that his fight isnt going to
we replace the fighter
oh what and hope he doesnt notice
and who the fuck are we going to replace him with
john the gun
or mad fist willy
youre not exactly mr current affairs are you tommy
mad fist went mad and the gun shot himself
what about clam hand tony
got his fingers caught in the till
hes no good to anyone
knuckle boxer isnt a lot of good without any fuckin knuckles tommy
pause for thought then turkish has the look of a man that has come across a really bright idea
lets use the fuckin pikey
doug the head and franky four fingers are doing a deal
doug has a case open and is admiring a couple of stones
from russia with love
i told you i was interested
frankys in a rush
i got stones to sell fat to chew and many different men to see about many different dogs so if i am not rushing you could you spit shine the
top of your smoothie and move a little faster
hold tight franky when in rome
i am not in rome doug i am in a rush
he looks at his watch i gotta make the bookies
what you betting on
some guy called bomber harris
the unlicensed boxer
you know something i dont
doug raises his eyebrows you get busy franky
put a couple of hundred down for me
what do you say
how much you going to pay us
i lose more than that running for the bus
i l l do it for a caravan
no a caravan
you are sitting in one if that makes things easier
i want a top caravan
it was us that wanted a caravan
anyway whats wrong with this one
its not for me it s for me mum
doug is on the phone to hands
i overpaid hands i want you to recognize charity when i t s offered
do shut up where is he now
i dont know hands i m not his mother
but i am seeing him later
he wants cash so hes coming back after he has been to a fight
there is a serious expression of alarm on handss face the camera crashes in
what do you mean a fight you mean a boxing match
is there gambling involved
i t s a boxing match hands
hands isnt happy
did he have a case with him
and hes gone gambling
thats franky i have a problem with gambling fuckin four fingers you are talking about doug
what am i telepathic
franky is good at buying stones doug but hes a fuckin liability when it comes to gambling
that has cost me
so in turn rit s cost him
he gets distracted and chopping off a digit seems to focus his attention
how much can he lose
hands pulls a face like what kind of a stupid question is that
he them starts to shout i l l not forgive you doug i am coming over get me that car
the phone is slammed down
we see the undercarriage of concorde taking off
tommy and turkish walk into a pub and approach the barman
they reach the bar
we are here to see brick top
the barman looks them up and down a bit
hes not doing anything
i am very busy at the moment
i am not asking you to break sweat i am asking you to call brick top
never heard of him
well make a call and see if someone else has
say its turkish
the barman looks bothered by the fact he has to move but wanders off
turkish looks at the pool table
you know what hes done to people on that pool table
they both give the table an eyeball
what potted more balls than any other player
what else can you do to people on a pool table
quite a fuckin lot if you nail em to it
two heavy looking fellas appear out of the woodwork
the heavy fella opens up the bar and beckons turkish and tommy through
they go through another door and the corridor turns into a mass of dogs barking snarling and whining in cages
the mood is sinister
they reach another door they open up and we are introduced to a dog fight
a load of heavy geezers are commenting on the performance of the dogs one dog is being carried out by a single leg its covered in blood
another dog is left in the ring it too is covered in blood but its survived
they can charm the paint off walls these fellas
a circle of blunt faces are exchanging money with one another a few faces turn round to examine tommy and turkish they frown slightly but carry on about their business
once they see they are accompanied by the muscle
the heavy walks over to brick top
the heavy taps him on the shoulder and whispers
he acknowledges and gives his drink to the heavy
he walks over
there is a cage next to brick top which has a pit bull in and brick top who is carrying a cane pokes it through the cage doors
the dog snarls back
look mean now you hairy fucker wont ya
he looks at the appalled faces of turkish and tommy
shits itself when you put it in the ring but poke
it with a stick and watch his bollocks grow
you like a dog fight turkish
i like my dog to growl at the post man
gorgeous ready for tonight
we donc have a gorgeous anymore
brick top turns round and indicates that he would like the noise around him to drop
it does marginally
youre going to have to repeat that
we have lost gorgeous george
brick top turns round again at the already subdued crowd he doesnt raise his voice but the crowd reacts
i said keep the noise down
a tangible silence between the men reflects brick tops authority
well where did you lose him
he isnt a set of fuckin car keys is he
and its not as though he is inconfuckinspicuous is it
i am not backing out
you can bet your bollocks to a barn dance youre not backing out
we are changing the fighter
brick top wasnt expecting anything out of tommy
oh fuck me your lady friend has got a voice
and who might you be changing him to sweetheart
you wont know him
pause a look of youre kidding comes over his face
are you taking the piss
no there was an accident
ill show you a fuckin accident
youve still got your fight
no i lose all bets at the bookies
you cant change fighters at the last minute so no i dont have my fight do i you fuckin prat
you could take bets at the fight
put a lead on her turkish before she gets bitten
pause make sure your man goes down in the fourth
youre on thin fuckin ice my pedigree chums and ill be there if it breaks
the black guys pull up intyrones car outside the bookies vin is playing with the dog in the back
i am not happy about that dog vin you cant bring a dog on a job
you cant leave him on his own not to begin with he gets homesick
homesick for fucks sake
if he gets the chance he runs back to the gypsies campsite
ohh shut up how can he find it
i dont know sol i am not a dog
it s like hes got a fuckin homing beacon
give him the chance and hes off
youre going soft vin
here pass me a sandwich
vin throws a sandwich to sol but the dog catches it whilst i t s in flight and swallows it in one gulp
jessssus he didnt even chew it
the car has stopped
what have you stopped here for
whats wrong with that space
its too tight
what are you talking about tight
you could land a jumbo fuckin jet in there
leave him alone hes a natural
tyrone gets a little over excited with the accelerator and reverses with a crashing sound into the rear of the van behin them ie it s parked back to back
a natural fuckin idiot
tyrone what have you done
look you hassle me see what happens
tyrone makes to move the van forward again
well dont move it now otherwise people will see the damage
what did you do that for
i didnt see it there
its a four ton truck
it s not as though i t s a ferret fuckin a flea is it
it was at a funny angle
vin is confused as to this last statement
it was behind you tyrone whenever you reverse things come from behind you
i am not happy sol
the dog starts whining
give him something to shut him up
sol throws a plastic squeaky dog ball that was in the front
the dog grabs in and swallows it in one gulp
the brothers look on in shock
he cant swallow a whole ball
he swallowed it
the dog looks up having completed the task
vin who looks quite alarmed holds the dog by the ribs and squeezes there is a squeak
doug and alex are waiting to pick up hands
did you get hands that car
i got him one like it
doug is in shock
what do you mean one like it
i got him the volante
what did i say
what exactly did i say
you said get him the vantage
thats right i clearly said get him the vantage
so why did you get the volante
because they look the same
the septuagint scholars mistranslated the hebrew word for young woman in to the greek word for virgin because they thought they looked the same coming up with the prophecy behold
a virgin shall conceive and bear a son
but there is a world of difference between a virgin and a young woman like there is between a volante and a fuckin vantage
pause she thinks about this
are you saying that the fact that your cousin hands is driving a valiant instead of a vantage is a profound a mistake as a whole religion
yes i fuckin am
cars are his religion
he can drive a valiant in the states but i cant drive a vantage because they wont tolerate the emissions
well its too late now thats concorde
hands and his sidekick rosebud are coming out of the sliding glass doors towards doug whos now standing by the car with his arms crossed
hands is quite clearly looking for a car
how about a hug for your old cousin doug
he stops looking for his car and focuses on doug
fuck off you fat bald bastard and wheres my car
the black guys are sitting in the car still
the occasional squeak comes from the dog
how am i going to get it out
hell probably cough it up
do you think hell be alright
what are we waiting for
we are waiting for a man carrying a case
because the deal is that we give the russian the case and we keep the money
he rubs his fingers symbolically together whats in the case
sol turns round to talk to tyrone
fuckin ell tyrone you ask a lot of questions
you concentrate on the driving okay
he turns back just as a man is stepping into the bookies he is carrying a case
shit was that him
dont ask me youre the one supposed to keep an eye on it
how many fingers did he have
are you serious
i am sorry but i couldnt get the binoculars out in time
well lets not stand on ceremony lets start the show
they get out of the van and go up to the bookies leaving tyrone in the van
theres a double set of glass doors
sol pushes them open and vinny walks in first while sol hangs back with the shotgun
inside is the man with the case busy filling in a slip and two clerks behind the betting counter
vinny doesnt mince around and goes straight to the counter where the head clerk pauline comes up to help
yes sir how can i help
you can start by giving me all your money
does sir know who this bookies belongs to
belongs to me now
vinny then leans over the counter to get menacing
pauline looks more than a little concerned if you know whats good for
he is cut short as pauline triggers a button under the counter and a security screen comes flying up at a very rapid rate of knots protecting all the counters
this has the unfortunate consequence of taking vinny with it
poor vin is shot straight to the ceiling all we can see is half a body and his desperately searching for ground legs
needless to say this leaves sol in a bit of a bewildered state
hes looking the wrong way at the critical moment and is left wondering what happened not having seen vince impaled on the ceiling
sol extracts the enormous shotgun
he spins round looking for his colleague
a muffled noise tells him to look up
what are you doing vince
and what the fuck are you doing up there
a few groans emanate from the other side of the counter
sol panics some more and decides that emergency action is called for
i have got your man out here
if you dont put down the screen ill blow his fucking head off
you hear me
i dont care you can do what you like hes not related to me
you think you can try me
sol raises the gun and fires into the side
of the wall
theres an enormous explosion and a clear hole is made in the side of the wall
the powerful kick from the gun also makes sol momentarily airborne
we see tyrone grimace at the sound of the shotgun
sol pulls himself together and marches up to the hole in the wall that the shot created and pokes the gun through
drop the screen now
you just seen what it did to this wall so think what it could do to you
pauline knows she has lost this one and looks genuinely scared
to the other clerk do it
i said do it
the screen comes down with a thud
this means that vince comes down with just as serious a thud
he lets out another groan
how you doing vince
a weakened voice retorts
how do i look like i am doing you fucking idiot
i would be doing a lot better if you would stop using my name
consoled that his colleague is not dead its back to business for sol
he raises the gun and pulls his fiercest face
now fill this bag
all bets are off
i am not here to make a fuckin bet
all bets are off
are you fuckin stupid
i dont care if the fuckin bets are off
if all bets are off then there cant be any money can there
there is a pause
sol knows hes fucked
she points to a black board that clearly states all bets are off i aint buying that
i aint fuckin selling it its a fact
pause well what have you got
nothing i mean we got a few coins but no notes
can we just get out of here please
i am not feeling too funny
sols temper does have a limit
well i am not feeling too fucking funny myself let me tell you
sol points at the man on the floor who is carrying the case
let me see your hands
the man holds his hands up
he has got a perfect set of five fingers on both hands
sol puts his head in his hands
pauline and the other clerk put two bags full of coins on the counter
sol picks them up and frowns hes not happy with a bag full of change
he puts his gun down and starts to rifle through the bag
pauline can see vinnys pistol on the counter dropped after his encounter with the screen
what do you mean copper fuckin coins
pauline sees her opportunity and grabs the pistol
goes for it too but hes beaten to it
sol ducks pulling vince with him pauline lets out a series of shots in their direction sol counter blasts over the top of the counter
the security screen comes flying back up
get me out of here now sol
vinny does sound convincingly desperate
were going vin
he grabs the bag of copper coins grabs vince and marches towards the doubledoors
they open the first set and then they try to open the second
they push the door nothing happens
there is no going back
sol starts to kick the glass door but it doesnt budge
with panic rising swiftly sol doesnt fuck around he takes aim with the handgun and fires the bullet shatters the glass but it doesnt break through and the bullet now
ricochets off both glass doors shattering bullet proof glass all around them
vinnys panic filled eyes attempt to follow its trajectory
sol is unaware of the ricochet and before vin has time to warn him sol fires another bullet
now he observes the problem and waits for the inevitable
the bullet tears through the bag of coins which then empties its contents at vins and sols feet
eventually the bullet hits poor vince in the thigh
sol sinks to the floor he has given up
amongst the yells emanating from vince we can hear sols pathetic and desperate whimpering
no security eh
at that point tyrone appears and pushes the door open
the door was open the whole time only sol was pushing it the wrong way
what the fuck are you two doing
they stumble out into the street
vinny is in big trouble
they throw him into the van
just as sol gets into the back we hear kicking noises on metal from the van behind
tyrone pulls out
and the rear doors of the van behind them fly open
franky four fingers appears from the back of this van
he was locked in due to the fact that the black guys van was blocking his exit
tyrone get us outta here
tyrone takes an interest in the man from the van ie franky seeing that hes carrying a case and the case is connected to his wrist
i said get us outta here tyrone
the aston martin comes to a screeching halt outside
doug is quite pale from the ride
hands looks almost satisfied with the car
gotta say its not bad
he then looks at the sign of the rundown venue his eyes squint incredulously
doug approaches the entrance
private night tonight chaps
doug passes him a ticket
the doorman steps to the side
they continue to walk past several other doorman who all inspect the ticket
jesus are we ever going to get in there
you gotta understand that this isnt exactly vegas and its not exactly legal
i am not looking for vegas doug i am looking for franky four fingers
well he said he was going to be here
if theres gambling involved hell be here
they get nudged aside by an entourage of men coming through
hello whos your man
hands points out brick top who is being crowded by minders
horrible bastard its his fight made all his money in
he touches the side of his nose and inhales
so he doesnt need to do this but hes got dark taste for fights and blood he wants to impress londons criminal royalty
he points out jack the all seeing eye and salt peter they are surrounded by heavies
with a tip on when who hits the floor
any man with veins in his brains knows brick top knows the answer
cut back to jack and salt pete
those boys make brick top look like a skirt clinging thumb sucker
and i f y o u p l a y wi t h f i r e
cut to a few still shots of atrocities committed by the men in question
so michael you got it clear
its the fourth round
ill tap you anyway to let you know when to go down
just make sure the man doesnt kill me before the fuckin fourth
as long as we keep them happy
brick top nods at jack and salt peter they nod back
make sure they are kept sweet
the last thing i want is them fuckin moaning
in the blue corner i have the young and only unchallenged cutthroat of calamity meaner than beelzebubs conscience cleaner
give it up for the bone crunching one punch machine gun micky
a murky sound of displeasure emanates round the arena
the audience dont know who he is and dont care either
and in the other corner a man that needs no introduction to destruction the solo warrior of walthamstow sometimes known as buckshot peter or sometimes known as the dictator
to the devastator he put the e in eradicate the o in obliterate and the a in annihilate you know this monster of a monster the sinister prime minister
bomber the mad man harris
the audience goes mad
its hard to tell whether its out of affectionate enthusiasm or just enthusiasm
now i want a good dirty fight lads so now its that time again
get ready to rrrrrrummmmmble
the two come out to fight
bomber harris lifts his monster hands to do damage
they pace each other for a second
then micky lets one go
contin ued it hits bomber harris square on the jaw this has the effect of forcing blood out of his ears the man is positively out cold
we crashtrack into various characters reactions brick top turkish and tommy etc
all are in shock
the ref who is obviously paid off as well tries to resuscitate harris but its not happening he catches a look of desperation from one of the villains and is
eventually left with little choice but to hold mickys hand up
we cut to the nasty looking characters that we saw before they have approached with their heavies and they are obviously not satisfied
tha nks for the tip brick top
i have just said goodbye to forty large because of you whats the crack
nb the first half of this scene happens about midway scene as tyrone parks the van we cut back to frankie four fingers getting out of his van
he takes a quick look around and enters the back of his van
there he raises the spare tire and picks up his gun he examines it and places it in his trouser front
he then turns to exit
at which point there is a loud smash and franky is knocked backwards as tyrone hits his van
time wise were now at the end of scene frankie wakes up
he has a trickle of blood dripping down the back of his neck he looks at his watch and panics
he kicks the doors a couple of times nothing happens but on the third kick the doors spring open
franky brushes himself off and makes his way to the bookies
we cut to tyrone
tyrone clocks the case attached to franky wrist
gets out and slams the end of the gun across franky four fingers head
he falls to the ground
tyrone tries to take the case off him but i t s handcuffed to his wrist
so he has little choice but to pick him up and throw him in to the back of the car with the other two
we cut to the black guys trying to open the case
they have frankys hand up on a desk and are fiddling with the handcuff whatever they are trying to break in with snaps off
vinny is frustrated and illustrates his dissatisfaction
where s the russian
he should be here in a minute
well get him to open it
vinny turns to franky who has tape over his eyes
oi you four fingers how are we going to get into your case
if you take the tape off my eyes i ml tell you
what do you need the tape off your eyes for
you talk out of them
just tell us the combination
i cant remember the combination i can only do it if i see it
pause you look at us and its good night
vinny takes it off
franky blinks at the revelation of light
and gets busy opening the case
he opens it and its got about a grand inside
and heres the money
i dont believe this
why are you carrying round a case with this little in it
vin turns to sol and tyrone who is leaning on the big shotgun at which point franky pulls out the gun from the secret compartment in the case
now be a bunch of good fellas and lie down on the floor
tyrone goes for the big gun and franky pulls the trigger
nothing happens other than a big click there is silence for a long second and the black guys open their tightly shut eyes
tyrone also looks into the case and sees the
open secret compartment this also reveals the stone
hello what have we got here
boris is admiring the outside of the shop
he walks in
franky is tied up on a stool in front of him is the case and its open
boris waves the black guys to come into the corridor so they can talk without being heard
what are you doing with him
the case was attached to his body
so why didnt you chop it off
sol looks horrified by the thought
err because we didnt
now boris we have or rather you have a problem
there wasnt any money there
v boris pulls out a wad of notes theres ten grand
we want this or at least half of this
vin holds up the stone the atmosphere changes
what was in the case was mine what was in the bookies was yours ok there wasnt much but heres ten large to help the situation
i am afraid its too late for that boris
he holds up the diamond
boris eyes follow him as he walks back into the room where franky is and puts the diamond back into the case while hes talking and changes the combination
we want half and thats because we are being generous
we could by rights keep the whole fuckin stone
boris grimaces and pulls out a gun from god knows where and within a second shoots poor franky in the face
frankys body disappears off the stool that he was sitting on
the black guys are stunned into silence
you fuckin idiots
he couldnt know who i am
now open the case and give me
the black guys are left with their mouths open everything just changed gear and they werent expecting that
you have the ten grand now give me the stone
the pause continues
boris lets a shot off that tears worryingly close to sols head
the only man that knows the combination you just shot
boris appears little bothered by this and whips out a four foot machete that he was concealing about his person
he pulls the case towards him and brings the machete down with full force
we can tell by the expression on tyrones face that it must have been some part of frankys anatomy
pointing to the ground hes your problem now
you can keep the ten grand along with the body but if i see you again
well look at him
he points to franky
while he is saying this he bends down and picks up the case from the floor and wraps the severed arm in newspaper
he then walks out of the shop casual as you like
turkish pulls up outside his arcade and has a look around all seems to be clear
i aint going in the front
i dont think its a good idea you going in at all
the car surges off round the back
unless you are going to transcendentally extract the passports and cash from out of a steel safe i cant see any other way of getting them
keep your eyes peeled
turkish has another look around the back well i cant see anyone
after i have got in go round the front and call me if you see anything
turkish lets himself in and walks through
everything seems to be fine
he walks into his office has a quick look around and makes his way to the safe under the floor
he decides to put the kettle on does so and his attention is caught by something he looks at the cups on the side and sees that one is waiting
to be made
he stands back and looks at the cupboards he sees that they are all open
then he sees that the kettle is already boiled
where do you keep the sugar
shit you scared the life outta me
you wait till you see what the pigs do to you
what brings you two here run out of pants to sniff
thats very good turkish
very cool turkish
well what do you want
i want two sugars in my tea
what do you want john
i want to see him lying cold and still but we arent here for what we want are we errol
errol shakes his head slowly
turkishs phone rings
they let it ring for a while
well arent you going to answer it
tommy on the phone
brick tops just landed hes walking in the front i would move it if i were you turkish
turkish puts down the phone whats happening with the tea
you have to every thing else
that sounds like hostility doesnt it john
oh we dont like hostility do we errol
no john we dont but i am sure he could be pacified what do you think john
here you hold his arms and i l l hold his legs
in walks brick top before the boys have had a chance to get a grip
got the kettle on
turkish adapts to his new circumstances
you want sugar
no thank you turkish i am sweet enough
if i turn my back am i going to get a hole through it
dont be silly turkish if i wanted you dead would i be talking
youve provided me with a problem which you gonna have to remedy
i gotta bare knuckle fight in a couple of days
i want to use the pikey
of course fuckin of course i wasnt asking i was telling
but this time i do want him to go down in the fourth
and i do mean it this time
pause now i know you came back
open your safe so now you can open it
there is nothing turkish can do
brick top exits with errol and john and grimaces with
hes holding the contents of turkishs safe
hes been a busy little bastard that turkish
i think you have let him get away with enough all ready gov
brick top looks round with some concern
it can get you into a lot of trouble thinking errol i shouldnt do so much of it
pause as errol wants the ground to swallow him up
well that takes care of one little piggy now find me the silly sods that blagged the bookies
find em today
the film stock is s and things seem more dated
this is confirmed by the dress of our man tony
tony is standing outside a scrap metal yard and he is kicking the door of a portacabin
open up charlie
the only thing i open up is you
i t s lucky you
got me charlie it could have been one of the other lads and then think how much trouble you d be in
you come through that door and youll be going out prostrate
it doesnt belong to you charlie
he kicks open the door
charlie is standing behind his desk holding a pistol directly at tony
on the table is a bag of what we must believe is coke its open and charlie has it all over his nose
you silly fucker you cant go running off with other peoples gear
how much you put up your nose
charlie opens up he fires four shots straight into tony who buckles and falls to the floor
tony seems only shaken and he holds his hands out to inspect them hes bleeding
oh you silly cunt
tony stands and walks towards charlie
charlie is understandably shocked and fires another
it goes straight through tony and we see the blood hit the wall behind
go down boy go down
tony keeps going for him
charlie raises the gun and points it at tonys face and fires the last shot
the bullet goes straight into his mouth but it went in at an angle and it exits his cheek
tony is standing there with six
bullet holes in him and bleeding all over the carpet
as he talks blood courses its way down his front and a strong lisp is frustrating the words
ohh youf in twouble nowf
tony slowly extracts a short sword from behind him
fear has set into charlies face and has rendered him useless
the car comes to a halt again
they have only made forty this year
you could find the maker of this engines signature on the engine
but you cant find me franky
no its true
i cant findhim but i know a man that can
cut to a shot of hands encouraging him to continue
bullet tooth tony
hell find franky for you
what is he
would be a more appropriate question
doug frowns at susi but continues
hes the best chance you have of finding franky
he has upset every bad boy in town at some point or another but nobodys got the nuts to knock him off because they arent sure whether you can kill
you really think he can find him
hell find you moses and the burning bush if you pay him to
ok so lets get hold of him
firstly you gotta understand hes a little strange
he could swing from trees wearing rubber dresses as far as i am concerned all as i care about is whether he can find franky
turkish and tommy pull up outside the pikey camp
mickys mum is sitting in her chair surrounded by kids
theyre very nice tommy
tommy has produced a bunch of flowers from somewhere
turkish finds this a great surprise
where did they come from
youre a snake in the grass tommy
you looking for micky
do you know where i can find him
pause well would you like to share that information with me ms oneill
i dont want you getting my boy in to any trouble you hear me

hes coursing hes a couple of fields that way
pause whats coursing
the gypsies cant get enough of it
what the fucks a hare
i t s a big rabbit

because they call em hares
so whats coursing
they set two lurchers they are dogs before you ask on a hare thats the big rabbit
and the hare has to outrun the dogs
what happens if he doesnt
well the big rabbit gets fucked doesnt it
tommy looks a taken aback by this statement

yeah before the germans get there tommy
how can a dog fuck a rabbit
if eats the bastard
errol is curb crawling down a particularly seedy street in a car with john
they come to a halt at the feet of some touter
excuse me mate dya know mullet
the man looks a little further down the street
errol follow his eyes squints and seems to focus on something
errol puts on the gas a little the car surges forward and slows at the feet of mullet seedy looking character with big ears and a moody haircut who smokes
fat cheap cigars and wears his top shirt button fastened
hows the govnor
very well mullet i am sure hell be flattered you inquired

bounty black on the outside white on the inside
he was doing a job for a couple of brothers in smith street
i think it was a pawn shop
porn as in filthy dirty
pawn as in i have run out of money and heres my wedding ring
good boy mullet
turkish and tommy have found micky who is in the middle of a field and is betting on with various dodgy characters
well do you want to do it
on you buying this caravan
he pulls out a catalogue on fancy caravans and points to the picture of the rolls royce of caravans
thats not the same caravan
this isnt the same fight
i t s twice the fuckin size of the last one
the fight is twice the size
and my mum still needs a new caravan
micky you are lucky we arent worm food after your performance i think buying a tarts mobile palace is a little fuckin rich
there is a pause while micky frowns
turkish looks a little sheepish
i didnt mean that your mum was a tart
i just meant
save your breath for cooling your porridge
ill bet you for it
what like tommy did last time
do me a favour
i l l do you a favour you have first bet
if i win i get the caravan if i lose il l do the fight for free
turkish considers this uneasily
he looks at the dogs they look keen and fit
okay i reckon the hare gets caught
but hes in
gypsy romany music starts
cut to slow motion cu of dogs enthusiasm cu of pikeys and their fingers skillfully dealing in money inhaling cigarettes etc
errol and john are looking for tyrone
cut back to the dogs
the chase starts
they see tyrone tyrone starts to run
the hare sees the dogs and starts to run
they bail tyrone into the back of a car
the dogs move out in a pincer movement
poor tyrone is bleeding in the boot of a car
the dogs move in
they bail tyrone out of the car and into brick tops pub
brick top is waiting there
brick top asks questions
we cant hear what hes asking but we can see that tyrone isnt playing the game
the dogs are moving in
a door is opened and tyrone is thrown in
a rabid neapolitan mastiff pitbull hybrid that is attached to the end of a long pole with a lasso at the other end is brought in it will quite clearly
savage anything in its way
the hare gets caught and a pile of fur comes up the dog bites tyrone in the leg
tyrone shouts in panic the music breaks we come out of slow motion and into real time
ok ill fuckin tell you
the hare escapes the jaws of the dogs and is off
turkish is getting into his car
youre are as mad as mars you are why did you take that bet
what happens now
we buy him a caravan tommy
there is something very wrong with this it was us that wanted to buy a caravan off him
why didnt you bus a cap in his ass then tommy
mind you you would do more damage if you threw it at him
you saying i cant shoot
oh no tommy i wasnt saying you cant shoot i know you cant shoot
what i was saying is that six pound piece of shit stuck in your trousers there would do more damage if you fed it to em
are you saying it doesnt work
you tried it
that russian saves the shooters that work for the faces and i dont want to be the one that breaks it to you tommy but you aint a face
go on try it
tommy sticks the gun out the window and pulls the trigger
i want to see that sneaky fuckin russian
vin and sol are trying to wrap frankys body up
bad boy lincoln has been called in to help
what happened to him
he got shot in the face lincoln i would have thought that was obvious
well what do you want me to do about it
sort it out
the only way to sort it out is to bring him back to life and i am not a fuckin witch doctor am i
villains are supposed to know how to get rid of bodies
err yes but i have never actually got rid of one
who is he
hes a man with a hole in his face lincoln
who cares who he is
err well lets wrap him up
what do you want to do that for
hes not a fuckin christmas present
brick top is on the phone and errol and john sit opposite
like i said i wasnt giving you a choice
i am telling you that fuckin gypsy has got to fight
turkish is on the other end of the phone to brick top
tommy is trying to listen in to what is being said
i am sorry but hes a stubborn bastard he says hes had enough he says hes got to look after his old mum
are you taking the piss again
thats what he said shes a nice old girl his mum
youre on thin ice turkish and i am going to be there when it breaks
he puts the phone down and inhales
anything for an easy life
that fuckin pikey being difficult
hello we here
we see errol outside with a glass cutter
he puts it around the door and creates a circle with the sharp side pulls it out and puts his hand through to kill the alarm
you coming john
is a trouts head water proof errol
i wouldnt miss it for the world
get the governor john
john goes back to the car which is parked down the street
the window slides down
it looks like we are in gov
oh goodie gum drops
get us a cup of tea would you errol
vin lincoln and sol are arguing hold him by his legs
what do you think i am holding him by his fucking ears
the interconnecting door opens slowly
hope it s not a bad moment
sol looks at vin vin looks at lincoln they are understandably surprised
brick top looks around the room the silence continues
brick top helps himself to the most comfortable seat
do you know who i am
yeah i know
that will save me some time then
well i dont
what you gonna do with your man there
youre always gonna have problems lifting a body in one piece
apparently the best thing to do is cut the corpse up into six pieces and pile it all together
would someone mind telling me who you are
after you got six pieces you gotta get rid of em of course you cant just leave it in the deep freeze for your mum to discover can ya
pause while the black guys are still holding the body
the door opens and in walks errol
he passes brick top a cup of tea in a take away container
lincoln who is this man
and then i hear the best thing to do is feed em to pigs
you gotta starve the pigs for a few days then the sight of a chopped up body looks like curry to a drunk
you gotta shave the heads of your victims and pull the teeth out you could do that after of course but you dont want to go sieving pig shit do
ever seen the size of one of their molars
he holds up his fist they go through bone like i t s butter
you gotta have a few pigs though you need about sixteen they will go through a body that weighs two hundred pounds in about eight minutes that means that a
single pig can consume two pounds of uncooked flesh every minute
pause hence the expression greedy as a pig
pause well thank you thats a large weight off my mind
but would you mind very much telling me who the fuck you are
other than a man that feeds people to pigs of course
the door opens and we see john who is wearing a pair of extremely large plastic gloves showing brick top the shotgu that he has found
would you look at the size of this
golly that is big isnt it errol
he looks back at the brothers do you know what nemesis means
there is a pause a righteous infliction of retribution by
an appropriate agent personified in this case by a horrible cunt
brick top stands and opens the door
we can see that a coupl of ropes have been slung over the rafters and a couple of buckets are underneath them
six very large men including errol and john are standing around wanting to get busy
tyrone is with them all trussed up
bullet tooth tony is in front of hands rosebud and doug
can i call you tony
you can call me susan if it makes you happy
you got nice teeth susan
tony demonstrates an interest in rose buds
you dont you should comb em some time
hands interrupts tony i want to know if you can find me a man
well then it depends on all the elements in the equation how many are there
about forty thousand
where was he last seen
at a bookies
a bookies eh
susi pass us the blower
susi reaches for the phone
the black guys are hanging upside down
errol and john are now wearing industrial pinnies
is this how you want him gov
no spin him round i want him sunny side up
mr mclean i kid you not
why do you think we have a dead man missing an arm in our office
give us four days and we bring you a stone the size of a home
brick top considers this and has a look at errol who is more than enthusiastic to get on with the job at hand
what do you think errol
i think we should drip dry em governor while we have the chance
brick top again frowns at errol
it was a rhetorical question errol what have i told you about thinking
he turns back to the brothers
you got forty eight hours
he looks at lincoln
i am going to take your man here
pointing to tyrone
you can keep this silly wanker
shut it or ill cut ya
in forty eight hours i set the dogs on him and then the pigs on the remains
brick top nods at errol who looks extremely disappointed
btt and hands are driving along
rose bud is in the back
a bookies got blagged last night
i gotta see a man who looks like he might know something but it cant be done on the phone if you know what i mean
he turns to rose bud
i need a cun
no you dont rose bud my old son you need me
tyrone looks desperate
he set the dogs on me
he shows his wounds to sol and vin
no wonder that sneaky fuckin russian didnt want to do it
first things first one of us tyrone you get round to the russians
the second you see him call us
you better be round with something substantial dont turn up with a frown and a wagging finger
i am on it tyrone
btt is in the car with hands and rose bud
the car is parked at the feet of mullet who is in discussion with another horrible character
mullet is extremely nervous about seeing alright mullet
tony alright mate
well i thought you werent about anymore
well what do you know
its still warm the blood that courses through my veins
unlike yours mullet
t has a quick look down the street
this job does have prospects after all you travel to pretty places meet interesting people
btt looks at who mullet is talking to the man has a try hard mustache and interjects
who the fuck gave you such a big mouth
someone whom you might shortly meet
you threatening me
only with wings and a halo
mullet gives the man a furtive kick and makes eyes to shut up
clean the breakfast off your top lip and make yourself busy sunshine
the man moves off i want to know who blagged brick tops bookies
oh do me a favour tone
i will do you a favour mullet ill not bash the living fuck out of you in front of all your girlfriends here
i dont know anything about that tony
if you play hard to get mullet youll wish youd never been caught
mullet looks uncomfortable about the fact that hes thinking
j make it worth my while at least
jesus tone you know how it is
btt turns to hands
give us your wallet hands
hands makes eyes and digs into his back pocket and produces his wallet
btt takes out some notes and proffers them to mullet mullet nervously reaches forward
as quick as you like btt has mullet by the collar and pulls mullet into the car
he then raises the electric window on mullets throat until it has fastened mullet to the roof of the vehicle
mullet has already gone pink
you can take as long as you like mullet
btt starts to pull away so mullet has to keep walking with him
fuckin hell what are you doing
i am driving down the street with your head stuck in my window
what do you think i am doing you penis
he does the window up a bit tighter
and grabs him by the nose
he pulls a face when he smells his breath

he speeds up even more
err no i dont think il l slow down mullet i think i l l speed up
i could play you some music if you like
btt turns on the radio
a song comes on that he loves
oh i love this track
it could be tyrone conway
white geezer thinks hes black did a job for a pair of brothers who have a pawn shop in smith street
yes thats what i said
i t s fuckin tyrone conway
it may be fuckin him but wait and see what i can do to you
he puts his foot down and mullet loses his footing and is dragged along
he points to mullet
btt pulls an oh yes i forgot about him face
he doesnt even look at mullet
he lowers the window and mullet falls by the way in god knows what condition
the music continues and we have a montage of the black guys dealing with bullet tooth tony and hands as they arrive at the pawn shop
we see the corpse we see hands get irate and it looks like its going to be the end of the black fellas again
the black guys try to whip out the big gun but tony disarms them and takes the gun off them
the music ends along with the scene when sol breaks
its the russian well to be technical an uzbekistan
the sneaky dogs
i been doing business with those sneaky dogs
btt looks familiar with this name
dear oh dear you do know some horrible people
russians i didnt think it would be the russians
boris the blade
i heard of him isnt he supposed to be a short little fucker thats covered in scars
sneaky little shit one of the russian dissidents killed more men than
well hes killed a lot of men
deals in arms that he gets off some of the old school
we cut to the security monitor that observes the shop it sits on dougs desk
the door opens and in walks boris
as bold as brass he walks up to the counter
whats going on here
doug picks up the phone to the downstairs shop
susi picks up the receiver at the other end
what does that man want
i t s hard to say hes got a thick russian accent
they are obviously going to move in on the russian
hes a bit sneaky this fella so watch out
i hate russians
ill sort him out
hands and btt both look at rose bud and look relieved for the offer
hes all yours rose bud
micky is looking at his caravan its in flames real proper roaring flames
people are desperately trying to put the flames out
micky is covered in dirt from his futile efforts
one of the other pikies whos involved in trying to extinguish the fire turns round and sees micky standing there motionless
he can see hes upset
whats wrong with micky
his mam was in there patrick
they burnt his mam
all real sound recedes and we drift in to music
the camera slowly tracks in on micky
its hard to read how devastated he is
the camera reaches mickys face the reflections of the flames can be seen in his water swollen eyes but his cheeks remain dry
btt is driving hands in the passenger seat and rose bud in the back
btts got a bleeding eye and his hand is wrapped up in a bandage
rose bud is clutching his stomach
sneaky was a bit of a fuckin understatement wasnt it
what do you want me to do
your man there thought he could take him
i told you he was dangerous
how you doing rosey
hands looks at rose bud whos holding his midsection
youre going to have to get me to a hospital lets shoot that fucker
then get me to a hospital
we gotta get this stone first rosy and then well get you to a hospital
vin and sol are going through a selection of keys they have trying to open the front door
lincolns got some tools here when he has had a few drinks he gets em out and runs around the house holding a pistol in each hand telling me about
what a bad boy he is
do you know where he keeps em
they find the right key
well they aint gonna be lying on the kitchen table vince we gotta have to look
flick tlie switch
i t s dark they flick the switch
they look onto an immaculate pad
music fades up along with the lights
whats going on here
he likes his drum does bad boy lincoln
the dog goes bounding in
well lets get busy
btts car pulls up outside boris house
btt and rosebud pull boris up in the boot
tyrone who is hanging about nearb keeping watch witnesses this
rosebud places a blade at the russians neck
i think you have got something to tell us
take it easy rosy take it easy
btt looks at the blood thats already starting to pierce the skin from where the blade is pressed against the russians neck
btt then looks at hands with concern
you want him to be able to talk or not
sol and vin have found the weapons and are tossing them from hand to hand
i didnt know did i
they always looked the shit to me
what are we gonna do with em sol
shut your mouth vince this is all we got so this will have to do
sols mobile rings
boris is here
thats why i am calling you
were coming over
hold him there
sol puts the phone down before he has to hear what tyrone has to say
leave that dog here vince we gotta go
they shut the dog in the main room and go out of lincolns house
continuing after sols put the phone down hes not on his own
we cut to vinny and sol tearing round to boriss
theyre driving tyrones car
as they arrive tyrone jumps out in the middle of the road
they screech to a halt narrowly avoiding squashing tyrone
where is he
i t s not just a he there are three
of them in the house with him
why didnt you tell us tyrone
tyrone pulls a i tried face
do they look hard
they look fucked up
well get in and lets load up
vin whips out a gun
load them up with what
whats wrong with them
hold tight rudy are you fuckin mad
do you know who these people are
no i dont tyrone but i do know i dont want to be eaten by pulled apart by dogs and then eaten by fuckin pigs
tommy and turkish are looking on to the burned out caravan
they are in shock
there is a whole gathering of dodgy angry looking pikies standing around giving turkish and tommy some bad looks
jesus i am sorry micky
i am really sorry
hes a mad bastard
darren decides to interject
who are these the boys micky
darrens eyes are full of poison
tommy and turkish suddenly feel very uncomfortable
back off darren
what kind of cunt would turn up here if they knew what had happened
leave my business to me boy
darren spins on his heel i got a message that he wanted me to fuck you two off thats why i wanted you back
i l l do the fight before he causes any more carnage but i l l only do it if youre there
because i know he fuckin hates ya
turkish and tommy are driving
turkish is drinking a pint of milk as usual
there is silence for a while
its not warm the blood in his veins is it
i gotta say
dont like this tommy
this has got very fuckin messy
jesus you know how he felt about his old girl
i think we should get you a new gun tommy but this time try
how far is the russians
well be there in a minute
he takes a sip of his milk
theres a pause
its not the same
milk in these cartons
you shouldnt drink that stuff any way
why whats wrong with it
its not in synch with evolution
cows have only been domesticated in the last eight thousand years before that they were running around mad as lorries
the human digestive system hasnt got used to any dairy products yet it takes a lot longer than that
well fuck me tommy what have you been reading
cows mad as lorries eh
you hear about the two cows having a chat in a field
one says to the other what do you think about this mad cows disease then
the other one looks back and says doesnt bother me im a duck
turkish looks back at him blankly
here let me do you a favour
he reaches over and grabs the carton from turkish and throws it out the window
the milk obviously hits an on coming car in the other direction
there is a terrible crashing noise
tommy and turkish come to a standstill and look back to see a small pile up on the other side of the road
what was in that milk
btt hands and rose bud are standing over a safe
they are looking at a whole pile of money
the case is open and hands is holding the stone
hes a sneaky fucker that russian
well shall we go
what you want to do about the russian
i want to bury him
hands tony and rosebud walk out
the black guys witness this
tyrones now in the front seat driving
well come on lets have em
pause while they consider this
well come on
not so fast vin we cant get em now we gonna have to follow them
b tts car moves off
the black guys follow
i l l move in
itll be ok
ok is very close to ko and ko is close to r
you know what rip stands for tyrone
it stands for
it stands for
shut your fuckin mouth tyrone and leave the talking to us
lets get these ready
do they fire
pointing to the guns
of course they fuckin fire
how do you know
theyre replicas what do you know about replicas
sol looks at the gun and frowns what does he know about replicas
he pulls the trigger
he fires one shot
it is very loud the gun goes off near tyrones ear he buckles in pain
the car does a massive swerve and everything nearly ends in disaster all the windows shatter including the windshield but the glass stays put
tyrone regains some control over the car
what the fuck do you think youre doing sol
jesus i didnt know it was that loud
well just how fuckin loud did you think it was going to be
its a fucking gun sol guns are renowned for making a loud fucking noise whenever you pull the trigger
you wanted to see if they worked
i didnt mean try it in the fuckin car sol
well they work i reckon they are really going to put the shits into em
right now i am not concerned with putting the shits into em sol i am
concerned about taking the pain out of my ringing fucking ears
look what you did to poor tyrone
tyrone you alright
he taps tyrone on the shoulder
tyrone looks up
are you alright
tyrone spins in his seat and answers a little too loudly
i am fuckin deaf
what have you done to my car
they crash into the car in front
boris the blade comes flying through the windshield
this scene runs concurrently with scene how we going to get rid of him
you want to shoot him
i t s a bit noisy isnt it
well you want to stab him
thats a bit cold blooded isnt it
you want to kill him or not
i cut him
thats the spirit
theres a sword back there
he points to behind a seat there is a bloody great sword concealed
tony skillfully passes the sword to rose budd who attempts to pull it out of its scabbard
tony turns round to hands
you you want a knife
he passes hands a knife
i wouldnt know what to do with it
its not a fuckin rocket launcher
its a knife for gods sake what have you used for to keep your fork company for all these years
its got a sharp side and a blunt side
you want a lesson
there is a sudden bang on the windshield and btt turns back to the front only to see the windshield covered in milk
tony cant see where he is going and searches for the windshield wipers
while this is happening the car swerves to the side and hits a lamp post
they crash and the boot trunk has flown open and boris the blade tries to lift himself out
rose bud looks down at the sword he has been extracting he can see he very nearly cut himself in two
tony pulls himself up from the steering wheel he has a trickle of blood running down his face
theres a crash and a car hits em from behind
they too are recovering from the accident
and boris has now come headfirst through the windshield
you idiot what have you done
is that boris
we hit something and something hit us
he turns and sees that rose bud has got a sword sticking though him
its gone through him and the seat that he is sitting on
lets hit em now
the is a dead russian on my lap sol i am not thinking about hitting anybody right now
well you better start thinking vince because otherwise youll be fuckin lucky if you end up looking like that
no i am about a rocket ride from right tony
i mean do you feel alright
ohh yeah i feel like i am lying on the naked lap of aphrodite cooled by the tumbling petals of spring roses how the fuck do you think i feel
hold tight big man and put your guns away
lets get going
what about rose bud
well you can bring him with you if you want but which bit do you want to bring
they are getting out
well get down the last thing we want him to see is three brothers wearing ski masks
btt and hands covered in blood walk off the street into a cafe
i gotta clean up
he goes out the back while btt goes to the pay phone to call doug
the black guys pile out of the car and follow btt and hands at a safe distance
btt is on the phone doug we are in the shit come and pick us up
tommy and turkish pull up outside boris house
hes left the door open
i shouldnt think thats a good idea
shall we have a look
i dont want to go in there hes a dangerous bastard taken too many disco biscuits in the heat of russian disputations hes got as many of these nuts as
he grabs his groin and circles his finger and his temple i dont care if hes got fuckin hazel nuts i want a gun that works
well come on then before the germans get here
the black guys have followed btt and hands and are waiting outside readying themselves for action
now tyrone you go
tyrone oi tyrone
tyrone cant hear a thing
i never forgive you sol
sol taps tyrone on the shoulder
when we get in you wait by the door i am number one vin number two and you are number three
the black guys enter
btt has just finished his phone call and sat down
i dont want a fuss and i dont want to put a bullet in your face but unless you give me exactly what i want there will be murders
btt shakes his head in amazement
number three pull the blind down
tyrone cant hear this request
lo number three he said pull the blind down
he still cant hear him
this is minorly embarrassing
ill sort it
excuse me but who the fuck are you
you hear what
stand up unless youre crippled
do i look crippled
youll look fucking dead unless you stand up
sol cocks the gun and tony pulls a sarcastic i am shocked face
you got ballsl you want to test em
there are two types of balls there are big brave balls and there are little mincy faggot balls
youre a dead man talking
these are your last words so make them a prayer
vinny takes aim
so youre obviously the big dick and they on either side of you must be your balls
vin goes to hit him with the gun but its caught by tony vin tries to pull the nose out of tonys hand but he cant move it
sol steps forward and raises his gun
let go of the gun
vinny cocks his gun
there is a pause and eventually tony lets go of it
i am talking for your benefit
now dicks have drive and clarity of vision
tony starts to build himself a complicated looking weapon under the table unseen by the black guys
he takes bits out of one sock and bits out of another sock
but theyre not clever they smell pussy and they want a piece of the action and the dimmer the dick the less he cares about the consequences and you thought
you smelt gooood ol pussy and have brought your little mincy faggot balls along for a gooood ol time but you have got your parties muddled up there is no pussy here just a dose to make you wish you were born a woman
we cut to the shell shocked brothers and the almost completely built weapon
and just like a prick you are having second thoughts youre shrinking and your little balls are shrinking with you
they stare on
the brothers have lost this one and they know it
they start to reverse
btt lets the odd chicken cluck out the corner of his mouth vinny misses his step and waves his gun about in a futile effort to look mean
they back away into the corridor down to the back door of the cf
ae and just as they turn the corner they bump into hands still drying his hands they can see that hes carrying a case that they recognize
the brothers adapt to their new scenario pass it me
btt can hear that the black guys and hands have run into each other and pulls out the complicated looking gun which is now in one piece
btt cocks the gun and aims it at the wall which the brothers would be behind he follows the wall simulating the speed of their journey
i wont ask again he raises his gun
a covey of bullets perforates the wall one hitting vin in the hand
the brothers take the opportunity to duck
hands dives for cover too and drops the bag
a continuation of bullets comes flying through the wall
the black guys take the opportunity to pick the bag up and leg it
the brothers are standing in front of brick top they move uneasily from foot to foot
brick top examines the stone
he looks up
quite a lump
alright you can go now
any chance of taking lincoln with us
thats where errols taking ya
ill continued they turn and errol is waiting for them
they go out of one room into another and errol shuts the door behind them
vin looks uncomfortable
another door is opened and a man brings out lincoln
lincoln is in bad shape and is relieved to see familiar faces they are now shut in a room
you alright lincoln
do you know why the governor is the governor
i t s because people are scared of him
you know why they are scared of him
its because of stories
i am sure youve heard one or two of those stories
for example did you hear about the three black fellas that did a very bad thing however they made some effort to redeem that very bad thing so the governor
saw fit not to kill em
he thought it would be a more advantageous concept to let them kill each other and let the survivor live to tell the tale
that way everybody wins well all except the two that died of course
we look at the table where we see three large kitchen knives sitting provocatively
tyrone rushes for one of the blades grabs it and runs at vin vin sidesteps and tyrone keeps running straight into the arms of errol who raises his gun at
the last moment
tyrone slides the blade into errol s ribs and errol fires a shot straight at tyrone
the bullet passes through tyrone and hits john in the throat
vin lincoln and sol are left wondering what the fuck has just happened
the gun you prick
sol goes for one and vin goes for the other
there is a wake in motion
we cut to micky and turkish
it is obvious that a lot of hard core drinking has been going on and there is an irish band playing
the is a coffin in the middle of a caravan that is closed for obvious reasons i t s surrounded by heavy looking lads
the is a man dancing on one of the tables
all three black guys are sitting in front of btt and hands and doug
there is silence as the white guys have just been told something disturbing
btt eventually breaks the silence well you gotta admire their balls
i dont want to admire balls that i want to chop off
what choice did we have
i know sorry doesnt mean fuck all but we are game on what do you want us to do
get us that stone back
so brick top has now got the stone
hes got it
you wouldnt be lying to us would you now
why should we
could just have disappeared
cut to hands whos thinking
btt and hands are at the bar
you got some front coming round here aint ya tony
never mind what i got i am looking for brick top
you mean mr mclean
you know who i mean you fucking fringe now find him
pause the barman looks truculent
the barman walks down the end of a bar and picks up the phone
what was it you did exactly tony
i had a little run in with a few of the chaps
how s that
theyre all brainless they got white powdered angels sitting on their shoulders telling them what was what all too busy
he sticks his finger by the side of his nose and inhales
if they werent sniffing the dust they where flicking the ash
and never trust who puts anything other than a finger up his nose
ken another of brick tops men appears from somewhere and approaches tony with another heavy sean
they do and end up in a corridor
shuts behind them and the door in front hasnt yet opened
ken turns around and faces tony
did you know that it was my cousin lorrie you stabbed
there is a pause
the situation is volatile
yes i know i stabbed a man called lorrie but no i didnt know he was related to a tub a shit
ken knows its on
shut that door sean
lock that fuckin door sean
btt takes a step forward and puts his hand into the back of his trousers
he starts to growl
youre a big man but i dont care if youre ten foot fuckin tall you still got eight pints of blood and youll bleed like any bastard
ya and i will fuckin drop ya ill open you up like a packet of crisps
pause to take in what has just been said then he continues
youre a bully ken but remember i am a bigger bully
the door opens and they are interrupted by another heavy
ha ken what s going on
bring em through
the governor wants to see em
ken is relieved by the interruption and he leads the way with a truculent youre lucky stare
they enter brick tops office
i gotta say you have got some front coming round here tone you know the lads are picking straws
interrupted you gotta diamond and it doesnt belong to you it belongs to my colleague here
thats what i love about you tone no small talk
i said we should come round and raise fuckin hell you know shoot a few of the boys and that but he said he thinks we would have more success
if we paid for it
so i am going to have a drink and let you two discuss what you have to discuss
btt walks to the bar
ken is sitting there with sean
alright big man i hope you arent bitter about your cousin lorrie
if you listen carefully you will hear a slight zip of flies being undone
you know youre alright when theyre are talking business i d like to see you gob off outta here
ohh do me a favour ken youve always been mouth and no trousers
we cut back to brick top and hands i l l pay for it i wont pay you the top fuckin whack but youll never get that anyway
you got it
i cant sell you something i havent got now can i
btt returns to them there is a scream from ken youre a dead fuckin man
you listen to me tony youre a dead fuckin
brick top frowns at ken and ken shuts up quickly
what did you do to upset ken tony
tony shrugs hes pissed in my fuckin pocket look
ken shows off a wet sided jacket and a damp set of trousers
do shut up ken
that was a bit naughty tony
brick top puts his hands in to his pocket and withdraws the stone
we cut to hands expression
well come on lets have a look
brick top passes the stone to hands
all goes quiet while everybody focuses on the stone
hands lifts it up to his eye
what are you playing at
he drops the stone it smashes on the ground
its a zirconia
we crash track in to brick tops expression of shock
the four black guys are trying to pick the lock of the vault having been locked in it by bullet tooth hands and doug
i changed the stone
i changed it
i know brick top knows nothing about stones
yes but doug the fuckin head does
yeah well i didnt expect them to lock us up in here did i
ohh your one clever bastard vin you really are
where is it
its at lincolns
what the fucks it doing at my place
waiting for us to pick it up
what happen if they find that its a fake stone vince
well we are going to get fucked sol what do you think is going to happen
the door opens
ohh yes you are going to get fucked vince
a distant voice is shouting oi micky
we fade out of black to mickys pov
thisis shot in slow motion
micky opens his eyes in the backof
a large van there is only one faint light that moodilyilluminates his tired eyes
you feeling alright micky
ive felt better
we are nearly there
they are a horrible bunch this lot micky so pay attention to what you are doing
micky just yawns
put up some kind of a show hes a hard bastard this good night anderson so dont get too clever he used to be a pro
just keep moving round the ring and let the odd one go when push has come to shove
lets get on with it shall we
a temporary ring has been erected four scaffolding posts with welded on hoops make the arena the ropes that are threaded through the hoops are industrial nylon and free of
around the ropes its starting to fill
brick top approaches salt pete and jack the all seeing eye
i hope we gonna get a better show this time
this will make up for it
mickys going down in the fourth
terry over there is in charge of the bets
now youll have to forgive me
brick top leaves with ken
have we got the lads at the camp site
yeah they are there
cut to a shot of some of brick tops heavies waiting in a car outside the campsite
wheres that fuckin pikey
brick top is standing in front of micky whose eyes are still semi open
whats wrong with you
is he fuckin stoned
hes like that before a fight
he turns his attention to micky
now you know when youre going down
of course he knows when hes going down
hey fuck face whos speaking to you
he asked him didnt he
i like that i l l have to use that one next time i want to impress your mum ken
or was it the fifth
theres a campsite full of pikies that might not think youre so fuckin funny when they are putting the flames out on their childrens backs
cut to a shot of brick tops boys lighting a cigarette in the car outside the pikies
micky appears from a small door at the back of the warehouse
he approaches the ring accompanied with shouts of encouragement and counter shouts
hes wearing a pair of semi cut tracksuit bottoms and a t shirt with grease marks down the front
turkish walks behind him micky still looks bored
he climbs into the ring
then from the same door as the one through micky came out walks a larger character with a nose that appears to have seen countless rounds with a frying pan
horace good night anderson
alright lads no eye gouging no biting
do your worst
back to your corners
we drift again into mickys pov his world is becoming more and more surreal
he can faintly hear turkish whispering words to him but hes not really listening
a bell comes from somewhere and micky instinctively walks to the center of the ring
good night is already there they pace one another for a second or two micky avoids a punch or two and then he takes a hard one and he knows
it we flash to white mickys in trouble he lets one of his missiles go and bang it shakes good night to his core all goes quiet
we go to super slow motion his knees buckle and good night is in trouble
micky maintains a frown as he watches his opponents knees threaten to betray him
the crowd tries to digest what is happening
after a period of silence reality dawns
brick top mouths the words in silence
don t go down you fucker
the crowd wants micky to finish the job
but common sense reins back the coup de grace
good night eventually regains control of his legs and stumbles forward after a few sleepy punches he starts to provide a serious onslaught
i dont like the look of this tommy bring the van up to the back door
this goes on for two rounds which is montage down to a few seconds
we go in the mind of poor micky
we break the music just as its starting to look dangerous
the bell goes and micky walks to the wrong corner
turkish pulls him back to his corner
they are on ya
you got to hurt him micky
otherwise we are rumbled
you hear me micky
do something it looks like it s rigged
micky goes out again his hands are low bang there is a flash of white as micky goes down in the dirt
dust rises from where he fell
he gets up quickly his hands are still low bang he goes down again in no time hes up
bang he hits the ground again and this time when he hits the deck he penetrates the dust covered floor like i t s made out of water
he falls through the water like hes sinking his eyes are open and he cant breathe he continues to fall but hes unpanicked he is now micky
when micky looks up he can see himself in the corner of the ring takin kidney punches from good night hes winded and only semi conscious this is micky
micky makes the effort to swim up and tries to penetrate the floor but hes stuck he cant get through
micky takes more punishment in the ring as micky s hand continues to try to break the underside of the floor but it stretches like rubber and forces micky down
micky looks up again and sees how much trouble micky s in the ring
micky is panicking now hes running out of oxygen and micky s being beaten micky starts to sink again but now flames tickle the bottom of his feet he looks
and sees micky being smashed to hell his body eventually collapses and micky falls through the floor
and as the latter falls through micky manages to rise from the depths and his punch manages to perforate the surface
the punch continues its trajectory and has the power to fell a red blooded rhino
it catches good night on the jaw and its good night for good night its unlikely that hell awake in the next hour
dear oh dear everybody is in trouble
again we cut to the reactions of the relevant parties
tommy get the van
i have it its waiting
turkish jumps into the ring and grabs micky
we are off micky hold tight and move quickly
turkish pulls micky away
its not as hard as it might be trying to get out because the crowd seems to have found its own disputes chairs start to fly
brick tops boys are frustrated in the mayhem
brick top calmly dials into his mobile telephone
darren picks up the phone
if you would you like to speak to your friends youll have to speak a little louder
we pull back to see four slumped heads in the car and blood staining the windscreen
brick top calmly puts the phone down
right lets get outta here
brick top is looking every which way and trying to get out of there accompanied by ken
wheres the car ken
i t s coming now
we are outta here
they come out of a side entrance their car pulls round the corner and screeches to a halt
brick top opens the door as he is about to get in hes eyes widen to the size of saucers as four men who we recognize from the wake are
sitting in the place of his driver
they both have sawed off shotguns and empty four barrels into the chest of brick top and ken
the car spins away leaving their twitching bodies on the dirt
hands doug and bullet tooth have vin sol and bad boy lincol in tow
they look at the front room of lincolns house
very nice lincoln
veeeery nice lincoln
well where is it
they open the door
this room is a complete mess
all the colony leather has been chewed up beyond recognition
they all grimace at the smell
the dog comes running up look what your dogs done to my leather
its a bit funky in here
btt opens a window
the dog looks extremely relieved to see someone
you keep a good house lincoln
so wheres this stone
it was over there
he points to a pile of chewed up cushions
we left it in a box over there
he walks over and finds the remains of the box
i t s empty
dear oh dear
hes not fuckin about we left it there
it must be in the dog
all eyes focus on the dog
well lets have a look shall we
oy all eyes focus on tony
have a vlook in the dog
what do you mean have a look in the dog
i mean open him up
tony is not sure about this
i t s not a fuckin tin of baked beans what do you mean open him up
i mean open him up
hands does a movement that represents a knife across the throat
thats a bit strong isnt it
you wouldnt have a problem if it was a person
but its not its a dog and i have never done a dog
my heart bleeds
there is another pause what dp i do
let me take a wild and reckless guess
stick a knife in his guts and see if its got a diamond in there
ill hold it still andyou open it up
tony looks positively unsure and rocks his head from side to side
fuckin hell alright then
you cant do that
well do it to you as well if it makes you feel any better
cut to tony having some problems trying to get hold of the awkward dog
the dog starts to squeak
tony passes the blade to hands
i t s squeaking
what youve never heard a dog squeak before
hold him still
the dog isnt sure about this either
vin is in a panic and suddenly
i can see it
i can see the stone
hands at the point of entry stops
vinny hops over to the stone and picks it up
tony lets the dog stand but keeps a grip oh the collar
the dog is relieved to be semi liberated
hands is still on his knees armed with an incredulous stare
well lets see it
vinny holds it up
theres a sense of relief
he then throws the stone it cuts through the air
and the dog seeing another projectile runs to intercept it
theres a pause while all now focus again on the dog
this is digested literally and mentally
the dog recognizes all the attention its receiving
and goes through the motions of swallowing it
hands attempts an approach
the dog understandably feels uncomfortable about the advancing vanguard and decides emergency action is needed and seeing the open window launches itself out of it
the pikies have moved overnight
well this is where they were
well they arent fuckin here now are they
and i cant see a dog can you
they cant be far
hands btt and the black guys are back on the road

just then they see some caravans in the distance

all the caravans are fastened to the back of cars
