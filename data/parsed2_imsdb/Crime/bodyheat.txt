flames in the night sky
pulling back we see that the burning building is mostly hidden by dense black shapes that define the oceanside skyline of miranda beach florida
were watching from across town
the sound of a bathroom shower comes to a dripping stop at about the same time we see the naked back and head of ned racine
we continue to pull back into racine dressed in undershorts is standing on the small porch off his apartment on the upper floor of an old house
racine lights a cigarette and continues to stare off at the fire
weve passed him now into the bedroom of the apartment and the shape of a young woman angela flashes by drying her body with a towel
my god its hot
i stepped out of the shower and stared sweating again
its still burning
jesus its bigger
and i thought you were making me hear those sirens
she giggles what is it
the seawater inn
my family used to eat dinner there twenty five years ago
now somebodys torched it to clear the lot
angela reappears briefly gathering her clothes
she sits on an unseen bed to get dressed
thats a shame
probably one of my clients
back still turned its four a
on the bed angela snaps on her bra

i wouldnt mind having breakfast

she is in fact slipping on the blouse of her avis rent a car uniform
theres a smile on her lips as she buttons up watching racine
youve had your fun
trying for a straight face ill just slip into my uniform here and slip away
my historys burning up out here
hey i dont mind
why do they make these damn skirts so hard to zip
now for the first time racine turns to look at her
she is sitting on the edge of the bed half into her uniform
racine smiles broadly at the sight and moves into the room
he pushes her back and they both disappear from sight fabric rustling
wheres your hat
giggling dont wrinkle it
whered you hear that
we are left looking out over the porch at the night
and we go back there across the rooftops to the flames
an assistant county prosecutor named peter lowenstein has been conferring at the bench with judge costanza and now they both wait as racine comes into view to join them
the judge is irritated
racine i do no longer care whether these alleged toilets were converted to pdf by www
ever actually en route from indiana or not
i think were wasting our time here
its pretty clear your client has attempted to defraud the county in a not very ingenious manner
he nods at lowenstein the assistant prosecutor has made what i consider a generous offer
and given that youve failed to generate even the semblance of a defense judge costanza perhaps when ive presented all yeah yeah
if i were you id recommend to your client that held quickly do as mr
lowenstein here has suggested plead nolo contendre file chapter eleven and agree never to do business with okeelanta county again
racine is surprised and pleased
you would look favorably on that
nods he can walk
but dont test my patience for even five more minutes
if he hesitates ill nail him
ill talk to him
racine starts to turn
next time you come into my courtroom i hope youve got either a better defense or a better class of client
thank you your honor
racine goes back to his client a businessman of enormous confidence and extravagantly untrustworthy appearance
converted to pdf by www
racine and lowenstein are seated at the counter
racine drinks beer while lowenstein drinks a tall iced tea very rapidly and signals for another
this place is across the street from the courthouse police station and there are plenty of lawyers and cops around several of whom acknowledge lowenstein and racine with pats or
a single unit air conditioner is blowing away above the door but it cant compete with the blasts of hot air that come in with each new patron
all of these people like the pedestrians outside the window have stripped down to essentials in the infernal heat
the lawyers all carry their jackets but even so their shirtsleeves are sweaty
the town is sizzling
i think ive underestimated you ned
i dont know why it took me so long
youve started using your incompetence as a weapon
smiles my defense was evolving
you guys got scared
costanza doesnt like me
whatd i do to him
hes an unhappy man thinks he should be circuit court by now
here he is in a state with really top notch corruption and hes stuck with the county toilets
he drinks im surprised you werent in on that toilet caper
could have been that quick score youve always been searching for
maybe costanza was in on it
thats why he was mad
stella the owner of the coffee shop writes and places separate checks in front of the two men
whats the word from the hallowed halls of justice
maybe stella was in on it
finished his tea stella when you gonna get a real air conditioner in here
converted to pdf by www
you dont like it theres lots of other places
they dont have you
he stands fishing for change but racine takes his check and places it with his own
lowenstein nods and moves for the door
you cant buy me
no sirree i dont come cheap
just before he reaches the door he does a strange thing he takes several graceful dance steps in the astaire manner
lowenstein youre a fag
lowenstein spins out the door where he is blasted by the heavy air
his body droops as he disappears
why does he do that
hes pretty good thats the weird part
did you hear about dr
do i want to
leans toward him confidential agnes marshall
the thought disgusts him that must have been mrs
blocks idea some kind of punishment
howd you know
christ youre plugged in better than me
so you must know about mrs
blocks friend in ocean grove
racine winces gets up and puts money on the counter
he lights a cigarette
converted to pdf by www
stella this is beneath even you
things must be slow
stella agrees with a shrug as racine heads for the door
its the heat
racine makes his way up first to the corner of main and crosses diagonally to his building on main
he is well known here greeted through glass by many of the shop owners
the heat dominates much of the pantomimed conversation
racine goes in a doorway and heads up the stairs to his office
racines secretary beverly is behind the desk in the modest reception room
shes a pretty girl barely past twenty
she pushes some phone message slips toward racine and nods toward the sofa
a middle aged woman client mrs
singer sits there clutching a walking stick
her face suddenly is contorted in pain
racine glances meaningfully at beverly then turns his full solicitous charm on mrs
singer i would have gladly come to the house
he helps her up and leads her slowly to his office
no the doctor says i should walk and i had some shopping
not that that quack knows what hes talking about
i tell you mr
racine im not sure his testimony is going to be very useful
dont worry about it
ill find you a doctor whos more understanding
is it bad today
oooh you cant imagine
nothing can make up for the pain theyve caused me
how well i know
well sue those reckless bastards dry
excuse my language
converted to pdf by www
singer disappears into the office racine flashes a grin at beverly
thats the kind of attitude youve got to have these days
the hottest january in fifty years has brought the crowds to the beach in search of relief
but theyve been disappointed
even the breeze off the ocean seems blown from a hair dryer
still the nights are a trifle better and the beachfront the penny arcades the ice cream stands and bars are busy even now in the middle of the week
racine comes out of a bar and lights a cigarette idly watching the passing parade
there is a free band concert in progress at the band shell
racine wanders in that direction
the miranda beach high school orchestra is playing to a full sweating house the audience is a sea of orange programs fluttering away as fans
people come and go frequently
the atmosphere is as innocent and informal as the music the band is playing now
racine leans against the back rail smoking his eyes playing over the scene with no expectations
then down near the center aisle a woman rises
as the band plays on this extraordinary beautiful woman in a simple white dress moves down the aisle
she moves wonderfully
the dress clings to her body in the heat
racine watches mesmerized as she walks directly toward him
she passes within a few inches of him her eyes lowered
racines body sways a moment as she goes by as though buffeted by some force
but they do not touch
she goes out onto the beachfront walkway
the woman matty has walked to the rail
she stands there now lighting a cigarette
she presents her face to the ocean hoping for a breeze
we move in on her with racine
racine lights a new cigarette and smiles at her
she looks at him and for an instant her eyes race over his body then she looks back at the ocean
converted to pdf by www
you can stand here with me if you want but youll have to agree not to talk about the heat
she looks at him and there is something startling about the directness of her gaze
when she speaks she is cool without being hostile
im a married woman
meaning im not looking for company
she turns back toward the ocean
then you should have said im a happily married woman
thats my business
how happy i am
and how happy is that
she looks at him curiously
she begins walking slowly along the rail
he walks too
youre not too smart are you
racine shakes his head no
i like that in a man
what else you like ugly
i got em all
you dont look lazy
converted to pdf by www
tell me does chat like that work with most women
if they havent been around much
thought maybe i was out of touch
she stops again at the rail as a small breeze blows in from the ocean
she turns her back to it and with her cigarette dangling from her lips she uses both hands to lift her hair up off her nape
she closes her eyes as the air hits her
racine watches very closely
how bout i buy you a drink
i told you
ive got a husband
ill buy him one too
hes out of town
my favorite kind
well drink to him
he only comes up on the weekends
matty lets her hair fall and again begins moving down walkway
she drops her cigarette and steps on it
im liking him better all the time
you better take me up on this quick
in another forty five minutes im going to give up and walk away
you want to buy me something
ill take one of these
they have come upon a vendor selling snow cones
converted to pdf by www
to vendor make it two
the vendor scoops and pours as racine lays some change on the cart
to matty youre not staying in miranda beach
she shakes her head no i would have noticed you
is this town that small
racine hands her a snow cone
they walk over to the rail
racine watches her eat the snow cone with enormous interest
youre staying up in pinehaven on the waterway
she gives him a look surprised you have a house
howd you know
you look like pinehaven
how does pinehaven look
she looks out at the ocean
yes im well tended all right
what about you
i need tending
i need someone to take care of me
rub my tired muscles
smooth out my sheets
i just need it for tonight
converted to pdf by www
for the first time matty laughs
a moment later she spills the snow cone over the front of her dress
it makes a bright red stain against the white
the thin material clings to the line of her breast
nice move matty
i like it
right over your heart
at least its cool
im burning up
i asked you not to talk about the heat
would you get me a paper towel or something
dip it in some cold water
racine starts toward the restroom nearby
ill even wipe it off for you
you dont want to lick it
this causes a momentary hitch in racines retreat but then he hurries off
racine comes in snaps some paper towels from the rack and turns on the water
the room is full of smoke
a fifteen year old boy is leaning against the wall
after looking racine over a second he brings the smoking joint hes been holding behind his back into view and takes a toke
he nods at racine who nods back and stands up with his wet towels
as he walks out racine takes a deep breath
racine comes out of the structure
matty is gone
racine looks around without much hope
finally he puts a wet paper towel to the back of his neck
we begin to hear a strange measured thumping and then racine is running
the thumping is the sound of racines battered running shoes hitting the weathered wooden planks of the boardwalk
converted to pdf by www
racine wears old gym shorts and a torn tee shirt with f
fading from the front
the raised wooden walk works its crooked way through lush tropical vegetation first coming close to the wide white beach then jutting back inland swallowed by greenery then shooting out
again toward the sea
racine hits this last stretch at top speed and launches himself flying out onto the gleaming sand
racine is running on the sand now on a raised hardened section that bisects the beach
his shoes make a weird whooshing sound each time they break the compacted surface and sink an inch below
the sun is just rising from the ocean to his right yet the day is already broiling
racines shirt is drenched
the whooshing is hypnotic steady his expression indicates that it is just this sound which keeps him going
further on racine runs by the band shell where hed seen matty
the thumping returns as racine runs the long straight pier directly out to sea toward the rising sun
a lifeguard boat with an outboard motor is on the left of the pier
racine watches it as he runs until it disappears beneath him then reappears on his right and turns out to sea so that it is running beside him
racine speeds up really kicking racing the boat to the end of the pier
the lifeguard on board isnt even aware of racine but he beats the runner nonetheless then veers off to continue his business
racine pulls up breathing hard
he walks it off a bit watching the boat then turns and starts walking back along the pier
he reaches into the waistband of his shorts and takes out a pack of cigarettes
racine is behind the desk
occupying the two seats in front are a married couple rapidly approaching divorce
they are arguing now each trying to convince racine of their view
racine nods occasionally looking from one to the other
but he is also looking between them through the open door out to the reception room where his secretary beverly is kneeling before the lowest drawer of a filing cabinet
her back is turned and her jeans are tight across the bottom
theres nothing especially provocative about her pose
shes just there
converted to pdf by www
racine walks across his office and closes the door
he goes back to his seat
the couple continues
another concert going on a trio of musicians
racine moves down the sidewalk away from the audience
he looks around as he lights a cigarette
she is nowhere in sight
racine opens the door to his car a nicked up red stingray
racine drives past a neat sign you are entering please drive carefully theres money here
many of the homes are not visible from the street only their gates announce their presence
those that can be seen are sprawling and lavish
the waterway appears to the left
a large white yacht cruises slowly by
racine sits in bed smoking a cigarette
at the mirror a nurse in a fresh white uniform steps into her white shoes and begins attaching her cap with bobby pins
the place is half full
matty is drinking at the end of the bar her cigarettes next to her glass
the bar chairs near her are empty
racine comes in looks around walks over and sits in the seat next to her
she looks up surprised
look whos here
isnt this a coincidence
racine looks at her almost as though he cant place her
but he doesnt push that effect hard
he lights a cigarette
i know you
youre the one that doesnt want to talk about the heat
id tell you about my chimes
what about them
converted to pdf by www
the wind chimes on my porch
they keep ringing and i go out there expecting a cool breeze
thats what theyve always meant
but not this summer this summer its just hot air
do i remind you of hot air
the bartender has come up
bourbon any kind on the rocks
to matty another
she thinks then nods her agreement
the bartender moves away
what are you doing in pinehaven
im no yokel
why i was all the way to miami once
there are some men once they get a whiff of it theyll trail you like a hound
the bartender brings their drinks and leaves
im not that eager
what is your name anyway
offers his hand ned racine
she takes his hand and shakes it
racine reacts strangely to her touch and doesnt let go right away
she gently frees it then refers to his look as she picks up her drink are you all right
converted to pdf by www
my temperature runs a couple degrees high
around all the time i dont mind it
its the engine or something
maybe you need a tune up
dont tell me you have just the right tool
i dont talk that way
howd you find me ned
racine gives her a look
this is the only joint in pinehaven
howd you know i drink
you seemed like a woman with all the vices
smiles you shouldnt have come
youre going to be disappointed
racine looks out over his drink
several of the men in the place are looking at them
referring to the men whatd i do
indicating racines chair a lot of them have tried that seat
youre the first one ive let stay
spotting a few more you must come here a lot
most men are little boys
converted to pdf by www
maybe you should drink at home
maybe you shouldnt dress like that
this is a blouse and a skirt
i dont know what youre talking about
you shouldnt wear that body
natty leans back in her seat and glances down at herself
i dont like my body much
its never been right
racine has been looking at her body too
with her line he just laughs
matty watches him then leans over her drink
her tone is different
sometimes i dont know
i get so sick of everything im not sure i care anymore
do you know what i mean ned
hes not sure i know that sometimes the shit comes down so heavy i feel like i should wear a hat
matty laughs studies him
yeah thats what i mean
ratty drains her glass and stubs out her cigarette
i think ill get out of here now
im going home
ill take you
i have a car
converted to pdf by www
ill follow you
i want to see the chimes
you want to see the chimes
i want to hear them
she looks at him a long time
if i let you thats all
gestures his innocence im not looking for trouble
very serious i mean it
i like you
but my life is complicated enough
racine again accepts
this is my community bar
i might have to come here with my husband some time
would you leave before me
wait in your car
i know it seems silly
i dont know who were going to fool
youve been pretty friendly
she gives him a look and then slaps him hard
everyone turns toward them
steadily now leave me alone
she stands up takes her purse and her cigarettes and walks to the other end of the bar where she sits down
racine watches her with amazed eyes
he stands up and throws some money on the bar
angry lady you must be some kind of crazy
he stalks out of the bar
converted to pdf by www
close on his face as he drives
his look is intense expectant
hes feeling lucky as he watches up ahead
racines pov out the windshield
mattys shiny mercedes sel is gliding down the road ahead of him
she puts on the blinker slows and turns into a gated drive
the drive is canopied by heavy trees the vegetation crowding the road with a primeval lushness
the headlights create sinuous welcoming shadows
it is as though racine were entering some separate parallel jungle world
eventually the house comes into view
mattys car swings around in the parking area and stops
racine pulls the stingray up next to it facing the other way
he watches matty slide her long legs out of the car
she glances at racine and for an instant there is a hint of self consciousness under the weight of his gaze
we begin to hear the soft tinkling of chimes
racine follows closely behind matty as they go up the stairs
at the door matty turns suddenly and looks at racine
remember your promise
matty looks him over a moment then turns to unlock the door
matty comes in and puts her purse on a hall table as racine moves forward to look around
despite the night gloom its clear the place is expensively decorated in a manner entirely consistent with the exterior of the house
fine antiques carefully chosen fabrics and a meticulous selection of accessories have given the place the look of an affluent home of thirties america
and yet the overall effect is almost contemporary so burnished are the woods so fresh all the elements
just like my place
matty gives him a searching look then leads him up the stairs flipping on only an occasional light in their path
in the second floor hall matty moves to the front of the house
racine glances into the gloom that hides mattys bedroom
converted to pdf by www
she goes home nights
youre not nervous alone
matty pauses at the doors to the porch unlocking them and looks at racine as though she barely understands the question
the tinkling is distinct out here
matty and racine come out onto the porch
there are about thirty wind chimes of various lovely designs crystal metal wood hanging at intervals from the rim of the wide porch awning completely encircling matty and racine
halfway down the long lawn is a white gazebo
beyond it the waterway is shimmering in the moonlight
at the edge of the water is a small boat house
racine walks along under the chimes looking up at them
a smile plays across her face
he looks back at matty you do have chimes
he looks out at the boat house
a gazebo no out there
what is in there
racine moves back and stands very close to her
he looks at her in the moonlight but she concentrates on the distant water
converted to pdf by www
its a mess
theres a row boat a lot of lounge chairs
things like that
racine puts his hand up under her hair on her nape
she closes her eyes at his touch then moves away as though by an act of will to the door half opening it
i think you should go now
i just got here
youve seen them
racine steps toward her but she ducks inside and moves through the intermittent light of the hall and down the steps
racine follows her
matty stops at the entry hall leaning against the wall
you didnt bring me here to see your wind chimes
he puts an arm on each side of her caging her against the wall
she looks up at him
yes i did
i said what i meant
do you ever do that
not very often
he kisses her light on the forehead
again she reacts but fights it
i dont think you want me to go
he kisses her lightly on the nose
theres nothing to be afraid of
there is for me
converted to pdf by www
matty slips under his arms and quickly steps out the front door
she stands just outside watching him
racine shakes his head goes out there
racine stops next to matty
she doesnt move away
im sorry i shouldnt have lot you come
racine looks at her a long time
youre not so tough after all are you
she kisses him on the lips and steps quickly inside the front door
she closes it looks through the window at him then moves away
racine stands looking at the door a few moments
then he walks to his car
again he stops
he looks back at the house
the wind picks up a bit and the tinkling of the wind chimes gets louder
and then louder
racine goes back up onto the porch fast
he goes to the front door and looks through the window
matty is standing at the bottom of the stairs in the hall
she is looking directly at the front door
frozen in the spot
racine tries the door
he shakes it hard but its solid
he looks to his left
there are windows down the wall there
he moves to them
they go into the living room but their shutters are closed
he looks through a broken slat at matty who watches him from the same spot through the living room door
racine tries them
they wont budge
racine moves to his right past the front door to the windows off the dining room
he pushes at them as his eyes lock with matty who watches from the hall
the windows wont move racine spins and picks up the nearest object a wooden rocking chair
he lifts it turns and smashes the big window
glass showers into the dining room
she hasnt moved
converted to pdf by www
racine pushes the broken window out of his way
he comes in like a violent gust of wind
racine crosses the dark living room fast
as he reaches matty she lifts her arms to match his embrace
they come together hard and tight
and kiss again
her hands travel over his body as though shes wanted them there for a long time
they turn once slowly along the wall into the dimness of the central hall
then he rotates her body away from him holding her close
then she is just nodding
racine puts his face deep into her hair closing his eyes as the smell of her washes over him
matty turns in his arms and kisses him hard
racine pulls her close to him and they sink to the floor
close on mattys face a look that might be anguish
she bites her lip in expectation
racine moves over her
she pulls him tightly to her clinging like a drowning woman
racine and matty lie under a sheet on her big bed
her eyes are closed
there are more wind chimes on the second floor of the verandah which is off this room and racine is listening to their tinkling
racine looks over in that direction
the moonlit sheer white curtains on the window roil to a light breeze
racines gaze travels over the luxurious bedroom here too it is in the thirties style
their clothes are haphazardly thrown across a divan and on the floor nearby
a delicate fern sways in the wind
finally he is looking at a lovely writing desk against the far wall
some tissue thin stationery flaps in the breeze kept in place by the weight of a pen
then as he looks the paper stops flapping and the chimes gradually stop tinkling
racine looks toward the window
it is still open but the air had died
converted to pdf by www
the curtains hang still
the world has stopped
softly i didnt want this to happen
but i didnt try hard enough to stop it
because i wanted you
i wanted you here like this
this is bad for me
i know it
now nothings going to be the same anymore
from above them we see them framed by the bed
near the front gate of the walker place a heavyset middle aged woman betty the walkers housekeeper has been waiting on a bus stop bench
now she lifts her tired body to board a public bus
down the street just around a corner racine watches her go
he puts the stingray in gear and drives to the walkers
lights are going on across the waterway sending shimmers toward the boat house
were looking out a dusty window at the waterway
we hear racine and matty disentangle and roll apart o
racine grunting his exhaustion
after a moment racine rises up into frame looking happy
he looks down to where he was and rests against the wall
i like this place
its got a nice feel
you were on top
so it could use a better mattress
see to it will you
racine turns and stares out at the ocean
matty rises up behind and hugs him from the back
she kisses his shoulder blades and presses her cheek against his spine
converted to pdf by www
reacting hey gimme a break here
it takes a little while
ignoring him laughs its your fault
smiling it takes me a good thirty seconds
are you sure
i just want to make sure here
she pulls him down
on the lounge cushions that are spread across the floor matty rolls on top of racine
racine reacts with exaggerated pain to the roughness of the cushions
jesus i think youre right he rolls over her you better be on the bottom
no you misunderstood she rolls over him this is my new saddle and i just want to wow
no i must object laughing they roll again and were on racines face as we racines face he is still rolling but he is alone
he has just rolled off the bed
he lies there like a dead man
finally breathless enough
racine is at the sink having just washed his tired face
he opens the medicine cabinet and looks at all the converted to pdf by www
toiletries of mattys husband
he selects a cologne is impressed by its expensive look and slaps a little on his jaw
he doesnt like the smell
he closes the cabinet and moves back into the bedroom
matty wrapped in a thin white terrycloth robe is stripping the bed of its sheets
racine watches from across the room
what are you doing
ive got to wash these
youre afraid of your maid
my mother told me knowledge is power
this is an interesting interpretation
is that why youve started smoking my brand
matty straightens with an armload of sheets
no one must know
promise me ned
he promise with a gesture
racine comes in beat
he throws his jacket across a chair
out the windows to the porch the sun is rising out of the atlantic
racine goes there and closes the curtains
in the gloom he walks to his bed and sits on the edge kicking off his shoes
he picks up his alarm clock and begins setting it
racine has just parked his car and is walking back across the lawn
matty is standing in the gazebo her back turned looking out at the waterway
she is dressed in white and from here she looks very much as she did when they first met
there are wind chimes hanging from the gazebo
hey lady wanna make love
converted to pdf by www
the lady in question turns around surprised
it is not matty at all
it is mary ann
shes attractive but a little cheap looking
she looks him over
i dont know
maybe this sure is a friendly town
racine is nonplussed
he doesnt know what to do
mock hurt feelings you are
you mean the offers no good
racine comes up on the porch
i feel like a jerk
mary ann gives him a salacious smile
maybe you were supposed to deliver it next door
a beat you must be looking for the lady of the house
unbeknownst to either of them matty has been watching from the lawn
now she moves up into the gazebo
in her right hand she has an envelope well filled and sealed
a block away from the station the patrol car races toward an intersection
suddenly a woman steps into the street pushing a baby buggy
pat slams on the brakes and the car skids sideways toward the intersection where it rocks onto two wheels and stops just a few yards short of the buggy
sam sticks his head out the window
are you crazy lady
didnt you hear the siren
the woman dives to the ground as the baby sits up in the buggy he is a midget with a cigar in his mouth and a tommy gun in his
pat jerks sam to the floor just as the midget opens fire
the midget riddles the car with bullets
headlights explode windows are smashed the grill is torn to shreds and steam mushrooms into the air
converted to pdf by www
all four tires are flattened a bumper is sheared off and still the blasting goes on
theres almost nothing left of the patrol car as a dark sedan wheels into the intersection to pick up the woman and the midget
the sedan speeds away and pat and sam climb out of the rubble unhurt but very shaken
siren off tracy cuts the motor and silently glides into cullen park stopping just under a low hanging weeping willow
approaching the boathouse carefully tracy takes out his pistol
the front door is ajar
tracy pushes it and it creaks open
he enters cautiously
the boathouse is dark lit only by moonlight and park lights that shine through the windows
tensely tracy listens for sounds then moves very carefully past stacked up rowboats and canoes
traced against a window at the far end of the boathouse tracy sees the silhouette of a man
gripping his pistol he moves silently toward that silhouette closing in on it while keeping alert for movement
ned this is mary ann
matty hands the envelope to mary ann who puts it in her purse
smiling we were just meeting
ned made me feel very welcome
im an idiot
nice to meet you
are you staying in town
no no just passing through
a little hot for my tastes
were famous for our cool breezes
converted to pdf by www
there is a pregnant pause as mary ann looks him over fighting some private amusement
to mary ann do you want to stay for dinner
negative got to go got to go
she pecks matty on the cheek then steps close to racine to shake his hand
you two have fun now
shes smiling as she leaves the gazebo and walks across the lawn
matty takes racines arm as they watch mary ann get into her little sports car which has been pulled up close to the house
she pulls out waving
i didnt see her car
i got to be more careful
matty turns to him and puts her arms around his neck
mary anns an old friend
shes like a sister to me
she wants me to be happy
mattys mercedes has been pulled out onto lawn next to the lagoons which border the grass
racine and matty can be seen intermittently rising into view in the back seat grappling then disappearing again
matty is giggling
not in a jovial mood you know this has never been one of my pleasures
i considered the time i spent making it grunts sits up like this
penance for some sin
i never knew
maybe worshipping women instead of god
but it never did anything for me
converted to pdf by www
not even a mercedes
racine shakes his head with genuine calf skin upholstery
matty rises up wraps her arms around his neck and kisses him deeply
she pulls him out of sight
an ashtray full to overflowing on the rug next to mattys bed
and above it mattys hand clutching the sheets on the side of the bed
racine and matty lie together in the full bathtub
on the floor beside the tub is the container that catches the ice from a refrigerators automatic icemaker
youre killing me
is there any more ice
im burning up
racine gropes for the ice container and dumps the remaining ice cubs into the tub with them
matty snatches one out of the water and holds it to her forehead
hes coming up tomorrow
i cant stand the thought of him
hes small and mean
racine watches some water run through his fingers

the middle of the night
a light fog has rolled in
racine is walking slowly through the shadows of the heavy foliage
he stops beside a rubber tree
the walker house
in front sits a huge white cadillac
all the lights in the house are out
the wind chimes tinkle softly
racine lights a cigarette
racine stands at the window staring down at the busy main street
he is far away
racine has just entered
matty is calling from somewhere out of sight
just do what i say
go into the living room
its been three days
i want to see you im going to make it up to you tonight
but you must behave
racine goes into the living room and sits down on the couch
matty comes in carrying a tray with two drinks on it
and she is dressed in the uniform of an airline stewardess complete all the way to her little cap
she cannot keep a straight face despite her efforts
racine begins to laugh
converted to pdf by www
choking back her giggles good evening sir
she hands him a drink but he takes it and the tray and puts them on the floor
he pulls her down across his lap
they are both laughing hard
he kisses her
what do you take me for
dont you like it
you think im a kid
you dont like it
i thought you went for this stuff
he pushes her back across the sofa
i want to tell you about the thing
the thing that will drop from the ceiling
in case the cabin suddenly depressurizes oho
a dozen golfers are practicing spotted along the row of hitting pads under floodlights
most are drenched with sweat from their exertion in the muggy air
their randomly timed swings send streaking white bullets into the darkness
but what is hypnotic what so captures a hot night in sound is the irregular cracking of clubs meeting balls crack crack crack crack crack crack
in the darkness of the overlooking parking lot behind a high fence sits the stingray with racine in the drivers seat and matty close beside him
they sit in silence
finally what are we doing here
i love that sound
matty listens but her eyes are on racine
converted to pdf by www
i want to be in bed
is that all you ever think about
racine watches the golfers listening intently
then he sees that matty is crying
he comforts her
matty looks straight ahead and her tone is somber
thats all i ever think about you and me
your body near mine close
im not right when youre not with me
i get the shakes
and each time when i first see you i shake even more
for a while
and then i get calm
i feel safe
ive never been this way
i cant remember how i lived before
he knows its true
its the same for him
he wipes her cheeks with his hand

waterway boat house the water laps against the pier
the quiet sound almost overpowered by the insistent buzz of the night insects
the camera moves toward the house
lagoon gazebo a giant palmetto bug leaps from a lily pad into the water creating a tiny ripple
the camera moves toward the house
stairwell hallway quiet and dark
the camera moves along the shiny white posts of the stairs
racine and matty are in bed
matty is sound asleep her back close to racine
but he is not asleep
he is propped up looking down at her
weve never seen his face like this before
never this open never so much in repose
she stirs and then is still again
he touches her hair lightly

racine dismisses this with a gesture
youve never been shy about that stuff
at this moment detective oscar grace a big powerful black man comes in
hes a plainclothes cop in shirt sleeves his jacket in his hand
as he passes racine on his way to the third seat at the table he squeezes racines shoulders with his huge hands by way of greeting

no army personnel around

lowenstein spots someone speaks to racine in a loud excited whisper

the undulating dunes stretch off as far as we can see
racines stingray is parked on the dirt access road
below it racine and matty sit close in the warm sand
dont say it if you dont mean it
please ned dont

she looks at him a long time
there is real joy in her face
and tears in her eyes

racine puts an arm around her
she looks out at the lighthouse

she pulls away its time for your present
she jumps up and runs back to the car
racine walks back there as matty takes a wrapped package out of the car
she hands it to racine who leans against the car to unwrap it
from now on when it starts coming down on you ill be there to protect you
racine opens the box and smiles broadly
it is a hat a fedora in the classic style
put it on
ill bet i guessed the size right
racine puts on the fedora
he looks simultaneously old fashioned a visitor from the forties and also very chic a present day fashion plate
but most of all he looks exactly right
matty squeals in glee at the sight
i love it
i want to see
racine tries to see his reflection in the cars side view mirror but he has trouble
matty very animated in her delight steps up and kisses him quickly
look in my eyes
can you see yourself
racine tries for a moment then gives up with a laugh
matty opens the door of the stingray and sits in the passenger seat with her legs out
she rolls up the window in that door as racine stands before it
the glass capture the moonlight to make a perfect mirror
as the window goes up racines reflection appears on the glass posing in his hat
at the same time mattys face disappears from view

she turns back to her desk unconvinced
busy weekend crowd
racine sits drinking alone at the bar
he signals for another
racine drives slowly by head craning to peer into the darkness
we begin to hear the thumping again racine has been running
walking now breathing hard he takes his cigarettes from his shorts
at the end of the pier he folds his body over the rail so that it looks as though he will topple over the edge
but he does not he lights up and looks down there
the water following against the thick pilings
then tilting up up and over past the oceans horizon to the perfect blue sky which fills the screen
racine is looking straight up blowing his own clouds

filtered come to me
did you tell him
filtered after a pause no
racines face relaxes
he looks relieved

the wind chimes tinkle softly
light seeps out from mattys bedroom windows half revealing racine and matty lying together on a lounge

maybe ive heard of them
they own that old place in miranda beach the breakers

lets not think about all hes got
converted to pdf by www
pressing what is it matty
tell me exactly what frightens you
because when i think about it i wish that hed die

racine looks off into the night for a few beats then he lifts her face so he can look into her eyes
thats where were at isnt it matty
what do you mean
thats what were both thinking how good itd be for us if he were gone
itd be real sweet for us
dont talk about it ned
talk is dangerous
sometimes it makes things happen it makes it real
dont let it scare you
because hes not gonna die
theres nothing wrong with him is there
theres no reason to think hes gonna die is there
matty shakes her head no lays it in his chest again
so we might as well forget about it its not gonna just happen to make things nice for us
it wont just happen
racine lifts her head and kisses her on the mouth
im afraid ned

again racine is getting no answer
he gives up goes back to his seat at the bar
racine sportcoat slung over his shoulder listens to repeated ringing at the other end of his call
hes surprised theres no answer
people drag by making their way home from work in the heat
finally racine hangs up
racine comes out of the phone booth
he has nowhere to go
he ambles down the street
a few people say hello
he walks diagonally across the street toward a restaurant called tulios
the best restaurant in miranda beach
racine slips on his jacket as he comes in the door
he waves to the hostess across the dining room indicating hell be alone tonight
she signals a short wait
he steps toward the bar bringing him suddenly face to face with matty
hello to you the panic which shoots across her face cuts him off in mid sentence a split second before edmund walker appears behind her
mattys face goes calm and she smiles politely
to racine hello
she turns to her husband
he is not what racine expected
he may in fact be mean as matty described him but he looks neither small nor weak
a handsome man he is bigger than racine and in terrific shape
dressed in an expensive summer suit he radiates vigor and controlled physical power
he wears sleek metal framed glasses
darling id like you to meet mr
i dont know your first name
he offers his hand and walker encloses it firmly in his
converted to pdf by www
nice to meet you
racine is the lawyer i told you about
walker doesnt remember you remember
he had a client who wanted to buy the house
i told him we werent selling
that hasnt changed has it
no were very happy with it
nods i can understand that
its a terrific place
walker nods looking at racine carefully
he motions toward the dining room
are you going in
i was just going to grab a bite
thanks very much but i dont want to interfere with the hostess has come toward them
dont be silly
to hostess we have room for three dont we
the hostess nods and leads the way
walker gestures matty ahead then puts a big hand behind racines elbow and ushers him into the dining room
ive heard this place is great
but you cant get near it on the weekends and i dont get down during the week much
converted to pdf by www
is that right
they have finished their salad at a table toward the back
a waiter comes and takes away their dishes
walker has taken off his glasses and is cleaning the lenses with a lovely handkerchief
he does this cleaning with enormous care and inordinate relish
his manner is a mix of gruff charm and hinted menace
theres something dangerous about the man and its perfectly distilled in his smile which is quick frequent and vaguely threatening
i was a lawyer
still am i guess
but i dont practice
went to columbia
nods good school
i got bored with it quick
i guess i didnt have the temperament
i wanted to make the money faster
is there a living in it here
i can afford to send my shirts out
and eat here once a month if i dont order an appetizer
walker smiles re folds his handkerchief carefully and puts it back in the cheat pocket of his jacket
i figured an honest lawyer doesnt make much and the other kind was too slimy for me
id rather be upfront about shafting somebody
thats all right
i dont like it much
whats to like
thats the way of the world
most people despise their jobs
converted to pdf by www
walker picks up a wine bottle and pours more into each of their glasses emptying it
i love it
but its not a job
what is it exactly
walker signals to a distant waiter for another bottle of wine
he does it with a small flick of his finger
this and that
here and there
you dont have to be specific
that smile again finance basically
venture capital investments real estate
were into a few things
we own some things here
edmunds company owns the breakers

for a second walkers eyes flick over matty like a whip
its not that simple
we have an interest in a few places along the shore
for the land
theres no explaining it to her
to racine im too dumb
woman you know
she picks up her purse and stands up with a good humored smile
the men rise
ill be right back
converted to pdf by www
then maybe we can talk about pantyhose or something interesting
she walks away
walker watches her go with a satisfied possessive grin
shes something isnt she
nods a lovely lady
yes she is
im crazy about her
if i ever thought she was seeing another guy
i dont know
he takes a sip of wine id understand how it could happen
her being the way she is
id understand it
but i think id kill the guy with my bare hands
walker looks at racine and laughs
as he begins to speak he focuses intently on racine
he seems to be trying to communicate something other than what hes saying
you wouldnt believe the dorkus she was with when i met her
the guy came to us with a business proposition
were always looking for opportunities
if the conditions are right
were willing to take an occasional risk if the downside isnt too steep
but this guy hadnt done his homework he didnt know the bottom line
thats how i knew he was full of shit
youve got to know the bottom line
thats all that really counts
again walker takes off his glasses
he holds them up to the light and then rubs them again with his handkerchief
he didnt have the goods this guy
he was like a lot of guys you run into they want to get rich they want to do it quick they want to be there with one score
he puts his glasses back on stares at racine
converted to pdf by www
but theyre not willing to do whats necessary
do you know what i mean
racine looks at him in silence for a moment
im not sure
you mean lay the groundwork
i mean do whats necessary
the two men stare at each other a few beats
i know that kind of guy
i cant stand that
it makes me sick
im not like that
walker roars with laughter
a huge powerful burst that shakes the table
and racine laughs with him
mattys bedroom window from a distance
the light goes out racine is watching from the shadows of the gazebo
he stares up there
the tinkling of the wind chimes rises and rises
it crests and begins to fade replaced by the racine runs south along the beach
the whooshing slows
he is looking at something
he takes out his cigarettes as he slows to a walk
when he is directly across from what hes staring at he sits in the sand he lights up

matty kisses him on the mouth then shakes her head no

in his own thoughts we could account for a couple calls
weve had some contact
that would make sense
matty grasps his face in her hands and looks into his face
because were going to kill him
we both know that
mattys face looks different than weve seen it
theres a fire burning behind there and the heat its throwing is bringing her equal portions of dread and relief
she stares at him thats what you want isnt it
we knew it was coming
its the only way we can get everything we want isnt it
mattys nod is barely perceptible
the mans gonna die for no reason but we want him dead

he doesnt deserve it
lets not ever say that
were doing it for us
and youre going to inherit half of everything he owns
thats what the will says right
again the tiny nod
he pulls her head close so he doesnt have to look into her eyes anymore
thats it then
were gonna kill him
and i think i know how
matty reacts to this
its real then
yeah its real all right and if were not careful its gonna be the last real thing we do
matty sits at the wheel of her mercedes at the curb
she smokes her cigarette nervously
racine walks over to the car from the docks and leans down to the window
i know where he is
its not far from here
i dont want you with me
i thought we settled that
ill wait in the car but she puts a hand on him i want to take the risks with you

whatsa matter you cant think with a little music
demonstrating like this i said
racine nods then duplicates the clipping
teddy goes back to his stool slapping the beat of the music on his thigh
racine pulls out the alarm lever on the clock attached to the device and stands up
he throws a look to teddy and teddy nods that yes the device is now set
nods to the music its fast
you can use the clock or rig it to something that moves
it starts big and itll go with just the mag clips

racine remembers telling teddy that
listen man maybe you should let me do it for you

that roz is a smart one
and you know that anything heather inherits goes straight to roz

if i could swing it couldnt we rewrite it
then when he dies i could find the new one
we could just change it a little
every little change would mean a lot to us end

a teenage hotrodder passes him and he is alone again
as he turns off the road he checks his watch
he drives through a neighborhood of neat houses
he turns onto a four line interstate

we move in on it and mattys face her head on a pillow turned away from her husband away from the bedroom door
her look is just as intense as racines
her eyes are focused on an alarm clock on the nightstand
there is the sound of a car somewhere outside and matty reacts to it silently
she listens with her whole being
the wind chimes tinkle
racines hand takes hold of the doorknob
he tries it
it wont open

he gives an irritated glance upward
then he moves along the wall
the alarm clock
she tries to confirm that walker is sleeping without looking there
matty begins to move her legs slowly toward the side of the bed to get out
suddenly the bed lurches
matty gasps and whips her head around to look
edmund is standing next to his side of the bed in his undershorts
he puts on his glasses and looks at her
jesus take it easy
i thought i was tense
what are you doing
i cant sleep
im going down and get something to drink
matty watches with panicky eyes as edmund moves toward door
when she speaks her voice is different husky
he turns to look at her
she moves once on the bed languidly
i cant sleep either
he peers at her in the darkness
lock the door darling
edmund studies her then walks over and locks the door
edmunds alarm clock
edmund rolls into view his breath ragged
mattys hand is on his chest
edmund looks at her and laughs
you trying to kill me

matty flat on her back smiles weakly and looks at the ceiling
again the mattress moves
she looks at edmund
he has pulled on his shorts and is walking toward the bathroom
im going downstairs
do you want anything
he disappears into the bathroom
matty slips out of bed
she is wearing a silky nightgown
she hurries to the bedroom door
calling softly to him ill go down with you
she opens the door and steps into the hall
matty looks across the hall toward the open door to the guest room it is dark
she hurries to the stairs peering down into the darkness
she starts down the steps
mattys pov as she comes down the steps
each shadow doorway and alcove threatens to erupt with life
matty reaches the bottom of the stairs and peers around
she starts back along the dark hall of the house just as edmund comes out of the bedroom upstairs he is still in his undershorts
he reaches the top of the stairs as matty moves back along the hall
the alcove under the stairs is in black shadow
matty is focused on it
just as she reaches it the lights in the hall snap on
racine is standing under the stairs poised to strike the figure in the hall with a heavy wooden plank about two feet long
matty gasps at the sight but it is covered by at the top of the stairs christ woman did you ever hear of turning on the lights
racine doesnt breathe
matty is frozen in the spot directly in front of racine and five feet below edmund who now starts down the steps
converted to pdf by www
stops what is it
whispering up at him put on a robe or something
what if heather wakes up and comes down
edmund frowns goes back up the stairs
shes not going to wake up at oclock in the morning
racine and matty lock eyes
racine slips back through the alcove door
matty watches heather give edmund a big goodbye kiss and run off to talk to betty the walkers housekeeper who is sweeping the front terrace
edmund gets in the cadillac
matty leans down and kisses him goodbye
you dont really mind do you
matty shakes her head roz will pick her up on friday
and dont worry roz wont stay overnight
she can do whatever she wants
gives her a skeptical look listen i dont know if ill be able to come up next weekend
ill know more later
ill call you
he gives her a once over proprietary look and drives away honking once to heather who waves
matty sits on the dock dangling her feet in the water as heather plays in an inner tube
racine stands at his office window staring down at the traffic on main street
he wipes the sweat from his brow with his finger
at night matty comes upstairs with a highball in her hand
she pauses and looks across the hall to the half open door of the guest room
there is just blackness there no way to know if heather is asleep or watching
converted to pdf by www
matty goes out the hall door to the verandah and sits down with her drink
the wind chimes tinkle
at night racine runs sweating along the boardwalk footsteps thumping
matty is in a phone booth in a gas station speaking urgently
she hangs up
in his office racine hangs up disgruntled
his feet up on his desk he has been toying with the fedora matty gave him
now he sails it across the office at the hook of a coatstand
it hits and bounces off onto the floor
racine gets up walks over and picks it up
he walks away from the coatstand then turns and floats the hat through the air to land on the hook
from his new position he can see out into the reception area
beverly is working at her desk
racine watches her small movements
beverly looks up and sees him
heather is happily watching television in the enclosed side verandah in the walker house
matty is in a big chair
she watches heather not the television
she puts a cigarette in her mouth then reaches out to strike a wooden match against the rough surface of the porcelain match holder
as it bursts into flame it becomes h
the flame at the end of racines match
he is drinking alone at a bar and now lights another cigarette
matty comes out
shes wearing a light simple shift
she walks over to a small table and begins putting some dirty dishes and glasses on a small tray
suddenly racine takes her into his arms from behind
she gasps in terror he turns her to him
he is wearing only cut off blue jean shorts and his body is wet glistening
his hair is soaking slicked straight back
he looks different
she sees who it is and kisses him deeply
they whisper my god you scared me
you shouldnt be here
heathers still here
i miss you so badly
but its too dangerous
she wont wake up now
youre all wet
converted to pdf by www
ive been out there waiting for two hours
sleepy aunt matty
the door from the house squeaks open and heather puts one foot onto the porch she looks only half awake as she peers into the gloom
racine has turned at the sound and for one moment he is sideways to her his head turned in her direction
heathers eyes suddenly discern the scene
racine turns away at the same instant that heather stumbles backwards through the door and out of sight
heathers footsteps patter swiftly away
matty and racine look at each other
matty comes up the stairs and looks toward the guest room
the door is closed
matty sits with coffee and toast at the table
the walkers housekeeper moves about in the kitchen
heather comes in and takes her place opposite matty
she seems perfectly normal
but she doesnt look matty in the eye
good morning aunt matty
to the housekeeper hi betty
matty watches over her coffee as heather butters a muffin
is there any more of that strawberry stuff
roz kraft edmund walkers sister closes the passenger door of her station wagon behind heather
matty stands nearby
what do you say
converted to pdf by www
roz gives heather a look
thank you aunt matty
roz walks around the car and gets in
we appreciate it
any time roz
shes a pleasure
roz smiles waves and pulls away
matty watches them go worried
the lights are out
theres enough moonlight pouring in the open windows to see racine sitting on the bed in his shorts his back propped against some pillows at the headboard
a fan whirs on a table
he lights another cigarette and takes another drink a bottle of bourbon sits on his nightstand
from where he sits he can see the ocean
there is a knock at the door
it is me
matty comes in
she peers into the darkness until she sees him
she locks the door and turns to face him
she is dressed in a pale silk suit and blouse very carefully put together
she looks as good as she ever has she seems to create her own light
why havent you answered your phone
you took a chance coming here
hes not coming up this weekend
why havent you answered
i didnt want to talk
i just wanted to think
converted to pdf by www
nods then after a moment can i get in with you
racine just stares at her
i dont know what heather will tell roz
maybe shell be embarrassed or afraid
maybe shell think she imagined the whole thing
chuckles without humor maybe we all did
well know if she does tell
roz will report to edmund quick enough
its exactly what shes always wanted
matty disappears for a moment into the shadows
ive been thinking too
and what have you got
matty emerges from the darkness and sits on the edge of the bed next to racine
she looks into his eyes
i think we should give it up
we havent done anything criminal yet
racine has been thinking along the same lines
he stubs out his cigarette
its not too late to back out
i dont think we can do it
what do you mean
things have already started to go wrong
i feel like we got to the edge and looked over and well it was too much
well just have to live with that
converted to pdf by www
she sits down on the bed
ill divorce him
and we wont have his money
part of me wants it so bad
id be lying if i said i didnt
but its the worst part of me the weakest part
she leans back against him
all that matters is that were together
after a moment you dont think i can pull it off
its not you its us
im sure ill make some mistake
thats not what you really mean is it matty
yes it is
very calm flat no it isnt
you think hes too much for me
you think ill fuck it up get us caught
matty turns toward him
dont talk that way
its not true
racine studies her face
well thats what ive been thinking
dont think that ever
i know you could do it
moving closer but all i care about is you
the money doesnt matter
it does in this world the one were living in

matty presses her head against his chest
why torture ourselves about it
racine laughs he doesnt know whats funny
whens he coming back
thatll be it then
nothing will stop us
is that what you really want
are you sure
i wasnt before but i am now
racine reaches over her gets another cigarette and lights it
after he takes a deep drag she takes it from him and takes a puff too
this time youre going to know how to reach me
i dont want any more surprises
racine locks up a rented ford on a side street and walks back two cars to where his stingray is parked
as he bends to unlock the stingray he looks around and a passing car catches his attention
racines pov panning with the car as it drives by him
there is only one thing extraordinary about this particular car
the driver hunched and intent on the road ahead is a clown in full costume and makeup
racine watches as the car disappears
for a moment racine looks like a dead man
matty is reclining in the soapy water slowly scrubbing
she hums to herself
converted to pdf by www
a parking attendant takes racines stingray as racine goes into the lobby
matty is leaning against one of the posts that flank the porch stairs
headlights pass across the front of the house and mattys body
she smiles a welcoming smile to the unseen edmund
a light fog is settling into the dips of the road
now racines rented ford appears out of one such depression and moves into a clear stretch
racine eyes the fog with concern
the fog is much heavier here
it rolls in past the house in thick waves
the only light burning is on the front porch
the wind chimes tinkle softly
the wind chimes tinkle nudged by the same breeze that floats the fog around them
the alarm clock
again matty lies on her side turned away from edmund eyes wide watching the clock
again the bed moves suddenly
matty rolls over to look
edmund is sitting up in bed putting on his glasses
edmund motions for her to be silent
whispering i think theres someone downstairs i heard something
he swings out of bed he is in his undershorts
are you sure
converted to pdf by www
again he silences her
he walks silently over to his
closet and disappears inside
whispering should i call the police
low from the closet will you be quiet
im going to nail the bastard
edmund comes out of the closet checking the safety on a shiny nickel plated
aghast edmund whats that
will you be quiet
ive never seen that
at the bedroom door ive got a surprise for this fucker
edmund be careful
but he is already out the door silently
for a moment matty is frozen then she slides out of bed
edmund has stopped at the top of the stairs
he listens for sounds from below
he starts down the steps in the dark
edmund comes slowly down the steps his gun pointing here then there in his perfectly steady grip
the thrill of the hunt is in edmunds eyes
the downstairs is thick with ominous shadows
at the bottom of the steps he stops and listens again
he moves in two quick steps to the entry hall and looks into the living room and dining room
he seems to hear something at the rear of the house
he turns and moves back along the central hall very slowly
the alcove under the stairs is pitch black
edmund points his gun at that approaching space and stops
the tinkling of the wind chimes rises weirdly making it hard for him to hear
converted to pdf by www
edmunds hand reaches out to the wall
his fingers find the light switch
he flips it
for a second we are blinded by the glare
in the next instant as we see that the space below the stairs is empty matty screams from the top of the stairs he has a gun
edmund thinks she is warning him
he spins to look
suddenly racine bursts from the hall closet the wooden plank raised above his head
he brings it down fast toward edmunds head
edmund reacts instinctively raising his arm the arm that holds the gun to protect himself
the wooden plank smashes down half its force taken by edmunds forearm half by his head
the gun blasts once
one small window in the front door shatters and the bullet continues into the night
edmunds revolver slides across the hall floor into a corner
edmund is on the floor blood pouring from his scalp
but he is coming on like a crazed beast
his glasses askew but still on his head he has grasped racine around the legs
with a powerful lunge he pulls racines legs out
racine crashes to the hall floor losing the wooden plank
matty frozen at the stair railing cries out
edmund is pulling racine toward him with all his might crawling up racines body as they both slide on the wood floor
edmund reaches out one huge hand and pulls racine even closer
racine puts his left hand into edmunds face his thumb flat against the lens of edmunds glasses and pushes his head back
the glasses fly away and racine loses his hold
edmund comes on
racines right hand gropes gropes finds the wooden plank
he swings it up
the wooden plank describes a perfect arc into our view and then out finding its mark with a horrible thud
matty up the stairs turns away
racine falls back on the floor
converted to pdf by www
the trunk is open like a giant maw
a sheet of plastic has been spread across the inside
edmunds body flops down inside
he has been dressed his shoes and watch put on
racine drops the blooded wooden plank beside the body then throws a blanket over the corpse and slams the trunk
racine turns to matty who stands fully dressed shaking in the foggy air
the cars at the end of the drive
spend the fifteen minutes cleaning up inside then come
youre gonna have to be careful in this fog
he looks at her are you all right
racine gets in the cadillac and pulls away
the first stretch of racines route to the breakers looks different in the dense fog
racine has to take it slowly
he consults his watch
a branch from one of the overhanging trees looms up abruptly in the windshield like a grasping arm
racine drives through the silent neighborhood
the houses are invisible in the fog their presence indicated only by an occasional glowing light
suddenly a police siren pierces the night followed by the appearance of a flashing red light on the street behind the cadillac
racines eyes jump to the rear view mirror and the flashing red light growing in it
racine pulls over
the police car slows as it reaches the cadillac pulls alongside and then speeds on ahead siren squealing
a light goes on in the house in front of which racine has stopped
he pulls away
the cadillac pulls up to the interstate from the side street
converted to pdf by www
as on the other night there is more traffic here
but it is moving slowly in the fog
racine has to cross two lanes of traffic to go south
he peers out through the misted windshield
he starts to pull out and a sports car appears from nowhere doing fifty sitting on his horn
racine hits the brakes
as soon as it has passed there is a lull
racine fishtails across the road just ahead of a truck and moves south
the traffic on racines side of the interstate has slowed
theres an accident up ahead
the police car that passed racine is on the scene but the lone cop is not enough
some passing motorists have pulled over to help with the wreck and direct traffic
the fog is aglow with flashing red and white lights and burning flares
a man signals for racine to stop
the cars in the opposite lanes are allowed to pass through
racine keeps his head down
a stocky trucker comes out of the glowing fog and walks up to the cadillac
he leans down into the drivers window
hey man do you have any flares
i dont think so
irritated could you check your trunk
we got kinda of a mess here
i dont have them
i told you
the stocky trucker gives him a disgusted look and stands up
dont put yourself out
the man in the road ahead signals for racine to pull around into the opposite lanes and move on
tracking along beside the cadillac racine moves slowly through the nightmare scene
figures move by carrying lights and tools
the injured cry out in pain
three cars are meshed in crumpled steel
a clutch of onlookers are outlined against the beams of headlights
racine might as well be driving into hell
converted to pdf by www
here is relief
the cadillac moves all alone across the bridge
the lights penetrate the fog at orderly intervals barely illuminating the bridge
a huge fog horn fills the air from not far way
the deserted hotel looms ghostly in the fog
the cadillac lights out rolls silently to a stop in the half hidden delivery driveway
racine carrying only a flashlight has made his way to the supply area he visited before
his beam probes dark corners responds to random creaking
satisfied that he is alone he moves a wooden crate and reaches into the hole in the wall which it hid
he brings out teddys incendiary device and places it on the floor in the middle of the room
racine grunts under the weight of edmunds corpse flung over his back
he stumbles back toward the hulking hotel
the trunk of the cadillac is closed
racine sits down hard
he is streaming with sweat under the enormous dead weight
he adjusts the plastic sheet so that edmunds bloody skull wont contact the wall
racine gathers his strength and half lifts half drags the body down the corridor his silhouette that of a twisted double headed monster
his flashlight glows from ahead at his destination
in the supply area racine has dropped edmunds body over some tipped shelves
now he lifts the heavy ceiling beam he spotted earlier
he has to change its angle only two feet in order to let it drop now on edmunds head
racine walks over to the incendiary device
he pulls out the lever and straightens up
as he does he looks down a connecting hallway
he sees movement
he snatches up the flashlight and the wooden plank and rushes down that hallway
at the end of the hallway racine slides to a halt breathing hard
again he sees the movement
a horrible sweaty figure confronts him there is a broken mirror attached to the wall
racine looks at himself a long moment and the tension seems to drain away
someone speaks in the shadows
converted to pdf by www
racine jumps and spins toward the sound which is only a little more than a moan
his flashlight seeks out the source a ragged bum is stirring in his sleep on a bed of newspapers
he wears an old baseball cap
racine looks at him a long time trying to decide what to do
he looks back in the direction of the supply area
he looks at the bum settling again into a deep sleep
he looks for one final second at himself in the mirror
racine appears at a run from the fog
he has the bum with him grasped firmly at the neck of the collar and the seat of his pants
racine is forcing the bum to run along with him
the bum is mightily confused not least by the fact that racine has jammed the baseball cap all the way down over his nose he can see nothing
racine lets go hurtling him across the sand
a low growl get the hell out of here and dont come back
the bum is sprawled in the sand
the baseball cap has come off
he watches racines dark figure recede in the fog
a whisper come on back here and fight like a man
matty sits fidgeting in the front seat trying to peer through the soupy fog
she sucks on an unlit cigarette
racine appears at the drivers window
he is a horrible sight
he gets in the drivers seat
i thought racine grabs her and pulls her down out of sight bending his body low over her
the windows are suddenly illuminated by the beams of headlights
they grow brighter and a police patrol car red light slowly revolving on the top passes next to the ford and moves off quietly in the fog
converted to pdf by www
whisper theyre right on time and im running late
he rises slowly and watches the patrol car disappear
the ford stops at front of the drive
racine and matty break from a kiss
he moves her away from him
we wont talk for a long time
they look at each other
she gets out
the rented ford speeds through the foggy night
he knows that for the first time in his life hes really done it
theres no turning back
racine does something that hes going to be doing for the rest of his life
he looks in the rear view mirror
everything is as racine left it
edmunds body lies beneath the beam
it is barely discernible in the gloom
the only bright spot in the room is the incendiary device its shiny surface catching some errant sliver of light
and then it explodes with a harsh shriek
and the light of the magnesium chips is white blinding
the chips are out in all directions to the waiting puddles of gasoline
the light goes from white to yellow as huge flames engulf the room
the flames roar
we watch them for a few moments and then matty stands in the fog one arm wrapped around a post of the porch
above her the wind chimes tinkle
she struggles to hear something else
finally she does hear it and her face relaxes and she looks at peace
listening to soft distant sirens

as it does the phone rings
beverly answers out in the reception room her conversation muffled through the slightly cracked door
she hits a hold button and yells as is her informal custom
do you want him
who is he

racine is silent
yes well mrs
walker has submitted the new will you wrote up there
racine closes his eyes for a moment
the blood drains out of his face

and frankly mr
racine i think we may have a problem
what problem is that
well id rather discuss it in person
in fact i think it might be best if we could all get together down there
that is if you wouldnt object
no no that would be all right
we have a relationship with a firm in west palm shiller hastings
i know of them
ive arranged to have the use of their offices
i thought we might try to make it tomorrow say ten oclock
would that be possible for you
yes i think so
walker told me she would be back down there by then

walkers sister to join us also
ill see you then
hardin clicks off

he gets up his mind racing
he goes to the window and parts two of the blinds with his fingers
the sun makes him squint
racine opens the door from his office
to beverly will you get me mrs
edmund walker please
beverly wrinkles her brow spins her rolodex
i dont have her
i thought the temporary put her in
she came in while you were on vacation
look it up
they were in pinehaven i think

seated around the room are matty roz kraft and much to racines surprise his friend peter lowenstein matty is dressed in chic black miles hardin comes around the big desk
to shake racines hand
hardin is an impressive guy in a suit
he greets racine with icy eyes and a cordial look
miles hardin mr
how are you
i dont think you know mrs
shakes her head no
racine comes up to matty and takes her hand
walker im very sorry about your husband
thank you mr
you know mr
they shake and lowenstein gives him a cheerful grin
racine shakes his hand
hardin motions racine into a chair and moves back around the desk
i asked mr
lowenstein to join us because hes handling the inquiry into edmunds death for the county prosecutors office
he and i have discussed this matter and hes made is possible for us to speak very frankly here today
off the record so to speak
converted to pdf by www
to racine as ive told mrs
walker i was more than a little surprised by the existence of this new will
edmund hadnt mentioned anything about it to me
hardin looks at racine a beat but racine has nothing to say
walker explained to me that when she and her husband decided to make some minor changes they just took care of it up here for simplicitys sake
and indeed as you know the new will is almost identical to the old but for the disposition of a few items
to the group in general at the risk of oversimplifying the thrust of the will is to divide the estate in almost equal parts between heather kraft and mrs
would you agree with that assessment mr
and you witnessed the signing by edmund walker along with this miss glancing at papers on the desk mary ann simpson on july twenty first
apparently it will be impossible for us to contact miss simpson
mary ann is a lifelong friend of mine
she happened to be visiting on her way to europe
im sure when she returns shell get in touch with me
eyeing hardin although its certainly not required
the witnesses to the signing of a will are not commonly available when the will is entered into probate
its not standard by any means
hardin glances at lowenstein who watches impassively
converted to pdf by www
edmund walkers death was not standard
to hardin pardon me
is there some question about the authenticity of the will
racine would like to kiss roz instead he turns with a questioning look to hardin
im confused too
do you have a problem with the witnessing or the signatures
what is it youre getting at
almost wistful no there doesnt seem to be any problem here
this is edmund walkers last will and testament
im afraid the problem is elsewhere
he reaches into his coat and brings out a gold cigar case
would anyone mind if i smoked
no one does
in fact racine matty and roz all immediately produce their own packs of cigarettes
the effect is comical and everyone in the room laughs at the group reflex
roz notices that lowenstein is not lighting up and offers him one of hers
i dont need my own
ill just breathe the air
roz smiles and tilts her head to blow a stream of smoke toward the ceiling
we tilt up with it as the white smoke intrudes the clear air and the same space thick with smoke and tilt down to the assembled group all of whom
are focused on hardin except for lowenstein whose glance dances about the rapt faces
everythings in order up to there
the problem comes in the language of the bequest to heather
its a technical matter
converted to pdf by www
in writing the will im afraid mr
racine violated whats known as the rule against perpetuities
hardin watches racine who reacts minutely
its a small thing but its the law
it forbids an inheritance to be passed down indefinitely for generations
many general practitioner lawyers dont fully understand it
it doesnt come up much for them because wills this complex are usually handled by estate departments in larger firms
handled by lawyers who specialize in this type of work
matty turns a confused look to roz who returns it sympathetically
hardin notes it
i know this is terribly confusing but if youll bear with me
i spotted the problem right away but since edmunds intent was clear i thought it in everyones best interest to try and get the will admitted into probate anyway even
though it was technically incorrect
i knew that a probate judge in miami would spot the mistake right away
thats all they do all day theyre expert
so i thought id bring it up here to okeelanta county since edmund had the residence here and see if i could get lucky with a judge who didnt know
estate law quite so well
dryly he cant resist perhaps find one with the same kind of training as mr
racine watches him his mind racing ahead too fast to bother being insulted
lowenstein cant help a small wincing smile
now hardin gets to his payoff and there is no amusement in his tone
unfortunately my plan backfired
i ran into a judge whod had other dealings with mr
a judge costanza
converted to pdf by www
in fact it seems there were problems with an estate in a case four years ago
very different problems its true
but on a will mr
it was quite a mess
accusations of carelessness a malpractice suit
to racine i think he called it the gourson case
racine watches him dully then concentrates on taking out a cigarette
once again mr
hardin youve lost me
yes what does all this mean
it means im afraid that edmunds will is invalid
edmund walker died interstate as though there were no will at all
roz looks at matty with panicky eyes
what happens now
hardin looks her over coldly
he doesnt believe she doesnt know you dont know
irritated no i dont
racine would like to tell you
racine is recovering
he gives hardin a quick ugly look then turns toward matty and speaks quietly
in the state of florida when a person dies without a will and there are no children and no surviving parents then the spouse inherits everything
it seems to take a long moment for matty to fully digest this
it takes not quite as long for roz
converted to pdf by www
her face goes through several transformations confusion to disbelief to despair then on in the direction of outrage
lowensteins eyes are flashing around at the faces
he seems genuinely amused
its all mine
hardin is an unconvinced audience
though that was clearly not your husbands intention
he intended heather to benefit looking between hardin and roz of course of course i understand
as you can imagine mrs
walkers given the circumstances of edmunds death none of this is going to happen
how should i say it
matty seems still in shook
matty racine roz lowenstein and hardin stand talking in a little cluster near the building
they say their good byes with much handshaking
matty lays a reassuring hand on rozs arm and kisses her on the cheek
as she breaks from the crowd racine walks with her
the others stand talking a little longer
racine takes off his jacket in the blazing heat
he is very aware of the little group behind them as he walks with matty to her mercedes
when they are out of earshot you look good in black

ive missed you so badly
i need you
at first i couldnt figure out when you got ahold of my stationery and stuff
it finally came to me
edmunds signature must have been a snap
and you knew i wasnt gonna challenge mine please stop
i dont blame you for hating me right now
youve really done it matty
you really have
behind them the group breaks up hardin goes back into the building and lowenstein walks roz the short distance to her car
matty reaches the door of her car and turns to racine
will you come to the house tonight
she takes his hand and shakes it for show
i want you more right now than i ever have
i know how you must feel about me
but please come tonight
i hope you havent done us in
matty gets into her car
at the far end of the parking lots lowenstein has been watching them as he makes his way to his car
now as he moves between two rows of cars he executes a few nifty dance steps just like fred astaire
racine jacket over his shoulder and briefcase in hand leaves the stingray at the curb and goes into the big house of which his apartment is the top floor
racine trudges up the dark steps in the heat

its behavior like that makes oscars job so hard
would you guys a beer
no thanks i already had one
oscar indicates no as racine takes one from the refrigerator for himself and begins unbuttoning his shirt
ive gotta bring my wife up here
she thinks our house is the hottest place in the county
it aint great this time of day
there is a pregnant pause as racine takes off his shirt and leans against the refrigerator
ned how did you get involved with this matty walker
takes a drink what do you mean
i mean shes poison man
tell me what you know about her old mans death
what read in the paper
he died in the fire
looks like arson converted to pdf by www
okay was arson
you dont know if he was setting it and messed up
or if thats just what someone wanted it to look like
nah he didnt set it
somebody offend him
his people owned the place or something
nods thats right
a very rough group of fellows too
theyre arguing with the insurance company right now
its possible they wanted to cut old edmund out
im sure theyre not too broken up over his departure
grimaces but this just doesnt seem like a neat way to handle something like that
its not their style
theyre very smooth
theyd rather destroy you than kill you
and they hate publicity
racine takes it in sucks on his beer
course guys like that make a lot of enemies
coulda been a grudge match from the outside i suppose
he looks at racine but me im kinda interested in the grieving widow
racine looks a little skeptical
he thinks about it as he moves to a chair
her sister in laws got plenty of ideas along that line too
she could barely contain herself today i could tell
he cackles but she wants to wait and see how matty treats her on the estate
she doesnt want to blow it
converted to pdf by www
howd you get involved
shrugs they asked me to re do the will
i met with her and edmund
it was pretty simple
this mary ann simpson witnessed it with me
walker didnt seem to think it was any big deal
what was this simpsons story
i dont know
old friend of theirs good looking broad
she was just passing through
on her way to europe
racine shrugs he doesnt know
the passport people cant find any record of that
lowenstein and grace look at him a long time
what do you think
about the wife
racine considers a moment
i suppose its possible
i dont know much about her except he grins what ive seen
wouldnt shock me either way
ive got a feeling shes very bad news
take some incredibly intelligent advice and stay away from her
hes right for once
they both get up to leave
racine watches from the chair
converted to pdf by www
well im sorry guys
im afraid i cant do that
first of all did you get a look at her
he stands up and comes right up to them
that wouldnt be quite so meaningful except that today she started coming on to me
and maybe you havent heard but the lady is about to come into a great deal of money
they look at him with some concern
the fact is shes invited me out to her place tonight
and im going
and ill keep on going as many nights or days or weekends as shell have me
ned that lady may have just killed her husband
racine smiles cheerfully and puts a reassuring arm around lowensteins shoulder leading him to the door
peter shes not gonna inherit anything by killing me
lowenstein is out the door now
he looks at racine in wonder
he shakes his head and goes down the steps
racine turns smiling to grace but oscar is grim
ned youve messed up before
youll mess up again
thats your nature
but theyve always been small time
this might not be
shes trouble ned
the real thing
big time major league trouble
racine reassures his friend with touch and oscar leaves
converted to pdf by www
matty closes the front door behind racine and wraps her arms around him
she kisses him hard and long on the mouth then starts on his neck
he begins to push her away but she clings to him eating him up
i know youd probably like to kill me
you can hate me
hurt me if you want but dont talk yet
she takes his hand and drags him to the steps and leads the way up her eyes on him always
he lets her lead him up the stairs
they lie in bed
the wind chimes tinkle outside
mary ann and i left wheaton together and went to chicago
we didnt know what we were doing
i got in bad trouble with drugs
i did things
she looks up at him whatevers the evilest thing you can think of me now i did worse things then
theres nothing lower than the animal i was then
worse than you can imagine
i thought i would die
i prayed i would
and then a man helped me
he got me clean
he didnt want much in return either
he was a lawyer and he put me to work in his office
i learned a lot there
one time i even thought i might go to law school
thats where i picked up the business about making a will invalid
that happened to him once
i swear i would never have used that if id known about your case
i was afraid to tell you ned
i knew you wouldnt let me do it
im greedy like you said
i wanted us to have it all
she moves up over him and looks into his face
converted to pdf by www
i dont blame you for thinking im bad
i know it
id understand if you just cut me off now
if you never trusted me again
youd probably be smart
but you must believe one thing
i love you
i love you and need you
i want to be with you forever
she puts her head on his chest as racine lights a cigarette
they already think youre involved
i dont care
theres nothing we can do about it now
in a little while well either have the money or we wont
its out of our hands
racine thinks about this awhile
he exhales a stream of smoke
i fired the housekeeper
we can stay together as long as we want
were all alone here now
lowenstein makes heather and roz comfortable in the waiting room then goes through the gate partition nods at the cop clerk on duty and goes into oscar graces office re
closing the door behind him
its cramped hot cluttered
there is one other door out of the office
grace has his feet up on his desk
hes nursing a bottle of coke and looking at racine who stands across the office leaning on a file cabinet and glaring between sentences
racine gives lowenstein an ugly look then returns his attention to grace
racine is angry but in control
converted to pdf by www
ive been down there a lot lately
isnt that amazing
im handling the purchase of some property down there
ill be going back in the future
if thats all right if its still legal to go to miami
there is silence
lowenstein looks between them speaks to grace
he is mad
no im not mad
why should i be mad just because my friend here who ive know for years wants to know of my whereabouts on the night of our recent local murder
its not so recent anymore
maybe hes feeling some pressure
grace is pained by all this but his tone is scolding defensive
you brought this on yourself man
i dont run this department you know
there are people watching this thing
they hear youre out there banging the widow every night it tends to call attention to you
so dont give me shit
lowenstein goes to oscars desk and takes a pull from the bottle of coke
thats my business
this whole damn case is getting crazy
to grace did you tell him about the glasses
grace exasperated indicates that he didnt
seems walker always ware glasses steel rimmed glasses
he was a real fanatic about them
converted to pdf by www
racine is still staring at grace
he barely seems to pay attention
but there were none on the scene
coroner says they shouldve been there
he says that even after the fire the frames shouldve been seared into his well you dont want to hear the details
so its looking more and more like he was killed somewhere else and brought there in his own car
your honey his wife says he left the house in the middle of the night driving himself to some mysterious meeting
is that vague enough for you
look what is this
what do you want
am i supposed to be an undercover agent for you guys or something
interesting choice of phrase
how bout tonight i ask her
say did you kill your husband
my friends were just wondering
hey thats an idea
ask her where the glasses are where she did it
anything else im forgetting oscar
just one thing
lowenstein looks at him a long moment
racine watches them
youll love this ned this latest development
maybe youll be able to work up a little sympathy for us see why oscar here has a tendency to get carried away
tell him oscar
this is rich

this is from the sister in law the kraft woman
shes been driving me batty lately
shes convinced she aint gonna be out into the will
it seems that a couple weeks before the murder walkers niece stayed up there for a while with your friend matty
one night she waxes up goes to see her aunt and catches the lady with some guy
the three men look at each other
lowenstein breaks into laughter
do you get it
in the act or some fucking thing
we havent got all the details yet
kraft is bringing the little girl up here today to tell us her story
to grace oh theyre here
i ran into them on the way in
theyre waiting outside
im not sure im up to dealing with this scene
there is a long pause
the other two look at racine
to racine listen you probably dont want to see the kraft woman right now
shes a little wild
why dont you slip out the back way here
racine looks first at lowenstein then at grace
are we done here
nods looking at his notes ive got it all here
and ned im sorry i had to ask
racine is neutral
he indicates the front entrance
converted to pdf by www
ill go out this way
ive had a lot of experience with disgruntled people
to lowenstein ill be over to stellas if you want to have some lunch
racine opens the door and goes out of the office
racine walks out of graces office
lowenstein watches him go
heather is absorbed in a magazine and roz is distracted with her cigarette
racine could keep on walking but instead he walks over to roz
she jumps when he speaks to her
she seems confused about how to act toward him
heather looks up casually
racine shakes rozs hand
how are you making out
were all right i guess
racine crouches in front of heather and smiles at her
you must be heather
he shakes her hand
im ned racine heather
ive heard a lot about you
its nice to meet you
heather nods uncertainly
im sorry our town is so hot for your visit

smiles stands goodbye
racine walks away
heather watches him go
roz turns to heather
racine walks down the sidewalk and enters stellas coffee shop
as racine comes in the front door stella is leaning over the counter in a gossipy huddle with a cop and glenda the meter maid
when stella notices racine she breaks off suddenly and moves away
the cop and glenda see racine and go back to their food with great deliberateness
racine takes all this in and settles at the other end of the counter
too boisterous hi racine

any hot news
nothing much doing
whatll it be
whats the special

he swivels around and looks out at the court house
lowenstein appears on the sidewalk across the street
he crosses over to stellas and comes in
converted to pdf by www
he spots racine and comes over to the counter with a light dance walk breaking into actual dance only as he pirouettes before landing in the stool beside racine
racine is almost done with his lunch
to stella the usual my sweet
two ice teas for fred astaire
lowenstein looks at racine and smiles
are you ready to hear something wild
i dont know
i may have had my share for the day
no this is right up your alley
stella puts the two ice teas in front of lowenstein
lowenstein has to give her a look before she backs away
lowenstein leans in confidentially toward racine
little heather comes out onto the back porch and this dude is out there with her aunt see
and hes turned away with his pants or shorts or whatever dropped so hes mooning the little girl right
and he and your friend are going at something which heather couldnt quite figure out
lowenstein begins to shake with laughter he almost falls off the stool
racine is confused
lowenstein recovers his balance and lowers his voice again
there are tears in his eyes
poor little heather
shes never seen one angry before
but it made quite an impression on her
thats all she can remember
lowenstein starts to choke with laughter
he takes a drink
racine is smiling now too
converted to pdf by www
one other thing
she says the guys hair was greasy
he wore it slicked back
like a cuban she says
i loved that
he laughs again can you imagine poor heather
she hustled back to bed after getting a gander at that
and listen to why she got up in the first place this is the capper
she had a nightmare
christ can you imagine what kinds of dreams she had the rest of the night
lowenstein rocks with laughter
and racine does too
matty has been pushed roughly across the entry hall
her back hits hard against the wall at the front of the central hall
she rubs her wrist where the skin is red and looks with frightened eyes at racine
dont say that
dont say you dont have them
i swear to you i dont
whats wrong with you
they had to be here when you cleaned up that night
think about it think hard
theyve probably got my prints on them
i must have missed them
i wasnt looking for them
i thought they were on edmund
so where could they have gone
i dont know
suddenly a look betty
matty nods thinking where would she have put them
youve been through his things
converted to pdf by www
she might have taken them
racine thinks thats crazy
listen to me
thats why i fired her
after edmunds death she started acting strange
she was always watching me listening to my calls
you imagined it
i know ive been imagining things too
no ned not with her i wasnt
i could tell there was a difference
maybe she know about us
maybe she wants something
dont you think we would have heard from her by now
matty walks over and sits at the bottom of the steps
she looks up at him
i dont know what to think
but its not about the glasses
or your friends
your first reaction is to accuse me
whats happening to you
i dont know if we can hold on like this
racine sits next to her
he rubs his eyes
hardin called today
he said everything should be cleared up by next week
ill get the money a caustic smile he apologized for the delay
theyve been stalling
theyre draggin it out hoping theyd come up with some way to implicate you
matty turns and leans against him looking into his face full of love
converted to pdf by www
but they havent been able to
soon itll be all ours
thats why weve got to hold together ned
it wont be long then well get away from here
out from under all this
a beat all we have is each other
id kill myself if i thought this thing would destroy us
i couldnt take it
his arms enclose her
oscar grace has been talking to the desk clerk who now disappears and returns with the hotel manager
oscar and the hotel manager watch as a data clerk extracts a sheet of freshly printed billing information from a computer
he points to a section of the read out
oscar talks to the parking attendant who handled racines stingray
oscar looks around the structure
the door to a hotel room is open in the foreground but oscar is down the hall looking at the door to the stairwell
oscar sits across the desk from a plainclothes cop who is talking on the phone
the plainclothes cop hears what he wants on the phone and nods to oscar tapping a spot on a list that lies before him
oscar gets up and looks to see where hes pointing
oscar can be seen inside talking to the attendant on duty
oscar totally beat sits in his car

its the middle of the night
bright under a full moon
and very quiet
the surf can be heard lapping at the beach
and then we hear humming
no sign of life
still the humming its a broadway show tune
lowenstein is there all alone silhouetted in the moonlight
he uses the rail like a ballet bar returning to it each time he finishes a small combination of dance steps
the moves are not extravagant there is not highkicking
just a nice smooth little combination that lowenstein is repeating again and again
he hums his own accompaniment
then softly at first from the distance comes the thumping of running shoes on old wood
it grows as lowenstein completes another repetition
when the thumping has gotten close it slows then stops raggedly
lowenstein looks that way
out of breath peter
racine walks up dripping sweat already extracting his cigarettes from his shorts
what are you doing here
ive been looking for you
you always run this late
im going to miami tomorrow
im not gonna have time
whats in miami
im closing this real estate deal ive been working on
converted to pdf by www
lowenstein nods and turns to lean over the rail
racine offers him a cigarette
lowenstein accepts and racine lights both of theirs
lowenstein glances at racines pack as racine puts it away
youre some kind of health nut
racine smiles matty walker smokes that same brand
i noticed that
is this gonna be one of those conversations
maybe i should have my lawyer present
buddy your lawyer is present
they look at the ocean
you know that edmund walker was a bad guy
the more i find out about him the happier i am hes dead
i figure its a positive thing for the world
youre not known for being a hardliner
i have my own standards
i try to keep them private
he looks at his cigarette as far as im concerned i dont care who killed him
and i dont care who gets rich because of it
shakes his head but oscar oscars not like that
his whole life is based on doing the right thing
hes the only person i know like that
sometimes its a real pain in the ass
even for him
lowenstein glances at racine but only for a moment
oscars unhappy right now
hes in pain
why is that
converted to pdf by www
because he likes you
he likes you even better than i do
long pause thats why hes been busting his butt trying to locate this mary ann simpson
they finally found her place in miami yesterday but the woman herself was gone
looked like she left in a hurry
a beat oscar thought any story she could tell might help you
he thinks you need help
racine turns around drapes his arms back along the rail and lets his head loll like a tired runner
someones putting you in deep trouble my friend
from about three thirty to five am on the night walker was killed someone called your hotel room repeatedly
the hotel didnt want to put them through but whoever was calling convinced them it was an emergency
the phone rang and rang but you didnt answer
racine looks at him
dont say anything
save it for some other time
it gets worse
he stamps out his butt now someones trying to give us edmunds glasses
we dont know who
we dont know what the glasses will tell us
but our negotiations are continuing
lowenstein steps away toward the street
he looks sad
i wish i knew what to tell you ned
but i dont have any good ideas
he turns and walks away
ill see ya
racine watches him go
he takes out his pack of cigarettes and extracts one
he stares at the pack in his hand
converted to pdf by www
the house is dark
racine tries the door a last time
hes still in his sweaty running clothes
no one here
racine peers inside one final time
he is looking through the new glass in the same little window shot out by edmunds gun
the wind chimes tinkle loudly
racines stingray whips south in the morning light
racine is shaved and showered and wearing a tie but he doesnt look fresh
his mind is elsewhere
he looks off to his left
miami sits on the horizon
the elevator is packed with lawyers
theyre heading out to lunch
they wear expensive suits
racine is backed into a corner
he watches them as though from a distance
he looks different from them
the lawyers pile out of the elevator
a few carry briefcases
racine finally appears
he too carries a briefcase
he looks across the huge lobby at the entrance to a restaurant bar
racine sits at the bar with a drink
once more he glances diagonally to the end of the bar at a guy in a three piece suit
the guy seems to be looking at racine whenever he isnt watching the front entrance
finally the guy can control himself no longer
he picks up his drink and walks around the bar to the space next to racine
his name is michael glenn and hes bright successful and irritating
the two men are on the edge of remembering each other
we know each other dont we
racine smiles uncertain im michael glenn
with bashford hillerman
the smile fades from racines face
it comes back to glenn in a flash
he wishes he hadnt come up
converted to pdf by www
christ ive done it again
embarrassed indicates the entrance im just meeting some people
glenn looks him over smiles hes ingratiating
hey this is silly
youre not still mad about that gourson business
racine shrugs takes a drink we had to do it
costanza practically insisted we sue you
listen nobody at our place likes malpractice against other lawyers
glenn remembers something
he smiles confidentially
i tried to make it up to you
racine looks at him blankly
did you ever meet a lady named matty walker
youd remember her
a very hot number
glances at the entrance yeah
i met her at a party
she said she was going up there and she wanted to know about lawyers
i gave her your name
when was this
trying to remember i dont know
racine stares at him
glenn sees his party at the entrance
he offers his hand
converted to pdf by www
oops gotta go
did you tell her about the gourson case
a slimy grin hey i was trying to get you work
he starts to move away
racine grabs him by his tie and pulls him back hard
the people nearby turn in alarm
racine speaks very quietly to the startled glenn
did you tell her about gourson
jesus are you nuts
racine twists his grip on glenns tie
glenn starts to choke
maybe i told her how we met
racine lets him go
racines stingray tears up the drive and squeals to a stop in the parking area
racine looks at the house from the car
it looks deserted as before
he pulls the stingray onto the lawn and drives all the way around the house then out the drive through his own dust
racine stares out at the ocean
he lights another cigarette and lifts a glass of bourbon to his lips
suddenly he laughs short and harsh
but the smile fades quickly
racine comes in carrying his briefcase
beverly looks him over critically he doesnt look so good

teddy too looks a little ragged

racine pushes his chair back
teddy seems torn about saying more
he forces himself to racine
dont thank me yet
these guys here theyve been asking me about the breakers
reads racines look i havent told em shit
but i dont like the look on their faces
racine gets up
racine listens to the endless ringing on the other end of his call and slowly hangs up
the phone rings in the reception room and beverly picks it up then hits the hold button
do you want her
he picks up hello
filtered throughout hello ned
can we talk
racine swivels in his chair so that he can see beverly in the reception room
beverly is just replacing the receiver on the hook and for a moment she gives racine a strange ambivalent look
racine watches her as she goes back to work and speaks quietly into the phone

racine puts down the phone and stares at it
teddy laursen watches as oscar grace and another detective come into the room
they look grim
teddy this is detective knapp from the fort lauderdale arson squad
hes brought some very bad news about that fire
seems there were two people who didnt get out
its the first time for him

teddy looks at him
teddy is hurting
the stingray passes the sign you are entering please drive safely the town looks well tended
racine comes down the lawn
he walks slowly toward the boathouse
his walk is unsteady
racine moves around to the front of the boathouse and steps onto its wooden porch
converted to pdf by www
racines focus is on the doorknob of the closed door
but he moves past it to the window
the curtains have been carefully drawn across it it is impossible to see beyond them into the boathouse
except for one little slice at the bottom of the window where the curtains are held apart a fraction of an inch by something
racine crouches down to look through the crack
what racine sees
the curtains are being held apart this little bit by a wire
a wire which is attached to the window and runs tautly back into the gloom of the boathouse
racine shifts his head an inch and he can see another wire
it originates from that same spot back in the gloom and runs toward the door although racine with this limited view cannot actually see where the wire is attached
but racine is not really trying racine has rocked back on his heels away from the window
he stands up and steps away from the boathouse
you might call it a stagger
lowenstein is in a chair
grace is turned away looking out the window at the dark street
they both look dejected
after a long silence stupid
thats always been the problem
a beat her mind encompasses his
i better go get him
the house looms darkly
racine has packed the stingray in the black shadows of the big tree behind the house hiding it
he starts to walk back around the driveway side of the house when something catches his eye at the other end of the house
he walks over there
close to that far wall in shadow as deep as the one he has just used is to racines surprise mattys mercedes
racine stares at the car
grace comes out of the house and walks to his car thinking
racine pushes aside some clothes and reaches up to a high shelf
he feels around until hes got what he wants
converted to pdf by www
he pulls down the wooden case and opens it
inside is edmunds
graces car is among a dozen held up by the raised drawbridge
a sailboat is gliding slowly through
grace is outside his car leaning against it
close on racines watch ten o five
the wind chimes on the gazebo tinkle
racine sits smoking in the shadows
he takes another drink from a glass of liquor
all the lights on the lawn gazebo and boathouse are off
racine hears something and peers toward the driveway
headlights move very slowly up the drive toward the house
it is edmunds cadillac glowing in the moonlight
the cadillac stops in front of the house and for several moments nothing happens
then matty gets out of the car waterway
she is wearing the same white dress she was wearing when racine first saw her and she is luminous in the moonlight
racine watches from the blackness of the gazebo
matty walks twenty feet past the gazebo and stops when she can make out the boathouse in the gloom
she stares at it a moment then turns back toward the house
racine steps to the edge of the gazebo
matty seems startled for only a split second
wheres your car
in the back
why havent you turned on the lights
i could see
matty comes up the steps and puts her arms around him
she closes her eyes as she hugs him
they are one figure melded in the gloom

its all ours now ned
we could leave tonight if we wanted
yes it is
voice changed whats this
suddenly she backs away from him down the steps her white dress moving back into the bright moonlight from the shadow of the gazebo
she looks up at racine
its edmunds gun
you remember it dont you
he has it in his hand now
he looks it over casually but the barrel is toward her
what is it ned
i think you know
i swear to you i dont
its the glasses matty

racine is at the bottom of the gazebo steps now
matty has backed away toward the waterway
i did arrange to meet you

i didnt plan that
racine laughs short and bitterly
you never quit do you
you just keep on coming
how can i prove it to you

the glasses matty
why dont you go down there and get them
matty is silent
she starts to speak but nothing comes out
now there is real fear in her eyes
but you said they werent there
i said i didnt see them
graces car moves down the drive
racine has moved closer to matty away from the house
they are only six feet apart
tears are now rolling down mattys cheeks
ill go ned

just as she is about to disappear into the shadows she turns back to him

no matter what you think i do love you
grace has gotten out of his car
he starts toward the front door but sees racine out on the lawn
he heads out in that direction but stops as racine steps into a bright spot of moonlit lawn and the guns shiny silverplate glints in the light
the gun is pointed at the retreating matty
grace pulls his own gun from a shoulder holster and raises it
he is about to call out when matty disappears completely in the gloom
racine lowers the revolver wearily and stares out toward the boathouse
grace lowers his gun and looks out there too
he moves slowly forward
close on racines face
its changing now
its not just that hes very tired
the hardness is going out of his look
as the seconds tick by and matty does not reappear he begins to lose faith in his view of the world
he begins to be afraid
afraid for matty
a sudden breeze starts the wind chimes tinkling loudly
dont go in
racine breaks into a run dropping the revolver on the grass
he has taken two big strides when there is a sound like the roar of a dragon and the roof of the boathouse lifts and then disappears in a huge
ball of flame
the air is sucked around racines body whipping at his clothes as he stumbles on the lawn and falls forward
grace steadies himself against the side of the gazebo
racine knows horror
he struggles to his feet and stumbles toward the fire
his body is silhouetted against the leaping roaring flames in the night sky
we move above cell after cell dark with sleeping convicts
we stop at racines cell
it is dark like the rest
racine is in there alone
we move down close to his sleeping form
he looks thinner

suddenly he wakes with a start
his eyes snap open wide he is totally and instantly awake
he talks to himself with true amazement
grace sits on the other side of the glass from racine
they talk on telephones
graces eyes are sad they say he thinks racine is going crazy
but what if that was someone elses body in there
what if it was already there when i got there dead and waiting for me
maybe her friend
her teeth were left man
we sent them back to illinois
the identification was positive
that was her that was matty tyler walker
that was her and shes dead
youre not listening to me
what if shes been using this other girls name
since she met walker three years ago since she first spotted him and decided to take him
one way or another
maybe walker or any of us never knew her real name
why would she want to hide her identity
i dont know
maybe there was something in her past something so bad she was afraid it would queer it with walker if he found out that hed never marry her
grace is unreceptive to this
but racine is charged
lets say shes living as the other girl this girl from her past
someone whose history she knew and could use any way she wanted
and theres only one person in the world who knows the truth

he leans in and then just when mattys got me on the line when shes finally going to collect that one person shows up
and threatens to expose her
so matty starts paying her off
maybe she even promises to cut her in on edmunds money
now shes got to share it with two people
racine peaks tapping the glass between them as though it were all there for grace to see
but when matty sees a way to get rid of both of them at once
a way to solve all her problems and get clear with no one looking for her
at the boathouse
you find two bodies me and this girl
two killers dead
oscar isnt buying
you cant find the money can you oscar
doesnt that tell you something
it tells me she moved it and we cant find it
and that dont mean shit
it could be sittin in any bank in the world waiting for a dead lady to come for it
racine calmer now shakes his head no
do you hear what youre saying
this matty wouldve had to been one quick smart broad
racine confirms graces fears with a look that can only be called half crazed
theres the glimmer of a rueful smile
oscar dont you understand
that was her special gift she was relentless
much quieter matty was the kind of person who could do what was necessary
whatever was necessary

these words have no special import to grace
he looks at racine without hope
racine you got to face something
you killed edmund walker man
and youre going down for it
two people are dead
and no matter how you want to figure it you aint bringin either of em back to life
grace gives him a long look then hangs up the phone
he stands up and walks away
racine sits and stares
racine bearded now comes to the front of his cell to get his mail
a trustee hands through a book size manila envelope which has been neatly opened by the prison authorities
racine looks at the return address and becomes very intense
he sits on his cot and slides out a book
a letter is clipped to the front
racine scans it quickly and begins looking through the book
it is an old high school yearbook
racines fingers are shaking slightly as they leaf quickly past black and white scenes of youthful innocence among the wheaton high school cougars of
he reaches the individual pictures of the seniors and hi hurries through the os and rs to the ts
racines eyes are darting over the pages
suddenly they stop
he has found her entry
we see it too home economics matty ambition to graduate the picture is not great
the pretty face is a little cheap looking
it is not the matty he knew
it is her friend from the back verandah mary ann
racines eyes dart
then he flips back a few pages
he finds what he wants english ambition to be rich and live in an exotic land
were very close on the type of her ambition when we pan up the page to her smiling face
her smile is so big she seems almost to be laughing
converted to pdf by www
thats the woman he loved
back to her picture
were moving in on it
and then through it to her real face this matty this mary ann alive and fine in the sun of one shot very close on that lovely face moving around
it in a tight half circle that barely lets us glimpse the sun drenched foreign town far below and the tropical foliage that surrounds the patio
for one brief moment she seems to be crying
but no it is not a tear
it is a little drop of sweat
she wipes it from her cheek as she turns to an unseen male companion who has spoken to her in spanish
she wipes her eyes and looks off at him
it is hot
she turns her face to the sun
