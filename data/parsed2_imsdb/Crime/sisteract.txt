we are in a parochial school classroom in the late sixties
the children all wear uniforms and sit at little desks
sister immaculata stands at the front of the room she is a middle aged nun very severe
the children are all terrified of her
who can name all the apostles
a thirteen year old girl sitting at a desk
she raises her hand
sister may i be excused
its an emergency
sister immaculata nods pursing her lips
christine stands and heads for the door
christine is now in the deserted st
annes girls room
she is standing on tiptoes looking in the mirror
she has taken her hair out of its neat barrettes she is combing it out
she applies lipstick
christine reaches into her schoolbag she pulls out a stack of glittery bracelets and slips them on
she unbuttons the top few buttons of her stiff white blouse
she sprays herself with dime store cologne
christine opens the girls room door she looks both ways
no one is around she saunters down the hall
christine opens this door
she looks into the closet
there is a very nervous thirteen year old boy waiting for her inside
christine slips inside the closet and closes the door behind her
striding down the hall with a bloodthirsty look in her eye and a nasty looking wooden ruler in her hand
she flings open the broom closet door in the broom closet
jimmys face is covered with lipstick
christines hair is awry
the couple has clearly been making out
outraged miss christine carter
dont you know what happens to girls like you
dont you know what they become
taped over a crack on a wall
the poster shows a glittering christy van cartier singing star of a fifth rate vegas lounge
christy wears tight spangles and a major wig on the poster
she has clearly lived up or down to all of sister immaculatas expectations
the camera pans through the dark bedroom in which the poster hangs a neon sign flashes outside the window casting a red and blue haze over the premises
a dressing room table is cluttered with dozens of bottles of nail polish and makeup and garish clothing and flashy jewelry are scattered everywhere
we hear the movement of bed springs as someone sits up in the dark
come on vince hold me a minute
id love to
babe but ive got to go
it was great
it was twenty minutes
vince larocca stands at the mirror adjusting his clothing and checking his hair
vince is a powerful charismatic man who rules an organized crime empire with personal magnetism and threat
vinces hold over christy is obvious if unfortunate he can seem expansive and generous one minute ruthless and dangerous the next
half to christy half to the mirror you are something else
christy turns on a lamp and lights a cigarette
come on stay
just a little
we can talk ill get a pizza
pizza in bed well have fun
and you still havent told me what happened
what did she say
what did who say
the other woman
vince turns to face christy turning on the charm
you are so damn sexy
how did i get so lucky
what is it now five years weve been together
who do i thank
not buying it today was the deadline vince
vince sits on the bed
he takes christys hand and kisses it
i want us to be together
honest decent people
in the eyes of god
i went to confession
you did what
for the first time in i dont know how long
i wanted everything done right
open and above board
i told father antonelli i was in love
i told him it was a special love for all the ages
starting to fall for it you said that
and what did he say
did he say you could leave her
did he say wed be happy
looking deep into her eyes he said that if i got a divorce id burn in hell
for all eternity
vince kisses christys hands again and drops turns away and starts putting on his shoes
outraged you want me to go against a priest
you think im nuts
trying to calm her we can still see each other
just like always
its a different kind of sin
vince backs off and starts searching for his jacket
babe its not me
i love you
you lying sleazeball
the best years of my life
what am i garbage
am i lint
vince ducks as christy throws an ashtray at him and it smashes against the wall
i should go
i hate to
a clock radio hits the wall beside vinces head
get out of here
and never come back
a lamp hits the wall as vince dodges it
he makes a phone gesture with his hand
vince kisses two fingers and blows the kiss to christy
christy is left standing on the bed holding a particularly garish stuffed animal she was about to hurl
with vince gone she slumps to the bed cradling the stuffed animal
she is caught between tears and rage
angle on various neon vegas landmarks the golden nugget caesars palace ballys etc
scrunched in between two larger hotels and casinos is the moonlight hotel and casino
the moonlight isnt all that small its just seen better days
a spotlight hits a solitary figure on a small stage
the man is caped and dramatic but not especially talented an elvis impersonator whos just a shade off in voice looks and style
good evening ladies and gentlemen
are you lonesome tonight
welcome to the moonlight hotel and casinos incredible platinum oldies spectacular
backstage theres still a look of resolve in christys eye as she waits to go on with michelle and tina her back up singers
but you cant quit
whatll happen to us
to tina tell her she cant quit
i told her
she stuck pantyhose in my mouth
onstage elvis glances into the wings to be sure the ronelles are ready
please welcome our own girl group extraordinaire our beehives of beauty the fabulous ronelles
the spotlight hits christy who wears a high beehive wig and a sequinned early supremes style gown
michelle and tina wear matching gowns and wigs
the band begins a doo wop vamp
this prom is a real drag
gasping what is it betty
look at that
get a gander
sighing hes so dreamy
a greek god
hes the cutest guy here
singing as they sing their moves and gestures are carefully choreographed in vintage girl group style
a lot of talent and hard work has clearly gone into the number
while christy does her best her singing voice is not on a par with those of the other ronelles
the lounge itself is practically empty except for a few drunken shriners and a couple of college kids
police lieutenant eddie mulcahy sits at a ringside table with his eyes locked on christy
an easygoing charmer eddie gives her a wink but she responds with an up yours look and a turn to the other half of the room as the song continues
a small cramped room with cracked plaster walls and a sputtering fan for ventilation
christy has her own dressing table and mirror and the ronelles share a table a few feet away
clothing and costumes hang on nails or are draped over chairs as the girls change into street wear
screw this dump
its a roach motel with sequins
every guy i meet is either married a cop or a lush from des moines
but what about us
you taught us the act
the songs all the moves
and where did it get me
im stuck in this rathole
youre holding me back just like vince
i should be headlining
a pock faced weasel of a man named joey opens the door and leans into the room
what do you want
this is a private area
you aint got nothin i aint seen
then stop trying to memorize it
hit the road
joey takes a step into the room and sets a box on the chair near christy
michelle and tina hover around the box very excited
they pick it up trying to tempt christy
michelle and tina cant restrain themselves they open the box
inside is a rather gaudy fur coat
michelle and tina are impressed
its a fur
its a bribe
five years of my goddamned life
so you earned it
vince owns the casino
cash in i should throw this in his facet theres a knock on the door and tina opens it
lieutenant eddie mulcahy enters
christy is not pleased
what is going on here
to heaven why me
whose dog did i kill
eddie picks up the coat
what a guy
doo lang doo lang
at least hes not a cop
at least he can afford a decent gift
i used to buy
on your birthday
when we were seeing each other
yeah like what
quilted coat hangers that your mother picked out
a travel iron
so i dont shop
cause youre always out arresting people
i dont know why i went out with you in the first place it was embarrassing
i couldnt hold my head up i used to tell people you were a security guard
well how do you think i felt
you were singing in bowling alleys back then
i told people you were a hooker
calm down you two
its always like this
yeah well now she goes out with a better class of people
hes a businessman
when are you qonna wake up
when are you gonna get off my case
have you got a search warrant
what do you want cheap thrills
i thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience
and get out of here
my regards to vince and the mrs
christy hurls a jar of cold cream at eddies head
he ducks and the jar hits the door
christy is standing absolutely furious
im not taking it from him and im not taking it from vince
from now on its all about me
and if i cant spend it drink it or sleep with it its gone
like sister immaculata used to say life is short and then you fry
so long girls see you in church
christy grabs the mink and heads out the door
ernie schmidt sits across the enormous mahogany desk from vince
the young mans throat is dry hes sweating bullets
the presence of joey the weasel and willy a brutal thug increases ernies tension
how long you been with us ernie schmidt
three years mr
one behind the bar two as croupier
vince gestures to the lush office and its furnishings
ernie you know whats important to me
its not all this
this is what
thats me ernie
vince gestures to joey who takes out a revolver and points it at ernies head
you aint been loyal ernie
what did you tell the cops
ernies eyes open wide with denial as the gun comes closer to his temple
holding the coat christy waits by the elevator
it arrives she gets in
the interrogation continues
i didnt tell the cops anything
joey slams ernie on the side of the head with the gun
christy steps out of the elevator and faces a maze of office cubicles with half wall partitions
the floor is deserted and dark as she makes her way through the cubicles
vince is standing over ernie holding his head up by the hair
who else ernie
who else was in on it
moaning no one
dropping ernies head in disgust why am i wasting my time
beyond the cubicles christy strides down a lush corridor to an executive suite
she tries the knob but finds the door locked
pulling a key from her purse she unlocks the door to the suite and enters a large outer office with a reception area and doors to several inner offices
she tosses the key onto the receptionists desk
wont need that anymore
crossing to vinces office christy squares her shoulders and narrows her eyes with anger as she reaches for the doorknob
she pauses for a second and then doubles her resolve
to joey angle on the door to the office which opens
christy appears with the mink coat in her arms
stuff this up your
a gunshot is heard
christys eyes widen and her jaw drops at what she has just witnessed
angle on the office
ernie is slumped in the chair dead
joey stands over him holding the revolver
joey willy and vince stare at christy
icy calm christy tries to speak she cant
is there a problem
with the coat
christy glances around the room she doesnt move
she quickly sizes up the situation
she tries to appear matter of fact
unaffected by what shes just seen
is that why you came up here christy
to thank me
and to say youre sorry
about this afternoon
and the things you said
do you understand
catching the subtext right
vince crosses the room to christy
he takes her hands in his and kisses them
thats my girl
my girl in mink
will you be home
christy kisses vince quickly
at the apartment
christy reaches for the doorknob without looking at the door
she fumbles a bit
she finds the door
christy walks backwards out the door
she turns she is gone
vince is she
considering this i mean wont she talk
she seemed kind of upset
making a decision bring her back
for a talk
and if she runs
icy take care of it
with guns drawn willy and joey run after christy
christy clearly terrified is walking quickly away from vinces office
she passes through a glass door which leads to the cubicle area
long shot of the cubicle area which resembles a darkened maze
christy hears joey approaching she runs into the cubicle area
he only wants to talk to you
angle on christy crouched behind a half wall
she is clutching the coat
there is a stuffed toy a garfield the cat attached to the wall near christy with suction cups
christy tries to pull the cats feet off the wall very quietly
christy finally just yanks the cat off the wall
she hurls it as high and as far as she can to the opposite end of the room
angle on the flying stuffed cat
joey sees the blur of the cat he shoots it and the cat explodes
come on christy
theres no place to go
christy steadies herself against a xerox machine
she accidentally activates the machine which lights up and starts humming
angle on willy as he hears the xerox machine
he quickly moves toward the sound
willy reaches the xerox machine the area is deserted
he starts moving quickly down the aisle a chair the kind on casters comes rolling out of one of the cubicle doorways the chair hits willy and he falls
christy runs out of the cubicle willy is on the floor struggling to get up
as christy sprints away willy shoots at her
he misses but a glass partition shatters
christy runs for an open elevator but it has been summoned from another floor and the doors are beginning to close
she runs even faster
a bullet whistles past her ear and hits the back wall of the elevator
she reaches for the doors a moment too late and the elevator is gone
christy scrambles to the door beside the elevator and runs into a stairwell as two more bullets bite pieces out of the door
taking the stairs three at a time christy is flying still clutching the mink
the thugs are gaining on her
a bullet hits metal and ricochets off several walls and steps
at the next landing christy opens the door and ducks into a corridor
exhausted but powered by adrenaline christy sprints past doors to the end of the hall still with the mink
joey appears from the stairwell just as christy ducks into a supply room
christy shoves a cleaning cart aside and wades through a pile of dirty linen
joey opens the door just as christy dives head first into the laundry chute
christy lying atop the mink flies through the chute like a subway train through a tunnel
the chute spits christy out like a bullet into a huge bin of dirty linen
two workers glance around as they load large washing machines with laundry
christy climbs out of the bin and dashes for a door
working in a hotel the workers have seen everything
joey flies through the chute
joey suddenly flies into the bin
he climbs out with his gun in sight
the workers point to the door and joey rushes across the room
one of the workers is now wearing the mink coat
joey comes out of the hotel and finds an empty street
he looks in every direction but the nearby streets have swallowed christy into safety for the moment
the central offices of the las vegas police department
eddies office is a glassed in area set in the middle of the stations main floor
christy is huddled in a chair surrounded by eddie and two other detectives clarkson and tate
right between the eyes
down and out
the guy was gone
i couldnt believe it
you couldnt believe it
vince the prince
i never said he was an altar boy okay
but he sent his goons after me
they tried to kill me
im not kidding
what did you expect
vince is as dirty as they come
weve been finding bodies around here for years
i dont know anything about bodies
i mean he didnt bring it home
he was good to me
he was sweet
he took care of me
who am i supposed to go out with
he owns a casino
he let me sing
he didnt do you a favor
come on shell sing great
when she sings for us
sing like testify
are you nuts
i just want you to protect me
we dont have time to be bodyguards for anyone who comes in here with some cockamamie story
mink coats and laundry chutes
unless of course youre willing to testify
what is this some squeeze play
cant you just protect me without any strings
the three detectives move in closer now and really apply the pressure
we could put you into our witness protection program
a hiding place
a new identity
but youd have to agree to testify
the whole nine yards
and if i dont
then you run
you listen for the footsteps
then one day they find you
they open a window
its ten flights up
ten flights down
all over the sidewalk
and into the street
i get the picture
ill do it
to tate get a stenographer
christy looks to eddie for a bargain now
okay heres what i want
i know about this stuff
a five star hotel
with room service
and ill need a new look
like a disguise
no calvin klein
and a limo
and my hair up
it could work
jesus what do you think this is wheel of fortune
let me spell it out for you
you have to hide like you dont even exist
you have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight
confused okay no limo
whatre you gonna do put me in a bag and bury me
im gonna put you in the last place on earth that vince would ever look for you
christy doesnt like the sound of this at all a page
jesus delivers the sermon on the mount in vibrant red blue and green stained glass
an organ plays a hymn badly
notes are missed skipped over and mutilated
pan down to a procession of nuns who march into a chapel at the ancient st
the organ isnt getting any better and we see it is being played by sister alma a seventy year old nun with arthritis and a hearing aid
apparently the hearing aid is malfunctioning because sister alma doesnt seem to realize how badly shes playing
as the last nun in the procession enters the chapel she closes the door behind her
across the lobby the front door opens and eddie enters with a very reluctant christy
to eddie i hate you
i totally hate you
safest place in the world
you think vince would look for you here
as christy looks around the lobby various religious artifacts loom at her we see them from her terrified p v
angle on a crucifix casting an ominous shadow a stack of hymnals and a large framed sunday school style portrait of st
there are nuns here
its crawling with em
its a convent
all you have to do is shut up behave yourself and get along
im gonna go back work things out with vince
christy turns to head back to the entrance but eddie catches her arm
vince has put out a contract on you
a hundred grand
youve seen him in action
christy searches his eyes for a lie but realizes hes telling the truth
but vince loves me
how could he
i mean five years
and one bullet
thats all its gonna take
suddenly scared but vince has contacts all over the place
this is san francisco
theyll be looking for me
everywhere but this little hole in the wall convent
nobody knows youre here but me
were trying to get a quick court date
a month maybe two tops
ill spring you as soon as i can
panicking i cant stay here
ill crack up
eddie what am i gonna do
smiling from inside the chapel the choir begins to sing a hymn horribly
the voices dont blend and individual notes are real migraine material
christy looks aghast
eddie urges her into a corridor and she follows
the office is bare and austere
mother superior sits at her desk with her hands folded
like all the nuns at the convent she wears the traditional full length habit and wimple
mother superior is in total command of all she surveys and she seldom raises her voice or her blood pressure as she rules
control is her passion within the walls of the convent she has created a world she can trust because its a world she controls
but mother superior is not in control at this particular moment
bishop george ohara stands before her with a majestic presence and some bad news
i am very sorry but no
we can save this young womans life and imprison a parasite all in one gesture
but shes been exposed to the underside of life
she is the underside of life
and therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation
were a small convent bishop
surely there are
more appropriate shelters
your small convent is in danger of closing reverend mother
the las vegas police department has offered to make a generous financial donation
katherines is a benedictine order
you have taken a vow of hospitality
to all in need
smiling mother superiors jaw locks
she realizes she is stuck with the situation and will have to control it as best she can
there is a knock at the door and eddie and christy enter
everything is in order
bishop maybe a cup of coffee down at the corner
the thought of being left alone with mother superior panics christy like a child left in the principals office
hey youre not leaving me alone
reassuringly youre never alone in this house my child
eddie touches her gently on the arm
one month two tops
a last ditch attempt opening the door to leave lieutenant
eddie and bishop hara are leaving by the convents front door
as they exit they hear the choir singing horribly
they both wince at the sound and then chuckle
christy is pacing outraged at her new situation
they put me in a convent
whats the problem
wasnt there any more room in hell
very calm what is your full name
your christian name
dont you understand
this is all a mistake
im the good guy
im the witness
and im being punished
christy van cartier
thats my real name
currently im a singer
oh my god
this isnt happening tell me this isnt happening
its a nightmare im back at st
you were unhappy
i was expelled
when i was fifteen
what do you think
heavy petting without a chaperone
heavy petting with the chaperone
and wearing a black bra under my uniform
the demon bra
i have to get out of here i have to make a phone call
dont you get it
im in a convent
youre a nun
very stern sit down
mother superior rises
she is an extremely imposing woman
christy sits in a wooden chair across from mother superior
miss van cartier
belligerent your cigarette out
christy inspects her cigarette
ruefully it has come to pass
i joined this convent some thirty years ago
at that time the world knew some measure of peace
our order was a beacon of hospitality to families to children to a neighborhood filled with promise
and as the years have passed i have watched that promise destroyed
staring at christys outfit spandex
so i have made this convent an oasis a retreat from horror
and now that horror has invaded these sacred walls
are you talking about me
and all those like you
you mean black people
i mean the wicked
and their las vegas concubines
very suspicious whats a concubine
check your drivers license
christy stands facing off with mother superior
look the way i see it im stuck here right
i mean im here or im target practice
so heres the deal i dont bug you you dont bug me
ill catch up on some sleep watch some tube lay back and lay low
so just get me a key and show me to my room and do not disturb
suspiciously gracious of course
but its almost lunch
is there a menu
before we do you might like to freshen up
and youll certainly want to change sniffing her clothes the same outfit shes had on since the night at vinces office deal
a small room with a sewing machine some bolts of fabric and several wooden cabinets
there is a wooden screen in a corner marking a changing area
christy is behind the screen we hear her but do not see her mother superior stands beside the screen catching the various items of clothing which christy tosses to her
how about a robe
one of those big terry cloth jobs with like embroidery on the pocket
guest of st
katherines would you like that
mother superior takes christys skirt and blouse and tosses them down a chute marked incinerator
you should hand wash that blouse and send somebody out for some things
i look good in reds purples hot pink and shoes
five inch heels
fuck me pumps
oh man sorry
scuse my mouth
mother superior carries christys lacy bra at the end of a ruler it goes down the incinerator
open the cabinet to your left
you will find appropriate attire
a group of nuns are praying their heads bowed
they hear a muffled scream from elsewhere in the convent
they look up puzzled
christy is standing before a full length mirror staring at herself in complete shock
she now wears a habit and wimple
mother superior is doing final adjustments on the wimple
almost unable to speak no
i cant do this
normally dressed you are a sore thumb and you endanger us all
while you are here you will conduct yourself as a nun
only i shall know who and what you truly are
you will not disrupt the convent
you will not influence the sisters with your colorful street talk
you will draw no attention to yourself in any way
furious in disbelief but look at rites look at this
im a nun
im a penguin
as of now and until you leave you are sister mary clarence
outraged mary clarence
like a guy
like a dumb guy
mother superior is striding down the hall
christy is beside her trying to get the hang of her new outfit
the mary is in deference to the holy mother the clarence in honor of saint clarence loyola
there are three vows that every nun must accept
the vow of poverty
pulling out her pockets no problem
the vow of obedience
like to who
and the vow of chastity
im outta here
christy starts to leave mother superior grabs her by the wimple a large whitewashed gothic room with oak beams and a crude iron chandelier
there is a long central wooden table with rough wooden benches
the convents population is standing around the table in silence
there are about thirty nuns in all
mother superior moves to the head of the table with christy following her
she motions for christy to stand at her right
good afternoon sisters
i apologize for my tardiness
i would like you to welcome a new member of our order sister mary clarence
angle on sister mary robert the nun standing beside christy
sister mary robert is naive and mouse like but very sweet
she has only been at the convent a few years she wears the simpler habit of a novice
she sneaks a look at christy
her eyes widen and then she resumes staring at her hands
mary clarence comes to us from a somewhat more progressive convent
she is eager for a more disciplined life and will make every effort to conform to our ways
everyone sits including christy
sister mary patrick a nun seated at the middle of the table waves her hand
mary patrick is extremely cheerful a truly upbeat person
yes mary patrick
reverend mother on behalf of the sisters id like to welcome mary clarence to st
angle on christy looking thoroughly disgusted
as part of our welcome ive had a little thought just for fun
could we have our new friend offer todays blessing
angle on the nuns watching christy
reluctantly very well
mary clarence rise please
christy stands up slowly aghast
like for lunch
angle on mary patrick beaming
she and the other nuns bow their heads
trying to recall a blessing for what we are about to receive
so far so good
mother superior has one eye open
may the lord
prepare us and
watch us and
walk through the valley and be our shepherd and
to the republic for which it stands
god bless us every one hallowed be thy name
angle on the nuns staring at christy
mother superior rises very quickly
sisters for the rest of the day we shall declare a vow of silence
surely you are familiar with this practice mary clarence
only when our lips are silent can our prayers truly be heard
mouthing the words
without speaking aloud oh my god
christy reaches for a piece of bread
and mary clarence
christy looks up
as a new member of our order i think you might also enjoy a ritual fast
mouthing the words a what
to remind us of the poor of those who must endure without enough to eat
mouthing no food
taking away christys plate no food
not until sundown
angle on christy clutching her fork hungrily watching the other nuns eat
vince leaves the police station with his henchmen joey and willy and larry narren an attorney
vince is steaming as they walk through the parking lot
they grilled me for six hours in there
and my hotshot lawyer where the hell were you
it takes time vince
slow and steady
weve been through this before
vince reaches his car
as joey opens the door for him another car drives by and stops
eddie is driving he leans out the window
so long vince
see you soon
vince lurches toward eddie larry restrains him
eddie drives off chuckling
hes so damn cocky
this is different
its a bluff vince
you know so much
theyve got christy and weve got to find her
get her x from in front of the lounge
fax it to every contact we got
larry covers his ears with both hands
i cant hear this
im an attorney vince and youre just an honest casino owner
object of a witch hunt
keep the message vague but let em know
the price has gone up
christy van cartier a quarter of a million
dead or nearby
vince looks grim and vindictive as he gets into the car
the vegetable patch is located behind the convent on a patch of land surrounded by high walls
various sections have been partitioned with string and then furrowed
several nuns are working in the patch weeding and raking
they wear large ungainly straw hats over their wimples
christy has been given a hoe and a straw hat
she is hacking at the dirt with great disinterest
she picks up a carrot from the vegetable patch she looks around to see if anyone is watching
she starts to gnaw on the carrot
she becomes aware that someone is watching her
she looks up
sister mary robert is watching christy eat the carrot breaking her fast
christy drops the carrot on the ground as if it burned her
mary robert resumes hoeing in the next furrow over
christy stares at mary robert narrowing her eyes
christy looks around all the other nuns are busy at their tasks
christy decides that she will try and make sister mary robert talk
she picks up the carrot and tosses it at mary robert
mary robert jumps
she waggles a finger at christy scolding her
mary robert resumes hoeing
christy is now determined
she takes her hoe and tiptoes nearer to mary robert
very gently she uses the handle of the floe to lift mary roberts skirt and gooses her
mary robert vips very loudly
all the other nuns turn and stare at mary robert scolding her
christy waggles her finger at mary robert scolding her
christy giggling to herself resumes hoeing
she sees mother superior standing at the end of the furrow
mother superior looks extremely grim she has not missed anything
long shot of the sun going down ending the nuns vow of silence
we hear christy scream o
this hallway is marked by a series of heavy wooden doors with tiny grilled windows
these are the cells where the nuns sleep
nuns are entering their cells and closing their doors for the night
mother superior glides down the hall followed by a dusty bedraggled christy
christy is devouring a slice of brown bread
is this all the food i get
dont you have any snacks
they stop by a door
this shall be your cell mary clarence
the door swings open and mother superior and christy enter
the room is tiny with bare plaster walls
there is a narrow wooden bed with a thin muslin covered mattress
there is a small nightstand and a wooden stool
looking around you were right the first time
is this like solitary
wheres the furniture
our lives are simple
we have little need for material possessions
right sure thing
but what about like appliances
like a little color portable
sinking to the bed its like the stone age
the room time forgot
what about a phone
and whom would you call
oh i dont know
not amused your cell is more than adequate
so what do we do now
row over to the monastery
it is nine p
my days just starting
if i were you i would use this time to think about my life
and its direction
or lack thereof
indignant whats wrong with my life
from all ive heard just about everything
your singing career seems all but nonexistent and your married lover wants you dead
page if youre fooling anyone its only yourself
god has brought you here
take the hint
mother superior leaves
after the door shuts christy stands and looks out the one small window in her cell
she leans her head against the wall
she is trying not to think about what mother superior has said
still the mess her life has become overwhelms her
she fights back tears
the sun is just barely rising as the convent bell tolls
christy is fast asleep
there is a rapping at the door
sister mary clarence
all the nuns are proceeding in their simple robes and nightshirts down the hallway
christys door opens she is still in her nightshirt and her hair is a mess
mary robert in her nightshirt stands outside
come on were late
what time is it
its after five
we have to bathe
groaning five a
christy is standing on line in the hall along with several other nuns they are waiting to take showers
they carry soap and towels
sincerely isnt it a glorious morning
good morning mary clarence
is this like your old convent
which convent was that sister
it was um the little sisters
of the moonlight
everybody used to come to mass
right at ringside
mary lazarus is a much older nun she is very no nonsense a hard liner
it sounds awful
it sounds just like this place
like this place
i like my old convent in vancouver
out in the woods
it wasnt all modern like here
those were nuns
it was hell on earth but i loved it
this place is a hilton
a stone room that is very medieval looking
one wall is divided into stalls by wooden partitions
in each stall is a nun standing beneath a crude shower head that releases a thin stream of lukewarm water
we see only the nuns heads and shoulders
still sleepy christy leans against the wall of her stall her eyes closed
lost in thought she begins singing softly to herself
very softly christy looks up from her reverie she looks around
the other nuns are bathing their eyes down
there is no sign of singing
christy decides to try a test
still very softly the nuns giggle
where did that come from
i havent heard that song in ages
very grouchy shirelles
you know that song
mary clarence thats when many of us took final vows
its the last secular music we recall
cutting off the song thats enough
weve got to get to chapel
mary lazarus leaves the bathing room and the other nuns resume scrubbing themselves
christy looks around
anybody got conditioner
bishop ohara is leading the sunday mass
he stands in the pulpit
the choir nuns stand in a fenced in area to his left
the remaining nuns including christy and mother superior sit in the first few pews
we are a small congregation this morning
too many mornings
something has gone terribly wrong
where is faith
where is celebration
where is everyone
still rather than regret the absence of our neighbors let us rejoice in the fellowship of those present
our choirmistress sister mary lazarus has informed me that our choir while always superior has been toiling especially hard on this weeks selection
mary lazarus raises her hand and the choir begins singing
they sing a traditional hymn let thy thoughts be guided
as always their singing is dreadful they have no tempo or pitch and the hymn becomes an off key drone
as the hymn continues the camera pans over the chapel
aside from the nuns it is almost empty only a few elderly people are in attendance
sitting with the other nuns
she is clearly about to fall asleep
then the choir hits a particularly horrendous note and christy jerks awake
she immediately tries to assume a pious expression tilting her head and folding her hands in prayer she looks like a somewhat demented sunday school calendar
detective clarkson gets out of his car and hurries into the police station
clarkson crosses the busy room to eddies glass walled office
along the way he signals detective tate to follow him
eddie looks up from his desk as the two detectives enter
there was a raid on a pawnshop in l
the place was fencing stolen property
they found this
clarkson gives eddie a fax sheet showing a publicity photograph of christy
data base hoods
its a wonderful world
reading the fax sheet beloved daughter missing
reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
please find our adored angel we miss her so
dead or alive
vince is getting desperate
where is she eddie
whered you stash her
you wont even tell us
i wouldnt even tell the pope
a plain whitewashed classroom with battered student style desks
a group of about eight local teenage girls has gathered
the girls wear extremes of hair makeup and clothing they are bored and scruffy clearly the local bad girls
sister mary patrick is leading the class in her usual perky manner
good afternoon young ladies
and welcome to our christian youth group
the girls make grunting noises
i hope well have some fun and maybe learn a little something too
now todays topic is something very up to date teenage promiscuity
now can anyone tell me just what is promiscuity
angle on the girls exchanging glances and rolling their eyes
mary patrick points to a girl in bicycle pants
a bustier and a leather baseball cap
her name is lawanda
uh its like you know doin it
a whole lot
till your head falls off
blushing well yes
that is one way to put it
mother superior enters the classroom accompanied by christy sister mary patrick
i need to see you at once

girls this is sister mary clarence
shell be minding you until sister mary patricks return
mary clarence please assign a biblical passage
do not attempt discussion

mother superior and mary patrick leave the classroom
christy now stands at the front of the room
she is visibly uncomfortable
so hi there
sister mary clarence
i guess i should assign you this passage
what were you talking about
we were talking about the wild thing
page after a beat really
sister mary pat was discussing it
you know she thinks its a sin
trying to behave well
yes it is
goading christy how come
still trying to behave well
because its in the bible
thou shalt not
thou shalt not
the girls all laugh and make jeering noises
excuse me just what are you all doing here
at sunday school
cause we love it so damn much
and cause we gotta come here
we all got caught
cuttin up some bitch with a blade
so we gotta come here
so well be good in the future

getting fed up yeah you learned a whole lot i can tell
well what would you know about it anyway
what do any of you nunheads know about anything
about doin the nasty or gettin high
leave her alone lawanda shes just some ol nun
dont pick on no nun its bad luck
fed up shut up
all the girls look up stunned by christys language
okay so maybe im a nun so you want to ask me something
you want to listen for once in your little lives
you want to pay some attention
what about crack
you a user
i said i was a nun not an asshole
all the girls jeer at charlene
got you charlene
dunked by the nun
more sincerely well what about the sex stuff
what if some dude is after you and hes always saying stuff commin on sweet and mellow
like oh baby you know youll love it
oh baby if you loved me youd stay
and you listen to that
i dont know
hey i know its hard
but do what i do
puzzled what you do
just tell him i do love you but i cant im a nun
the girls all laugh they are really beginning to like christy
but like what if you are doin it
what about protection
what about them things you know for the guy
arent they like a mess to put on
dont they kinda mess up the mood
deal with it sweet thing
its important nowadays
you just practice at home with a balloon and a banana
mother superior has returned with mary patrick
everyone has been so wrapped up in the discussion that no one has noticed their entrance
thinking on her feet because a banana is part of a balanced breakfast
and dont forget fiber
mother superior is seated behind her desk she is very angry
christy sits across from her
a balloon and a banana
tell me mary clarence what were you thinking
those girls were asking questions
theyve got it rough
i wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age
i wish somebody would talk to me about it now
this is a convent not a clinic
we offer moral guidance not hardware
have you been out in those streets
do you know what those kids are up against
you should help them
we are nuns
we seek solutions through prayer
sometimes its not enough
you are correct
sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation
such as your own for example
how do you feel about physical labor
it never solves anything
do your recall the words of saint peter in ecciesiastes
he spoke unto a wastrel youth
he said take up thy task and know ye the path of contentment
how to put it
ah of course mary clarence
no pain no gain
mother superior smiles in a rather evil manner
vince is on the telephone in his office at the moonlight hotel and casino
he clearly has a new mistress or two
very seductive baby you know i do
i feel it too
can you hold
a second telephone rings and willy answers it
vince meanwhile has pushed a button on his phone and is involved in a second romantic call
soon you gorgeous thing
its that call you were expecting vince
can you hold
can you try
willy passes the phone to vince
t page have you found out where christy is yet
hey bozo you re on my payroll
you want to try making it on a cops salary
find her and find her now
vince passes the phone back to willy
raise the ante to three hundred grand
willy heads for the fax machine
vince regains his composure and picks up his own phone he pushes a button
not a stitch
yeah im naked too
this is a large open room where the nuns create various gift items which the convent sells to support itself
several nuns sit at a table diligently hand painting christmas cards and making christmas tree ornaments
on the other side of the room is a large free standing loom which resembles a grand piano
the loom is wooden a tapestry is half completed
mary patrick is seated at the loom which is a complicated mechanism
christy stands beside her
the minute i saw you
i said to myself shes a weaver
have you ever used a loom
not in years
well it all comes back in just a jiffy
im working on a wall hanging of the convent
to sell of course
i hate to say it but were in terrible trouble here at st
we need a new roof the furnace is going and theres no money
but dont you get money
from the vatican
were completely self supporting
like all convents
at my old place we used to
isnt it lovely
now ill demonstrate and then you can hop right in
as she deftly works the loom you just draw your beater in keep it pressed against the pick and open the shed
then pass your shuttle beat and open the next shed
beat beat shuttle beat shed
keep tension on the warp
is that clear
pretending to be fascinated just about
show me again
angle on the wall hanging which has progressed considerably
angle on christy leaning against the wall thumbing through a magazine
angle on mary patrick hard at work at the loom
shuttle beat shed
and watch your heddles
i love my heddles
show me again
mother superior appears
mary clarence how is your weaving progressing
oh shes doing just fine reverend mother page
really catching on
mary patrick i need you in the office
mary clarence carry on
mother superior gestures to the loom
christy sits at the loom and waves as mother superior and mary patrick exit
christy stares at the loom a look of horror crosses her face
she has not been paying attention to mary patricks instructions
she cracks her knuckles as if she were about to play the piano
she grabs two parts of the loom at random
she moves these parts
angle on the loom
as a result of christys movements the loom collapses piece by piece
the tapestry unravels the many skeins of wool snap and the mechanical apparatus disintegrates until finally the entire loom shudders and falls to the floor as christy watches aghast
mother superior is striding down the hall she is livid
christy trails behind her trying to keep up
im sorry im not a weaver
months of work and the loom absolutely ruined
look this isnt my kind of thing
i wasnt cut out to make little tapestries or knit little sweaters
i dont do that
im a star
mother superior stops dead in her tracks she turns and stares at christy
then she smiles in a rather frightening manner
a on her hands and knees
scrubbing the stone floor of a convent hallway
b crawling along between the pews in the chapel oiling every inch of wood with a bottle of polish and a rag
c crawling along the convent roof cleaning out gutters with a trowel
she discovers a dead rat in one of the gutters
page d sewing she is repairing a hole in a habit
the camera pulls back
christy is sitting in a small stone room surrounded by piles of torn habits linen and other mending
christy is on the phone in the darkened office
she keeps checking the door to make sure no one is listening
into phone let me talk to detective eddie mulcahy
its an emergency
christy cups her hand around the phone and speaks quietly and frantically
intercut between christy and eddie
eddie youve got to get me out of here
you cant keep calling
somebodys going to catch on to where you are
but im going insane
all these people do is pray and work work and pray
i dont get it whens the weekend
they have gruel eddie thats what they call food
gruel its like alpo for nuns
i sleep in a cell on a board and i pray five times a days do you know what i pray for eddie do you have any idea
check your crotch eddie anything fall off yet
get me outta her
look i didnt want to tell you this but weve had some problems with our protection program lately
keeping our witnesses alive
we hide them but theres a leak in the department and they end up dead
you son of a bitch
page i just need a few more weeks but its a nightmare
mother superior is out to get me
she hates my guts
she keeps thinking up new kinds of torture
in the distance christy hears the choir practicing they sound even worse than usual
holding the phone out do you hear that
eddie in here thats what they call music
dont call again
its not safe
ill be in touch
as the line goes dead mother superior enters
christy takes her dust rag and pretends to polish the receiver
she sings as she works
still singing christy breezes out of the room
mother superior looks mystified
christy is lying flat out on her bed in her habit utterly exhausted by the weeks hard labor
there is a meek scratching at her door
without moving yeah
sister mary robert enters very shyly
she barely looks up
what does she want now
i did the dishes
i oiled the pews
i dusted the hymnals
two hundred hymnals
why cant people share
not speaking above a whisper page
i brought you something
an extra heel of bread
please take it you need your strength
youve been working so hard
mary robert holds out a rather rugged crust of brown bread
christy takes it
so which one are you
until almost whispering mary robert
nice to know you
mary robert nods and resumes looking at her hands
she doesnt eave but shes still tongue tied
christy is at a loss
so bob how long have you been in
yeah like a learners permit right
when do you hit the big time
you know when do you take the final vows
mary robert bursts into tears
whats going on here
whatd i say
still sobbing you have to help me right sure but whats the problem
are they keeping you a prisoner here
do they drug you
did reverend mother like kidnap your parents
we can call the enquirer
no you dont understand i dont want to get out
i want to get in
mary clarence im so unworthy
i want to take my final vows i would do it tomorrow but reverend mother wont let me
she says i should wait
she says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life
she says that im not experienced enough to make the decision yet
in a mature manner
she said that
mary robert nods solemnly
suddenly from the streets outside the convent we hear a blast of hot dance music and the sound of laughter and carefree conversation
well then theres only one thing to do
reverend mother says you need experience right in life
in order to make a responsible decision
this is going to be very painful for me
you know how much i love this little room
this whole convent
christy stands and goes to the crucifix hanging on the wall
she speaks to the crucifix and listens as if jesus is advising her
to jesus must i do this thing lord
please help me
yes i know
i must put my selfish cares aside
i must think of others
yes shes here
she gestures to mary robert he says hi
yes i understand
let thy will be done
christy turns to mary robert having received a holy message
we must do this sacred thing mary robert
desperate of course
we must do it
its the will of god
what is it
shutting her eyes for the full spiritual effect we must
get you some experience
leave this place
are you sure
another blast of music from the street
christy turns to the crucifix
she gets confirmation
to jesus we hear you
the outer wall of the convent
a door swings open and christy sticks her head out
she looks both ways and steps outside
she beckons to mary robert who appears from behind her
mary robert looks very wary
christy pulls her along
christy and mary robert walk along a street a few blocks from the convent
looking around cautiously are you sure this is what reverend mother had in mind
i know it is
take a deep breath
christy breathes deep and then lets out a whoop
she spins letting her habit billow around her
shocked mary clarence
mary roberts eyes widen
she points to herself me
mary robert lets out a tiny little whoop and does a little timid hop
its a start
a neighborhood hang out the windows bright with neon beer signs
the exterior is colorfully painted the club all but explodes with good times
a group of teenagers lounge on the steps sipping beers and smoking
among the teenagers are the girls from christys christian youth group
christy and mary robert approach and the group falls silent
how are you doing
puzzled hey sisters
are you going in there
you know it
we need experience
remembering shes a nun its part of st
katherines new community outreach program
how old are you
you shouldnt be smoking
have you ever seen a diseased lung
hand em over
lawanda reluctantly hands over her cigarettes
christy turns to a teenage boy whos drinking beer
and you with the devils brew passing through your lips
holding out her hand a mind is a terrible thing to waste
the boy hands over the beer
christy and mary robert enter the club
christy enters the club and grins
she takes a drag on the cigarette
mary robert grabs the beer from christys hand and takes a swig
shocked bobs experience
the club is alive with activity the bar is crowded couples are making out at small tables and the dance floor is packed
the atmosphere is a combination of hazy darkness and colored lights the club should have the feeling of a hot neighborhood party with people of all ages and races
the music percolates and christy starts to move to it
she and mary robert find a table in the corner and signal a nearby waitress
a couple of bowls of chili
holding up the beer and another round of these
the waitress looks at the two women strangely the club has never hosted nuns before
to the waitress confidentially i have to do this
so i can become a nun
to the waitress initiation
later on we make her wear her underwear on her head
page to the waitress and she wants to be a nun
the waitress leaves shaking her head
christy and mary robert watch the action at the club
across the room mike the bartender stares at the nuns especially christy he tries to place her
who are all these people
this is your neighborhood
you should get to know em
from across the room mike the bartender continues to study christys face
he takes out a copy of vinces fax photo and stares at it
he covers christys hair in the photo with his hands creating a wimple
there is no question in his mind the two are the same
mike has a dangerous look in his eyes as he takes a gun from the drawer and slips it into his pocket beneath his apron
there is a live band on a small stage at one end of the club
they start playing a hot dance number and the club really begins to cook as the dance floor fills
christy and mary robert both still seated start to move with the music
a very good looking local dude comes over to the nuns table
he is clearly amused at their presence
hey sisters how you doin
flirting better now
how come they let you out
out of that convent place
for bad behavior
a nun havin fun
i dont believe it
its good to have you ladies in this fine establishment
anybody on the move
standing up i am
whatre you doing
mary robert leads the dude out onto the dance floor
im getting experience
to the dude you watch yourself
christy decides shed better keep an eye on mary robert she grabs another dude and heads for the dance floor
as the music percolates christy and mary robert dance christy is very hot and mary robert picks up on her moves
the club patrons are delighted and cheer as the nuns start to get down
do it sisters
sway and pray
as the song and the nuns exuberant dancing peak the club patrons cheer shouting hallelujah
christy and mary robert are walking back to the convent
they are both in very good spirits
those people are wonderful
why dont we ever see them in church
especially that dude you were with
id like to see him down front
giggling mary clarence
different from the other sisters
sometimes you sound more like a layperson
as the two women laugh together they dont notice the car that begins to follow them creeping slowly forward with its headlights out
i cant wait to tell reverend mother about all my experiences
ive learned so much
well you know you dont have to tell her everything
i mean nothing really happened
took a walk
the cars bright lights suddenly switch on and the nuns turn startled
the car hurtles toward them
they scream and christy grabs mary robert and throws her out of the cars path the two women land on a pile of garbage bags
struggling to her feet christy sees the car go into reverse and then pull forward again
she sees a glint of light reflect off a gun as the cars driver mike the bartender leans out the window
to mary robert run
christy shoves mary robert towards an alley
as she does so the gun goes off with a red flash
the shot misses the two women and shatters a plate glass window of the store behind them
running up the alley christy and mary robert hear mikes footsteps chasing them growing louder as he gains on them
christy grabs the ladder of a fire escape and shoves mary robert up the ladder ahead of her
as christy and mary robert climb the fire escape another gunshot echoes in the alley ricocheting off the fire escape
the nuns climb higher up the building
mike pursues looking for a shot between the steps and the landings but not finding any openings
he takes the steps two at a time and begins to gain ground
at the fourth floor landing christys heel gets stuck in the grating
she pulls frantically at the laces
mike arrives at the landing just as christy twists her toot out of the shoe and surprises him with a lunge for the gun
mikes hand is knocked back against the metal frame of the fire escape and the gun flies loose rattling down the metal steps to the landing below
christy shoves mary robert into the open window of an apartment and follows her in
christy and mary robert leap into the bedroom of an hispanic couple their arms wrapped around each other in bed
at the womens entrance the couple looks up stunned to see two nuns in their bedroom
oh my lord
pushing mary robert forward experience
the couple continues to look stunned as the nuns race out of the room
christy and mary robert run up to the side door of the convent they catch their breath
what was all that
who was that man
why would he shoot at us
i dont know some people just dont like nuns
i wish i had a ruler
we could have been killed
but you saved me
throwing her arms around christy thank you mary clarence
the door to the convent swings open
mother superior is waiting
yes thank you so much
page christy sits alone outside mother superiors office listening to the loud ticking of the clock on the wall
she seems small and vulnerable like a child sent to the principals office
the door opens and eddie emerges from the office
whatd she say
you blew it big time
she doesnt want you back
does she know people are trying to kill me out there
shes counting on it
shes concerned for your safety but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you
or a carnival
so what am i supposed to do in the meantime
go in and talk to her
it cant hurt
urging her go
reluctantly christy rises and approaches the door
she looks at eddie who motions her to go in
she finally does
mother superior is working on some papers at her desk as christy enters
christy is trying to figure out a strategy
not amused and not looking up i dont believe we have anything to say to each other
i know i shouldnt have im incredibly sorry about mary robert i wasnt thinking i didnt know that would happen
mother superior glances up from her work
she is justifiably outraged
mary roberts life was in danger
your behavior was inexcusable
im sorry i didnt mean for it to happen
and i was the one they were shooting at
mary clarence i have given you every opportunity
to make a decent life for yourself
a decent life
clearly you have learned nothing
and you present an ongoing threat both to this convent and to yourself
but you cant kick me out
guys want to kill me
youre a nun
a big nun
arent you supposed to have compassion
for the wayward sheep
i mean im a major sinner
all time great
hall of fame
arent i like your dream come true
your olympic event
mother superior stares at christy
mary clarence perhaps you are correct
surprised i am
you may stay
but i shall restrict your activities to but a single task
with great dread what
you have i believe some minimal background in music
therefore you are to join our choir
page you will sing and you will sleep that is your schedule until you depart
as almost no one attends mass you will be unable to cause further damage
smiling youre my olympic event
not the choir please anything but that
the choir i mean have you heard them
ill do anything scrub floors toilets you name it but not that i in triumph the choir mary clarence
go for the gold
there are twelve nuns in the room going over sheet music
mary lazarus is the groups leader mary patrick and mary robert are also in the choir
christy appears at the door grimacing
come on in and sing a spell
christy spots mary robert
mary robert i am so sorry about last night
now stop that
you didnt shoot at me
you were only trying to help to give me experience
i tried to explain that to reverend mother but i dont know if she understood
mary lazarus cuts off this chitchat thrusting a hymnal at christy
soprano or alto
very gloomy whatever
mary lazarus hands christy a hymnal and raps her baton
the choir begins to sing christy doesnt even bother trying
she is horrified the choir is the worst sounding group in history
they seem to be singing in several random keys and they even have trouble with the words
no one looks up from their hymnals
sister alma the organist with the hearing aid is plodding along
mike the bartender is taking chairs off tables and setting them on the floor as joey and willy enter
were looking for mike
you found him but were not open yet
willy grabs mikes arms and bends them behind his back
hey the tills empty
willy slams mikes face into the wall stunning him
joey lifts mikes groggy face and offers sympathy
im sorry i dont know what gets into him
who are you guys
were the guys from vegas
you had christy last night but you let her get away
willy hammers mikes face into the wall again
but you didnt tell me
we didnt tell you what
that shes a nun
that chick youre looking for shes a nun
im telling you
willy and joey look at each other and consider this
then they burst out laughing
they refuse to believe mikes story
gimme a hand here
willy and joey pick mike up and hurl him over the bar
then they exit still laughing
the choir continues its dreadful rendition of the hymn let thy thoughts he guided
christy is not singing she is clearly in pain
mary lazarus stops the song
one of the nuns has to nudge sister alma to stop her playing
mary clarence are you with us
um i dont really know this one
mary clarence has a background in music
thats what reverend mother said
eagerly really mary clarence
were you a choirmistress
circling christy free lance
you think i dont see
you think i took vows yesterday
i know what youre up to
you and reverend mother
youre a ringer
she brought you in to replace me
out with the old
mary clarence could you
mary lazarus youre terrific but
to christy could you help us
youve heard us
everyone falls silent
mary lazarus walks across the room eyeballing each member of the choir
theres a word for this mutiny
to christy so mary clarence you think you can do better
i believe id like to see that
she hands christy her pitchpipe and baton im out to pasture
the glue factory
go ahead sister make em sing
everyone watches christy
to nary lazarus with all due respect
lets have a look at this
christy goes over to the piano
she examines the sheet music for let they thoughts he guided
she sits at the piano beside sister alma
christy picks out the hymn on the piano accompanying herself
christys singing voice is as usual not very good
she stops singing
for perhaps the first time in her life she has really heard herself
i sound like you guys
victorious very nice
sisters have we learned our lesson
i wont hold this little episode against anyone
ill try not to
standing mary robert
mary robert jumps startled by the attention
mary robert ive watched you
you never really sing
nothing comes out
i dont want to mess anyone up
to sister alma give me a c
because sister alma is hard of hearing sister alma plays the note
christy points the baton at mary robert
mary robert whispers the note
like youre onstage
mary robert sings a little louder
like people are eating and theres silverware and you want them to hear you
mary robert sings louder still
think about that guy you were dancing with
mary robert finally lets out her full voice which is huge and glorious
after singing a single perfect note she stops abruptly she has scared herself
weve got the voices
theyre just allover the place
ive heard all of you in the shower youre decent
better than me
we just need charts harmony chops
lets rearrange a few things
mary patrick you re not a natural soprano youre an alto
get over here
mary robert with the sopranos
the two nuns trade places
sister alma a c
sister alma plays the note and the nuns try to duplicate it but the results arent much better than before
christy uses her pitchpipe she circulates among the nuns giving each her note urging them closer to pitch
middle section hold that note for dear life
sopranos an a
sister alma hits the note
christy shuffles a couple of more nuns to other sections then gets a third note going with the altos using her pitchpipe
for one moment the nuns all realize they are singing a perfect chord
they are elated
we did it
we actually sang a chord
thrilled and disconcerted that was exciting
yeah for one second
that was the blend youve got to listen to each other
be a group
under her breath i knew that
mary lazarus i get the feeling that you like discipline
im a nun
four popes now
the lord hates a loafer
i hear you
how many days a week do you rehearse
an hour or so
were a choir right
the big room
two days a week wont cut it
impressed shes good
to christy do you really think we could do it
i dont know
mary lazarus what do you think
theyre pretty raw
wet behind the ears
a bunch of real mamas girls
cant we try
christy and mary lazarus look at each other as real comrades
christy leans on mary lazarus shoulder
itll be hell
tell me about it
christy and mary lazarus shake hands firmly
christy turns to the choir very businesslike
this is a basement utility room
a large industrial washer dryer stands along one wall the machine makes a repetitive chung chung sound page
the choir nuns are busily doing laundry some iron others fold sheets others stack towels and garments on a long table
christy is helping mary patrick fold a sheet
everyone is working rhythmically to the drone of the washer dryer
its a rhythm section
christy starts clapping her hands to the sound of the washer dryer gradually the other nuns join her
mary patrick do you remember the dixie cups
the dixie cups
i was just a girl
singing stopping the beat hold it
mary patrick youre a pretty cheerful person arent you
there is a murmur from all the other nuns oh yes
as a confession all right i am i know it
all my life ive just been
i cant help it
even when i was little i remember my mother used to say that child is pure sunshine
shell either be a nun or a stewardess
so use it
when we sing hymns theyre usually about rejoicing right
most music is
so dont hold back
let all that joy go right into your voice
make me happy
let me hear it
with real joy because were the nuns have really gotten into the song with christy encouraging them verbally
they are sounding better and better
sister mary frederick a member of the choir steps into the laundry room and lets loose with a sudden piercing whistle
the nuns immediately stop singing and a moment later mother superior enters
the room is quiet except for the sound of the washer dryer
the nuns all get very busy at their laundry tasks
in unison good morning reverend mother
good morning sisters
mother superior takes one more glance around then leaves
now that the coast is clear the singing begins again quietly to the rhythm of the machine
bishop ohara is leading the sunday mass
welcome this sunday morning ye few and faithful
as usual the chapel is almost empty except for the nuns
the choir is in place behind the pulpit
the choir i am told has elected a new director sister mary clarence who will lead them in hymn
christy nods to the bishop and signals to sister alma who begins the accompaniment
they sound fantastic
their voices blend with a heavenly harmony as they sing the slow melodic hymn
mother superior is startled by this new sound
lawanda and her friends glance at the convent with curiosity as the beautiful music drifts out to the street
a few other heads turn but with only mild reactions
at the end of the first verse christy signals the choir to stop
theres a hush in the chapel as christy glances at the vacant pews
then she turns to sister alma and nods
sister alma strikes a bold stirring chord
several of the nuns blink
bishop ohara glances at the organ with surprise
mother superior sits up with a stiffened back and a severe expression
as the chord grows in force christy gives the choir a beat
one two three
the choir begins a radically new version of the same hymn
christy strides up and down in front of the choir transforming the song into a rousing gospel anthem with a passionate call and response format
what you say
i think i hear it
you know i just might
spontaneous reactions from everyone in the church
the gorgeous exciting music pours into the street
everyone turns to look
windows open and people glance out
the street takes on a new movement
the choir really lets loose flow
lawanda and her friends peer in at the back door of the chapel
bishop ohara sees them and beckons them to come in
sister alma inspired by christy and the choir burns up the organ with a solo
more people from the street begin to enter tentative curious drawn by the music
at the end of the solo christy makes a gesture to the choir and each member produces a tambourine
the chapel is full of energy music and life
mary robert sings really letting the power of her voice ring out
she is astonishingly good
the new visitors to the church begin to clap in rhythm to the music and after a few beats the nuns join in
mother superior is aghast
the choir builds to a huge gospel finish all keeping their eyes on christy
you know what were saying
i think they hear you
after the final note everyone in the chapel is exhilarated everyone except mother superior
christy looks out at the congregation that has increased by a dozen or more including lawanda and her friends
christy looks happier than she has in years
the members of the choir are all gathered outside mother superiors office leaning close to the door and listening to her harangue christy
they are surprised to find themselves joined suddenly by bishop ohara and part to let him through
he leans down to the keyhole and listens
mother superior is livid
a jazz solo on the organ
jesus goes to rio
good friday a go go
what were you thinking
i was thinking las vegas
get some butts in those seats
and what next
this is not a theater
or a casino
people like going to theaters and casinos
but they think church is for grandma we could change that
pack the joint
you have corrupted the entire choir
thats not fair
i worked hard with them
they gave up their free time and they loved it
those women are happy
and we can get even better
we can wake this place up
out of the question
please let me try
im begging you
and i am refusing
as of tomorrow mary lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir
christy is crestfallen
there is a knock on the door and ohara enters
the other members of the choir are in behind him like sardines
reverend mother i just wanted to congratulate you
i havent enjoyed mass this much in years
what a marvelous program
you are to be commended
i cant wait until next sunday when the choir performs again
did you see the people walk right in from the street
that music that heavenly music it called to them
i must tell the cardinal
send him a personal letter describing your efforts your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive
christy has just been eating this up with a spoon
excuse me bishop
reverend mother has some other ideas too
shes too modest to talk about it but she thinks we should get out of the convent and into the neighborhood more
putting her hands on mother superiors shoulders this woman
mary patrick jumps forward
there are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve
thats why many of us became nuns
its marvelous reverend mother
confused by the turn things have taken really
with regard to mother superior you know reverend mother
hides her light under a bushel
she has plans for us to move right onto the streets
get to know people
work with em
to mother superior youre a pioneer
but bishop surely you realize this is a most dangerous neighborhood
and youll face that danger head on
as if i could stop you
and you have my complete support in this matter
anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing
hugging mother superior from behind dont you love her
the nuns are out in force painting the walls of the convent mostly with rainbows and flowers and bright shining suns
the camera pans to christy who is adding her own original touch to the mural using cans of spray paint
christys section includes an image of a nun in a miniskirt and spike heels accompanied by neon letters that read st
people gather in the street watching the nuns activities
the convent begins to crackle with energy and life
a drug deal is going on in a house up the street but the dealers give only a curious glance to the action at the convent
from the window of her office mother superior watches the painters and feels her control slipping away
christy leads the members of the choir down the middle of the street
they get lots of attention each step of the way
as each nun raps the other nuns make rhythmic boom box noises
rapping rapping rapping page
rapping the parade goes on the crowd gathers and a general air of jubilance prevails
the rehearsal room is filled with high energy as the choir is separated into several groups
christy has got the whole thing running like a disciplined broadway cast
mary patrick leads one group in the corner as they practice synchronized movements with tambourines
colorful streamers are tied to the tambourines and they make colorful patterns in the air
sister alma pounds the piano with newfound energy as mary robert and the sopranos reach higher and higher for notes theyve only dreamed of in the past
christy and mary lazarus have corralled the rest of the nuns into a practice of intricate dance steps somewhat like the temptations in skirts
mary lazarus keeps the beat with a yardstick
dont look at your feet and i dont want to see anybody counting
make it look easy
right right cross with the left spin and turn
hopeless i amateurs babies again
one of the drug dealers stands outside the crack house as a car suddenly pulls up to the curb
he starts toward the car as the driver rolls down the window but before he gets there christy and several nuns surround the car
were here to pray for you brother
get the hell out of here
we know you dont want to sell drugs
you just had an unhappy childhood and maybe a learning disability
you just need someone to pray for you
we know you dont want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors
well pray to find you some honest work
and we know that even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite the lowest slug of humanity
we know that deep down inside youre probably even worse
and so you truly need our prayers
what is this
outta my way
the nuns give him room and the driver zips off down the street
a small crowd has begun to gather and it is growing by the moment murmuring encouragement for the nuns
christy turns to the dealer as other cars drive slowly past
yes prayer is the answer and prayers free were going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house
to the dealer were nuns
to cruising cars free prayers right over here
drive up and get your prayers
youre hassling my customers
thats not legal
i know my rights
this is restriction of trade
you wanna call a cop
the dealers eyes turn ugly as he takes a gun from his pocket
mary patrick steps forward
are you going to shoot us all tough guy
is it worth it
a lot of witnesses here
to the crowd can i get a witness
the dealer glances at the surly crowd then gives the nuns a disgusted look
he puts the gun away
so ill find another neighborhood to do my business
you can t stop me
if we can stop you here they can stop you there
the dealer turns and walks back to his house with anger
the crowd applauds and cheers
the picture suddenly becomes grainy and we hear the voice of a news reporter
it was a truly remarkable scene as the nuns from st
katherines literally drove the crack dealers from the neighborhood led by the feisty sister mary clarence
camera pulls back and we see a tv screen with an image of the nuns and neighbors still celebrating
on top of the tv are several framed photographs of vince laflocca his wife and children
vince laroccas living room night connie larocca vinces wife watches the tv news story and calls to vince in the kitchen
vinnie get in here
you gotta see this
carrying a roast beef sandwich and a can of beer vince appears from the kitchen and glances at the tv screen to see a shot of the convent
he looks at connie and makes a sour face
you got me in here to see nuns
isnt there a ball game on or something
vince turns away from the tv just as a closeup of christy appears on the screen
look shes adorable
vince leaves the room and we see christy again as she leads the choir
eddie is cooking spaghetti in his efficiency apartment and watching the news on tv at the same time
he pours himself a glass of wine and stirs the spaghetti sauce
this tiny convent has experienced an amazing turnaround
the sisters have revitalized and taken back their neighborhood all due to the energy and talent of the convent choir a group led by this gifted young nun
tell us mary clarence what makes you so special
trying to appear modest and nun like oh im not special bob
its just hard work
eddie all but spits out his wine
his eyes are wide as he watches christy being interviewed
in one stride he grabs his hat and coat and is out the door on the run
the sunday morning bell is chiming as crowds of people stream into the convent
the entire neighborhood looks cleaner and the people walk with a spring in their step
three local tv stations have remote news crews on the scene doing follow ups on the story
last in line christy follows the other choir members down a hallway toward the chapel
suddenly a hand reaches out and grabs her and a second hand covers her mouth as she is pulled into an empty cell
shocked and terrified christy struggles to free herself but is suddenly relieved to see that her abductor is eddie
eddie releases her and she falls onto the bed
you scared the hell out of me
what if i was vince
youd be dead right now
what are you doing giving interviews on tv
it wasnt my fault
they just showed up
its helping the convent
youre supposed to be hiding out
i really cant talk about it now
the place is packed
ive got a show to do
listen to yourself
this isnt a career opportunity
i know that
this isnt about me
its about the choir
you should hear them
and i taught them
jesus look at you youre glowing
i mean it
ive been worried about you
eddie sits on the bed beside christy
you mean worried about my testimony
no worried about you
ive been thinking about you
i mean there arent a lot of guys around here
i mean sometimes i feel like
most of the time im thinking about you
youve really changed
you re sort of
your eyes are shining
youre rea ly different
eddie and christy are gazing into each others eyes they are just about to kiss
their lips are less than an inch apart
youre a nun
eddie and christy jump apart their intimacy has frightened them both particularly given christys outfit and their location
were in a convent
christy goes to the door
ive got to go
just remember youre a target
dont you think vince has a t
trying to think straight i know i know
ill be careful
christy begins to leave and then she turns filled with a performers excitement
christy hurries toward the chapel leaving eddie to shake his head and wonder
sister alma plays the organ and the choir hums quietly as christy addresses the congregation
cameras from several tv stations are focussed on her from various places in the chapel
this sundays hymn is inspired by the lesson of mary magdalene
you know the one
mary magdalene was a young lady with a past
she was no stranger to sin
she was no stranger to practically everybody
many condemned her
the whole neighborhood
but one man refused to do so
one man said hey now wait a minute
listen to the story
sister alma starts playing a doo wop vamp
mary patrick and mary robert step forward from the choir standing beside christy the way the ronelles used to do
jerusalem is a real drag
everybody hates me
people throw stones
they call me names
i mean really
what is it mary
that man who is he
hes a carpenter
page hes not like other guys
the full choir sings back up while christy mary patrick and mary robert perform intricate girl group choreography
sister alma is surrounded by several street kids who play guitar bass and drums to accompany the organ and choir
lawanda and her friends sit in a pew moving joyously to the music
eddie stands in the back of the chapel watching a christy he has never seen before
christy is now glowing with happiness and confidence
as the song continues we see the chapel is packed to the rafters
a tin bucket is passed around as a collection plate and it overflows with money
church services are over and happy people stream out of the convent but they dont hurry home
standing in groups they talk pleasantly and make plans for the day
there is a real sense of neighborhood up and down the block
eddie comes down the steps glances back at the convent smiles to himself then crosses the street to his car
christy and the choir stare at the collection plate that is filled with money
two buckets this is so exhilarating
all week long i cant wait till sunday when we sing
id rather sing than do anything
its better than ice cream
its better than springtime
its better than sex
everyone looks at christy with astonishment
catching herself i imagine
everyones attention suddenly turns to bishop ohara as he approaches
better and better sisters you are truly an inspiration
and i bear gladsome tidings
the choir gathers around ohara with curiosity
ive kept the cardinal informed of your progress in the neighborhood
he has been most impressed
and he has invited you to attend a special evening mass at st
matthews cathedral on sunday night to sing for the council of cardinals
the choir reacts with an excited buzz the council of cardinals
what shall we sing
mother superior appears from the center aisle
that is indeed glorious news bishop
we will be honored to appear
and on such an occasion i feel a completely traditional program will be best
what do you mean
the council of cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire catholic church
they command the utmost respect
secular entertainment would be wholly out of place
but reverend mother everyone loves our new style
its brought people back to the church
isnt that why we were asked to sing for those cardinals
i believe this can be settled by a simple vote
mary clarence a convent is not a totalitarian state
most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole
a membership that i am certain will vote in a rational and pious manner
all those in favor of allowing mary clarence to select a program
all the nuns look at one another
then slowly one by one they all raise their hands
mother superior is pure steel at this moment her expression betrays no emotion
christy on the other hand is quite confused
wait a minute
the majority has spoken
reverend mother as always you are a true leader
gracious and understanding
it will be wonderful reverend mother
gesturing to christy shes a pro
i am certain the presentation will be a great success
congratulations mary clarence
and congratulations to you all
the nuns cheer and cluster around christy chattering about the upcoming concert as mother superior strides off
seated at her desk mother superior glances up as christy enters
you sent for me
you have a phone call
mother superior continues with her paperwork as christy picks up the phone
good news kid
i pulled a few strings the judge has agreed to move the trial up
well be in court in a couple of days
with mixed emotions christy speaks softly
mother superior is a very interested eavesdropper
forty eight hours and youll be a free woman
thats good to hear
hey dont thank me or anything
right right thanks
christy hangs up the phone
she looks at mother superior
hey your prayers have been answered
in just a couple of days
well that makes two of us
i have submitted my resignation to bishop ohara
i have asked to be relocated as soon as possible
i must go where i can be of use
but theres so much more to do right here
and look if its about me i mean im gone
after how long
a few weeks
i have been here thirty years
and yet it would seem i know nothing
but everything thats happening is good
you can be a part of it
a part of what
mary clarence it is one thing to rabble rouse to sweep into town and declare a holiday
you have raised the sisters expectations you have excited and confused them
they imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party
you and i know that life is not so simple
there will be disappointments
and you will have vanished
okay so i just got things started
but you could build on that
you could keep it going
i am sorry mary clarence
i seem to have misplaced my tambourine
good day mary clarence
christy frustrated leaves the room
mother superior looks up she is truly torn a proud woman unsure of her choices
the moon casts shafts of silver light down to the courtyard of the convent
most of the lights in the neighborhood are out at this late hour
whispering come on
ive got a surprise
the kitchen is dark lit only by a flickering candle carried by christy
three more candles appear carried by mary robert mary patrick and mary lazarus
the door to the freezer opens and light spills out
christy removes several pints of ice cream and distributes them to the nuns
delighted ice cream
mary clarence you shouldnt have
where did you get this
its a sin
its a wicked indulgence
is this butter almond
christy and the nuns sit on stools enjoying their ice cream by candlelight
but i wanted to give you a treat
a sort of
thank you gift
a thank you
youre the one we should be thanking
is there any syrup
see at my old convent i wasnt always
i was sort of selfish and
not real helpful
okay ill say it i wasnt much of a nun
but now thanks to all of you
maybe im shaping up
mary clarence dont be silly
youre an example to us all
youve taught us so much
were singing for the cardinals and then who knows
maybe the choir can travel to schools and nursing homes
maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us
we could cut a demo
look for a label
knowing she has to leave thats true wouldnt that be great
of course we never know when things are going to change
any one of us could be transferred to another convent tomorrow
worried are you leaving us
sincerely oh no
well always be together
thats what diana ross said
christy and the nuns qiggle and continue eating their ice cream in a spirit of true friendship
mother superior watches this scene hidden in the shadows by the door to the kitchen
she has begun to see christy in a new light
she looks thoughtful and walks off
tate sits at his desk in the detective room reading the sports section
henry parker the accountant for the police department looks stressful as he enters the room and heads for eddies glassed in office
tate glances up as parker passes his desk
youre too late
mulcahy just left
i need his signature on some things
they cant be processed without it
hell sign em later
parker looks annoyed he doesnt like deviations from procedure but after a moment of indecision he sets the file folder on tates desk and walks away
tate finishes the newspaper and shoves it aside
bored looks at his watch then flips the file folder open and glances at its contents routine money vouchers for equipment supplies etc
tate is about to close the folder and shove it aside when something catches his eye
what the hell is this
he examines a money voucher for a generous donation to st
katherines convent in san francisco
it only takes a moment to put two and two together and tate scrambles for his phone and dials a number
henry parker waits for the elevator
when it opens hes surprised to see eddie step out
tate said you were gone
i get all the way down to my car and of course where are the keys
i left the money vouchers with him
he said youd sign them in the morning
eddie nods and moves on as parker enters the elevator
after a few steps eddie suddenly looks disturbed
he picks up his pace
a little panicky he begins to jog toward the squad room
vince is on the telephone
he signals joey and willy and they move quickly toward him
this is it
get ready to move
grab her get her to the moonlight
we meet there and we take care of her
into phone were on it
give me the address
vince begins to write down the address
tate is hunched over the telephone talking quietly with his back to the rest of the room
the voucher for st
katherines is in his hand as eddie moves quickly toward him
katherines convent on east barton
its gotta be the place
tate hangs up the phone and boom
eddie hits him from behind like a linebacker drilling him to the floor
other detectives look up from their desks with confusion and alarm
eddie pins tate to the wall and snatches the voucher from his hand
youre the leak you son of a bitch
clarkson and another detective restrain eddie before he can hit tate
get him out of here
downstairs in the cell
i want his ass locked up now
nobody dares even question eddie at this moment and two detectives drag tate away
eddie grabs tates phone and dials long distance
clarkson get on the other line
call frisco central
tell em to get two squad cars outside st
katherines convent and stop anybody with an out of state license plate from getting near the place
clarkson dials quickly
eddie listens to tates telephone as it rings and rings and rings
all the nuns are in the chapel as the choir rehearses a hymn along with gina and her girlfriends
those who are not in the choir clap their hands in rhythm
war in the background we can hear the telephone ringing
eddies police car streaks past an entrance ramp with the siren screaming
it blazes through traffic weaving in and out at breakneck speeds
a moment later joey and willy pull onto the highway at a fast rate
the race is on with eddie securely in the lead
in the rehearsal room the choir members are putting on their robes
christy and several nuns are all trying to primp in front of one small mirror
the council of cardinals
im so nervous
what if i forget the words
right to hell
where is that bus
it should be here any minute
with a clipboard dress rehearsal at four performance at
christy looks out the window but sees no bus
eddies police car streaks toward l
the neighborhood has turned out to see the choir off
banners hang from the fire escapes of the building across the street st
kates the greatest
good luck a catholic school bus pulls up to the convent and parks in front
several nuns in choir robes come outside and hurry onto the bus
a moment later eddies police car streaks up to the side entrance of the convent parking around the corner from the bus
eddie runs into the convent and finds mother superior at the bottom of the stairs
they know shes here
theyre on their way
mother superior points up the stairs
the rehearsal room
mother superior looks alarmed as eddie takes the stairs two at a time
looking out the window mary robert sees the bus
everyone makes a final check of their appearance and then the group leaves the room to head for the bus
mary robert and mary patrick are the last to leave except for christy
im right behind you
christy primps in the mirror one last time then leaves the room
she is puzzled to suddenly see eddie running toward her from a side staircase
eddie grabs her hand and pulls her toward the side staircase
vince knows youre here
shocked and scared how
his goons will be here any minute
weve got to get you out of here now
christy and eddie hurry down the steps to the side entrance and she almost trips on her choral robes
eddie opens the door and starts outside but christy stops in her tracks
i cant go with you
ive got a show at st
were singing for the cardinals
youre gonna be singing for st
peter if you dont get your ass out of here
eddie jerks her hand and christy follows him reluctantly to the car
eddie takes off at a fast clip up the street
as the car cruises through an intersection christy looks back at the bus with confusion and sadness
she sees the other nuns rushing back into the convent to look for her
several members of the choir rush into the room with panic in their eyes
its no use
she just isnt here
it doesnt make any sense
she was right behind me
the horn on the school bus blows loudly down in the street
we cant sing without her
what should we do
calming herself well pray and shell be there
the nuns are calmed by the tone of mary patricks voice
they leave the room to join the others on the bus
eddies police car streaks through crowded streets
christy still looks unsettled
eddie ive got to go back
they wont sing without me
im deserting them
i think theyd understand
thats not the point
they need me
eddie glances at her impressed by the influence the convent has had
they need you
a bunch of nuns
make up tips
you dont get it
its a big thing for them its like
theyre singing for the cardinals
if first prize was a trip to the vatican
theyve worked really hard they deserve this
goading her nuns
theyre not nuns
with one outfit
joey and willy park their car in front of the convent get out quickly and climb the steps to the front door
they ring the bell
so that guy in the bar was right
some kind of nun
yeah right when i see it
lawanda and her friends watch joey and willy pounding on the convent door
you dudes looking for nuns
they all went to st
praise the lord
joey and willy run past the girls get into their car and take off
eddie glances at the dashboard and sees that the fuel gauge is close to empty
he wheels into a gas station and pulls up to the tanks
christy starts to open the door but he stops her
whatre you doing
even nuns have to pee
he lets her go then gets out to pump gas
christy enters the bathroom it is deserted
she fondles her rosary beads and sinks to her knees
this position doesnt work for her she stands
she looks around her she glances up toward heaven
she decides to do things simply and speaks in a matter of fact tone
okay its me
its chris carter
i need some help here
i cant believe im doing this
okay look i know i should just get back in the car and get the hell out of here
save my skin
i mean its not wrong vince really wants to kill me
why do you make guys like vince
but if i dont sing at st
it means so much to them
theyre counting on me and i like that
maybe reverend mother is right maybe i am a bad influence maybe im just some vegas slut but
can we cut a deal here
i mean i still dont believe in like most of the commandments and stuff in church still gives me the willies but if i go back and sing if i
do a good deed will you promise i wont get killed
all i want is a sign
suddenly christy hears the toilet flush in the next bathroom
in disbelief no
suddenly christy hears ave maria coming from a radio or tv outside the bathroom
she looks up a ray of sunlight illuminates a grimy dime store christmas tree ornament hanging from a room deodorizer
the ornament is a glittery angel it sparkles in the light
christy leaves the bathroom still not quite sure
christy looks through the grimy window of the gas station office
a bored mechanic is watching a small portable tv
on the tv is an episode of the flying nun sally field in full habit is soaring along
suddenly christy hears the loud roar of a motorcycle starting up over by one of the gas pumps
the biker turns and looks at christy he has long hair and a beard and moustache and he looks well a bit like jesus
oh my god
christy runs up to the biker
im late for church
can i get a lift
christy swings onto the back seat the biker puts his harley in gear and flies down the street
eddie is shocked as he drops some money on the ground and jumps into his car to follow
we see a network truck parked in front of the landmark cathedral
there is a sense of chaos in the chapel as technicians set up television equipment and mother superior leads the choir as it rehearses
near the back of the chapel bishop ohara looks concerned over the performance of the choir
a cardinal walks up to bishop ohara
is this the choir youve been speaking so highly of bishop
theyre just a bit nervous
theyll be fine
the choir seems very demoralized as they finish the hymn
mary patrick is close to tears
we sound terrible we need mary clarence
were losing it
i dont understand
where is she
her whereabouts are unknown and we must proceed without her
pull yourselves together
clapping his hands briskly the floor director suddenly steps forward from behind the tv cameras and hustles the choir away from the altar
okay sisters we have to move on now
that was great just great
charlie throw a spot on the pulpit
lets get a balance
dispirited the choir leaves the altar and walks toward the back of the church
the motorcycle flies through the streets breaking every traffic law on the books
christys robe flaps behind her in the wind and she has a wide smile as she rides
as passersby stare at her she holds out two fingers and blesses them
mary robert stands alone in front of the cathedral wringing her hands with worry
suddenly her face brightens like the dawn as she sees christy ride up
christy and mary robert rush down a side corridor turn a corner and see two tv technicians standing near some cables with the letters of the network embroidered on the
backs of their jackets
christy rushes up to them and taps them on the shoulders
excuse me wheres the rehearsal room
the two technicians turn toward her and she is horrified to see they are
joey and willy
christy gasps as willy sticks a gun in her ribs
joey smiles at her
the rehearsal room is right this way
joey opens a door that leads to an alley behind the cathedral
mary robert looks confused
wait this isnt the way
who are you
theyre from my old convent
christy suddenly lifts her knee into willys groin and he buckles over
she scrambles for the gun but joey beats her to it
christy looks frantically at mary robert
revived willy lunges for mary robert and grabs her
the two men hustle the two struggling nuns out the door to the alley
joey and willy wrestle the two nuns to the open door of their car
they shove christy and mary robert into the back seat and willy climbs in next to them
joey starts the car and it takes off with squealing tires
willy has his gun pointed at christy who sits beside mary robert
but what do they want
where are we going
to joey and willy shes got nothing to do with this
let her go
yeah right to the cops
mary robert dont panic
remember what we talked about
quickly to mary robert you can handle this
the car comes to a stop at an intersection
christy reaches across mary robert and opens the car door
she shoves mary robert into the street
mary robert executes a perfect somersault onto the sidewalk
she looks to heaven crosses herself and runs back to the cathedral
willy grabs christy before she can escape
shes gettin away
we got the one we need
step on it
joey takes off again
eddies car is tied up in traffic but he turns on his blinker lights and peels over to the opposite lane
cars stop to let him through
in the rehearsal room mary robert has just finished telling the nuns what happened to christy
you mean they kidnapped her
yes two men and they had guns
she shouldnt have come back
she knew she was in danger
but why would anyone kidnap a nun
were they catholics
mother superior suddenly steps forward
she isnt a nun
her real name is christy van cartier and she is a professional entertainer
she witnessed a vicious crime and has been hiding in our convent
the nuns all react with shock and emotion
she wasnt a nun
she lied to us
she was such a wonderful nun
look what she did with the choir
she made us sing beautifully
that should have tipped us
well i dont care who she is
we cant sing without her
shes our inspiration
shes the act
reverend mother i know that you and mary clarence didnt always agree but weve got to help her
weve got to save her
we cant leave it up to the feds
the nuns all look to mother superior for an answer
mary robert do you have any idea who those men were
she said they were from her old convent
she was a showgirl
she didnt have an old convent
she told us about one
the little sisters of the moonlight
in las vegas
its a beginning
las vegas nevada
all the nuns hurriedly cross themselves
mary lazarus find the bishop and tell him the situation
everyone else follow me
mother superior leads the way out the door
the driver sits at the wheel of the school bus reading a sleazy novel
he looks up as the nuns all converge on the door
the driver opens the door
the san francisco airport
the nuns are all zooming past the driver onto the bus
to the driver step on it
mary lazarus grabs the drivers sleazy novel confiscating it
the driver starts the engine
as the bus drives off eddies car streaks into the scene and parks in front of the cathedral
eddie rushes into the lobby and sees bishop ohara
where is she
there was a kidnapping
we think las vegas
eddie turns and races back toward the car
several small planes are parked on the tarmac
mother superior and the nuns are arguing with the manager of the airport a grouchy guy in grease stained overalls
fifteen hundred for the run to vegas
but we dont have fifteen hundred
the manager starts back toward his office
cant help you
the voice has a powerful ring of authority to it and the manager looks around
we are nuns
we pray for good things
food for the hungry
peace on earth
however we can also pray for other things
there is a pause as the manager stares at the nuns in horror
lets go to chapel
bring your beads
the nuns begin to leave
a plane sweeps through the desert sky headed for las vegas
through the windows of the plane we see nuns staring out at the glittering city in the distance
packed with gamblers the room is a flurry of activity
joey works his way through the crowd then spots vince near the money cage
we got her
vince follows joey out of the casino with a grim expression
vince and joey enter a storage room that is cluttered with boxes
christy is tied to a chair in the back of the room with willy standing guard over her
christy sits very calmly despite the anger she is in
she seems distinctly nun like in her radiant serenity
turning on the charm babe
christy does not reply
babe what happened here
look at you
good evening vincent
this is me doll
i know you
what did you think you were doing
running to the cops
youre sorry now arent you
i am sorry for all my sins
vince willy and joey all look at each other perplexed
shes a nun vince
kneeling by christy i love you chris
i always will
i gave you so much
a big time career
and how do you repay me
whats the thanks i get
wheres the loyalty huh
wheres the love
you will be judged vincent
we all will
vince stands the charm hasnt worked
hes getting angry
what do you mean judged
i dont get judged baby
and who are you to talk
you were nothing
you couldnt even sing
i must have been out of my mind
shes acting weird vince
ever since we picked her up
its like she aint even afraid or nothing
vince grabs the front of christys habit and squeezes it tightly around her throat
come on tell the boys youre afraid
calmly i feel sorry for you vincent
and i forgive you
this really throws vince and angers him further
he glares at christy and then releases her
he turns to joey and willy
who gives a damn
joey and willy look a little unsure as vince storms out of the room
the nuns are mesmerized by the bright skyline with its colorful flashes of neon
its so beautiful
and what a lovely name
the plane sets down at the vegas airport
mother superior and the nuns climb out
joey and willy find vince near the bar
disturbed whats the problem
shes a nun
are you nuts
shes not a nun
shes a babe
but vince how do you know she didnt like join up and become a nun when she was in that convent
it didnt happen
she was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car
no smart ass remarks or nothing
i cant believe this
okay i want both you guys to go back there and both of you shoot her at the same time
that way wed never know which bullet got to her brain and killed her first
it could always be the other guy
they all look happy with this solution as joey and willy leave
christy still shows no signs of fear as joey and willy take out their guns
okay we got one two three and on three we both shoot
joey points his gun at christys left temple and willy points his gun at her right temple
christy closes her eyes
neither man shoots
they look at each other with anger
christy opens her eyes
you didnt shoot
neither did you
i figured if you were gonna then i wouldnt have to
thats what i figured too
the nuns leave the terminal and stand on the sidewalk out front
las vegas shes here somewhere
there she is
mary patrick is pointing to a group of billboards that feature huge ads for the local hotels and casinos
the center billboard has a splashy picture of a roulette wheel the elvis impersonator and christy and the ronelles
the bottom part of the billboard shows the name of the moonlight casino and lounge
the little sisters of the moonlight
but how do we get there
she strides into the road taxi
once again joey and willy find vince
it didnt work vince
you were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot
we both missed
okay so the problem is still the nun outfit right
so take it off
shocked strip down a nun
you want us to fry
for like twelve zillion eternities
im telling you shes not a nun
get her out of the nun outfit and put her in some clothes
and then we can ice her
no nun no evil eye
joey and willy are very confident about this solution
they strut off pleased with themselves
eddie strides out of the airport he took a later flight than the nuns
a squad car is waiting clarkson beckons him
eddie jumps in the car
clarkson turns on the red bubble light and the siren and the car zooms off
joey and willy return to the storage room looking confident of their mission this time
christy glances up at them as they enter and willy begins to untie her
we got it all worked out
he works the ropes free and christy rubs her wrists to get circulation back again
okay christy strip
that nun thing
take it off
christy suddenly drops to her knees and begins to pray
whats she doing
and god bless joey and willy who are only trying to do their jobs
faking latin pox fibula tibia vobiscum
et marcus dominos pizza
she looks up at the guys im finished now
help me up
as joey and willy bend down to help her up christy suddenly grabs their neckties in each hand
with a fierce jerk she pulls the neckties with all her might smashing joeys head against willys
stunned joey and willy stagger backward holding their heads
christy scrambles out the door while the two men groan in pain
joey and willy burst out of the room with guns drawn
at the far end of the corridor they spot a glimpse of black clothing as christy starts down the stairs
there she goes
shes taking the stairs they run quickly after her
christy runs down the stairs as a shot rings out
christy screams and runs even faster
a door swings open into the casino and christy appears looking frantic
a muffled shot is heard behind her and she sprints into the casino
seconds later joey and willy appear
find vince and tell him what happened
ill take this side of the room
willy hurries away to find vince and joey starts searching the crowd
three cabs roar up in front of the building and nuns tumble out
the nuns enter the casino and stop dead in their tracks
before them is a large room filled with glitter and sin the sound of jackpots and crap tables
brace yourselves sisters
in unison the nuns all cross themselves
spread out and look for mary clarence
try to blend in
the nuns spread to every part of the room looking for christy
a blackjack table a game is in progress with several players
mary patrick rushes up to the table
excuse me has anyone seen a nun
the croupier and the players stare at the two nuns
christy is making her way past a roulette table
suddenly she sees joey coming toward her making his way through the crowd
christy grabs the arm of a salesman playing roulette
place your bets
to the salesman red
how do you know
christy looks up to heaven
to the croupier red
joey stands at the opposite side of the roulette table glaring at christy
the crowd around the table watches christy for a moment then they all put their chips down on red
joey starts working his way around the table toward christy as the croupier spins the wheel
the ball falls into a slot
everyone at the table turns toward christy outraged
she gives them a reprimanding look
did you learn something
christy suddenly realizes that joey is almost at her side
she shoves the salesman against him and runs away
we see two long rows of slot machines with gamblers working every machine
willy appears at one end of the row scanning the area for christy
he sees a nun crossing at the far end of the row and she moves out of sight
willy heads in that direction
someone hits a jackpot behind him and he turns toward the sound
as he does
he sees another nun crossing at the opposite end of the row of machines
willy turns again now he sees three nuns crossing at the opposite end
he looks confused and doesnt know which way to turn
eddie drives up in the squad car and parks near the back door
to clarkson close off the block but dont move in till i tell you
eddie jumps out of the car and hurries inside
as christy moves past a blackjack game she suddenly sees vince moving toward her
turning quickly she moves away from vince but suddenly sees joey coming toward her from the opposite direction
trapped for a moment she has panic in her eyes
suddenly she is flanked by mother superior and mary patrick
what are you doing here
the nuns surround christy and head through the crowd in a cluster
joey and vince pursue them from different directions
just before they catch them mother superior barks an order
the nuns split up each taking a different direction
vince and joey look bewildered
vince joey and willy each pick a nun and follow her
vince catches up to a nun whom we only see from the rear
he grabs her shoulder
the nun spins around it is mother superior
vince releases her and frantically searches the crowd again
joey catches up with his nun only to find it is mary patrick
the shell game has worked christy has escaped for the moment
we find eddie scanning the floor and seeing nuns spread out everywhere
he talks quietly into his walkie talkie
seal off the exits but dont come inside till i tell you
vince joey and willy run into each other in the center of the casino
theres nuns everywhere
hundreds of em
all the nuns suddenly come together and see that the exits are blocked by vince and his hoods
vince spots christy in the center of the group
there she is
christy sees vince pointing at her
quick theres another way out of here
christy runs toward a set of glass doors set off to one side
the other nuns follow her
shes heading for the lounge
vince joey and willy head for the lounge
across the room eddie sees christy and the cluster of nuns head through the glass doors
he barks into his walkie talkie
move in now
the lounge is deserted between shows and all the lights are out
the mobsters enter with guns drawn
i cant see anything in here
willy hit the lights
willy moves off to find the light switch
there is a flash of black and white fabric behind some chairs
before he can shoot there is another flash of fabric on the opposite side of the room
aiming no there
and a third flash of fabric near the stage
willy has found the lights and the lounge is suddenly brightly lit
the mobsters blink for a moment then find all the nuns bunched together in a corner trying to find an exit
the nuns turn and face the mobsters shielding christy
where is she
christy steps forward to the front of the stage
let the others go they have nothing to do with this
joey do it
but boss shes still you know a nun
shes a broad
just some broad
mother superior steps forward
with authority i guarantee you she is no broad
she is sister mary clarence of st
she is a model of generosity virtue and love
you have my word gentlemen
she is a nun
now arent you glad we didnt shoot her
vince has had enough
facing christy he raises the gun and points it right between christys eyes only inches away
the nuns all recoil with horror
the gun goes off but christy isnt hit
she blinks her eyes open shocked to be alive
instead its vince who falls crumpling to the floor and clutching his shoulder
across the room eddie holds a smoking police revolver
the nuns all swarm around christy joyously
mary clarence youre alive
also smiling van cartier
christy breaks away from the jubilant nuns
she faces mother superior
reverend mother thank you
you saved my life
im a christian
police pour into the room and gather up joey willy and vince
eddie walks over to christy and mother superior
dont you have a concert to go to
sisters you dont know this but reverend mothers been making all sorts of noises about resigning
thats bad news
i dont know if we could sing if we thought that was true
not a note
mary lazarus coughs and points to her throat as if she has laryngitis
all the other nuns imitate her
to mother superior then i guess youre stuck
she turns to eddie i hold you responsible for all of this for introducing a lounge act into my convent
for utterly disrupting our way of life
and for placing all of us in mortal danger
sincerely with a smile thank you
angle on christy watching this
yeah eddie thanks a whole bunch
thanks for sticking me in a convent
so you think after all this maybe i really am a nun
i dont know
theres only one way to be absolutely sure
yeah like what
eddie takes christy in his arms and they begin a kiss
as they do so vince struggles toward christy as two cops hold him back
he is furious
i was good to you
you re nothing but no talent garbage
youre a two bit tramp
staring at vince seeing him for the scum that he is that used to be true vince
i was with you
but something happened
and im different now
ive had well you might call it a religious experience
and ive got just two words for you
and those two words are
afraid christy will curse mary clarence
grinning to vince bless you
people are pouring into the cathedral
among them we see many cardinals in their red uniforms
the choir has gathered together in a small room off the main chapel
they are putting finishing touches on their choral robes and are waiting nervously to go on
to christy i just realized this is the last time well all be together
were going to miss you so much
christy and mary patrick embrace
mary patrick is tearful
hey you re supposed to be the cheerful one
why do i suddenly feel like snow white
to christy with humor you re okay for a civilian
christy and mary lazarus embrace
since mary clarence came to st
katherines ive been shot at kidnapped by mafia hit men and ive tasted beer
is that enough experience yet
for final vows
i dont think so
what about skydiving
a crank call to billy graham
you have evidenced great maturity mary robert
we shall have a serious discussion
what about me reverend mother
i think you were right
im just a bad influence
sister show biz
perhaps we can all use
a little spandex
and maybe shorter habits and women priests and sleeping late
dont push it
christy and mother superior embrace
the chapel is packed to the rafters
the first few rows of pews are occupied by cardinals
television cameras glide up and down the aisles angling for shots of the altar
the choir stands together on the altar with christy in front
behind them stands a much larger all city choir
christy gives the nod to sister alma and the organ vamp begins
dont you know it
what did he say
its true i know her
what a shame
were you wicked
were you tempted
in the front row mother superior is trying to resist the music
she gives in and starts bobbing her head to the beat
beside her eddie looks very proud as his eyes meet christys
but im fearful
and im tearful
the entire congregation is ecstatic as the song concludes with a glorious final flourish
