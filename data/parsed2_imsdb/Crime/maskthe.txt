written by mark verheiden the dragonhead prow of an ancient viking ship cuts through the thick fog of the rough north atlantic sea
music explodes wagners gotterdammerung twilight of the gods viking explorer leif ericson carefully studies his fob compass as he dangles it above a parchment map
his sailors steal nervous looks at a large diabolical looking iron box in the hold
olaf a fierce one eyed viking warrior approaches ericson
note dialog is in old norse with subtitles leif lets do the deed before another night falls
the crews near mutiny
ericson draws his broadsword with a flourish
the first man to turn will taste my steel in his guts
but weve surely gone far enough
that accursed box must be thrown off the edge of the world
we will go until we can go no more
suddenly there is an ear splitting screech and the entire boat rocks violently as it runs aground
the lookout is thrown from his crows nest
and crashes straight through the deck right in front of ericson
his pained voice floats up from the black hole
ericson wheels about just as the fog parts off the starboard bow
a beautiful rustic coastline stretching off as far as the eye can see
by odins beard
olaf finishes digging a hole in the sand
he backs away terrified as burly vikings led by ericson muscle the iron box over to the hole and quickly bury it
ericson turns to an exotic looking eurasian be quick witch
let the deed be done
the witch unravels a scroll and recites oh loki ancient one
thy mischief dwell now in waters base and bland
and in waves and sand thy magic forever sleep
as the witch speaks a strong wind kicks up and a black wall of clouds appears
the sky explodes in thunder and lightning
the look about fearfully
back to the ship men hurry
captain youve discovered a new world
it is your right to name it
leave that to the italians
were never coming back here
this land is now cursed
hot smoggy and packed
cityscape of towering skyscrapers stands in the haze just beyond the crowded beach
a caffeine driven d
js voice booms over the beach goers radios
yessiree its a four alarm sizzler out there today with highs in the upper nineties and no relief in sight
we have a third stage smog advisory and a metro traffic gridlock alert
flourocarbons are up the dow jones is down and were expecting another spike lee movie any second
in other words folks its just another bee youtiful day in edge city
camera endframes on an industrial barge marked department of sanitation
a cranes cable line disappears underwater
scuba welders repair a cracked scum spewing pipe
one diver hits something hard with his dredger
rust and barnacles partially obscure the engraved images of norse gods and demons
the diver wedges his scuba knife under the corroded lock
erie mask theme sfx rise as he tries to pry open the lid
suddenly the pipeline breaks free crushing the diver and cracking open the box
something seen only in rippling shadow explodes out of the box on a cloud of bubbles and shoots toward the surface
the mask surfaces in the f
as lightening explodes across the distant cityscape
a banner displays their proud motto we bank on tomorrow
charlie schumacher s gazes out the window from his cluttered desk as the crack of thunder echos through the urban canyons
look at those clouds rollin in man
stanley ipkiss a bright eyed amiable young account exec pauses by charlies desk and drops off a print out
hey charlie can you go over these stats

so maybe i am a nice guy
you are a rug
i am talking astro turf here
youre letting these women sharpen their cleats on you

were dealing with an entire generation of dysfunctional love junkies
you cant romance em
you gotta confuse em
its the only thing that gets their attention
let me demonstrate
you see that girl over there
stanley looks over at the coffee service where an attractive young woman is pouring herself a cup of coffee
forgets his name oh hi
lisa this may seem a little odd but my friend over there and i were having this discusion and i thought maybe you could settle it for us
ill help out if i can

just for the sake of argument if i wasnt a happily married man
am i the kind of guy youd go out with
i dont know
i guess i would
lisa i have terrific news for you
im not married
is this perfect or what
listen theres not a lot of women willing to come right out like that and admit theyre attracted to a guy but
lisa slaps charlie turns on her heel and marches off
make up your mind
stanley gives charlie the fish eye as he returns
some of these women got so much baggage they need an emotional sky cap
ill tell you what stanley tonight im gonna take you on a love safari deep into the darkest heart of the urban jungle
and wheres that
the monkeys paw
hottest new club in town
its a guaranteed skirt alert and no dead beats allowed
so how are we gonna get in
woah do i detect a little self image problem there buddy
you just leave everything to me
this my friend is going to be the perfect night on the town
suddenly a resounding peal of thunder rings out like the crack of doom
sheets of rain pour down on the banks windows
pedestrians scramble for cover in the sudden downpour
a young woman scurries into the bank holding a newspaper over her head
shes soaking wet and pauses in the foyer to straighten herself out
charlie immediately notices her
hold the phone
killer at three oclock
stanley follows his gaze
camera does a classic cheesecake tilt up starting with the womans million dollar legs as she squeezes some of the water out of her skirt
up past her body which through her damp summer clothes is undeniable proof that there is a god
to her face as that newspaper is tossed aside
shes a heart stopping woman child with a cupids bow mouth and ice blue eyes
in other words shes trouble
big trouble also known as tina carlyle
charlie may as well have just seen the virgin of guadalupe
hushed reverence oh my god
a perfect dime
the dame of dames
the moby of my dick
youll sprain your eyes
tina now enters and walks towards stanley and charlie
excuse me where can i open a new account
charlie flashes his best watt smile
youve come to the right place maam
just step right this way and pull up a chair
charlie tries to steer tina to his desk but shes still preoccupied with her damp clothing
oh im sorry
im a complete wreck
will you hold this please
she hands her shoulder bag to stanley and peels off her wet blazer creating another awe inspiring visual moment
here let me take that for you
charlie clutches her jacket with white knuckles
but tina turns and sits at stanleys desk charlie is stunned at his near miss but theres not a thing he can do about it
so uh what kind of account did you have in mind
smiles sweetly well im not sure exactly
im just terrible with things like that
thats an interesting tie mr
tina extends her hand
pleased to meet you
pleasures all mine
tina notices a box of kleenex on stanleys desk
im such a mess
tina takes out a compact and daintily blots the moisture from her face
as i was saying about that tie
its like one of those what do you call them ink blot tests
a rorschach test
she twists open a tube of lip gloss andbegins to run it across her incredibly lush liips
it looks like
a young woman riding bareback
you know like a lady godiva or something
i dont think i can
she slowly runs a finger along stanleys tie
if thats not a horse it could be two lovers
a man and a woman
that would be the woman on top of course
she licks her lips and blots them on the kleenex leaving a perfect kiss impression and drops it on stanleys desk
what do you see mr
stanley starts to get uncomfortable under her gaze
i dont know
its a power tie yknow
theyre supposed to make you feel
does it work
its just a tie
now about that account
as tina drops her compact back in her shoulder bag and we see her flick a red l
she carefully adjusts the bag aiming a tiny camera lens neatly concealed within it
tinas pointing the bag at the open bank vault that stands a short distance from stanleys desk
displaying the shot of the vault that tina is broadcasting
dorian tyrel a slick nouveau mobster complete with diamond ear stud and matsuda jacket watches the video broadcast from his sanctum an eclectic post modern playroom with an array of
electronic toys and minimalist gun racks
dorian sips nervously on a yoo hoo as he watches the show
thats it sweetheart
a little to the right
his two gunsels sweet eddy and chun woo are busy at the back of the room playing air hockey
serious firepower is visible in shoulder holsters
hey will you guys keep it down back there
dorians safe cracking expert a black hip hop artist named doctor freeze scribbles notes as he watches the screen with a practiced eye
thats cool man

dorian punches a button and the image freezes
what do you think doctor

take a look
dorian pulls back a curtain
an amazingly gaudy building stands on a pier across the river from dorians club
a huge sign across its archway reads opening soon valhalla casino
the valhalla casino
twenty mil of glass neon booze and dice
world class sucker bait
the grand opening is saturday night and it will drive this two bit club of mine out of existence
but i say if you cant beat em take em over
thats arnie the swedes place man and he is one ice cold meatball eatin motha fucker

the mask lies tangled in a rats nest of seaweed and garbage thats washed up in a culvert under a bridge
a large wharf rat now creeps out along the garbage sniffing curiously at its timeworn wooden surface
it takes a tentative nibble
begins to shimmer
to vibrate with its own magical inner life
the rat squeaks and jumps back disturbing the pile of garbage
the mask is dislodged and floats back out into the river
camera tilts up with the mask as it follows the current into the dark heart of the city
stanley and charlie are riding along at breakneck speed in a taxi cab
hold it up right here please
a gun port suddenly slams open and the wild eyed albanian taxi driver wheels about and cocks a huge
from his side of the riddled partition as the cab continues to barrel through traffic
no hold up
i keel you very well
i splatter your guts big time mr
stanley dives for cover
he only wants you to stop the cab
the driver instantly slams on the brakes throwing his passengers forward mercilessly
now totally calm hokay
pardon you very much
charlie helps stanley sit back up
its alright stanley
i hate this town
i really hate this town
why are you getting out here
i gotta pick up my car
now dont forget
ten oclock at the monkeys paw
ive already got us lined up with a couple of authentic dimes
stanley steps out of the cab
the last time you said that you showed up with two lesbian mud wrestlers
well i cant promise well get that lucky again
with a scream of tires the cab peels back out into traffic
stanley enters the grease spattered cluttered garage and scans the area for signs of life
we can hear the clank clank crash of less than light fingered automotive work in progress
stanley dings a little service bell sitting on a counter plastered with naked playmate decoupage and mrs
power tool calendars
irv a lumbering unshaven behemoth of a man with permanently low slung refrigerator repairman pants makes his way past half rebuilt car carcasses towards stanley
dont get your panties in a twist
burt a thinner version of irv with coke bottle glasses and a mop of greasy hair pops up from beneath a car rips out of chunk of motor and wiring
and holds it up to irv
examining part hey irv what the hell is this
eyes it carefully ohh
about seven hundred bucks
they both laugh evilly as irv slaps burt on the back
irv makes his way over to stanley still chuckling to himself
now what can i do for you bub
im here for the civic
japanese car right
kind of a nasty pea soup green
well they call it emeral forest actually
irv turns back to burt
pea green civic
burt pops back up from beneath the hood
brake drums are still on order and im only halfway through rebuilding the trans
but i just brought it in for an oil change
well youre lucky we caught those other problems before they caused some serious trouble
when will it be ready
irv looks over at burt who gives him a make something up look
come back tomorro
burt shakes his head no
first thing next wee
burt shakes again next month
burt shakes an enthusiastic yes
yeah first thing next month
thats if we can get the parts
what am i going to do in the meantime
i cant afford to keep taking cabs all over town
irv smiles a rotten toothed smile
we can take care of that
to burt archly hey burt bring around the loaner
to stanley and for you little buddy only ten bucks a day
the joint is jumping with musclehead bouncers picking and choosing from the crowd of terminally trendy wannabes gathered around the entrance
a light drizzle is falling
a parade of swanky cars pulls up one by one as car hops scurry to keep up with the flow a glistening pearlescent rolls royce
a fire engine red ferrari
a classic two tone corniche in tan and burgundy
and finally a broken down citroen in rust bucket red and spackle gray rumbles up to the front of the club with a disgruntled stanley behind the wheel
a car hop attempts to open the door but its rusted shut
stanley throws his shoulder into it and the door finally pops open with a screech of metal
stanley nearly tumbles out into the street
he smiles nervously at a high class couple looking with disdain at the eyesore mobile
he pats the hood
its a classic
the car hop jumps in and tries to throw the car into gear with a horrible grinding
he finally waves over two other car hops who quickly push it off down the street
what is that a rolls canardley
you know a rolls canardley
rolls down one hill canardley roll up the next
he cracks up we are not discussing the car okay
whatever you say man
charlie gestures expansively towards the club
what do you think
pretty terrific huh
this place make sodom and gomorrah look like mayberry
stanley now notices a life sized poster of tina carlyle standing by the main entrance that reads featuring the musical stylings of miss tina carlyle
hey isnt that
the wet dream from the bank
i think i see my future ex wife
two rather tacky looking girls beckon charlie from the crowd
were in luck
its barbie and pebbles
doesnt it bother you that all the women you know are named after cartoon characters
barbie and pebbles hurry over through the crowd
weve been waiting out here for hours
can you get us in
ladies this is my pal stanley ipkiss
leans closer stanleys very influential in the banking business
charlie is truly in his element as he elbows his way through the crowd dragging his entourage with him
charlie finally makes through the crush of badies at the entry ways velvet ropes and calls to one of the two hulking bouncers that guard the door
whats happening man
bobby completely ignores charlie as he ushers a pasty faced rock star and his underage tartlet past the ropes
to the girls this will just take a second
to the other bouncer yo nick
nick is also completely oblivious
forget it charlie
i refuse to stand here waiting to be judged by these power mad steroid jockeys
how much cash you got on you
you heard me
how much you got
i dunno fifty or sixty bucks
hand it over
hey ill pay you back
im only carrying plastic
cmon man you want to stand out here all night
stanley begrudgingly starts to count out some cash
charlie snatches the whole wad and elbows his way back around to the ropes
subtly flashing bills hey bobby
bobbys uncanny tip radar suddenly lights up
charlie how you doin man
long time no see
bobby unsnaps the rope for charlie and gets the cash handshake he longs for
the crowd surges around charlie barbie and pebbles as they step by briefly cutting stanley off
he catches up just as the all important rope is snapped closed
hey wait a minute
but charlie and the girls have already been whisked inside
dorian now steps out of the club and begins to check bobbys list
im with them
but bobby is back into his deaf and dumb routine
stanley unsnaps the rope himself and starts throgh
bobby and bouncer grab stanley and quickly subdue him
dorian glares at stanley
the bouncers drag stanley through the crowd and unceremoniously toss him out into the rain slick street
stanley slowly rises smoothing out his disheveled clothing
a horn blares and stanley scrambles to one side as a limo swings into the clubs alleyway splattering him with a wave of muddy water
stanley wipes the mud from his eyes just in time to see tina carlyle escorted from the back of the limo by a chauffeur carrying an umbrella
shes shoe horned into a heart stopping red dress thats fighting a losing battle to restrain her decolletage
their eyes meet
tina pauses as she recognizes him
stanley realizes he looks ridiculous but gives a pathetic little wave hello anyway
are you okay
stanley gestures no problem and tries to strike a casual pose against a street lamp but slips and nearly falls
with a squeal of grinding gears and the ka pow of a backfire the car hop pulls stanleys battered loaner right up behind him
stanley flashes a last nervous smile at tina and digs for the car hops tip money
he shrugs apologetically to the disgusted car hop and climbs in
the car rattles coughs the finally roars off in a cloud of exhaust fumes
a forlorn looking spot on the outskirts of edge city
we can hear stanleys car sputtering and popping along before it actually pulls into sight on the dark rain slick street
stanley drives along in a miserable daze
suddenly the engine starts knocking violently and the car dies
steam hisses from the radiator as the car slowly rolls to a stop
stanley grinds the ignition key again and again trying futilely to restart the engine
finally stanley fights his way out of the rusted door with a squeal of metal turns and kicks the bumper
which promptly falls off with a resounding clunk
the front axle collapses the tires fall off and the drivers side door clatters to the ground
stanley stands there staring at the steaming heap of useless metal
his mind a complete blank
he slowly turns looking down at the black brackish water swirling along beneath the tahoochie bridge
a wave of melancholy sweeps over him
stanley plucks a button from his coat and watches as it drops down
down to the river below
suddenly something catches stanleys eye
a body floating along in the darkness
he snaps back to reality
stanley rushes down the slippery embankment beneath the bridge
he spots the body dead ahead floating along in the moonlight and as fast as he can
camera dollies with stanley as he scrambles down the slope a black cat yowls as it races past him
he steps on and shatters a discarded mirror and he ducks under an old ladder that leans against the bridges foundation as he finally reaches the shore
stanley splashes into the waist deep water just in time to catch the body as it floats by
as stanley grabs it the body falls to pieces
revealing that its nothing but a trash bag an old tire and some floating bits of garbage all clinging to the head an old wooden mask
stanley shakes his head in disgust
stanley inspects the mask more closely strange ritualistic symbols carved into a puckish face with a leering grin and eerie empty eye holes
the faintest sound of a haunting mask sfx theme rises as stanley turns the mask around and inspects the inside
slowly bringing it closer and closer to his face
the surface of the mask begins to but then
a frog jumps out of it right into stanleys face
stanley nearly loses his footing on the slippery river bottom
suddenly a blinding spotlight shines down from the bridge and an amplified voice calls out from a squad car
what are you doing down there
stanley squints into the light trying to think of a reasonable answer
i was just looking for
holds up mask my mask
the club is closing up
waiters stack chairs on top of tables in the b
as tina gathers her sheet music from her pianist
thanks reno youre the greatest
tina crosses to the bar area where dorian lounges with dr
freeze sweet eddy and chun woo
dorian toasts her as she pulls up a bar stool
that was a great performance baby
but not as great as the one you pulled off at the bank
yeah well dont get used to it
im not going to start running cons for you again dorian
im a singer now and thats it
dorian rolls his eyes at freeze get her
and you had such a red hot career before you latched on to me
tina pours herself a drink
who latched on to who
get real tina
youll do what i say or ill drop you back where i found you slingin hash and dodgin horny peterbuilt drivers
downs a shot dont push me nicky
i might just take a walk i should have taken a long time ago
to his men i love it when she gets pissed
dorian scoots over and puts an arm around tina
she remains cool
you take a hike and whos gonna kiss you like dorian tyrel
tina pours another shot
tina finally cracks a smile
pulls her close thats right baby
tina slowly leans in for a kiss her lips softly parted
but raises a finger to dorians lips stopping him cold
she glances over at freeze
i never get personal in front of the help
tina abruptly stands and exits as freeze glares at her
dorian breaks into laughter
that broad kills me
she just might man
the bitch is trouble
dorian pours them all a drink
cmon doctor lighten up
raises his glass heres to edge city bank
may it crack like an egg on easter sunday
their glasses clink
the police car pulls up in front of stanleys brownstone and he wearily climbs out
try to be a little more careful next time
the black and white pulls away and stanley starts across the empty street
a razor cut deaths head punker hops down from a fire escape in a darkened alleyway
you a cop or something
a half dozen other deaths heads appear out of the shadows all decked out in nipple chains tattoos and other self mutilation oddments
they just gave me a lift
a cop chauffeur
i never seen that before
how about you boys
the other deaths heads pipe up with not me nope pretty special etc
as they slowly surround stanley
alright you guys
its been a tough night
i havent got any money
i havent got a car
all i have is this and youre welcome to it
stanley tosses deaths head the mask
he briefly inspects the funky looking antique still slick with river slime then tosses it back
he approaches stanley
you got us all wrong
we dont want any trouble
i was just going to ask you for the time
you got the time
as stanley pulls back his sleeve to check his watch the deaths head flicks out a butterfly knife
with a flash of steel he slices straight through stanleys watch band and snatches the watch
holding up his prize see i only wanted the time
heh he heh
all the punkers laugh like the half wits they are as deaths head shoves stanley into deaths head
pushes him back across to and so on
stanley is roughly bounced back and forth more and more violently within the circle of giggling street toughs
he finally breaks free and scrambles to his front door still reeling with dizziness
he fumbles with the key and slams the door behind him as the deaths heads roar with laughter
stanleys wet shoes squeak as he tiptoes past a sign that reads quiet please hangs from the doorknob
stanley continues past it to apartment b
just as he removes his keys managers door flies open and mrs
shes an old dragon in hair curlers who will probably live forever just to spite her relatives
do you have any idea what time it is
reflexively he looks at his now empty wrist
its three oclock in the morning
first you wake up the entire building laughing it up with your pals
then you come in and start squeak sees puddles my new carpet
just look at that
this is coming out of your cleaning deposit ipkiss
stanley battered bruised and soaking wet is deep in urban shell shock
are you done
i think ill be going to bed now
peenman slams her door
small full of books but very neat
a few cherished animation cels from s cartoons are framed on the wall
as stanley locks the door behind him hes greeted by milo a happy little terrie sized mutt with a big heart
milo gets so excited he starts gagging and coughing
i missed you too
stanley pats milo on the rump crosses his tiny kitchenette and heads straight into
stanleys prized collection of golden age looney tunes tapes are neatly displayed on a simple bookshelf
he tosses the mask down on his bedside table pops one of his cherished tex avery cartoons into the v
plops down on his bed and starts to strip off his shoes and socks
enters holding a frisbee in his mouth
to the dog yips okay okay
stanley tosses the frisbee into the air
the disk sails
milo runs it down leaps up and makes a perfect catch
he trots back to the bedroom and drops it in stanleys lap
this is the best part
on the screen a cartoon dog zzzips into frame and drops a frizzing stick of dynamite down a bad guys pants
the dog laughs maniacally
suddenly there is a pounding on the wall that rattles stanleys framed cartoon cels
calls out sorry mrs
with a sigh he ejects the tape and a much quieter talk show pops on
larry king and a guest
stanley rises and crosses into the bathroom to wash up
kings guest dr
arthur neuman is replying to a caller
the truth is we all wear masks metaphorically speaking
we repress the id
our darkest desires and hide behind a more socially acceptable image of ourselves in order to cope with the frustrations of our day to day lives
stanleys only half listening though the open bathroom door as he brushes his teeth
think im repressed milo
stanley tries a couple of fierce expressions in the bathroom mirror his mouth foaming with toothpaste
milo does that doggie head cocked sideways what the hell
he spits and rinses
as king wraps it up displaying the doctors book
the book is the masks we wear by dr
thank you dr
stanley pops off the t
with his remote
no thank you dr
as he buttons up his p
s stanley notices milo warily sniffing at the strange mask which is still lying on the bedside table
a shimmer crosses its surface
milo whimpers and quickly hops off the bed
we now begin to hear the mask theme
echoes of the pounding viking drums
haunting whispery voices seem to call to stanley as he slowly crosses to the bedside
he picks up the mask and turns it over in his hands running his fingers across the time work wood
the music builds
he turns back to the bathroom mirror and slowly raises the mask to his face
milo watches apprehensively from beneath the bed
for an instant the mask shrink wraps like a vacuum over stanleys head
we hear the piercing mask sfx
then a beat later the mask is off with a pop
the sfx stop
stanley studies the old mask then his own face in the mirror
everythings status quo
it must have been his imagination
he puts the mask on again firmly this time
milo dives under the bed as
rubbery wooden whips shoot out of the mask and wrap around stanleys head locking the mask in place
stanleys pajamas magically reweave themselves
growing in all directions
his head throbs and expands turning lime green as it unites with the mask
stanley grabs his head his body begins to move uncontrollably
spinning faster and faster like a gyroscope
the sfx get loonier and loonier as he becomes
a human tornado
stanleys words are almost unintelligible as his voice jumps one two five octaves
a hand reaches out of the twister and locks onto the bedpost
the whirlwind screeches to a halt causing sparks and smoke to rise the singed carpet
the smoke clears revealing
hes dressed in a snazzy zoot suit a distortion of the paisley material of stanleys pajamas
the head is no longer stanleys
its large bald and bright green
the huge bug eyes glow with mischief
the nose is small bony and beaked
the mouth and teeth are enormous and gleaming white as he breaks into a learning grin
the overall effect is devilishly loony but not altogether unhuman
in fact theres something downright charming about him
the mask checks himself out in the mirror and likes what he sees
s s s nazzy
he snaps his bow tie with a crazy gleam in his eyes
its party time
trying to ber very very quiet the mask tiptoes down the darkened corridor
the floor makes a barely audible creeeek as the mask steps with exaggerated care pst apartment a with its little quiet please sign
he raises a finger to his lip making the shush sign
suddenly and unexplicably a ringing alarm clock leaps out of stanley masks pocket and starts jittering down the hall
stanley mask tries to snag the clock but it bounces away every time
frustrated he pulls a full sized sledgehammer from his pocket and starts pounding the floor in an effort to stop the clock
glancing blows shatter the clock face and most of the works but those bells just keep ringing
the hammer of course slams craters the size of manhole covers into the floor and reverberates through the building like the door bursts open and mrs
peenmans angry face pops out covered in blue mud pack and framed in curlers
she gets one look at the mask with his oversized carnival mallet raised over his head and screams bloody murder
the mask screams in response his eyes bugging out on stalks and his mouth expanding to the size of a tuba in mock horror
peenmans door slams shut and reopens a beat later as she appears cocking an enormous shotgun
i was just killin time
the mask starts ricocheting off the walls hooting maniacal laughter as mrs
peenman lets loose with both barrels
the mask bounces off walls as mrs
peenman continues to blast away and finally leaps straight out the window
sending his body sailing our through the air towards the street seven stories below
stanley mask lands face up in the middle of the street
painfully starts to rise as a street cleaning machine turns a corner and runs directly over him
the machine disappears down the street as we hold on stanley masks flattened body
he raises one arm grabs himself by the head and peels himself off the street
he shakes himself out with one sharp crack and straightens his zoot suit
hes shocked to find a tiny spot on his sleeve
you missed a spot
as if on cue a second street cleaning machine slams into him and runs over him again
this time he reinflates himself back into by blowing into his thumb and hops up
and next time no starch
fully recovered stanley mask starts down the street strutting like a prize fighter
deaths head punker hops down from his fire esscape behind the mask
grins evilly you got the time
the mask turns to see he is surrounded by the deaths head punkers
he seems to be delighted by their presence but now that they see his face theyre totally freaked
wiggles eyebrows why of course cubbie
i got all the time in the world
he whips out his forearm which grows large for emphasis cartoon style
its covered with crazily spinning watches chiming cuckoo clocks and sun dials
london paris rome standard substandard and no standards at all
and for our english friends we have
stanley mask kicks a nearby street post snapping it in half and sending a large decorative street clock plummeting into the sidewalk
it completely obliterates deaths head
the other gang members jump back in shock as the mask races around the corner
the deaths heads pull out nasty homemade weapons and race around the corner into the alleyway
they come to a screeching halt as they discover stanley mask dressed as a carnival barker
multicolored lights and calliope music come from out of nowhere
and for my next trick
long pink and blue balloons appear in stanley masks hands and he instantly goes into a frenzy of twisting and knotting them into elaborate balloon sculpture
the deaths heads are too stunned by the severe weirdness of all this to do anything but stand there and stare
these guys were no rocket scientists in the first place
we have a giraffe
sure enough hes created a first rate balloon sculpture
he hands it to the biggest dumbest deaths head who grins like a little kid upon receiving it
the mask instantly goes into another flurry of motion sculpting more balloons
a few more twists of the wrist and for you cubbie
he hands this next prize to deaths head
a french poodle
and finally my favorite
he goes into another flurry of motion
as the mask pulls the ends of the knotted balloon it straightens out and morphs into
a tommy gun
a real one
he immediately sprays the deaths heads with hot lead
the greasy punkers dive for cover and scramble out of the alley under a hail of bullets
stanley mask tosses the gun aside intoxicated with his newfound powers
wait a minute
this is incredible
why with these powers i could be a superhero
i could fight crime
work for world peace
its late but theres still a light on inside
burt and irv both woozy from drink attempt to finish a card game
a dozen empty beer bottles and two half eaten chili dogs adorn the table
irv takes a big bite of his chili dog and pauses to regard it like a true connoisseur
now these are serious chili dogs
heres the proof
lets out a long buuurp aaah
even tastier the second time around
irv leans forward and sticks out his index finger
hey burt pull on my finger
no way man
irv raises a leg anyway and rips off a nasty fart
that my friend is the sweet smell of success
i give it a five tops
okay how about
irv shifts his weight and hits an amazing high note
burt is impressed in spite of himself
fine muscle control
and now for my grand finale thx
the audience is listening
irv lets one loose in perfect sensurround
suddenly the front door explodes inward
stanley mask stands there silhouetted like a gunfighter from a clint eastwood movie
irv squints into the light unable to make out the mysterious figure
but youre here
what i mean is
he lets loose a sneaker to help make his point
nobodys here that wants to help you
stanley mask now steps into the light
but im here to help you
burt and irvs eyes go wide as they get a better look at their nemesis
fear loosens irvs sphincter and a last feeble bit of gas escapes with a stanley mask whirls about with a flourish and pulls two gleaming mufflers from the wall
sounds like you have a little exhaust problem there
theres a mad gleam in his eyes as he spins the mufflers like two huge pistols and snaps them to a halt
we better do a few touch ups before you have some serious trouble
the mask twirls out of frame like a human tornado
camera pushes in past burt and irvs shocked expressions into an e
of the garages bare light bulb as it jiggles on its wire
we cant see the mayhem but we can hear wacky bizarre sound f
as the mask whirls about the garage
as that light bulb becomes the morning sun peaking over edge citys skyline
camera pulls back through stanleys bedroom window
stanley slowly awakens
he grabs his head and moans looking and feeling completely hung over
then suddenly he remembers and out of bed with a start
he looks in the mirror touching his face
its the same old stanley
he looks at his paisley pjs
same old pjs
he picks up the mask
same old mask
it was only a dream
stanley starts to relax
theres a knock at the door
stanleys greeted by lt
this hound dog of a cop cant help but stare at stanleys garish pajamas
nice pjs pal
can i help you
some kind of prowler broke in and attacked mrs
swallows hard really
i didnt hear a thing
then you must be a pretty sound sleeper ipkiss cause she unloaded a couple rounds of ott buckshot five feet from your door
kellaway swings stanleys door open wider to give him a better view of the damage
peenman stands there in the hall tearfully speaking to anither officer
stanley is flabbergasted to see c
the shotgun blasts in the walls
the pot holes left from the mallet
the shattered remains of the wacky alarm clock
all flashbacks from last night
stanley quickly pulls himself together
see i have this inner ear problem
wiggles a finger in his ear vigorously sometimes i cant hear a thing
is that a fact
kellaway leans closer to speak more loudly but catches himself and shoots stanley a dirty look
he hands stanley his card
you remember anything unusual about last night anything at all call me
stanley slams the door and throws his body against it his heart pounding in his chest
milo gives him that curious dog head cocked sideways look
milo it was real
how could it all be
stanley suddenly notices the clock on the wall
oh my god
he races into the bedroom
kellaway is taking notes as patiently as he can from mrs
peenman you gotta admit your description is pretty tough to swallow
then you can choke on it for all i care
i saw what i saw
refers to notes a green head the size of a pumpkin purple zoot suit and spats
thats a pretty serious fashion risk for any self respecting second story man
an officer now hurries up the steps all out of breath
we just got an emergency call from a mechanic on th street
some kind of assault and battery
sound pretty bad
dont worry mrs
peenman well find this guy for you
officer deluca here has a few forms youll have to fill out
stanley rushes around the apartment but he cant find his keys anywhere
he finishes tying his tie as he searches
milos ears prick
he leaps up and immediately starts sniffing around
he pulls a cushion off the sofa and emerges with the keys just as stanley comes out briefcaase in hand
he pets his dog takes his keys and starts out the door
but he pauses to take a last look at the mask
its eerie black eye holes and devilish grin seem to mock him
on sudden impulse he grabs it hurls it out the balconys sliding glass door and exits
sailing end over end through the air
as the mask flies out into the sir a sudden wind kicks up
the mask arcs back toward the building like a boomerang and lands balanced precariously on a narrow ledge
its mocking grin seems to glow with triumph
the place looks like its been hit by cartoon graffiti guerrillas everythings printed in polka dots checks tartan etc
the ripley auto finishing sign hangs askew over the doorway
letters have been sprayed out to read rip off
several reporters and curious onlookers stand nearby as kellaway and his men take it all in
paramedics appear wheeling burt and irv out of the building on two gurneys
theyre both in severe discomfort and look more like cars than men bodies spray painted metallic colors hood ornaments glued to their foreheads wire rims under each limb and gleaming
four foot long mufflers sticking out of their rear ends
they wince in pain at each tiny bump of the gurney
paramedic speaks into his emergency radio phone as burt and irv are loaded into the van
i want a proctologist standing by
yeah you heard me
the best one you can find
an officer steps out of the building and approaches kellaway
we were able to get a description lt
but its pretty weird
let me guess
big green head
how did you
whoever this guy is hes a world class twisto
peggy brandt an attractive young woman in her mid twenties appears besides the other reporters and approaches kellaway notepad in hand
excuse me lt
im with the evening star
can you tell me what happened here
too early to comment
it looks like some kind of mob scare tactic
i said no comment
now break it up
this is a crime scene
as the officers disperse the reporters and other onlookers peggy slips away from the group
even though its closed off with yellow police tape peggy slips inside the garage
the empty garage has been turned into a topsy turvy nightmare
the same cartoon paint job covers the walls
peggy looks around through some papers scattered all over the floor
then she spies the complaint box
peggy opens it and pulls out a handful of pink comment slips
she looks at them
almost all of them are from one customer stanley ipkiss
stanley still looking rumpled and unshaven hurriedly takes off his coat and powers up his computer
charlie steps over to his desk carrying a newspaper
what happened to you last night
the girls and i were looking all over for you
i uh didnt feel so good
i decided to go home early
as a matter of fact you dont look so good
you got to take better care of yourself man
how was the club
are you kidding
it was hotter than a pistol
did you see the paper
your girlfriend got a great review
chralie flips open the entertainment section of the evening star
theres a great close up of tina singing her heart out with the bombshell explodes at monnkeys paw
dickey the smarmy office manager who is younger than stanley now appears
youre forty minutes late
every time you do that youre robbing this bank of its time and money
it wont happen again
snatches newspaper if you werent so busy ogling girlie pictures youd get some work done around here
shes a prospective client of stanleys sir
sudden attitude change she is
next time she comes in see that you send her directly to my office
yes sir mr
dickey tosses the paper back on stanleys desk and marches off through the bank
look at that little creep
if it wasnt for his daddy hed be out somewhere shakin down school kids for lunch money
stanley toys with the kleenex that bears tinas lipstick kiss
you think she ever will come back charlie
forget about her stanley
a dame like that is always looking for the b
the bigger better deal
ask her what her sign is and shell say dollar
you dont know that
shes an artist
maybe shes sensitive
she can sense a guys credit line at two hundred yards
stanley you need a girl you can depend on
someone a little more down to earth
as peggy brandt stops by a tellers window looking sharp and pretty in a blazer and jeans
excuse me can you tell me where i can find stanley ipkiss
someone like her
straightens tie as a matter of fact i could use someone like her myself
rises as peggy approaches hel lo there
may i be of some assistance
charlie begrudgingly points to stanley
im peggy brandt
im with the evening star
i already have a subscription thanks
oh no actually i just wanted to ask you a few questions
ripley auto finishing
youre a customer of theirs arent you
i think you must have made a mistake
peggy produces one of the complaint slips
isnt this a form of theirs you filled out
nervous chuckle oh that ripley auto
i guess i have stopped in there once or twice miss
what did you say your name was
wait a minute
peggy brandt of ask peggy

nice guys finish last
stanley do you realize how much mail we got about that letter
theres hundreds of women out there who are looking for a man just like you
are you serious
do you know how hard it is to find a decent man in this town
most of them think monogamy is some kind of wood
why are you covering this story
they cut my salary
i just cant make it by on dear peggy anymore
the truth is i want to be a real reporter and if i can break this story i know theyll let me
sits closer look stanley i know ripley auto is a crooked operation
they may even have had ties to the mob
im not out to get you
i just want the truth
i wish i knew the truth peggy
i really do
a well dressed man checks from beneath his sunglasses to see nobodys watching and raps on the door
it opens and he quickly inside
sweet eddy escorts him inside
the man removes his glasses and glances about nervously
dorian sits at his desk
freeze and chun woo are going over an array of high tech burglary equipment laid out on the air hockey table
good afternoon councilman snell
nice of you to drop by
cut the crap
whats so important that i had to come here in person
dorian gazes out the window to the valhalla casino
i got a little job for you tom
i want you to pull the swedes gambling license
he was approved six months ago
pull a few strings
find something in the fine print
i dont care how you do it but do it
you owe me
i owe you nothing you little piece of shit
i got your liquor license when nobody else would touch
dorian suddenly explodes overturning his desk and sending snell tumbling backwards
in less than a heartbeat he grabs snell by his shirt ffront slams him up against the wall smashes a whiskey bottle and presses the jagged edge to his throat
snell hangs there whimpering
dorian has a crazed look in his eyes as he gazes at the councilmans lapel
what is that a carnation
dorian takes a deep whiff
call my florist
two dozen pink carnations to mrs
snell with my regrets over her husbands untimely accident
tears begin to well up in snells eyes
i can do it
i can make it happen
dorian eases back
brushes off snells coat
youre a very smart man
now pull yourself together
look at you
dorian picks up an uzi from dr
shut the swede down snell
well buy him out cheap with a little collateral the bank is about to provide us
looks at his men and gentlemen
we are going to be in the casino business
distant sirens can be heard over the occasional sound of a gunshot
its a reasonably peaceful night in edge city
camera slowly pans off of tinas picture which is now taped to stanleys dresser mirror
to stanley himself as he tosses and turns in a fitful sleep
milo lies curled up at the foot of the bed
he looks concerned over the little noises stanley is making in his sleep
camera pushes into an e
of stanley as we stanleys dream a s noir style montage huge soft lit faces loom over him one dissolving into the next
tina luminous and breathtaking speaks under heavily lidded eyes
or it could be two lovers
that would be the woman on top of course
charlie looms up out of the darkness
forget her stanley
ask her what her sign is and shell say dollar
dickey appears glaring down angrily at stanley
every time youre late ipkiss youre robbing this bank
the shrink from the larry king show floats by on a cloud of pipe smoke
we must repress our id
our deepest darkest desires
finally tina again standing beside the limo as she was that night in the monkeys paw alley hey are you okay
stanley stands at the curb but this time hes not splattered with mud
hes decked out in first class armani and looks suave as hell
he looks straight into her eyes
i am now
she runs to his arms and they embrace in a passionate kiss
but tina suddenly pulls back and begins rapidly licking stanleys ear
which is kinda weird
stanley suddenly realizes milo is licking his ear
and hes just woken up
he pushes milo away tosses back the covers and rises out of bed
its still the dead of night and stanley is all in a huff from his dream
he spots tinas clipping on his dresser mirror and rips it off upset with himself
stanley wheels about and to his complete surprise sees
through his bedroom window propped up on the fourth story ledge
its leering grin seems to beckon stanley as we begin to hear the pounding beat of the mask f
stands transfixed staring at the moonlit face
he can almost hear echos of faint whispered voices calling his name
a deadly siren song above the pounding drums
he backs away from the window
shimmers as the whispers grow louder
takes a last look at the crumpled picture of tina in his hand and finally loses control
he bolts from the room
stanley is a driven man as he makes his way out onto the narrow ledge
milo tugs at his pajama leg but stanley kicks him away and climbs out over the ledge
stanley wavers precariously on the crumbling masonry then catches his balance
his face is bathed in sweat as he gazes at the leering face
music thunders in his head
faint echos stanley
stanley tries to steady himself his eyes transfixed on his prize
he lurches back out and makes his way one shaky step at a time towards the mask
watches from the apratment window whimpering softly
narrow masonry begins to crumble
carefully reaches down his fingers just brushing the mask as he teeters out over nothingness
night traffic whizzes by down below
screams as he begins to fall jamming the mask to his face
the window suddenly explodes inwards as the whirling stanley mask tornado bursts into the room
milo dives for cover
the tornado scorches the rug as it wheels around the room then screeches to a halt revealing the mask in his full glory
he strikes a grand entrance pose with his arms held high
i gotta be me
i just gotta be me
he zzzips into the bathroom the mask sticks the picture of tina on the bathroom mirror and blows her a kiss
ala big bopper oooooh bay bee
i knoooooows what you likah
he sprouts a couple of extra arms as he madly brushes his teeth sprays on cologne and bats himself with a powder puff all at once
he zzzips into the bedroom
the mask stands before a full length mirror and checks himself out
with a magical hands are quicker than the eye move he wardrobe instantly
now posing in an effete fashion victim don johnson style suit
in a twinkling hes changed again now in mtv rapper style over sized jeans and backwards baseball cap
shakes his head for buttonheads only
he changes again in a flash
this time hes naked except for his calvin klein underwear his stomach muscles appear super cut washboard style
marky mark eat your heart out
he changes one last time and appears in a wild banana yellow zoot suit complete with a snap brim fedora
thats the ticket
s s s mokin
now lets see
the mask quickly searches his pockets
he pulls his pants pockets inside out and a moth flutters out
seems to be a minor cash flow problem here
i dont like to keep a lady waiting but
points a finger in the air first things first
the mask zzzips out of frame
the street is quiet and empty except for a dipsy doodle diaper delivery van parked across from the bank
crowded with dorians men its been set up as a makeshift control room for the robbery
freeze slaps a clip in his mm and looks down through the vans false bottom to sweet eddy who is standing in an open manhole working on a bundle of
whats the e
another five minutes
freeze synchronizes his watch
freeze presses a button on the side of a miniaturized headset hes wearing into headset lookin good here my man
he sits at his desk speaking into a high tech walkie talkie
in the b
dorians wall mounted video monitors display live shots of the club in full swing
nice work freeze
you boy are on your own now
ive got to make sure im seen downstairs
do it man
the doctah is about to operate
freeze turns to his men
cocks his gun lets do our duty and grab the booty
the burglars gather their gear when suddenly the bank alarm starts ringing
freeze looks down the hole to sweet eddy
what the hell you doin fool
i didnt do nothing
to the others cmon
you keep that motor runnin
freeze and company race across the street with guns drawn
freeze and chun woo flatten themselves on either side of the door as burglar drops to one knee and quickly picks the lock
suddenly the glass doors explode wide open as a human whirlwind bursts out of the bank shoots right past them and zig zags up street
twenty dollar bills slowly drift down onto the stunned robbers in its wake
in an instant the whirlwind does a u turn zig zag races back up to them and screeches to a halt
the mask still in his banana yellow zoot suit and carrying huge sacks of money like santa claus plucks those stray twenties from the air one two three
waste not want not
and zzzoom hes off again
hooting laughter like a maniac
freeze pulls his gun
get that sucker
two cop cars now squeal around the corner their sirens blaring and roar up the street at the bank robbers
the robbers race back to the van dive inside and peel out
the police open fire as they roar after them in hot pursuit
bullets tear into the van blowing out the rear windows
the die hard crowd of trendies is piled up outside as usual clamoring to get in
but a buzz of excitement begins to travel through the crowd as one by one they notice
but not just any limousine
as it slowly pulls up by the front of the club we realized its long
the longest limousine wevve ever seen
finally the passenger door rolls into sight and the limo comes to a halt
the door bursts open and out leaps the mask
the crowd parts like the red sea as the mask sashays to the front door
bobby the bouncer gets one look at the mask and actually loses his cool
are you on the list
no but i believe my friends are
fans a wad of cash jackson lincoln and roosevelt
he tosses a handful of loot in the air and struts into the club as the crowd scrambles for the cash
this is the first time weve gotten a good look at the place and its a real eyeful
camera booms down to reveal its wild tropical complete with live exotic birds in huge indoor banyon trees
waitresses in leopard skin leotards make their way across the crowded dance floor with trays full of oversized tropical drinks
camera endframes as the hostess seats dorian at his favorite ringside table and removes the reserved sign
the lights dim an all eyes go to the bandstand
a spotlight hits the stage and tropical ferns part like a gigantic fan revealing
in a glittering gown thats made of little more than sequins and mesh
if there were such a thing as fashion police this dress would be arrested for disturbing the peace
she talks sings the intro of her number a capella
theres all kinds of men in this old world that seek the affections of a beautiful girl
but of the men from which to choose theres only one type that i
and now the band slides in in classic torch song style as tina sings checks appeal
she works the room throughout the song driving the men crazy as she lingers by each table
you can keep your cowboys on the farm the gigolos dont make me warm its mink my fingers crave to feel i need a man with checks appeal
the mask is seated at a table on the other side of the club and immediately reacts when he lays eyes on tina
his eyes bug out on stalks an ahooga horn sounds and his heart starts pounding wildly shooting two feet out of his chest with beat
customers at nearby tables are astonished
pretty boys are such a bore theres manly macho types galore but youll always know the diamonds real if youve got a man with checks appeal
the mask snatches a bottle off a passing waitress tray and sucks it down in one gulp
his head vibrates like an electric paint shaker
he claps both hands on his head to hold it still
sweet eddy looks nervous as hell as he appears beside dorian
what the hell are you doing here
we got trouble
you better come upstairs
dorian immediately rises and hurries through the corwd towards his office
as he continues to ogle tina
his face now elongates into a wolfs
he howls whistles pounds his fist on the table and stomps his foot on the floor
dont want to see too fanatic but dollar signs are so romantic i want a love thats deep and real just with a man thats got
big finish checks ap peaaal
the audience goes crazy
tina takes a bow
suddenly the mask zzzips around the perimiter of the club leaps up on top of the piano and snaps his fingers
a spotlight hits him
lets rock this joint
he grabs the stuffy tuxedoed pianists stool and spins it hard
when the pianist stops twirling he been transformed into a hip be bopper who immediately starts pounding out a mean boogie the mask produces a conductors baton from thin air
spins around and magically whips the rest of the band into a frenzy wailing out a driving rock n roll tune
satisfied with the music the mask leaps down onto the dance floor grabs the astonished tina and drags her off her feet into a wild special watches amazed as
put fred and ginger to shame
jiving away at warp speed the mask movves like a combination of gumby and barishnikov
he shoots beneath his legs snaps her back into midair spins her like a baton and hits the floor in the splits without missing a beat
s s s smokin
dorian and sweet eddy enter to find dr
freeze sitting there gasping in pain with a bar towel pressed against a bloody wound in his side
what the hell happened to you
ill be okay
nobody puts the chill on freeze
wheres the money
deal went south bro
someone else hit the place before we did
dude looked like a freakin goblin or something
next thing we know theres cops all over us man
wheres chun woo
takin a dirt nap
it was bad man
swallows hard i need a smoke
dorian taps out a cigarette places it between dr
freezes lips and lights it
but the flame doesnt draw
the cigarette tumbles from freezes mouth
dorian glances back up and sees that dr
freezes eyes are glazed over in death
dorian leaps to his feat and hurls his chair across the room in anger
it smashes the mirror over his bar
son of a bitch
who did this eddy
eddy is staring at dorians t
on it the mask can still be seen in the midst of his wild dance with tina
thats the guy
dorian grabs a
from his desk checks the barrel and jams it in his coat
the mask spins tina all around him like a top and then shoots her straight up into the air
amazingly she continues somersaulting at the apex of her ascent suspended in mid air by her magical momentum
stands there nonchalantly filing his nails whistling to himself
tina continues to spin in place high above him
casually checks his watch
without looking up he holds out one hand for the catch
a final somesault and she drops right back down into his arms
they go straight back into a rockin hitterbug without missing a beat
dorian and eddy race down the steps guns drawn
dorian calls to bobby by the hostess stand
clear the club
the dances grand finale
the mask spins tina around and around his body like a baton in one of those awful hawaiian fire dances
as the band bangs out the final bars of the tune the mask screeches tina to a halt bends her over backwards and nails her with a valentino kiss that
literally blows her shoes off sssmack
she hangs onto the masks tie for support when bang the tie is shot in half
tina falls on her cute behind
the shot away piece of the masks tie flutters to the floor and morphs back into a piece of stanleys pajamas
stands at the edge of the dance floor his smoking gun trained on the mask
gasps in mock horror gee willickers
does this mean we wont make the star search finals
this means you wont make it out of this club alive if you dont tell me where my money is
the mask immediately whips out an old fashioned pull handle calculator snaps on a green visor and starts tabulating
ka fast talking you got a
in t bills amortized over the fiscal yeah in stocks and bonds carry the nine and divide by the gross national product
now cut that out
turns to eddy ventilate this goon
eddy pulls out his
and starts blasting blam
the mask dodges the bullets by contorting his cartoon flexible body
the mask spins once and freezes in a pirouette now dressed in a tutu
the mask spins again and stops dressed as a matador the bullet whizzes under his cape
a hockey goalie bats the bullet away
a russian dancer leaps over the shot
a cowboy ding
takes the hit
the mask staggers back
the forwards in a classic western death scene
he throws an arm around sweet eddy for support
you got me pahdnuh
cough eddy seems touched by the masks dying words as he holds him in his arms
hold me close red
its a gettin dark
tell auntie em to let old yeller out
cough tell tint tim i wont be makin it home for christmas
tell scarlet i do give a damn
and the mask gives up the ghost his pink tongue flops out the side of his mouth
eddy bursts into tears
suddenly a huge cartoon audience pops up silhouetted in the foreground applauding wildly
an off camera arm shoots into frame handing the mask an oscar
the mask leaps to his feet and starts taking bows
you love me
you really love me
dorian pulls out his own
and opens fire
the mask starts hooting laughter and ricochets off the dance floor
dorian gives chase but suddenly the nightclub doors are kicked open and kellaway and a squad of police burst into the room with guns drawn
drop it tyrel
dorian lets his
clatter to the ground
kellaway retrieves it
you got a warrant or did you just drop by for a night cap
i got probable cause
a couple of your boys were spotted knocking over edge city bank
one of his men begins to roughly frisk dorian easy junior
youre givin me a woodey
one of them was wearin some kind of big green mask
for once youre on the right track but thats not one of my men
maybe you ought to try a little actual police work instead of this harassment bullshit
this isnt harassment
you want to see some harassment
to his men search the place boys
his men begin to tear the club apart
ever wonder why you didnt make captain asshole
i got friends so high up theyd give you a nose bleed
kellaway hauls off and cracks him in the face with a solid right cross
well what dya know
i guess they gave you one too
dorian shakes it off and glares at him
youre a dead man
one of the officers now appears on the stairway
we got a stiff upstairs
one of the guys from the heist
cuffs him better call that high priced lawyer of yours tyrel
youre comin downtown
ill be back on the streets before sunrise and you know it
then just think of this as the citys way of showing you a little hospitality
pats him on the cheek ill stop by to tuck you in myself
as the police drag dorian outside kellaway notices someting on the dance floor
kellaway picks up the slice of pajama fabric that was once the masks tie and inspects it closely
its the same fabric kellaway saw stalney wearing that morning
kellaway exits and walks right past the poster of tina
flattened into the poster with his arm around her is a cartoon of the mask
the eyes follow kellaway as he speaks to two cops guarding the door
youre on your own boys
dont worry lt
if hes in there well get him
kellaway slips the pajamas fabric in his pocket
and if hes not i got a feeling i know where to find him
as kellaway heads for his car the mask slips out of the poster still flat as a pancake slides along the wall behind unsuspecting policemen and around the corner to
milo growls frisbee in mouth
stanley wakes up with a massive headache and dark rings under his eyes
the mask which lies on the pillow next to him is taking a greater and greater toll
theres a banging on the door
stanley runs to the closet to hide the mask
the instant he opens the door an avalanche of cash pours out suffocating him
oh my god
i know youre in there
stanley grabs the frisbee and starts shoveling the money back into the closet
now the doorbell starts ringing
all right im coming
stanley tosses the mask and the frisbee into the closet and slams it shut
he scoops up a few stray dollars and throws them under the bed
he hurries to the door and opens it an easy smile on his face
lieutenant what a surprise
what can i do for you
you can answer a few questions
ive got to get ready for work
your banks opening late today
kellaway steps into the apartment without waiting for an invitation
stanley glances nervously back at the closet
milo is scratching at the door
where were you last night
is something wrong
maybe its all just a crazy coincidence that this so called mask character always seems to be wherever you are
dont insult my intelligence ipkiss
first hes spotted in your building then the bank where you work and now i find this at the monkeys paw
he displays the torn piece of fabric
it matches the piece missing in stanleys pajamas
milo yaps and leaps up trying to open the closet door
moves the dog away okay so i went out on the town last night
a guys got to have a little fun
in your jammies
milo is back at the closet door
hes just about got it open as stanley turns the detective to the door
naw i just took em with me in case i didnt make it home
i dont know about you lieutenant
but ive got a pretty good track record with the ladies
kellaway pulls away from stanley and begins suspiciously sniffing the air around him
wait a second
you smell that
i hate the smell of bullshit
dont even think about leaving town ipkiss
ill be in touch
kellaway slams the front door just as the closet door falls open spilling all the cash
milo happily snatches his frisbee
stanley sinks back down on his bed
what are we gonna do milo
what are we gonna do
a replay of the bank robbery from the banks grainy videocams
a blurred image of the mask is visible as he zig zags around the bank at high speed
kellaway sips a cup of brackish coffee as oliveras freeze frames the best image of the mask
theres a wild eyed look of glee on his face as he stuffs sacks full of money
i dont know boss
thats one helluva rubber mask
wheres the lab report
oliveras hands it over
we got fingerprints on some of the currency but nothing matches tyrels men
looks like this guy beat em to the punch
get the banks employee files and run down the prints on a guy named ipkiss
you figure it was an inside job
yeah and all i need is a couple of prints to lock this wack job up till doomsday
dorians assembled a war council
at the table are sweet eddy and assorted button men from the citys underworld
an open attache case filled with stacks of money sits before dorian
a fifty thousand dollar reward to the man who finds this mask character before the cops do
get the word out to every street hustler and low life in this town
pounds his fist i want him here
in my office
now get going
everybody scrambles out of their seats
tina sits in the corner of the room painting her nails
she glances up at dorian
what are you looking at
youre losing it dorian
im losing nothing
except maybe some extra baggage i dont need around here
whats that supposed to mean
you werent putting up much of a fight when that green goon kissed you last night
cmon did it look to you like i had a choice
maybe you did and maybe you didnt but i know this one day real soon im gonna run this town and when i do theres gonna be payback for anyone
who crossed me
glares at her i mean anyone
the place is in general disarray but still functioning jammed with worried depositors
stanley makes his way to his desk his face pale and unshaven
dark circles ring his eyes
we have a crisis on our hands here and you stroll in over an hour late
if i have to put up with your slovenly
stanley develops an odd facial twitch then
back off monkey boy before i tell your daddy how youre running this branch like its your own personal piggy bank
if the i
saw some of those files we could arrange a little vacation for you at club fed
dickey is absolutely shocked into silence by this outburst then
that will be all ipkiss
dickey turns on his heels and exits
charlie schumacher now appears glowing with new respect for stanley
what side of whos bed did you wake up on
im not sure
i havent exactly been myself lately
for a split second stanleys entire face contorts into an alarming mask like expression
yeah well you look like you could use a little r and r there buddy
and as a matter of fact ive got just the ticket
or should i say tickets
im afraid to ask
charlie flashes two tickets
grand opening of the valhalla casino

stanley suddenly spots tina making her way across the room to his desk
excuse me a second
what are you doing here
i heard about the robbery
i guess i just wanted to make sure you were okay
oh dont worry about me

you look a little
im just having a little trouble sleeping is all
i guess you wont want to open that account after all this
im not so sure ill have much to open an account with anymore
what about the nightclub
i thought you were doing great
i dont know how much longer i can stay there stanley
things are getting a little intense
well there must be plenty of other places you could sing
maybe even get a record deal
i wish it was that easy
theres thousands of girls out there just like me who
not just like you
youve got a voice like
like an angel
lights a cigarette an angel huh
thats the first time ive heard that one
no i mean it
you really do
i can vamp my way through a tune
but thats not really singing
what is it with you tina
why dont you believe in yourself
i guess ive just heard a lot of promises from a lot of guys
in the end they all wanted the same thing and it wasnt a song
so maybe youve been singing for the wrong guys
im not so sure theres any other kind
not for me anyway
well im glad nobody got hurt
what about this guy the mask
do the cops have a line on him
im not sure
why are you interested
promise you wont say anything
he came to the club last night and he was just so
i havent been able to get him off my mind
they say hes pretty weird looking
but hes kinda cool
yknow like mick jagger
you really think so
if you hear anything about him would you call me at the club
stanley nods unsure of what to say
tina opens the door but before she exits
i sort of know the guy
were old college buddies him and i
are you serious
to tell you the truth im sorta covering for him on this bank thing
hes not such a bad guy really
he just gets a little carried away
do you think you could give him a message
i suppose so
tell him i want to see him again when
i mean id need to tell him exactly
how about seven oclock tonight at peninsula park
i mean ill make sure hes there
peggy parks her car in her space locks it up and beeps on the car horn
when she turns she notices a shadowy figure watching her from a bark corner of the garage
she hurries down the row of parked cars clutching her purse to her side
the figure follows at a slow but relentless pace
peggy fumbles for her keys finally finds the correct one and enters the building
peggy is relieved as she reaches her apartment door and slips the key in the lock
but the lock is jammed
she tries and tries again
suddenly a hand enters frame and slaps an eviction notice on her door
i had the locks changed this afternoon
you cant do that
youve known were going condo for six months peggy
i cant stall the owner a minute longer
either you pony up the downpayment or youre out
just a couple more days phil
the papers ready to give me a full time job
ive heard that one before
cmon at least let me get a few of my things
phil considers this a beat then unlocks the door for her
dont make me regret this
we get a certified check by noon tomorrow or a sheriff will escort you out of here
youre a sweetheart
peggy picks up her things when she hears an off camera pssst
stands in the shadows by the fire escape
hes got a voice that sounds like hes been gargling glass
i heard you were lookin for a story
who are you
just a guy with a little information lookin to make a buck
but maybe i heard wrong
you dont look like much of a reporter to me
peggy gulps back her fear determined to live up to her job
you give me something worth printing and ill get you your money
whats this about
the guy they call the mask and why dorian tyrels willing to pay fifty large to get him
how do i find this tyrel
careful sweet meat
you break this story and he just might find you
as he enters
dorian and sweet eddy casually step through the front door of the restaurants ersatz chalet facade
sweet eddy takes a position by the door as dorian greets artie the swede at a large oak table in the festeively decorated the swede is flanked by his gunsels
as hes served by a big blonde waitress in a classic peasant girl costume
thanks for coming by kid
my pleasure swede
its been too long
i was worried you were still pissed about that little thing with harry the hat
it was nothing
he was a pain in my ass anyway
here sit down sit down
congratulations on the new casino
thanks but it might be a little early to celebrate
as a matter of fact thats why i asked you to stop by
is that right
have a little something to eat
thats svenska meatballs kid
the real thing
dorian starts to eat
so i tell you dorian its a terrible shame
i put all my hard work into this beautiful casino and what do you think
all the sudden i got all kinda problems with the city
the whole deal could fold
maybe i can help you out
im expecting to come into a little investment capital shortly
if worse comes to worse and you really need to bail out
what a sweet guy
isnt this guy a sweetheart
thanks for the offer dorian but i think maybe i can solve this myself
is that right
you know that councilman you got in your pocket
dorian freezes with a forkful of meatballs halfway to his mouth
he notices a pink carnation squashed into the gravy
well now youve got im in your mouth
how you like that
the swede and his men have a good laugh as dorian spits out his meatball
the swede pulls a gun and jams it under dorians chin
sweet eddy goes for his gun but one of the swedes men pops up jamming a barrel to his temple
to dorian now listen close scumbag
you want to bw in business with me
okay were partners now
im takin fifty per cent off the monkeys paw
you screw with me again and ill send you straight down to hell with your scumbag councilman
you can apologize for eatin him for lunch
take it easy
now get out of my sight
oh dorian heres a couple tickets to my grand opening
and try to dress up nice
its good for business
the mask robs bank police scour the city
its accompanied by a grainy blow up of the mask from the bank video
jams a quarter in the slot opens the machine and pulls out the entire stack of papers
to reveal stanley still looking pale and desperate as he dumps the entire stack of papers in a nearby garbage can
he starts to turn away when he notices an ad on the back of the paper for a book
the masks we wear by dr
arthur neuman the man we saw interviewed on the larry king show
the byline reads the mysterious powers of the identities within us
stanley rips out the ad and hurries off down the street
dozens of them line one wall
masks from all countries and cultures
stanley paces the plush office like a caged animal while dr
neuman sits nearby toying with his pipe
this is extremely unusual mr
barging in without an appointment or
look youre the big expert on masks right
well ive got an emergency here
his face twitches try to calm yourself
now this woman you were telling me about im not sure i understand the problem
ive got a date with the girl of my dreams only she doesnt know its me
stanley suddenly reaches into his briefcase and pulls out the mask
its this thing
takes the mask very interesting
looks like tenth or eleventh century scandinavian
where did you get this
snatches it back i found it
or it found me
im not sure
the problem is its ruining my life
so you believe this actually changes you into a different person
face twitches its turning me into some kind of lunatic
briefly contorts into a mask expression mr
this is just obsessional dellusion
what you have here is nothing more than a piece of wood
but your book says masks
my book uses masks as a metaphor for our complex personalities
the masks we must present to the outside world
to suppress the id
to protect our innermost desires
yeah well this one works in reverse
youre going to have to be willing to work on this delusion or
its not a delusion
alright ill prove it to you if i have to but i wont be responsible for the consequences
there is no such thing as a magical mask
holds up mask last chance to hide all dangerous objects
alright then go on
youre not going to frighten me
stanley takes a deep breath and shoves the mask onto his face
he starts spinning around
stanley just stands there like an idiot
he tries it again
it didnt work
does that surprise you
the mask is nothing but a reflection of you the inner you
stanley isnt listening
hes thinking out load
it worked last night
and the night before
maybe it only works at night
what kind of mask did you say this was
it looks like a representation of loki the norse god of mischief
he supposedly caused so much trouble that odin banished him from valhalla forever
what if he banished him
into a mask
im sorry mr
ipkiss were out of time
but what should i do about my date
do i go as myself of the mask
neuman puts an arm around stanley and leads him to the door
havent you been listening to anything ive been saying
go as yourself
and as the mask
a beat because they are the one and the same beautiful person stanley sees this is a losing battle
he turns and walks out
kellaway sits in this unmarked police car finishing up lunch
the police band comes on
kellaway grabs it
ive got that cross check from the bank files
its ipkiss alright
kellaway smiles to himself
at that moment comes out of dr
neumans office building
he gets in his car and drives off
you want us to pick him up
dont do a thing until i tell you
just keep the swat team standing by
if this guys half as bad as hes supposed to be well need all the help we can get
fires up his engine and pulls away
topiaried ivy reads welcome to peninsula park
a small sign below that reads no dumping
carrying his briefcase stanley enters the park
stanley passes through a stand of trees and nearly bumps into tina
stanley what are you doing here
wanted to make sure you two got together okay
sits down you know i hardly ever stop by here
its hard to believe it was just a garbage heap
looking at the sky its always beautiful at sunset
those methane emissions really pick up the colors
they really do
all those pinks and greens
im sure my cousin will be along any minute
he never shows up anywhere till after sundown
hes sort of strange that way
i guess ill get going
stay for a second
i was thinking about what you said and i uh i want you to know i appreciate it
maybe youre right
if i believed in myself a little more i wouldnt rely on guys like dorian
you mean dorian tyrel
hes sort of my manager
tina youve got to be careful of that guy
hes a dangerous criminal
you really mean that dont you
you ought to hear the stories
no i mean youre really worried about me
real sweet stanley
cmon tina this is serious
how involved are you with this guy
i can take care of myself stanley
i always have
people close to tyrel have a nasty habit of turning up dead or havent you noticed
look this may sound a little cold but i do what i have to do to get by okay
im nobody in this town without dorian
and who are you with him tina
im not exactly sure who i am anymore but at least im trying to find out
if you really had any faith in yourself you wouldnt be hanging on to some kind of free ride
that last bit stung and stanley knows it
a shadow falls over them as the last rays of the sun disappear behind the clouds
im sorry tina
i guess i better get going
stanley gets up and hurries off through the trees
but hes already disappeared
tina starts to follow after when she hears a strange whooosh
a whirlwind begins to kick up the leaves all around her
the mask leaps out from behind a stand of trees in all his glory and literally sweeps her off her feet
with his lower lip thrust out he romances tina in a deep syrupy french voice
jetaime je taime je any old tame
at last we are together mon petite bon bon
kellaway doyle and two other officers are watching from a distance
he speaks into his walkie talkie in hushed tones
this is kellaway
i need back up and i need it now
every available man down to peninsula park
murray an old timer newshound hurries into the room grabs his notebook and pulls on his coat
looks like its gonna be a long night
my wife is gonna kill me
what is it murray
the cops got your pal ipkiss staked out at peninsula park
we just picked it up over the police band
let me cover it murray
you go on home to claire
i dont know peggy
grabs her coat ill take care of ramsey
thanks a million
i owe you one
she gives murray a quick peck on the cheek and runs out the door
the mask is all over tina like a cheap suit stroking her hair grabbing her bod
shes definitely having second thoughts about him as he backs her up to the bench
our love is like a red red rose and im feeling so thorny already id like to nip you in the bud
she ducks his grab but he recovers smoothly flipping out a pack of cigarettes
he pops one in her mouth
his hand is a blur of motion as he sticks dozens of cigarettes in her mouth
he produces a huge blow torch from within his jacket and pops on the flame
let me get that for you
he grabs the gigantic wad of cigarettes as if they were one puts them in his own mouth and applies the blow torch
with one mighty he smokes them all down to gray ash
the ash tumbles away
exhales a huge cloud of smoke aaaaaah
he throws his arms wide and lunges at tina
the mask freezes in mid air arms outstretched and feet suspended off the ground
put your hands up
the masks lips barely move as he speaks in a tiny voice out the side of his mouth
but eu tol me oo freeze
youre under arrest
the mask instantly drops to the ground and throws himself into wildly exaggerated expressions of remorse and pain
i knew id forgotten something
i was so young
so full of life
tears are gushing from stanley masks eyes like twin water taps
he puts his hands out and kellaway slaps on the cuffs
whatll they do with me sarge
thats not my department
doyle reaches into the masks zoot suit and starts tossing stuff on the ground
comb flintstones vitamins sousaphone bazooka picture of kellaways wife
kellaway looks down at the photo
it really is a picture of his wife with a handwritten note call me lover
furious kellaway lunges at stanley masks neck
two other officers restrain him
you son of a bitch
jeez i figured you had a sense of humor
after all you married her
stanley mask honks kellaways nose which makes a loud ahooga noise and runs for it
kellaway starts to follow but discovers hes now handcuffed to doyle
the other police officers draw their guns and give chase as stanley ricochets off through the trees hooting laughter
a twelve foot high stone wall surrounds the park
stanley mask races through the entryway slamming the parks huge wooden gates behind him
the mask throws an iron bolt snaps on a huge padlock slams down a steel plate zzzips up a gigantic zipper hammers in dozens of nails at high speed and
throws himself against the gate panting
but then his eyes bug out on stalks as he sees what lies on the opposite side of the gate
more cops than seems humanly possible
theyre in cars armed antipersonnel carriers hanging from trees parachuting helicopters
and theyre all aiming serious looking guns at him
its all over
put your hands over your head or well open fire
stanley mask looks around like hes trying to figure a way out of this mess then hit it
with that a police spotlight snaps on and the brightly lit park entry way becomes a beautifully lit stage
stanley mask strikes a pose now wearing a straw hat boater and weilding a cane
pedestrians with radios and ghetto blasters look down in shock as a rumba begins playing from every speaker in town
stanley mask sways seductively in time to the music
a female cop steps forward a look of surprise spreaading over her face as against her will she opens her mouth in song
they rave about sloppy joe the latin lothario but havana has a new sensation
its cuban pete rumba by desi arnaz
yes this is a real song
hes really a modest guy although hes the hottest guy in havaaaana and heres what he has to saaaay stanley mask steps up to the stage and tilts the boater
over his eyes casting a sly glance toward the crowd
latin voice they call me cuban pete im king of the rumba beat every time i play the maracas i go chick chick chickie boom
gene kelly on acid stanley mask punctuates his number with any number of sly gestures winking nodding sliding seductively down a street lamp post doing repeated splits on the sidewalk
its his big number
the cops watch this with open mouthed astonishment
kellaway climbs over two of his men to scale the wall
he cant believe his eyes
doyle clamors up beside him
hey hes not bad
kellaway shoots him a dirty look
waltzes into the street prancing just inches from the heavily armed cops
his legs twine around each other like spaghetti then his upper torso spins until theyre straightened out again
still singing yessir im cuban pete
the craze of my native street
when i start to dance everything goes chick chick chickie boom
like some weird loony case of mass hypnosis stanley mask waits for the musical break to coax the armed cops into joining him on the number as the rough and
tumble equivalent of chorus girls
the street takes the look of a busby berkeley musical as the cops high step in time to the infectious rumba beat
kellaway leaps tumbles down from the wall into some bushes and scrambles to his feet
he cant believe his eyes
his cops his tac squad his friggin swat team theyre all in the street dancing with this crazy maniac
stanley mask sidles up to a heavily armed female swat officer dirty dancing her across the street the senoritas they sing and how they sling their sombreros
its very nice
so full of dip
and when theyre dancing they bring a happy ring to their vaqueros they sing their song all the day loonnnggg doyle crash lands beside kellaway and starts out to join
the others but kellaway grabs him by the back of his jacket
you go out there and ill blow your brains out
furious kellaway yanks open the door of an abandoned squad car pulls out a tear gas gun and fires into the air
the sharp report stinging gas seems to break the spell of the mask
the music suddenly stops and the high stepping cops stagger away from the line looking confused
arrest that thing
the cops shaken back to reality fumble for their weapons
the mask takes off dashing into the crowd
spots the mask and races after him calling his men
bumps into an old lady who screams at his hideousness
the mask realizes how obvious he is
he turns away and brings his arms to his head
theres a rippping sound
and when he turns around the mask has now transformed back into
carrying the mask stanley tries to blend in with the crowd
followed by a handfull of officers bears down on him
halt or well shoot
stanley quickly cuts down
stanley races down the lane cops hot on his trail
bullets explode all around him
just as he reaches the next street
screeches to a halt almost running stanley over
the window rolls down revealing
stanley jumps into the passenger seat
peggy rips around the bend easily outdistancing the cops
where are we going
someplace where well be safe
the streets are empty
stanley and peggy sit on stacks of bound newspapers in the vast shadowy shipping room
in the b
a huge machine spews out hundreds of newspapers on an assembly line
everythings mechanized printing folding wrapping
peggy hands stanley a cup of coffee
hes a complete wreck clothes disheveled rings under his eyes
i saw it
i saw the whole thing
whats happening to you stanley
ive lost all control
when i put on this mask i can do anything
be anything but its ruining my life
stanley i dont know whats happening to you but i do know this
that letter you sent my column was from a guy with more guts and heart than any of the creeps ive met in edge city
whatever this mask is you dont need it
stanley ipkiss are already all you ever need to be
do you really mean that
we now hear a door open and footsteps
what took you guys so long
ive been vamping here for twenty minutes
dorian and three of his men stand there with their guns trained on stanley
this is him
you have the fifty thou
sweet eddy flicks open a briefcase lined with cash
when he puts on the mask he becomes that green thingamajig
still dumbfounded peggy what are you doing
you really are a great guy but i just cant lose my condo
you know how hard it is to find an apartment in this city
sweet eddy and a second thug grab stanley and hang him over the steel maw of the whirring news press
wheres the money from the heist
its in my apartment
now i believe you have a pressing engagement
hey you said you wouldnt hurt him
dorian toys with the wooden mask enjoying his control over the situation
one thing at a time
tell me about this mask ipkiss
how does it work
i dont know
you just put it on
the mask fx theme builds dorian raises the mask to his face
better be careful boss
with a crack of thunder a whirlwind of light and power swirls around dorians figure
unlike stanleys transformation dorians is much more diabolical
he grows and changes within a nimbus of roaring light
finally the light dies away and dorian mask rises from a circle of swirling smoke
while stanley was a zoot suited bee bopper in hyper drive dorian mask is more like a hulking evil genie fresh out of the lamp and pissed at the world
his diamond earring and touches of his neuvo gangster look is still apparent but his huge grin stretches out like a rexs under eyes that glow green with wicked power
his voice is a deep inhuman rumble
what a rush
are you okay
im better than ever you idiot
now stop the presses
therell be a new headline tonight
sweet eddy stands there looking disappointed with ipkiss still held dangling above the churning presses
but what about him
dorian mask wheels about and roars at sweet eddy
do as i say
i have other plans for ipkiss
everythings become so clear to me now
peggy sheepishly reaches for the suitcase
if you dont mind ill just take my money and be going
you guys make yourselves at home
dorian mask slides up to peggy threateningly
must you go
what a shame
you and i could make beautiful headlines together
peggy removes his arm from her shoulder
that wasnt part of the deal
peggy snatches the briefcase but dorian mask blocks her exit
you only want whats coming to you dont you
peggy whips out a snub nose
out from beneath her coat
back off freakazoid
i wasnt born yesterday
but you might die today
dorian throws the switch and the presses churn to life
in a flash he snatches peggy off her feet
a girl like you deserves to have her face plastered all over page one
he tosses her into the grinding mill of steel and paper
camera booms down as peggys feet disappear between the presses huge rollers and continues down down past the whirling gears and hydraulics to finally endframe on the chute where the
newspapers roll out on a conveyor belt
headlines in blood red ink now read reporter killed in freak accident next to a picture of a slightly flattened looking peggy her mouth open in a silent scream
what do we do with ipkiss
the police are looking for the mask
we shall give them the mask
get the boys ready
the swedes expecting us at the casino opening tomorrow night
we wouldnt want to disappoint him would we
dorian mask throws his head back and lets loose a deep booming laugh
its unnerving even to eddy but he laughs nervously in and elbows the other thugs to join in
the door is kicked open and two of dorians henchmen burst into the room
milo leaps off the couch and scrables behind the curtains
they yank open the closet door and start scooping the cash into plastic garbage bags
stanley lies in the back seat gagged bound hand and foot and half hidden under a blanket
a thug in the drivers seat pokes his
under stanleys nose
that money better be where you said it was ipkiss or you can ipkiss your ass goodbye
he chuckles at his own little joke
milo peeks out from behind the curtain as the henchmen finish their job
he ducks behind the curtain and looks out the window
of the henchmens car
stanley can barely be seen peeking out the car window
the henchmen pushes him back down
his ears perk up
the boss is in trouble
he checks back outside the curtain
finish up and start out the door carrying the trash bags
milo races right by them just out of sight
the henchmen hop in and start the engine
as the car peels out into traffic milo appears valiantly racing along the sidewalk pedestrians and cross traffic to keep the car in sight
kellaway heads up the steps with sgt
i still cant believe it
hardened cops dancin in the streets
and broadcast all over the ten oclock news
the swat team got an offer to open for wayne newton
the captains going to have my badge for breakfast
with a little pension on top
cmon lieutenant it wasnt your fault
something will turn up
stanley ipkiss is going to fall right into my lap
a car screeches by
the door flies open and a body comes tumbling out knocking kellaway down
he looks up at the body sitting in lap ipkiss
i can explain everything
doyle pulls a green rubber mask out of stanleys pocket
kellaway starts hauling him up the precinct steps
you have the right to remain silent you freakin looney tune
anymore of your half baked wisecracks can and will be used against you by me personally
youve got to listen to me
kellaway and doyle drag stanley into the precinct just as milo charges up
but the dog is shut out of the station
bruised beaten and exhuasted stanleys thrown into a small cell
the key guard locks the cell up then walks away
stanley looks around his dismal quarters
a filthy toilet
the cot even worse
theres a yowling
he climbs up on the cot and looks out the small barred window
theres a dumpster below the window overflowing with trash
next to the trash heap is milo
the dog looks up at stanley and yips happily
stanley forces a smile
go find yourself a new home milo
it looks like im going to be here for a long long time
milo watches stanley recede back into the cell
stanley lies on his cot staring at the ceiling
the guard bangs on the door
you gotta visitor
about time you found me a lawyer
a beat tina
your boyfriend kick you out for not delivering me on schedule
is that what you think that i set you up
i dont know
but ive got plenty of time to figure it out
youre just going to have to trust me on this
now is not the best time for me on trusting women
i ran out on dorian last night stanley
i just came to tell you im sorry
sorry about everything
you ran out on him
that magic mask of yours turned him into some kind of monster
he wasnt exactly mother theresa in the first place
hes going to the casino opening tonight and hes planning to do something terrible
a real change of pace for him
half this town will be there stanley
i tried to tell the cops but they wouldnt listen to me
as long as hes got the mask theres nothing they can do to stop him anyway
theres nothing anyone can do
there must be some way
how does it work
its like it brings you innermost desires to life
if deep down inside youre a little repressed and
a hopeless romantic you become sort of a love crazy wild man
and if youve got a black heart
then the worlds going to be a very dark place
and if i were you id get out of town
tina takes a beat and absorbs this information
lots of things
for really believing in me when i couldnt
for sharing a sunset with me
for being the first guy to treat me like i was a person instead of a slab of meat
a beat and for being any kind of romantic
even a hopeless one
you know that night at the club i knew i met someone special
someone like nobody id ever met before
the guy that was inside the mask all the time
stanley ip they draw closer
the iron bars scrunch up their faces
a sweet soft and romantic kiss
the key guard pulls her away
times up lady
ive got to disappear for awhile stanley
im not sure where ill go but ill let you know as soon as i can
stanley takes a long last look at tina as shes escorted out
warily tina slips out of the precinct
shes about to cross the street but spots a suspicious limo engine idling
quickly she doubles back and heads behind the station
she looks over her shoulder
no ones there
tina hurries toward the next street and roars up cutting her off
she turns and runs back the way she came but freezes when the limo screeches up blocking her
sweet eddy and hicks jump out of the limo
stanley watches helplessly as tina is dragged into the limo
frantic stanley runs to the cell door
to the key guard hey
a girls being kidnapped out there
the guard tunrs up the volume on jeopardy drowning stanley out
a slick modern house on the hills overlooking edge city
sweet eddy pulls tina from the limo
sweet eddy and huey enter and push tina roughly into the room
dorian rises to meet her
baby there you are
he embraces her i was gettin all worried about you
i just went out for a little while dorian
sweet eddy holds up a small suitcase and an overstuffed shoulder bag he got from her car
looks like maybe a long little while right baby
dorian grabs her by the throat and slams her against the wall
the pictures rattle
you know what happened to the last bitch that ran out on me
nobody else does either
nobody ever will
he tosses her onto the bed
she lies there gasping for breath
now fix yourself up baby
and pick out something pretty to wear tonight
dorian picks up the mask and admires it
were going to make a big splash at that opening
one this town will never forget
agitated stanley paces around the room
stanleys eyes pop open
he stands up clunking his heaad on the upper bunk
peers down the hall and sees watching a tv boxing match
hes chewing on the leather key chain strap
theres a half eaten sausage and a wedge of cheese on the desk
climbs up on the cot and looks out the window
stage whisper milo
just a pile of trash
the dogs gone
a filthy blanket moves
and milo emerges from it tail waggling as he sees stanley
the little dog jumps up helplessly trying to reach the window
come on boy
milo gets an idea
he jumps on boxes and trash bags using them as steps
he climbs higher and higher until hes reached the top of the dumpster
come on milo
milo jumps from the dumpster
he almost reaches the window but falls back down again into the trash heap
the dog leaps a second time
on this jump stanley grabs him and brings him through the bars
stanley gathers milo up in his arms
the dog licks his face and yelps joyously
stanley muzzles him and peeks the key guards snoring in his chair
the chewed leather key chain strap is still in his mouth
his half eaten sausage and cheese still lies before him
shows milo the guard then whispers in the dogs ear
get the keys
milo cocks his head at the sound of the word keys
he zips out through the bars
milo trots down the hall and approaches the key guards station
the dog stares and sniffs at the snoring man
milo returns slipping back into the cell
he pulls the wedge of cheese out of the dogs mouth
i said keys not cheese
k e y s
stanley pushes the dog back out the cell
he approaches the guard and stops staring at the keys dangling from the mans mouth
milo jumps up on the desk and bites down on key chain
he starts to pull when
the guard stirs and almost wakes up
a moment later the guard starts snoring again
milo grabs the keys and trots back to stanleys cell
atta boy milo
now lets see if we can get out of here
built on pilings at the edge of the marina the extravagant vegas like structure looks like a stylized viking castle
production note key mater shots will be matte paintings
reporters and tuxedoed guests crowd around as the swede and town dignitaries prepare to cut a huge red ribbon and officially open the casino
two statuesque blondes in scanty valkyrie viking goddess costumes present the swede with a gigantic pair of scissors
the applaudes and flashbulbs pop
so ladies and gentlemen with a special thanks to mayor tilton and everyone else who made this possible i give you
the valhalla casino
with a mighty snap of the scissors the swede cuts the ribbon and the doors of the casino open wide
dorians limo barrels through the streets of edge city followed by two sedans full of his men
as it disappears behind the clouds
camera pulls back as the limos moon roof slides shut
we tilt down to discover dorian and tina dressed to the nines for the opening
dorian holds the mask in his lap
its almost time
tina nervously starts to light a cigarette
dorian snatches the lighter away from her
i wouldnt do that sweetie
we dont want to start the celebration early
dorian flips back a blanket covering four compact wooden crates marked c caution u
now sit back and try to relax
ive got to change for the party
dorian slowly raises the mask to his face as tina watches in horror
the tinted glass lights up from inside like muted fireworks as dorians transformation begins
camera pans from his snoring mouth down to his gun as a hand carefully lifts it out of his holster
gun in hand stanley silently backs away with milo at his side
the guard chokes off a snore and begins to wake up
he sees stanleys cell door standing open and goes for his gun
but grasps air
puts one hand over his eyes and slams the butt of the gun down as hard as he can on the guards head
the guard drops back on his chair unconscious
stanley peeks from beneath his hand and regards his work
milo yips happily
stanley turns and starts for the door when he bumps straight into lt
stanley is shocked but quickly realizes hes got the gun
he points it at kellaway with greater authority
i warn you
im seriously stressed out here
dont be an idiot
youre in the middle of a police station
theres no way youre just going to walk out of here
stanley pockets kellaways gun while keeping him covered with the guards gun
he pulls the handcuffs from kellaways belt and begins to handcuff the two of them together
now what are you doing
putting myself in your custody
you are certifiable
stanley unbuttons his shirt and holds it open
milo immediately jumps inside and stanley buttons up
he now looks like he has a pretty nasty pot belly but otherwise okay
now we have to hurry or well miss the party
we wouldnt want to keep alice and the white rabbit waiting
keeping the gun jammed in kellaways ribs stanley folds his jacket over his gun hand
we hear it cock beneath the jacket
ka now move
the opening is in full swing as the limo and two sedans pull up to the front doors
as the car hop attempts to open the passenger door it explodes off and shoots ten feet from the car taking the unfortunate car hop with it
dorian mask steps out of swirling mists within the limo in all his wicked green glory
dont be shy tina
i know how you like to make an entrance
he pulls her out of the limo
and i must say thats a dress to die for
or should i say in
dorians men scramble hauling the c out of the limo and racing off into the darkness with their automatic weapons
kellaway and stanley march past policemen felons and citizens in the front desk area looking stiff and unnatural as hell
doyle waves hello from the coffee service as he munches on a chocolate doughnut
where are you taking ipkiss
ehays otgay an ungay
stanley jams him in the ribs with that hidden gun
what did you say
milo pokes his head up out of stanleys shirt but stanley instantly pushes it back down
doyle does a double take wondering whats wrong with this picture as they continue their stiff legged walk out the door
doyle gives an uncertain wave with his half eaten doughnut
camera booms down
the casino is a true caesars palace style show place featuring a dragon prowed viking ship thats the of the room
the gaming floor is packed with happy party goers
camera endframes on charlie schumacher as he snatches a drink off a passing waitress tray and turns to a gorgeous valkyrie change girl whose helmet has two large horns sticking
out of it
hello tall nordic and beautiful
one look at you and i know how your hat feels
peenman appears pushing her way past charlie with a paper bag filled with quarters
out of my way buster
mama feels lucky tonight
she jams a quarter in a slot machine right behind charlie and throws her weight behind the handle
as they suddenly explode inward blowing security man off their feet
dorian mask steps through the smoking ruin dragging tina after him
hes flanked by a half dozen of his heavily armed men
let the games begin
armed security pull their weapons but are immediately blown away by the thugs
the crowd is thrown into a panic
as it tears through the streets of edge city with its siren blaring
kellaway sits in the rear of the car with his hands cuffed behind his back
stanleys at the wheel with milo at his side
kellaway is livid
ipkiss ill have you locked up for this so long sex will be safe again
kellaway is thrown into the door as stanley screeches around a corner
the frightened crowd mills about in terror as dorians thugs seal off the exits
they frisk down their captives for loot and jewelry
orlando runs up to dorian mask with canvas sacks filled with money
we scored over half a mil from the safe
a security guard now pops out from behind a mock stone pillar and opens fire on dorian
orlando dives for cover
the bullets seem to have no effect as dorian rips a viking spear off a wall display and hurls it straight across the room with supernatural force
the spear skewers the security guard sends him flying back and pins him to a slot machine which immediately rings tilt and spills out quarters
you can come out now orlando
i think he got the point
dorian hauls tina over to the vikin ship where his men are wiring up boxes of c and sticks of dynamite
he slams her up against the prow as his men lash her in place with coils of rope
let me go you bastard
whats wrong darling
this is your big production number
you of all people know how important it is to go out with a bang
dorian pulls his walkie talkie out
how goes it
sweet eddy and two other thugs are busy wiring explosives to the pillars that support the pier the casino rests on
all set boss
dorian plugs the timer into the nexus of all the wiring
the real party starts now and ends in
sets timer thirty minutes
stanley screeches to a halt in the cop car
he turns to kellaway brandishing his gun
when i push the red button the safety is off right
im not helping you ipkiss
alright suit yourself
to milo you stay and be a good boy
as soon as stanley shuts the door milo starts pawing at the handle
the swede scrambles under a crap table to escape the mayhem and bumps into mayor tilton
hey watch it
suddenly the entire table is lifted away as if it were a childs toy and they look up into the evil grinning of dorian mask
my dear dear business partner
and mayor tilton
what a surprise
we have just enough time left to play my favorite game
as stanley sneaks in an employees door the coast looks clear
he snaps off the kitchen lights
stanley spots a thug standing guard outside the kitchens double doors
he ducks back down behind a barrel and gets an idea
the label on the barrel reads olive oil
the thug seems to be enjoying the mayhem when he hears an off camera whistle
he pulls out his
and cautiously enters the kitchen to investigate
the thug enters brandishing his gun and cautiously makes his way into the kitchen
he steps into a large slick of olive oil and his legs shoot right out from under him
as he slides across the kitchen floor at high speed
suddenly stanley pops up from behind the overturned barrel with a huge frying pan and slams it right into camera
plucks the gun from the unconscious guard and sneaks into the casino
stanley appears out of the kitchen doors and gets the attention of the nearest captive party goers
charlie turns around
what are you doing here
he motions them over to the kitchen and hands charlie the gun
start sneaking people out the back
watch out for the oil
stanley now makes his way deeper into the casino
milo finally manages to pop the lock and the car door opens
he scurries off towards the casino
the swede struggles desperately as hes tied to a spoke of a huge wooden numbers wheel a kind of upright roulette wheel thats one the casinos attractions
mayor tilton and two other town dignitaries are tied to the other three spokes
let me offa this thing you lousy scumbag
dorian mask pulls three viking hand axes off a wall display and casually begins to juggle them
ive got an ax to grind with you
in fact i got a couple and im afraid they may give you a splitting headache
he nods to one of his men who gives the wheel a big spin
as the captives scream dorian prepares to throw his first ax
round and round she goes
who dies first nobody knows
stanley pops up behind the dragon prow and starts untying tina
hang on tina
stanley look out
stanley ducks just as a viking ax splits the dragonhead right next to him in half
dorian roars with rage as he rushes across the room to the boat
stanley pops back up firing his gun
dorian takes the direct hits
he grins horridly at stanley and he extends his slimy tongue
the bullets all stand there on end in a neat little semi circle
dorian now sucks in a mighty breath
stanley grabs a viking shield and protects tina and himself
dorian blows the bullets back at stanley
they batter the shield
stanleys knocked backwards from the impact
drags stanley out and slams up against the prow next to tina
one of his men immediately begins tying stanley in place
the two love birds
just to show you theres no hard feelings im going to let you spend the rest of your lives together
youve got it all wrong
i could care less about this creep
nobody could replace you dorian
if you think a line like thats going to save your life youre dumber than he is
maybe its too late
then all i want is
one last kiss
a beat sure why not
dorian mask sticks out his slimy two foot tongue and stick his eyebrows back
hiss massive lips flutter as he puckers up
but tina turns her head way
from the real dorian
the guy i used to love
nobody ever kissed me like dorian tyrel
no time boss
this buildings going down any minute
i make the decisions
and ive decided
tina stares at him dreamily
ego gets the better of him
he reaches up and rips the mask off
to give the girl one last thrill
he plants his mouth on tinas kissing her roughly
tina really gets into it
but stanley watches as tina slyly positions the leg that he freed up
right out of dorians hand
it flies into the air
dorian orlando and sweet eddy on the run
but then suddenly
soar straight up through thr human hands and
as though it were a frisbee
the dog lands back on the ground the mask firmly in his mouth
he starts to run away but
dorian grabs his hind leg
cmere you ugly little mutt
legs pumping frantically is losing ground
at the last second he drops the mask and jams his muzzle into it
eyes widen as his pint sized doggy body now has a giant sized green head with a double row of jagged canine teeth
the plain collar now sparkles with gleaming studs
razor toenails distend
the eyes glow hell fire green
reflexively dorian lets go
dog mask unleashes an incredibly loud sonic woof that explodes glass front slot machines all around them
dont let it get away
sweet eddy lunges at the dog mask
but the canine creature runs between his legs and chomps down on his butt
the tiny dog picks sweet eddy up and shakes him back and forth like a rag doll
watches this then takes a look at the ticking detonator
less than a minute to go
he strains at his bonds forcing the rope into a tina winces as stanleys hand rope begins to burn
uses eddy as a club knocking other thugs down
get him off me
dorian raises his uzi and sprays the area with gunfire
dog mask leaps away in the nick of time
weve got the money
lets get the hell out of here
i gotta have that mask
dorian chases dog mask into the maze of slot machines
burns through his ropes
he frees himself and races to the detonator
dorian stalks dog mask whistling for him to come
a stream of water now trickles down on him from above
dog mask is in the chandelier taking a whiz and snorting doggie laughter
dorian sprays the ceiling with gunfire but
pounces on dorian knocking him flat then races out of sight
stanley yanks one wire after another but the timer still ticks down stanley pulls the last wire
the timer stops
tina exhales relieved as stanley unties her
kissing him you did it
as it ticks back to life
a muffled explosion rumbles from beneath the floorboards
the two front support pilings blow up
the entire floor tilts
gaming tables and slot machines start to slide by
stanley grabs tina and hangs onto the prow of the boat
dog mask appears racing up the tilting floor and leaps into the boat as
the entire casino floor drops straight down
straight across the gaming floor towards the huge front doors
screams as the boat slides right over him
the viking ship crashes through the doors and splashes down in the marina as the entire casino sinks into the water
it bobs for a moment then floats
stanley tina and the dog emerge from their hiding place under one of the dining tables
they cant quite believe theyre alive
their faces reflect romantically from the light of the viking torch sconces
we made it
milo lets loose a happy whoof
and leaps into stanleys arms
stanley removes the mask with a schwoop and milo transforms back into a regular dog
ill take that
they turn as dorian clamors over the side of the boat
hes got a gun pointed right at them
stanley slides an iron grappling hook through the masks eye holes and holds it overboard
hold it right there or youll be looking for this on the bottom of the harbor
dorian stops in his tracks
drop it and ill kill you all
you can have it
but she gets to go
were still close to shore
five seconds ipkiss
stanley tosses a wooden barrel overboard and turns to tina
tina takes the dog and slips overboard
dorian moves in
put it down
right over there
dorian waves his gun at the nearest dining table
stanley starts to put down the mask
but at the last instant he tosses it as dorian turns to see where it lands stanley jumps him
dorian fires but misses
stanley jumps dorian knocking his gun away
dorian falls into one of the wall torches toppling it
the two men slug it out as a fire starts
it burns closer and closer to the dynamite the mask in the middle of the pile
tina and milo cling to the floating barrel
sees fire stanley
dorian pummels stanley with a flurry of jabs to the head as the fire sears toward the explosives
but stanley counters with a solid right that rocks dorian back
dorian grabs him by the collar to retaliate but sees
the fire licking at the dynamite casing on which the mask lies
dorian lunges for the mask
stanley jumps overboard
the dynamite explodes
tina and milo watch as the ship blows up
the fireball burns bright smoke everywhere
stanley surfaces gasping for breath
tina pulls him over to the barrel and milo licks his face
and then the smoke parts revealing
standing on the remains of the boat
like wile e
coyote hes charred pitch black with singed hair and clothes
but like a cartoon he just shakes off the soot and stands there in all his fearsome dorian mask glory
what a blast
this mask makes me a god
he picks up the last fizzing but undetonated stick of tnt and laughs
he raises his arms and thunders to the heavens
at that moment the sun peaks over the horizon
do you hear
the suns rays hit the mask
in an instant he transforms back to regular dorian
the mask pops off dorians face useless
dorian stares dumbfounded at the tnt stick in his hand as it ka boom
dorian is blown to smithereens
there are cops everywhere
kellaway wraps tina in a dry blanket
stanley holds out his arms
back to jail lieutenant
ipkiss id like to lock you up for the rest of my life
but the mayor and a hundred other witnesses say dorian tyrels the bad guy and youre the good guy
so no jail
just a downtown parade at noon
and ive got to be your escort
stanley smiles and puts his arms around tina
they head down the beach
the two young lovers and milo walk past standing near the crowd of post party victims being helped by the police and medical personnel
hes still hitting on that valkyrie change girl
so i deck this thug grab his gun and tell stanley take cover buddy
ill get these folks out sae and sound
yknow we should go back to my place so i can tell you the rest of the story
peenman is walking along grumbling to herself when she notices the mask floating to shore with some of the wreckage from the boat
just look at this mess
she picks it up out of the surf and the mask fx theme begins to pound in her head
back to charlie and his valkyrie
so what do you say sweetheart
lets you and me go back to my place and scramble some eggs
peenman mask zzzips up and sweeps charlie off his feet
shes the most whacked out mask creature yet with a huge witch hazel face and bride of frankenstein hair
hello short dark and handsome
cmere and give momma a kissy poo
she starts smacking her king sized lips horribly
put me down
she jams a hand down the front of charlies pants
lets see what caliber pistol youre packing there soldier boy
she gets a grip and squeezes
charlie screams ttears himself from her grasp and starts running for his life
pans with mrs
peenman as she ricochets after him hooting laughter
we endframe on stanley and tina as they watch the spectacle pass them by
they turn and embrace for a well deserved kiss as milo yips happily and squirms up between them
