its an early friday morning and a patrol car drives up an unpaved road and parks next to a gutted police car on cinder blocks
the camera pans with the officer as he exits his car and walks up to a ramp leading to the babay blue jail house
he is carrying a greasy bag of fast food
the officer enters the lobby tosses the bag of food to his partner who is sitting at a desk
he grabs a tin cup and walks over to barred entrance to block a
twenty or so criminals from drunks to drug dealers are sleeping peacefully in their cell on block a
the officer rattles the tin cup between the entrance bar
the inmates stir rubbing their dirty faces and trying to sit up
the camera dollies slowly down the narrow hallway of the block which has three cells two small ones side by side and one bigger cell that faces the block entrance
the sound of scribbling and business dealing can be heard from inside the cell
it is azul jottin ginto a business ledger while chatting on his cellular phone
his cell is equipped with a small desk and a refridgerator
he hangs up the phone and continues writing
the officer with the tin cup sits in a couch across from his partner who is now eating and reads a magazine
azul picks up his phone and makes another call
he talks business
in the other cell prisoners are getting up and looking around
azul hangs up the phone and writes
a gorgeous bikini clad babe struts slowly into a tighly framed glamour shot
she pauses takes a deep breath then dives a perfect ten dive into a house side moat
she swims long slow motion strokes around the moat as the camera tracks alonside her lovingly admiring her tan lines and hydrodynamic build
she slides out of the water and walks up a cobble stone walk dripping as she passes a seated gentleman in a white suit
his face is unrevealed
as she enters the house he sets his drink down by a phone
he lifts up the receiver and dials
azuls phone rings
he looks up at it startled as if no one has ever called him before
he glances at his watch and then back at the phone hesitating to answer it
he looks around the cell block as if someone might be playing a trick on him
finally he answers it pausing before saying hello
it is el moco
good morning azul
do you know who this is
into phone moco
what the hell do you want after all these years
moco is sitting on his porch drinking tequila
into phone weve got a lot to talk about
im just a few town away with a whole new gang
i heard you were nearby so i thought id give you a call amigo
thats sweet of you asshole
i dont suppose you could get me out of there and then maybe hand me over my share of money
into phone yes i figured youd want your money my friend
that is why i have called you
i heard you were getting out soon and figured i should deal with our situation
but do you really need me to help you get out
from what i hear youre running quite a business out of your cell with a phone and some loyal men
it keeps you well protected i hear
not a bad idea
i may try that myself sometime
i could stay in here and earn peanuts compared to what you owe me if i were to get out
so yes i want you to help me
into phone soon my friend soon
im sending you some people in a few days to get you
well thats more like it
just like the moco i used to know
azul is walking towards his window at the sound of a truck racing in
into phone just hang in there my friend
i wont forget that you have been a big part of our success
a large truck drives up to the jail parking beside the police car
two tall well dressed men step out
they reach into the cab and pull out machine guns
they walk briskly towards the jail
azul walks to his toilet and stands on it to see out his barred window
into phone theres something going on outside
is this a double surprise
are you getting me out today moco
there is no response from moco
the guard reading the magazine stands when he sees someone approaching the door
close tracking shot of guns as tall men open the door and enter the jail
azul looks out of the jail cell suspiciously
peering down the hall he sees the guys with the guns
he hides behind the wall peering out to see what happens next
the tall men walk right up to the guard and hand him a huge wad of money
the guard tosses the money to his partner still eating then turns to unlock the block entrance bars
azul puts the receiver back up to his mouth
into phone there are two men here with guns
did you send them
moco glancing at his watch hangs up
azul hangs up the phone and kicks his bodyguard awake
the bodyguard gets up and peers out the bars as azul hides in a corner
the tall men walk steady and alert ready to kill
they enter azuls block and scope out the cells
the bodyguard seeing the tall men retrieves his shotgun from under his mattress and grabs his machete from under the sink
he stands ready to fight
the tall men move slowly towards the big cell somewhat cautious
they see the bodyguard a second too late for he sticks the shotgun between the bars and shoots one of them before they can react
the shot one stumbles back into his buddys arms
azuls bodyguard amused by all this opens his cell door effortlessly and walks out as if to greet them
the tall men hear the sound of the other cells opening so they turn around
the other prisoners on the block begin exiting their cells carrying guns and molotov cocktails
the tall man drops his gun
finally azul exits his cell carrying his phone
the bodyguard forces the tall men into an empty cell closing and locking the door
azul presses the button on his phone
mocos phone number is automatically redialed
into phone im still here moco
and so are your little friends
but not for long
they have something they want to scream to you
listen close because youre going to repeat it to me when i come to visit you
the cellmates throw their molotov cocktails into the cell
moco hears the men screaming as they burn to death
azul is holding the phone at arms length into the cell
the guards exchange glances when they hear the screaming they smile and shrug then go back to what they were doing
as azul and his bodyguards exit the block the guard with the magazine stands up as if to stop them but azul tosses him a wad of money and the
guard sits back down to count it
a blue truck races towards the jail
azul exits the jail carrying a shotgun
his bodyguards get inside the tall mens truck and start it
azul waits patiently for his blue truck
as the blue truck pulls up two little rat like vatos exit the blue truck one handing azul a guitar case
azul tosses it onto the hood
the bodyguards wave as they drive away
azul waves back
he opens the case revealing an arsenal of weaponry
azul notices one piece is missing
one rat quickly pulls the missing weapon from his jacket and replaces it in the case
azul is unamused
he grabs his mac machine gun from the guitar case and aims it at the thieving rats head
suddenly the guard bolts out the jail waving the wad of money as if complaining
azul turns his mac onto the guard instead
a few blasts later azul and his rats pack up and go as the guard twitches helplessly on the ground still clutching the money in his bloody hand
the blue truck barels down the highway and the camera pans with the truck as it passes a hitchhiker mariachi standing in the sun with a thumb in the air
the truck passes him up so he continues walking
mariachi is carrying a guitar case in one hand and a black jacket in the other
he is wearing a white t shirt black pants
the camera pans to a sign that reads acuna miles
mariachi is walking around downtown acuna
he notices a bar across the street and liking the way it looks he puts on his jacket and crosses over to it
he stops to read a sign on the building that says members and non members only
he prays silently to himself before confidently walking inside
mariachi enters the club greeting the patrons as ge makes his way to the bar
no one seems to greet him back
he sits on a barstool near some other drinkers laying his guitar case down lovingly beneath his stool
he looks around the place as if sizing it up
what do you want to drink
the other drinkers stare at him
glancing around the room mariachi notices a small table shaped object draped with a cloth in one corner of the room
sitting directly behind him are four mean looking dudes
mariachi is served his drink
no hay musica
cleaning a glass why
im a mariachi
a good one
i play beautiful ballads old classic ballads on an old fashioned guitar
i could add a little class to this place
i work for fairly cheap i live mostly off tips
but i need steady work and i can guarantee bringing in more customers
nodding tell me why would i need one little guitar player when ive already got a full band
mariachi gives him a silent what look
the bartender motions to a young man sitting near the small draped table
the young man removes the drape revealing a keyboard
puts on his mariachi hat dips his fingers into his shot glass and rubs his fingers together as if warming up for the big show
he hits a few switches in extreme closeup as
mariachi adjusts himself to the seat
the young men gently taps one switch and the keyboard sounds like an accordion pulsing out a beat
he then presses another switch and a horn section swells to a crescendo and waltzes the familiar riffs
he adds the string and horns accents by banging on the keys
he sounds awful
mariachi grimaces slightly then turns back to the bartender who seems to enjoy it
the keyboard mariachi finishes his song sits back down
nodding with satisfaction there you see
either i can pay one guy to sound like a full mariachi band
mariachi picks up his guitar and lays some money next to his full drink
he looks disappointed
or i could spend the same money only get one little guitar player
walking away thank you sir
you want to earn a living
get a real musical instrument
the bartender picks up the bottle of soda pop mariachis left behind and offers it to the other men on the table
they say no pay and leave
the bartender offers it to the mean dudes at the table
they all shake their heads no
the bartender shrugs and dumps it
mariachi walks out and looks up and down the street
he decides to walk south
as he walks down the sidewalk the camera pans into a closeup of another guitar case that is moving towards the corona club
the camera falls back a little revealing the backside of azul dressed also in black
azul walks into the bar
azul enters the bar notices to his left the table with the four mean looking dudes drinking and eating chips and salsa
the oldest one with his back to azul takes a sip from his mixed drink then stands and excuses himself to the restroom
the old mean dude walks into the first stall and sits down
the three remaining dudes notice azuls guitar case
so does the bartender
they all look at each other and laugh
laughing and rolling his eyes what the hell is this mariachi day
there is no work for you here
azul walks the mean dudes table
their laughing quiets down a bit as azul stands before them
the bartender stops smiling
the bartender nods and grabs a frosty glass
he begins to fill up at the tap
without looking at him in a bottle wey
bartender stops filling the beer stares at the half full glass for a moment then drinks the beer
azul is staring at the three mean dudes
they stare back
the bartender slaps the unopened bottle down at the counter
azul doesnt pay attention to him
im looking for an old friend of mine
his name is
do you know where i can find him
you can sometimes find him here
he owns this place
so you know him
we work for him
thats too bad
azul turns to the mean dude sitting to his left and places the guitar in his hands
the mean dude is confused
hold it please
azul opens the case and pulls out the mac
the other two mean dudes are already reaching for their pistols
the bartender ducks beneath the counter
azul fires a million bullets into two of the mean dudes the other is holding the case in shock
their chests explode causing neat little dollops of flesh and blood fly everywhere
the mean dude holding the guitar case is frozen with fear
he manages to look up at azul who is watching the mean dudes die a slow bloody death
the barrel of the mac is smoking
azul turns slowly to the mean dude holding the case
azul aims his mac in the dudes face
still frozen holding the case he spends his last moments looking down the guns barrel
the shots caused old mean dude to peer out from his stall as the toilet paper fell to the ground and started to roll across the floor
he now watches it roll as more shots ring out
he pulls up his pants and and walks toward the door slowly
he is sweating profusely
he slowly picks up the toilet paper plotting his next move
it grows silent
he takes a deep breath and rushes out the door
the old dude bursts into the room with a roll of toilet paper in his hand and a sheet of sweat sliding down his face
the bartender rises up from behind the counter
the camera dollies slowly by the dead dudes
their blood bathed faces twisted into odd shapes and expressions
the camera continues to dolly to the one dead dude still holding the guitar case
his face is a bloody pulp
the camera stops dollying to the old dudes mixed drink
a hand is stirring it with a straw
the camera pans up the arm to reveal azul standing expressionless with his gun sling over his shoulder
shot at fps the old dude quickly drops the toilet paper and runs back inside the bathroom
azul turns to his guitar case and carefully chooses another weapon
he grabs the drink and tosses a napkin over his arm like a waiter then casually follows the old dude into the bathroom
the bartenders glance at each other
one pours a shot glass full of tequila and raises it to his lips to drink it
shots ring out and the bartender spills the drink over himself
without warning azul bursts from the bathroom and walks calmly to his case
he replaces the weapon picks up the case and leaves
a few seconds pass before the bartender grabs the phone and furiously dials
into phone get me moco
the door bursts open as azul reenters storming to the bar
the bartender is so petrified he doesnt think to drop the phone
azul walks right up to the bartender
the bartender shuts his eyes
the sound of the beer bottle popping open canbe heard along with the sound of thirsty guzzling
the bartender opens his eyes to azul
closeup of the empty bottle slamming to the counter
the bartender glances down at the bottle
closeup of azul tossing a few coins near the bottle as payment
a few seconds pass as the bartender is standing there
you hear moco yelling into the receiver asking whats going on
moco is on the porch trying to get the bartender to answer him
into phone you hear mocos voice through the phone
the camera dollies into the bartender as he screams into the receiver
the camera dollies in to the corpses
and finally a low outdoor frontal tracking shot of azul walking away smiling as the image fades out
low angle of hotel coahuila sign
mean dude enters the frame as his beeper goes off
he runs into the hotel coahuila
mean dude enters the lobby where an old clerk is sitting at the counter reading a yellowed newspaper
there is a pit bull on the floor beside him

mean dude grabs the phone and dials mocos number
he glances down at the pit bull lying on the floor
yeah pit bull
the line is picked up and mean dude talks into the phone
he pulls out a piece of paper from his coat pocket and places it on the counter
he begins jotting down four names
he then slowly crosses their names out

the viejo clerk glances up from his paper
the pit bull also glances up
into phone all of them

an inside shot looking out of the front glass reveals mariachi looking at his wallet as mean dude talks to the phone
no one notices him

and what was he wearing
the pit bull turns and looks out of the window
seeing mariachi he gets up and walks to it

mean dude writes down a phone number and the description of azul on a little card
nodding sarcastically and if i dont call youll kill me

the sarcastic smile fades from the old man
mean dude walks away
the old man reads the card then glances out the window
mariachi is gone

the mean dude walks off in the other direction
mariachi enters dominos bar

he hears the sound of mariachis footsteps trailing off
the old man drops the paper and bolts silently to the phone as he dials el mocos phone number
mariachi opens his room tosses his guitar onto the bed and hangs his jacket in the closet
he has only his white t shirt underneath
he glances above the bed to a plaque bearing a mace and two crossed swords
he checks out the shower and washes his face in the sink
he sits down on his bed
a few seconds later he drops back and lays there a minute before kicking the door shut
he tries to sleep
the old clerk is talking on the phone to the bad guys
he hangs up the phone then reaches into the back of his counter for a gun
he places it on the counter and covers it with his newspaper and continues reading

the mean dudes jump out of their truck and rush into the hotel guns drawn
the men burst into the lobby and the old men tells them the room number
they run out into the courtyard with the old man following
the pit bull is uninterested in the action
the mean dudes run up the courtyard stairs and kick open the first door they come to and start blasting into the room
screams are heard

the men rush up the steps shooting at the balcony
bullets narrowly miss mariachi as he climbs over the balcony to safety

mariachi staggers into amadeus and washes his face in a fountain by the door
he makes his way to the bar as a patron pays and leaves
what happened to you mariachi

domino turns around and looks at mariachi wondering hard is hes joking
he lifts up a bloody hand grabs a napkin and then seems to ask permission with his eyes before wiping his hands clean
is it true
mariachi nods an ashamed yes
domino reaches for her gun under the counter
the camera is on mariachi when she brings it out and points at him
exhausted wait a minute

wait a minute domino
it was self defense
she cocks the pistol
frantic im new in town
i dont know everyone

and no enemies
lowering the gun a bit thieves
nodding no way
they were well dressed men
i checked into the cheapest hotel in town no money nothing of value except this guitar and maybe this coat which they could have taken when i left my room
but they didnt
they were only interested in killing me
lifting the gun back up so why do you come here
you want to get me killed
i need a place to stay until i figure this out
theyve got me mixed up with someone else
and youve never seen them before
not even in another town
long pause are you saying they followed me a mariachi here
maybe they hate your music
mariachi stares at her expressionless
she stares back at him
maybe you were singing in another town they hated your voice and now theyre trying to kill you
are you serious
are you going to help me or am i gonna have to die on your porch
i have a room upstairs
dont touch anything
ill be up after awhile and we can call a friend of mine
mariachi shakes her hand
ill never forget this
he tries to kiss her hand
she slides it away and effortlessly slaps him
he follows her to a doorway revealing an unlit staircase
when he enters the darkness swallows him as she shuts the door behind him
mariachi enters a roomy luxurious apartment above the main bar
there is a free standing porcelain tub in the center of the room
mariachi places his guitar halfway between the entrance and the tub
the camera is tracking backwards with him as he walks making th room look endless
he removes his jacket as he makes his way to the tub
he drops his jacket onto the floor and gently climbs into the tub
the camera faces him as he settles back
the camera slowly dollies into him as he lays back crosses his fingers and gives a relaxed smile
domino is washing a glass
she the then remembers she has the gun in her waist belt so she removes it and sticks it back under the counter
wounded mean dude comes in limping
she takes out a towel and drops it on the counter
good morning domino

i have to call moco
she brings up the phone and sets it down where the cloth was
he picks up the cloth and wraps his arm with it
its not as bad as it looks
domino has anyone come through here
a stranger maybe
this is a border town
i get strangers all the time
dressed all in black carrying a guitar case
well he shot me
and has killed ten of mocos men
all in one day
domino looks a little upset
she slides the phone towards him a bit
arent you gonna call your boss
nodding i have to tell moco that he got away again
so you better give me a drink first
domino smiles and pours him half a beer mug with tequila
he laughs and drinks
as hes dialing the camera is on domino as she cleans up a few things every once in a while glancing upstairs
into phone moco he got away
shot me in the arm
killed la palma
this guy is one slick maricon
also i didnt get a look at him
so unless hes still carrying that guitar around and hasnt changed clothes i wont even spot him and i dont think hell be that obvious
if theres one thing i know its that hell always wear black and hell always carry that guitar with him
its his signature
besides thats not a guitar hes carrying
its a guitar case full of weapons
mean dude hangs up and puts his head in his hands
que paso i screwed up
the guy left his guitar case in the hotel room
we chased him out but he came back for the case
maybe he loves his guitar
its probably an antique
it wasnt a guitar
it was a guitar case full of weapons that he uses on his victims
adios im gonna take a nap
and thanks for the drink
mean dude stumbles as he tries to stand
if you see this guy call us
he is about to walk off with the bloody towel and he turns back pointing at it
she waves her hand at him as if granting him permission to take it
she cleans his glass and when he is gone she slams the glass down and runs for the stairs
a few seconds later she comes back into the bar grabs the gun from under the counter and calls her assistant to watch the bar
he sees the gun and wonders what shes up to
she storms upstairs
domino opens the door abruptly and finds mariachi taking a bath
he bolts upright pulls a towel up from the floor and sits frozen waiting for dominos next move
she laughs and walks to the counter
friendly i thought i told you not to touch anything
i needed to relax
smiling no its alright finish up
do you want shampoo
laying back closed eyes yes please
domino turns to a counter and her smile fades
she looks like she wants to rip mariachis throat out with her teeth
she puts the gun down on the counter
she finds an omnious looking knife and then grabs a bottle of shampoo
she walks over to him then pulls the knife up to his throat with one hand while grabbing his hair with the other
he opens his eyes wide
the shampoo hits the floor and begins to roll
who are you
choking im a musician
the shampoo bottle rolls into the guitar case and stops
domino sees this and with her foot reaches out and pulls the case toward her
what do you have in here
mariachi tries to catch his breath pausing before answering her as if wondering if all this is really happening
domino slides her foot out of her shoe and unsnaps one of the latches with her toe
she unsnaps another
the latches snap loud and echo in the quiet room
mariachi gasps as she tightens her grip
youre very modest mariachi
she squeezes his hair and unsnaps another latch
through gritted teeth you told me you killed four men when you really killed seven
or were they still breathing even after you shot out their hearts
another latch snaps
groing dizzy im a mariachi
not a murderer
arent you going to watch
she lifts the lid with her foot
it seems an eternity before the case is fully open
domino is looking into the case but mariachi is not
he knows whats in there
i told you
i am a musician
slow dolly into the case which contains a white well kept classical guitar
domino is seeing it and for a moment she almost believes he is telling the truth
she rushes to it grabs the guitar and tosses it to mariachi
he catches it choking after she releases the blade
she is on the other side of the tub now
she jams the knife down between mariachis legs
mariachis eyes bug
still choking w
domino shoves the knife in deeper and mariachi grimaces horribly
play it damnit play something sweet
mariachi is sweating and his face is extremely red
he pauses for a long time before plucking an odd note
she squints as if shes caught him
but he eventually starts picking out a sweet little melody
growing impatient mariachi starts to sing but chokes on the words
he starts over playing a rancho grande sounding song with his own made up words
in a high sweet voice what is this place
that treats me like a murderer
theyve all got their heads up their butts
even this beautiful girl with a knife to my balls should i kiss her or hit her
he finishes his song bowing and thanking his imaginary audience
domino is smiling
she pulls the knife slowly out of the water and wipes it off on her apron
youre a mariachi all right
and a good one
mariachi bows a solemn thank you
i think this is the best ive ever played
closeup of the knife
domino looks at him with a silent what
hire me to play in your bar
ill work mostly from tips
but i need steady work
i couldnt pay you
i have no money
this fancy place and you have no money
its the truth
ill work for room and board then
please im desperate
thinking will i have to keep a knife at your balls to get you to play like that
smiling not if youre paying me room and board
until i find a permanent job
thinking you wont find a permanent job in this town
she gets up slowly and turns to leave
mariachi settles back smiling triumphantly
suddenly she darts around and slams the knife between his legs again with a furious look on her face
he bolts up out of this triumphant daze with a look of complete shock
she loosens up and laughs
youre going to need a better sense of humor than that if youre gonna work for me kid
she flings her knife aside
it sticks into a wall
she shrugs smiles a beautiful smile turns and goes downstairs
mariachi settles back down closing his eyes
the knife slips out of the wall and clangs to the ground
mariachi jumps again rolls his eyes and sinks underwater as the picture fades
mariachi plays in amadeus
camera tracks past a pool table where two rats are playing nine ball
they make a few shots then the phone rings
the camera continues to track past a small table where azuls guitar case lies open
weapons adorn it with each knife each gun in its pocket in its own place
the camera continues tracking to a dresser on which sits azuls cellular phone
a delicate female hand lifts the receiver
the camera is now positioned above the bed as the girl answers the phone
into phone yes
one moment please
he rolls over and wakes a girl sleeping beside her
girl takes the phone and passes it to a third girl as girl tries to wake azul he is sleeping between girls and
girl has the phone to her ear as if listening for background conversation
the two rats playing pool are staring longingly at the three girls in azuls bed
they look hungry and deprived
one hits the other signaling its his shot
while one shoots the other watches
azul awakens and grabs the phone
into phone yeah
moco is sitting in his pool
a swimming waiter is bringing him drinks
into phone amigo

azul hangs up
he gets dressed and leaves
the little rats are about to follow but one rat walks over to get one look at the girls
the girls tease him and when he tries to advance them they pull guns and laugh as the rat runs away
domino walks by with a trash can
mariachi is sitting on a barstool
i need to get my money back from that hotel
ill be right back
are you crazy
if you go anywhere with that jacket and that case you could be killed
leave that stuff here
mariachi gets up and is about to get his guitar case from under the stool
mariachi leaves it under the stool and takes off the jacket
i never go anywhere without it
take care of it
domino drops the trash can and tells her assistant to watch the bar
she heads for the staircase
domino walks out onto her balcony peering down into the street
pov shot of mariachi walking through the street
domino turns and walks to the phone
she dials a number by heart and sits in a plush chair
moco answers the phone
towel around his neck wet hair
dolly in slow into phone hi
into phone i know who it is
dolly into moco
the clerk is reading a paper
he hears a noise and pulls it aside
mariachi is standing at the counter smiling
the clerk jumps in his seat then after a few frozen seconds he sets down his paper and reaches for mariachis old room key
mariachi shakes his head no points to the register and makes the money sign with his hand
the clerk slowly moves over to the register
he depresses a few keys to open it
it wont open
he makes a gesture like its stuck or something he is not very convincing
he tries again and again each time pretending to get more impatient
mariachi glances down at the pit bull
the pit bull is eyeing mariachi
mariachi points to the clerk as if he has an inside joke with the dog this guy
mariachi climbs over the counter and stands next to the clerk
the clerk things mariachi is a lunatic
mariachi holds up a finger as if cueing the clerk for a demonstration
mariachi then leaps over the counter landing firmly back on the other side of the counter
closeup of his feet landing hard just as before
the register opens
mariachi shrugs smiles and reaches into the register taking his money out himself
he counts it
after a brief consideration he decides to leave the old man a tip
mariachi waves a good bye wave and dances out
the old man still standing there with his arms outstretched as if he was robbed dashes to the phone and calls mocos men
the bar assistant is cleaning the bar
he walks over to grab a few glasses and when he returns azul is sitting at the barstool mariachi was on earlier
the assistant looks around wondering where azul appeared from
can i get something to drink or eat
the assistant grabs a mug and starts to fill it at the tap
he fills it halfway when
in a bottle wey
he grabs a bottle and hands it to azul then lifts the mug toasts and drinks it straight down
azul drinks his straight down too
looking around isnt there a girl that works here
yeah she owns the place
heading a few bills to the assistant
she owns it now
then she is mocos girl
looking around so so
shes onto this new musician
azul takes out a few more bills and hands them to the assistant and begins to stand up
mariachi is out on the streets returning to dominos
as he crosses the street he notices azul leaving the saloon with a guitar case
mariachi runs into the saloon
mariachi runs inside and checks to see if his case is still there
domino comes downstairs
i just saw a guy with a guitar case like mine
its him they want
to assistant did he say anything
nodding no he just ordered a drink
i dont look anything like him
azul is walking to his truck when he turns to a corner and mean dude sticks his gun in his face
two more guns appear pointed at the back of his head
is this the guy
im not sure
the two rats are in the blue truck half a block away
one hits the other to look at whats happening to azul
pov of rats seeing azul with three guys around him with guns
they look at each other start the truck and speed away
whats in the case
youre one of those old time mariachis huh
ok lets take a look
mean dude takes the case and lays it flat in azuls palms
if its a guitar like you say it is well never bother you again
mean dude unsnaps two of the latches snap snap
if its not
he unsnaps three more
then well spray paint this street with your brains
he points the gun deep into azuls face and cocks it
azul closes his eyes
mean dude lifts the lid
azul hears a faint strumming sound followed by the sound of the mean dude slamming the case shut
azul opens his eyes
the mean dude resnaps the latches
snap snap snap
walking away sorry
they walk away leaving azul wondering what happened
domino mariachi and assistant are standing at the bar
look as long as you dont carry the case around theyll leave you alone
its that guy theyre after
putting on his coat i better put this upstairs
he grabs the case and begins to take it to the stairs but he pauses for it feels different to him
he slowly looks down at it
azul watches the mean dudes go and when tey turn the corner he puts the case on the ground to open it
the mean dudes are rounding the corner but mean dude who is last snaps his fingers and motions to the others to keep quiet and to watch azul mariachi shakes
the case and puts it on the counter as if to open it
but he doesnt need to check it
he knows its not his guitar
mariachi looks at her startled then runs out of the bar with the case
mean dudes are watching azul unsnap his case
azul opens the lid revealing mariachis guitar
the mean dudes start walking towards azul as the camera tracks back with them
azul slams the case shut wondering what the hell is going on
he looks up and notices the mean dudes walking towards him
he stands up and slowly walks in the other direction
mariachi is running through the streets and onto the sidewalk
the bad guys are pulling out their weapons
mariachi bolts around the corner
now everyone is on the same sidewalk
mariachi and azul are on each end of the street with the mean dudes in between them
azul turns and sees mariachi with his guitar case
mean dude turns and sees mariachi too
the two other mean dudes exchange glances
mean dude stalks after mariachi so the other two follow
mariachi looks to azul for help
azul tips the imaginary hat to mariachi and walks away
mariachi runs through the street almost getting hit
bullets are flying as the mean dudes are firing at him as they run
mariachi leaps up over a few cars and ends up in a dead end
he turns around drops the case on the ground and opens it
a million weapons seem to stare back at him when he opens it
he is frantic
he grabs a small gun shakes it in his hand doesnt like the feel
he tosses it back in
the mean dudes are barreling down the street
one turns towards the dead end
mariachi pulls out the mac and blasts the first mean dude he sees
he grabs the case and runs out into the street jumping onto a truck and blasting the other mean dude from up there
he sees mean dude run away
mariachi comes off the truck and walks through the streets in slow motion
peolple are staring at him as if he was azul the killer
mariachi walks straight to the bar
a boy is bouncing a ball on one of the sidewalks
the camera dollies past the vacant pool table and over to a rat sitting in a chair drinking a beer
the other rat is pacing back and forth in front of the sitting rat
azul enters the room
throwing his guitar case onto the pool table as a grand entrance gesture
the sitting rat stands beside the pacing rat
im sorry we left
we didnt know what to do
we figured you could defend yourself
rat nods in agreement
azul unsnaps one of the latches
you thought i could defend myself
against three armed men
he opens the case and the guitar sparkles at them
the rats exchange glances
they look at the guitar then back at azul
my case got switched with some maricon mariachi
where is this mariachi
hes dead by now
so i want you to go look for my case
the two rats are about to leave
leave me a weapon
both rats take out their guns
azul takes rat s gun
that was disloyal of you to leave me out there
you should be as loyal to me as you are to each other
the rats exchange glances then aim their eyes back to the floor
azul turns to rat
are you loyal
after glancing at rat yes
to rat are you loyal
azul gestures to rat
then shoot him
rat turns to rat who is in shock
you are loyal are you not
or i shoot you
azul aims his gun at rat who immediately aims his gun at rat
rat is sweating bullets
rat puts his gun down
you said we should be as loyal to you as we are to each other
i couldnt shoot him for that would be as disloyal as shooting you
rat glances back and forth between rat and azul
now go find my case
azul puts his gun down and motions the rats to leave
when they exit rat turns to rat and snaps his fingers
rat shakes his hand
domino is dabbing hydrogen peroxide onto a cotton swab
she applies it to mariachis body scars on his back
mariachi has his eyes closed
he washes the blood from his face
where were you when he came into the bar
i was on the phone talking to a friend that knows whats going on
did you mention me
he told me the man in black is azul
if his name is azul why doesnt he wear blue
i dont know
anyway hes killing the men of the town drug dealer
the dealers name is mauricio
but hes known as moco
and moco is sending these men to find azul
so why do they chase me
they have never seen azul
only moco knows him
my friend says the description moco gave his men was that he wears black and carries a guitar case
sounds like you no
couldnt you tell your friend that there are two people like that in his town
one is a killer and one is a mariachi
only special people can talk to moco
besides youve killed a few of his men now
your best option is to keep out of sight stop wearing black and to hide that stupid case until this is all over
mean dude comes in and approaches moco
he got away
but i got a good look at him
moco takes out a cigarette and puts it in his mouth
coca caca beto were killed
moco takes out a match
he wont get away again moco
moco lights his match across mean dude s face and lights his cigarette
mean dude walks away as moco flicks his match at him in slow motion
mariachi is about to lay on the floor
she tosses him a blanket
are you always closed monday nights or did you close since i cant play my guitar tonight
mondays are my day off
want to play a game
the phone rings
domino gets up to answer it
mariachi reaches under his blanket for a small mirror and combs his hair putting spit in his hair to slick it down
he quickly stashes the mirror
into phone hello
into phone come see me
into phone i cant
into phone please
moco is sitting at a table playing cards
into phone i dont feel well
ive got to go
into phone have you ridden the bike
into phone no

she hangs up
quiet as if thinking no
i cant figure out something
you tell me youre poor
yet youve got this place
sighing this place is a gift
the man trying to kill me
hes not trying to kill you his man had you confused with azul
look you now how if you want to impress a girl you send her flowers candy jewelry until you win her love
if one present doesnt work you keep sending bigger and better things until you win her or youre broke
well mauricio sent me flowers then jewelry then he gave me a job at his saloon then he gave me the whole saloon
hes still giving you things
hell never run out of money
and you accept it all
whats the last thing he sent you
domino walks over to the counter and picks up a key
he wants me to ride out to his ranch when ive decided to be his
he thinks hes close to having me
pause he was
she sits next to mariachi
she gets up and is about to turn off the lights
so you really are from a poor family
in the dark i remember when i was growing up we were so poor that my brothers and sisters and i all slept on the same blanket stretched out across
we had to sleep in a circle with our fingers in each others ears to keep the bugs from crawling into them
after a pause ay wey
domino hands mariachi a wad of money
mariachi sees the money and looks up at her bewildered
heres a little bit ive saved
i want you to go get a new guitar
mariachi starts to put up his hand as if to refuse it
take it stupid
im not saying go by the best one just a temporary one so you can play again tonight
mariachi stops and thinks
he looks up at her questioningly then he shrugs an ok and grabs the money and jogs out excitedly
domino is smiling
mariachi walks down the sidewalk passing curioso shops
the camera is low and zoomed in all the way
mariachi stops by one of the window that has a guitar in the glass
he pulls his money and counts it
he stops after he notices someones reflection in the window
he turns around and sees it is mean dude right across the street
he meets up with another mean dude
they are standing right behind mariachi
mariachi is pretending to still look at the window
the mean dudes walk past mariachi so mariachi walks in the opposite direction
mean dude stops and then turns around slowly
far zoomed shot of mariachi walking down the street with guys behind him
they start after him
tracking shot following mariachi
tracking shot in front of mean dudes walking at mariachi
mean dude pulls out a small walkie talkie and calls his buddy in the truck a block away
into walkie talkie loco hes headed your way
black pants white shirt
loco starts the truck and starts driving slowly across the street
as he turns on the corner mariachi sees the truck and casually climbs inside and hides in the back
mean dude turns the corner when whispers into walkie talkie
into walkie talkie where did he go loco
laughs into walkie talkie he got in my truck
mean dude laughs
into walkie talkie take him around the block
mean dude taps his buddy and they start running down the block
mariachi is in back the truck searching for a weapon
the truck stops
mariachi rolls to the side and gently lifts his head
pov mariachi sees the two mean dudes walking at him
mariachi turns and loco is there to knock him in the face with the rifle butt
mariachi falls into truck blood trickling from his dizzying head
he tries to get up a bit but loco is in the truck now and slams the rifle down into his face hard
mariachi is unconcious in the back of locos truck
mean dude and other mean dudes are riding in back with mariachi
the above scene intercuts back and forth with the arrival of loco
loco arrives at the gate mean dude opens the gate they drive through
the truck is facing moco so he cant see mariachi yet
mean dude closes the gate and walks over to the truck opens the back door and calls moco over
moco walks over to the truck and looks inside
mariachi is laying there unconcious moco puts his arm around mean dude who is looking very proud and moco pulls out a cigarette and a match
thats not him
moco strikes the match behind mean dude s head
mean dude stops smiling
domino is waiting on customers
she glances at her watch
a few seconds later she glances at it again
she looks very worried
azuls rats burst into the hideout
four girls pop up over the partition with guns
the rats stop in their tracks
the girls sigh a oh its them sigh and slink back to bed
top shot of them trying to wake azul
azul wakes up and looks over the partition
wheres my case
we couldnt find it
we heard they caught you and were taking you to mocos ranch
so we came to see if it was true
azul thinks a moment
he stands up
they caught the mariachi
azul dresses smiling
mariachi is in a holding cell at the ranch
he twitches finally waking up
he sees a guard outside and finds a way to escape
he grabs the guards assault rifle and turns a corner
two men grab him
he slams the butt of the rifle knocking the wind and teeth out of bad guy then he kicks down and breaks the shin bone of bad guy who screams
out in agony
mariachi silences him by karate punching his throat
the bad guy gurgles and hits the ground
angle from the ground as mariachi smashes the guy with is gun
he crawls up a wall trying to escape as quietly as he can
he sees two more men running towards him since they heard some noise
mariachi aims his assault rifle at the blue chevy parked behind him
he fires and it explodes
mariachi jumps loco gets him to drive him to the saloon
he also takes locos money
azul walks into frame looks around then proceeds into the bar
azul goes inside and finds domino tending the bar
what can i get you
she grabs a bottle and slams it down on the counter unopened
he eyes her admirably and then pops the top with one hand
he guzzles the drink slamming it down empty
nodding my guitar case
wheres my case
domino grabs another beer for him and runs to get the case
in between this time mariachi escapes with loco
she returns slamming it to the floor
if you want your mariachi back come with me
why will you help me
because you know where mocos ranch is
domino calls her assistant
you help me ill help you
the assistant tends to the bar
they drive out to mocos ranch in azuls truck
little do they know they passed locos truck with mariachi crouched in the passenger seat
he gets up after the truck passes
mariachi didnt know it was domino in azuls truck or he could have turned around and kept her from going to mocos ranch
they arrive at the gate and het out of the truck
over the gate mauricio
azul grabs domino and points a gun to her head
he whispers to her
he kicks at the gate
open the gate or shes dead
the gate opens and we see moco standing at a three quarter stance flanked with his men on both sides
azul drags domino in and faces her at moco with a gun to her head
to domino im sorry he used you to get to me domino
azul cocks the pistol
azul let her go and youll get your money
moco give me my money or i ruin your clothes with her blood
moco signals his men to get the money
what have you done with mariachi
the musician your men confused with azul
staring at her so thats why you were busy that night
azul is glancing between domino and moco
you had that little monkey climbing all over you
give me my money or i kill her now
after all ive done for you this is how you treat me
i never asked you for anything until now
let mariachi go
azul is anxious now
i swear ill kill her
no you wont
moco pulls out his gun and shoots her in the heart
she falls limp in azuls arms
azul tries hold her up but shes dead
azul rests her on the ground looking down at her wondering why its all come to this
all i wanted was my rightful share
but youve got to kill everybody
you feel sorry for her dont you
see thats why you cant ever be as big as me
azul slowly looks at moco
aiming gun because you have too much heart
moco shoots azul in the heart
azul had his hands to his side and now he falls to his knees
moco shoots him again and azul dies next to domino
mean dude is exchanging glances with the others
no one seems to be on mocos side
mariachi is still in locos truck
loco stops the truck and mariachi gets out
loco drives back when mariachi motions for him to leave
mariachi watches him go then dashes around the corner to the saloon
mariachi runs into the bar
the assistant rushes over to mariachi
where is she
looking for you
mariachi is about to race upstairs
she gave the case back to that guy
she left with him to find you
mariachi tries to make sense of it all for a minute before grabbing the gun from under the counter and rushing upstairs
dominos loft day mariachi grabs the key to the motorcycle and runs out
the motorcycle burns down the road
mariachi barrels down the road on the motorcycle
moco is walking away from the bodies
bring that musician out here so he can be reunited with my domino
some men go to check
cut back and forth with mariachi coming
hes gone sir
mariachi rides through the semi open gate
stopping at the bodies
he dismounts the bike and holds domino
he has the gun in the back of his pants
you can see it while his back is to the camera and men are approaching him
moco comes for the show
good shot so youre the little mariachi that came to town killed my men and stole my girl
mariachi slowly lifts his eyes to moco
you are very talented
mariachi stands hands up
i bet you play the guitarra real well huh
mariachi says nothing
raising gun not anymore
moco fires into mariachis left hand
mariachi grimaces crumbling to the floor
he keeps a tight grip on his hand
when he opens his hand to see the damage the camera can see right through his hand for a reverse shot of his face through the hole
now get the hell off my property and take your hand with you
moco is laughing and looking at his men for support but no one else laughs
mariachi tries to stand but he falls back
when he rises again he has the gun in his hand
he shoots moco in the chest
moco falls back and hits the ground hard
he gasps for air
mocos men gather around him
mean dude crouches down to check mocos throat pulse
mean dude strikes a match across mocos face and lights up a cigarette
he turns and walks away
the others follow
mariachi wraps a tourniquet on his arm kisses domino opens azuls case sees the weapons and rides off with it
he looks back at the town behind him then places his hand on the motorcycle to drive off
we notice the metal brace on his hand
mariachi rides into the sunset road
