written by mike judge march an idyllic american factory
theres a huge long lawn in front
a reynolds extract sign in brick with flowers landscaping around it sits near the entrance
we see from the number of cars in the parking lot that its a company of about employees
we are in a manufacturing area of an assembly line production
its a big room full of intricate machines huge vats of different colored extract and other food flavoring products conveyor belts bottling machines etc
it has a high ceiling with offices on the second floor that have big windows overlooking this manufacturing area
we pan up to the main office
joel reynolds head of the company mid thirties is on the phone with his friend dean
you should come by tonight
half price well drinks while the games going
you always give me free drinks though
well come by anyway
might as well
no action going on at my house thats for sure
the wife out of town
i just havent been laid in a month
you guys having problems or something
this is pretty much normal these days
as credits continue camera pulls out back down to the manufacturing area past a big vat of orange extract down through various stages of assembly line production then follows several
bottles of orange extract moving past hector a mexican immigrant employee in his thirties
the camera stops on him
talking to hector is step a short beady eyed charles manson looking guy with a beard and mustache
step is in his forties
he makes everything he says sound as macho and important as possible
you get this job through manpower
i started here with manpower too
started out on the line just like you
only i did better
crates a day
hector is not quite sure what hes talking about
step continues telling his tale in such a way that the only polite reaction would be one of total amazement
im the best sorter in here
thats why they made me full time with benefits
ill probably be floor manager this year
a few feet away we see rory a stocky indie rock geek with too many tatoos hair shaved on the side with a ponytail lots of bad piercings wearing baggy
shorts with lots of pockets and some kind of gothy t shirt a look that ought to be out of style by now
rory is putting stickers on boxes with a sticker gun
he flips the sticker gun around unnecessarily between each application adding a few unnecessary moves motions slapping each box when hes done generally making the activity look like more of
a skill than it actually is
he approaches step and hector pulling out some fliers from his many pockets
hands them each a flier my bands playing this friday come check us out
hector looks down at the flier
its xeroxed with fifties clip art cut out letters and the name of the band gods cock
hector just looks at it confused not knowing much english not sure what hes supposed to be doing with the flier
at the end of the line where boxes are loaded onto pallets sits mary years old wearing a year old pair of acid wash jeans and an oversized tweety bird
t shirt fanny pack and dayglow yellow triangle shaped earrings
shes pear shaped with short hair
shes bitter and bossy always shaking her head at everyone
she sits on a stool with a clipboard looks over her glasses at hector shaking her head
she talks to gabriella a hispanic woman in her forties
you see that
that new guy
hes holding us up
its not my job to tell them to hold the line either
and then joels gonna come yell at us cuz hes not doing his job
folds her arms fed up im just gonna sit here
youre not gonna shut it off
im not gonna hold the line
if theyre not gonna do their job why should i do mine
mary sits there arms folded lips pursed refusing to pause the conveyor belt
joel is still on the phone with dean
if i dont get home before about she puts on the sweatpants and once the sweatpants are on its over i get nothing
notices something down shit
im gonna have to call you back
joel hangs up and runs downstairs
boxes start to accumulate and fall off the end of the line
step sees this runs to shut off the line yelling at mary
what are you doing
what are you doing
pointing at hector what is he doing
a yelling bickering match breaks out between mary step rory and gabriella
joel runs over shuts off the conveyor belt
now whats the problem
they all erupt in more bickering and finger pointing
okay everyone settle down
hector here is new okay
its gonna take him a couple of days maybe his english isnt so good
you gotta be patient
thats what i was tryin to say
and step if you wanna be floor manager this is the kind of thing youre going to have to deal with
okay now step rory hector lets get this cleaned up and get rolling again
we cant afford to fall behind today
joel walks away
people resume their posts
mary starts right back up with gabriella
you see that
we always get the blame
joel sits in his swivel chair looking down at the production floor shaking his head
brian joels second in command walks in
hes a little older than joel neatly trimmed beard aviator glasses and a bit of a gut
he wears a reynolds extract golf shirt and khaki pants
he walks over to the window joins joel looking down at the employees
theyre like a bunch of goddamned children
tell me about it
sorry i missed the drama i was showing boy genius down there how to back up a forklift
angle on rory driving the forklift handing out a flier as he passes someone
thats his whole career driving that damn forklift
youd think hed wanna learn how
well i guess hes got that band hes in too
disgust at the word band ugh
ill bet dollars to donuts he sucks at that too
then you got ah
tries to remember her name but cant dinkus down there
no the other one whats her face she asked me or rather axed me for more personal days
just like that
i told her maybe if she figures out how to fill out the time sheets correctly ill give her more personal days
off joels look dont worry she will never fill out her time sheets correctly
joel looks down at the production floor
joels pov angle on mary and step bickering
step walks off
mary and gabrielle shaking their heads and yapping like a couple of old hens
look at em
i am so sick of baby sitting these assholes
looks at his watch i better get going
joel leaves in a hurry mumbling something about sweatpants
joel drives home in a hurry checking his dashboard clock
its an upscale neighborhood of mcmansions in a town like lincoln nebraska
he turns a corner slows down suddenly when he sees something
nathan a middle aged overweight annoying guy is going out to the street to get his mail
to himself praying please go back inside
please just turn around
dont notice me
its too late
nathan turns sees joels car and waves then crosses the street to joels driveway and waits to talk to him
joel pulls into his driveway as nathan flags him down
joel begrudgingly rolls down the passenger side window so nathan can talk to him
hi there joel
glad i caught ya
nathan settles in like hes going to be there a while leaning with his arms folded hanging inside the car trapping joel
howve ya been
i left you a message last week
i dont know if you got it or not
yeah actually nathan im kind of in a hurry here
you been busy
yeah in fact
checks his watch i should go right now actually
i gotta call the office before they leave

yeah november th
youll be in town then right
theres this dinner leslie and i are going to
its an annual thing we do it every year with the rotary club its for charity
its just a whole lot of fun and we wanted to invite you and suzie to be our guests at our table
its im sorry i ah
i just dont think thats something were gonna want to do
its a lot of fun
oh i dont know
suzie doesnt really like going to stuff like why not
well we wouldnt know anybody there
she gets kind of uncomfortable
oh no its not like that
she wont be uncomfortable
i guarantee it
no its not like that at all
its not formal or anything
its just a real loose bunch
i just dont
i tell you what
why dont we do this ill go ahead and get tickets since theyre gonna sell out fast
you talk to suzie
see what she says
like i say she wont be uncomfortable at all
maybe ill have leslie give her a call you know how it is when the wives talk heh heh joel is about to snap
um why dont we talk about this later
looks at his watch i gotta make this call before they leave
joel pulls away forcing nathan to raise off the window sill
i just gotta make this call
joel pulls the car in steps out and is shocked to see nathan right there in his garage
sorry i almost forgot the tickets are forty dollars a plate
i know thats a little steep but the food is fantastic and its for a good cause
so thatd be eighty dollars total
theres no tax or anything
ah look nathan i really gotta get inside and make this call
lets talk about this another time
joel has his finger on the button to shut the garage door waiting for nathan to get out
nathan stops just inside
oh and if you need us to look out for the house or anything when you go out of town joels finger still on the garage door button
well just let us know
where you guys going anyway
ah just sort of a vacation
look i gotta run
joel hits the button and the door starts going down
well see ya
nathan finally steps out of the garage
joel breaths a huge sigh of relief
then as it gets halfway down we see nathans legs heading back towards the door
nathan leans down into frame as the door goes down
oh joel one more thing joel lets the door shut on him and bolts into the house
joel walks into the living room just as his wife suzie enters from the bedroom pulling on her sweatpants
a look of disappointment on joels face
suzie is a decent looking woman about joels age
man that nathan wont shut up
yeah what an asshole
i dont even go into the front yard anymore
that wife of his is even worse
suzie plops down on the couch looking tired and pissed off
joel sits down next to her
we gotta get a new pool cleaner
i dont think that asshole checked the chlorine levels again like i asked him too
joel puts his arm around her caresses her shoulder
she doesnt seem to notice as he starts getting fresh
and every time he is here he goes on and on about some problem with the goddamn filter and i have no idea what hes talking about
delayed reaction she notices joel is getting frisky
he gets closer starts kissing her neck
im a little tired and i dont know its the middle of the week
its not the middle of the week
why cant monday
freezes suddenly oh shit
suzie jumps up with newfound energy runs for the remote and turns on the tv
joel just sits there
suzie plops down in a barcalounger
maybe this weekend
joel leaves the room
quick scene of joel trying to masturbate off screen of course but hes too distracted by the sounds of a bad out of tune idol audition blaring through the wall
a sports bar thats part of a holiday inn
joel sits at the bar
dean the owner of the bar late forties and an old friend of joels sits behind the bar on a stool
i gotta get a house with a bathroom thats doesnt share a wall with the tv
why dont you do that in another bathroom
youve got three of em
it would look suspicious
we never use those other bathrooms
maybe if i had some insulation put in
all i know is you shouldnt move man youve got a nice house
i mean youve got the american dream really you own your own company
i cant believe you used to bar back for me here and now youve got all that
but what do i have really
its a big pain in the ass
im always working cant stop or the whole place will fall apart
and what good does it do me anyway
i dont get laid
that stock guy with the shitty band that works for me probably gets laid more than i do
trying to help yeah but he probably lives in a crappy apartment
hell id move into a crappy apartment if the bathroom wasnt right next to the tv
cindy a girl in her early twenties is at the counter looking at a new gibson hollow body electric guitar one of the really nice ones
the price tag says
shes beautiful and sexy and all that but theres something vulnerable and sweet about her as well
two salesmen typical music store employees long haired goateed nerdy cocky guitar hacks are giving her way too much attention
its clear that they dont usually have women this hot in their store
they practically stumble over each other trying to help her
yeah its expensive but its sweet
are you familiar with the gibson humbucking pickups
i dont play
its for my dad actually for his fiftieth birthday
my sisters and i are all pitching in
ah thats nice
your dad would love these humbuckings
they really kick ass
an annoyed male customer has been waiting behind cindy trying to get some help but he might as well be invisible
he tries to address salesman off to the side
i just have a quick question
salesman is oblivious never takes his eyes off cindy
so what kind of music did he play
both salesmens eyes are glued to cindy as male customer finally gets sick of waiting and storms off into the keyboard room
i think he played like jazz or something
im not sure
well this is an excellent jazz guitar
its what pat metheny plays
is your dad into metheny at all
oh i dont know who that is
hes like a totally kickass fusion guitarist
are you into fusion
i dont really know much about it
i play fusion guitar so
um do they come in any other colors
you mean different finishes
theres a sunburst finish we might have in stock
yeah do you wanna see it
ill go get it
or i could go
are you sure
ill show you the case it comes with too
the salesmen practically trip over each other going into the back to find the other guitar
cindy stands there alone for a beat
she looks around
then casually picks up the four thousand dollar guitar and walks out the front door with it
cindy walks a few yards over to her car a tercel puts the guitar in the trunk gets in and takes off
the two salesmen return one carrying the sunburst finish guitar and the other with the hard shell case
they look around notice shes gone
they stand there for a beat disappointed before they realize what just happened
they run out the front door but cindy is long gone
joel is at his desk
brian comes in excited
youre not gonna believe this
remember the guy from general mills that called a while back
talking like he wanted to buy us out
i thought you said he wasnt serious he was just sniffing around
yeah well hes serious now
he just made an offer i mean a real offer this time
it must be part of some bigger strategic move because its over market value i think
joel lets it sink in
he walks over to the window looking down on the production floor
i could unload all this
i could probably retire
i mean yeah theres a lot of details to work out but this could be great
theyll be calling back next week what should i tell them
joel looks down sees mary sitting with her arms folded shaking her head
tell em hell yes
mary sits with her arms folded refusing to hold the line
i already warned him
this is the last time
im just gonna sit here
in slow motion we see
the first box falls off the end of the assembly line bottles shatter
rory carrying some boxes slips on the broken bottles of goopey extract falls and slides into an aisle
a forklift stops suddenly to avoid hitting rory causing a huge stack of pallets to fall off
quick shot of mary shaking her head in slow motion
just as step rounds a corner to see whats going on the pallets land on a bunch of pipes and high pressure valves which burst open sending a piece of
shrapnel flying across the room heading straight for steps crotch
the shrapnel heads straight for his genitalia as we step is on a stretcher being loaded into a medivac helicopter by a couple of ems guys
step moans in pain as joel tries to comfort him
a small crowd of employees watch
angle on mary in the crowd shaking her head
i knew it
thats what happens when you dont pay attention
joel sits at the bar on a cell phone
dean sits behind the bar on a stool
to the person on the uh huh
let me know if you hear anything else
he hangs up talks to dean
well hes definitely lost one of em
they think they might be able to re attach the other one but theyre not sure
shaking his head wow
im not sure how it happened but we have a great safety record and we comply with all the safety codes so
it was just a freak accident
therell be an investigation of some kind im sure
well you have insurance for that kind of thing right
in fact hell probably get a huge settlement
i would think so
i mean its your balls
beat as they contemplate the profundity of it
boy it really makes you stop and think about how fragile we are especially our balls
theyre just hanging there in a little sack between our legs
at any moment they could be cut off forever
and your balls are really important man
your balls are everything
what kind of life would you have with no testicles
can you imagine that shit
you know dean my life wouldnt be much different than it is now actually
except for once every three months when i have sex with my wife
in fact i might even be better off
i thought you said it was once a month
i mustve been lying
i dont know
maybe thingsll get better when i sell the company
ill be around more
well i hope so
that would suck
i get laid all the time
off joels reaction sorry
ah its all right
actually it sucks
yeah sexual frustration is bad news
you know what you oughtta do
get some xanax
isnt that for anxiety
yeah it is but i find its good for just about any phsychological problem
i mean basically it just makes you feel good so it sort of works for anything
i even take it when i have a cold
its probably great for sexual frustration
want me to get you some
you know what else is good
codeine cough syrup
its just good
joel looks at dean for a beat
are you on something now
well i guess i took some vicodin this morning
but that was just cause i was hung over
establishing shot a pawn shop in a strip mall
cindys car parked out in front
cindy is at the counter the gibson guitar we saw earlier is in front of her
a pawn shop guy is counting out money
he pauses looks around then speaks sympathetically to her
um you know im really not supposed to say this
but since this belonged to your father and since he passed away and all
you could probably get a better deal at a music store
oh thats okay
but i just kind of wanna get it over with you know
its kind of hard for me
he looks around to see if his boss is watching then counts off a few more twenties feeling sorry for her
pawn shop guy contd here
cindy puts the money in her wallet along with a drivers license
cindy shuffles through three or four different drivers licenses
on one her name says misty patterson
its a kansas license
she takes another one out from colorado with the name cindy metzler on it and puts that in front then puts the wallet away
a newspaper sits on the front seat
something grabs her attention
we see an article about steps accident
theres a picture of step being taken away on the stretcher
cindy starts reading the article with growing interest
she scans the article zeroing in on certain words
potentially big settlement
several million dollars then back to no testicles then quickly back and forth several times million dollars no testicles million dollars no testicles on cindys face a look of determination
she looks one more time at the name under the picture don step wilkenson then zeroes in on the words reynolds extract
she starts the car and speeds away
joel sits with brian
brian has a clipboard going over the days business
so obviously steps not coming back anytime soon
i had to hire a couple temps
is that okay
how is step
they say hes going home in a couple of days
speaking of which the guys at general mills heard about this whole step thing
if step decides to sue us beyond the insurance settlement it could be a serious liability
they dont want to make an offer until this thing has settled
they think its that big of a liability
i mean think about it
imagine if you asked a bunch of jurors how much youd have to pay em to cut their balls off
i mean i wouldnt let someone cut my balls off for a billion dollars
seriously unless there were some kind of really expensive operation that could give you artificial balls or something
no i guess not
anyway i wouldnt worry
he says hes not going to sue us
says he dont want somethin fer nothin and whats right is right
if we can just get him to sign something to that effect we should be fine
boy step sure is being mellow about all this
yeah well i think when you lose your balls it mellows you out
you dont get as pissed off and aggressive about things
i know its true for horses and bulls
boy it sure does make you think
oh by the way guess who asked for a raise today
to someone downstairs dinkus
can you believe that
brian you call everyone here dinkus
i dont know who youre talking about
you know forklift dinkus
i thought you call him boy genius
yeah well boy genius asked for a raise
i said are you kidding
you nearly got someone killed last week and then he blamed it on dinkus over there
you know brian you really ought to learn the employees names
well i was thinking about that but hey if this deal goes through next week i wont have to
its not like im gonna be inviting dinkus and boy genius over for dinner
joel stands on one side of his office looking down through a long window overlooking the manufacturing area
dean comes in walks over to the window looks down at the production floor with joel
whats goin o whoa
deans pov its cindy now working down on the floor on the assembley line
is she new
shes a temp
shes a tramp
no a temp
damn shes hot
way to go
hey i didnt hire her
she came here through manpower like everybody else
they just sent her over
maybe i should give them a call
you dont usually have girls anywhere near that hot working here
whats the deal
yeah i know
i guess it makes sense though if you think about it
hot girls need a job just as much as anyone else
thinks for a second do they really
you just dont see em here
usually your temps look like winos
and theyre guys
you wanna hear something really weird
she came on to me
i mean im pretty sure
i could be wrong but
hey im sure she did
are you kidding
you could have any girl down there
i dont know about that
dude youre the big shot here
youre the king of
what do you call that shit you make here again
and spray dried flavoring and were branching out yeah youre the extract king man
you could have any girl here
i mean i wouldnt want most of em but her
way to go joel
dean looks down at manufacturing area taking it all in
so how did she come on to you
well first she started asking me about what happened to step and all that stuff you know just sort of making conversation
but it really seemed like she was flirting with me you know
then she just sort of asked me out
well you see that guy down there by the fork lift
angle on rory the indi rock guy with tattoos etc
his band is playing somewhere at some party this weekend and she asked me if i wanted to go with her
so you gonna do anything about it
i couldnt live with myself if i cheated on suzie
itd be nice if i got laid at home once in a while though
still staring at her man she is fine
you mind if i hit that then
yeah i do sort of
we see a commotion down on the floor
mary runs out of the womens locker room screaming and yelling
mary runs over to where hector is working hysterical
my purse is stolen
pointing at hector he did it
he stole my purse
brian runs over and stands between them trying to calm mary down but she keeps ranting
hector looks confused and worried
now hold on i wont hold on
ill call the cops
confused frightened what
espera un momento hector
tu sabes donde esta su
angle on cindy watching the whole thing completely unfazed
joel rushes in
now wait a second
calm down mary
how do you know it was stolen
well what did it look like
it was black with a fur leopard style border
as mary describes the purse we cindy sits in her parked car going through the purse mary just described
she takes some cash puts it in her pocket then finds what shes looking for the address book
cindy turns to the ws and finds step wilkenson
she notes his address
she starts the car and takes off
cindy sits and waits listening to the radio
its a very blue collar neighborhood
shes about three houses away from steps house keeping an eye on it
after a beat step limps out of the house walks over to his pickup truck painfully gets in and leaves
cindy starts the car and follows from a distance
step wheels his shopping cart into one of the checkout lines
he uses the cart as a crutch to help him walk
cindy gets in line behind him
she only has one item a bottle of reynolds orange extract
step notices her
you can go ahead of me if thats all you have
thank you so much
holds up extract bottle i cant believe im buying this stuff i work at the factory
i work there too
or ah i used to
i just started there
whats your name
i go by step
yeah im the fastest sorter there
as cindy and step get to know each other we joel enters the living room
he first sees the sweatpants then sees suzie is sound asleep on the couch
he sighs then turns and leaves
joel sits at the bar talking to dean
joel is drinking some kind of hard liquor getting a buzz
im sick of it dean
im sick of being turned down in my own house by my own wife
were turning into one of those brother sister couples
now that you mention it you guys kind of look alike too
no we dont
takes a drink maybe things will be better after i sell the company
or maybe its just going to mean more time to sit around and contemplate not getting laid
dean nods sympathetically
what about that girl at work
she still into you
she was really coming on to me
she gave me her phone number and everything
told me to call her if i wanted to go to that party
can you believe that
and theres nothing i can do about it but just be sexually frustrated
ive got some xanax if you want it
like i say that always works for me
well maybe you should call that girl
no i cant
i cant cheat on suzie
i just gotta power through it until im so old that i cant get it up anymore
what about if suzie cheated on you
i hadnt even thought of that
i wish she would
you wish she would cheat on you
wouldnt that bother you
joel thinks about it
i dont think it would actually
occuring to him i guess thats weird huh
yeah its a little weird
but see then i could do something about all this sexual frustration without feeling guilty about it
do you think she would cheat on you
well i dont know
maybe if she were really tempted she would
like if some really studly guy came on to her
so youre saying she would probably cheat on you if she was put in temptations way
you know what you oughtta do
i dont wanna do any drugs dean
check this out if you really wish your wife would cheat on you its not that hard to make it happen
hire a gigolo to have an affair with your wife
i know a guy
you know a gigolo
how do you know a gigolo
this guy brad
he comes in here all the time
hes a friend of vics
you could hire him to have an affair with suzie
come on dean
you said you wouldnt care if she cheated on you
then youd be free to go out with that cindy chick and get your ya yas out with no guilt
proud of himself man what a great idea
joel just shakes his head at the whole thing
you know maybe i will try some of that xanax
dean reaches down under the cash register and whips out a little box and pulls out a pill
steps truck is parked out at a lake in the country
he and cindy sit next to each other on the tailgate looking at the stars talking
i just believe that whats right is right
thats right step and whats right is for you to send a message
you need to send a message so that a horrible accident like this never happens to anyone else ever again
thats whats right
and the way you do that is to take them to court
thats why i called a lawyer for you that guy on all the bus stop benches
you did that for me
i just want you to do whats right step
they start cuddling kissing
cindy pulls away
im sorry step your doctor said you shouldnt get aroused
no he didnt
maybe it was your lawyer but he talked to your doctor
and your doctor said its very important not to get aroused until after the trial
youre so good to me cindy
they start cuddling again
look step youre getting me turned on im getting you turned on
i better just go
joel is starting to look really tweaked as the drug alcohol combination begins to kick in
dean is examining a pill under the cash register light trying to read the small print
he looks concerned
do you remember what color that pill i gave you was
i dont think it was xanax
i think that mightve been ritalin
or special k
feeling the buzz ah who cares
its just that ah special k is a horse tranquilizer kinda has a weird effect when people take it but
well dont worry about it
you might not want to drink too much more though
beginning to slur his you know that thing you were talking about
about the gigolo
do you think it would be wrong to do that
i mean morally wrong
with full authority oh nooo
what could be morally wrong about it
i dont know
look if she doesnt want to go for it she doesnt have to
and if she does then shes the one who sinned and then its perfectly morally right for you to go out and boff whoever you want
yeah i guess youre right
i cant think of anything morally wrong about it either
and this guy hes a friend of yours
whats his name
you want me to give him a call
i dont know
its kinda weird even talking about it
look this is no big deal joel
i mean you cant lose
just say youre hiring him to come clean the pool or something
see what happens
if she doesnt go for it then at least you know youre doing the right thing by being faithful
yeah i guess youre right
i dont know
dean pours joel another drink
have another drink
think about it
you know what
why dont i just call brad and see what he has to say
what the hell
joel takes a big swig of liquor
dean and joel are talking with brad the gigolo
hes young blonde super good looking but clearly a complete airhead
joel looks really messed up now
so its two hundred dollars then
yeah two hundred
well yeah but dont forget im getting ten percent
what so youre a pimp now
i dont think theyre called pimps when its with male prostitutes okay
theres some other word for it its not a john but its something like that
besides im the one who hooked all this up
and dont worry cuz its coming out of brads money anyway
so its two hundred dollars then
two hundred and twenty
wait a minute um i have a question
brad looks at joel deeply concerned
so like are you gonna like watch or something
no no no
its not like that
i wont even be there
ill be at work
we already talked about this
brad looks blank like hes not getting it
what youll do is come to my house pretending to be the new pool cleaner
then you simply try to seduce my wife
if she doesnt respond you simply clean the pool and leave
its that simple
hold on brad for a long beat
so uh youre not gonna touch my ass or anything
try to pay attention okay
i will not be there
i will be at work
you come over to my house while im not there posing as the new pool cleaner and then try to seduce her
brad finally makes a breakthrough
oooh i see
i get it now
youre not even gonna be there
yeah thats right
this is gonna be great
remember she might not go for it brad starts to get a little too excited
yeah this is gonna be cool
i can hardly wait
hey man if you know anyone else who needs you know what i do like you know lonely housewives and shit maybe you could tell em about me you know
joel looks on with growing concern as brad cant seem to stop talking
cuz like i figure if i did a few jobs and i was like really good
then maybe theyd tell their friends you know and theyd give me a
what do you call those things
yeah yeah those things
then those women could tell more women and then itd be like i was like uh
then if i got enough of em maybe i could quit my landscaping job and do this full time
that would be awesome
cause i hate landscaping
i like getting laid a lot better and my boss is a total dick
joel and dean are at deans car trying to say goodbye to brad who still wont shut up
like i say if your wife has any housewife friends who might dean finally puts his foot down
okay youve said that a few times now brad
go on to your car
like i say goodnight brad
see you later
brad finally leaves
let me drive you home
youre in no condition to drive
joel stumbles into deans car
are you sure about this guy dean
he acts like hes never done this before
he does it all the time
he just gets a little excited sometimes
i dont know
he sure doesnt seem too bright
yeah well what do you excpect
hes a whore
a break room with a kitchen
joel is badly hungover
he looks like hes about to throw up as he reaches into the cupboard above the sink downs a couple of aspirin then drops some alka seltzer in to a
glass of water
cindy comes in
looks like you had one of those nights
where was i
joel nods tries to grin and look cool as he takes a sip of his alkaseltzer
then his eyes go wide he almost does a spit take as something suddenly dawns on him
he runs out of the room
joel grabs the phone and dials frantically
oh hey joel
thank god youre home
did that really happen last night
i mean did we go through with it with that gigolo stuff
as far as i know
what was i thinking
we gotta call it off
can you call that guy brad
tell him ill pay him anyway whatever just dont come over
god what was i thinking
sure ill call him
oh wait a second
i dont think i have his number
i thought you called him last night
yeah but i got his number from vic
well get it from him again
vic doesnt have a phone right now
ill try information
whats brads last name
its something like
i think its a mexican name
the guys got blonde hair and blue eyes
yeah i thought it was weird too a guy like that with a mexican last name
its like lopez or sanchez or something
joel looks at his watch
joel hangs up the phone and rushes out the door
brian walks in
joel we gotta talk
not now brian
ah yeah its kind of important kind of really important
its joel rushes past him
we follow joel as he rushes past his secretary
excuse me joel
theres a brad chavez on line one for you
i cant i joel stops suddenly
he said hes done with the job you guys talked about at your house
do you want me to take a message
joel looks pale
hes the ah pool cleaner
i better take that
joel goes back in his office
hold on brian confused
joel stares at the phone for a beat then picks it up
hey is this joel
hey its brad
mission accomplished dude
what do you mean
i mean it worked
she totally went for it
looks at his watch you werent even supposed to be there for another minutes
i forgot what time you guys said and i was so excited about it i just went over there
joel sits down freaked out
reality setting in so you mean she actually ah
it was easy
what do you mean easy
oh i dont mean easy like she was easy like she was a slut or anything
i just mean it wasnt hard to get her to
tell me how it happened
i wanna hear everything
well she let me in so i went back like i was cleaning the pool
as brads dopey narration continues we see the story hes telling
it plays out like a bad soft porn flick on cinemax
we see brad wiping the side of the pool with a rag
i dont know anything about pool cleaning so i was just faking it
she was in her bathing suit
suzie comes out and lies on one of the reclining chairs
so i struck up a conversation
this is a really nice house
is it your dads house
wow you look so young to be living in a house this nice
do you have any sunscreen
i forgot mine
brads dopey narration comes back in
i thought that was pretty smart of me to ask her to borrow sunscreen
see cuz that way once she gave me some i could ask her if she wanted some too and rub some on her back instead of just coming out and
asking her to rub some on her
pretty smooth huh
we see brad rubbing lotion on suzies back as she lies face down on the chair
once i was rubbing the sunscreen on her the rest was easy
we see brads hands working their way down suzies back
just as they start to move down towards her butt joel interrupts yanking us out of the flashback
okay thats enough
i dont need to hear anymore
hey like i say if you know of anyone else or if you ever need me to do it again no
look i gotta go
joel hangs up the phone and falls back into his chair in a state of shock
quietly to himself holy shit
joel drives home from work
he still looks freaked out
he notices something ahead and suddenly slams on the breaks
joels pov nathan the guy across the street is in his front yard puttering around with the mail
joel puts the car in reverse starts to pull behind a parked car in an attempt to hide but nathan notices him waves and crosses the street
joel reluctantly pulls ahead to his driveway
hows it goin
oh im kind of busy actually
well i wont keep you
i just wanted to let you know i got those tickets to that dinner we talked about on the th
i think i told you they were forty dollars a piece but it turns out its a tad more this year fifty five so if i could go ahead and
just get a check from you guys
look ah we cant go
no this is the th
you said youre going out of town on the th
yeah but remember i told you we didnt really want to go to this thing
nathan looks dumbfounded
joel is about to snap
but i already bought the tickets
i know you said something about her feeling uncomfortable but like i say she wont feel uncomfortable at all i guarantee it
its just a whole lot of fun
you guysll have a great time
look i gotta get going
joel starts to pull away
oh one more thing joel just keeps driving almost knocking nathan over
joel and suzie are eating dinner
suzie has a glow about her looking better than ever relaxed satisfied etc
joels has a quietly pissed off demeanor
they eat in silence for a beat
suzie looks a little puzzled
they keep eating in silence for a beat
i dont feel well
im going to bed
from the window in his office joel watches cindy working down on the production floor
cindy looks up they make eye contact for a brief moment
she gives him a flirtacious wave
joel waves back
then rory comes by starts talking to cindy
so youre in a band
actually im in five bands right now
but godscock is basically the same four guys as fighthead but fightheads more of a thrash skatepunk thing
godscock is more melodic stuff
cindy nods politely
rory thinks shes interested
so you comin friday
looks at her watch ooh i gotta go
angle on mary on the other side of the room watching them
she talks to gabriella
see there he goes again slowing us down
now shes a good sorter
they need to hire more people like her
shes so nice too
hector walks by
mary just shakes her head
i cant believe hes still working here
you know silvia cant find her wallet
thinks it was stolen
and guess who was in the locker room last
they both look at hector and shake their heads in disgust
you know i could get a job at southwest airlines
my niece works there
id get better benefits than we get here too
i could get a job at gemco
you think they would put up with this stuff at gemco
they run a tight ship
joels pov of mary and gabrielle yacking self righteously
joel looks on with disgust
brian steps in taps on the door
you got a second
i think we might have a big problem here
im not sure what happened but all of the sudden step says he doesnt want to settle anymore
i think he mightve talked to a lawyer
joel goes to his desk sits down
like i say general mills isnt going to make their offer official until this settles
joel considers this
i think step is just chest beating
he does this all the time
he gets all wound up talks big then he always backs down
and thats with his balls
its a bleak looking office with rows of cubicles
we pan past several cubicles where hardass parole officers meet with their parolees various gang bangers drug dealers junkies a hideous transvestite prostitute etc
as we pan each officer is giving them nothing this is your last chance you expect me to believe that
we continue past officers giving them nothing giving them nothing ending on a cubicle with cindy where a parole officer is giving cindy everything almost apologetic
im sorry to even bring this up but youre not living with the drug dealer anymore are you
cindys parole officer is a sad schlub of a guy about with bushy grey hair and a mustache he has a badge and a gun on his belt
im staying at extended stay until i can find a place
she smiles flirtatiously waves her key card
i really feel like ive turned my life around
thanks in large part to you
im just glad to see youre doing so well
ah one more thing i just need to ask you we had a little incident up in templeton a couple weeks back where someone stole an expensive guitar from a
someone who fit your description
you know anything about that
i was probably at work that day
look cindy you realize you cant screw up anymore right
i mean even something minor and you could go back to jail for a while this time
id hate to see that happen
well yeah but why would i steal a guitar
ive got no musical talent
im tone deaf
they both laugh
heh heh so am i
i cant carry a tune to save my life
cindy acts fascinated by parole officers lack of musical talent
he happily goes on about it forgetting about the guitar
yeah i could barely sing the star spangled banner in school
its the end of the workday
people walk to their cars
joel turns a corner and finds cindy right in front of him
oh hey cindy
you can just call me joel
so you going to the party tonight
right thats tonight
yeah i was thinking about it
are you going
maybe ill see you there
yeah i think ill probably go
do you have the directions
im not sure
here ill write it down just in cindy opens her purse
we see at least five wallets several watches jewelry etc
she takes out a pen and a piece of pink girly stationary and starts writing
ill also put my number on here
in case you want to call me some time if you want
joel blushes awkwardly like a junior high school kid
joel pulls into the driveway and is startled as he practically runs over nathan flagging him down
joel mutters obscenities as he reluctantly stops and rolls down the window
almost missed ya
i cant talk right now hey i noticed you guys got a new pool cleaner today
how is he
were thinking of changing services
look nathan i gotta
wait you mean yesterday dont you
the new pool cleaner
you saw him yesterday right
it was today
the new guy
whatd he look like
blonde haired kid about this high good looking
real good looking
you sure it was today
youre absolutely sure
i know it was today because i came home for lunch
i was gone all day yesterday
anyway you think i could go ahead and get that check from ya
like i say its dollars a plate so thatd be total
theres no tax
nathan leans up to scratch his back
joel seizes the opportunity and pulls away burning a little rubber
joel is on his cell phone yelling in hushed tones at brad
he has the door shut so suzie wont hear him
what the hell were you doing at my house today
look dont worry about it bro
i wont charge you for this one
wont charge me for
you had sex with my wife again
well i figured we already did it once so whats the big deal
i mean she said to stop by if i was in the neighborhood so
besides im not gonna charge you not gonna charge
god damn you
yes you are gonna charge me
im gonna pay you
youre not having sex with my wife for free
and i better not ever catch you anywhere near my house ever again
joel slams down the phone
then realizes its a cell phone picks it back up and hits the end button
suzie is asleep on the couch in her sweatpants
joel walks through mumbles something about going to a party
joel pulls up to the house where the party is going on
he stays in the car checking it out
scanning joels pov we see the band godscock playing in the backyard with rory on bass
they are set up on the patio of this small two bedroom suburban house
most of the people at the party are crowded around the keg which is on the other side of the backyard ignoring the band
the band sounds awful loud as hell unmusical uninspired
the lead singer sings in that awful eddie vedder style but even more loud and overly dramatic
rory acts all intense in stark contrast to the non intensity of the music
they all have that baggy shorts tattooed mid nineties look
its downright pathetic
theres one drunk guy off to the side banging his head playing air guitar and stumbling into the bushes
joel spots cindy over by the keg drinking mingling
he watches her for a beat then shakes his head and drives away
joel sits at the bar talking to dean drinking a beer
i cant believe my wife slept with that guy
i thought you said it wouldnt bother you
i guess i didnt really think about it long enough
i just wish it hadnt been so easy for him
yeah im tellin ya chicks really go wild for that brad
off joels look sorry
no youre right
he may be a stupid dull witted moron but he can get any girl he wants
me i had to work for it
i had to work hard get a career going take suzie out a bunch of times marry her
but not brad
he gets to waltz into my house and have sex with my wife just like that
oh and by the way
that little prick was at my house again today
what was he doing
take a wild guess
you pay a guy to do a job then he comes back and does it for free
im not going to let him do it for free
im paying him
oh i dont know
the same i guess
so should i get my twenty dollars from brad then or
joel shoots dean an angry look
we can worry about that later
look at the bright side now you can call cindy
i dont know
i feel weird about it
besides shes at the party she probably wont be home til late
you know what you need to do
rolling his eyes i dont wanna do drugs dean
look i know i joke around a lot but this time im serious
like a doctor you should try smoking a little pot
its just an herb it heals
stress can kill you and i get paranoid when i smoke pot
not when you just smoke a little
you ever meet my friend willie
really great guy
as if its a positive hes the guy i got that horse tranquilizer from
willie loads up some kind of giant three foot tall bong and inhales a massive bong load
hes a burly ex football player type who looks like he might have an extra y chromosome or two
joel watches willie feeling a little uneasy
ive been reading about it theyre making technological advances now coming up with great drugs that can make you happy and wont leave you with a hangover or nothin
holding in bong hit right on
willie finally exhales
the exhale seems to go on way longer than humanly possible endless amounts of pot smoke billowing out accomplished with special fx
he finally hands the bong and lighter to joel
oh i dont know
im kind of a light weight
i think thats too much for me still holding out the bong and lighter bullshit
come on joel
dont worry this stuff isnt that strong
to willie re joel
he gets paranoid when he gets too stoned
joel looks at willie then at dean then takes the bong partly out of being intimidated by willie
ah what the hell
willie instructs joel on the bong usage in the same condescending way a weight lifting instructor would
okay now this is a gravity bong
have you ever used one before
umm i think
okay pay attention
put your thumb right here on the carburetor
when i pull the plunger up and say let go i want you to let go and inhale hard
joels pov looking down the barrel of the three foot bong with macho man willie holding the lighter at the bowl
you know maybe i should just let starting to get scary bullshit
mostly out of fear joel exhales
willie puts the bong up to joels face lights it and starts lifting the plunger
then pushes it down
joel lets go of the carburator inhales
joel inhales with all his might sucking up massive amounts of thick pot smoke as willie pushes down the plunger
willie dean and joel sitting around completely baked especially joel
we play most of the scene from joels stoned paranoid pov
dean makes some kind of barely audible mumble or did he
joels pov looking from dean to willie
willie sits there with red eyes barely open
willie turns slowly to joel
oh i thought somebody said something
willie looks at joel stone faced adding even further to joels paranoia
he stares at joel for a long beat
then in an instant hes right up in joels face
joel jumps back scared shitless
willie starts laughing his ass off
the look on your face
man you really do get paranoid when you get stoned
fake timid laugh yeah heh heh
hey joel why dont you call that chick now
what time is it
time for you to call her and finally get laid man
handing him the phone come on
its twelve thirty
she might be back by now
joel gets the phone number out of his pocket
so whats this chick look like
oh shes got brown hair
kind of working class looking
what do you mean by that
willie stares at joel for a beat
joel cant tell if hes offended willie or not
oh you know
is she kind of slutty lookin
joels not sure if that was the right answer either
thats how i like em
kinda nasty heh heh
joel starts dialing the number
i hope i dont wake her up
at least you know shes home
try her again
joel hits redial
man what kind of person doesnt have call waiting
i dont have call waiting
i hate call waiting
every time i hear that goddamn clicking sound i wanna put my fist through someones head
once again joel doesnt know whether to shit or wind his watch
willie stares at him then haaa ha
man you really do get paranoid when youre stoned
seriously though i fuckin hate call waiting
willie grabs the phone
here let me dial
youre too stoned
willie grabs the piece of paper with cindys number
he looks at it starts to dial then pauses realizing something
willie looks up at joel with slowly building rage then hangs up the phone
ill tell you why youre getting a busy signal
this is my number
youre joking right
trying to make me paranoid
joel waits for willie to start cracking up
he just continues glaring at joel
we hear the front door unlock
sorry im late i
what are you doing here
willie stands up and walks over to joels chair
dean suddenly stands up
well it looks like you guys got a lot to talk about here so i think im just gonna go ahead and take off
willie moves in closer on joel
joel starts to leave but willie blocks him
willie grabs joel and throws him against the wall
joel tries to make a break for the door but willie hauls off and punches him across the face
the ass kicking begins as we
joel limps into the house his face bruised black and blue from the ass kicking
he looks awful
as he limps into the bedroom as quietly as possible he trips on something waking up suzie
she turns on a light and sees joel
oh my god joel are you alright
i just ah
got my ass kicked
go back to sleep
it was just
some guy over at scoreboards
let me drive you to the hospital
you need to get checked out
ill be fine
i just want to sleep right now okay
you sure youre okay
it looks like your nose is broken and your dont worry about it
people get their asses kicked all the time
its no big deal
go back to sleep
joel walks past his secretary
brian wanted to see you oh my god what happened
joel keeps walking mumbles something about falling down some stairs goes into his office and shuts the door
joel walks over to the window overlooking the production area
he looks down and sees cindy working with her back turned
shakes his head
brian knocks on the door and enters looking worried
did you talk to step yet
he isnt returning my calls
weve got problems
he did hire a lawyer joe adler hes that personal injury lawyer you see on all the bus stop benches
you oughtta see this guy
hes a real piece of shi noticing joels face oh man what happened to you
oh i fell down some stairs
well anyway i hate to say this but i think were screwed
theres no way this adler guy is gonna settle for anything less then bankrupting us
says hell sue us into the stone age
clutches his head shit
i gotta talk to step
brian looks at joels bruised face
man everyones getting hurt
cindy came in with a black eye today
you hear how she got it
step did it
can you believe that
where did you hear that
thats what she told mary
does he even know her
apparently theyve been going out
i know its weird
they didnt even meet here
they met at a grocery store or something
just a total coincidence
joel looks down at cindy on the production floor his mind reeling
anyway were gonna have to hire a couple of new people because really
and if its okay with you id like to go ahead and fire hector
you know marys purse
its gotta be him
who else could it be
joel looks down at cindy with growing suspicion
dont fire him
just trust me on this
give him another week
if anything else is stolen then you can fire him
if you say so
brian looks joel over
man are you okay
have you seen a doctor
joels secretary beeps in
joel dean is on line one for you
i better get this
sorry i bailed on you like that last night
its just that i dont like to get involved in other peoples personal shit you know what i mean
i didnt even know willie had a girlfriend
she must be new
man willie looked pissed
i thought he was gonna take a swing at you there for a second
he did take a swing at me dean
in fact he beat the living shit out of me
man that really goes to show you this town is smaller than you think
you really gotta be careful
joel hangs up and walks out of his office past his secretary
im not feeling well
im going to go home early
joel turns the corner to his house and does a double take as he sees brads truck going the opposite direction
joel slams on the brakes turns around chases brads truck down and cuts him off forcing him to stop
they both get out of their vehicles
joel is livid
what the hell were you doing on my street again
dude you werent supposed to be home for another four hours whoa what happened to your face
trying to improvise a tough snappy comeback but cant quite make it
the same thing thats gonna happen
your face is gonna look worse if
if i ever catch you anywhere near my house or my wife again ill have you arrested
suzie let me in
joel is stumped brad actually has a point
what the hell is wrong with you anyway
do you do this with all your clients just keep coming back and hanging around
i dont know
this is my first one
i thought you were a professional
look man i know shes your wife an shit but you might as well know i think were in love
man are you stupid
you are so goddamn dumb
you think she loves you
youre nothing but a piece of ass to her
i dont think so dude
oh you dont think so dude
well did you ever think about this she doesnt even know that i paid you to have sex with her did that cross your small mind
how about i go home right now and tell her

brad suddenly looks worried
this really freaks him out
you wouldnt do that
you dont think so
realizing hes serious no
dude please dont
joel starts back to his car
look man we really have a special thing going on
please dont mess it up
dont mess it up
youre talking about my wife
joel gets in his car and starts it
calls out to him dude you cant do this to me
oh yes i can
joel peels out drives half a block and turns into his driveway
joel walks in still pissed off
suzie is sitting on the couch a little surprised to see him
youre home early
joel walks over to the sliding glass door looks outside at the pool
so how was that new pool cleaner
suzie is caught off guard wonders if shes busted but she plays it cool
what do you mean
what do you think i mean
did he do a good job cleaning the pool
well did he get all the
it doesnt really look that clean
i mean im looking at it and id say its pretty goddamn filthy
did the guy even clean it at all
it sure doesnt look like it
well yeah i guess he didnt do a very good job
i think he did a horrible job
i dont think we should use him anymore
suzie watches joel leave a slight look of guilt on her face
are you all right joel
you want an aspirin or anything
quick shot of joel staring up at the ceiling shaking his head cant believe all this
in a wide shot we see joels car is parked on the street
he walks up and rings the doorbell
we see step answer talk to him and then invite him in
step and joel enter
steps pound half brother sits on a ratty couch watching tv drinking a huge plastic bottle of pepsi
he looks like hes been sitting there for years
the tv is deafeningly loud
wow i dont think youve ever been to my house before
talking above the tv yeah i dont think so
i wouldve remembered
this is my half brother phil
joel starts to motion dont get up then realizes thats not happening anyway
hey step can we talk in another room
sure lets go out back
joel and step sit at a picnic table
you know my lawyer told me not to talk to you
youre not here to try to talk me out of suing are you
no im just kind of curious about
so youve been going out with cindy huh
shes my girlfriend
we might even get married after all this lawsuit settlement stuff gets worked out
so some of the guys at work are saying you gave cindy that black eye
that aint true at all
yeah i know its not
she got it from falling down some stairs
look you might wanna be careful with cindy
what do you mean
well im not sure how to put this but
you know you got a lot of money coming your way with this settlement
you might wanna be oh no
no she didnt even know about that til after we started going out
you sure about that
i didnt tell her about it for a while cuz i was kind of embarrassed you know
you dont tell a girl you just met that you lost one of your balls
especially a girl as hot as cindy
you know she lives with this guy willie right
thats her ex
she broke up with him
shes gonna move out
she just needs to get all her stuff outta there
you sure about that
shes moving in with me
look i know cindys got some problems but she means well
shes the best thing that ever happened to me
if you say so
another thing you just might want to watch your back
some of the guys at work who think you gave cindy the black eye were talking about paying you a visit you know getting even
well im not worried about that
dead serious proud i could kick anyones ass at that whole company
brad and suzie are by the pool which is filthy
brad starts coming on to suzie
she pushes him away
no brad we cant
im sorry but we have to stop doing this
its not right
i feel horrible
besides i think joels getting suspicious
and you gotta start cleaning the pool too
but ive never felt this way about anyone before
and ive been with a lot of chicks
look brad the truth is i love my husband
i really do
this was all a big mistake
i dont know what got into me but we have to stop this
i want to make my marriage work again
im going to tell joel about the whole thing and just hope he forgives me
and even if he doesnt at least i wont be carrying around this horrible feeling
i just cant stand that he doesnt know
this doesnt mean we cant still see each other though right
ah yes it does
because of all the things i just said
do you need me to say them again
can i see you tomorrow
how about next week
look you gotta go brad
joel could be home any second
ill call you tomorrow
just trying to get rid of okay
okay just go and well talk later
brad leans to kiss her she pushed him away and he finally leaves
god what a moron
joel sits deep in his chair bummed out staring down at the manufacturing area
brian walks in
the meeting with steps lawyer
or lawyers i should say
its today remember
joel drags himself out of the chair
joe adler is holding court with the various lawyers and paralegals waiting for the meeting to start
as promised he is awful
he looks like henry winkler with an extra y chromosome and a lot of steroids
maybe cast gene simmons with his hair pulled back in a pony tail
you see if both his balls had been knocked clean off he would be a good case but not a great case a man with no balls is no man
hes a freak
hes barely human
and a jury will never feel like they can walk in the shoes of a ball less neutered he she freak
hes still got one ball barely
hes still a man
a man whos very manhood has been jeopardized but still a man
and that manhood that very sense of what you are as a human being is hanging by a thread
jesus you cant get more dramatic than that
that brave ball hanging on for dear life hanging on for justice is going to be the hero of this trial
im tellin ya this step guy is the fuckin holy grail the powerball jackpot
and you all laughed at me when i bought those bus bench ads
but i knew the asses of those poor slobs that sit on those benches and ride those sweaty stinking cattle cars are our future
and i joel and brian walk in
im joe adler
everybody starts introducing each other
a bunch of employees including mary garielle and rory are talking getting worked up
and when they sell the company joel and brian are gonna be the ones who get rich and and were the ones doing all the work
its bullshit man
we should get a piece of it
i work my ass off
gabrielle and i work harder than anybody
i should be making what brian makes
if you add up all the crates i move i lift pounds a day
here hes gonna make a million dollars and were the ones who do everything
i went to college
for three years
if we quit this place couldnt run
they wouldnt be able to sell this place for anything
jim a tall skinny something guy with a ridiculously big mustache and a little paunch chimes in
thats why what we should do is is we should all go on strike demand stock in the company before it sells
if general mills knew we were on strike they wouldnt buy this place until the strike was over
that way theyd have to give us stock
jim points to his head gives everyone a hows that nod
it starts to build steam
thats right man
we should do it
we should strike
i could get a job at gemco like that
at gemco all the employees are owners even says so on the name tags
i could get a job at southwest airlines
the meeting is already in progress
on adlers side of the table are two other lawyers and a couple of paralegals
on joels side its just he brian and joels secretary
maybe one lawyer who doesnt say much
everybody has in front of them a small stack of documents
the confrence room like joels office has a full length window facing the manufacturing area
weve gone through everything and the only way we would even begin to consider a settlement would be to the tune of the number you see on the bottom of
does everyone have this
joel and the rest of them find page
joel is stunned by the number
so pissed he can barely get the words out we dont have this much money
not even close
not in cash you dont
of course not
but if you were to sell off your assets the property lease the equipment the what the ff are you shitting me
that would bankrupt us
this is what ive been trying to tell you joel
if you think im just going to give up this entire company that i built from the ground up adler jumps up dripping with phoney forced indignation
how about what my client gave up
how about that
he walks over to the door
in fact ill make a deal with you we will drop this case right now if you come over here and put your testicles right here indicates the space between
the door and the and let me slam this door like this
adler slams the door ridiculously hard
we can settle this right now call it even
i will drop this case right now if you let me slam your balls in this door it was an accident
not according to our investigation
we believe that in fact there was gross negligence
the employees same ones in the breakroom are milling around talking the idea of the strike gaining momentum
rory points up to the confrence room
i heard those guys up there are the guys from general mills
employees pov adler pacing around yelling joel yelling back etc
they cant hear any of it
see now theyre probably up there negotiating right now cuttin up the pie that we baked
thats what it looks like to me
the employees all nod in agreement
employees pov adler pointing at his balls pointing to the door again about to slam it
one of his lawyers stops him
we gotta act fast
they could be about to close the deal
yeah and leave us out in the cold
yeah then its too late
if theyve already sold it we cant get a piece of it
we gotta act fast
we need to do one of those walk outs
well we better do it now
okay whos in
we need a show of force
come on its now or never
we pan around the employees as the idea builds momentum ending on hector who looks completely confused by it all
the meeting heats up
okay then let me go back to my previous offer i will gladly come down on that price ill come all the way down to zero and drop this case
if you go over there right now and slam your testicles in that door
because i dont wanna slam my testicles in the door
i want you to be reasonable
you wont even budge one penny
like i say if you slam your ill slam your balls in the door
im sorry did you just threaten me
brian puts his hand on joel motions him to calm down
look we need to cool off a minute
well be right back
brian leads joel out of the room
i dont need this
im going home
joel walks down the stairs
the group of employees see him and ready themselves for the big confrontation
joel notices them all looking at him and stops
but they are ill prepared
no one knows who should talk first
its incredibly awkward
they all look at each other and mutter things like go ahead you first
we were just uh
well rory was talking about how you guys are doing this deal with general mills and we just think that ah
we were considering the idea of ah
well we just think that we should maybe get a piece of it you know cuz we do all the work
and if we dont
joels in no mood for this
he goes off on them
you know what
youre all in charge all of you
gestures to all the as of now
you run the goddamn place
in fact you can go up there right now and meet with adler
he may slam your balls in the door but woohoo
youre the boss
joel storms out leaving the employees standing there
a bickering match erupts over who was supposed to do the talking who said they would say what who backed down first etc
i was gonna say something but you interrupted you didnt say anything when he was leaving so i thought you were quitting
i wouldve stood up to him
as the argument dies down one by one they all go back to their posts muttering
joel is sitting at the table picking at some food looking miserable
suzie comes over gathers up her nerve
listen joel theres something i have to tell you
i think we need to be honest with each other
suzie sits down
im not sure how to say this but well youve been so caught up in youre work lately and im here alone all day and sometimes i just you banged
the pool cleaner
suzie is stunned
thats what youre trying to tell me right
you had sex with brad
yes i knew
i hired him
well i know you hired him but how did you know about i dont mean i hired him to clean the pool i mean i hired him to have sex
hes a gigolo suzie
suzie is stupefied
joel is so fed up he just tells her everything
i hired him to have an affair with you so that i could have an affair without feeling guilty
i was really drunk and on some kind of horse tranquilizer and
brad was getting paid
disbelief hurt so youve been paying brad this whole time
all fifteen times
jesus christ suzie
joel sinks into his chair shaking his head
i only paid him once well twice
the rest was on the house
long beat as suzie tries to let it all sink in
you wanted to have an affair with another woman
but i didnt
suzie paces around for a moment reeling processing all this
then decisively you asshole
oh im the asshole
how could you
how could i
how could you
you didnt have to have sex with him
you couldve simply said no thanks
just clean the pool but you didnt did you
no you took him up on his little offer and had sex with him fifteen times
none of this wouldve happened if you hadnt hired him
ill admit i made a big mistake
i was drunk on drugs stressed sexually frustrated and i shouldnt have hired a male prostitute to seduce you
but if you had simply been faithful none of this wouldve happened
suzie just looks at him for a beat
youre sick you know that
joel cant really argue this point
what do you see in brad anyway
hes borderline retarded
you probably couldve been arrested for having sex with a guy that dumb
suzie heads for the door
joel follows after her
youre not leaving me
im leaving you
joel opens the door about to storm out only to find nathan standing right there about to ring the doorbell
oh hey guys
glad i caught ya
you guys hardly ever answer the door
they are both so flustered they can barely talk
nows not a good time nathan
joel turns around storms off back into the house
oh you guys goin somewhere
look we cant talk right now
well you think i could go ahead and get that check from ya then
im just trying to balance my checkbook here
nows not a good time
when would be a good time you think
i dont know
see the thing is okay tomorrow
great what time
i dont know
just come by tomorrow
i cant talk now
and if you could just go ahead and have that check thatd be great
its a hundred and ten
thats two plates at yeah okay
suzie shuts the door cutting him off
joel checks into an extended stay america hotel
a chain of hotels that rent by the week
quick shot of joel sitting alone in the room
he drops his suitcase and glumly sits down on the bed grabs the remote
he turns on spectravision and surfs the adult titles decides hes not into it and switches back to regular tv only to find american idol is on
he stares at it for a beat then flops down on the bed and stares at the ceiling
joel sits at the bar drowning his sorrows
dean is over by the cash register tending to some business
brad enters walks over to joel
joel looks the other way
i know you probably want to kick my ass but i couldnt kick your ass if i wanted to
youre a good years younger than me and im a pussy
so why dont you just leave me alone
i just wanted to tell you im not gonna see suzie anymore
you dont have to worry
joel keeps drinking his beer stares straight ahead
the last time i was over there she broke it off told me to quit coming over
she said she was gonna tell you everything you know about us
shes really into you dude
i guess thats why she married you an shit
youre a lucky guy
sorry if i messed shit up
joel takes another swig
whyd you have to get hung up on suzie
you could have any girl you want
yeah but i want suzie
and i cant have her
you had her fifteen times
yeah but she doesnt love me dude
its just not the same
anyway just wanted to tell you that
you told me
brad starts to leave
then he stops turns around
oh one more thing
i quit my landscaping job
and i dont think im really cut out to be a gigolo
so i was wondering if you had any openings over there at your extract place
brad you had sex with my wife
im not gonna give you a job okay
brad walks away
joel stares at his beer for a beat thinking
he calls out to brad
i dont know
maybe come by the office tomorrow
fill out an application
ill see what i can do
brian sits with joel
they both look pretty miserable
brian looks down at some papers shaking his head
general mills has pretty much withdrawn the offer pending a really favorable settlement with step
shaking his head not only do we not sell the company we could wind up bankrupt
muttering to himself so i dont sell the company dont get the money im bankrupt i dont get cindy i paid a guy to have sex with my wife and
she actually did it
suzie is trying to clean the pool herself struggling with the long pole with the net at the end
she looks miserable
nathan enters through the back gate
nathan walks over to suzie
shes in no mood for this
she acts as unfriendly as possible
why are you cleaning the pool yourself
that new guy didnt work out
yeah didnt work out
boy you just cant get good help eh
so did you get a chance to write that check
look nathan joel and i arent going to that dinner okay
nathan acts deeply disappointed
well gee i wish you wouldve told me that before i went and bought the tickets
joel never agreed to this nathan and neither did i
well it sure sounded like you guys were going
leslie was gonna talk to you about it but you didnt return our calls
i mean i already bought these tickets
i really wish you guys had been a little more clear with me
its the last straw
suzie has had enough
she unleashes all her pent up aggression on nathan
okay let me be really clear with you then
when we say i dont think so or even im not sure that means no
why cant you understand that
well i just
in fact let me be even more clear with you
we dont like you
is that clear enough
youre dull you never shut up you never listen and we dont want anything to do with you ever again
nathan freezes in some kind of state of shock
he starts to shake a little
suzie just keeps going it feels too good to stop
is that clear enough for you nathan
nathan starts to go into some kind of seizure
nathans eyes roll back into his head and he collapses
joel pulls into the parking lot
he looks surprised seeing something on the other side of the lot that gets his attention
from joels pov we see cindy pull up and get out of her car
joel watches as she gets out with a grocery bag and heads up the stairs
joel gets out and watches her from a distance
he sees her go into a room and shut the door
he stares up at the door for a beat
then with a look of determination joel walks up the stairs and knocks on her door
cindy opens the door a little startled to see joel but pleasant to him
howd you know i was here
ah actually im staying here too
down on the first floor around the back
i thought i saw you so i ah
well come in
joel enters stands in the living room
cindy heads in to the kitchen
do you want something to drink
i think all i have is diet coke
joel notices marys purse lying on the coffee table
he stares at it
cindy comes back in with a diet coke
have a seat
joel remains standing looking at the purse
thats marys purse
thats marys purse
no thats mine
so how are things at work
thats marys purse
you stole it didnt you
cindy acts like hes being silly
theres nothing about her demeanor that would make anybody think shes lying
it probably just looks like it
theres a lot of those
ive never seen another one
you probably have sylvias wallet in here somewhere too dont you
and everything else thats been stolen from my employees
joel are you okay
no im not
thats marys purse goddammit
everyone blamed hector
he almost got fired
doesnt that bother you
innocent sweet joel i dont know what youre hector
hard working guy never did anything wrong
and what are you doing with step
youre trying to screw him out of his settlement money arent you
i have no idea what youre talking about
yes you do
youre the only reason hes suing us arent you
you know how much work it took for me to build up that company
you just dont care about anybody do you
what are you some kind of sociopath
cindy looks like joel might be getting to her
you cant even admit that you stole this purse can you
you just cant do it
in fact you probably cant tell the truth about much of anything can you
cindy turns away from him looking down at the floor
i bet cindys not even your real name is it
who are you
where the hell are you from
cindy still looking away doesnt answer
you cant answer can you
because if you said one true thing youd have to tell the truth about something else and then it would all unravel wouldnt it
then youd have to admit that you stole this purse and god knows what else
cindy still looking away down at the floor
we see her eyes well up about to cry but joel doesnt notice
well im leaving now
joel picks up the purse
and im taking this purse with me
if it really is yours you can call the police and tell em i stole it
in fact im gonna call the police and report it
joel walks towards the door
then cindy slumps down on the couch mutters something still looking down at the floor her voice cracking slightly
still looking down please dont report it to the police
im on probation
ill go to jail
for a long time
maybe you shouldve thought about that before you started ripping off my employees
joel starts to open the door
ill leave step alone
hell drop the lawsuit
joel considers this
how do i know that
you can keep the purse
if i dont leave him alone if he doesnt drop the lawsuit then you can report me
i guess that ah
do you have sylvias wallet and jims watch
can i get those too
cindy nods still looking down
joel considers it
i guess that works
and i guess you just admitted that you stole the purse
thats good i guess
a step in the right direction
joel sits down on the couch also
with her head still down cindy is weeping quietly
joel doesnt notice looking straight ahead
so whats your deal anyway
i mean how did you end up like this
joel finally looks over notices that shes crying
hes caught off guard
cindy breaks down and starts bawling
okay now you see
thats what im talking about
youre trying to manipulate me now and im not gonna fall for it
cindy starts bawling even harder
i really hope youre not faking this right now because im feeling really bad
are you faking it
cindy shakes her head no
im sorry i was just curious you know how a person ends up like
cindy suddenly starts bawling hysterically
joel stands there awkwardly not sure if he should hug her or comfort her in any way
joel tentatively puts a comforting arm around her and she leans in to him crying on his chest
he puts his other arm around her and she snuggles in even closer
as her crying gradually subsides she snuggles in even more
finally she lifts her head and they start kissing
as they get hot and heavy we
wide shot of the hotel
its a beautiful morning
joel wakes up looking more relaxed than weve ever seen him
we pull out to reveal that hes alone in cindys bed
he sits up yawns
he has a big satisfied smile on his face
he looks around realizes hes alone
then suddenly looks worried
he scrambles for his pants then looks relieved as he realizes his wallet is still there
he sets down the pants then after a beat picks them up again checks inside the wallet and sees theres still cash and credit cards
then he looks up at the chest of drawers and sees marys purse sylvias wallet and a watch placed side by side
he lies back in bed and shuts his eyes grinning again
extract bottles moving along the assembly line full steam
mary and gabriella gossiping
looks at her watch joel hasnt been in all morning
can you believe that
if we come in late we get fired
and here were working our tails off and hes gonna get rich
joel walks in bright eyed and cheery greeting people
he walks over to mary carrying her purse
here you go mary
joel hands her the purse
mary looks at it not quite sure how to react not ever wanting to appear grateful for anything not in her nature
and by the way hector didnt take it
joel walks off
mary just shakes her head at him
she whispers to gabriella
can you believe that
blaming cindy just to protect hector
joel is at his desk
brian comes in
steps here to see you
bring him in
no hes outside
at the loading dock
wants to talk to you alone back there for some reason
man to man
step is pacing around waiting
joel comes out
how you doin
hows your ah
looking down at his oh its okay
some days it still hurts but theyve got me on some pills
its not too bad i guess
they both sit down on the edge of the dock
cindy left me
joels nods not surprised but sympathetic
yeah it is a bummer
you know i thought the worst part was having my balls knocked off but you know what the worse part is
dealin with all this bullshit
im sick of that adler guy tellin me what to do
hes a real dick
yeah he sure is
the truth is i just want to have my old life back i just want to go back to work
im a workin man thats what i do
im beginning to think i might be the same way
im a little worried about what id do with too much time on my hands
i just lay around and watch tv all day
i think i do a lot worse
the problem is if i bankrupt the company there wont be a job to go back to
you dont have to bankrupt the company
yeah but then if i drop the lawsuit youll sell the company and the new company might not hire me
well maybe i dont have to sell the company
you know ive been thinking all these years ive been building this company dreaming about the day i could sell it and retire but what would i really do if
its like that old saying its not about the destination its about the journey
step just stares at him blankly he lost him
i guess what im saying is too much free time might not be such a good thing like that old saying idle hands are the devils playground
steps never heard that one either
im sorry i dont do much book readin
what im saying is im thinking maybe i wont sell the company
that is if you dropped the lawsuit
and remember youll still get that insurance money probably a couple hundred thousand
what do you think
that sounds fair
but under one condition
you make me floor manager
they shake hands
joel walks in with step at his side
addresses the employees
hold the line
mary shuts off the conveyer belt
okay listen up everybody
waits for them to settle ive decided not to sell the company
gasps and murmurs among the employees
and im making step the new floor manager
more gasps and murmurs
and if anyone doesnt like it i hear theyre hiring over at gemco
but just remember at gemco the owner doesnt know your names you never even meet him hes at an office up in chicago somewhere and you get an auto response
if you try to email him to complain about anything
here you can come up to my office any time you have a problem
joel walks off
brian catches up with him
youre not selling
its about the journey brian
angle on mary
she and gabrielle start right back up
you know if joels going to put him in charge we should go on strike
you know at gemco the union handles the strikes and you dont even have to pull out as step cuts her off
quit yapping and get back to work or youre fired
step walks off maybe pops a testosterone pill
mary and gabrielle keep muttering and shaking their heads
long pull out as things get back to normal at the factory
we are close on nathan in a coffin embalmed
we pull out to see mourners lined up taking a last look at the body
joel is among them
he looks down at nathan for a moment and then continues to his seat
a few rows back we see suzie sitting by herself dressed in black
quick shot of nathans casket being lowered into the ground as the priest says the last few words
people hug and console each other
joel sees suzie walks over to her
you doing okay
yeah im okay
i heard you were right there when it happened
that mustve been rough
it was horrible joel
he came over to ask for that check and i just
suzie breaks down starts crying
i just lost it
i started yelling at him
i said horrible things
he had an aneurism and i probably caused it
i think the last thing i said to him was shut up
those were the last words he heard
joel hugs her consoling
its okay its not your fault
its not your fault
suzies crying subsides a little
it could happen to any of us joel
any of us could have an aneurism
we could die at any moment
yeah i know
but we probably wont
itll be alright
suzie starts to regain her composure
they stand there for a beat
you wanna go get something to eat
suzie still sniffling a little
they walk off towards the cemetery gates
after a while joel hands suzie a kleenex
they walk a little further
joel looks at the chapel nearby
maybe we shouldve been married in a church like that one
instead of the botanical gardens
i thought you liked the botanical gardens
a church just seems more i dont know official
you think it wouldve made a difference
i dont know
so are we still married
well legally yes
i mean otherwise
we can talk about it i suppose
they walk for a beat
you know this is really bad but
oh never mind
well as i was looking down at nathan there i was thinking
thats the longest ive ever seen him with his mouth shut
suzie laughs in spite of herself
