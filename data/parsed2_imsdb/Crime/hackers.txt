written by rafael moreu slow motion
armed troops in black uniforms pour out of unmarked vans and swarm across a lawn in a middle class residential neighborhood
yuppie neighbours look on in shock confused
two of the troops carry a battering ram to the front door of a white two storey house
a leashed rottweiler snarls and barks
in position their comrades point m s into first floor windows ready to be ambushed
pan into a window in the kitchen
an attractive woman in her thirties is making breakfast
now in regular motion the battering ram breaks open the front door
the woman startled drops her spatula
to others upstairs
troops pour into the house
whats going on
whats the matter
who are you
the troops and one or two trenchcoated agents continue entering the house and heading upstairs still with rifles ready
upstairs crowded in the narrow hallway the troops descend on a bedroom
off camera dade
knock it down
the battering ram knocks down a bedroom door
the prosecutor a woman of about forty gives her closing argument blandly
shed rather be somewhere else
the defendant dade murphy who calls himself zero cool has repeatedly committed criminal acts of a malicious nature
this defendant possesses a superior intelligence which he uses to a destructive and antisocial end
his computer virus crashed one thousand five hundred and seven computer systems including wall street trading systems single handedly causing a seven point drop in the new york stock market
as she speaks the camera pans across the court panning down and stopping on the defendant eleven year old dade murphy
fast forward to the sentencing
dade murphy i hereby fine your family forty five thousand dollars
the court gasps dades father winces and sentence you to probation under which you are forbidden to own or operate a computer or touch tone telephone until the day of
your eighteenth birthday
now dade winces in fact we almost expect him to cry
opening credits roll to a backdrop of dade and his family and lawyer fighting through a gaggle of journalists and photographers in slow motion and driving away
aboard a jetliner dade murphy is staring blankly out the window wearing headphones
exterior view from the aircraft of approaching new york city
the view becomes a direct overhead of the buildings and streets of the city which then metamorphoses through animation into chips and digital signals on a stylised computer board
the title logo
segue to dade murphy now wearing mirrorshades indoors and at night working on his new computer
his mother calls him
off camera dade
what are you doing
after a semi pregnant pause im taking over a tv network
finish up honey and get to sleep
and happy birthday
in the otv studios security department a phone rings a man answers nervously
security uh norm norm speaking
this is mr
eddie vedder from accounting
i just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file i was working on
listen im in big trouble do you know anything about computers
uh gee uh
right well my blt drive on my computer just went awol and ive got this big project due tomorrow for mr
kawasaki and if i dont get it in hes gonna ask me to commit hari kari
yeah well you know these japanese management techniques
pause could you uh read me the number on the modem
its a little boxy thing norm with switches on it
lets my computer talk to the one there
dade goes to work on otv
he closes his eyes and a flurry of half second video clips from old tv shows flashes by
he opens his eyes
his screen says entering arps and then wipes to another screen
automated record playback system
there is a graphic representation of the stations automatic videotape changer
dade turns on his tv set and turns to otv
it is running a rush limbaugh type tv show
on tv so called american indians latinos and blacks come from a genetically mediocre stock
yak yak yak
get a job
dade presses a key on his keyboard
the video changer diagram lights up in red
at the station a robotic arm selects a videotape from a huge rack of thousands of tapes
the america first tape slides out of the vtr and is replaced by an episode of the outer limits as dade watches drinks coke and smiles full of himself
you are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to
the outer limits
suddenly the arps screen is replaced by an ominous message hey
he starts to type zero
dade types dades screen dissolves into unbelievable
then the screen changes again the outer limits suddenly flashes off
yeah okay acid burn thats enough
dade starts hacking
apparently so does acid burn
the tape changer machines at otv are swamped sometimes fighting over the same tape
the program on tv keeps changing
the message comes up on dades computer screen more dueling tape changers more half second video clips
as the duel continues dade types back a taunt of his own one last from acid burn then his own computer confirms for him that the connection is terminated
shit on me
murphy is unpacking
dade emerges from his room in a housecoat
he makes a beeline dodging moving boxes for the fridge
you unpack your stuff yet
up all night again huh
can this wait until both my eyes are open please
dades mom picks up the phone mocking a call to the building superintendent
can i cut the electricity to his room so hell sleep normal hours
hes been playing with his computer all night for a solid week
pause well yes he could be playing with himself

dade slams the bathroom door
murphy quickly checks his room
dade is showering
angry through the bathroom door you hooked it up to the phone didnt you

she pauses and regains some of her cool
im sorry we had to move in your senior year
i didnt want to sell the house but i had to take this new job you know that
youre going to love new york its the city that never sleeps
we enjoy several views of new york the morning sun shining between skyscrapers neon signs that stay lit day and night
dade emerges from the ground floor apartment on rollerblades and skates down the street to school
at school hundreds of teenagers converse move around head to class
dade looks lost among them
he walks up to a skinny latino kid in a faux leopard skin muscle shirt
the kid is on a pay phone speaking in spanish
yo chill man im talking to venezuela
yeah im sorry i was just looking for the principals office
sorry i cant help you okay
now dade really looks lost
he heads off in search of the office
dade is filling out a form
do you have your transfer forms
dade stares at her stunned
the girl has a decidedly unconventional appearance yet is a first rate beauty
its a relatively straightforward question
dade notices her lips and in his imagination launches into a flurry of half second video clips and art bites all involving lips and kissing
do you speak english
sorry you wanted
i wanted transfer forms
he gives them to her
she starts leaving
are you coming
dade clues in gets up and follows her
she takes him on a brief tour
the gym is through there and the cafeteria is through there
pause whats your name
they arrive at a classroom

kate starts away
give me time
a guy in the halls notices dade
hey you new
tell him about the pool kate
yeah theres an olympic size swimming pool up on the roof
take the stairs over there
kate starts away again
dade enters and lets the door slam behind him
across the roof a dozen or so geeky looking kids are looking over the edge apparently trying to get someones attention
one of them notices dade
hold the door
hes too late
the geeks look pretty angry
there is no pool
dade realizing hes been had no pool
dade tries the door but its locked
he hammers it with his palm furious
above thunder roars and it begins raining
dade is soaking wet and trudges among his classmates leaving a muddy trail
a three second video clip rolls through his mind it is a screaming woman being strangled in an old movie
he walks past kate who giggles
oh my god
he found the pool
the kids are all seated at computer workstations
dade is hacking the latino kid who was on the phone to venezuela is running a demo involving dirty dancing skeletons
and im subbing for ms
bayliss who was arrested at the anti fur rally
i know some of you kids got computers at home
but these are school property people and i dont want to see any gum stuck to em
designing graphical interface
meanwhile the latino kid notices that dade has been looking up kate libbys school records
and hacking himself into her advanced english class
its after school kids are heading home dade too
the latino kid notices dade and catches up with him
so um whats your interest in kate libby eh

to dade check it friday
phreak hands dade a flyer for cyberdelia
how about the master of disaster huh

phreak walks away
desperate doctor doom
dade rolls in on rollerblades
street vendors hawk computer parts and bootleg software
a bootleg music vendor catches dades attention

compilation tape of my own making
i call this the greatest zooks album
featuring artists like well i got some hendrix on there some joplin mama cass belushi
all great artists that asphyxiated on their own vomit
the small crowd around him finally gets the joke
cant get this in stores man i made it
dade wheels into cyberdelia which just happens to be equipped with a ramp down to its main floor for the benefit of skaters
the place pounds with loud bassy techno music and coloured light
video monitors with psychedelic patterns complete the atmopshere
there is a video game with a huge screen
phreak is at a pay phone
on phone please deposit five dollars for the first minute
phreak holds a small box up to the receiver presses a button and the box emits a series of tones
nonono thank you
dade checks out the scene
kate is playing the big video game
dade skates up to her
she loses her last man
shes got the high score in fact her name dominates the top list
thats a nice score for a girl
irritated by dades presence think you can do better
ill give it a shot
kate yields the controls to dade who begins playing
kates boyfriend looks on from a mezzanine several feet above
is this kid bothering you kate
sorry can i get some room here
to kate why dont you come up here
kate obliges and joins curtis
dade continues playing
he plays brilliantly
the game is a flashy d high speed chase game with lots of surprises
dade loses but his high score is about to come up
dades score comes up
hes in the position
phreak is amazed
to kate well it looks like im on top
kate defeated leaves
no ones ever beat her before
you just made an enemy for life
to someone else boy meets world
kate and curtis are sucking face oblivious to the busy world around them
dade and phreak watch more than a little disgusted
and whats he do
thats it youre looking at it he just looks slick all day
kate and curtis start to take off on curtis motorcycle
kate and dade make eye contact briefly
the motorcycle speeds off into the night
the clock says its
as the camera pans up to dade it changes to
dade is hacking again
its the schools administration system
dade schedules a test of the school sprinkler system for am
dade stands alone in the hall watching the time closely
phreak rounds a corner and meets dade
dade doesnt answer
he watches the time a couple of more seconds then opens an umbrella
immediately the fire sprinklers turn on
phreak starts getting drenched
he realizes what is happening
amused and highly impressed oh my god
a bell rings and students pour out into the halls by the hundreds
theyre all being showered on
a tall cheerleader bounces by phreak pushing her pom pom in his face
to dade you saw that
dade nods in the affirmative
kate walks up to dade also understanding what has happened
what the hell is going on
pool on the roof must have a leak
kate gives dade a look that could kill and skulks away
dade walks away under his umbrella smug and dry
man oh man this is gonna be good
dade kate and a couple of other students are writing on the chalkboard
kate finishes first
if god gave men brains bigger than dogs they wouldnt hump womens legs at cocktail parties
the class giggles
im not so sure your mother qualifies as a significant author of the twentieth century
her last book sold two million copies
almost in unison woooooo
the teacher reads dades quotation
angel headed hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of the night
hes not in this class
i said give me time
hes not enrolled in this class
well hes on my list
kate leaps across a desk and snatches the list from the teacher
dade is on it
she gives dade another filthy look both dade and the teacher just shrug
the teacher moves on to cereal
of all the things ive lost i miss my mind the most
what is your name
the teacher grabs the list back from kate
uh emmanuel goldstein sir
you however are not on my list
in mock shock whoa this isnt wood shop class
the class cracks up
kate and dade exchange looks as the teacher escorts cereal to the door
how was school

no one special
okay i gotta get back to work
im gonna be home late
and would you try and please fill these out
she indicates a pile of college applications
oh dont worry its only the rest of your life
she starts to the door

dade looks over the college applications for a second and pushes them away
hed rather not do this now
dade phreak and joey are sitting at a table
joey is giving a dull account of his hacking adventures
fyi alright man you can sit at home and do like absolutely nothing and
cereal pauses notices dade whom he has never met formally but seen around and then continues
and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day
yeah right man thats a typo
orwells here and now hes living large

joey takes a drag from his cigarette and just nods with a big grin on his face
what are you stoned or stupid

a system operator at ellingson mineral corporation a large oil company notices the intrusion
he gets on the phone
the place is a mess typical of the hacker bachelor pad
empty chinese food boxes and jolt cola cans litter the place
plagues phone is ringing waking him
on phone mr
sleepily my name is the plague
the plague uh something weirds happening on the net
as in what you hapless techno weenie
uh the accounting subdirectory in the gibson is working really hard
we got one person online the workload is enough for like ten users
i think weve got a hacker
okay okay we need proof that we were here
joey starts looking for something to download as proof he was there
yeah garbage okay give me garbage
he selects a garbage file and starts the download
his screen becomes a psychedelic mind trip
the plague glides in on a skateboard
short and thin bearded about but still trying to be a teenage anarchist yet not consciously realizing he sold out that ideal years ago
i is here
ive narrowed the activity to terminal
lets echo see whats up
the huge monitor lights up with the display of the gibsons resources
hal and the plague watch
plague starts surfing around
god wouldnt be up this late
he sees what joey is downloading
a file called garbage
get me the switching control center
he puts on a telephone headset
hal dials for him
into the headset i need to trace a call thats in progress
joey is sneaking a cigarette while his computer downloads
there is a knock at the door
its his mother
loudly panicked uh yeah
hold on mom
hold on one second
he puts out the cigarette and sprays the room with air freshener

joey takes a disk out of his computer and stashes it in an air vent in the cieling
phreak dade and cereal are rollerblading through the halls of an apartment building that is filled with graffiti
it appears that most of the spray bomb art was created by the residents
nice place huh
cereal knocks on a door spray painted hackstock you heard of a hacker called acid burn
you know who he is
surprised no dont know who he is

removing his hood again
pauses then grins broadly yeah sure
nikon and cereal do a fake kung fu move together
later the four are watching tv
on tv is a secret service agent giving a news interview
on tv hackers penetrate and ravage delicate public and privately owned computer systems infecting them with viruses and stealing materials for their own ends
these people they are terrorists
agent richard gill youre hacker enemy number one man
youre a boner
yo showtime showtime
whats going on
cheesy music plays
razor and blade androgynous asian brothers have a community access tv show
waynes world in eye liner
welcome to our show
hack the planet
hack the planet
for those late night hacks
the soft drink of the elite hacker
who are these guys
thats razor and blade
razor and blade
now razor and blade have a disconnected payphone in their studio
thats right this is a payphone
in unison dont ask
as you can see this is just a simple microcassette recorder
shows the microcassette recorder hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters
record the tones that the coins make
and hang up and get your money back
and never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap
if it werent run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons
remember hacking is more than just a crime
its a survival trait
joey is taking a shower wearing walkman headphones singing along with the music
joey finishes turns off the shower still singing
he draws open the shower curtain to find two secret service agents with shotguns pointed at him
what did i do
the agents drag joey still naked and wet out of the shower and into the living room
his mother is hysterical
get in there
stay down there
joey is pushed into a sofa
he sees his computer lucy being carried away
joey dives onto the agent carrying lucy away losing his towel
his mother seeing his exposed buttocks is shocked
a police type vehicle pulls up
its agent richard gill of the secret service
he stops a young agent for an update
hows it going ray
it looks good sir
weve got an uncorrupted hard drive
in english please
i didnt spend ten years protecting the president so i could finish my career feeling like an idiot
im sorry sir
we caught him by surprise so we dont think he had time to erase his computer files
alright lets finish up here and take him in for interrogation
they split up
a reporter and her sound man run up to gill
agent gill can you spare a moment of your time
why of course jennifer
while jennifer conducts the interview agents lead joey into an unmarked car
his mother is behind him still hysterical
just how dangerous are hackers
well hackers penetrate and ravage delicate public and privately owned computer systems infecting them with viruses
and stealing sensitive materials for their own ends
these people theyre terrorists
a tall impressive building
a cavernous atrium filled with busy people
a handsome looking woman in her late thirties walks in
good morning gentlemen
please be seated
i see were still dressing in the dark eugene
to margo once again dont call me eugene
to the board a recent unknown intruder penetrated using a superuser acount giving him access to our whole system
precisely what youre paid to prevent
someone didnt bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords
now as i so meticulously pointed out the for most used passwords are love gesturing lewdly sex secret and
eyeing margo god
so would your holiness care to change her password
margo just blinks prettily
a hacker planted the virus
yesterday the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty and flooded its tanks
as if to a child the little boat flipped over
a virus planted in the gibson computer system claimed responsibility
what it left a note
plague hits a button on a remote control and the virus a long haired male model appears on a large screen in psychedelic colors
the virus speaks in a hammy italian accent
unless five million dollars are transferred to the following numbered account in seven days i will capsize five tankers in the ellingson fleet
interrupting that is the virus
leonardo da vinci
the problem is we have twenty six ships at sea and we dont know which ones are infected
well then put the ships ballasts under manual control
theres no such thing anymore duke
these ships are totally computerized
they rely on satellite navigation which links them to our network and the virus wherever they are in the world
so what are we supposed to do
well luckily you have a gifted and talented security officer
i traced the hackers call
the secret service picked him up this morning
ill just search his files for the original virus code and then i can eliminate it
plague margo and two suits from the boardroom are riding down an escalator
now look now we expect you to get onto this right away yeah
well how soon
well were working on it as fast as we can
this is a very common occurrence in corporations as large as ours
you have nothing to worry about
now youre sure about that mr
yeah the secret service is helping us out percent
well be in touch
talk to you later
the suits get off the escalator plague and margo take the next one down
what the hell was that all about
i had to move fast
the hacker copied my garbage file
i created mister da vinci so we could call in the secret service
so theyd arrest the hacker sieze his equipment things that we cant do on our own
i dont want to go to jail for this
think about the million dollars
but youve created a virus thats going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster just to arrest some hacker kid
basically uhmm yeah
you know youre sick eugene
sh sh sh sh sh
plague stops a passing secretary and snatches a piece of paper from her hand
ill take care of this
i can cancel it any time
i dont need any program code
but its the perfect cover to confiscate the disc and find out how much of that garbage file has been copied
walking away why did i ever trust you
going back up the escalator get the file
otherwise youll lose all your toys
joey is distraught over the dismantling of lucy
agent ray examines the macs innards
did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated
hes either very smart or very stupid
then he stashed it somewhere or he has an accomplice
well release him until his indictment keep tight surveillance and see if he leads us to your disc
joeys apartment building is an l shaped skyscraper about storeys high unimpressive by new york city standards
two secret service agents are staking joey out in a car outside
unit outside suspect joey pardellas apartment
nothing to report
suspect still grounded
by his mother
his radio crackles
listen to this bullshit
he reads this is our world now
the world of the electron and the switch the beauty of the baud
we exist without nationality skin color or religious bias
you wage wars murder cheat lie to us and try to make us believe its for our own good yet were the criminals
yes i am a criminal
my crime is that of curiosity
i am a hacker and this is my manifesto
huh right manifesto
you may stop me but you cant stop us all
now thats cool
you think its cool
not caring for where bob is going with this its cool
its not cool
its commie bullshit
dade cereal and phreak check their faces
cereal brushes his teeth
to phreak so what do you think can i crash at your place tonight
what is it with this guy
his parents missed woodstock and hes been making up for it since
hey you hear about joeys bust
probably had something to do with that bank in idaho
do you think he could hack a gibson
did you talk to him
his mom said hes grounded for his next three lifetimes
imitating her he isnt to consort with his computer friends
himself again the secret service is really out to get him
changes the subject hey theres a big party tonight you wanna go
dade shakes his head
its at kates
dade just smiles
cereal and phreak leave cereal dancing
plague is wearing a vr helmet and gloves playing some sort of action game
he is unaware that gill has just entered the room
what the hell are you doing
he thumps the vr pedestal
plague finally notices and takes off the helmet
i think weve got something
gill hands plague a folder
it has the logo of stanton high
uuugh hard copy
plague looks it over and recognizes a name
its after school
dades just unlocking the front door only to find a secret service agent behind it
and one behind him in the hallway
both point pistols at him
they slam dade against a wall and start frisking him
what is the
what are you doing man
get off me
they lead him into his room and throw him down on the bed
plague is there
just sit in the bed and keep your hands where we can see them
the year was
and this nasty virus crashed fifteen hundred systems in one day
dade has a flashback
fifteen hundred and seven
astounded wow huh
it got you seven years probation
no computer couldnt even use a touch tone phone
must have been hell huh
getting to the point a virus has been planted in the ellingson mineral computer system
you were our prime suspect till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it
however we have come to believe that one joey pardella is involved in this ellingson virus
he or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that mr
belford needs to disable that virus
we want you to help us find it
the three secret service agents leave plague and dade alone
plague shuts the door behind them
of gill loser
continues i cant believe you were only eleven when you wrote this
its quite an impressive virus
dade i know how you might feel about narking on your friends but were hackers
for us theres no such thing as family and friends
were each our own country with temporary allies and enemies
id like to make a treaty with you
who are you
im the one who understands you
now can we be allies
i dont play well with others
plague is holding dades baseball bat
he shrugs turns around and smashes dades stereo to smithereens
watch which friends you do play with
a record like yours could land you in jail get you kicked out of school no colleges would take you
exiled from everyone and everything you love
plague replaces the baseball bat
ill be in touch
to agents im fine
to dade oh and dade try to stay out of trouble okay
smiles thank you
dade is lying in bed
a door opens
she opens her motorcycle jacket revealing her bare breasts
dade starts to get up she pushes him back own on the bed and starts kissing him passionately
he responds in kind
then gill agent ray and agent bob burst into the room handcuff him break the two up and haul them away as plague looks on smugly
then dade wakes up in a sweat
it was only a dream
he regains his composure
the sound of new york city at night surrounds him
he goes back to sleep
a large well furnished apartment in an elegant old skyscraper in the fashionable part of town
teenagers dance and writhe to loud bassy music
dade and phreak arrive
her mom makes big bucks writing self help books for women
stuff like women who love men who are emotional amoebae phreak shows dade the book
that explains a lot
kate the lovely and gracious hostess mingles and greets her many guests not noticing dade or phreak
cereal offers dade a drink from a plastic bottle

plague is hacking
murphy kid turn you down
in a hammy southern accent i disguised myself as an alabama state trooper and penetrated the fbi ncic
what are you talking about
she turns her back to him
he does up the zipper on her dress
their relationship becomes apparent
the fbi computer holds files on twenty million americans
i just hacked into it
from here i got access to every piece of data ever stored on dade murphys parents
his parents separated five years ago reconciled two years later filed for divorce last year custody battle boy chose to go with his mother
so we get the mother we get the boy
kates room is empty and dade cant resist going back in to play with her laptop which far outclasses his own some more
on the balcony kate notices and comes back in
what the hell are you doing
its cool im just looking
its too much machine for you
dade starts working furiously on it
i hope you dont screw like you type
dade slows to a two finger keypoke not missing a beat
it has a killer refresh rate
triple the speed of the pentium
its not just the chip it has a pci bus
but you knew that
risc architecture is gonna change everything
risc is good
they uncomfortably exchange glances
you sure this sweet machines not going to waste
what was it
mess with the best die like the rest

giggles make it my first born

youre not gonna win
and you have to smile
i dont do dates
but i dont lose either so youre on
montage scenes of dade and kate preparing for the challenge
voice over so heres the deal
the chosen contest to hassle secret service agent richard gill and get one back for joey
dade spray paints camouflage onto his keyboard
our decisions are final by a vote of to
kate rifles through her address book
the duel will last until we declare a winner
dade plays quick draw with disks
use only the dialups access codes and passwords in your collection
cant ask for any help from us
dade having mastered the quick disk draw in the mirror looks satisfied
into mirror talking to me
all five are together at the beginning of the challenge
whose gonna notify his next of kin
dade and kate shake hands and the challenge begins
at a public phone kate hacks into concourse bank looks up richard gill and has his credit card maxed out
destroy card is the final instruction
the other hackers look on
a waiter runs a credit card through a validation machine sees the message and returns to the patrons table
it is richard gill
right there the waiter chops the mastercard in two with a pair of scissors to gills horror
dade hacks into an electronic personal ads system and changes an ad
alright hes in the personal ads
reading dades ad disappointed white male crossdresser looking for discreet friend to bring dreams to reality
leather lace and water sports
at his office gill is on the speaker phone with someone responding to the ad
i know where you can stick it
i know where you can stick it
gill punches a button on the phone another caller comes on
wanna lick your earlobes
i wanna lick your lips
i wanna lick your toes
i wanna lick your ankles
awww yeah you wanna lick something
gill punches another button another caller comes on
thats why they call me stallion
aw thats disgusting
gill punches another button
my heart is steaming for you
gill punches another button
he is becoming quite flustered
spank you with my
aww spank your ass
he punches another button
another caller comes on and gill hangs up the phone disgusted offended and distraught
the plague is there witnessing the whole thing
its kates turn
kate is hacking into the department of motor vehicles
she adds traffic violations and dui offender status to gills record
gill is being arrested quite forcefully by a nyc police grunt
he is thrown onto the hood of his car and handcuffed
do you know who i am
do you know who i am
he hacks into the secret services personnel file and changes gills status to deceased
on phone this is accounting sir
you enquired about an employee of ours an agent richard gill
our records indicate hes deceased
the five are playing pool
like rigor mortis habeas corpus
super hero like even
whats the score
phreak clicks the pool scoreboard so it says
the other four protest
due to mr
gills untimely demise and everything i guess you two will have to improvise the next round
if i win you wear a dress on our date
and if i win so do you
dade thinks about it a second
kate gives dade a look that says im going to hold you to that
a shapely figure wearing a red leather legless suit with a zipper that goes all the way around the crotch
hands caress the sultry figure as the camera pans up
the body belongs to dade murphy
kate wakes up gasping
it was only a dream
she pants and regains her breath
then she smiles
she enjoyed that dream
kate at her locker stops dade
i didnt know your size so i guessed
she opens her locker to reveal a red leather bustier and bikini bottom
you are man enough to stick with the deal arent you
dade walks off
dade signs an electronic pad for a package from ups
he takes the package
he closes the door and opens the package
it is a laptop computer clear plastic shell full colour screen
very high end perhaps the equal to kates machine
he turns it on
the plagues face distorted appears
you wanted to know who i am zero cool
well let me explain the new world order
governments and corporations need people like you and me
we are samurai
the keyboard cowboys
and all those other people out there who have no idea whats going on are the cattle
i need your help you need my help
let me help you earn your spurs
ahh think about it
enjoy the laptop cool
tell me where the disk is
plagues face vanishes
joey lies on his bed with a comic book looking despondent
his mother enters
you look pitiful
okay okay youre not grounded anymore
she kisses his forehead and leaves
he springs back to life gets up and gets the disc from where he stashed it in the air vent
joey is nervously waiting on a park bench
agents ray and bob still have joey staked out
yo whats up
dude dude dude i gotta talk to you a minute listen listen listen
i copied a garbage file from
a garbage files got shit in it joey come on
nono its like hot or something
i dont know
joey a garbage file holds miscellaneous data
bits of stuff thats been erased man
i copied it from ellingson okay
theyre asking me about it alright
will you take a look for me
joey hands phreak the disc
agent bob is taking pictures and phreak notices
oh shit joey youve got a tail
joey sees and runs for it
the agents split up one runs after joey the other after phreak
phreak has lost his tail
he puts joeys disc behind a condom machine in the boys room at school and sticks it there with gum
phreak frantically destroys all records of his hacking career
he knows hes about to be busted
the secret service is about to burst in on phreak
he still hasnt destroyed any records and starts manically going through everything
gill is on his laptop screen
im watching you
a knock on the door
its his mother
time for school come on
the secret service bursts in through the window just as phreaks mom opens the blind
she screams phreak leaps to his feet
secret service dont move
ray sanchez you are under arrest under the computer fraud and abuse act of
phreaks mom becomes very angry and starts slapping phreak cursing in spanish
what are you waiting for arrest me already
the undersized phreak is just a morsel to the hardened thugs behind these bars and they taunt him viciously as he is led to his one phone call
you get one call
the cop locks the dial on the phone
phreak waits for the cop to leave and hangs up
he starts rapidly pushing the hangup hook and he hears a ringing tone
hello operator services
im having trouble dialing a number
what number please
just one moment
hey its me
joey wasnt making it up
he really hacked into ellingson
he gave me the disc with a file he copied and now im in jail
theyre charging me with some serious shit
and theres stuff i didnt even do like inserting some virus called da vinci and they keep asking about you guys
you think theyre going to bust us
you better figure out whats on that disc cause were being framed
its in that place where i put that thing that time
he hangs up just as the cop returns
kate is entirely out of place in the boys room as the boys look on amusedly
she finds the disc behind the condom machine and pockets it
then she buys a condom from the machine and struts out smiling sweetly hot as fire
murphy lets kate and cereal in
looking kate over well now i see what all the fuss is about
she shows them to dades room dade
you have company
its a nice room
we need your help
do my ears deceive me
kate starts to leave
truce you guys
listen we got a higher purpose here alright
a wake up call for the nintendo generation
we demand free access to data well it comes with some responsibility
when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish
its corinthians i chapter verse no duh
phreak and joey are being framed
we need your help to figure out whats on this disc
everybody who touches that thing gets busted i cant afford to get arrested im sorry
maybe i should just go to the bathroom or something
cereal leaves the room
what is it with you
i know weve been playing games but were supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help
i really need your help
im sorry i cant
well could you just make a copy of the disc
and just hide it in case we get busted so we have something to give our lawyers something that hasnt been tampered with
can you do that
a knock on the door
dades mom peeks in
listen you guys help yourself to anything in the fridge
murphy thank you
ill copy it
okay thank you
plague phones dade
plague has lauren murphys records on his screen
the girl has the disc i need
i told you i dont play well with others
turn on your laptop
set it to receive a file
an extensive criminal record with a strange womans picture comes up
the strange woman transforms into dades mother
lauren murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of washington
forgery embezzlement two drug convictions plus she jumped parole
when shes arrested she will not have a trial she will not pass go she will go directly to jail
then i change this file back to the original and your mom disappears
what can i tell you
computers never lie kid
your mom will be arrested at work shell be handcuffed and later strip searched
you lay a finger on her and ill kill you
kid dont threaten me
there are worse things than death and uh i can do all of them
dade emerges from his room
his exhausted overworked mother is asleep on the couch
he pulls a blanket over her
shortly after dade is outside on a payphone
talk to me
i got it
but listen kate didnt know whats on it
i mean she came to me to figure it out
shes not the one who planted the virus
you leave her alone
hey dont worry kid
if shes innocent shell be fine
your mommys safe now okay
dade hangs up and waits for some time
a limousine drives by with a skateboarder tailing
plague grabs the disc jumps in the limo and speeds away
dade tries to chase but gives up quickly
dade shows up
kate nikon and cereal are working on the disc
uh hold on
i have to tell you something
hold on a second
look at this its so lean and clean
looks like a hacker wrote it
come here look at this
this thing is dense
nikon points out part of the code
but thats ill man
this is taking forever and a day to figure out
im gonna make some coffee
dade takes nikons place
tag youre in
dade studies and reverse engineers the garbage file
the other hackers watch and do just about anything but be hackers
finally over boxes of half finished pizza dade makes an announcement
this isnt a virus
its a worm
whats this one eat
you see this
dade indicates a rapidly scrolling data display
this is every financial transaction ellingson conducts yeah
from million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas
the worm eats a few cents from each transaction
and no ones caught it because the money isnt really gone
its just data being shifted around
and when the worms ready it zips out with the money and erases its tracks
joey got cut off before he got to that part
check it out
by this point its already running at what twice the speed as when it started
right and at this rate it ends its run in
and judging by this segment alone its already eaten about
million bucks man
whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall
and thats phreak and thats joey and thats us
weve got to get the rest of the file so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears so we can find out who created
i know i know who wrote it
this ellingson security creep
i gave him a copy of the disc you gave me
i didnt know what was on it
agitated oh man
thats universally stupid man
yo man you an amateur man
why did he come to you
i got a record
i was zero cool
crashed fifteen hundred and seven systems in one day
nikon closes his eyes and access his photographic memory
biggest crash in history front page new york times august th
i thought you was black man
yo man this is zero cool
thats far out
this is zero cool man
coldly well thats great
there goes mit
ill make it up to you
ill hack the gibson
theyll trace you like that snaps his fingers man cops are gonna find you theyre gonna find you with a smoking gun
fucked if i care man
look even if you had the passwords itll take you ten minutes to get in and youve still gotta find the files man i mean the cops will have you
oh wow we are fried
suddenly lighter hearted never send a boy to do a womans job
with me we can do it in seven
youre both screwed
i help we can do it in six
jesus i gotta save all your asses
i help we can do it in five minutes man
lets go shopping
dade and kate cut through a chain link fence and jump into a dumpster at ellingson
kate lands on dade
you know if i didnt live by a strict code of honor i might take advantage of this situation
erotically as it were
kate fishes around in her pants never breaking eye contact with dade
she pulls out a flashlight
they start trashing
they get up to leave and are spotted by a security guard
alright hold it right there
kate pulls out a flare gun and fires it at the security guard
its my subway defense system
nikon is staring down a manhole cereal is fishing through an adjacent phone company truck
hes way down there
cereal emerges with a beltload of equipment and a hard hat
but he forgot the most important thing
yo brain dead the manual
cereal goes back to the truck and gets a thick manual
the phone company technician comes up from the manhole
in unison pointing down the street the phone company tech jumps back in the hole cereal and nikon take off
a woman is seated at the desk
agent gill walks by
cereal emerges from the desk between her legs
his tool belt dangles obscenely from his crotch
the problem must be somewhere else
cereal walks away with his buttcrack seriously showing
nikon poses as a flower delivery boy
he winds his way through the offices of ellingson mineral shoulder surfing watching the workers entering passwords
his photographic memory captures everything
the plague walks past him noticing briefly but not making the connection
the da vinci virus launch cancel prompt is up
pacing they had a large chunk of the garbage file
how much do they know
but enough to implicate us
you said the worm was untreaceable
but theyre hackers
but dont worry
all we have to do is launch the da vinci virus and then theyll all be put away
launch the da vinci virus
you cant do that
no one believes the guilty
besides by the time they realize the truth well be long gone with all of our money
margo starts to protest
look there is no right and wrong
there is only fun and boring
a thirty year prison sentence sounds pretty dull to me
who do you prefer serves it us
plague clicks on launch
the virus repeats its demand
unless five million dollars are transferred to the following numbered account in seven days i will capsize five tankers in the ellingson fleet
as the virus speaks a supertanker sails on a choppy sea
plague leaves a message on gills answering machine
sternly the virus goes off tomorrow morning at and those hackers tried to get into our system again
at this point i insist you take more strenuous action or ellingson mineral will hold the secret service responsible
gill gets on the phone
grimly get me arrest warrants on kate libby alias acid burn emmanuel goldstein alias cereal killer dade murphy alias crash override also known as zero cool and paul cook alias
we pick them up tomorrow morning at nine oclock
as gill gives the order a mysterious device under his desk blinks
cereal put it there
nikon and cereal taped gills orders
snoop onto them
as they snoop onto us
nikon calls kate
yeah its kate
we got a little problem here
cereal nikon dade and kate skate through a run down subway platform and get on the a train
they go over the results of their password gathering spree
alright so what have we got
well we have fifty passwords plus whatever polaroid head here got inside ellingson
well i got a lot alright
i dont know how many but
my head hurts
yo everyone check this out
hey whats the da vinci virus
check this out
its a memo about how theyre gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth
what oil spills
yo brain dead today is the thirteenth
well this hasnt happened yet
wait a minute the fourteenth thats the same day the worm ends its run
da vinci virus didnt phreak say thats what he was being charged with
quotes the memo infecting ballast programs of ellingson tankers they blame hackers
a worm and a virus
the plot thickens
kate gets ready to get off the subway
whoa whoa whoa whoa where are you going huh
i got an idea
weve got a few hours right till we get arrested
so just stay low
im gonna go get some help
ill beep you okay
to dade are you coming
dade gets up
may the force be with you man
weird music plays lots of weird people dance
razor and blade are on stage dancing in front of a huge speaker
there they are
razor and blade
lets get em
dade and kate push through the crowd
the song changes to a fast industrial rap number razor and blade leave the stage and dade starts getting moshed
he climbs on the stage to follow razor and blade
for his trouble he is thrown back onto the crowd who pass him around overhead
finally the crowd lets him go
he catches up with kate
i lost em
where were you
dade tries to explain but is at a loss for words
they make their way to the entrance to razor and blades lair
video monitors are everywhere
i dont like this
a robotic arm with a revolver swings around to point at dade
i definitely dont like this
through video intercom what do you want
we come in peace
dade winces at his own corniness
we need your help
if youre up to it
lets keep her
waste the dude
the gun goes off
its only a cigarette lighter
no one can accuse razor and blade of not having a sense of humor
a virus called da vinci will cause oil spills at am eastern time tomorrow
its somehow connected with the worm thats stealing the money
we need your help to overload the gibson so we can kill the da vinci virus and download the worm program
shes rabid but cute
see were very busy
a tv network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show
noticing the stench of sellout lets go kate
nobody said no
but you are going to need more than just two media icons like us
you need an army
an electronic army
if i were us id get on the internet send out a major distress signal
hackers of the world unite
how are you going to take care of the cops
dade just smiles
dade hacks into the city traffic light control system
suddenly there is gridlock on the streets of new york city
nikon is playing chess against two hassidic jews
cereals beeper goes off
it displays the message yo
im blowing up
its kate grand central
lets hit it
nikon checkmates his opponent and the two leave
dade cereal nikon and kate skate through the streets
dades program to freeze all the traffic lights on green runs on schedule at precisely
picture new york city in morning rush hour and every traffic light is green
instant gridlock ensues
the four skate through the traffic easily while the secret service now pursuing them is stuck
gill punches a parked car in frustration
its alarm goes off
the four hackers skate into grand central station and head to the lowest level
they meet up with joey
hey joey you made it
the hackers are now setting up laptops at a bank of pay phones
dade is wearing a pirate eye eyepiece
now listen up use your best viruses to buy us time we have to get into plagues file and copy the worm
boom boom aiaiaiaiaee
alright that was a little tension breaker that had to be done alright
go fix the phones
cereal takes off to fix the phones
joey take his place
take his place man do it
you can do it
joey takes cereals place
alright lets boot up
the four boot up their machines
various vanity screens come up on the laptops
they begin to hack
we see the inside of the gibson
viruses of all kinds begin to pour in
in the offices and data processing rooms the ellingson staff are in pandemonium
happy faces with eye patches appear on their screens
sit on my interface
shit for brains
arf arf arf
the big monitor shows the attack in progress
what is it
nothing its just a minor glitch
minor glitch with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe
the main screen is filled with theres a new virus in the database
its replicating eating up memory
what do i do
type cookie you idiot
ill head em off at the pass
another virus appears
we have a zero bug attacking all the login and overlay files
run anti virus
give me a systems display
the systems display comes up
red flashes everywhere signifying new attacks
plague presses a key
the rabbit is in the administration system
rabbit icons start to fill the systems display
send a flu shot
rabbit flu shot someone talk to me
a rabbit replicates till it overloads a file then it spreads like cancer
the da vinci virus sings row row row your boat
tanker ballasts start filling for real
its the gibson its finding us too fast
man theres too many garbage files i need more time
theyre at grand central station lower level
dont screw up
the secret service and nypd are stuck
they turn around and head for grand central station
the public phone next to dades rings
its the plague
last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence
youre not good enough to beat me you little shit
yeah maybe im not
but we are you asshole
give it up
just give it up
kates phone rings
are we fashionably late
hackers in england italy japan russia everywhere mobilize and start attacking the ellingson gibson
the english hacker looks and talks suspiciously like annie lennoxs husband
our heroes relentlessly search for the right garbage file
we have massive infection
multiple gpi and fsi viruses
theyre coming in from remote nodes
theyre going after the kernal
the system command processor its the brain
duke ellingson arrives
belford whats going on
in short duke a shit storm
dozens of armed secret service and swat troops push through the crowded station looking for the hackers
the garbage file lights up
the familiar psychedelic swirl of equations and fractal graphics returns
i found it
i found it
this is the end my friend
smiling sickly thank you for calling
dade is disconnected
he got me
joeys getting stupid busy
the ss and swat are still closing in on the hackers
i need you to drop your viruses go after the worm
youre the closest
the ss and swat push through crowds
its root slash period workspace slash period garbage period
the ss are nearly there
joey has found the file
the ss arrive
gill himself has his
its an empty bank of payphones the receivers are linked together and taped up
they keep going
pissed off but determined ahhh come on
joey completes the download
to razor and blade kill the gibson
come on you son of a bitch is that all you got huh
come on lets see what else you can do
you talking to me
are you nuts
come at me
margo and duke are awed by plagues imminent failure and total unprofessionalism
theyre in the kernal
the da vinci virus dies
the tankers stop capsizing and right themselves
off screen the tankers have stopped capsizing
off screen ballast tanks are emptying
itll be okay
the main screen lights up little pissant
the gibson dies in a flash of light
the hackers cheer and congratulate each other
we did it
lets get out of here
the ss have caught up with the hackers
agent bob seems to be choosing which pore on which hackers face to blow away first
only joey thinks to put his hands up
as they are led away a handcuffed dade surrreptitiously tosses the disc with the worm into a trashcan
outside he notices cereal who wasnt present to be arrested
he yells to the crowd but really is addressing cereal
theyre trashing our rights man
theyre trashing the flow of data
shut up and get in the car
understanding the hidden message later cereal is trashing through the garbage cans in grand central station
eventually he finds the disc
to cereals disgust it has gum stuck to it
gill phones the plague to report the successful takedown
we caught em
you wont be having any more trouble from them
at plagues place plague and margo toast with champagne giggle and then scurry off to bed
dade and kate are there
i did it
she knows shit about computers
shes just my girlfriend
laughing i suggest you modify your attitude
because you are floating
and im about to flush your ass
the intercom beeps
youve got a mrs
murphy to see you sir
are you crazy
what are you doing
im trying to help you
she pauses realizing his gesture
thanks for your help
dade turns on the intercom
gill can be heard through it
grimly your son is in big trouble
he has violated his probation and he has engaged in criminal activity
my son happens to be a genius
he understands something happening today that you wont comprehend if you live to be a hundred and he would never use what he knows to harm a living soul
agent bob enters
the news crew you requested is here
cause i have a few things to tell them
your son is facing thirty felony counts in an ongoing investigation
you face possible arrest if you do that
mister i dont care if i face certain death
murphy stays right here
oh wow shes great
the news crew interviews gill
and attacked the ellingsons computer network
is the last weve seen of this type of high tech espionage
well im afraid not
hackers are a grave threat to the national security
this incident just proves without a doubt that we need increased funding to stop
nikon and joey are led in
the monitors cut into static then cereal appears
that kid cut him off
hold on boys and girls
it is i the cereal killer making my first coast to coast world wide global television appearance
yes thats right im here to tell you about this heinous scheme hatched from within ellingson mineral
razor and blade busily work on keeping him on the air
but for what you ask
something far more tacky
a virus called da vinci that when launched would cause ellingson mineral tankers to capsize was to be blamed on innocent hackers
but this virus was really the smokescreen right
what could be so vitally important to protect that someone would create such a nasty antisocial very uncool virus program
cereal is now seen and heard on the big screen in times square
could it be to cover the tracks for this worm program
a worm that was to steal million bucks
the password for this hungry little sucker belongs to margo wallace head of public relations at ellingson mineral
margo watches this and sits bolt upright in bed
oh my god
continuing and eugene belford computer security officer
finally understanding whats been going on all along son of a bitch
continuing whats this
is this the unnamed account in the bahamas where the money was to be stashed
i think so
an account number scrolls below cereals chin
i kinda feel like god
his voice echoes across the earth and among the satellites
almost supernaturally plague is already gone
he was right next to her stark naked in bed a second ago
the hackers embrace and congratulate each other again lauren murphy hugs her son
margo wallace has been arrested and is being led into the womens lockup
some of the other women grab at her expensive italian leather jacket as she is led to her cell
i dont even know how to work a vcr let alone a computer
look listen ill make a deal
i know where his mother is i promise you
get offa me
i need a lawyer
here you are mr
flight time to tokyo should be about hours today
can i get you anything else
babbage is the plague in disguise he now appears about years old
just a pillow please
the pillow slides in behind his head he reaches up to adjust it
a handcuff snaps onto his wrist
whats going on
let go of me
ill never fly this airline again
dade and kate are on their date
dade is smartly somewhat androgynously dressed
kate is heavily made up and yes she is wearing a dress
you look good in a dress
you would have looked better
wanna go for a swim
dade and kate swimming fully clothed in a pool on a roof
i cant believe they decided you won
the guys felt it was the only way id get a date
anyway youre pretty good
you know if you would have said so in the beginning you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble
they look out at the skyline
suddenly the lights in three buildings change
they spell out kate laughs honestly impressed
kate continues laughing
you know ive been having these really weird
finishing his sentence dreams
they kiss passionately
