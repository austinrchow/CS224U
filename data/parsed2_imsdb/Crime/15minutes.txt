b if window
href b b minutes on the words czech airline
we are panning across the words on the side of the plane
on a tray table
crumpled czech bills and coins are on it
hands are counting the money
the airline hostess announces the arrival at jfk in czech
a hand reaches into a breast pocket pulling out two passports
one is opened
belongs to emil slovak
the next passport belongs to oleg razgul
the hand passes the oleg razgul passport to the man next to him
we notice several empty airline bottles of vodka and a small disposable camera on olegs tray table
the passport is set down
oleg picks it up
we hear emils voice in czech
the scene is subtitled in english

camera dollies down a long line of passengers
they are split into two lines one for americans the other for visitors
camera finally arrives at emil slovak
an unshaven czech in his mid s
tall scraggly beard
piercing blue eyes

his eyes are alert cunning and smart
oleg razgul stands in line behind emil
oleg is big

a wrestlers body
emil looks at oleg

oleg holds up his disposable camera at arms length to take a picture of himself

emil looks at oleg pissed
the place is empty except for one table at the end of the bar
eddie flemming manhattans most famous detective and his savvy black partner leon jackson are having cocktails
eddie is smoothly handsome tough smart and tired
not only is he the best homicide detective manhattan has ever seen hes continually mentioned in new york columns and has been the subject of several magazine articles
theres even been a tv movie about one of his biggest cases
leon has been with eddie a long time and was also featured in the tv movie

paulie delivers the drinks and sets some cigars on the table

eddie asks hawkins

how old are you

leon and hawkins sit back down as eddie and paulie leave
so you got your kids listening to opera
you still singing in the church on the weekends
now other officers are questioning emil and oleg
theyve been there a while
the secondary officer is looking oleg
you work in a vodka factory
i understand that
to emil and what kind of work do you do
i am butcher
youre a butcher
what do you use pig intestines for
you stuff sausage in it
and what do you do with the bones
emil looks at oleg
blaming his stupid responses at passport control for their detainment
are you married
are you proposing
through a thousand ice cubes
a face plunges towards us
eddie has his back to us as he dunks his face into a sink full of ice
he dries his face looks into his bloodshot eyes
presents a small black ring box to the mirror
will you marry me
wanna get married
what are you doin saturday
im gonna propose
eddie leans back and drops some visine in his eyes
the thrill of the hunt
i love it
oleg and emil stare at the bright lights all the nonstop action
each stands with an old suitcase
in russian look
just like in the movies
in czech dont speak russian
in russian why
why do i always have to speak to you in czech
in czech because i dont like your ugly language
i heard enough of it in school
now speak czech or english
and dont fool around anymore
you almost got us thrown out
emil pulls out an envelope with milos address on it
this is who they came to see
emil hails a cab
oleg is staring inside a camera store at himself on a monitor
a videocameras pointed out in the street
we have no money
oleg stares at the videocamera dying to have one like this
emil slides into the cab
where you wanna go buddy
emil pulls out the post marked envelope
points to the return address on it and passes it through the slot to the cabbie
emil looks out the window no sign of oleg
then oleg hurries out the camera store gripping something inside his coat
he flings both suitcases in the trunk slams it shut and jumps in the back seat
he opens his jacket pulling out the videocamera he just stole
oleg smiles sheepishly at emil
eddies car pulls up
eddie leon and hawkins get out
so whats unique
eddie passes hawkins a polaroid of a woman on a bed covered in blood
hes from antigua
his girlfriend was taking too long to put her make up on
they were late for a party
stabbed her with a beer bottle
and he still went to the party
leon moves to a lookout gives him a twenty
i make big cases they make the news and i look good
but the problem with becoming a star is downtown
they shoot at stars
now be quiet
as they reach the doorway eddie surprises two crackheads
waves them off
they hurry away
i hope this prick doesnt run
my knees are killing me
stay behind me
youre worried for my safety
eddie flattens against the building watches unique descend the fire escape
keep them out of my way
eddie closes in
into his cell phone unique is climbing down the fire escape before he gets to the bottom leon bursts through a door behind him and kicks the fire escape sending
unique flying into the alley
where he lands dropping his gun
eddie pulls him off the ground as leon scoops the gun up
whats your rush
going to a party
why you chasin me man
i dont know
you always come outta your house that way
its not my house man
i dont live here
well sounds like burglary to me
leon cuffs unique who recognizes eddie
i know you man
an unmarked van comes tearing into the scene
disgorges a mini cam team that starts filming but they missed the bust
to eddie any chance we can do that again
i didnt wanna do it the first time
the cab is in front of an old five story brownstone
oleg gets the bags out of the trunk as emil tucks the envelope into his jacket then steps up to the old building
he looks back at oleg whos videotaping him
turn that off
get the bags
why should i carry your bag
i am not a dog
for five years i paid for your stupidness youll carry my bag for the rest of my life if i say so
challenging unless you refuse oleg
oleg looks at emil
even though oleg is stronger than emil he fears him
he picks up both bags
emil searches the occupant list over the buzzers to the apartment building
emil pushes ten of the buzzers except rw
a buzzer clicks and emil pushes it open
the brownstone has no elevator so emil and oleg climb the stairs
oleg cradling his camera
emil notices a crack pipe on the floor and picks it up
smells the bowl
smell like chemicals
for smoking drugs
emil pockets the pipe and climbs to the top floor moving down the dirty hallway to a corner door
the door is opened by milos a year old czech dressed in stained plumbers overalls
he is surprised to see emil and oleg in his doorway
oleg films him
milos shoots a look across the tiny kitchen to tamina his comely wife
emil pushes his way inside
milos wears plumbers overalls but emil notices sports a rolex
tamina has on a faded dress but despite their cheaply furnished apartment she wears an expensive brushed gold necklace bracelet and big pearl earrings
the room is furnished with kitsch from disney world and las vegas
the only anomaly is a huge sony trinitron home entertainment center
the following is in czech and subtitled in english
your sister said she didnt know where you were so you shouldnt write to her with return address if youre hiding
did you hurt her
you know me
i never hurt anybody
wheres the money
oleg is looking tamina over
milos though scared barks at oleg
take your eyes off her oleg
to emil look
it wasnt my fault you two were caught
of oleg its his fault
trying to get the bank clerks phone number
i wasnt going to wait
get my money
oleg videotapes the scene
all we see behind it is a womans face and her wet hair she obviously came from the shower and we see the towel wrapped around her
nervously we spent it
look at the way we live
im a plumber
you think id be working if i had money
emil pissed moves to a wood block and pulls out a kitchen knife
he grabs tamina roughly putting the blade to her throat
put down the knife
milos looks at his wife who is terrified
ill help you
milos closes the gap between him and emil trying to calm him by talking softly
i can get you a job
yes the money is good
as a plumber
its easy to learn
as a plumber
you think i come to america to work
we started over you can too
furious you spent all the money while i was in prison
now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets
emil pulls the knife away from tamina then angrily plunges it toward milos chest
oleg videotapes it
then lowers the camera shocked that emil killed milos
blood sprays taminas face
she tries to run but oleg grabs her not noticing her brushed gold bracelet falls to the floor
he covers her mouth as he points the videocamera at emil who stabs tamina absolutely enraged
emil hears noise in the bedroom a window opening
emil kicks the bedroom door open
sees the window leading to the fire escape
he dashes to it
sees four flights down the woman wearing a summer dress
her hair still wet
she looks up
she is beautiful and terrified
she runs down the alley
emil hurries toward the bathroom
she just got out of the shower
her underwear and purse are draped over a chair
emil grabs the purse
finds a czechoslovakian passport
he opens the cover stares at her photo and name
theres one stamp in the passport from the u
when she arrived june
underneath is written month stay
emil flips through the rest of the passport all blank pages
six month visa
still here two years later
theyll deport her if she goes to police
emil pockets daphnes passport and wallet scoops up her shoes and jacket enters the kitchen and dumps them on the floor
he tears through the kitchen cabinets throwing cans and bottles aside
what are you looking for
emil finds nail polish remover looks at the bodies
im going to make a bohemian barbecue
emil draws the kitchen curtains plunging the room into darkness
a face comes from the darkness
its an athletically handsome man jogging out of a tunnel towards us
hes in a tie and jacket in central park at night
he is jordan jordy warsaw
a sensitive man of rugged honesty
he runs down the hill in a hurry
a mugger steps in his path
got any spare change
how bout a spare twenty
look i dont have time for you get out of my way
alright how bout all your fuckin money
the mugger pulls a knife and in a whirl of movement jordy grabs his wrist and disarms him in a deadly professional manner hurling him down to the pavement twisting
his arm behind his back
with his other hand jordy whips out a browning mm from his shoulder holster and places it behind the muggers head
jordy displays his shield
okay youre under arrest
now you happy
firemen dont carry guns
jordy handcuffs the mugger and searches the muggers coat pockets pulling out a handful of drivers licenses and credit cards
nice how many people you ripped off tonight
as jordy yanks the mugger to his feet his beeper goes off
you couldnt listen to me could you
jordy drags the mugger to a tree
cuffs him so his face is pressed up against the bark
ill send a cop back for you
cmon you cant leave me like this
some freakll come by and stab me
jordy jogs off across the park
fire trucks from three battalions
theres a crowd growing
jordy pushes his way through
the top floor of the brownstone where milos and tamina lived has been reduced to smoking ruins
the trees are covered in debris and soot
jordy moves to louie battalion chief
lieutenant take up your line and relieve ladder company on the top floor
hey louie were you first due
yeah i radioed you guys right away cause you got two roasts on the top floor but you dont hafta investigate cause homicide is up there
who let them up
i didnt make it a crime scene yet
hey its eddie flemming
bobby korfin an overweight arson investigator with a quick with and good sense of humor comes over pulling on a turnout coat
where you been man
we got a celebrity
who the hell let them up there
i dont know you think eddie will give me his autograph
you see anything in the crowd
naw im sure the suspects not here
oh yeah why
cause eddie woulda locked him up by now
the roof is gone
the sky is exposed
its charred ruins smoked beams and watery muck
eddie and leon are standing by whats left of the mattress looking at milos and taminas charred bodies
eddie grips a half smoked cuban cigar listening to leon
so it looks to me from the sixty nine position that they were doin each other but were so whacked out of their heads they set the pipe on the
mattress lit it up and they got fried
what do you think eddie
jordy enters with korfin whos carrying a paint can
i dont know
we got the experts here
show them what you found i hope you dont mind we came over to see if we could help
korfin makes a beeline for eddie wanting to meet the celebrity
nah not at all
detective flemming bobby korfin
my uncle tony worked with you at back when you were a rookie
could you put out the cigar
part of the job is picking up scents
eddie puts his cigar out
carefully slides it into a cigar holder and pockets it to finish later
well i found check it out crack pipe
looks like they got careless
leon displays the pipe emil found on the stairs
korfin shines the flashlight on leon to look at the pipe
mind not shining that light in my eyes
hey thats great you guys got it all wrapped up but you dont mind if we go through the routine
it gives us somethin to do
no we dont mind
you mind leon
jordy throws a look at korfin
homicide detectives have no respect for fire marshals investigative skills
eddie rummages through the apartment moving into the kitchen and living room
leon watches as korfin sticks a pencil in a charred beam measuring how deep in it goes
okay jordy it was a fast fire we got good patterns about thirty minutes old
jordy moves to one of the corpses
he pulls on a white rubber glove
inserts his finger in the corpses mouth
the glove comes out white
mouths clean too
dont blow your nose
jordys looking at leon who was just about to blow his nose
the smokell permeate your nostrils burn em out
let it run
but you knew that right
leon looks at jordy then lowers the handkerchief
jordy turns back to the corpses on the bed
eddie in the other room has found taminas brushed gold bracelet on the floor
so the way you see it two crack heads burned themselves up
thats what it looks like to me
and while theyre burning up theyre still goin down on each other
you got to hand it to them
realizes hes wrong blows it off yeah well some people got their priorities straight
leon watches jordy quietly
with a pair of tweezers jordy pulls a small unburned piece of cloth from behind one of the heads
korfin supplies the paint can
jordy drops the cloth inside
what was that
of a homicide
that got eddies attention and he comes back to the bedroom
you know what that is right
no what is it
why dont you explain it bobby
to a fireman joking a wall hey camello
you mind punching a hole in the floor
to eddie and leon excuse me gentlemen
you might wanna back up a little more
dont wanna get your pants wet
leon and eddie move to higher ground on top of a burnt tv set
eddie hands the brushed bracelet to leon
as camello hacks at the floor with an ax jordy continues to examine the bodies and korfin explains they have not soot in their mouths which means they werent breathin
before the fire and that usually means they were deceased and this piece of cloth that my partner found means they were wrapped up in something probably doused with a flammable liquid and positioned like this on the bed
to the untrained eye it looks like an accident
jordy kicks around the draining floor reaches down for something
whats he looking for
jordy finds some wires attached to an outlet pulls them up on the other end is a timer
korfin takes the timer from jordy and moves to eddie
here you go
a big double homicide
as jordy and korfin exit the brownstone a camera crew is arriving
korfin and jordy cross toward korfins car
they open the trunk
take off their muddy boots throwing them in
you see eddies face when i gave him the timer
wish i had a picture of it
he knew all along
thats why he was so quiet
he was testing us
eddie and leon exit eddie carrying a baggie with a timer inside
nicolette karas young and attractive pushes her microphone at eddie
shes smart aggressive and respected by her peers
detective does it look like a murder
we dont know that yet
its much too early
theres a lot to be done
how many victims are up there
there are two bodies found at this point
can we go up to the crime scene
you know you cant do that
is it drug related
we dont know
when i have more ill let you know
nicolette signals for her camera man mike to zoom in on eddies hand
she barrels on
whats that youre holding in your hand
mike pans up to eddies face
other reporters arrive hurling questions which eddie easily answers
cameras flash as we pan back to korfin and jordy
jordy is about to get in the car as he notices back behind some construction daphne handlova
shes still wearing the crumpled summer dress
she tentatively steps out to signal jordy
he only catches a glimpse of her
he starts toward her knifes through the crowd but daphne is gone
there was a woman i think she wanted to talk to us
she looked scared
korfins car screeches to a stop
jordy leaps out
suddenly jordy stops
the mugger handcuffed to the tree is now naked
you motherfuckin bastard
she stripped me
it was a bag lady
she touched me all over it was disgusting
jordy unlocks the handcuffs
im really sorry
korfin delivers a blanket
jordy covers him
a dog pissed on me
im gonna sue you for this
you violated my civil rights
your civil rights
you tried to rob me
i could arrest you right now
youre lucky youre walking away from this
now get outta here
jordy gives him a push
the mugger wraps the blanket around himself cursing hurrying away
exhausted hookers who have worked all night loiter outside a sleazy hotel
camera pans up to a blinking hotel sign
the light is blinking an eerie green and yellow light into the room
emil is at the window pulling the blind down trying to shut out the blinking light
he pulls it down twice and it pops back up both times
the third time he angrily pulls it so hard it comes off the window completely
he sits down in a chair in frustration adjusting a pillow behind his back
the roseanne show is on tv
roseanne has been talking to a father
so you slept with your sons wife
whats that all about
i take full responsibility for sleepin with my daughter in law
i had low self esteem i thought i had to compete with him
emil reaches for his dictionary
mutters self esteem
he flips through his dictionary to find the meaning of self esteem
losin my job and everything caused my behavioral disorder
turns to his son forgive me kirk
let me hug you
the audience boos
oleg fresh from the shower with wet hair sits on the bed in his skivvies staring into the videocameras lcd screen rewinding milos murder
we see it now for the first time as he rewinds it
oleg watches a bottle of cheap vodka between his legs
emil looks up from his dictionary
hes wearing milos rolex
taminas jewelry her brushed gold necklace and pearl earrings are in front of him with daphnes wallet
emil looks up oleg is holding his videocamera
czech turn that fucking thing off
czech im not filming
im watching milos die
its just like a move but realer
emil grabs the videocamera
czech dont break it
dont break it
english you said speak czech
how you erase this
ill do it
dont hurt my camera
emil tosses the camera back to oleg who drops his vodka bottle in order to catch the camera
oleg holding the camera like its gold goes to the dresser and puts it away
emil starts to go through daphnes wallet
i didnt want to kill him
noticing whats this
emil found the last card in the wallet
its pink with a picture of a busty globe
printed in the middle is worldly escorts and a number
emil picks up his dictionary and begins to flip the pages finding the meaning of worldly
he gets up and dials the number
a soft sexy voice answers
soft music in the background
are you looking for companionship
oleg whos listening moves to emil
you have eastern european girl
a czech girl
matter of fact i have a lovely czech girl
i take her
korfins car pulls up to the station as a fire engine is returning
now that you know him maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him
maybe you can be his stand in
the men are pulling off their equipment coming down from the high of fighting a fire
korfin and jordy walk toward the tv room
the tv is on in the background
we can see nicolette interviewing eddie
he holds up the paint can
what the hell is that
you gave eddie flemming the evidence
deputy chief fire marshal declan duffy the head of the arson squad comes over
duffys tough irish and very political
pointing to the tv who did cause and origin

what was that korfin
i said yeah youre right chief
as soon as we get somethin well let you alert the media

they all head upstairs
the chief jordy and korfin enter
there are posters of pyros arsonists and terrorists on the walls
garcia a puerto rican investigator looks up from his desk
hey guys i got your torch

a scruffy unshaven white man sitting across from garcia turns
he is max a pyromaniac in his s with a freshly scratched cross etched in his forehead

as the top story logo is splashed across the screen accompanied by a catchy tv theme robert hawkins introduces americas highest rated news magazine show
good evening im robert hawkins and this is top story
tonight we bring you an exclusive interview with stephen geller who horrified the nation two years ago when he went berserk and murdered three clerks in a manhattan shoe store
but now mr
gellers claim spoken softly and articulately is that he is the victim
according to mr
geller the events of that fateful day were not his fault but were the fault of his psychiatrist
hard to believe
videocamera slowly zooms out and pans over to emil sitting on the hotel bed watching the tv
he looks at us
olegs hand reaches in front of the lens turning up the volume
the scene cuts back to stephen geller being interviewed by robert hawkins and his camera crew
hes sitting on the front lawn of a mental institution in a paint stained shirt
a showing of his artwork is displayed in the background
patients peruse the paintings of weird dysfunctional faces that avoid eye contact
one of the paintings depicts eddie flemming and leon jackson
this had nothing to do with shoes that didnt fit or my relationship with my father who as you know made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties
these people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor
my psychiatrist didnt insist that i stay on my medication
so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people
it was my finger that pulled the trigger but im not morally responsible
my psychiatrist knew what i was capable of
how could i know
im not a doctor
you seem very savvy for a man whos been found mentally incompetent to stand trial
look im a victim here too
i was a year away from getting my masters in art now ill never graduate
my life has been permanently disrupted
arent you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money
hasnt this incident as you call it jump started your career as an artist
look im in here
you call this a career move
and isnt there a movie in the works about you
were in negotiations thats correct
but doesnt the son of sam law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes
that doesnt apply to me because im not a criminal
im not a criminal
i wasnt convicted
emil leans forward listening
i love america
no one is responsible for what they do
theres a knock on the door
our videocamera pov swings over to it
then whips back to emil
emil looks at us
get in the bathroom
whatever we do we fuck her right
oleg get in bathroom stay there and shut up
emil turns off the tv
our pov backs into the bathroom closing the door but leaving it open a crack
emil looks down at his shoe
the pov pans down to the kitchen knife sticking out of emils boot
emils hands pull his pants cuff over it
pov pans up to emil as he moves to the door and opens it
its not daphne and shes not world class
hi im honey
wheres czech girl
baby im anybody you want me to be
im a little schoolgirl im mommy im a czech girl
closes the door behind her
now i like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure
why dontchya put my money on the dresser
i ordered a czech girl
daphne you know her
oleg zooms in for a close up of honey
during the rest of the scene oleg films her
honey begins to undress
its an outcall service run out of an apartment
i dont meet the other girls
arent you gonna get undressed
where is escort service
could you put the money on the dresser
i like to talk to the person who runs the service
can you give me address
do we have a problem here
theres no reason to have a problem
im gonna make you feel real good
you wanna czech girl
after im done with you you wont miss her
now why dont you pay me
she starts to unfasten emils belt
stopping her listen to me
i dont want sex
just give me the address and then you go
suddenly hard as nails look man i dont give a shit if you want sex or not but youre payin for my time
emil pulls the knife out of his boot and shoves her against the door pushing the blade against her throat suddenly furious like he was before killing milos and tamina
give me the address
alright alright dont hurt me
please its in my book in my purse
emil backs off as she reaches for her purse and comes out with a can of mace spraying emils face
emil stumbles backwards oleg holding him in the frame
he whip pans back to honey as she grabs her clothes unlocking the door but emils hand slams it shut
emil turns blindly rubbing his burning eyes guarding the door
honey darts toward the bathroom she pushes open the door and runs into oleg who is videotaping her
horrified she turns around as emil smashes her in the face so hard she topples backwards tripping into the bathtub pulling the shower curtain down on her
like a panther out for the kill emil pounces
oleg films as emil lifts his hand gripping
as emils hand comes flying down then rises up bloodied
her screams are muffled by the shower curtain wrapped around her face
oleg films the scene as the knife plunges down daphne a sketch of her face
her lips are fuller than that
you can see em a mile away
food containers are scattered all over the place
the female composite artist looks at jordy
stacks of failed sketches sit beside her
what about her cheek bones
her cheek bones are prominent and her eyes were huge
big blue eyes and when i saw her she looked scared
like she was looking to get away
but she was absolutely beautiful
the composite artist looks at jordy
i gotta good look at her
korfin has his chair turned around from his desk and is watching the sketch evolve as he speaks on the phone to the landlord of the th street brownstone
garcia is also on the phone
the other investigators are gone
working late into the night
its almost dawn
and how long have they been livin in your building
writes years on his pad alright ill be in touch when we know somethin
to jordy milos and tamina karlova
they were quiet and kept to themselves
landlord dont know who your girl is
how long they been livin here
you hear that question garcia
yeah i got immigration on the phone theyve been here illegally
well theyre definitely permanent residents now
i got the owner of the plumbing company milos worked for
why dont we get some sleep and well go see him in the morning
you go home
im takin your car and goin back to the crime scene
arent you tired
if i go home i wont be able to fall asleep anyway
jordy takes the sketch of daphne which isnt a bad likeness and heads for the door
korfin falls in behind him
as they pass garcia he hands jordy the address
of the picture she keepin you up
like to meet her huh
shed make you forget your ex wife
cure your insomnia
camera descends from the sky picking up jordy as he enters what is left of milos and taminas apartment
the roof has been burned off
he moves into the next room trying to see through the darkness looking through the muck and char
okay to smoke
jordy turns surprised
eddie sits on a singed chair
he pours from a half pint bottle of vodka into his won ton soup container smoking a cigar
on the arm of the armchair is a brown legal folder and stacks of photographs of the crime scene and the burned bodies
its your crime scene now
you can do what you want
watch the news
nah i musta missed it
well just so you know
i gave you guys the credit
well just so you know i dont care about that stuff
nah why should you
i dont even watch tv
eddie knocks his won ton soup back
did you get a report from the m
but i would like to ask you something
you got a problem with me
if you found me steppin on your crime scene it might piss you off too
then what about the report
you were right they were both dead before the fire
the male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine
thats usually an indicator of something personal
jordy pulls out a sketch of daphne
hands it to eddie
the super said hed seen her before but she didnt live here
acts as if he didnt notice hmmmm
maybe you dont care about that either
beat prettiest suspect ive had in awhile
who says shes a suspect
jordy tries to take the sketch back
eddie holds on
what would you call her
look im not even sure she has anything to do with this
i saw her outside after the fire thought it was a lead
maybe she saw something
maybe she was visiting somebody here
eddie walks up to the burnt mattress where the bodies were
obviously they werent having sex
as you pointed out
so why go through all the trouble of putting em like that
eddie passes a crime scene photo of the bodies to jordy
maybe its a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message
burial rites are taken very seriously in eastern europe
it could be to humiliate them
just burning them up no proper funeral its like condemning them to hell
the slavs have been fighting the germans and the russians for a thousand years
these are very intense people and they take things personally
eddies cellular rings he grabs it
you sure it was a knife
to jordy weve got another murder in a hotel on eighth avenue
clerk said the room was rented by a russian
eddies moving with daphnes sketch
ill come with you
there wasnt a fire
therell be nothing for you to do
i can watch you eddie
maybe ill learn something
this isnt homicide school
my parents are from poland
i can help with the eastern european angle
my folks are
video pov of the news stand as a hand reaches into frame and picks up a copy of the new york post
eddies photo is on the front page holding the kitchen timer by the wires
underneath his picture the caption reads double homicide
flemmings on it
the videocamera widens out revealing emil standing in front of a times square news stand reading the front page
the videocamera turns around until focusing on oleg himself
this is second day in america
first day was very exciting
full of thrills and chills
over there is co star of my new movie emil
he turns the camera around filming emil
to vendor who is he
new yorks finest
this is his case
the vendor picks up people
stephen geller is on the cover
this all you want
do you know how much killer gets for movie rights
people in here says he wants a million
the killer gets one million dollars for a television interview
hey tabloids paid ted bundy famous serial killer half a million for his interview
and how much you think monica got for writing book about the president coming on to her
it pays to be a killer or a whore in this country
look you want magazine or not
oleg picks up film comment movieline and premiere magazine
emil pays for everything
to oleg get a taxi
oleg tucks the magazines in his coat picks up the suitcases and hails a taxi
as emil collects his change he sees an old blind woman waiting at the crosswalk
the lights blinking let me help
emil gently takes her arm and crosses her to the other side
thank you son
emil watches her walk on
the hotel room is a hive of activity
gil is dusting the dresser for prints
another officer is stripping the bed and putting the bedding into a big clear plastic bag
as eddie enters the crime scene a police photographer is standing in the doorway taking pictures
where is she
takin a bath
still unknown but were running prints
kid over there caught the case
leon steps in his way
eddie walks over to a young detective
tommy cullen only is excited to meet eddie
heard a lot about you
nice to meet you
heres what we got
a girl in there figure her to be a prostitute looks like she was fighting for her life
shes got defense wounds on her hands
right this way in the bathroom
eddie follows tommy into the bathroom
theres blood splattered all over the walls and the floor
honeys topless body lies in the tub tangled in the bloody shower curtain
murphy an irish medical examiner m
is examining the body
room was registered to a francis capra
thats not czech or russian
who said he sounded russian
check the switchboard see what phone calls were made from this room
ill do it
tommy heads out
eddie takes out his cigar holder
slides out whats left of his cigar
re lights it
looks down at honeys body in the bathtub
gils dusting the tub for prints
clothes were off in the other room
tub is dry except for the blood
any of you guys take a piss lately
gil looks confused
eddie points to the toilet
seat is up
do the seat for me
gil crosses to the toilet and starts to dust it
eddie stands in the bathroom studying the scene
holding the unlit cigar
looking around at the blood splattered walls
only one guys checked in
you wanna go to homicide school
here make yourself useful
eddie positions jordy behind the tub next to the wall
our killers standing here slashing at her
shes fightin him
the blood is splattering this way
its on this wall
pointing to the right of jordy and theres some specks over here
to the left of jordy theres nothing here because someone was standing right here
and hes got blood on him
lots of blood
he wouldnt walk out of here like that
turning to murphy murphy what kind of knife you think were talking about here
murphy pulls out a clear plastic ruler and walks over to the blood splattered wall
if you look here where he missed and hit the wall you see that the marks arent deep but theyre kinda wide
not your everyday kitchen or pocket knife
what if the tip was broken off
then we should find it here somewhere
i think weve already found it
eddie exchanges a look with jordy as tommy the young detective returns
there was only one call from this room last night
i dialed it
its an escort service
did you identify yourself
hey im new but im not stupid
call communications and get an address on that number
tommy holds up a slip of paper with the outcall service address on it
jordy hurries out catches up with eddie
you goin to the escort service
you got any better ideas
mind if i ride along with you
this has nothing to do with your fire
but what if it does
you might need my help
as eddie exits the hotel a man approaches
hey eddie can i get your autograph for my son
jordy catches up
eddie finishes signing the autograph using the mans back
ill let you know what happens
this is ridiculous
im not gonna be in your way we can talk the case over
tell you what ill flip you a coin
if you win you can come with me
if you dont win you dont come
ill call it
eddie pulls out a coin and hands it to jordy
ill call it
jordy flips the coin and its heads
see you lost twice
jordy goes for the passenger side of the car
before jordy can get in eddie starts to pull away
jordy stands on the sidewalk dejected
eddie stops the car again and this time lets jordy get in
eddie and jordy arrive in front of roses door
eddie knocks and flips a coin to jordy
jordy takes the quarter
not understanding what eddie means
he looks at the quarter
better than one
eddie suckered him with the coin toss
eddie laughs squirts binaca in his mouth
we hear whos there
wed like to ask you a few questions
i have nothin to say
if you wanna contact my attorney
commands homicide miss hearn
its detective eddie flemming
immediately unlocks unchains and opens the door
ive seen you on tv
eddie glances self consciously at jordy
just a minute
and i dont have a camera
hold on a second
rose moves back to the phone finishes up her conversation in afrikaner
we hold on eddie and jordy at the door
eddie looks around taking in the place
four girls are on phones
two girls take orders for customers
the other two work the phone sex lines
rose hangs up the phone turns to eddie and jordy whats wrong
we dont have her i

though rose answers jordy she directs her response to eddie
he wanted a girl from czechoslovakia but i sent him honey cause once they get there you know it doesnt really matter honey was killed

a butch girl enters
rose speaks to her in afrikaner
afrikaner boy shes so popular all the sudden

another guy came in asking me about her too
jordy pulls out the sketch unfolds it
i tried to recruit her gave her my card
she said shed think about it but i never heard from her
afrikaner beautiful eyes
who came by looking for her
he said he was her cousin
i told him where she works

second guy with him was
shorter with a wrestlers build
and he wouldnt turn his videocamera off me
he had a videocamera
where is she
she washes hair up at ludwigs a salon on rd and madison
as eddie speeds through the street siren blaring
jordy holds on as eddie darts in and out of cars with astonishing dexterity
this man can drive
eddie picks up his phone dials
jordy is on his cell phone as well
leon meet us at rd and madison
overlapping im on my way with eddie

eddie looks over as jordy disconnects
eddie picks up a beer he was holding between his legs finishes it

jordy looks at eddie cant deny hes right

the lens finds the receptionist
in the back
probably shampooing a customers hair
oleg approaches daphne who is mixing hair dye
ludwig the owner is with her

a customers waiting

she smiles at him turns on the water in the sink then sees oleg filming her
she backs up
suddenly moves to the emergency door
theres a garden out there
daphne runs toward the alley
oleg follows her still videotaping
as she rounds the corner she bumps into
he pulls out his kitchen knife shoving her against the wall pushing the blade with the broken tip against her throat
i have a temper
she looks at him not understanding
oleg films the scene
when i lose it i lose control
i didnt intend to kill milos but he stole from me
when i went to prison they beat me
i still didnt tell he was my partner
i loved milos like a brother
the tone in emils voice theres an uncharacteristic softness to it
he wants to reconcile his behavior to her
in english im not a killer
the back door opens
he shoves the knife in his pocket as ludwig peers around the alleyway
what he sees is emil leaning close to daphne kissing her
daphne will you be coming back to work
in a minute ludwig
im glad youre not a whore
but washing hair
this is no job for a woman as beautiful as you
they should be washing your hair
emil reaches into his pocket and pulls out something sticks it in the palm of her hand closing her fingers around it
i dont want to kill you
but if you talk i will
whispers i thought youd want these
he taps her hand
he turns and goes out the rear exit
she says nothing
im a fire marshal
you remember me from the other night
you are daphne right
she says nothing
you dont have to be afraid
were here to protect you
come with me
we want to talk to you

eddie looks at jordy
takes daphne by the arm
as they come out eddie notices daphne clutching something in her hand
he reaches for her hand
its a brushed gold necklace
did he give you these
was he just here
eddie searches the streets
notices oleg and emil on the far corner
oleg is videotaping him
leon and tommy pull up
they all pop out
eddie grabs leon squeezes his arm quietly
the other side of the street
the guy with the videocamera
back to jordy dont look put her in the car
to leon stay this side
back to tommy stay with her
they start heading down the curb trying not to attract the attention of oleg and emil
of the scene from across the corner
czech put the fuckin camera down
emil starts to flee
what follows next is an incredible foot chase with eddie jordy korfin and leon running through traffic chasing emil
eddie tries to stay in the lead but is running out of breath
jordy runs down one side of madison eddie the other
korfin continues down nd and leon covers the other side
they search for emil grabbing people turning them around missing him
emil seems to have disappeared
leon gun raised approaches the cafe
as he rounds the corner emil darts out cracking leon across the face
leon crashes into a table dropping his gun
emil scoops up the gun and pistol whips leon
beating the detective to a pulp
people are running from the scene
emil takes leons wallet
he is distracted by laughter
oleg is videotaping the scene
oleg swivels with the videocamera
korfin is running toward them pushing through the crowd
korfin is blown backwards
bends down to leon whose face is red with blood
jordy runs to korfin whos laying in the street shot in the side
jordy cradles his partner
are you hit
to korfin bobby bobby
wherere you hit
stay down bobby
jordy looks up as eddie steps into the center of the street
cars screech out of the way
eddie crouches taking aim at emil who is almost two blocks away
its an impossible shot out of range
but eddie closes an eye aims and squeezes off one shot
two blocks away emil topples
korfin and jordy look at eddie astonished he made the shot
emil scrambles to his feet
eddie holsters his weapon
pulls out a handkerchief
dabs leons wounds
he got my gun
motherfucker was filming the whole time
take it easy
dont worry well get those fuckers
eddie and jordy watch as korfin on a stretcher is loaded in an ems vehicle and in b
an ems doctor attends to leons bloody face
eddie and jordy turn to go back into the restaurant now cleared out as nicolette karas arrives with her cameraman
detective can you tell us what happened here
i cant talk right now
we have some things to take care of
jordy moves off he doesnt want to get pulled in front of nicolette
daphne can be seen waiting in the back of the restaurant maybe twenty feet away
tommy stands next to her
this is where eddie and jordy are headed
i understand but i noticed that the fire marshall is here with you
is this somehow related to the fire department
i really cant give out any information right now at this point

eddie walks into the restaurant
throws a look back at her then enters
jordy talks to daphne
i told your partner i cant help

she says nothing
whether you tell us or not well find out

if i tell you will you arrest me

they probably threatened her
is that all there is
she looks at eddie
are you here illegally
dont worry about that
well talk to immigration
they wont deport you
no no dont talk to immigration
she clams up
something back home
jordy leads daphne to a table she sits
eddie sits across from her
jordy crouches down next to her
my little sister and i shared a flat i came home one night and a man was raping her
his gun was on the chair
he came at me and i shot him
thats a justifiable homicide
yes but he was a cop

the police is right a civilian is wrong
so i fled
look we can help you but right now we have to deal with whats happening here

is that the truth
youre a cop youll never believe me
to eddie can i talk to you
eddie steps away with jordy
keeping his eyes on daphne
she tries to listen
even if that story is true
eddie tilts his head
look let me talk to her
any leads i get theyre all yours
just let me have a first crack at her
you wanna talk to her alone
what would your girlfriend think of that
i dont have a girlfriend
my point exactly
im serious here
so am i
you intimidate her cause youre a celebrity
she sees me differently
youre her savior
is she the kid youre gonna save from the burning building
you know what im saying here
eddie looks at his watch
thinks it over
okay tell you what ill give you a head start
you take her to the station house
dont let her out of your sight
shes the only warm body we got left
im a professional
women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs
he gives jordy a look and heads for the door
emil pulls off his sock and shoe lifts his foot into a stained sink and washes the blood away exposing the chunk of pink flesh taken out of his ankle
emil grabs some toilet paper plugs the wound then cuts the towel off the dispenser with his kitchen knife and wraps his ankle
he grits teeth in pain
the lights go out
then oleg adjusts the fluorescent light above the sink
gotta light the scene better
now its more moody
like a scene from the shut up
does it hurt
emil lifts his foot out of the sink
this is nothing
emil lifts his shirt exposing his back
i hate looking at that
dont want to film this
we dont see what oleg sees not yet but from his expression its horrible
daphne rides in the backseat
jordys watching her in the rearview
now i become custody of police department
if you cooperate with the da maybe theyll help you with your situation
i will if they dont send me back
they wont until this is over
she looks away
out the window
jordy sees emotion filling her eyes
she looks back at him her eyes have teared up
are you married
do you live alone
beat ive been in these clothes since
could we stop at your place
i could take a shower
before i go into custody
jordy looks at her
cant quite tell if shes trying to manipulate him or really just wants to get cleaned up before all the shit starts
i cant take you to my place
jordy looks at her
staring right at us
i want to talk to you about something serious
he holds up the diamond engagement ring
i want to live the rest of my life with you
i dont know youve been married before and ive never been married but i do love you and
eddie is standing in front of a mirror rehearsing the proposal
he notices a small dab of blood on his shirtcuff
paulie enters carrying a towel and a vodka tonic
paulie sets down the drink and begins their silent ritual
he hands eddie the towel
eddie wipes off his face and hands then hands the towel back to paulie
paulie helps eddie on with his coat
eddie takes some visine out of his coat pocket
drops a few in each eye
he straightens himself and looks in the mirror taking a big gulp of the drink
eddie sets the glass down and starts out
paulie hands him a binaca
eddie gives himself a squirt as he exits
eddie takes a seat at a table
he takes the ring out of his pocket holds it under the table
nicolette karas walks up to eddie from behind
gives him a kiss on the cheek
she orders a drink in greek from the greek waiter then sits down across the table
theres a long pause they just look at each other

she walks out
jordy unlocks the door
enters with daphne
the fire station is empty
the men are out of quarters practicing putting out fires
the station is empty
he gestures toward the stairs
jordy and daphne walk through the locker room
her eyes never leaving jordys
you considered becoming a prostitute
yes i considered it
did you ever turn tricks before
what about back home
looks at him
stands very close
i came here
i had no money
i knew no one
i couldnt get a job because you have to have a green card to get work
they approached me i couldve made a lot of money
i considered it but
its not who i am
they pay me below the table at ludwigs
so you were never a prostitute
what are you asking me
im just trying to find out who you are
she looks up into his eyes
thinking hes hinting
can you let me go
she leans in close to him giving him the opportunity to kiss her
jordy is tempted but
remembers eddies warning and backs up slightly
showers are this way
desperate now willing to do anything daphne moves in even closer
you could shower with me
jordy is locked in her eyes
almost giving in
then breaks away
gestures towards the showers
daphne looks away form him crestfallen
she heads to the showers
jordy follows her into the bathroom
the walls are lined with shower stalls
ill uh ill get you a towel
he leaves her there
she quickly moves to the window
its a two story drop to the street
gets a towel from the locker room
his beeper goes off
he checks the number but decides not to return the call
we follow him back into the bathroom
the shower is on but he notices the window
he rushes over
he looks out
no sign of her
he turns looks back at the shower
its on but he cant see through the curtain
cant tell if shes there
he walks over quickly fearing that shes left
he pulls the curtain aside
shes crouched in the corner shower stall
she looks up at him her eyes filled with tears
are you alright
jordy sits on the bench next to the shower
im not a whore
im not a whore
you dont know
i was desperate
thats not me
i shot a cop
can you imagine what theyll do to me when i got to prison
theyre not gonna send you right back
i didnt mean to
actually im glad its over
all this time
never being able to look anyone in the eyes
always afraid that someone would find out who i was
never trusting anyone
he covers her with the towel pulling her up
you can trust me
she embraces him
he stands there for a moment
then awkwardly holds her
on a steak
male hands cut a piece
another male hand sets down a huge bottle of extra strength excedrin
the hands abandon the steak and rip open the bottle
the camera pulls back to include the lcd screen of olegs videocamera
he is taping emil as he rips open the safety plastic with his teeth
emil is sweating with fever and his eyes are glazed over in pain
he drinks pills from the bottle and chews them up
wincing in pain
emil washes them down with a beer
emil looks down and the camera follows his gaze to the people magazine article hes reading on stephen geller
shaking his head at the article as the videocamera tilts back up to his face
what is it
the video of milos and tamina i told you to erase it
and the whores murder
you didnt erase that either did you
dont lie i wont be angry
put the camera down oleg
oleg closes the lcd screen and puts the camera down
emil removes a small address book from leons wallet he looks up eddie flemmings name
what is that
what does it look like
its an address book
oleg jumps up with the camera to tape the book
let me get a shot of it
hold it this way
oleg gets a shot and quickly sits back down
why wont you be angry at me for keeping my movie
emil takes a gulp of beer drops cash on the table and limps away
its quiet chief duffy paces in front of the sergeants desk
looking at his watch
growing more and more aggravated as every second ticks by
jordy enters escorting daphne
sees duffy and tires to go past him
duffy turns and sees jordy and daphne
jordy stops and comes back
sitting daphne down on a bench
hey chief what are you doing here

will do chief
eddie leads the way walking past the sergeants desk toward the back and to his office
eddie holds up his hand silencing jordy
a handful of detectives talk about work over burned coffee
eddie enters with jordy
give me a few minutes
they empty out
look eddie im tellin you i didnt touch her
well you shoulda because nobodys gonna believe you didnt
i took her there for a shower and thats it
just a shower
eddie gives jordy a questioning look
yeah just her in the shower
look im sure you probably think im a fool and i fucked up but
no i dont think you were a fool i just think you were stupid about it
i mean to say the least you outta know better
you dont know her well enough
shes got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her its fuckin over
you can deny it all you want but it will not make one fucking bit of difference
i told you you know i thought i was doing the right thing you know i think shes innocent
well its not up to you to decide whether shes innocent or not
dont you understand thats why youre a professional
but i mean didnt you ever go out on a limb for somebody
i mean you shoulda heard her there
tellin her whole story
i believed her
how you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an immigration lawyer
here heres a number of an immigration lawyer
thats how you help her
but you cant get involved in her like that
youre gonna jeopardize your career your life and youre gonna jeopardize my case
and lemme give you another piece of advice
maybe you dont watch tv but ill let you in on a little secret the whole fuckin world watches television
and when you get out there they know your face
and the little fame the little fuckin itty bitty fame that i get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job
and i get more done because of it
jordy studies eddie for a quiet beat
whyd you help me back there with the chief
whyd you stand up for me like that
you know i dont know
i like you
you remind me of a puppy i used to have
he pissed on the rug all the time but i still kept him
eddie picks up his cigar thats going out
he sticks it in his mouth
a match is lit
he looks up
jordy holds the match
eddie dips the end of the cigar and puffs
the homicide detective and the fire marshal hold a look
eddie walks in carrying flowers
he closes and locks the door behind him
he grabs the phone
anything turn up
did they check the hospitals
yeah i hit him
i fuckin hit him
we should be all over everywhere with dogs choppers everything
these guys are from fuckin czechoslovakia
he looks at the flowers
decides to put the case behind him for a moment
ill call you later
he hangs up
arranges the flowers in a vase
so they look perfect
sets them on the coffee table
fills out a card writes nicky i love you
will you marry me
he sticks the card in the flowers turns the lights down low
puts a romantic sinatra song on the stereo
moves to the liquor cabinet
pours himself a drink
he sets the ringbox on the coffee table next to the flowers
theres a knock at the door
eddie smooths his hair unlocks the door
but the hallway is empty
eddie steps out in the hallway with the drink in his hand
walks toward the elevator
doesnt notice the shadow that passes behind him entering his apartment
no sign of anyone
he walks back toward his apartment
turns and locks the door
a blur jumps out of the shadows slamming him on the head with a gun
eddie tumbles to the floor
as its focused on eddie handcuffed and upper body taped to a chair minutes later sobered up
emil is sitting in front of him
on the coffee table alongside him are the flowers in a vase
theyve ransacked the place
emil has eddies watch his gold shield and his money
hes smoking one of eddies cigars and in emils hand
is the diamond engagement ring and card
oleg minutes style is positioned behind emil videotaping eddie
he moves to the corner of the room bringing a light back over to illuminate eddies face
what do you want
leaning forward you see they going to make a movie about me too eddie
and write books
sarcastic whats your accomplishment
i kill someone famous
then do it asshole
good be tough to the end
actor who plays you will want to die like hero
eddie looks at the videocamera
emil answers eddies look
so tabloids dont have to do re enactments
they going to have real movie this time
if you kill me and film it youre putting a noose around your neck
emil turns to oleg
turn it off
emil turns to eddie
we are insane
who else but crazy men would film their murders
gestures to eddie so we kill someone famous and if we are caught we are sent to mental hospital
but what good is money there
because once in hospital i say i not crazy
just pretended to be acquitted
we see psychiatrists
they must certify we are sane and because of your what is law called
eddie says nothing oh i got it
because of your double jeopardy law we cant be tried for same crime twice
we come out free rich and famous
you really think youll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit
how fuckin stupid are you
smarter than americans
youre fed cry baby talk shows all day long
not only will americans believe me theyll cry for me
detective eddie flemming would you like to say goodbye to your nicolette
maybe you can propose to her now
eddie says nothing
just stares at emil
emil puffs on eddies cigar
he has nothing to say
signaling oleg start the camera
emil looks at oleg
this is my project
i say action
i am the director
you are the talent
you wait for me to say action
emil looks at eddie as if to say see what i have to put up with
oleg gestures from behind the videocamera
oleg films as emil raises eddies service revolver
eddie suddenly kicks at emils hand but emil pulls it away backing out of eddies reach
bad last moment i cut that out
emil raises the pistol again pointing the gun at eddies left temple
emil cocks the hammer but eddie avoids the gun ducking his head to the side of emils arm
standing and following his head up emils arm and pushing him over into the desk
eddie then knocks emil with the chair and emil falls off the desk and onto the floor
oleg still grips the videocamera
eddie continues around with the chair and drives oleg back across the room pinning him to the wall
eddie comes back from oleg to the gun at the same time as emil is limping for it
eddie knocks emil out of the way with the chair and then stabs him with the legs of the chair repeatedly
eddie comes up and around again at oleg who is coming at him from the wall
eddie knocks oleg over the coffee table and onto the sofa
falling on top of him rolling over and leaving oleg on the sofa
eddie manages to get up from the sofa and position the chair in such a way that he can fall over backward and grab the gun
emil limps toward the gun at the same time and it is not clear in the darkness who has the gun
oleg gets up from the sofa and goes over to get the videocamera
eddie has managed to get the gun and comes up as oleg is moving in with the camera and starts shooting toward oleg managing to shoot one of the blinds
off the window and one of the lampshades off the lamp
oleg crouches down with the camera and eddie starts to turn toward emil who comes at him with the knife and stabs him in the stomach
emil steps back revealing the knife is buried in eddies eddie stumbles backward falling over but still attached to the chair holding the gun
eddie cant believe he got stabbed
blood swells around his stomach
he cant be dying
this cant be happening
he looks at emil
the pain is terrible
oleg has knelt down next to eddie getting a close up
emil looks at eddie
emil looks around
grabs a black pillow and finishes eddie off suffocating him
we are moving through a tunnel pitch black so dark all you feel is the motion
we are travelling very fast
finally in the distance a speck of light which fills the frame
we slowly pull back from the white light to discover it is a tiny pixel on a tv screen
further out we see eddies funeral on the evening news
its an enormous gathering a sea of blue uniforms and dignitaries
in the upper right hand corner superimposed over the funeral is a picture of eddie from his id and in his nypd uniform
we see olegs reflection on the set with the videocamera
he is filming the tv
we hear the audio from eddies funeral
detective flemming was one of the most decorated nypd detectives in the history of new york
he made several thousand arrests during his career including the famed stephen geller case
beloved by the community in which he served
his partner eulogized him
leon is at the mic
eddie was my mentor my best friend and my partner
he taught me the meaning of the word cop
he was a man in every sense of the word
ill miss him
choking on tears sleep well brother
leon begins to sing amazing grace
oleg pans from the tv and focuses it on a lightbulb
hands enter the frame carefully pouring clear liquid into an ashtray
a long hypodermic needle slides into the ashtray the plunger is pulled back and the needle quickly fills with liquid
gingerly the needle is inserted into the lightbulb
again the plunger moves and the lightbulb is filled and placed on a table
next to a can of gasoline
videocamera zooms out revealing
emil sitting at a hotel desk doing this
its packed with cops drinking
many who were at the funeral including leon
all wear the black ribbon on their badges
theres a quality of an irish wake boisterous guys cursing
many cops in uniform
a buffet has been laid out
hawkins enters in a black suit wearing a black ribbon
he greets people shaking hands embracing leon
what an awful day
he was new york city
hawkins notices a young man by the window
hawkins nods to him
i never got to tell him how much i admired him
i know son i know
we all loved him
hawkins moves on
he notices at the end of the bar sitting alone on a stool is nicolette
he moves to her
pulls up a stool alongside her
she turns looks at him
just stares at him for a long beat
she is bombed
shes had many
she turns to hawkins
you know he was gonna propose to me
the crime guys found a card hed written out to me
and a ring box
these fuckers that killed him have my ring
they have my diamond engagement ring
hawkins touches her shoulder with compassion
what do you mean you know
he told you he was gonna propose to me
overriding i want to hear everything he said
im trying to tell you
he was talking to me and leon about marriage
oh my g d
we were having lunch here
he started making overtures talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but i got a call to anchor and i walked out on him
i walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him
nicolette is crying now
she angrily wipes away a tear
id never had a great relationship before
id never made great choices with men
and he wasnt easy to get to know
he was older my parents told me i was nuts to get involved with him
but he was so great to me
always encouraging telling me i could do anything
beat he was the one
you know id give up everything everything for just a little more time
i wouldve spent fifteen minutes with him if thats all i knew i had
shes lost it
hawkins consoles her
nicolette shrugs him off turns back to her drink
downs the rest of it
a woman arrives maggie hawkins producer assistant in tow
what are you doing here
holding a cellular youve got a call
i cant talk to anybody right now cant you see im busy
i cant talk business
have a drink
to paulie get her a whiskey
trust me youll want to take this call
robert steps off the stool
takes the phone
who is this
listens how do i know this is you
hawkins gives nicolette a comforting squeeze on her shoulder
backs away from the bar
now out of hearing distance he looks back at nicolette and lowers his voice
we intercut emil on a public phone in the lobby of a movie theater
oleg videotapes emil on the phone as he throws glances into the theater
come to broadway
dont bring the police
come alone or youll be in my next film
low look asshole

the line goes dead
hands the phone back to maggie
shes looking at him
hawkins looks at nicolette
his mind whirls
daphne and korfin are sitting at a table
korfins arm is in a sling his side bandaged
duffy and jordy enter in their dress uniforms
korfin walks over to them

jordy looks at her
duffy sees them hold each others look
chief mind if i take her
but not water sports
duffy walks out
jordy leads daphne out of the station
a man in a cheap suit is talking to camello who points as jordy walks by
the man chases after jordy
excuse me jordan warsaw
shoving papers in jordys hand consider yourself served
jordy opens the papers
korfin puts daphne in the car
walks back over to jordy and reads over his shoulder

who is zwangendaba
and gets more depressed
its an old brownstone in poor condition
jordy pulls up
opens the door for daphne takes her by the elbow steering her to the door
he is edgy

i still cant believe eddies gone
he looks at her
they walk up to the stairs as the front door opens
a neighbor exits shocked
jordy pulls daphne out of the way
in czech to the man hello

jordy and daphne make their way up the stairs
a bouquet of flowers are outside daphnes apartment
she takes the card
jordy looks over her shoulder
daphne reads good luck with all your troubles
im here if you need me
is he your boyfriend
hes gay are you jealous
if i was your boyfriend i might be
if you were my boyfriend id suggest you find another girlfriend that isnt going to jail ten thousand miles away
theyre staring in each others eyes
the sexual tension strong
a good immigration lawyer could stall the process
eddie recommended one
no matter what happens
im glad i met you
im glad i met you
they hold each others eyes
then suddenly they kiss
somebody is coming up the stairs
they part quickly
a tenant enters his apartment down the hall
jordy clears his throat
lets get your stuff
he opens the door
peers inside checking it out
turns to her
gestures that its okay to enter
its very small
almost no furniture
the bare minimum
the apartment is a hole
she looks at jordy
both thinking the same thought
you better get packed
she holds his look
do you have coffee
in the kitchen
ill make some for us
ill get my clothes
she heads down the hall
jordy enters the small kitchen
he flips on the kitchen light and the lightbulb explodes the room
jordy jumps back
jordys more surprised than shaken
its a fire he knows the drill
he pushes her into the living room
then notices a fire extinguisher hanging on the wall
aims it at the fire spreading in the kitchen
he sprays as daphne thats not mine
the fire extinguisher feeds the fire
flames leap up from the fire shooting toward the extinguisher because its filled with gasoline
the handle locks
jordy cant turn it off
flames engulf the extinguisher and he flings the extinguisher backs out of the kitchen
closes the door
jordy takes off his jacket
stuffs it under the bottom of the door
blocking the smoke
he hurries into the living room
knowing its moments before the extinguisher will explode
jordy pulls out his cellular
hits the speed dial as he notices daphne about to throw a chair through the window
itll suck the flames toward us
she smashes the window
theres an explosion in the kitchen
smoke and fire rush down the hallway and along the ceiling
jordy yells into the phone this is jordan warsaw
we got a make it quick were trapped
th avenue and th street
he pulls daphne toward the bedroom
jordy kicks it open
grabs the comforter off the bed
shoves that under the door jam
he pulls daphne into the bathroom
shuts the door
runs his severely burned hand under the cold water
daphne looks out the window hearing the sirens
she notices someone has nailed the window shut
and on top of one nail
is eddies gold shield
oh my g d
oh my g d
jordy turns sees eddies shield
they were here
this freaks her out
they were in her home
she starts to panic
get a hold of yourself
he pulls aside the curtain to the bathtub
in it is a can of gasoline
a virtual bomb
daphne reaches for the can of gasoline
what are you doing
pouring it out
she grabs the can of gasoline pours it down the drain
the fire is raging outside the bathroom
the bathroom door is beginning to smoke and burn
they are trapped
jordy turns grabs an exposed water pipe that runs up the wall to the ceiling
he throws his feet against the wall for leverage
pulls with all his might to break it loose
its creaking but hes having a hard time with it
jordy looks over
the gasoline shes pouring out is not going down the drain
its stopped up
as soon as the fire gets in the bathroom everything will explode
jordy begins pulling at the rusty pipe with all his might
daphne comes over helps him
both of them trying to break it off
suddenly it snaps and water pours into the room
soaking the walls
they point the pipe toward the door soaking some of the flames which are consuming the door
trying to stop the fire from coming in
he and daphne are drenched
jordy grabs a broken piece of pipe
starts smashing the wall behind them
the wall to the adjacent apartment
jordy and daphne in the bathroom surrounded by fire
camera whip pans down the street as fire engines arrive
is videotaping them from the opposite rooftop
tenants from daphnes building are fleeing down the fire escape
emil stands in back of oleg who is very excited
he turns the camera on himself
this is great film
you can see fire right now daphne is in fire fire marshal is here
everything is so messy
everything is so crazy right here
look at this fire
we made it
of people who die in fire die from eating smoke
so most likely they all die from eating smoke
the camera pans to emil
and this is the man who started the fire
say something to your fans emil
emil waits a beat and then blows a kiss to the lens
filled with smoke
you can barely see jordy or daphne
jordy smashes a hole in the wall which reveals the bathroom in the apartment next door
the smoke has a place to escape
theres a year old kid in there
standing in the bathroom
get out of the bathroom
the hallway is on fire
im a fireman
im going to help you
jordy pushes daphne through the wall turns as the bathroom door catches fire
its seconds before the whole room will blow up
across the roof is videotaping the bathroom as it explodes
fire engines have arrived
the street is filled with gawkers
garcia and korfin pull up just as jordy runs from the building holding the kid in one arm and pulling daphne with the other
carefully guarding his bandaged hand
a fireman grabs the kid
another grabs daphne
garcia and korfin run to jordy
what the hell happened

he spots daphne on the corner as a familiar voice pushes through the crowd
isnt she a beauty
shes my fire look at that loom up on her
jordy turns its max

korfin scans the crowd
looking for emil and oleg

jordy and korfin turn
the chief has a phone to his ear and is freaked
as he enters the tv station
his clothes burnt and still wet
the lobbys full of angry cops
tommy and leon still in his funeral suit screaming above them all at maggie the producer and her assistant who are standing behind the desk
where is he
where is hawkins
hes not on the premises

any request for the video must be directed to top storys attorney bruce cutler

leon jumps over the desk where maggie stands
tommy pushes past the security guard to follow leon
they continue toward maggie pushing her further back into the office
she tries to protect herself with an office door which leon slams open
lady if you put eddies murder on tv ill get a warrant for your arrest and shove it so far up your ass itll come outta your mouth
i want your shield number
viewer discretion advised
pointing at the tv you want the tape
there it is
leon tommy all the cops and jordy turn toward a tv set which is mounted in the lobby
the top story logo flashes on the screen then robert hawkins is seen behind his desk
what we are about to broadcast is very graphic footage
everyone is riveted
but jordy notices outside
a top story news van is waiting in the alley
robert hawkins jumps from a doorway and into the van
jordy backs out
a video pov of a bottle of crystal as the cork is popped
the videocamera pans up to emil sitting at the table
he nods at the waiter who leaves
emil raises the glass looking into the lens
who says you cant be success in america
i arrived with nothing knowing nobody now look i am a success story
the videocamera is lowered
oleg turns it off
you are success story
i am success story
why do you say i and not we
oleg dont be paranoid
you got a hundred fifty thousand dollars didnt you
i gave you half of what they gave me
look here we are
emil gestures toward the big television set
we are in planet hollywood where diners and those by the bar can watch a huge screen hanging from the ceiling
robert hawkins is introducing his show
welcome to top story
tonight i present to you material of a graphic and violent nature never before seen on television
and i do so with a heavy heart
you will be first hand witness to the slaying of celebrated new york city homicide detective eddie flemming
it would be only normal to ask why
why are we showing something so journalist i must show it
a democracy survives through the freedom of its media and if we cannot see what is happening then we dont deserve our democracy or our freedom
eddie flemming was my friend
i cried when i watched this footage and vowed to fight this violence with every molecule of my being from this day onward
hopefully this will have a similar effect on you
one final word this material is absolutely not appropriate for children
the restaurant buzzes
emil checks his watch
in movie they make of us who do you think would act me
the one who got caught in the bathroom
beat george michael
emil points towards the tv
top story is continuing
the scene cuts to emils video footage
eddie is handcuffed to the chair
the light illuminating his face
this is my project
i say action
i am the director
you are the talent
you wait for me to say action
beat and action
bad last moment i cut it out
emil looks at oleg furious
i told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape
oleg watches the big screen tv as emil raises the pistol to eddies temple
eddie pushes him over the desk
eddie then knocks emil with the chair and emil falls off the desk onto the floor
eddie continues around with the chair and drives oleg back across the room pinning him to the wall
eddie and emil both go for the gun
eddie knocks him out of the way
stabs him with the legs of the chair repeatedly
leaves him in a ball on the floor
oleg comes at eddie and he knocks oleg over the coffee table and onto the sofa
the blinds and lamp shade are shot bathing the room with more light
emil stabs eddie in the stomach
oleg kneels down for a close up
hawkins van drives across times square
jordys car following
we widen out
eddies murder is being broadcast on the jumbotron in times square
people stare up stunned
the dinner patrons are watching tv
emil glares at oleg
why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director
because i am the director
dont you realize if it wasnt for my film for my talent my idea to do this no way would we be sitting here right now
i thought it was my idea
arent you just the cameraman
oleg doesnt laugh
this this is a great american film
full of violence and sex
and i want my credit
before we hand in the next video i put titles on it and my credit is going to read directed by oleg razgul
but theres only one problem you want credit but the problem is i dont share credit
oleg is pissed
you got that
no i dont get that
you think you are a director
you are a fucking little small russian piece of shit
and i hate you
i fucking hate you
emil slaps oleg across the face
oleg stands up
emil suddenly pulls out eddies gun but before he can pull the trigger oleg stabs emil in the arm
emil squeezes off a shot through the crowded restaurant
patrons scream oleg runs through the restaurant escaping
hawkins arrives with a crew and with bruce cutler a confident tough criminal attorney
emil pulls the steak knife out of his arm picks up a napkin pressing it to his wound
cutler accesses the situation
are you my attorney
extends his hand to cutler im emil
im not your lawyer until i see the money
i have your money
emil picks up a briefcase and hands it to cutler
cutler opens it inside is the cash emil got from robert hawkins
emil looks at the table pushing the plates and silverware aside
emil looks under the table throwing the chair aside freaking
hes lost the most important thing in his life
follows emil reaching out to him emil
take it easy

what do you need
what are you looking for
he has the camera
he took the movie
jordy comes in gun raised
get your hands up
emil puts his hands in the air
immediately drops the gun
i give up
jordy is disappointed
he didnt want to take emil alive
hawkins signals to his camera man who swings his camera at jordy as he approaches emil his gun aimed at emils head
this man is unarmed officer
jordy cracks emil across the face knocking him down
what are you hitting him for
turn that camera off
jordy handcuffs him
emil turns to the camera for sympathy appearing more hurt than he is
jordy realizes how media savvy emil is and understands in that moment why hes surrendering
jordy yanks emil up dragging him across the restaurant floor emil still favoring his ankle
to emil dont say anything
where are we going

to jordy im invoking rights this man is represented by counsel

cutler hurries to emils side

to leon hes represented by counsel

tommy shoves cutler aside

jordy pushes emil in the back seat and slams the door
leon turns to hawkins whose cameras are filming everything
and you youll pay for what you did
low this footage will work in your favor
when the jury sees this no matter what cutler tries theyll convict him
leon looks at him
this man used to be his friend

dont give me that fucking shit
the cameras are rolling
dont get into it on tv
yells to other cop cars alright lets get going
leon and the other cops rush to their cars
jordy is already behind the wheel
as soon as tommy jumps in the passenger seat jordy takes off
the cameras film him driving away
jordy takes a left turn racing away
running all the lights
what are you doin
youre gonna lose everybody
jordy rips through another turn heading toward the west side highway
the car speeds up the ramp and races up the left lane having lost the police
where are you goin
this aint the way to the station
jordy looks up at emil in the rear view mirror
jordy pulls off on th street
they are way uptown in the middle of nowhere
the car drives down a dark street
crumbled vacant buildings dominate the streets and there are no people around
the car slows down
tommy watches jordy realizes whats going on
jordy stops at a dead end
pulls open the back door yanks emil out and starts to drag him up into the deserted tunnel
listen to me
you cant do this
this isnt the way to do things
jordy ignores tommy slamming him up against the tunnel wall
were you a fireman
that how you knew how to rig the apartment
my father was
he gave me many lessons about fire
now its my friend
tommy take a walk
what are you gonna do
dont you get it
he knew he was gonna get caught
thats why he videotaped eddies murder he thinks hes gonna get off
dont stoop to his level
jordy tosses the car keys to tommy
take the car
get outta here tommy
look you cant shoot him in cold blood
erupting tommy nervously backs up toward jordys car
climbs behind the wheel and drives away leaving jordy and emil alone in the darkness
jordy takes out eddies pistol
the one emil took from eddie
jordy opens the cylinder two bullets left
jordy snaps the cylinder shut tucks eddies gun in emils belt
he drags emil away from the wall into the center of the empty space unlocks emils handcuffs and throws them aside
still holding the gun on emil he circles around to face him
get your hands up
get your hands up
now facing emil he sticks his gun in his waistband the same place he put emils
you wanna be a real american
go for your gun
emil holds his arms out making it clear hes not going for the gun
pull the gun
you want to be famous
shoot me youll get more headlines and make more money
emil watches jordy
a slow grin spreads across his face
you cant kill me
youre not a cop
just fireman with a gun
i bet you never shot anybody in your life
youll be my first
jordy pulls out his mm and pushes the barrel right between emils eyes
pull the trigger
oh look youre sweating
you dont have the balls

emil gets on his knees and starts to sing in czech
sirens fill the air
police cars come flying down the street
wheres your partner

leon runs up
tommys relieved to see jordy didnt kill emil
gimme your gun jordy
we all want him dead but you cant do it this way
emil is still smiling
jordy suddenly slams emil in the face
knocking him to the floor
he jumps in his car and speeds away
a room service waiter wheels a tray with a magnum bottle of crystal with three glasses toward olegs room
jordy follows behind him gun aimed at his back
do you really need me
keep your mouth shut
dont mess this up
they reach the room
jordy flattens himself against the wall
the waiter knocks
nervous r room service
a hooker wrapped in a towel opens the door a crack looking out at the waiter
jordy whips around the corner pointing his gun and pushing the hooker back out of the room
jordy moves to the bedroom door
peers through the crack
oleg sits on the edge of the bed in his skivvies with two naked prostitutes
hes hooked up his videocamera to the tv set and is showing them his footage of the fire

jordy kicks in the door gun raised
oleg grabs the videocamera
has on hooker in a head lock and picks up the other one
he rushes at jordy using one of the hookers for protection
drop the girl
oleg pushes the hookers at jordy knocking jordy back into the living room and over the back of the sofa
oleg rushes out into the oleg runs to the fire exit jordy follows chasing oleg down the stairwell
oleg bursts out a door which opens onto broadway
he runs through the crowd knocking pedestrians aside
jordy chases him gun in hand
oleg runs into the street darting in and out of traffic cars braking to a stop
one slams into another
jordy leaps over a car closing in on oleg
even in new york its odd to see a man being chased in his underwear
oleg runs knocking people aside
hes holding the camera in his hand
a uniformed cop turns as oleg runs right into him
knocking him down
oleg beats him takes his gun and runs into oleg gun in hand runs past the ticket taker at the door
hey come back here
the ticket taker runs after oleg who continues past the candy counter
jordy rushes in the door
where is he
whered he go
jordy continues running through the lobby past the middle door and enters the theater through the far door
jordy enters the theater crouches down in the aisle
its a night scene the theater is dark
jordy tries to see faces
he cuts through a row of seats to the middle aisle
kill the bastard
jordy spins toward the voice its a drunk
others start yelling for blood
jordy realizes the shots are coming from the screen
oleg stands up and fires at him trying to film jordys death with a videocamera
jordy ducks then rises up with his gun as oleg vaults over the seats leaping from one to the other mashing shoulders and heads bounding for the screen
jordy fires as the screen villain blasts away
some in the audience dont realize the real thing is happening
oleg leaps on the stage in front of the screen illuminated by it
jordy runs down the aisle
oleg fires at jordy
jordy fires back
people panic scurrying away jordy cant get a clear shot
oleg fires again wounding a moviegoer
jordy raises up as the theater lights go on
and oleg is gone
jordy jumps on the stage runs backstage oleg has disappeared
sirens are heard from outside
voices of cops are heard as they enter
a reporter is in times square reports from outside the movie theater
and the wild chase through times square ended with the suspect oleg razgul escaping
the fire department has identified the fire marshal involved in the failed pursuit as jordy warsaw
the channel is changed
peter arnett is reporting the same story
in a related matter mr
slovaks attorney bruce cutler famous for handling sensational cases claims his client is unfit to stand trial
daphne sitting on a bench in a jail cell
watching tv through the bars
she is in the fire departments holding cell in brooklyn
in fact cutler claimed mr
slovak was not the alleged mastermind behind the murders
according to cutler mr
slovak was being directed by his partner who threatened to kill him if he didnt follow mr
cutler told reporters today that mr
razgul did in fact stab his client
the scene cuts to cutlers press conference
my client mr
slovak is a victim
whats happened is not his fault
emil was under the influence of his partner
at the trial youll see that my client will be vindicated
the camera widens from the tv set
we are now in an interview room a guard is posted outside the room
emil sits at a small table with cutler
emil is dressed in bellevue clothes
hes handcuffed and his ankle is bandaged
emil gives a complimentary nod toward cutler
i brought you some letters
its really fan mail
one wants to buy you clothes another sent a check
another wants a check
you bring the cigarettes
cutler shakes a cigarette out of the pack stuffs it in emils mouth and lights it for him
emil has never smoked before
howre they treating you alright emil is nonresponsive i want to get the cuffs off
but theres a little bit of a problem
things out there are very negative right now for us
we gotta change that around
perception is very very important
perception is reality
i know youre not fuckin crazy
but its important that i get that message out
cause thats our only defense in this case
emil leans forward
cutler retrieves the cigarette from between his lips
i want you to focus on three things fear
he puts the cigarette back in emils mouth
delusions and paranoia
i was all of these
well you didnt appreciate the severity of it until recently
no question about that
what about oleg
theyre looking everywhere
maybe he went back to czechoslovakia
no he is here
dont worry about him
think about yourself
what about my movie rights
look i havent really focused on that kind of thing
whats your cut
i would say
half is fair
or i call another lawyer
this is the biggest case of your life
dont try to negotiate
say yes or no
this is not about money emil
i need your trust in me
what else do you need
i need to know about your background
i need to know about your upbringing
why youre here
indicating cigarette give me another one please
cutler stuffs another cigarette in emils mouth
tell me about yourself
what you did as a young boy
what your parents were like
my father always degraded me
killed my self esteem
and my mother was blind
your mother was blind
yeah she went blind giving birth to me
she went to fucking black market doctor to induce me
back in the czech republic
bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind
and my father blamed me for her blindness
your father blamed you for your mothers blindness
yeah he hated me from day when i was born
put it out
can you put the cigarette out
cutler takes the cigarette from emils lips and extinguishes it
thats what he did to me
he put cigarettes out on me
your father put cigarettes out on you
out on my back when i was a small boy
can i see your back
cutler comes around and pulls his shirt up
his cigarette burns
cutler recoils horrified
dont you think
i dont think its abuse i think its torture
inside the arson squad duffy sits behind his desk
jordy stands across the table from his chief
behind jordy we can see garcia and korfin outside listening
duffy has a subpoena in his hand
the public doesnt have any idea what we do and now youre going to define our image
this is going to be our rodney king
what was i supposed to do
the guy tried to mug me
i was gonna send a cop back i just forgot
you handcuffed a civilian to a tree
chief i know i screwed up but this guy was no innocent civilian
well this is gonna end your career and probably mine
end my career
how are you going to fight this
maybe if oleg hadnt gotten away and youd been on the front page as a hero this thing would be easier to fight
youd have the good to weight against the bad
its unfortunate that i have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but theres nothing i can do
gimme your shield
theres nothing to talk about
get a good lawyer
youre suspended until your trial
he surrenders his shield
drops his handcuffs his pager and his gun
duffy picks up the gun looks at it
pats jordys shoulder i know you got backup at home
drop it off
jordy sighs and exits
jordy is talking to bill stern a senior special agent
in another office we see daphne with two year old assistant to jordy look what dont you understand
weve got a good relationship with the czechs and the state department doesnt want to cause an incident
but the d
needs her as an eyewitness
theyve got her testimony on videotape
and even if they do take her to court immediately after shell be extradited
the czechs want her back
she shot a cop
i mean christ man what if emil slovak and oleg razgul fled to the czech republic
how would you feel if the czechs wouldnt give them back to us
stern looks over at daphne sitting in another office
lowers his voice
and just between us
i was married to a redhead
theyre a jinx
redheads are like cross eyed priests
stay away from both
jordy gives him a look
you want to see her go ahead
jordy enters the other office
sits next to daphne
the assistant u
were gonna fight the extradition
daphne takes jordys bandaged hand in hers
forget about me
you have enough problems of your own
do you really want me to forget about you
i dont want to drag you down with me
daphne touches her finger to his lips
she leans in and kisses him
then looks into his eyes trying to find a smile
its weeks later
nicolette is looking worn tired frazzled
shes trying to go through her stand up
but shes unraveling
not recovered from the loss of eddie
and today with his partner who he blamed for the crimes still at large emil slovak will appear in court
his lawyer will argue that he is mentally unfit to stand trial
eyewitness news has also learned that later this month jordy warsaw will himself be appearing in court
he will be arraigned on charges of violating the civil rights of
goddamn assholes everywhere
i got it

lets start again
she starts over
jordys on the couch
a drink in his hand watching tv with his dog zack
jordys eyes are glazed
hes drunk his eyes are as bloodshot as eddies were
without his job or daphne
his mind miles away the dog and drink are his only comfort
as nicolette reports she got the name right her anger seeps through her broadcast
zwangendaba claims to be a direct descendent of the african king from whom he takes his name
jordys face is flashed on screen
the phone rings
jordy picks up
listens no comment
he hangs up
the phone rings again
jordy hangs up
changes the channel
he stops as robert hawkins face fills the screen
he is standing across from someone in a park interviewing him
he robbed you
the angle cuts to zwangendaba the mugger now dressed in a suit and tie
clean shaven and with a fresh haircut
he stands in the same spot where jordy handcuffed him to the tree
hes appearing on top story
thats right i encountered him right here
i was just askin for change an he whips out his big gun an pushes me up against that tree whereupon he takes my money and handcuffs me to it
leavin me there all exposed
the phone rings again
jordy suddenly pulls the phone off the table and throws it through the window as the channel is changed
a reporter is on tv
behind him is a picture of emil
emil is smiling in a shirt and tie
the reporter stands in front of the jail
and wbai has learned that mr
slovak wont have to worry about how he is going to pay for his defense
he has received movie offers and been in conversations with numerous publishers concerning the rights to his life story
oleg is at a bar watching tv
poisoned with envy
jordy stands in front of the mirror over the dresser
we see the tv overturned in the b
his back up gun is on it
he stares at it
dark thoughts dancing in his head
jordy sits in a taxi wearing sunglasses
looking inside the park where a police barricade surrounds a police tugboat
cutler and emil are arriving emil is being transferred to rykers island
jordy pulls his
out of his ankle holster and sticks it in his pocket
the taxi driver looks in the rearview mirror
i cant believe this guy got off
jordy takes out money
all hes got is fifty bucks and he crams it into the slot
whatevers leftover keep
jordy exits the cab
the anger rising inside his body is coming to a boiling point
he walks into the park
leon is sitting on a bench
just sitting there
also filled with rage and frustration
jordy meets his eyes
leon gets up and walks away
disgusted by it all
jordys right hand grips the gun inside his pocket as he walks on
many policemen are trying to control a swarm of reporters
all are waiting for emil
we see and his camera crew and not far from him frustrated and frazzled waits nicolette
still grieving her loss she looks over at hawkins and his crew
she shoots him a disgusted look hawkins shrugs it off
he checks his watch anxious looks at his cameraman
he said hed be here
pick him up as he comes through the crowd
do you hear me
for chrissakes dont miss this
cutlers car behind it
emil handcuffed is unloaded from the van
reporters swarm forward cutler gets out of his car hurrying up taking his place alongside emil and the police escorts
the swarm follows firing questions at cutler
he answers the barrage of questions with my client was suffering from a major illness of schizophrenic nature wherein during times of intense stress as a result of paranoid and
psychotic delusions there was impairment of his ability to appreciate wrongfullness
this is a victory for the mentally ill
jordy walks alongside the moving mass
his eyes focused on emil his hand in his pocket
we notice in the crowd max the celebrity crazed pyromaniac
whats he doing here
maxs hand is also stuck deeply in his pocket
a weird gleam in his eye
we see korfin in the group speaking to other cops
nicolette and her camera crew are vying for their place in the mass
she watches emil with quiet rage
cutler continues before emil boards the police boat and heads for rykers island where he will be checked into the psyche ward i want to say one last word to
as you know emil was coerced by oleg razgul into committing these murders yet oleg is still out in the street a free man filming gruesome murders
my client and i hope he is brought to justice in the near future
they are through the monuments approaching the steps when jordy passes a distracted hawkins whos checking his watch obsessively
where the hell is he
jordy glares at emil
emil looks back at jordy gloating
he beat the system
jordy suddenly erupts
you think this is funny
what the hell are you laughing at
emil stares down jordy
jordy grips the gun inside the jacket
to a nearby escort officer keep this man back hes assaulted my client on previous occasions
a patrolman blocks jordy from emil
this is it
this bastard kills the best cop this city ever had and we do nothing
you may not like it marshal but thats the law
and what about the other victims
what about their families
hell end up in some country club nuthouse while his lawyer sells his rights to the movies and we just stand here and do nothing
we let this scumbag walk
jordy moves past the officer
emil breaks away from cutler
gets in jordys face
i can kill you
jordy shoves emil into cutler
a scuffle breaks out as the cops separate the two pulling jordy back as we cut to as it approaches hawkins from behind
a hand dips into frame tapping hawkins on the shoulder
hawkins turns sees who hes been waiting for
his face lights up
i thought you wouldnt show up
where is it
where is the tape
in disguise sunglasses and a hat
holding his videocamera
its all in here
all in here
has been separated from cutler and emil as hawkins voice cuts above the din of the crowd announcing excitedly wait a minute bruce
weve got some interesting evidence something you should look at
reporters turn as hawkins speaks
his crew is taping as he continues introducing his broadcast i have exclusive rights to the original uncut videotape shot by oleg razgul proving emil slovak was not insane
hard to believe
reporters swing their cameras over as oleg holds his videocamera up in the air
he knew exactly what he was doing all of this was planned
its all here in my movie
emil is not insane
oleg plays his videocamera as lenses focus we see excerpts of the moment where emil explains to eddie so we kill someone famous and if we are caught we are
sent to mental hospital
points to oleg officers theres your killer do your duty arrest him
the police are attempting to get to oleg but a sea of reporters separate them
we hear the staccato calls from the press corps
nicolette looks on in amazed outrage
jordy notices and starts moving towards her
before the police captain in charge of the detail can react the rage which killed milos tamina and honey wells up inside emil
he yells at oleg
you are the traitor
you are murderer
i am director
oleg pulls his gun
emil pulls cutler in front of him as oleg fires
cutler is shot and goes down
hawkins swings his camera over to oleg filming the would be assassin
oleg fires off another shot hitting the court officer escorting emil
emil grabs the down officers gun
he swivels rapid fires at oleg
people are screaming
emil darts forward grabbing nicolette who is closes to him
he puts his handcuffed arms over her head points the gun at her head

the captain is screaming at all his men

emil is screaming back at the captain as jordy screams at emil

meanwhile the captain is still yelling no on shoot
no one shoot
no officer will follow
no officer will shoot
nicolette is still encouraging jordy
everyone is screaming at once
its mass chaos
the captain is trying to keep everyone calm
cops following along with their weapons lowered
all except jordy his gun still pointed at emil
hawkins cant believe what footage hes getting
hes pushing his cameraman to the front of the pack
trying to get the best coverage
ill surrender if he lowers his gun
hes pointing at jordy but hes continuing to back away towards the police boat
dont let him surrender
jordy wont take his gun off him
let her go
let her go
the captain is yelling at jordy
lower your weapon
i told you lower your weapon
jordy struggles to get a clean shot at emil
his heart pounding
he suddenly lowers his weapon
the captain visibly relaxes
jordy suddenly turns back
quickly raises his weapon
emil takes a shot in the leg
nicolette ducks under the handcuffs and scurries away
emil looks at jordy surprised he shot him
jordy fires again
emil is hit in the shoulder
jordy marches forward emptying his clip in emils chest
gun fire echoes in the humid air as emil stumbles back
does a funny dance and drops to the ground
the captain yells
i told you not to shoot
no officers should shoot
jordy quietly answers im not a cop
im a fire marshal
hes still alive
hawkins looks down at oleg
he is sprawled on the ground
his videocamera in hand hes still making the movie
as it zooms from the statue of liberty and pans to oleg
he looks in the lens with his dying eyes gasps a film
by oleg razgul
and oleg dies but suddenly his eyes pop wide open
hawkins jumps back oleg smiles coughing in pain
how was that
olegs head rolls to one side
nicolette runs over to jordy
glad emil is dead
jordy starts to walk away
wait a minute
where are you going
learn from eddie
talk to the court of public opinion
take the credit you need it
she turns him around
straightens his tie
starts to push the hair out of his face but he stops her hand
jordy puts something in her hand
she looks down
its eddies badge
the one jordy took out of daphnes bathroom
she looks up at him
her cameraman rolling
the lens pointed at jordy
jordy looks at nicolette
meets her eyes
he doesnt want to make a statement
he still doesnt want the fame
he did learn from eddie
eddie was killed because he was a celebrity
jordy wants no part of it
her cameraman lowers his leans
jordy turns and walks away
get a shot of him leaving
then pan to me
jordy disappears into the sea of people
the camera pans back to nicolette
well he wouldnt talk to us but you saw it
the camera pulls back from nicolettes face and the video is now on we pull back further and further
nicolette finishing her stand up new york city has a new hero fire marshal jordan warsaw
