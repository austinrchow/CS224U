by terence malick final version dialogue and continuity the time is
holly sargis the year old heroine sits on her bed petting her dog
the camera dollies back as she talks on holly v
my mother died of pneumonia when i was just a kid
my father had kept their wedding cake in the freezer for ten whole years
after the funeral he gave it to the yardman
he tried to act cheerful but he could never be consoled by the little stranger he found in his house
then one day hoping to begin a new life away from the scene of all his memories he moved us from texas to ft
dupree south dakota
hold on full shot of bedroom
the streets and alleys of ft
dupree at dawn
on sound we hear the clucking of doves
a garbage truck appears
details of the mechanisms at the back of the truck
kit carruthers the hero a year old garbageman kneels beside a dead dog
he inspects it briefly
then looks back at his friend and co worker cato a stocky man in his forties
ill give you a dollar to eat this collie
cato inspects the dog
im not going to eat him for a dollar
i dont think hes a collie either
some kind of dog
they drive off
watch your heads
the truck comes to a stop
kit bangs on the drivers door
gimme a cigarette
woody waves him off
kit shrugs to cato
woody wouldnt give me a cigarette
pause ever notice he dont talk much
cato agrees with this
they make a terrible racket with no regard for the sleep of the neighbors
holly whispering some rhyme to herself twirls a baton in the middle of an empty street
little did i realize that what began in the alleys and back ways of this quiet town would end in the badlands of montana
kit tries to sell a passing bum a pair of shoes
they wouldnt fit
how do you know
you hadnt tried them on yet
gimme a dollar for them
cost twenty new
the bum walks off
kit pitches the shoes to cato
why dont you see if they fit you
cato picks them up and looks at them
kit is culling through a trash can looking for valuables
reading other peoples mail etc
this lady dont ever pay her bills
shes gonna get in trouble if she doesnt watch out
cato ignoring him picks up a magazine that is lying in the grass
when the camera returns to kit he has stripped off his apron
i throwed enough trash for today cato
ill see you in the morning
he slaps cato on the back and walks off
cato throws a mouldy loaf of bread at his back
what do you mean
he throws the loaf back at cato
kit walks through the deserted alleys of the sleeping town
as the main titles appear
he balances a stolen mop on his finger he stomps a can and looks around to see if anyone has spotted him at this
as the credits end he sees holly in front of her house twirling her baton
he crosses the street and introduces himself
hi im kit
im not keeping you from anything important am i
well i was just messing around over there thought id come over and say hello to you
smiling ill try anything once
pause whats your name
i said mine
you want to take a walk with me
i got some stuff to say
guess im kind of lucky that way
most people dont have anything on their minds do they
holly eyes him suspiciously
they walk down the middle of the street
holly has accepted his offer
oh incidentally my last name is carruthers
sounds a little too much like druthers doesnt it
well nobody asked me what i thought
they just hung it on me
holly breaks the silence that follows
you still in school
nah i got me a job
well i dont mind getting up early so i got a job throwing garbage
im not in love with the stuff okay
in the distance we hear hollys father calling her
she eases off
thats my father
i got to run
wait a minute
when am i going to see you again
holly isnt sure how to reply
well i know what my daddys going to say
can i be honest
well that i shouldnt be seen with anybody that collects garbage
hell say that
now whats he know about garbage huh
there you go
well i mean theres nothing he wants to know about it
ive got to run
she waves goodbye and runs off
kit waves back
holly walks into the back yard where her father is working
half painted signs lean against the garage
who was that
just some boy
he throws some paint off his brush onto the ground
is that going to kill the grass
he flicks his brush teasingly at her feet
she retreats to a chair giggling
you got some on my feet
whatd he want
just wanted to know if we needed any yardwork done
i said no and for him not to bother us
kit is talking with a clerk inside an employment agency
you ever held another job before
i used to throw trash for the city
you lost that one
wouldnt be here if i hadnt
what kind of work do you think you would be qualified for
i cant think of anything at the moment
id like you to write me out a slip though proving i came down here
the clerk leafs through his papers
well i think we could find you something
working cattle over at the pens
what the hell
just hope theres a breeze
the clerk gives him a slip of paper
holly sees kit approaching the house
he was handsomer than anybody id ever met
he looked just like james dean
she walks out the front door
well stop the world
quit my job
just seemed like the right move
how do you say quit my job in spanish
something mi trabajo
kit offers her a cigarette which she declines
yeah well im going to work as a cowboy now
or thinking about it
its a routine like anything
what do you think
i dont know
he pulls himself up onto the bannister beside her
well at least nobody could get on me about wearing these boots any more
she watches him intently
this makes him uncomfortable
you want to go for a ride
well i got homework
bring it along
his forwardness surprises her
they are walking through the downtown area
kit kicks a paper bag that someone has discarded on the sidewalk
somebody dropped a bag on the sidewalk
she appears nervous about being seen alone with him
everybody did that the whole townd be a mess
he greets a passing stranger
youre a redhead
anybody ever call you red
yeah but i dont like it
ive got a headache
he steers her toward his car a customized mercury
as she gets in he asks her kit o
can i come around and see you tomorrow
holly startled okay
we see kit at work at the feedlot
throwing hay to the cattle feeding them pills etc
kit went to work in the feedlot while i carried on with my studies
little by little we fell in love
as id never been popular in school and didnt have a lot of personality i was surprised that he took such a liking to me especially when he couldve had
any other girl in town if hed given it half a try
the montage includes a shot of holly running toward kits car for some rendezvous
he said that i was grand though that he wasnt interested in me for sex and that coming from him this was a compliment
held never met a fifteen year old girl who behaved more like a grownup and wasnt giggly
he didnt care what anybody else thought
i looked good to him and whatever i did was okay and if i didnt have a lot to say well that was okay too
kit and holly are sitting under a tree
playing cards on a blanket
holly surveys the area
what a nice place
kit absorbed in game yeah the tree makes it nice
and the flowers
lets not pick them
theyre so nice
its your play
hollys father paints a picture
using a stereopticon to help with his backgrounds
track with kit driving down a street in his mercury
holly sits watching football practice
of course i had to keep all this a secret from my dad
he wouldve had a fit since kit was ten years older than me and came from the wrong side of the tracks so called
our time with each other was limited and each lived for the precious hours when he or she could be with the other away from all the cares of the
kit and holly are necking underneath some bleachers
in the distance we hear the noise of the football practice
my stomachs growling
theres an old fudgesicle over there
you want it
kit laughs and starts her laughing too
somebody else is going to get it
i dont care
kids eat that kind of stuff in korea
at this her expression turns serious
kit in closeup at a fence in the feedlot an intense look on his face
various angles of the cattle in their pens
they look numb and morose
tight shot of holly necking with kit
in the stench and slime of the feedlot hed remember how i looked the night before how i ran my hand through his hair and traced the outline of his
lips with my fingertip
he wanted to die with me and i dreamed of being lost forever in his arms
tight shot of hollys pet catfish in a bowl
cut to wide shot of holly with gloves on carrying the fish through the garden in back of her house
she looks around warily then throws it out among the melons
the whole time the only thing i did wrong was throwing out my fish when he got sick
later i got a new one but this incident kept on bothering me and i turned to kit
kit and holly walk down a sidewalk in the residential part of town
kit is consoling her about the fish
i didnt mind telling kit about stuff like this cause strange things happened in his life too and some of the stuff he did was strange
kit steps on top of a dead cow as though to convince himself that it is dead
he faked his signature whenever he used it to keep other people from forging important papers with his name
the camera dollies back to reveal kit lying in bed
his attitude suggests that this is a scene of her fantasy
and as he lay in bed in the middle of the night he always heard a noise like somebody was holding a seashell against his ear
and sometimes hed see me coming toward him in beautiful white robes and id put my cold hand on his forehead
kit puts on his jacket and heads down a riverbank to the edge of the water
holly comes into view buttoning her blouse
did it go the way it uz supposed to
is that all there is to it
her questions make him uncomfortable
gosh what was everybody talking about
dont ask me
im glad its over
for a while i was afraid i might die before it happened
had a wreck some deal like that
kit points to an uprooted tree lying in the water a hundred feet away
you see where that tree fell in the water
he climbs back up the bank
the river mustve washed the roots away
you dont care about anything i say though
holly walks down the bank of the river
kit falls in behind her carrying a large stone
the camera dollies with them
you know what i think
that we should crunch our hands with this stone
that way wed never forget what happened today
but it would hurt
well thats the point stupid
she gives him a cold look
dont call me stupid
okay but im going to keep it for a souvenir
he throws it awav and picks up a smaller one
or maybe one thats lighter
he walks over to the car
a bridge is visible in the distance
kit releases a large red balloon into the evening sky
a small basket is fixed to the bottom of the balloon
kit made a solemn vow that he would always stand beside me and let nothing come between us
he wrote this out in writing put the paper in a box with some of our little tokens and things then sent it off in a balloon hed found while
on the garbage route
pause his heart was filled with longing as he watched it drift off
something mustve told him that wed never live these days of happiness again that they were gone forever
hollys dog bounds through a stand of cattails
holly speaks angrily to her father who walks toward the dog with a gun
we do not hear their voices only music
he shoots the dog and holly runs off in horror
then sure enough dad found out id been running around behind his back
he was madder than id ever seen him
as punishment for deceiving him he went and shot my dog
hollys father drags a duffel bag out of his truck and dumps it over the side of a bridge into a river
it goes under briefly then bobs to the surface
the current takes it off
holly sits in the second story window of a music school
he made me take extra music lessons every day after school and wait there till he came to pick me up
he said that if the piano didnt keep me off the streets
maybe the clarinet would
kit approaches hollys father who is hard at work painting a billboard along a deserted stretch of road
kit is eating a peach
sure is pretty
whatd you come out here for
i wasnt aware there was any law against it
kit sees that this kind of talk will not do
he is silent for a moment then throws the peach away
you know holly
she means a lot to me sir
hollys father goes solemnly about his business
you know before i met her nobody could ask me how i was doing with my girl
matter of fact i didnt really have one
is that right
kit walks off a few paces and leans against the fathers truck
it okay me leaning on your willys here
hollys father does not answer
i got a lot of respect for her sir
pause thats about as good a one as i know to tell you
well its not good enough
pause just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you kit
guy like you
shed get along okay
and if she didnt well she could take off just take off and i wouldnt mind
id always tell people i deserved it
hollys father comes to his feet and fixes kit in the eye
you get out of here
i dont want you hanging around any more
he lets these words sink in then returns to his seat
shaking his head youre something
kit waves goodbye
takes all kinds sir
he walks to his car looking back once
long shot of father at work at billboard
kit approaches hollys house collects the evening newspaper from the sidewalk and knocks on the front door
hollys father picks her up from a park outside the music school
kit when he gets no answer enters the house
the jeep with holly and her father rumbles down a residential street
kit is going through hollys dresser throwing her things into a suitcase
a pistol is visible in his back pocket
suddenly hollys father appears in the dresser mirror standing at the end of the hall outside the bedroom
kit walks forward to greet him
the camera dollies with him
whatre you doing
ive got a gun here sir
its always a good idea to have one around
kit draws the pistol
he is shaken though he must have seen this coming
what do you think youre doing
go on get out of here
well i got it all planned
and im taking holly off with me
he looks at holly who has appeared on the landing uncertain what her reaction to all this will be
okay boy im turning you over to the authorities
kit steps forward as hollys father starts down the stairs
for coming onto my property
with a gun
no youre not either
cause i cant allow it
hollys father stares at him for a moment then continues down the stairs
kit starts forward
hey wait a minute
his shout arrests hollys father at the bottom of the stairs
suppose i shot you
howd that be
hollys father does not move
you want to hear what it sounds like
he fires a shot into the stairs
the report is deafening in the enclosure of the stairwell
they exchange looks
kits breathing is heavy
hollys father turns and walks into the living room
kit rushes down the stairs
holly shouts his name
hey where you going
he fires two shots into hollys father who slowly sinks to the floor
kit unlimbers his shoulder
holly rushes down the stairs to her fathers side
this is holly
are you going to be okay
her father does not respond
she looks back at kit who avoids her gaze
she gets to her feet and walks nto the kitchen
kit follows her
kit closes the back door to the house
i came in the front
how bad off is he
i can look and see
we better call the doctor
ill say how it happened part i saw
kit sighs well
i dont think thatd work
this startles holly
kit touches the fathers heart
he dont need a doctor
he walks back into the kitchen
are you sure
you dont believe me see for yourself
holly stares at her father
low angle of hollys house silhouetted against the evening sky
on sound the noise of cicadas
kit drags hollys father into the cellar
sets him down gently then eases out of the room taking a discarded toaster with him
kit comes up the steps from the cellar
holly stands at the drainboard
i found a toaster
he sets down the toaster and walks over to hollys side
i dont want to
she slaps him across the forehead
he walks into the now darkened living room and sits down at the piano
after a moment holly follows him
holly sits down on the sofa across from kit
listen maybe we ought to tell somebody about this
you said that once already
too late now
theyre not going to listen to me
are you kidding
a silence follows
suppose the neighbors heard the noise
wouldnt be funny
listen ill be back in a while
he gets up and heads for the front door
you want to call the police thats fine
just wont be so hot for me
there are tears in hollys eyes now
they exchange looks as kit opens the front door
then he leaves
holly settles back on the couch
the house by night
holly comes up the stairs smoking a cigarette
she walks to her bedroom window
the camera dollies with her
outside under the street lamp she can see two boys trading secrets
kit puts fifty cents into a gramophone booth
he clears his voice as the machine whirs into operation
my girl holly and i have decided to kill ourselves same way i did her dad
big decision huh
well the reasons are obvious and i dont have time to go into them right now
one thing though
he was provoking me when i popped him
thats what it was like a pop
inserts of the booths mechanism a light panel measuring off the seconds and the needle on the record
course nobodys coming out of this thing happy especially not us
you cant deny weve had fun though
which is more than i can say for some
thats the end of the message
i run out of things to say
he gets these last words in just as his time is up
he gets the record and steps outside the booth into the lobby of a train station
kit slams a ten gallon can of gasoline down on the piano bench opens it and begins pouring it out over the interior of the house kicking aside everything that
comes in his way
holly comes out the screen door at the back of the house carrying a suitcase and a painting
kit appears with a lamp on an extension cord
he sets it down beside a victrola he has set up on a table outdoors
he puts the needle on the record he recorded earlier
holly watches him as she retreats to the car
kit left a record playing over and over for the district attorney to find
he was gambling for time
kit unplugs the lamp lights a book of matches and pitches them into a puddle of gas
the back porch of the house explodes into flame
kit runs to the car with the lamp caught off guard by the force of the flames
they drive off
various objects around the house burst into flames a picture we saw on the stairs
some peacock feathers a cantaloupe and a pomegranate left on the kitchen table the living room hollys bedroom the bed itself a doll on the bed an a w root
beer sign outside the house a water can flames swirling out the front of the house
hollys father in closeup in the cellar sheet music lifting off the piano
at length the camera pans over the charred frame of hollys bed
outside a fireman moves with a flashlight through the embers of the house
holly collects her books from a locker at her school and walks anxiously down a corridor towards the exit
kit made me get my books from school so i wouldnt fall behind
wed be starting a new life he said
and wed have to change our names
his would be james
mine would be priscilla
wed hide out like spies somewhere in the north where people didnt ask a lot of questions
holly breaks into a run as she comes through the front door of the high school
kit waits for her at the car
there is nobody else in sight
i could of snuck out the back or hid in the boiler room i suppose but i sensed that my destiny now lay with kit for better or for worse
and that it was better to spend a week with one who loved me for what i was than years of loneliness
she gets into the car and they drive off
kit studies holly for signs of her mood
how you doing
holly neutrally im fine
kind of tired
yeah me too
the car sails down a quiet street
the camera dollies with a tree floating down a swollen river
cottonwood trees cover the far bank
we hid out in the wilderness down by a river in a grove of cottonwoods
it being the flood season we built our house in the trees with tamarisk walls and willows laid side by side to make a floor
there wasnt a plant in the forest that didnt come in handy
details of the cottonwoods willow and tamarisk
music continues under
details of kit and holly building the treehouse
kit pounds a log into place wi h a tomahawk holly scrapes the bark off a log with a piece of flint kit weaves tamarisk branches through the frame of
this montage ends with a pan down the four stories of the completed treehouse
we planned a huge network of tunnels under the forest floor and our first order of business every morning was to decide on a new password for the day
ow and then weld sneak out at night and steal a chicken or a bunch of corn or some melons from a melon patch
though we just lay on our backs and stared at the clouds and sometimes it was like being in a big marble hall
the way we talked in low voices and heard the tiniest sound
the camera pans off hollys painting a maxwell parrish onto kit asleep with his pistol beside him
then onto holly under a quilt with a box of shells beside her
her hand quivers once
kit lifts an egg out of a birds nest at the top of a tree
he drops it down to holly fifty feet below
they hadnt found but one set of bones in the ashes of the house
so we knew theyd be looking for us
kit made sure wed be prepared
kit cuts a piece of twine that lies across a trail whereupon a ball full of spikes comes swinging down out of the trees
with lethal force
kit ducks out of the way
we next see kit with a dew ag around his forehead running laps through the woods as part of his training
he exhorts himself to greater effort
he gave me lectures on how a gun works how to take it apart and put it back together again
in case had to carry on without him
he said that if the devil came at me i could shoot him with a gun
holly struggles through the undergrowth witha yoke over her shoulders carrying wood back to the teahouse
one day i carried thirty pounds of wood a distance of five miles
another day while hiding in the forest i covered my eyes with makeup to see how theyd come out
holly has made her eyes up with mascara
kit and holly dance the stroll to the sound of mickey and sylvia on their zenith portable
holly shows a better sense of rhythm than kit
kit lifts a fish out of the river with a crude device like a lacrosse net
holly sits on the bank in the b
the fish wriggles out of the net and falls back in the water
kit struggles in vain to retrieve it
we had our bad moments like any couple
kit accused me of only being along for the ride while at times i wished hed fall in the river and drown so i could watch
kit throws his net down in disgust partly at holly
take a break
life of riley huh
holly ignores him as he walks off down the flat
we got along fine and stayed in love
holly in curlers walks over to where kit is shaving
one of the chickens died last night
she pats a little water on her face dries it with a burlap towel picks up a hatchet and walks off into the forest to cut the mornings firewood
i almost stepped on him
holly sits on the upper deck of the treehouse reading kon tiki aloud to kit
the kon tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions
we had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs
i thought at once of suction from the coast which was drawing near and was continually out on the deck and up the mast
he was nervous
holly looks at him for a moment trying to understand the meaning of this interruption then resumes time passed
at dawn just before six torstein came hurrying down from the masthead
he could see a whole line of small palm clad islands far ahead
holly walks down the edge of the river fresh from her bath
wrapped in a white sheet
the river is raging with white caps visible in places
a strange animal not a deer or a horse but like them moves languidly through the thick of the forest
holly puts down her binoculars amazed
i grew to love the forest
the cooing of the doves and the hum of dragonflies in the air made it always seem lonesome and like everybodys dead and gone
kit sits in the crows nest at the top of the treehouse browsing through a copy of national geographic
amused by what he sees looking around to find somebody he can share it with
when the leaves rustled overhead it was like the spirits were whispering about all the little things that bothered em
an array of stereo slides is spread out on the leaves of the forest floor
holly puts one in her stereopticon and studies it
kit greets her as he walks by with a log over his shoulder
one day while taking a look at some vistas in dads stereopticon it hit me that i was just this little girl born in texas whose father was a sign
painter and who had only just so many years to live
with each of her thoughts a slide appears a canal in brazil a camel boy in front of the great pyramid
some cows standing in a fjord with a steamship in the distance a mother with her child a woman playing the piano as another woman looks on a family on
a lawn a soldier in a wheatfield whispering something into his girlfriends ear
it sent a chill down my spine and i thought where would i be this very moment if kit had never met me
or killed anybody
this very moment
if my mom had never met my dad
if shed of never died
and whats the man ill marry going to look like
whats he doing right this minute
is he thinking about me now by some coincidence even though he doesnt know me
does it show on his face
kit is fishing with his crude net
he stops briefly to watch a truck passing down the highway in the distance then goes back to work
this stretch of river seems dangerously close to civilization
for days afterward i lived in dread
at times i wished i could fall asleep and be taken off to some magical land but this never happened
kit frustrated draws his pistol from his back pocket and looks around for the fish that has been eluding him
he does not see as we do a man watching him from across the river
he fires at the fish
misses it and fires again
the man across the river hesitates
then moves back into the undergrowth
holly is off somewhere in the forest
putting on lipstick
kit sits on watch in the crowls nest a pair of binoculars close at hand
on sound over the music we hear voices whispering to them
kit sees a movement in the brush
a moment later a figure appears a hunter carrying a gun
kit shouts a code word to holly
she takes off running as kit clambers down the planks of the treehouse and collects his shotgun
he tells her to hide runs through the woods and dives in a hole under a cover of leaves
she jumps behind a log
several shots of the still forest follow then the hunters appear a shoulder here
pant leg there
the music ends as one of them cocks his gun
they pass right over the hole where kit is hiding
kit rises up slowly gives them a gentlemanly word of warning then shoots all three in the back
he checks to see if anybody else is with them then calls weakly out to holly
holly picks her way through the brush back to the treehouse
they are packed up and ready to leave
kit slams the trunk of the mercury
get in the car red
he takes a bird cage off the roof of the car and throws it away
we dont need this
he climbs a ladder looks in the cabin of the treehouse to see if theyve left anything behind then jumps down
he flips over the wicker hemisphere that covers their rooster
the rooster walks off free
he surveys the woods then looks back at holly who returns his look and gets in the car
kit felt bad about shooting those men in the backs
but he said theyd come in like that
and they wouldve played it as down and dirty as they could and besides held overheard them whispering about how they were only interested in the reward money
with lawmen it wouldtve been different
they were out there to get a job done and they deserved a fair chance
but not a bounty hunter
we see a flat expanse of the badlands
the mercury appears over the horizon and heads toward a solitary house
a man appears at the door of the house kits friend cato
we went to hide out with a friend of kits from the days of the garbage route
kit gets out of the car takes a chicken from the back seat and walks over to face cato
he keeps a safe distance
how you doing cato
kit steps forward rifle in hand and offers cato the chicken
take that sombitch
cato takes it a wan smile on his face
what you been doing
running this place for a fella in town
nothing much to speak of
well i dont notice us hustling trash either
kit walks over to inspect the interior of catos house
whered you get them antlers
they come with the house
he refers to a set of deer antlers mounted over the door
kit looks inside then back at cato
oh cato i want you to meet my girl holly sargis
holly smiles and says hello
they sit at a picnic table under a tree having lunch
holly is telling a joke at kits urging
did you hear the one about the guy in the nuthouse that went around naked with only a hat and gloves on and this nurse came up to him and
said hey what
you cant walk around that way and the guy says whats the matter
nobody comes around here
anyway the nurse says what do you have the hat and gloves on for then
and the guy says well you never know
cato bursts into laughter
isnt that funny
cato stops laughing
he wants to give kit the right answer
yeah i guess
she plays the clarinet too
holly smiles politely
dont you ever get bored around here
the other day though an old boy was plowing in the field over there found some old spanish coins
suspicious thats what he told you huh
no he showed me one
whatd they look like
kind of round like so
ill show you if you want
kit and holly eye one another
kit sees the chance to make a fortune here
he is careful to conceal his feelings though
let me finish my supper
holly big eyed bites into an apple
kit holly and cato walk out to the field where cato heard the coins were found
holly picks up a pot lid
were thinking of going down to texas
holly wants to visit some of her people down there but after that i dont know
they say mexicos nice
maybe id better get a shovel
ill catch up with you
kit walks out into the field to join holly
cato turns back
i found a lid
it was laying on the ground over there
put that down
holly tosses the lid at him
he picks up some dirt clods and starts throwing them at her
she squeals and dodges
cato watches them for a while indecisive then turns and runs
hey youre throwing big ones
suddenly kit spots cato
cato jumps over a trough and comes to a stop in front of his truck a water tanker
the shovels in the truck
kit raises his gun and shoots cato through the belly
cato falls then gets to his feet and stumbles toward the front door of the house
kit follows him for a while then skips forward and opens the door for him
cato falls on his bed and rolls over to face kit
kit walks in calmly and picks up a photo on the bureau
kit never let on why hed shot cato
he said that just talking about it could bring us bad luck and that right now we needed all the luck we could get
kit sets the photo down
you never told me about her
he looks under the bed then walks out the door
holly stands near a window
smoking a cigarette
kit sets his rifle down and surveys the room which is cluttered with odds and ends
look at all this junk
hows he doing
shrugging i got him in the stomach
holly sits down
is he upset
he didnt say anything to me about it
he takes a drag off her cigarette and gives it back to her
he leafs idly through a catalogue on the table then walks over to look in the bedroom
bunch of junk
inside the bedroom cato is still conscious but his breathing is heavy
kit walks back to hollys side
holly is looking through the catalogue
he stole that cage
i saw him doing it
kit wants this to have been an execution not a murder
whatcha looking in there for
we cant afford any of that
holly defensive just looking
as they bicker in the other room cato inspects his face in a mirror
why dont you go in there and keep him company for a while
holly walks in the door
she sits down
that your spider in there
in that bottle
what do you feed him
grasshoppers when i can catch em
does he bite
he never bit me
we hear the sound of a car horn in the distance
holly turns and looks
a studebaker approaches the house
there are two people inside a boy and a girl
kit comes out the front door
the boy and girl get out but seeing kit they wait by the car
well hes gone
he said not to tell
yeah he said for you to give us a lift into town
youre the ones with the studebaker arent you
the boy hesitates a second then starts for the house
well i just need to pick up something in the house
kit draws his gun
you go in there ill have to kill you
whats going on
cant afford to take chances
the girl is baffled
come on out of there young lady
kit waves them out into the neighboring field with him
lets us step out in this field here
the boy raises his hands
nah skip that
im going to have to keep an eye on you though
you dont mind
holly steps out the front door and smiles at the girl
holly and the girl walk through the field toward a storm cellar where the boys are waiting for them
the wind is blowing hard
whats going to happen to jack and me
you have to ask kit
he says frog i jump
whats your friends name
you love him
i dont know
holly thinks about this for a moment
ive got to stick by kit
he feels trapped
i can imagine
well ive felt that way hadnt you
kit guides the couple into the storm cellar
okay you two down in the cellar
they head down the steps into the cellar the girl first
kit stops the boy for a moment
you promise to stay down there for an hour
you expect me to believe that
he looks back at holly as though to ask whether he should
kit nods and waves the boy down into the cellar
the boy disappears
kit shuts the door
im going to shut the door
kit sticks a pin through the latch hesitates then fires two shots down through a seam into the cellar
he retreats to hollys side
a little surprised at what he did
think i got em
i dont know
well im not going down there and look
he starts running away from the cellar
holly follows him
a storm is gathering on the horizon
kit offers holly his hand as they run
but holly does not see this
cato lies motionless on his bed
holly steps forward and touches him with a yardstick like a child touching a snake
suddenly i was thrown into a state of shock
kit rifle in hand lumbers out a side door of the house with cato over his shoulder
he steers for a nearby box car that evidently served cato as a shed
kit was the most trigger happy person id ever met
he claimed that as long as youre playing for keeps and the law is coming at you its considered okay to shoot all witnesses
you had to take the consequences though and not whine about it later
kit opens the doors of the box car
and dumps cato inside
before closing the doors he checks catos shoes
to see if they are the ones he gave him
holly looks on from the side of the house twenty yards away
were in for it now
if they catch us
kit looks cornered and defensive
holly thinks for a moment
whatd you put him in there for
kit shrugging just to keep him out of the sun
kit heads out of sight around the rear of the box car
holly goes back inside
kit walks up and down the length of the box car talking under his breath and throwing his rifle from hand to hand in a state
kit and holly travel down a country road in the studebaker
at this moment i didnt feel shame or fear but just kind of blah like when youre sitting there and all the waters run out of the bathtub
kit driving turns to holly
yeah you look tired
when all this is over im going to sit down and buy you a big thick steak
i dont want a steak
well well see about that
he nods at a wrecked car lying in a ditch beside the road
theyre probably going to blame that on me too bastards
various shots characterizing the midwests reaction to kit and holly a deserted street law officers posing with their guns and ammunition children walking from class under armed guard a detective
in a trench coat pointing at a pump a woman calling in her children at dusk a county official posing with the county records the court reporter with a book of signatures vigilantes signing up and being deputized then riding through the streets of their town in the backs of pickups a priest among them etc
the whole country was out looking for us for who knew where kit would strike next
sidewalks were deserted
stores closed their doors and drew their blinds
posses and vigilante committees were set up from texas to north dakota
children rode back and forth to school under heavy guard
a famous detective was brought in from boston
he could find no clues
my clarinet teacher said i probably wasnt responsible but others said i was
then on thursday the governor of oklahoma sent out the national guard to stand watch at the federal reserve bank in tulsa when word got out that kit meant to
it was like the russians had invaded
kit and holly approach a large victorian mansion
kit rings the bell
we needed supplies so we went to a rich mans house
kit figured itd be safer and quicker than shopping in the downtown
a maid came to the door
a maid opens the door
hi i come to check the meter
my tools are in here
he nods at the suitcase he is carrying
the maid looks at holly
oh this is holly
shes from texas
kit winks at holly
the maid brushes her ears to indicate that she is deaf then stands back to let them pass
later we found out she was deaf and we hadnt even known it
they enter the house
kit leads the others into the living room
the owner of the house a rich man sits in a chair in the corner reviewing some prints
at the sight of kit he comes to his feet
this your place
kit looks around overwhelmed by the luxury of the mansion
sorry to barge in on you
anybody else here besides you two
the rich man is wary
kit nearly forgets to explain himself
oh uh were on the run and wed like to hang out here for a while
couple of hours maybe
howd that be
stay as long as you like
the camera pans across a mural of some pastoral scene
holly runs her finger around the lip of a crystal glass
it makes a soft chiming noise
kit sitting at the end of a table opposite her picks up a dinner bell rings it then puts it down and regards her solemnly
next time i ring that it means time to clear out
holly in the next angle has moved a bust off its pedestal onto the corner of a piano
she thinks better of this and restores the bust to its original position
kit sniffs at a glass of sherry then takes a picture off the mantel and studies it
holly at the other end of the room
tests the comforts of a chair
she moves to another chair and tests it too
she makes her hand limp
she watches it swing back and forth
kit sits in the chair which the rich man occupied earlier
he has a thoughtful look on his face
there is a dictaphone on the table beside him
holly takes a cane out of the umbrella rack looks around furtively then steps out a side door of the house
holly walks down the slope of the lawn
i left kit in the parlor and went for a stroll outside the house
the day was quiet and serene but i didnt notice for i was deep in thought and not even thinking about how to slip off
across the way she can see a long driveway with a border of lush greenery and a sleepy cat standing in the sun
the world was like a faraway planet to which i could never return
i thought what a fine place it was full of things for people to look into and enjoy
kit talks into the dictaphone recording some advice for young people
listen to your parents and teachers
they got a line on most things so dont treat them like enemies
theres always a chance you could learn something
he pauses for a moment try to keep an open mind
try to understand the viewpoint of others
consider the minority opinion but try to get along with the majority opinion once its accepted
again he pauses course holly and ive had fun even if it has been rushed and
so far were doing fine
hadnt got caught
annoyed excuse the grammar
he sets down the dictaphone
puts out his cigarette and leans back in his chair lost in reflection
holly enters the room where the rich man and his maid have been put
the furniture and paintings are covered with sheets suggesting that for some purpose known only to the family the room has been set aside
kits downstairs playing with the dictaphone
sometimes he acts like theres something wrong with his bean
she leans against the window
behind the couch where the rich man is sitting
hope nothing ever goes wrong with mine
think hes crazy huh
i dont know
hes kind of odd
she sits down beside the rich man
holly shyly they claim ive got him wrapped around my little finger but i never told him to shoot anybody
she looks the room over
gosh i like your house
we hear the noise of a doorbell
kit puts down a copy of the wall street journal and locates his pistol
he starts for the door then remembers that he moved a picture from the mantel
he puts the picture back in place checks the chamber of his pistol and leaves the room
kit opens the front door to find a visitor on the stoop
the visitor carries a roll of blueprints under his arm
ah mister scarborough here
yeah but the thing about him hes down with the flu
id invite you inside except its contagious
dont want to start an epidemic
no of course not
its only that he called last night and asked if i could come by
well he didnt have it last night
the visitor is puzzled by kits presence in the house and even more by his behavior
he takes out a note pad
well id like to leave a message if thats okay
the visitor jots something down and hands the note to kit
you have to excuse me now
i have to go back inside
kit closes the door
kit hides the visitors note in a vase and bounds up the stairs to the first landing
were out of here tex
he turns back down the stairs
on a rack at the bottom he finds a hat and coat
he takes them with him
kit walks into the room where he left the rich man and his maid
he now carries a bag of groceries under his arm hi whatcha doing
good a way to kill time as any
he points to the maid with his pistol
were going to take the cadillac for a while
howd that be
dont worry i wont let her drive
he means holly
kit continuing oh and heres a list of everything we borrowed
cars on there too
he gives the list to the rich man and signals the maid to accompany them out
okay maam lets go
kit points the rich man and his maid into a closet
youre my friend arent you
okay no monkey business then
he locks the door of the closet once they are inside starts off then remembers something takes a handkerchief out of his pocket and wipes his fingerprints off the door
with this reminder he collects his bag of groceries and heads down the hall
kit and holly come out the front door
holly wears a shawl over her head as a disguise kit wears the outfit he took off the rich mans coat rack
he carries his groceries rifle and a silver trophy he stole from somewhere in the house
that guy could sell that list i gave him as a sample of my handwriting
holly starts off kit continuing hey whyre you always walking ahead of me
well why you always walking behind me
kit grabs the seat of her pants
anybody ever done that to you before
guess theres no way ill ever know
they round a corner into the garden
they walk down the lawn toward the garage
we the ticking of sprinklers off camera
that guy must pay through the nose to keep this place up
lawn the gas and electric
plus the upkeep on the cars
yeah you get a little money in your pocket you think all your problems are solved
well let me tell you theyre not
they arrive at the cadillac
holly sets down her suitcase and waits for kit to open the door for her
kit who has forgotten this propriety hurries back and opens the door
he throws the suitcase in the back goes around the front of the car and gets in
id like to get out of here
soon as i start the car
and fix my hat
he adjusts his hat starts the car and they drive off past a rolls royce kit has declined in favor of the cadillac
the car races across the open prairie
fearing thered be roadblocks on the highways we took off across that area known as the great plains
kit told me to enjoy the scenery and i did
holly reads to kit from a movie fan magazine
rumor pat boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full time and complete his education
fact pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career its the education that will have to take the back seat
i dont blame him
rumor frank sinatra and rita hayworth are in love
fact true but not with each other
kit chuckles at this which pleases holly
the cadillac heads overland along a line of telephone poles that stretches out clear to the horizon
through desert and mesa across the endless miles of open range we made our headlong way steering by the telephone lines toward the mountains of montana
heat waves rise off the land
a mountain is barely discernible in the distance
the cadillac races through a herd of cows holly v
kitd sometimes ram a cow to save on ammo and wed cook it
tight shot of a clump of salt grass
once we had to eat a bunch of salt grass
it tasted like cabbage
the camera rises over the cadillac as it races down a deserted country road at dawn the cadillac is stopped beside a pipeline waystation
kit has tapped some gas off the head
for gas we used the leakage from the valves of the pipelines we found along the way
drip gas is what they call it in that part of the country
the cadillac roars through a stand of mesquite and disappears into the distance
little by little we approached the border
kit was glad to leave south dakota behind and cursed its name
he said that if the communists ever dropped the atomic bomb he wished theyd put it right in the middle of rapid city
they are camped out in the middle of the badlands
kit cooks some meat over a fire holly with a map under her arm points into the distance
thats montana over there
i never been to montana
acquaintance of mine has but i hadnt
never had any reason to
holly sits down and looks at the map
state birds a meadowlark
the camera pans across the badlands
there is not a tree or a bush in sight
it comes to rest on kit who carries his rifle over his shoulders the way james dean did in giant
various sights of the prairie a distant mountain a wild turkey a lizard a burst of lightening in a cloud on the horizon a falcon
kit takes all this in then he turns back to the campsite
the sun is down just barely and the moon has risen behind him
holly is heard over this last shot
we lived in utter loneliness neither here nor there
kit said that solitude was a better word cause it meant more exactly what i wanted to say
whatever the expression i told him we couldnt go on living this way
kit and holly sit in the back seat of the cadillac
they have been necking
her hair is in curlers
kit responding to v
i mean im having fun
at least im not bitching
well i feel kind of like an animal living out here
i mean theres no place to bathe and
no place to get anything good to eat
well ill catch you a big trout
soon as we get to the mountains
he kisses her
she gives in reluctantly
after a while they break
everybody loves trout
they neck some more
then break again
kit looks out one window holly out the other
a train moves slowly across the horizon
in the distance i saw a train making its way silently across the plain like the caravan in the adventures of marco polo
it was our first taste of civilization in days and i asked kit if we could have a closer look
kit sets a football down on the ground backs off a few steps squats and shoots a hole through it with his pistol
to his surprise
it does not deflate
he moves closer and pounds it flat with the barrel of the pistol
before we left he shot a football that he considered excess baggage
kit is burying some things from hollys suitcase in a bucket the trophy he took from the mansion her stereopticon slides a doll a spark plug a pack of camels
afterwards he took and buried some of our things in a bucket
he said that nobody else would know where wed put them and that wed come back someday maybe and theyd still be sitting here just the same but wed be
and if we never got back well somebody might dig them up a thousand years from now and wouldnt they wonder
the cadillac speeds across the plains
a plume of dust stretches out behind it
kit and holly have parked the cadillac under a rail trestle
a train is approaching
they hide beside the car
the train a streamliner roars overhead
when it has passed holly rushes up the grade to watch it disappear into the distance
kit watches from the opposite end of the trestle
maybe we shouldve tried to hop it
it was going too fast
i couldve pulled the car up on the tracks slowed it down some
yeah then wed be stuck here
well maybe we oughta be stuck here
im not saying that i know
he stoops down and picks up a pepsi bottle
he climbs over the edge of the trestle looks back at her oddly then leaps down to the ground
holly walks down to meet him
kit took the bottle and spun it around leaving to fate which direction we should take
kit spins the bottle
the bottle comes to a stop
kit inspects its position
he does not appear satisfied though
well maybe the slope here is throwing it off some
we ought to find a more flat place
how about over here
kit starts toward her then changes his mind and heads back up the grade to the tracks
the camera dollies and cranes with him
it doesnt matter
if im worth a damn ill pick the right direction
and if im not well i dont care
see what i mean
well i shouldnt expect miracles should i
he stops at the top of the grade and looks out across the badlands
well keep on heading for that mountain
just remember i said it wasnt such a hot idea
the cadillac pulls out from under the trestle and heads down a dusty road alongside the tracks
we took off at sunset on a line toward the mountains of saskatchewan for kit a magical land beyond the reach of the law
he needed me now more than ever but something had come between us
id stopped even paying attention to him
instead i sat in the car and read a map and spelled out entire sentences with my tongue on the roof of my mouth where nobody could read them
the cadillac beads off across the plains toward a distant mountain
that night we moved closer to the border and clear across the prairie at the very edge of the horizon
a refinery fire
w could make out the gas fires of the refinery at missoula while to the south
we could see the lights of cheyenne a city bigger and grander than id ever seen
the prairie rushes under the cadillacs headlights
i felt all kind of things looking at the lights of cheyenne but most important i made up my mind to never again tag around with a hell bent type
no matter how in love with him i was
finally i found the strength to tell kit this
i pointed out that even if we got to the far north he still couldnt make a living
kit and hollys faces are strangely lit by the dash lights
holly is absorbed in her map
the radio is on
responding to v
i could get a job with the mounties
the northwest mounties
hell i got all the qualifications
i can ride shoot and
i dont mind the cold
i kind of like the cold
holly looks up from the map
i was just running off at the mouth
i wasnt listening
holly lights a cigarette
i was just talking about going after a job
dont lip it
he reaches over and takes the cigarette out of her mouth
the camera pans to her with this gesture
theyd probably ask to see your drivers license before they hired you
im not going to let that stop me
when the camera pans back to him he is looking at her cigarette
you smoke pall mall
he is surprised to discover this
nah you hadnt seen me when im going after something honey
he cocks his head just thinking about it
she reaches for the radio to change the station
he pats her hand away
dont touch that
nat king cole
they dance in the headlights to the tune of a blossom fell coming over the car radio
she is wearing the rich mans jacket
after a moment kit whispers in her ear
boy if i could sing a song like that
i mean if i could sing a song about the way i feel right now itd be a hit
they continue dancing
two shots of the cadillac heading across the badlands at dawn
kit knew the end was coming
he wondered if hed hear the doctor pronounce him dead or if hed be able to read what the papers would say about him the next day from the other
he dreaded the iea of being shot down alone he said without a girl to scream out his name
holly yawns with fatigue
then for an instant the sight of the mountains in the dawn light got his hopes back up
kit shakes his head with admiration and wonder
god what a sight
tell me this honey
what does a little texas girl like yourself think of a sight like that
she turns to look at the mountains
mountains in the distance closer now than ever before
the cadillac drives up to an oil rig
kit gets out of the car
love this air
the roughneck in charge of the rig steps out of his trailer
it seems there is nobody else around
say you got any gas
but weve got to ask you for it
holly walks over to inspect the rig
see were about out
been driving all night
actually i dont even have time to explain it to you
well matter of fact i dont have any
just a second now
thats your truck
he points to a truck linked to the front of the trailer
holly looks idly around
suddenly her expression changes for what reason it is not clear
you didnt walk out here
its mine all right
im going to swap you my cadillac
the roughneck does not understand what kit is up to
now dont worry
youre getting a fair deal
whats the blue book value on this thing mildred
he slaps the hood of the cadillac and looks to holly
she is still preoccupied with whatever it is she has seen though
who are you
name is carruthers
believe i shoot people every now and then
not that i deserve a medal
holly signals kit with a nod at the horizon
kit looks up and sees a helicopter in the distance
he hesitates a moment then draws his gun
just gimme a chance
holly moves around the side of the rig and sits against a tire
kit joins her
i had a feeling today was going to be the day
hes not coming to take us for a ride
come on lets make a run for the car
he starts off in the direction of the car but holly calls him back
i dont want to
kit looks at her
have you got a better idea
i just dont want to go
he stares at her for a moment then bows his head and walks off a distance
what is wrong with you huh
he kicks wildly at dust
what is the matter with you huh
meanwhile the helicopter continues its approach
kit walks in closer to holly
boy i dont know what to make of you
people like you
he kicks at the rigs then turns back to face her
you want a second chance then listen
twelve noon the grand coulee dam new yearss day
you meet me there
now you got that
she nods bewildered
the helicopter is landing
he grabs a discarded fender off the truck hangs it over his arm like a shield and runs to the cadillac exchanging shots with a state trooper who has arrived
in the helicopter
the trooper is hit and falls
kit jumps in the car and roars off
holly surrenders herself to the pilot of the helicopter and is taken off
kit pulls into a gas station
he gets out of his car and drums on the roof
hey anybody here
an attendant walks out the door
say you got any shells for a savage a
i pissed all mine away shooting up bottles
you want to fill her up for me
the attendant nods
kit pulls hollys suitcase out of the back seat and walks over to a trash can at the edge of the apron
kit throws hollys things methodically into the trash can
after a while he comes upon a book
he opens the book and looks through it then turns to find the attendant staring at him
as he gets to his feet
he nods at the trash can
if you want any of that junk its yours
meanwhile a police car approaches the station
kit sees it at about the same time the police see him
he throws his book in the car and roars out of the station
the police car goes into a bootleggers turn and takes off after him
kit heads down the highway
after a while he turns off onto a dirt road
the police keep up with him
he flips on the radio and fires back at them
the dust is so heavy that they have a hard time just keeping track of him
he checks his own appearance and general demeanor in the rear view mirror then swerves off the road onto the prairie
the police manage to keep up
together they roar through a herd of cows and barb wire fence
the police car slams into kit trying to slow him down
kit slams back into the police car
they return to the road
kit makes a ninety degree turn but the police car loses traction and rolls onto its side then back onto four wheels again stalled
kit sees that he has lost them
he checks himself out in the mirror again puts on the rich mans hat and skids to a stop
the police car gets back underway
during these last few moments holly is heard on voice holly v
often ive wondered what was going through kits head before they got him and why he didnt make a run for it while he still had the chance
did he figure theyld just catch up with him the next day
was it despair
he claimed to having a flat tire but the way he carried on about it i suspect this is false
kit shoots a hole in the tire of the cadillac then climbs up on the hood
we see how far behind the police are
he checks his pulse and jumps back down
he scurries around collecting rocks from the shoulder as the police approach from the distance
he makes a stack of the rocks to mark the site of his capture for posterity finishing just as the police car skids to a stop
kit throws up his hands and walks forward to meet them
their guns are drawn
hold it right there
i couldve held off an army if i couldve gotten behind a rock in the mountains
kit nodding long as my ammo held out
right theres where you caught me
he nods at the stack of rocks
the sheriff frisks him as the deputy covers
we did it ray
you better not leave that cadillac sitting out here
the sheriff takes out a pair of handcuffs
put your hands in back of your head
the sheriff claps the handcuffs on one of kits wrists
now put the other one on yourself
kit does as the sheriff asks
the deputy holsters his pistol and walks forward to inspect their prize
he and kit exchange glances
deputy to sheriff hell he aint no bigger than i am
the sheriff sticks his pistol in kits ear and leads him off toward the police car
youre going to give me a cauliflower ear sheriff
the sheriff gives kit a shove
he shouldve thought about that before he got caught
the deputy draws his pistol and fires a shot into the neighboring field
kit is startled
the deputy makes the same motion this time without firing
the police car sails down an open stretch of highway
kit thinks for a while then turns to the sheriff who is driving
think ill take the juice
the deputy fascinated watches all this from the back seat
kit turns to him
say what kind of rifle was that you were shooting at me
thirty aught six
you ever had to open it up like that before
kit turns back around
kit reassuringly well you boys have performed like a couple of heroes
and dont think im not going to pass it around when we get to town
the sheriff lifts the hat off kits head and tosses it out the window
it rolls to a stop on the highway behind them
you tossed my hat out the window
wanta sue me
kit ive got a question for you
you like people
then whyd you do it
i dont know
always wanted to be a criminal i guess
just not this big a one
takes all kinds though
kit gets a smile from the deputy
the deputy turns to the sheriff
you know who that sombitch looks like
no reply you know dont you
kit is anxious to hear the answer
ill kiss your ass if he dont look like james dean
kit drops his eyes and turns away deeply gratified by this remark
the sheriff smiles at the deputy in the rear mirror
the car roars past a freight train
kit stands on the wing of a light plane inside a large hangar at the local airport
he is shackled in a leather transfer vest
he takes souvenirs out of his pockets and tosses them out to a crowd of montana state troopers and national guardsmen milling around on the tarmac ground below him
how you doing there kit
fine as can be expected
just locked up cant move
thats a nice little coat you got on there
he takes out his cigarette lighter
hey now heres a real prize
i mustve had this about ten years
whos going to get it
gimme that sombitch
there you go
second voice o
where you from
where you from
second voice o

he takes a comb out of his pocket and pitches it down to somebody
he ignores most of the questions coming at him
third voice o
joni james is from south dakota
yeah she got out of there too
fourth voice o
you ever been to kansas
fifth voice o
whots your favorite singer
fifth voice o

he pitches the man a ballpoint
the camera moves back to a wide shot of the whole scene
sixth voice o
how old are you
dont you read the papers
you ever been married
no sir i hadnt
various shots of the national guardsmen dozing on the pavement
playing cards beside the hangar a little bored
also a shot of holly with the sheriff and deputy
seventh voice o
hey kit you afraid of death
i hadnt thought about it much
the deputy walks up to kit with some legal papers
hey listen tom i dont mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching
what do you say now
i need to get your signature on some papers here kit
well ive got to read them first
suppose i could get a coke while i do
he gives kit the papers and leads him out of the hangar
kit turns back to the crowd inside
you boys keep out of trouble
dont worry about us
hollys over here kit
if you want to see her
holly leans against the fender of the police car
she wears handcuffs
kit turns to a state trooper who holds him by a tether
you want to give me a little slack here
the trooper pays out the slack
kit leans against the car
he and holly exchange looks
dont worry now
im going to get you off these charges
theres a whole lot of other boys out there
youre going to have a lot of fun
holly looks down
boy we rang the bells didnt we
holly does not reply
ill say one thing though
that guy with the deaf maid
hes just lucky hes not dead too
holly does not appreciate the humor of this
kit chastened turns serious
course its too bad about your dad
were going to have to sit down and talk about that sometime
he looks up at the sound of an incoming plane
the plane that will take them back to south dakota a b comes in for a landing
the mass of troopers and national guardsmen with kit and holly walks out to meet it
a jeep leads it down the taxiway
a civilian bystander points kit and holly out to a young boy he holds in his arms
kit signs his extradition papers on the back of the chief trooper gives them to the deputy and shakes hands with the chief
thank you very much chief sims
sorry if i caused you any inconvenience
you didnt cause me any trouble
he turns to shake hands with the deputy
the planets engines whir to life
good luck to you
i mean it
i know you do
good luck to you too
now we go
the trooper pulls him toward the plane
kit calls holly
come on red
the props start turning
the crowd waves goodbye as the boarding door is closed
the wheels turn toward the sun
the guardsmen race back to their trucks
a mailman carries off the mail bags he collected from the plane
the plane taxies down the runway and lifts into the air
kit and i were taken back to south dakota
they kept him in solitary so he didnt have a chance to get acquainted with the other inmates though he was sure theyd like him especially the murderers
myself i got off with probation and a lot of nasty looks
later i married the son of the lawyer who defended me
pause kit went to sleep in the courtroom while his confession was being read and he was sentenced to die in the electric chair
on a warm spring night six months later after donating his body to science he did
with hollys last words we cut inside the cabin of the plane
kit sits next to the trooper at the back of the plane
holly sits opposite them with a detective behind her
kits attention is fixed on the military hat in the troopers lap
whered you get that hat
boy id like to buy me one of those
the trooper smiles
holly looks up
youre quite an individual kit
think theyll take that into consideration
the trooper smiles and looks out the window
kit looks to holly to see if she has taken this remark in the proper spirit
she smiles and looks out the window
an unbroken sea of clouds stretches out before her
