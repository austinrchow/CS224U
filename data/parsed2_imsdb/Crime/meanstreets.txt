please him buy gifts dont steal dont lift twenty years of schoolin and they put you on the day shift subterranean homesick blues a darkened diffused image of a man lying on the ground
a tree is above him
the image is more diffused on the edges
it is black and white and appears to be coming from a television
the body of the man is practically totally in shadow
ladies and gentlemen on the new tonight the first actual motion pictures of death
a small orange fire appears in the breast of the man
watch closely at the moment of death
the small orange fire fades away
charles cappa jr
charlie is of sicilain origin
he was educated in roman catholic parochial schools with one year and a half at a jesuit college
charlie was raised sternly in the roman catholic tradition but now has rejected many of the religions tenets
he is very intelligent and has a sharp sense of humor
he is always well dressed
his favorite authors are ernest hemingway thomas hardy and theodore dreiser
he likes reading but enjoys films more
he is very fond of the new testament and often exchanges quotes from it with his friend tony
charlie has been dreaming
the dream frightened him
a title appears on the bottom of the frame charlie
he gets up to look at his face in the mirror
his room is lit by moonlight
it is a small tenement bedroom with a fire escape outside
he returns to bed and as his head hits the pillow we hear the ronettes singing be my baby
projector whirring away
opening titles appear over mm
home movies in which charlie is shown along with his friends and family in a celebration
a sense of one big unending party
during this opening segment we see some of the characters that will later appear in the story johnny boy michael tony teresa charlies uncle giovanni and others
they are all sicilian and are members of the same italian american neighborhood in new york city
we sense from these home movies that the neighborhood forces its people to be strongly tied together in a way of life family church friendship
these home movies were taken during some formal and casual gatherings in which charlie participated
a longhaired freak is about to shoot up
suddenly the door opens and tony anthony devenziano comes in
tony is totally different in appearance and dress from the freak
he is and a part time student studying liberal arts
his father is a very powerful racketeer in a different part of the city and owns several night club type discotheques and strip houses on the west side of town
one of these is operated by tony tonys place
charlie is one of his closest friends
tony is well dressed flippant and reckless
he is a big drinker liquor wine and even cough medicine
what the fuck
tony rushes over to the freak who is too strung out to defend himself smashes the needle and slaps him around
not in my fuckin place
tony pushes him out the door and into the bar area
there are a few people in the bar
mainly neighborhood guys like tony
a few freaks are in the bg
tony pushes him out the front door
and keep the fuck out a here
i know your face
tony crosses over to one of the neighborhood guys by the bar and slaps him in the back of the head knocking off his hat
and you scumbag
what did i tell you bout passin that shit in my huh
hey i didnt do nothin
cut it out
tony pushes the boy out of the bar also
title appears on the bottom of the frame tony the area is totally deserted except for two trucks parked side by side
two men are tossing boxes from one truck to another and looking around furtively
michael stands nearby
michael longo is years old
he lives in a different neighborhood but comes from the same type of background as charlie and the others
he runs an illegitimate bar and dabbles in the yearly sale of firecrackers which he smuggles in from maryland
he also deals in contraband cigarettes and runs a small time loan shark business
he has a knack for business but he is otherwise unintelligent
michael crosses over to a black oldsmobile
hey hurry up with that shit will ya
michael gets in the car
another man is sitting in the back
he is also well dressed
michael takes a small lens out of his pocket and tosses it to the man
that aint shit
thats a german lens
the man looks at it carefully
a good buy
good two shipments of them
cant use it
thats a telescopic one
first it aint german
and second this aint no lens
its like a
so you got two shipments of jap adaptors with no lenses
man hands adaptor back to michael
a jap adaptor
title appears on bottom of screen michael
a deserted warehouse area in lower manhattan
prominent in the frame is a brightly painted red white and blue mailbox contrasting with the drab hues of the neighborhood
johnny boy walks down the street toward camera
john civello johnny boy is years old
he is an only child and lives with his mother a divorcee
he is clean cut looking yet slightly radical in dress
he was expelled from high school for vandalism and consequently spent several months in reform school
he is reckless unambitious nihilistic and was classified a psychiatric f
he is first cousin of teresa ronchali who lives next door to charlie
he has adopted teresas family as his own and spends more time with them than he does with his mother
johnny is carrying a package wrapped in plain brown paper under his arm and he is smiling
he drops the package into the mailbox and keeps walking
but he is moving a little faster now and smiling a little more
suddenly the mailbox explodes
dozens of red white and blue fragments shower down on the street
the impact of the blast knocks johnny down
title appears on bottom of frame
he is up in a moment
the camera tracks with him as he starts running
we see that he is grinning quite literally like crazy
we see charlie full face
behind him is a confessional booth
the church is very old quiet and dark
the camera zooms out to reveal rows of holy candles lit in the foreground
charlie suddenly begins to speak softly and confidentially to an unseen entity that is off screen
as you know ive just come out of confession
and as a penance they gave me ten hail marys and ten our fathers
now between you and me
you know how i feel about such things
the camera has now trucked behind charlie and we see over his head he has been addressing a life sized statue of the crucified body of christ eyes closed reclining
in his sepluchure
if im going to do penance at all ill do it the way i think it would be done
by me that is
according to my own trespasses
you know what i mean
this conversation of confession will occur from time to time in other parts of the story as charlie will periodically try very casually to justify his thoughts and actions to
the images accompanying these monologues are to be of free association almost documentary in nature
the club is dark and noisy and smokey when charlie enters
he greets tony who is sitting on a bar stool
tony directs charlie to a corner of the club where the rest of the group is now getting boisterously drunk
charlie joins in immediately taking on the mood of the group
the rest of the club is filled with many different types of customers teenagers adults pretending to be teenagers sailors male and female gays and the boys from the neighborhood
the music is loud and the lights are flashing but the strippers have not yet appeared
tony is at the bar
he is approached by george one of the bouncers
he seems upset about the noise that charlie and his friends are creating
tony doesnt take george very seriously
its ten oclock and theyre like this
and theyre just starting
what are you smiling at
this is a business night
did i ever tell you the story about the three chickens
charlies zany behavior as frenetically as it occurs
there is no particular logical sequence except that events are suited to the rythmic pattern of the music
charlie and his friends dance and sing along with the music
charlie picks up a billiard stick
he attempts to hit a filled shot glass towards tony at the other end of the bar
charlie tries to pull a tablecloth off of a strangers table without moving the glasses or bottles
this also fails
a punch is thrown at someone
a lit cigarette in the punchers fist creates a swift arc of light in the darkness
the strippers finally appear on stage
charlie becomes obsessed with the negro stripper diane
he shouts to her tosses things and calls her names
she tries half amusedly to ignore him but she cant
tony drinks from a bottle of southern comfort and as a chaser swigs down aqua velva
charlie sitting at an empty table watching diane the stripper perform again
he stares glassy eyed and then begins to speak softly continuing his confession
shes really good looking
really good looking
ive gotta say that again
shes really good looking
but shes black
you can see that real plain
as an afterthought when you get down to it though
theres not much of a difference is there
he waits for an answer well
he smiles and begins chewing on an ice cube from his half suddenly michael appears and sits down at charlies table
he hands charlie two cartons of cigarettes
for these prices dont be particular
thats all they had but next week well see
charlie gives him the money
sell em if you cant smoke them
ill be ok for a week
you seen johnny boy tonight
isnt he supposed to be here tonight
i dont know
what am i supposed to be his keeper or something
yeah hes supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head
id like to know charlie it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me
charlie remains silent
charlie dont you think you should be interested in johnnys payments to me
i think you should be you know that
michael nobodys out to screw you i guarrantee that
i know that charlie but look at my side
you undersigned the loans
you vouched for him
what happens if this kid dont pay me
i gotta collect from you
i dont want to do that
i made a deal with him not you right
look im not gonna wind up paying his debts
you know that
i dont know that
thats what im telling you
michael believe me
you know the kids a little crazy sometimes
i vouched for him and hell come through
ill talk to him and straighten him out
dont worry ok
johnny boy enters the night club with two friends
he has been drinking
johnny boys face shows fresh cuts and bruises
his friends approach the hat check girl and give her their coats
johnny boy approaches her giving her his pants instead
his friends laugh hysterically
charlie is now alone at the end of the bar
johnny boy now completely dressed enters the bar area
charlie watches johnny boy approaching and continues his confession
johnny boy greets people as he passes them and as charlie speaks he appears to be moving in slow motion
what do you think
if a man have a hundred sheep and one of them stray will he not leave the ninety nine in the mountains and go in search of the one that
and if he happen to find it amen i say to you he rejoices over it more than over the ninety nine that did not go astray
even so it is not the will of your father in heaven that a single one of these little ones should perish
ok thats very nce but
tony is now behind the bar near charlie
johnny boy has reached them
drinks for everybody tony
where have you been
and a double for you and charlie here
quietly to tony and put it on my tab willya
which one the big tab or the little tab
put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one
yeah so thingsll be even
charlie and johnny boy grimace
how about me
i dont get a drink john
a double for michael tony
johnny boy interrupts michael who is about to speak
i know what youre going to say but dont say it
these drinks are all on the tab
im gonna see you this tuesday payday i promise
i give you my word
the drinks arrive
they all smile and salute each other with their drinks
charlie and johnny boy are sitting alone at a table
refering to johnny what happened to you flash
charlie i swear on my mother youre not going to believe this
i know but lets hear it anyway
i swear to god charlie its the truth
johnny boy is walking along the street
it is rush hour and the traffic is heavy
a shiny late model car stops parallel to johnny boy
the young boy sal signals him by blowing the horn
note that in the flashback johnny boys face is not bruised
hey johnny wherere you goin
this is some boat
just had it delivered
you got stereo
yeah i think so
as johnny boy admires the gadgets in the car he notices that sal is becoming very nervous
you got a speaker back there
he turns to look for the speaker and sees a police car not far behind
theres a funny lookin cab behind us
forget your registration
its just that i
this aint my car
yeah its your fathers
you mean its heisted
you could say that
announcing it loudly this is a heisted car
sal smiles sheepishly
johnny boy panics
the police switch on their flashing red light and try to get closer to them but the traffic is too heavy
sal manages to turn the next corner at about twenty miles per hour
johnny boy frightened now underestimates the speed of the car and quickly opens the door
johnny boy tumbles from the car only to smack into a lamp post
he has seriously banged his head and blood is running down his face
but because of the near proximity of the police car he is desperately trying to maintain an air of dignity as he calmly tries to walk down the street
tony has now joined the group sitting at the table
charlie and tony nod in disbelief
its the truth i swear
all right forget it
tony you got anything we can put on his face
yeah in the back
they all get up
cmon i got something to show you anyway
they push their way through the crowd and enter a narrow dimly lit hallway on both sides
a boy and girl are necking on a make shift couch in the darkened room
jimmy i tell you theres something in this room
ahhh come on baby
cut it out
suddenly the light is turned on
tony charlie and johnny boy enter the room
the girl is startled and jumps up
jimmy appears bewildered
excuse us jimmy well only be a moment
the girl and jimmy sit self consciously as tony goes to the medicine cabinet takes out a few items and gives them to charlie
tony then crosses to the other side of the room where he removes the blanket which has been covering a large cage
he reveals a live young beautiful panther stalking to and fro
the girl screams
i told you there was something in this room
the girl runs out
everyone else except tony is backed up against the wall frightened
the boys laugh nervously
keep quiet about this
i dont have any license for him yet
ive only had him a couple of days
nobody can feed him except me
im the only one he trusts
dont go to any trouble
we believe you
we believe you
tony begins to open the cage
the boys are now standing on top of the nearest pieces of furniture
really wanted to get a little tiger charlie yknow
a little william blake and all that
tony ignores charlies warning as he crouches and allows the animal to wander onto his lap where upon he strokes the panther gently murmuring to him
the boys watch in silence
the italian song malafemina a tango like rythmn is heard coming from the juke box
it is near closing time and there are only a few customers left in the club including michael and two gays benton and sammy who is getting very drunk
charlie is at the corner table with tony and johnny boy
charlie is washing johnny boys face with cold water from a basin
some of johnnys blood has mingled with the water
im surprised at you tone
i mean youve had the place for over a year now
same old place
tony ignores charlies half joking drunken remarks
for instance the difference between me and you is this
you take that panther back there
id put him right up here above the bar
nice cage you know
nothing ordinary in my place
what good is it
you get robot customers
they come in drink beer go to the bathroom and go home
one of the boys more casual acquaintances is lying on the bar drunk
he begins to sing along with the italian music but very badly
see what i mean
a question please
is this what you call living
take a little tip from mack the knife
tony break down and open another bottle willya
a well dressed young boy enters the club
george the bouncer approaches him
im just waiting for joey
the boy walks over to a bar stool and sits down
nobody acknowledges his presence
suddenly the drunk on the bar stops singing and sits up dazed
his sudden silence causes charlie and the others to look up at him
the drunk stares ahead for a minute
i gotta go to the bathroom
well go ahead whaddaya want
someone to hold it for you
even the boy at the bar laughs
the drunk rises still smiling and stumbles off to the mens room
the big bopper chantilly lace in playing on the soundtrack
charlie is playing with a deck of cards
continuing previous conversation this place is dead
if i had a place
johnny boy is sipping his drink and ignoring the conversation
and i wouldnt call it tonys place or charlies place
id call it something like season of the witch
you are with out a doubt the biggest most pretentious bullshit thrower i know
like to see what kind of business youd do
look whos talking
whos the guy with william blake and the tigers eh
will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers
tony you gonna close the place we get out of here get something to eat or what
well close up as soon as everybody leaves
dont forget whats his name there in the bathroom
jimmy is drawing on a table top
charlie wanders over
wanna see your picture
charlie leans over
overhead view shows large crude swastika
but keep trying
charlie picks up the cards again
lets have a game after we close
cmon tony waddaya say
anybody wanna have a game
the people in the bar do not respond
the boy casually leaves the bar and walks to the mens room
the boy slowly swings the door open and stares at the drunk leaning over the urinal half asleep
he takes out his pistol and calmly shoots the drunk three times in the back
to the boys surprise the drunk does not immediately fall dead
instead he turns and grabs the boy by the throat
they struggle in the open doorway
the italian music is still playing
everyone in the bar has frozen in position as they watch the scene
in his astonishment charlie allows the cards to fall from his hands
the young boy breaks away from the drunk and runs towards the exit
the drunk running only on sheet determination stumbles along after the boy
the people in the bar including charlie dash behind tables and jump behind the bar for cover
the boy reaches the exit and fires at the drunk from the top of the stairs
the drunk still follows
the boy runs down the street and disappears into the darkness
the drunk staggers out into hte cobblestone street
his mind is gone it is now just a physical matter of the body being stopped by the presence of a stationary object
he staggers straight across the street at tremendous speed smashing directly into a parked car
everyone including the two gays at the bar is running out the back way
everyone split up
michael and jimmy turn the corner and calmly walk to his parked car
as they get into the car charlie and johnny boy turn the corner
michael give us a lift
ok get in
as they are getting into the car the two gays turn the corner
one of them sammy is very drunk and is crying hysterically
his companion benton is trying to calm him down when he notices michael
it is obvious that michael does not want to take them but he is also afraid of attracting any attention so he quickly ushers them into the car
get in get in
charlie and johnny boy are in the back seat
sammy crawls over charlie into the back seat making apologies
benton is forced into the front seat with michael and jimmy
they drive off with sammy crying
oh jesus christ
sammy get control of yourself
yes youre gettin it all over my tie
should i slap him
suddenly in control you wouldnt dare
im terribly sorry guys
its just that he was terribly frightened
just keep him quiet
friends of yours michael
sensing the hostility oh
im benton and this is sammy
i cant get over the way he just kept going at him
must have been all the liquor in him
he returns to english
where should i drop you charlie
interrupting the conversation yes charlie your place or mine
away from the neighborhood
sammy leans over johnny and charlie to see out the window
he begins to shout at a young boy on the street
i love you
charlie and johnny boy hide their faces
hey shut up
get him in
are you kidding
sammy get in here this minute
theyre all beautiful
ill suck them all
ill suck them all
charlie and johnny boy groan
they are still hiding their faces
he pulls the car over to the nearest corner

yeah thanks its ok
charlie and johnny boy get out of the car first so that by the time benton and sammy are out they are already on their way down the street
michael drives away
going our way
to johnny boy dont answer
benton guides sammy the opposite way
charlie and johnny boy are walking down the street on their way home
i dont think i should go home looking like this
you think i could stay at your place tonight
your mothers not there is she
no she isnt
charlie lives in a typical lower east side tenement apartment
each room is painted a different pastel color
it is furnished in miscellaneous styles and from the pictures on the wall and various knick knacks around the rooms it is evident that this is a family apartment rather
than a bachelors pad
charlie is helping his mother pack a suitcase
through out the scene he is addressing her but she is never seen on camera
the camera pans following his movements and charlie directs his conversation always towards but above and beyond it
listen ill be ok
its the best thing
youre not going to be able to take care of grandma out here and still get to work you know that
yes the place will be here ill take care of it
yeah dont worry about me ill take care of myself
he moves into the bedroom taking more items out of the drawers
the room is ver small
the paint if peeling
over the double bed there is a large crucifix
mom look just dont worry
charlie and johnny boy are lying on charlies mothers bed in their underwear
youd better make a move kid

charlie reaches out to grab him
johnny is raiding the icebox
you got nothing here
from the other room i could have told you that
well get some food from my aunts
ill get in through the fire escape
shes always got something
johnny boy leaves the kitchen and walks towards the bedroom
dont do that
youll scare teresa if you try to sneak in
johnny boy is now by the window looking out at the fire escape mischieviously
maybe shell have a seizure and we can watch
charlie hits johnny boy on the back of the head
thats not funny
you gonna be a jerk off all your life
you want something to eat from your aunts house you go knock on her door understand
im not hungry anymore
im going to bed
johnny boy gets into bed
charlie goes into the kitchen to get a glass of milk
charlie takes a glass of milk from the icebox
he listens to the sounds of the neighborhood waking up and getting ready to go to work
he leaves the kitchen
charlie returns to the bedroom
johnny boy appears to be asleep
charlie goes to the window and peers through the blinds
he sees in the window across the fire escape
a series of dissolves
teresa is going through the various stages of getting dressed
teresa ronchali is years well built attractive and intelligent
she is well read and quiet
the salary she makes as a secretary in a book publishing firm practically supports her family
she has epilepsy which has prevented her in her own mind from entering into any serious relationships with men
she has however been having an affair with charlie for the past year
it is a well kept secret from both families because the families regard each other as blood relations
charlie is startled by johnny boy who is now awake and has begun to dial the telephone
pretending to be angry hello
i want to report a disturbance
yeah this man and woman next door are disturbing the peace
theyre keeping me awake all night now
what the hell is this
yelling fighting throwing things
if they dont kill each other soon im goin over there and do the job myself
yes the address is mott street
i think its apartment r
look i demand immediate action
never mind my name i dont like getting involved in things like this
he hangs up roughly and returns to his position in bed
charlie shakes his head with an exasperated smile as if this was a common occurance
charlie turns back to look at teresa but she is no longer in her room
charlie is dreaming this sequence
he and teresa are both nude
she is lying face down on the bed
he approached and ejaculates prematurely however he doesnt ejaculate sperm instead blood
they are shocked
the blood is on the bed her legs back and his hands
charlie cries out in pain
charlie and teresa are in the hotel room making love
the sounds of traffic can be heard from the street below
they are getting dressed
id like to eat something before i go back to work
ok well go for lunch
do you have enough
charlie checks his wallet
with the hotel thats ten
she hands him a few bills
please take it
i dont mind
she puts the money into his hand
its not that
touching his face its all right
well if things go the way i hope theyll go this money business will take care of itself
an apartment uptown
maybe who knows
nobody knows anything believe me
she kisses him gently
teresa is putting on her stockings
a few minutes have passed
see if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws
at your place
like restaurants night clubs
what is it now
he gives her a quick kiss on the tip of her nose
hey did you hear any more about what happened last night
christ you should have seen it
the kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like rasputin
that kid was scared
not half as much as we were though
it doesnt make any sense
he wouldnt shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy
not unless it was personal
you missed the point
the kids a climber
not very bright
but if you get down to his level to look at it his way he kills a guy who insulted a big man he gets a reputation
he thinks hes in good standing
its still sick
speaking of stupid your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mothers house
to get some food
teresa laughs at this story but her mood changes suddenly
youre sure he doesnt know
he takes her in his arms
charlie enters the bathroom to clean up
he stares at his image in the mirror for a moment then makes a face
he checks the whiteness of his teeth pulls back his hair and checks his complexion
the mirror image begins to speak
the camera pans back to charlies face
his mouth is not moving
dont look at me like that i can see this is not going to get us anywhere
shes a good kid what am i supposed to do
in a way im doing her a favor
how many guys you know feel this way about an epileptic
dont get me wrong im no saint
the image of charlie in the bathroom intercuts with stills from catholic school text books vulgar color illustrations of parables emphasis on christ expelling the devils from the posessed women
but im not like the pharisee who said oh god i thank thee that i am not like the rest of them
i like to think of myself as the publican
he strikes his breast penitently as he delivers the next line
oh god be merciful to me the sinner
im not taking advantage of her
i swear to you that if she meets someone shed like to marry
back to charlie in sync
ill cut out
if thy eye is an occasion of sin to thee
stills of girls sexy pornographic nude magazine spreads
pluck it out and cast it from thee
woe to the man through whom scandal does come
im sure youd agree this is no time to get tied down
like the priesthood
textbook illustration of vocations
they dont get tied down do they
have i not a right to do what i chose
even so the last shall be first and the
charlie in sync
for many are called but few are chosen
charlie is sitting in a quiet corner of the restaurant
this restaurant was considered an above average business with quality and prices to match when it was first opened three years ago
the quality has diminished but the prices remain the same
as a result the place is dying
charlie is scrutinizing the restaurant from his corner
he picks up a water goblet and critically examines the water spots on it
he calls a waitress to show her the dirt on the glass
she apologizes cleans it with her apron and places it back on the table
he takes a menu
a chubby middle aged man oscar approaches the table
he is half owner of the decaying restaurant
he is in his shirt sleeves which along with the side of his face are smeared with grease and dirt
he is tired and disgusted
with a slight jewish accent hey
they told me youre here
and youre here
how are you
ok hows everything going
oscar sits down next to charlie
do you have any idea what ive been doing all morning
i was in the basement fixing the pipes
would you believe that
the ones from last year
charlie shakes his head in sympathy
look charlie youre a good boy

there is nothing to give him
no envelopes with cash inside no checks nothing
that bad huh
i cant make this weeks payment and if this keeps up not next weeks either

i tell you if he dont give a damn then i dont give a damn
why should i kill myself
my uncle figured that this week was bad
but about next week
maybe you should speak to him yourself
what can i say
charlie is walking down the street on the lower east side
a noisy religious street festival is being held on the block
charlie enters a small italian cafe and nods greetings to some of the people as he makes his way to the back of the room
this cafe is a strange hybred of coffee house candy store luncheonette and meeting place for charlies uncle giovanni and his associates
giovanni de stefano is sixty
he is well respected and powerful both in and out of the neighborhood
he became a head figure not by being introduced formally as was the custom but rather by fighting and killing his way into the organization
giovanni is well dressed but not a stereotype of an old mafioso rather a kindly and intelligent old man
giovanni converses intermittently in italian
a man is putting new records into the jukebox which is in the corner of the room in the luncheonette area
to repair man is my uncle back there
charlie points in the direction of a doorway
yeah but i think hes busy now
hey charlie play today for sure
charlie walks through the luncheonette area past the dining room where his uncle is in conference to the bathroom at the very back of the cafe
mario is seated with his uncle
mario is forty five years old
he is giovannis closest associate brought into the organization in the traditional manner making his early reputation through hits murders
he is not very intelligent but has an undying loyalty to giovanni and is very fond of charlie
mario and giovanni are seated with a very old man
they are deep in their private conversation
charlie passes by unnoticed and walks into the bathroom
charlie begins to wash his hands but changes his mind
he shuts off the faucet in order to eavesdrop on the conversation
giovanni and mario are calmly sipping their coffee as they listen to the old mans nervous talk
in italian with what im telling you is that he did it for marios honor
but you dont understand
i knew the kid
he was drunk
he made of fool of himself
in italian with giovanni an insult to mario is an insult to you
there was no insult
in italian with the boy only did what was right
your son only did what was stupid
we have enough down here without something like that
and what for
i didnt tell him to do anything for me
hes going to miami
keep him in miami for six months
a good long time
after everythings forgotten then i see what i can do for him
keep him away
charlie is seated at a table
the waitress marie approaches and gives him his cup of coffee
the following scene is reminiscent of a television commercial
marie are there columbian coffee beans in this coffee
just a second
let me taste it
he pauses to sip the coffee then shakes his head
yes id say there are some columbian coffee beans in this coffee but only about
marie is disinterested
you probably dont notice this marie but colombian coffee beans are rich coffee beans
bursting with that good deep coffee flavor
picked when they are ripe to the point of perfection
the beans of course are protected by the tall south american guama trees
marie chews her gum for a moment and leaves the table
charlies monologue continues and gradually he falls back into his confession
as he talks the camera picks up details of the cafe and the people in it
then the bean pickers come down and pick each bean by hand
bean by bean all heavy with flavor
and they load them into boxes one box at a time box by box
from time to time charlie is casually glancing at marie who is busy with her work
the images now move out of the cafe and the camera reveals aspects of the neighborhood live action and stills stores people streets buildings in short a concise vision of
all this is intercut with charlie mentally stripping maries clothes off with his eyes
like looking at my uncle back there
one way is the obvious man outside the law
on the other hand instead of a breakdown of order there is a creation of order and instead of the breakdown of law there is the creation of law
in this society which needs new law because whats a crowbar compared to a share of stock
whats the robbing of a bank compared to the founding of one and whats the murder of a man to the gainful employment of that man
do not think that i have come to destroy the law or the prophets
i have not come to destroy but to fulfill
the image culminate in aerial shots of downtown new york city
stock footage charlie now sees marie totally naked as she serves the customers
giovanni and charlie are standing and talking
uncle how are you feeling
did you have a good time last night
about that shooting last night
i was there and
no you werent
charlie is struck silent for a moment
youre right uncle
i must have gotten it confused with something else
yes you did
charlie and giovanni are now sitting at a table
i think he put on this act
about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that
he cant make the payments
i dont know what to make of it
he says groppis run off with a girl
i could help if you want
his business is bad
but ill decide what to do and you
and you just keep out of anything that might
er draw attention to you
ill be careful
charlie and teresa are sitting on the beach which is fairly deserted
there are rented cottages behind them
teresa has a book and some papers from which she is supposed to write a term paper for charlies english class
one more day
ill call in sick for work
we can come back in a couple of weeks
besides if were both gone for three days it wouldnt look right
charlie picks up a copy of henry james portrait of a lady and tries to read it
he tosses it aside
a paper on that one too
but dont worry about that now
the hemmingway one is first
it was nothing
im almost finished
take your time
i dont care
i know you dont
youve been very preoccupied lately
thats the word
charlie turns towards teresa and tries to kiss her
she playfully turns away
but charlie quickly gets bored with that and doesnt pursue her
she is confused by his actions
lets go back inside
charlie and teresa already farther up the beach walking
they notice a very beautiful house with limousines parked in front of it
know who lives there
the name george earhardt mean anything to you
he lives there
of course he lives there
would i point it out to you if he didnt
the house is seen from a great distance
there is great activity
all with a very businesslike air
youre intolerable today
watch your language
they arrive at the cottage
charlie and teresa are coming in putting down the books and papers
i like it here
she caresses charlie
he is still preoccupied
im going to take that apartment uptown
probably a good idea
why dont you do it this time
you know why
with my parents
well you cant blame them in a way
pulling away from him i can take care of myself
you know that
charlies father is the patient in the bed
the visitors surrounding the bed are charlies mother teresa and teresas mother
the camera moves in closer as we hear the sounds of mechanical voices coming from the t
sets in the lobby
teresas mother leans over and whispers into charlies fathers ear
thats your boy charles
dont you know him
isnt that charles
there is no answer
charlie is embarrassed
teresas mother asks again
who is that
charlie doesnt know how to react
teresas mother looks up with a half smile in disbelief
the other visitors give off a small ripple of nervous laughter repeating it
charlie looks about nervously
through the door of the hospital room can be seen several of the older patients gathered around a t
in the hallway
they are watching the races the announcers voice is blaring almost incomprehensibly
teresa and charlie make love
charlie is getting dressed
teresa is wrapped warmly in the sheets still in bed
he must have heard the name from those t
s in the hall that were blaring all the time
i remember guevara was in town at the time
mustve heard it from there i guess
but thats funny isnt it
of all people
now say the truth
do i look like che guevara
he crosses to teresa and they kiss
youve been running round too much
bet youve been forgetting your medicine
the green capsules in the top drawer
charlie gets her the pills and heads out of the cottage for a walk
charlie is walking along the roadway and looking at the different cottages
he is carrying a notebook to which he periodically refers
he stops in front of a luxurious cottage and checks the address on the signpost with the one in his notebook beside which is listed the name groppi
he remains standing at a safe distance from the cottage staring at it
it looks deserted
charlie walks directly to the front door of the cottage and rings the bell confidently
the door is opened immediately which startles him
from inside the house we see groppis back as he holds the door open
he is in a satin robe
we can see charlies startled face through the partially opened door
what do you want kid
at that moment a nude girl her back to the camera appears in the foreground
this startles charlie even more
what do you want
im selling encyclopedias
er a magazines
im conducting a survey
we dont want no fuckin books
groppi slams the door in charlies face
charlie is still standing in front of the cottage
suddenly a little boy of about nine appears
theres nobody here mister
charlie turns in surprise
isnt this jack groppis place
but he aint here now
know where he is
the boy leads him towards a heavily overgrown treed area
how much farther
charlie repeats this question periodically as he follows the boy
finally charlie finds himself alone in the middle of a dense forest with the boy nowhere in sight
he calls out but there is no answer
he realizes hes been had
now dont get excited
charlie is trying to find his way out of the forest
the stone which the builders reject will become the cornerstone
a loud brass band is playing oh johnny oh johnny how you can love inside the cafe
they are part of a religious festival and giovanni has invited them in for drinks
in return they are playing for him
giovanni has been drinking
the song ends
play it again
everyone laughs and joins in
one more time
play it again
the band begins the song for the second time
charlie enters the cafe and goes directly to his uncle who embraces him
over the music take a drink
charlie sits next to his uncle and looks around at the crowd in the cafe which is now singing along with the band
giovanni is smiling broadly
loud applause follow the end of the song and the band tries clumsily to make its way through the crowd and out of the cafe
hey where you been
you heard what happened to groppi eh
charlie gets very nervous at the mention of groppis name
no i dont know not me
all i know is
cuts charlie off with a gesture of his forefinger our friend groppi went to his mothers house
and when he was there
an old woman is sitting in front of the television watching continues in voice over he walks into his mothers room where shes watching television
and he says to her
groppi has entered the room with his back to the camera
that hes sorry
groppi leaves the frame
the old woman looks up from the television
its all right
we see groppi walking towards the bathroom
voice over continued he goes in the next room
groppi turns on the bathroom light
voice over continued he takes a gun and puts it in his mouth and
groppi stands with the gun in his hand
he lifts it to his head
he puts the barrel into his mouth
he pulls the trigger
with an italian hand gesture so
charlie is visibly shocked
how do you like that eh
he was always a little crazy yknow
a little crazy
charlie looks up to see michael standing at the entrance of the cafe
he waves to charlie in a friendly manner
charlie waves back and giovanni looks up squinting to see who it is
michael does not approach the table
in respect to giovanni he signals to charlie that he would like to see him outside
in a few minutes
michael is surprised at being spoken to in such a curt manner especially in giovannis presence because he feels he has lost status
charlie and giovanni continue their conversation
i gave him all the breaks i can give
oh michael look
this punk bastard
i call him at work
i say johnny boy there
he doesnt even show up for work anymore
ive talked to him and ive talked to him
what more can i do
tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head
but understand i dont like being taken advantage of
i mean youre in there talking with your uncle and all
this is embarassing
well settle it tonight
two young boys about years old walk up to charlie
hey you sell firecrackers
you know where we can get some
sure see that guy over there
he points to michael
hes got the best
the boys go over to michael
you sell firecrackers
he looks around yknow thats illegal
well the guy over there said

michael goes to tony who has been standing in front of the cafe with a group of boys
they talk for a minute and go back to the waiting boys
to the boys cmon

the four of them get into tonys car
they drive to ok you guys get out and wait here for me

the car pulls away

the car pulls up at tonys place
tony yells to charlie who is standing outside
charlie gets in
just stiffed those kids
dont wantem comin back and findin you
start asking you questions
lets go to the movies
have a heart
this is my business
the boys are paying for their tickets
donovans reef is showing
we see a brief scene from the film which has john wayne fighting lee marvin in a big bar room brawl
the boys smile and watch
the two boys from riverdale are still watching on the corner in the dark
charlie is at home shaving
you know damn well whats going to happen tonight
ill probably get drunk at that party
it isnt every day you send one of your best friends off to war for god and country
gotta have a party
i mean hes a nice kid
charlie is gluing on a fake beard
i dont know what you think of him but thats between you and him anyway
i cant help feeling sorry for him though
has a talent but doesnt use it
an unprofitable servant who shall be cast forth into the darkness outside where there will be
television image of old women mourning their dead in india
the images are slow motion
the news continues with more trivial news images
washington investigations demonstrations etc
continued voice over the weeping and the gnashing of teeth
or something like that
my talents my brain too but i use my talent
im not saying that im a genius
youll probably be the first one to agree on that but i can tell the difference between the intelligent and the stupid
take the army for example
charlie grabbing a white robe off his bed
we dont see his face
continued voice over thats there and im here and thats the way its going to stay
tony enters the bathroom turns on the light and locks the door
party noises can be heard in the background tony is wearing an overcoat and is dressed as a world war i dough boy
atop his head is a mask the features of which cant be seen
he opens the coat to reveal twenty packets of red jello
he turns on the hot water in the bathtub and slowly begins to empty each packet of jello into the tub of steaming water
most of the characters that were at the club the other night are present at the party
many of them are dressed in semi masquerade outfits
some are wearing soldiers uniforms
one wears a sheet made up to be a roman toga
the girls are in costumes also
all of the costumes are makeshift
michael is made up as dracula sporting a large cape semi tuxedo type suit and a drop of blood on the corner of his mouth
his hair is slicked back to give him a bela lugosi look
he is showing a picture of a girl to one of the boys proudly proclaiming that she is his latest conquest
tony comes out of the bathroom and passes by
he takes the photo from michael
group attention focuses on tony now
he stares at the picture holds it away from him then closer to his face then sideways and finally upside down
i know her michael
in fact i saw her a few days ago under a bridge in jersey making out with a nigger
michael grimaces in shock
and i kissed her
he wipes his lips with his cape
the guest of honor the young soldier is very drunk
he is attempting to open his going away presents one of which turns out to be a carefully folded american flag
he attempts to open it with one great flourish
he fails however knocking over the glasses on the table
the group applauds
suddenly the doorbell rings and everyone looks up
the door opens and charlie appears arms outstretched dressed as the ressurected christ with white robes fake beard and hair and artificial wounds
his arms stretch out wider
the initial shock wears off and tony greets him
charlie enters in mock holiness
i have come to create order
scotch and water please
they all laugh
the rock music blares as charlie walks to and fro blessing all in the room
tony is delighted with the scene
charlie sits at the kitchen table tony opposite him and the others gather around
the party is getting noisier
tony gives charlie a glass of ice cubes
charlie plays the part of a priest during the mass when the chalice is filled with wine and water tony pours the scotch over his fingers first
charlie lifts his hands to touch the bottle as a priest would
he signifies that there is enough in the glass
tony then repeats the same ritual with a bottle of soda water
may god be with you
and with your spirit
gesturing with his drink salute
everyone drinks after repeating the toast
the crowd around them begins to break up as charlie and tony begin to have fun with each other
tony pulls down his mask revealing a skeleton death face which covers his own face except for his mouth
it completes the dough boy uniform quite well
taking on the guise of an interviewer art thou the king of the jews
dost thou say this of thyself or have others told thee of me
am i a jew
thy own people and the chief priests have delivered thee to me
what hast thou done
michael and a few of the others gather around again as they continue
my kingdom is not of this world
if my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that i might not be delivered to the jews
but as it is my kingdom is not from here
thou art then a king
thou sayest it i am a king
this is why i was born and why i have come into this world to bear witness to the truth
everyone who is of the truth hears my voice
tony leans over towards charlie
what is the truth
the others around them give mock applause
tony smiles and nods his head to them
someone hits charlie on the back of the head
charlie startled looks up
prophesy to us oh christ
who is it that struck thee
i dont know but god help him if he does it again
they all laugh
charlie is talking to michael
the conversation is serious
charlie has not lost his sense of humor
he said hed be here
well he isnt
hell be here
look take this for now
he hands michael a twenty dollar bill from under his robe
the way it is now this isnt even interest for two hours
putting the bill back into his pocket how much was the original loan again
he borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans
now counting the interest
can we hold it at
charlie this is business
avoiding the issue but i say to you love your enemies do good to those who hate you and pray for those who persecute
ill tell you who you can pray for
next payday ill be at tonys place
johnny better show or i find him and break his legs
and i mean it
in the same manner but i say to you not to resist the evildoer on the contrary if someone takes thy tunic let him take thy cloak as well
to him who asks of thee give and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away
he could at least show some respect and show his face even if he doesnt have the money
more serious now amen i say to thee thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny
you said it
a loud scream is heard from the bathroom
someone shoved a nude girl into the bathtub which is now filled with congealed red jello
the boys are laughing and shoving each other about roughly
charlie comes out of the next room and walks along in a christ like manner through the madness his arms outstretched
one boy kneels and kisses the hem of his robe and charlie blesses him
there is a great deal of pushing and shoving going on inside the bathroom and near the doorway
charlie promises to save the sinner as he pushes his way through
he helps the girl remove the jello from her body and helps her out of the bathtub
it is obvious that she is quite stoned
she caresses him and they find themselves kissing
the others storm into the bathroom and grab charlie
the anti christ
they drag charlie into the next room where amidst all the shouting and laughing the other members of the party are placing firecrackers on model airplanes simulating their own dog
they are flying the planes out the open window
charlie takes everything in stride trying to shout a few lines over their laughter
for they know not
what they do
the doorbell rings and tony answers it
it is teresa and she looks very worried
charlie and teresa dash from a tenement doorway
charlie is still in beard and wig but his robes are open so they give the effect of being a bulky overcoat
the building on the corner
hes been on the roof a half hour now
now dont get excited
dont get excited
it is very late and the streets are deserted
at the corner of the building in question a few of johnny boys friends cling to the wall for safety
when they see charlie and teresa they call out
charlie stay there
hes got a
teresa gets up against a wall
charlie sends her down the block and she leaves reluctantly
johnny its me charlie
johnny boy can now be seen silhouetted against the moonlight on the tenement roof
he has a gun in his hand
dont come any closer
cut it out stupid
johnny boy fires a shot into the air
charlie clings to the wall with the others
a moment later he makes a quick run for the doorway of the building across the street
he enters the building that leads to the roof
charlie has reached the roof
he laughs with glee
what are you
he slaps johnny boy on the back of the head
dont do that
im only scaring them
you get your cousin half sick over this
the boys below are still clinging to the walls of the building
johnny is oblivious to charlies statement
he takes out a home made firecracker consisting of glass cigar tubing filled with gunpowder and a waxed fuse stick through the top layer of cork
he lights it
what the fuck
johnny boy tosses it over the building and it blows up in mid air
the boys below rush madly away
lights go on in the tenements around them
the explosion was quite loud
lets get out of here
did you see them run
charlie and johnny boy are sneaking over a fence in an old cemetary which is part of their neighborhood
it surrounds their church and dates back to the beginning of the th century
no one is buried there any longer
it is very quiet and dark
they sit and rest
charlie is still in his makeup
i swear to god charlie
my arm still hurts from the car accident
thats why i didnt go to work
i swear it
thats not going to help
im going to work this week
i mean it
its impossible for you to catch up on the loan now
the interest is going up
do you realize that flash
im sorry charlie
i didnt mean it
in the meantime its done
ill still try to help you out
you know that
but you gotta show some effort
charlie you know the best way to take care of this whole mess
if you had a little talk with your uncle
if anybody can do it he can
thatll help you out fine
thats the best way for you not for me
i swear to god ill rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this
i dont care what happens he doesnt find out
i dont get involved with anything you understand that
im clean as far as you know
yeah take it easy
will you relax
thats what i get for getting involved
look on pay day at least show up at tonys place to meet him ok
this way he doesnt think that youre trying to screw him
if you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and hell take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something
im not asking im telling you
johnny boy closes his eyes
charlie looks at johnny boy and then looks at the cemetary in the moonlight
it seems totally apart from the city with the sirens and cars far in the distance
charlie stands and unravels his robes preparing to take them off
he projects the image of christ delivering a sermon
music and laughter in the distance catches his attention
the lights and the music are coming from the top floor of a tenement building where a puerto rican family is having a party
the sound echoes through the streets
decorations are hanging and blowing away through the open windows
as charlie watches a fight break out over one of the girls
screams are heard
people run up and down the fire escape
charlie has pulled off the robe
he now removes the beard and wig and has become himself again
he leans over to find johnny boy fast asleep on a tomb
could you not then watch one hour with me
he wakes johnny boy up
the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak
charlie is sitting in the corner
the restaurant is in the same condition that it was the last time he was there
while charlie waits for his uncle in his semi private corner a handful of old mafiosi invited by giovanni sit at another table
giovanni enters with mario
the old mafiosi are greeted first
they rise and kiss giovanni on the cheek
charlie is very impressed at their respectful showing
the waitresses and everyone else in the club treat them all like royalty
oscar approaches the table where charlie giovanni and mario are seated and greets them warmly
put the menus away
i personally do the cooking tonight
thats why im here
anything you want
can i talk
refering to charlie
giovanni nods his head yes
about the place giovanni
i know all about it
well discuss it later
our arrangements about the place havent changed have they
no no not at all
look we leave it the way it is for now we talk later understand
ill bring the clams now
charlie is visible awed by giovanni and marios confidence and power
he is behaving as if he were at a job interview
charlie had often had dinner with his uncle but this time the conversation is more pointed
their conversation is mostly in italian with english titles
they are discusssing groppis suicide
i really couldnt believe it when you told me you know that
well he was always a little crazy
he puts a gun in his mouth
like your friend
comme si chiama
i was more upset about that than about groppi thats for sure
laughing to mario you know this boy over here once long time ago tried to enrich my mind
so he gives me a book by this hemin fella
to read so i read it
wasnt a book
was a short story
what was it
yknow i read
short happy life of francis macomber
didnt read it but i saw the movie
yeh mario over here he reads a lot
i like this harold robbins
oh yes hes pretty good
what i dont understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that youre gonna read anyway
its only a couple of courses
just for the draft
charlie couple of courses isnt enough to get you student deferred
i mean if they wanted to draft you you wouldve been drafted by now
charlie feels that it would be better not to pursue the point
what marios trying to tell you charlie is that youre wasting your time with those couple of courses
you dont need them
there are a lot of things that can be taken care of
you know what i mean
they all laugh
they become aware of the t
set which is on in the rear of the back room where they are dining
the news is on
politics society and war
they talk nice
charlie listen attentively but obviously has heard giovannis philosophy before
but its the same thing all the same
theyre in there by having something on somebody
and when that doesnt work
our life has honor
we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do
they know where to come when they need us
i realize this during the war
world war ii
during wwii he worked with the government taking care of the docks
what did he do
what did he do
he was there
thats what he did
in the fifties when the communists started in with this country and they tried to clean them out we offered to do it for them
but they didnt want us to
so we kept out of it
i told this
the same thing to your father thirty years ago
i told him what to do
but he didnt listen
the conversation turns to more direct topics while they have their coffee and ainsette
youre still around with that kid johnny boy
last night with that gun
dont get mixed up with them
this johnny boy you know hes named after me
this johnny boy is like your mister groppi
a little crazy
its nice you should help him out because of his family and our family but watch yourself
dont spoil anything
charlie nods feeling very uneasy
his whole family has problems
his cousin the girl who lives next door to you
the one whos sick right
in the head
no shes got epilepsy
thats what i said sick in the head
her mother and father come to me and ask advice
she wants to leave
get her own apartment
worries them sick
what am i gonna tell them
lock her up
what do they expect you to say
its not hard to figure out what shell wind up like
when the respect for parents breaks down thats bad
you know im cumpari with them
so i take an interest
you live next door keep an eye open
but dont get involved
why dont you take a look around the place if you want
oh thats ok
ive been in and out of this place fifty times
well maybe you missed something
oh yeah thats a possibility
charlie heads for the kitchen
things look good if i may say so myself
dont you agree
unless theres something you know that i dont know
charlie is examining the kitchen closely
a black cook is working hard taking a piece of meat off the grill
he carefully prepares a dish
charlie smiles and moves in closer to the grill
the cook is sweating and mopping his brow
man its hot as hell in here every day like going through hell in here
charlie moves in closer and the cook continues preparing the food
hot as hell
youre not the only one going through hell kid
but at this pay it aint worth it
that much i can tell you
charlie hasnt been listening to the cook
he has become fascinated with the flames on the grill
they remind him of an old device from his catholic school days
charlie brings his hand forward and closer to the fire testing the pain of the fires of hell
if thy hand is an occasion of sin to thee cut it off
it is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell into the unquenchable fire
where their worm dies not and the fire is not quenched
charlies hand touches the flame
charlie johnny tony and jimmy are driving along in tonys car
as they talk a derelict takes advantage of a red light to wipe their windshield
tony rolls up the window and rolls the car forward a bit to force the derelict out of the way
is it near sullivan street
no by bedford
oh you gotta show me
i always get lost in the village
next time bet with your own kind

joey looks at johnny boy but decides to let it pass
charlie gives johnny boy a dirty look
music is playing on a juke box
several girls stand nearby listening to both the music and the discussion
johnny boy looks over at them and then at joey
lower the fuckin music i cant hear nothin
the girls like it loud

joey his friends and the girls all look up

charlie can no longer control the situation as tempers rise
you cant call me a mook
jimmy swings at joey
a fight breaks out
jimmy charlie tony and johnny boy are beaten
charlie not badly hurt manages to calm everything down
the police arrive to break up the fight
people look iin as the two cops walk into the bar
the boys stop fighting immediately as they see the cops
in fact they treat charlie and the others as friends helping them up off the floor dusting off the clothes etc
the police search everyone
when they ask who started it what happened etc
everybody including charlie and the others cover for everyone else
it was a joke officer hes my cousin we were just kidding etc
the cops nod
play nice now and leave
everyone apologizes to each other
they drink again
johnny boy doesnt say a word just stares

they drink again
joey gives jimmy the money jimmy goes to count it

hey cmon no bullshit friends
joey extends his hand
jimmy and charlie shake
joey extends his hand to johnny

charlie and the others oh no

he is interrupted by a flying fist
the fight breaks out anew
they barely make it to the door
jimmy is out first with his cash
they run down the street
the west side boys dont chase them but stand by their bar shouting after them
johnny is laughing as he runs
charlie yells at him
you got some mouth
johnny youre a real jerk off

they reach the car
tony heads in first behind the wheel
about to take off fuck youse all
the others jump in
you got no honor tony
the car starts off
garbage and garbage pails are tosses after them as the boys take off
the lead guitarist holds his guitar out like a machine gun and strums frantically on it swinging it back and forth at the audience and then at the rest of
as he does so the rest of the group falls dead over their instruments
the number is over and they all get up
the place is empty except for charlie tony and a few others all of whom have been listening to the band
charlie is talking to the leader of the group
no really i liked it

charlie can see the negro stripper diane down the hall in her dressing room
she is putting on her makeup
charlie is still very attracted to her
he enters her room
diane how are you feeling
as charlie continues to talk to her she undresses and begins to get into her first costume
charlie feels slightly uncomfortable

she is undressing aside from all that joking around we do out there
when youre on

no im serious

charlie bumps into michael and a friend as he is leaving

michael is sarcastic
he points to the parked car in front of him
i tell you charlie
if that kid doesnt show up tonight
michaels plan is seen on the screen as he speaks
im gonna find him drag him down here tie one of his legs to that ford bumper over here
johnny boy is dragged to the car and michaels friend ties his leg to the car
and his other leg to that chrysler over there
johnny boys other leg is tied to the chrysler
we see a close up of a foot slamming down on the gas pedal twice
one car heads for the west side the other to the east side
tires screech and exhaust fumes fill the air
all three laugh
look michael ill get him here
what do you want me to do kill him
charlie is on the phone trying to locate johnny boy
teresa is pacing back and forth nervously in the background
charlie hangs up
are you sure he didnt say anything to you about tonight
for gods sakes
i told you before
she moves closer charlie i cant stay in here too long at this hour
will you please listen to me
charlie turns and smiles at her
he kisses her because he doesnt feel like listening
teresa is too preoccupied to respond
johnny boy walking through greenwich village looking around as if being chased
charlie is kissing teresa who is still very upset
its uptown and its perfect
its big enough for two people
shes going to get out by the end of the month
if you dont act right away itll go in no time
what do you think
johnny boy is making his way back to the apartment by sneaking along the sides of the buildings in the darkened street
charlie tries to make love to teresa out of his nervous energy and impatience at waiting so long for johnny boy
teresa is rejecting his attempts
johnny boy imagines he is being followed and dashes into the door of a nearby building and up the stairs
charlie is doubly frustrated by teresas rejection of his attempts at lovemaking because of his concern for johnny boy
he becomes sarcastic and abrupt
dont you realize what that apartment means
charlie doesnt answer
for both of us
after a while you might even be able to move in yourself
teresa is visibly shaken but charlie cannot be bothered
are you serious
me move in with you
johnny boy is silhouetted against the moonlight
he makes his way quietly over the roofs of the tenements and climbs down charlies fire escape
teresa get these ideas out of your head
ive got enough on my hands right now
with that bastard cousin of yours
you wanna move
by all means
but keep me out of it
ive got nothing to do with it
johnny boy is at charlies window
through it he can see teresa lying on the bed in tears and charlie pacing back and forth across the room
he is still talking loudly johnny boy doesnt seem to pay any attention to the fact that teresa is in charlies bedroom
he opens the window and jumps in smiling sarcastically
teresa and charlie are startled
charlie grabs johnny boy by his coat collar
where were you
answer me you sonofabitch
where were you
teresa is frightened and rushes towards charlie
johnny boy reacts to the scene with uncontrolled laughter
charlie is outraged and slaps him across the face but johnny continues to laugh
yeah teresa shut up
we dont wanna get charlie here in trouble do we
we love charlie
charlie flings johnny boy against a wardrobe letting go of his collar
you had me going crazy
teresa is crying
johnny goes into the kitchen and charlie follows
teresa stays in the doorway
johnny boy takes a drink of water from the sink as he talks
charlie is calmer now calm enough to realize that johnny has figured out his true relationship to teresa
he tries to protect himself
your cousin here was getting sick worrying about you
weve been in here calling
oh thats too bad teresa
charlie is embarrassed and teresa is afraid
have the bans been announced yet
dont be smart
im not smart
im stupid remember
im so stupid that you have to look out for me remember
teresa is crying
dont be upset teresa
you have to understand charlie here
he gives of himself to help others
im going to go home
no you stay
johnny i swear to god if you open your mouth about any of this
i wouldnt say a word to my aunt and uncle
or even your uncle charlie
teresa makes it to the door and opens it quickly
johnny boy grabs her to keep her from leaving
charlie rushes towards them and pulls johnny boy away
by now they are halfway down the hall
i always wondered about her
what happens when she comes
does she get one of those fits
that would be something to see
johnny boy is interrupted by charlies fist as it lands a solid punch on the right side of his hand
teresa screams and rushes to separate them
you rat bastard
dont hit me again
i think i will fuckin go see your uncle right now
hed be interested
charlie rushes johnny boy towards the stairs
they bump into teresa slamming her against the wall
and well see what happens to you without me
teresa is terrified that johnny boy will really go to charlies uncle
teresa falls hitting the stairs with a thud
she lies there moaning and tossing her head
charlie and johnny boy go to help her
what do i do
you know anything about this
johnny boy steps over teresa to go down the stairs
i dont know
shes your girl
i gotta go
charlie is furious
johnny boy points to teresa who is getting worse
hate to miss the floor show though
charlie lunges out at johnny boy shoving him halfway down the stairs
he has gotten hold of his coat so that johnny boy cant leave
neighbors from downstairs open their doors and come up the stairs
charlie in complete panic tries to put something into teresas mouth while holding johnny boy at the same time
he shoves his hand into her mouth trying to pry it open but she bites into it
charlie screams as the blood streams out
he lets go of johnny boy
the neighbors take over
one woman appears to know how to administer aid to teresa
johnny boy is halfway down the stairs by now
the neighbor takes care of teresa
while charlie dashes down the stairs charlie grabs johnny in the ground floor hallway
in the deserted factory section of manhattan johnny boy and charlie stand next to a corregated metal garage door
charlie smashes johnny boy against the door sending resounding echoes into the street
you crazy bastard
what are you trying to do ruin me
johnny boy is not fighting back anymore
he is on the verge of tears
charlie smashes him against the door again again the crashing sound reverberates in the empty street
again johnny boy is thrown up against the door
you threaten me with my uncle
after what im doing for you
what youre doing for me isnt worth it
charlie slaps johnny boy and pushes him against the door again
then dont show up tonight and see what happens
he digs his hands into johnnys pockets but he cant find anything
how much have you got for michael tonight
i only got eight bucks on me
charlie stares at johnny boy for a moment then puts his hand into his own pocket and pulls out three ten dollar bills and three ones
here take twenty bucks
with your eight that makes twenty eight bucks you give michael
i keep the thirteen for the weekend
maybe well eat some chinese food later
johnny boy doesnt take it
charlie forces it into his hand
im doing it for you stupid
no youre not
charlie calmer now is feeling ashamed
oh cut it out will ya
charlie twenty eight bucks is nothing
the only way to do it is through your uncle
think about it will you
what do you think i am crazy
no i just want to help myself thats all
he tugs johnny boy along
youre over an hour late
michael said hell be back later though
charlie takes a drink
johnny boy sits at the bar
the place is beginning to empty and the show is over
charlie takes tony aside
watch this kid for me
i have to go someplace but ill be back soon to get michael and him together
dont even let him go to the bathroom
he turns to johnny boy
dont you move
ill be here
johnny orders a drink
charlie gets into the cab
th avenue and waverly place fast please
the cab takes off
they soon arrive at their destination
where do you want me to stop
charlie leans back into the seat and peeks out the window
just pass real slow ok
charlie looks out the window and sees diane the negro stripper
she is standing on the corner waiting for him
charlie nods his head for the driver to stop
what am i
take me back to where you picked me up
the car drives away passing diane who is on the corner
charlie is back inside the club
back so soon
mind your own business
tony sets up drinks for them and pours them into shot glasses
charlie strikes a match and lights each glass
little blue flames dance along the rims of the glasses
hey cut it out
he blows out the flames
charlie moves to the other and of the room with his drink
you can see things arent going too well for me at the moment
my willpower and powers of persuasion are not what they usually are today
my ability to control events and situations are wanting
what can i say
i offer this as part of my penance
a young couple two of the few people left in the place are having a hushed quarrel at the end of the bar
the boy leaves for the mens room
whos the girl
how do you know
look at her
she dont look jewish
sure she is
shes always in here with some different guy
you know the way they are
charlie approaches the girl
i love you
the girl looks at him first embarrassed then annoyed
ever since that first day i saw you at the convent with the nuns playing volleyball i couldnt help myself
you dont look it
the girl laughs
her boyfriend comes out of the mens room
he has her coat in his hand
to the boy fuck off
what do you mean
he looks at charlie lets go
charlie reaches over and grabs the girls arm tightly
she looks up startled and the boy appears to be frightened
its obvious that the girl doesnt want to accompany you isnt it
this is private
the girl is really scared now
id like to leave
charlie wont let go of her arm
she tries to pull away but his grip tightens
whether she wants to or not
shes not going
let go of her
the girl is in tears
youre hurting me
take her away from me
i mean physically take her away from me
he is holding her so tightly that she is doubling over in pain
the boy although he is scared lunges at charlie
there is a brief scuffle which tony breaks up
johnny boy is lifting the lid of a garbage pail
he takes out a brown paper bag and opens it
he takes a small
pistol from it and puts it inside his jacket then replaces the bag in the garbage pail
michael has entered the club
the boy and girl are gone
tony is with charlie and johnny boy whose return went unnoticed
whats it gonna be
i was here tonight
you kept me waiting for over an hour
michael has two friends with him
ive got something for you
he has about twenty eight bucks
its all he has on him
better than nothing
johnny boy takes out a ten dollar bill and hands it to him
wheres the rest
yeah wheres the rest
i bought a few rounds of drinks while waiting
charlie is stunned
twenty eight bucks is enough of an insult
i was gonna take the twenty eight bucks because of charlie here
but ten bucks
michael takes the ten dollars crumples it and flings it into johnny boys face
johnny boy picks it up and slowly smooths it out
he sets it on fire as he talks
you make me laugh michael
you know that
ive borrowed money all over the neighborhood and never paid it back
so i couldnt borrow anymore from them
so whos the only jerk off left that i can borrow from without paying back
because thats what i think of you
i fuck you where you breathe
michael lashes out at johnny boy with the back of his hand
johnny boy tosses the flaming bill at michael and quickly pulls out his
everyone is shocked
youre really crazy
youre not going to use that gun johnny
johnny boy doesnt answer but holds the gun straight at michaels face
michael turns to go defying johnny boy
his friends follow
when he reaches the doorway he turns
you dont have the guts to use that
be seeing you charlie tony and of course you john
be seeing you
johnny boy is still frozen with the gun in his hand pointing it at mid air
charlie slams johnny boy across the face with his fist
tony takes the gun from his hand
you stupid bastard
never pull a gun unless you intend to use it
he hits johnny boy again
no bullets in it
charlie hits johnny boy again
get out of here before this really goes up
hide the gun
throw it away
listen i gotta borrow your car
i think we should take a ride
away from here for the night
you know what i mean
but go to a movie first or something
not good to be driving around right away
you know you cant do much for him now
its out of your hands
a young girl is in her room with her maid
the maid is helping her dress
eerie music creates a frightening atmosphere
charlie and johnny boy watch nervously affected by the films mood
the theatre is a nd street one with lots of sleeping drunks
suddenly the maids face begins to contort as if shes seeing something horrible
the audience is on edge
the young girl sees the maid and shouts what is it
but the maid only sneezes
charlie is driving
johnny boy is beside him in the front seat
the top od the car is down and charlie is driving with no particular destination in mind
i think we should see your uncle
this cant be settled any other way now
ill take full blame
what are you going to do
johnny boy turns away and tunes in the radio to a loud rock song
i guess you could safely say that this evening has been so far very unimpressive as far as my efforts are concerned
now id like to know what you do for an encore lord
i know penance is penance but this is something else
johnny boy opens his eyes
what are you talking to yourself
he turns up the radio
play the radio
youre going to a party
lots of fun
a black sedan has been driving along parallel to charlies car unnoticed by charlie
otherwise the street is deserted
the car begins to drive charlie off the road
hey what is this guy crazy
now nows the time
charlie turns his head to look
johnny boy looks up
they fire the gun
a barage of bullets gunshots hit charlies car
charlie is hit in the hand
johnny boy has been hit in the throat
he stands up and leans over the windshield of the car spewing blood onto it and into the wind
he is screaming
the black sedan turns onto another street
charlie is so shocked that the car is completely out of control
it goes screeching along the street swerves and slams into a fire hydrant breaking it off and causing water to shoot out onto the sidewalk car and street
charlie has been thrown from the car
he kneels in the street holding his wrist
he is on the yellow letters fire lane
johnny boy lies against the side of a building still
charlie goes to the curb and sits there holding his bleeding hand
the police arrive with their guns drawn
back in the neighborhood the religious fiesta is ending
the singers on the bandstand are singing the last song of the evening vincino amare
a crowd of elderly italian americans stand below the bandstand and listen
there are four singers their voices projected through a pa system
teresa is in bed asleep
the music can be heard echoing in the background
charlie is still sitting on the curb holding his injured wrist
the ambulance and the police are going about their business
a crowd has gathered
giovanni is watching the late late show on t
car explosion scene from the big heat
aside from the light of the screen the room is darkened
diane is alone sipping coffee
the police are standing around charlie with open notebooks questioning him
he doesnt answer
johnny boys body is being taken into the ambulance
tony is relieving himself
he washes his hands
the last song of the festival is ending now
as the singers come to a stirring climax they wave and shout in italian
the band plays a few bars of home sweet home
the singers throw kisses to the dispursing crowd
people who have been watching the festival pull down the blinds of shades and go in
michaels car is parked in a deserted area on the docks
he has his head in his hands
the boy with him says nothing
charlie is still in shock sitting on the curb
the police are still walking around in a businesslike manner
charlie stares down at his feet
the wrecked car is being pulled away
charlie is being put into an ambulance
he is muttering to himself and seems shocked and bewildered
a door in the far corner of the room opens
charlie is motioned through by a cop who shuts the door immediately behind him
there is an unnaturally loud clanging sound that echoes in the room
charlie looks around still a little dazed and spots mario standing over by the door
mario has made no move to greet him
he just stands there watching
charlie walks over to him sensing something a little ominous
my uncle didnt come
mario says nothing just nods at him to step outside
charlie goes out into the street
there is practically no one on the street
the early morning light makes everything a clammy grey
charlie waits at the bottom of the steps
pauses for a moment giovanni says now he done enough
he got you outta jail
reaching in pocket he wants you outta the way
mario hands charlie an envelope containing an airline ticket
he says use it
dont sell it
he says hell see you
charlie stares at the ticket in his hand
mario is obviously uncomfortable
things worked out rotten kid
he is driving charlie to the airport
a suitcase can be seen in the back seat
trying to be jolly i know i know stupid
i mean where you goin
its an open ticket
i can go anywhere up to
so ill send you a postcard from wherever
if i get there
you flew before
charlies face slightly upset
charlie snapping seat belt in car
stock shot airplane exploding black and white fantasy charlie in car more upset
hey come on
take it easy
i only asked because maybe i could you know let you have a little something
yeah well thanks but i got enough to hold me
my mother can send me some
i dont know
how about teresa
i could talk
trying not to be impatient listen i appreciate it but ill handle it myself
and say what
ill say that im travelling
the twa terminal at kennedy
tonys car pulls up to the curb charlie gets out waves away help from an idle porter and pulls his suitcases out of the back seat
tony leans across the seat toward him
listen try a place with some sun
girls in little french bathing suits
thanks for the ride
charlie breaks away from the handshake and grabs tony affectionately behind the neck
take care of that tiger
no more good times like before
until you come back
and youre gonna take the vows next tuesday right
yeah im gonna worry about you too
tony gives charlies hand a last slap then gets back behind the wheel
charlie nods and watches the car pull away
then he picks up his bag from the sidewalk and walks into the terminal
the place is huge and there is a lot of bustle and excitement
charlie is noticeable because he is the only member of the crowd who walks slowly without any apparent mission or destination
he makes his way toward the large flight board that looms over the whole room
loudspeakers announce planes to and from every part of the world
on the flight board the origins and destinations of the days flight spin and change every moment
he passes the insurance machines and almost stops more upset than before
a businessman calmly pays for insurance
muzak is heard charlie continues on past a novelty shop where some plastic crosses and st
christopher medals hang alongside the stuffed toy dogs and flight bags
he looks at the cross
i dont know what to say to you
the ticket desk is under the flight board
charlie eventually works his way over to the desk drops his bag on the floor and stands staring at the board
he sees the names of dozens of cities flashing before him
as he watches a pretty ticket clerk speaks to him from behind the desk
may i help you
charlie stares at the flight board in dismay and indecision
he apparently does not hear her
sir may i help you
charlie hears her this time
he reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out the ticket which he passes across to her
the clerk starts to open it to check the destination
questioning challenging where can i go
the question is unusual
the clerk looks up
charlie stare back at her with a quality that is almost defiance
