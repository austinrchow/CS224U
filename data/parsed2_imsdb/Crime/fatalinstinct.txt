screenplay by david omalley the sultry dampness of a blistering summer hangs in the night air
people stroll the boardwalk looking for a cool breeze
the soft rhythms of a jazz concert float from the band shell
and a womans shapely legs walking along the wooden pier
after several steps a discarded piece of gum sticks to one of her shoes stretching out stickily
two steps later a piece of paper sticks to the gum flopping awkwardly with each step
the moving camera pans up her gorgeous legs and sensuous body
she wears a loose summer dress that floats like gossamer around her soft curves
her hair is long and blond
to some guys women are like a cheap puzzle
with pieces that just dont fit
they think the soul of a woman is darker than a back alley
more tangled than a telephone cord
and colder than a klondike bar in canada
but those guys dont even have a clue
she stops at the railing
we see an incredibly beautiful face and cool alluring eyes
this is lola cain
the term femme fatale was coined for her
shes on display
and knows it
when you know women the way i do you understand exactly what what makes them tick
what makes them hum
what makes them jiggle up and down when they walk
and its not the kind of thing you can learn from a correspondence course
the camera moves with her as she walks on passing two men whose eyes are glued to her
we hold on them
one is ned ravine in his thirties stalwart handsome hair trimmed neatly but with a feel of loose ends about him
coat slung over his shoulder sleeves rolled up the sweat dampening his shirt
hes a cop
a plain clothes detective whos been around the block a few times and still gets lost
next to him is arch his partner
older if not in years at least in mileage
dependable solid with no great aspirations except to reach the end of a shift intact
hes eating nachos from a cardboard container licking the cheese off his fingers
the camera pushes in to ned
his eyes are fixed on lola
she walks to the other side of the pier
as more paper sticks to the gum on her shoe
she stands at the railing
there are two kinds of women in this world
and ive known em both
arch heaves an exasperated sigh and looks toward ned
the camera pulls back to include ned
it isnt voice over narration at all
ned is actually talking out loud
one will take you for a fast ride on a bumpy road with no seat belt
but the other kind
knock off the chatter will ya
just trying to keep you awake arch
where do you come up with all that crap about women
women are very complex but if you know how to read em
theyre an open book
you can always tell the rotten apples from the peaches
are you kiddin
id stake my career on it
anybody ever proves me wrong ill throw away my badge
women are trouble
i used to believe that too
until i married lana
is a peach
yeah well youre a lucky stiff pal
ya hold down two jobs
got a beautiful wife waitin for ya at home
everything a guy could ever want including no kids
id love to have kids
give me a break
looks around jeez i hate stakeouts
what makes you think milos gonna show up here
he knocked off all those banks
hes got cash
hes gonna want to spend it
this is one of the few places that still takes cash
sooner or later
hes gotta turn up
and how we sposed to recognize this scumbag
the support hose bandit
when you see him
youll know him
in the b
milo crumley the support hose bandit ambles by casually unnoticed sucking on a cherry snow cone through the panty hose pulled down over his head
these are the best damn nachos in north america
maybe the world
he pops the last chip in his mouth licks his fingers and turns the container over
im gonna get a refill
you want some
ned shakes his head
arch heads off to the nacho stand
ned steps over to the railing
gazes out at the ocean
a saxophone begins to wail a scorching romantic melody
a recurrent tune that will come to be known as lolas theme
a beat later
lola moves to neds side at the railing
he tries to ignore her presence peering into the darkness
lola digs in her purse for a pack of cigarettes
got a light
ned pulls out a small flashlight shines it in her purse
she pulls a cigarette out of the pack puts it to her lips
her eyes on ned sizing him up
how about a match
i have plenty
he pulls out a handful of matchbooks shows her then stuffs them back in his pocket
he turns and walks along the pier
she falls into step beside him lighting her own cigarette
a saxophone player named dizzy follows behind them continuing to play
hes the actual source of the romantic theme music weve been hearing
you really are incredibly stupid arent you
i like that in a man
id be insulted but i know youre serious
you sound so sure of yourself
im not as dumb as i look
let me buy you a drink mr
and you are
what about that drink
im on duty
and i bet you have a big gun
lola looks toward a nearby hot dog vendor
if i cant buy you a drink
nods toward vendor let me buy you one of those
who can say no to a weiner
lola turns to the hot dog vendor raising two fingers
she takes them
hands one to ned
he picks up the plastic mustard container to put mustard on her hot dog first
you come here often
only when im in heat
ned reacts to this squeezing the container
a stream of mustard squirts out hitting the front of lolas dress
flustered he stuffs his hot dog into his inside jacket pocket then tries to wipe the mustard off lolas dress smearing it all over her making it worse
she watches him with a cool detached gaze as he fumbles ingenuously
suddenly ned stops looking off
milo crumley going into the public restroom
ned starts to leave
lola grabs his hand holding it tightly against her breast
where ya going
get something to wipe it off
youre doing just fine
ill get you a wet paper towel
he heads for the mens room
signaling to arch whos waiting in line at the nacho stand
arch motions at the long line
all uniformed cops
several men are at the urinals
milo still wearing the panty hose over his head washes his face at the sink
he looks up sees ned enter
ned sees milo
reacts pulling the frankfurter out of his pocket and pointing it
hold it right there milo
the men turn seeing ned pointing the frankfurter
hes got a weenie
milo bolts slamming into ned knocking him back through the door of a stall into the lap of the man inside
milo bursts out colliding with arch
they both go down in a flurry of nacho chips and cheese
arch helps milo to his feet apologizing profusely
picking up the gun that milo dropped handing it back to him
milo sprints off down the pier
a beat later ned bursts out the door
dashing after milo
milo runs frantically knocking people aside
he ducks into
and drags a flustered man out of a bumper car jumps in and speeds away
a beat later ned runs up followed by arch
ned flashes his badge at a freckle faced kid in one of the bumper cars
i need your car
he pulls the kid out jumps in slaps a portable flashing red light on the dashboard
then speeds off after milo a siren wailing
he zig zags through the crush of other bumper cars in the pavilion
neds bumper car catches up with milo pulling alongside
milo turns the wheel ramming ned
ned rams him back both bumper cars swerving violently
ned slams milos car again
milo loses control spins out and smashes into the pavillion railing
ned swerves to avoid a collision but rams into two other bumper cars wrenching to a grinding halt
the airbag inflates in his bumper car
arch runs up as ned pulls himself from the wreckage
they turn to see milo leap from his mangled bumper car leap over the pavillion railing and dash down the pier and into an alley between two buildings
a sign on the building says ned and arch eye each other shake their heads and follow after milo
sequence omitted from original script
milo runs into a tall chain link fence at the end of the alley and scrambles up the wire mesh
suddenly neds hand shoots out grabs milos ankle yanking him down hard
milo jumps to his feet swinging at ned who catches milos fist with his hand stopping it cold
neatly snapping a handcuff on his wrist
he shoves milos arm against the fence and snaps the other cuff to the chainlink
a switchblade flashes out of milos other hand with a sharp click
milo slashes the blade at ned just missing his face
on the backswing ned parries with his own switchblade and flips milos knife away
milo pulls a
calibre revolver with his free hand
ned shoves his finger into the end of the barrel
milo looks surprised
then sneers clicking the hammer back
you take science in high school milo
i skipped high school cop
then youre probably not familiar with the theory of inverse proportionate explosive dynamics
what about it
if you fire a weapon with the barrel obstructed the explosive force multiplies by twenty three point five nine eight and reverses on itself with diametric polarity
the gun will blow up in your hand
and it wont even scorch my pinkie
thats just theoretical hypothesis
inverse proportionate explosive dynamics has never been demonstrated conclusively in a laboratory environment
then pull the trigger smart guy
lets find out
milo hesitates unsure
finally he releases the gun
ned raises it up on the end of his finger
arch pulls it off with a loud pop
ned cuffs milos hands behind him
spins him around
you have the right to remain silent
if you waive that right anything you say
holding up a series of cue cards
as ned reads from them
may be used against you in a court of law
you have the right to an attorney
do you have an attorney
then todays your lucky day
he flips out a business card handing it to milo
ned ravine defense attorney large
the name on the mailbox reads ned and lana ravine
we begin to hear the o
sound of passionate lovemaking
sequence omitted from original script
the camera moves up the stairs into the bedroom
we hear more heavy breathing
a trail of clothes is scattered before us on the way to the bed
shoes a dress slip bra nylons panties
greasy coveralls with a frank kelbo mobile mechanic namepatch dirty work boots a wrench and a gigantic grease gun
the bed shakes violently
a female voice calls the shots as various tools drop to the floor
oh yes frank
adjust the stroke by ten percent
a wrench now tweak my points
oh yes oh yes
pliers you got it
stabilize your ball joints and grind my rear differential
screwdriver now accelerate
lay rubber baby
the light clicks on
lana a sexy redhead with a cool manipulative edge and frank a slick smarmy lothario lay under the sheets panting glistening with sweat
lana reaches for a pack of fatal s on the bedside table
not bad for an auto mechanic
grins cocky yeah well youre not so bad yourself
for a lawyers wife
better watch your tongue sweetie or ill have my husband arrest you
cop and a lawyer
when does he ever find time for you
she lights a cigarette
exhales a soft gloomy cloud
thats why i need you to keep my engine tuned frank
why drive a jalopy when you can have a hot rod
maybe you should trade him in on a new model
if i could make any money on the deal
reaches for her want to go for another test drive
the sound of an automobile engine outside
lana stops him
pull over and park it frank
im still under warranty
ned glances at the white van parked in the driveway then takes note of his wifes silver mercedes
sitting on floor jacks the hood raised tools spread out around it
lana wears a diaphanous dressing gown buttoned unevenly hair disheveled
she smokes a cigarette
ned kisses her on the back of the neck as he passes through the kitchen on his way to the dining room
she reacts with bored contemptuous disinterest picking up the coffee pot
want some coffee
ned steps back into the kitchen with his briefcase
ned sees frank sitting at the kitchen table hair messed up coveralls hastily pulled on inside out
frank is reading a copy of insurance digest magazine
a headline on the cover touts an article life insurance for your cat
cover all nine lives for the price of one
neds smile fades
frank here was just grabbing a little before going back to work on my car
he steps over to the table
gives frank a cool stare
how long you been working on lanas mercedes frank
i dont know
six seven weeks
and ya still havent found the problem
a leering smile think i got my finger on it though
ned turns to lana
i know what hes doing lana
i wasnt born yesterday
hes not fixing your car
hes screwing you
lana tenses up at this
he figures theyve been busted
he sits there holding the magazine not moving a muscle
as ned turns on him
you are screwing my wife
i can see what your game is frank
you open up her hood poke around in there
squirt some lubrication in
play around with all her parts
then take an old used piston and stick it in
then pull it out
in out in out
theres no end to it
you just keep coming and coming
and the bill just gets bigger and bigger
lana braces herself against the sink breathless
turned on by neds description
ned goes to her sympathetic
but you dont see it do you lana
youre too good
you cant see the evil in people like him
turns to frank well youre not getting away with it pal
im pulling the plug
dont you have to be somewhere
checks his watch oh
im late for court
he goes to kiss her mouth and she turns her cheek to him
he looks at her lovingly
touches her face tenderly
you are so naive
he picks up his briefcase gives frank a nasty look then exits thru the back door
lana and frank stare at each other lustfully really hot now
frank sweeps the dishes off the table with his arm
lana leaps into his arms wrapping her legs around his waist
he lays her down on the kitchen table standing over her
suddenly ned opens the back door glaring right at frank
not even noticing lana on the table
finish your coffee
then get out
he slams the door
lana and frank begin to devour each other with passionate kisses
the front doorbell rings once
just the postman
he always rings twice
sequence omitted from original script
richly appointed with stately oak walls lined with law books
as in all noir thrillers venetian blinds cast dramatic slashes of light and ceiling fans turn lazily in every room
ned hurries in rummaging through the files on his desk
laura a strikingly lovely brunette enters from the outer office files in hand
she is neds astute dedicated self sacrificing girl friday and legal secretary
she keeps his life from spinning crazily apart
she absolutely adores him
do you know where
hands him file right here
the judge decided to skip arraignment and take milo direct to trial
youre six minutes late but dont sweat it
you got judge allen
hes always eleven minutes late
she picks up a lawbook flips it open to a dog eared page
i suggest you try lemming versus florida
where the guy jumped in the water and everybody followed
thinks about it yeah
he smiles gratefully
drops the file into his briefcase
ned heads for the office washroom
laura darts ahead of him into the washroom and turns the water on
ned steps in
splashes some water on his face
laura grabs a towel from the rack where three small towels hang neatly
hands it to ned
he dries his face looking at her with genuine fondness and gratitude
i dont know what id do without you
she glances toward the toilet notices it hasnt been flushed
she flushes it lowers the seat
she sits down on the toilet seat watching him adoringly as he shaves with an electric razor
laura how long have you worked for me
two years seven months twenty three days nineteen hours
checks her watch six minutes and fifty two seconds
softly to herself fifty three
and when was the last time i gave you a raise
laura neatly folds the end of the toilet paper into a point
but thats okay
i dont need a raise
i was thinking of giving you a rebate on my salary
he clicks off the razor turns to look at her for a long moment considering this then
you keep it
he gives her a manly pat on the shoulder then casually tosses the towel onto the rack where it hangs sloppily askew
right next to her face
laura stares at the towel with a tortured expression
the camera pushes in to her face as we see
scrawled on a steamed up bathroom mirror flashback cape cod three years earlier
a hand wipes the mirror off revealing laura
younger longer hair with a nasty black eye
lauras husband appears behind her glaring insanely
he looks toward the towel rack
there are three towels
with his his his embossed along the bottom edge
one towel hangs longer than the others
did we forget something
she meekly lines up all the towels
did we forget something
she meekly lines up all the towels
lauras husband pulls the cupboard open
all the cans and boxes are neatly stacked in straight lines
all except one
she straightens it
trembling with fear
he pulls her outside nodding toward a line of tall pine trees behind the house
they are all straight and even
except one whose tall branches tower conspicuously above the rest
he holds up a chainsaw nodding toward the trees
shaking and tearful
she backs into the house
screaming out in terror
ned rushes in shaking her
what is it
coming out of it im okay im okay
i just get a bit
in the bathroom
maybe we should try some prune juice
he gives her shoulder a consoling squeeze then exits
she shakily straightens the towels and regains her composure
ned opens a wardrobe closet in his office
he walks along looking at thirty exactly identical blue suits hanging neatly
laura follows behind him
he stops and stares indecisive
wear the blue one
ned turns dramatically to face the jury
ladies and gentlemen
i ask you
does this look like the face of a crook
sitting next to laura at the defense table
still wearing the panty hose over his head
of course it does
but the question of my clients guilt or innocence is not the issue here today
im certain every member of the jury can clearly see that hes guilty
ned ignores this turning to look directly at the camera as he addresses the jury
holding up a pair of nylon pantyhose
put yourself in his shoes
look through his eyes
see the world the way he sees it
he puts the pantyhose over the lens obscuring our view
things just dont look the same
the nylon pantyhose are draped over the frightened face of a woman juror
all the other jurors are holding up their own socks and nylon stockings trying to peer through them
ned steps over to milo motioning toward him
ladies and gentlemen
milo crumley is not the perpetrator here
he is the victim
milo unwraps a piece of bubble gum and pushes it into his panty hose covered mouth chewing the nylon and gum together
like all of us
this man is the unfortunate victim of these tragically difficult economic times
and what does that mean
he cant support his family
ned motions toward the gallery where we see
milos wife and two children all wearing panty hose over their faces
ned motions toward milo
for gods sake
he cant even support his own face
judge allen notices that milo is chewing gum
you cannot chew gum in my courtroom
unless you have enough for everyone
milo holds up a big plastic bag filled with bubble gum
judge allen grabs it takes a piece of gum and hands it to the bailiff
pass these out
the bailiff takes the bag offers one to ned
who takes a piece unwraps it and starts chewing
the bailiff then proceeds to pass out gum to everyone in the courtroom
the jury foreman raises his hand and clears his throat
and dont forget the jury
and so desperate and broke with no other options before him mr
crumley went to eleven savings loans and did what any of you would have done
he stole back the money that the s ls had stolen from him
the courtroom erupts in cheers
judge allen raps the gavel
please approach the bench
the judge leans toward him reaching out to cover the microphone covering the end of the gavel instead
the judges voice is amplified over the courtroom speakers
youre not running for congress here so knock off the speeches and quit inciting these brainless morons
now pick up the pace and wrap this son of a bitch up
call your first witness
looking out over the courtroom
detective ned ravine
there is a surprised gasp from the crowd
and a loud murmur
the bailiff holds out a video box
its titled holy bible the video
ned puts one hand on it raises the other
do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god
ned sits down
then gets up his demeanor changing
detective ravine at the time of the arrest did you read the defendant his miranda rights
he slips back into the witness box
thats standard procedure
ned steps over to arch who is sitting in the first row of the gallery
arch hands him the miranda cue cards
are these the cards officer brooks used to prompt you while reading mr
crumley his rights
he lays them on the corner of the stand
then slips into the chair
he picks the cards up and flips thru them
on the back we can see scribbled
neds idiot cards yeah
these are them
ned jumps to his feet pacing dramatically grabbing the cards
reading from the cards now
quote you have the right to remain silent if you waive that right anything you say
may be used against you in a court of law
is that right
back in the chair thats right
stands up announces wrong
the official miranda warning is
anything you say can be used against you in a court of law
on the attack dont you know the difference between can and may detective
every school kid knows can is a verb that indicates ability to perform while may is a verbal auxiliary indicating the permission to act
ned pivots into the witness stand changing his attitude from aggressive attorney to defensive angry witness as he hits the chair
i didnt have time to worry about past participles or interrogative pronouns
i was trying to protect society from a deranged madman
leaps up pointing but this ivy league fop
the courtroom erupts
the judge bangs the gavel
ned strides proudly toward the defense table
i have no more use for this witness
the judge motions with a finger for ned to approach the bench
ned does resting his hand on it
im dismissing this case on the grounds of improper grammar
the judge smacks neds hand with a ruler
jumps up but your honor
i know i know
its a technicality
but its the kind of technicality that makes the american legal system what it is today
the judge mistakenly picks up the microphone and whacks it on the bench like a gavel
it is deafening
everyone covers their ears in pain
the thx sound system logo appears at the bottom of the screen
along with the courtroom is listening ned turns the key
enters through the private door
he hears the plaintive sound of a saxophone playing lolas theme
his eyes drawn to the slightly opened door to the outer office
a gorgeous pair of legs sleek nylons high heeled shoes
there are several candy wrappers cigarette butts and other pieces of trash stuck to the bottom of one shoe
pushes the door open
she wears a tight white dress long white gloves and broad brimmed hat
the hat tips up slowly revealing her eyes
you never came back
ned reaches in his pocket pulls out a wet paper towel
i got busy
heres that paper towel i promised
howd you get in
the door was locked
lola proudly holds up a tiny bobbie pin
its miraculous what a real woman can do
with a bobbie pin
ned looks at the door
the frame and lock have been brutally chewed away as if someone used a jackhammer on them
she pulls out a pack of cigarettes
black lung lites
theyre bad for ya
he goes to the water cooler
she lights up exhaling a soft cloud of smoke through a sleepy smile her voice purring
yes i know
i like things that are bad for me
touching lawbooks so
i hear you go both ways
about to drink from the paper cup
it was a fraternity prank
i never saw him again
he gulps the water down crumbles the cup in his hand
no i mean
youre a cop and a lawyer
well theres a lot of scum out there on the streets
but they all deserve a fair and costly trial
ned turns tries to casually dunk the crumpled cup in the waste basket
laura enters with a huge pile of lawbooks in her arms
she sees ned miss the basket and darts over as he bends down to pick it up
ill get that
she picks it up and tosses it into the waste basket
this is uh
laura sets the heavy load of books on the desk and steps toward lola extending her hand
lola takes her time removing the long white glove
finally reaching out and shaking lauras hand with a condescending air
sarcastic so lovely to meet you laura
ned grabs the books and turns to the bookshelf replacing each lawbook in its proper slot
the handshake between lola and laura turns tense then aggressive eventually becoming a standing indian wrestle as they try to force each other off balance with sheer force
ned is oblivious to the battle behind him chattering away
gotta keep these darn books in their right place or well never find the ones we need
lets see q thru m
r thru b
w thru f
laura suddenly whirls lola around putting her in an arm lock
but lola elbows laura in the stomach
laura doubles over
lola feigns sympathy taking her hand
then spins twisting lauras arm flipping her head over heels
laura lands on the couch
lola strikes a haughty pose still holding her lit cigarette
she takes a drag
laura checks her watch then tumbles off the couch landing on her feet
she straightens her skirt
its getting late
ill give you a ride home ned
finished with the books ned turns
i have my car
ill tow you
you dont need to wait
ill see you tomorrow
lola looks at laura
icy haughty triumphant
laura moves reluctantly toward the door sees the lock and door frame chewed to pieces
whirls around heads back toward ned
i should call someone to fix this
she instantly spins around heads back toward the door
ill call from home
ned sits down on the corner of the desk
lola sits in the chair across from him
i think i should warn you mr
im not wearing any underwear
she crosses her legs suggestively
then slowly enticingly re crosses them in the other direction
unimpressed ned opens lauras desk drawer
pulls a pair of sexy lace panties from a kleenex style dispenser box labeled pandoras pop up panties
which pulls another pair up into position
he tosses the panties to lola
try these on
very very slowly and seductively
as they talk
what can i do for you
ive run across some
and i thought you might be able to tell me what they are
you see im not very experienced when it comes to
ill help you miss cain if im able
do you have the
theyre at home
i thought you might stop by
im on duty tonight
dont they ever give you a night off
picks up cigarette why dont we meet tomorrow evening then
she finishes pulling the panties on with a sultry smile
snapping the elastic waistband
she goes to the door pauses
turns to him
ill let you know where
steps over to her whats wrong with my office
she looks around exhaling another cloud of smoke
nothing a good interior decorator couldnt fix
she opens the door
behind her in the hall we see dizzy the saxophone player wailing away on lolas theme
she takes a final long drag on her cigarette then reaches o
take care of this for me will ya
with a sultry smile she turns and leaves closing the door
the cigarette is stuck in his nose
the front door swings open
frank is standing there dressed in a cheap loose fitting suit and a t shirt
i came back for my shower cap
lana now wearing the diaphanous gown pulls him inside
she kisses him hungrily slipping a frilly plastic shower cap with a gaudy floral design on his head
yeah well you came to the right place
she walks to the living room
frank follows still wearing the shower cap
lana snaps her fingers
he sits in a chair looking around
where is he
on duty all night
by the time he wraps up his reports itll be close to noon tomorrow
she sits on the couch picks up a stack of papers
i was just reading over
she looks up at frank
sees the shower cap
take off the hat frank
he slips the shower cap off as lana continues
i was just reading over my husbands insurance policies
you wouldnt know anything about insurance would you frankie
yeah matter of fact i sell policies part time
i got half a brain
or didnt you notice
i musta had my eye on something else
hands him papers how about a translation
he flips through scanning the pages shrugging
standard accident policy
all the usual stuff
blah blah blah
the face value is
three million bucks
flips page and theres a triple indemnity rider
aw its just something agents throw in so we can boost the premium
if the policy holder dies under very specific conditions it pays off three times the face value of the policy
nine million dollars
but its a sure bet for the company
nobody ever collects
well like here
it only pays off if hes shot with a pistol falls from a moving northbound train and drowns in a fresh water stream
see what i mean sweetheart
what are the odds of that
it could happen
dramatic beat suppose it did happen
then youd be rich
then wed be rich
whatre you sayin
she drops to her knees in front of him her face close to his speaking with a persuasive urgency
were gonna kill the son of a bitch
and i know exactly how
he has a legal symposium in santa barbara this weekend
all we have to do is get him to take the train up instead of driving
how we gonna do that
didnt you tell me he hates trains
thats where you come in baby
youre gonna rig his car so it doesnt work
that should be no problem for you
she gets up walks to the adjoining room
snapping her fingers at her side
she steps to a table pulls the cover off an elaborate scale model of dealey plaza and a train station complete with ho scale model trains chugging around the tracks
she uses a pointer to trace the route to the depot
we give him a lift to the train station
through dealey plaza past the book suppository and around the grassy knoll
isnt that out of our way
ignoring this she turns the lights off walks over to a screen and picks up a remote control
she clicks the button
a slide projector comes on throwing an image on franks back
we can read the words the plan
he moves over
the plan appears on the screen
and pay attention
as she talks images appear on the screen accompanying her rapid spiel
we see a shot of the depot a map of the rail route a gun a river a bingo game baseball action and a huge dollar sign
ten minutes out of the station hell be standing in the vestibule between cars
trying to avoid a panic attack
fourteen minutes and ten seconds out the train crosses the santa ynez river
so at thirteen minutes and fifty four seconds i shoot him shove him out the door
he hits the river and drowns
a triple play
the lights click on
you been thinking about this a lot havent you
it just came to me
closer seductive i had this image of a big powerful throbbing train
plunging into a long dark wet tunnel
they embrace kissing passionately dropping out of frame
the model train chugs faster the train whistle shrieking a long woooooooo woooooooooo
racing into a model tunnel
ned and arch drag in a bunch of bad ass multi ethnic gang members theyve just busted
ned angrily shoves one of the toughest gang members against the wall
losing his cool
stand over there and shut up
hey man we got rights
dont you be layin no deleterious malfeasance on us
ned goes ballistic and slams him into the wall again
watch your mouth punk
i dont want to hear language like that
arch grabs ned by the shoulder pulling him back calming him
whoa hold on hoss
take it easy
you seem a little tense tonight
what is it
ned regains his composure
i dont know
i guess its lana
i know she wants to have a baby so bad
gang member steps closer listening
but i never get to spend any time with her
and when i am home
its like shes you know
gang member steps closer listening
you should try to be more sensitive man
bring her flowers
he steps between them putting his arm around neds shoulder
try to understand how she feels
he steps back begins to sing try a little tenderness
she may be weary
women do get weary
wearing that same old shabby dress
but when shes weary
try a little ten der ness
the other gang members join in on the second verse with a sweet mellow street corner harmony as back up
and some smooth group choreography
the cops on duty listen raptly getting maudlin and dewey eyed
tears roll down the cheeks of the booking sergeant
the lights dim
a big gruff cop makes eyes at a hooker being booked
and they start to slow dance
arch watches all this with a sentimental smile munching on his nachos
when the song ends arch puts a comforting hand covered with nacho cheese on neds shoulder
that cant be it
im the tenderest guy on the force
i think shes just afraid she wont be able to get pregnant
whats to be afraid
its like making breakfast
you bring home the bacon
shes got the eggs
ya scramble it up
ba da boom ba da bing
shes got an omelette in the oven
a beat then why dont you knock off early
itd be nice for lana to wake up in the morning and find you there for a change
i got all this paperwork
dont worry about that
well do our own paperwork man
well fill out all that shit
ned nods smiles and gratefully high fives the gang members as he heads for the door
the house is dark
a key turns in the lock and ned enters
ned quietly undresses and slips into bed
sunlight creeps through the windows
lanas eyes flutter open
she sees ned beside her
suddenly it hits her
frank is on the other side curled up snoring
shes laying between both men
lana elbows frank
he stirs groggy
she covers his mouth
franks eyes bug out
he slips out of bed
the bed frame squeaks loudly
ned sleeps on steadily
frank grabs his clothes
an unending torrent of coins fall out of his pants pockets clanging on the floor
ned sleeps on
frank retrieves the coins clumsily stepping on the tv remote control
a high tech sleekly designed television monitor rises up
frank tries frantically to push the set down but it keeps rising into position
an image appears
its willard scott doing the weather on the today show
frank grabs the remote control frantically pounding on all the buttons
the volume goes up
on television and mrs
prudy ann camomile of delphi georgia is one hundred and thirteen
what a gorgeous hunk of female
smokes three cigars a day drinks a straight shot of vodka at bedtime
and still has sex
the alarm clock goes off clanging loudly
lana dives for it slamming her hand down killing the alarm
going for a double play she flings the clock at the tv nailing the on off switch
ned is still out cold
frank moves toward the door
but with each step the floor creaks loudly
he turns the knob
he pulls the door open v e r y s l o w l y and it cre e e e a k s like the piercing metal brakes of
he blows lana a kiss then pulls the door closed very gently
he pulls harder
the knob pops off in his hand and he falls backward tumbling down the stairs with a huge racket
ned doesnt stir
finally its silent
a small bird lands on the sill of the open window trilling a sweet little chirp
ned sits bolt upright irritated
he grabs his shoe heaving it toward the open window
frank glances back up at the bedroom window with an arrogant smirk
neds shoe hits him right in the face
ned comes down the courthouse steps
he pauses in the street glimpsing the back of a woman passing nearby
a stunning blond decked out in a clinging dress and fashionable hat
a long strip of toilet paper trailing from her high heel shoe
it must be lola
he turns to watch her
a horn blares
the sound overlaps to
the door opens
ned enters looking terrible
suit ripped hair messed up bruised and battered briefcase crushed
my god ned
you look like you were hit by a bus
notices whos in my office
max shadys mother
shady an older woman with a pleasant appearance sits in an overstuffed leather chair
ned and laura enter
ned goes straight to his office closet pulls out an identical blue suit
and starts stripping off his tattered clothes
check on my insurance
make sure its paid up
laura reluctantly returns to the outer office
good idea mr
my son max is getting out of prison tomorrow
checks his watch gee has it been seven years already
seven long miserable years in the slammer
and hes a bit pissed off
well being locked in a tiny room with no tv can make a guy feel pretty tense
im very concerned about him mr
he said you were a two bit shyster
and hes going to rip your head off and use it for a bowling ball
he goes to her putting a comforting hand on her shoulder looking her right in the eye attempting to provide solace
im sure the experience wasnt all negative
he probably made a lot of friends
ever hopeful you think
learned a useful trade
caught up on all those books he wanted to read
she struggles to her feet feebly
but he said hes going to punch you in the testicles
she hauls off and punches him like a pile driver
he doubles over gasping
smash your face
she knees him in the face raising him up
then nails him with a devastating right cross spinning him around
he collapses over the desk
and decimate your wardrobe
she grabs the tail of his suit jacket and rips it up the back
and i wouldnt want that to happen
spanks his butt hes a naughty naughty boy
i just thought i should warn you
she turns and shuffles out passing through the outer office
to laura bye for now
pauses by desk oh
may i have a cookie
at file cabinet sure
she grabs a handful of cookies and casually flings them at laura
as she heads out the door
laura rushes into neds office with the file folder
he staggers unsteadily by the desk
oh my god ned
i hate when she comes to see me
dont you realize ned
you could be in real danger
sees file whats that
you know the risk of personal bodily harm
points at file no
i mean that
your insurance file
but the policys missing
did you take it home
i dont think so
laura looks puzzled
wondering where it might be
oh wait a second
she goes to her desk in the outer office digs through a drawer
suddenly she gasps
she is holding
of her abusive husband
a circle has been drawn around his head with lipstick and a diagonal line slashed across his face
peers out through a sailboat porthole at stormy seas
a piece of masking tape stuck to the glass matches the diagonal line
lauras husband turns from the porthole
the boat pitches and heaves disturbing all the neatly hung towels emblazoned with mine mine mine across the bottom edge
lauras husband reacts with a crazed look in his eyes
laura makes a break for it running up on deck
lauras husband scrambles up onto the deck looking fore and aft
he looks out to sea calling
laura paddles ashore grasping a little kids inflatable float ring
she struggles onto the sand and looks out to sea triumphant
tossing the plastic float aside
laura rushes in tracking water all through the house
laura cuts an inch of hair from her amazingly long very wet tresses then puts on a wig
that is also long and laura retrieves a bra and a package of twinkies from a secret hiding place
and stuffs them into a small brown paper bag
laura hurriedly mops up her water tracks then
she uses an industrial buffer to wax the hardwood floor
laura removes her wedding ring
throws it in the toilet
she reaches for the handle to flush it
hesitates seeing the conserve water this means you
sticker on the toilet
she reaches into the bowl and retrieves the ring
on the deck laura throws the wedding ring toward the ocean
a seagull swoops down snatching it in mid air and flies off
sequence omitted from original script
in the bathroom
the seagull flies in through the open window lands on the back of the toilet and drops the ring
into the toilet bowl
lauras husband reaches into the surf and picks up the deflated float ring
he looks at it with a cruel sneer
lauras husband fishes lauras wedding ring out of the toilet bowl
looking off with demonic rage
from lauras screaming mouth
her eyes are filled with pure terror
a gigantic wave of water splashes in her face
we see ned
holding a tiny empty paper cup in his hand
laura is completely drenched
are you alright
that was a very long flashback you had
she snaps out of it sputtering
im just a little
she goes to her desk still upset
she picks up the message spike and turns to ned
that lola cain
she left this
she thrusts it toward neds face
theres a business card stuck on the end
he pulls it off
it reads le hot club
no air conditioning
and proud of it
scribbled next to it is the message
meet me at
the edges of the card are scorched
its dark seductive smoky crowded
everybody is dripping with sweat and holding unlit cigarettes
ned enters sees lola sitting on a stool at the bar one leg crossed provocatively over the other
a beer can is stuck to the gum on the bottom of her shoe
it falls off with a clunk
he sits on the stool next to her
she looks at him smiles
oh yeah before i forget
you asked me to take care of this
he reaches into his jacket pocket pulls out a lit cigarette
it has a very long ash
she takes it
inhales a drag then lets the smoke flow out through her smile
it flows out for a loooooooooong time
more smoke than she could ever have inhaled
you smoke too much
looks around then its hot tonight
i never know
my body heat runs about twenty degrees above normal
he notices the drink in her hand is boiling
a saxophone begins to softly wail lolas theme
ned looks over to see a quartet featuring dizzy on sax
the guitarist spontaneously bursts into flame
a fireman in full gear jumps up from the bar and puts out the blaze with a fire extinguisher
none of the band members miss a beat
maybe we should look for a cooler place
i doubt well find one
even the wind chimes on my porch arent moving much these days
they keep thudding softly like dairy cows bumping butts in the night
i go out there expecting to find a cool breeze
but its just a lot of hot air
ned glances at the male customers
sitting at the bar across from them
theyre staring coldly at ned
whatre they lookin at
a lot of them have tried that seat
youre the first ones lasted this long
i feel honored
a beat of realization then the stool collapses with a crash
ned pulls himself back up and drags another stool over
did you bring the
i thought you might come over
ill drive you
i brought my own car
ill follow you then
i know it sounds silly but would you leave first
wait in your car
i come here a lot and i wouldnt want those men to think im easy
a slut wholl jump into bed with anyone at the drop of a hat
but if you leave first
theyll think im a putz for passing up a sure thing
lola stares at ned for a long moment
then slaps his face
he doesnt move remaining staunchly macho
then suddenly she slugs him so hard it knocks him over the top of the bar
for all to hear now leave me alone
she pauses to give him a flicker of a coy smile
then picks up her drink and moves to a nearby table
ned struggles to his feet and staggers to the door
ned is a mess
blood trickles from the side of his mouth
shirt soaked in sweat
he turns the radio on
lolas theme starts playing
a small ceiling fan hangs from the interior roof of his car turning slowly
the venetian blinds on his side windows are partially open letting in slashes of dramatic light
hes following lolas car
it signals and turns left
still hot ned pulls the chain on the ceiling fan
it spins faster
the car becomes like a wind tunnel
the two cars enter a long drive coming to a stop near a large two story house surrounded by lush greenery
ned climbs out
his wind blown hair flattened on one side and sticking out crazily
lolas legs swing out
the camera pans down her long legs to her feet
the car floormat is stuck to one shoe
she casually shakes it off
going to the front door
ned squints into the shadows
well here we are
in the dark
i have the clapper
lola claps her hands twice and all the lights come on
she smiles at him
drops her car keys on the hall table then goes up the stairs
ned drops his car keys on the table too and follows her
lola clicks on a porch light
she and ned step out
dozens of small boxes hang around the perimeter of the porch
my wind chimes
ned steps over running his hands along the boxes
they thud against each other
you know these would work a lot better if you took them out of the boxes
he slips several boxes off releasing clusters of the metal chimes
they tinkle and clang melodically in the breeze
i guess you have been around
she moves close coming on to him
ned feels uneasy
why dont we take a look at those
lola comes in looks around then down
she removes her shoe pulling off two scraps of paper stuck to the gum on her heel
ned is looking through a book
kamikaze kama sutra the encyclopedia of deadly sexual positions
lola comes back in hands ned the two scraps of paper
these are the
theyre so confusing to me
can you tell me what they are
he checks them out
this ones a laundry receipt
and the other ones an expired lottery ticket
he hands them back to her but she gently pushes them away
you keep them
as a memento of our time together
she slips them into his jacket pocket
then sensuously slides her hands around him grabbing his buns pulling him closer
im so grateful
how can i ever repay you for all youve done
cash would be nice
isnt there some other way
i suppose you could wash my car
no i mean isnt there something else you want
something i could give you
she seductively starts to slide the jacket off his shoulders
theres a speed limit in this state
sixty five miles an hour
how fast was i going officer
oh about a hundred and twenty three
suppose you pull me over and frisk me
suppose i let you off with a warning
suppose i find a cop with a bigger nightstick
suppose i put you under arrest for being a bad girl with bad thoughts
suppose you handcuff me to the bed
rapid run on suppose i do and then we lose the key and while im gone to get a duplicate made the house catches on fire and i cant get
back to save you because the bridge is washed out and so you die a horrible death toasted like a polish sausage on a flaming spit
shakes his head nah
i better be going
he turns and leaves
she is stunned confused breathless
ned opens the door pauses turns
as lola joins him there
she looks into his eyes with desire
youre not so tough
she moves her lips close to his about to kiss him
i got a cold shower and a wife who trusts me waiting at home
whats the matter
dont you want me
its the way i look isnt it
he steps out pauses
turns to her
dont forget to lock up
ned pulls the door shut
the lock clicks
he pauses by his car realizing something heaves a sigh goes back to the door
he tries the knob but the door is locked
he looks through the small window
he sees lola standing inside
breathing heavily bracing herself against the staircase bannister hand to her heaving chest as if to calm a pounding heart
he pushes against the door
it wont budge
he goes to the large window gazing inside
she slides one hand enticingly across her breast and thigh striking a seductive pose
he points toward the door motioning for her to unlock it
she looks away
frustrated ned tries the window
he picks up a wrought iron chair slams it into the window
the heavy chair falls apart
the glass doesnt even vibrate
he sees a riding power mower in the driveway
jumps into the seat starts the engine
barreling toward the front of the house
thunder crashes and lightning flashes in the sky
he plows into the side of the house smashing a huge hole thru the wall
mowing a swath in the carpet
ned climbs off the mower moving toward her
she opens her arms breathless
the music swells dramatically
she intercepts him embracing him passionately
i knew youd come back
looking past her i forgot my car keys
he struggles free grabbing his car keys from the hall table
she follows embracing him again even more tenaciously
thats not what you came back for
yes it is
impatient she crushes her mouth against his kissing him hard desperately clawing at his clothes
devouring him with her lips and tongue
overwhelmed he succumbs to her passion
his car keys drop from his hand
she pushes him down toward the floor
her hands grasp his shirt ripping it open
the buttons fly in all directions
she grabs at his leather belt twisting it in her hands
ripping it in two
she grabs his pants by the cuffs
rips one pant leg off
then the other
tossing them over each shoulder
ned and lola tumble across the floor arms and legs entangled
rolling themselves up in a rug in the process
a roaring fire
we hear o
moaning and heavy breathing
the camera tilts down to a sheepskin rug in front of the fireplace
no one is there
a crystal vase falls crashing on the stone hearth
the camera tilts up to reveal ned and lola
stretched out on the mantle ravishing each other
the door suddenly bursts open
ned and lola tumble out
wrapped in each others arms food tumbling out with them
sequence omitted from original script
the table wiggles
the camera moves up to reveal ned and lola kissing passionately
she lays on the table arms and legs stretched upward
a spinning plate balanced on the pointed finger of each hand
and a large spinning platter balanced on the end of her pointed left toe
her right foot brushes the platter to keep it spinning
the ed sullivan show position
ned and lolas entangled legs moving under the sheets
ned sitting wrists tied to the brass bed with silk scarves
lola also with her wrists tied to the bed with silk scarves
a wider angle
revealing that they are both tied
at opposite ends of the same bed
wrapped in each others arms they tumble down the stairs
crashing into a workbench still kissing passionately
neds hand plugs in a cord
rack focus to a soft lambs wool buffer wheel rising into frame whirring
it dips into an open can of floor wax
then moves over to lolas naked body buffing the surface of her skin to a high gloss
the camera moves to her eyes
theyre crossed in ecstasy
squeaky bed noises
the camera moves up along the mattress
the bed moves with a jerky rhythm
the camera reveals lolas hand grasping the sheet tightly
we move up to lola lying face down against the pillow
ned jumps up and down on the bed like a trampoline
lola is on her stomach bouncing each time neds feet hit the bed
he does a complete back flip
then keeps bouncing
the wind blows
thunder and lightning
rain pours down
ned and lola both in yellow rain slickers ravish each other lustfully on the roof sliding down the incline of shingles
oblivious to the peril they slip right over the edge
they hang from the eaves trough each clutching it with one hand while still holding one another with their free arms
the trough breaks
they roll out of the bushes onto the lawn arms and legs entangled
they fall apart gasping for breath
that takes care of foreplay
neds eyes widen
lola grins lustily rolling on top of him
the cell wall is a clutter of photos hitler
and his mother mrs
a mans muscular naked torso rises into frame his back to us
hes doing pull ups his body covered with tattoos
quotes on each arm
dont have a cow man
and i know you are but what am i
pee wee herman
on one shoulder a gravestone with the epitaph i told you i was sick
in the center of his back
we see a big tattoo of neds face labeled dead meat
a guard opens the cell door
its time max
the prisoner turns
hes butt ugly hard nasty looking
its max shady
with a huge double corona cigar in his mouth
on his chest is a tattoo that reads this space for rent
he walks right toward the camera lens and the frame goes to black
two huge iron doors swing open and a mob of milling reporters rushes forward surrounding max shady
he wears a blue suit just like neds
the reporters have no microphones but shove their empty hands at max as if they do
they shout questions
whats the first thing youre gonna do now that youre out
find ned ravine
rip his head off and use it for a bowling ball
are you a good bowler
you ever bowled a three hundred game
how would you handle a seven ten split
say arent you wearing one of ravines trademark blue suits
the bastard gave it to me as a gift
to make up for losing my case
now im going to wear it to his friggin funeral
shady sees someone o
waves like a gleeful little kid
a ceiling fan rotates slowly
a pair of shorts and a nylon stocking hanging from the blades
the house is a wreck
the camera moves down to ned and lola both reclining in a big claw foot bathtub facing each other their arms draped lazily over the sides
neds eyes are closed
in a gadda da vida plays on the stereo in the b
lolas hand reaches for an ice pick on the floor raising it up slowly
ignites the cigarette lighter in the handle touching the flame to the end of her cigarette
she chips away a big chunk of ice from the block in a silver ice bucket beside her
then sensuously rubs the ice across her breasts
ned winces at the sight of this
lola smiles at him then lets the chunk of ice slide into the water
and pushes it between neds legs
he cringes eyes crossed
the familiar repetition of musical notes from the stereo drones louder
grabbing neds attention
thats madam butterfly isnt it
in a gadda da vida
listening oh yeah sure
now i can hear it
it tells the sad story of a woman who is rejected by her lover after a brief but torrid affair
so she stalks him with an ice pick and stabs him with it more than a thousand times
i never could understand the lyrics
he lifts his feet out of the water dangles them over each side of the tub
hes still wearing one blue sock
lola raises her feet out of the water
shes still wearing her high heel shoes
they are dripping
you know what happened last night was very uh
i should check on my homeowners insurance
but we cant ever let it happen again
what are you saying ned
that youre rejecting me your lover after a brief but torrid affair
ned pulls his feet in sits up
suddenly feeling vulnerable
he measures his words very very carefully
i wouldnt put it exactly like that
its just that
well im married to a wonderful woman
who is very very attractive
but adds quickly not that you arent very attractive
his voice begins to echo and fade as the camera moves in to a cu of lolas enraged eyes
voice echoing you arent very attractive
you arent very attractive
you arent very attractive
and then we see
a close shot of her hand grasping the ice pick
scratching it along the side of the tub peeling back the porcelain
a grating screech overlaps to
tight on a screeching tropical bird
we pull back to reveal ned looking around the store
his ripped pants have been temporarily repaired with big pieces of masking tape
a clerk steps over with two big parrots on her shoulders
dont touch anything
you bond with it
you buy it
id like to buy a pet
she eyes him suspiciously
for what purpose
its a gift
for my wife
they all say that
she spends a lot of time alone
i thought it might be nice if she had something to keep her company
how do i know youre not the kind of guy who punches out parakeets
or takes some poor defenseless animal throws it in a sack and runs over it with your car five or six times
i would never hurt an animal
boy i would
theyre driving me turns and shouts at the noisy birds
she turns back to ned
tell me more about this broad youre married to
i like to match people with the pets they deserve
a typical police squad room
smoke filled cluttered busy
arch sits at a desk doing paperwork surrounded by the gang members
who are also filling out papers
arch sings to himself munching on nachos from a big pile of chips
the gang members harmonize with him
a gang member reaches for a nacho chip
arch grabs for the gun in his shoulder holster
the gang member drops the chip
arch pops it in his mouth continues singing
the gang members join in with harmony
ned enters in the background carrying a box with airholes in it
he steps over to his desk looking at the singing gang members then motions like a choir leader cutting them off neatly
doubtful you do all my paperwork
they all hand over their completed paperwork
ned stares at them for a beat
get out of here
he opens the files
checks out the papers
arch notices something o
and gets up
and a damn good job too
one of em even did it in spanish
arch turns the sound up on a wall mounted tv monitor
friend of yours
on the screen
its max shady speaking to the press
id like to reach down ned ravines throat and pull out his guts with my bare hands
you hear that
hes just working through his anger trying to find a constructive outlet
are you kiddin
hell do it
the guys a friggin looney
trust me i spent a lot of time with him when i was preparing his case
hes really a very sweet sensitive human being
id like to mash his head like a ripe melon
he gets a little melon dramatic
then cut off all his fingers and rip out his liver with my teeth
loves to exaggerate
arch slumps in his chair really stunned
youre in deep shit
ned laughs it off
he starts checking through the messages and paperwork on his desk
the phone rings
he picks it up
neds face darkens
he turns away
speaking into the phone
i want to see you ned
whispering harshly i told you not to call me
its finished between us
no im not sucking anything of yours anymore
voice gets louder its done
he slams the receiver down shattering the phone
everyone stares at ned in stunned silence
shrugs it off wrong number
shes in the bathtub phone receiver in one hand still jabbing at the porcelain tub with the ice pick
water squirts from the holes shes punctured in the side of the tub
she flings the ice pick at the wall
lana is seated on a park bench wearing a trenchcoat hat and sunglasses
frank walks up looks around nervously pretending not to know lana
he sits down next to her
how come we gotta meet here
we have to be careful now
we cant risk being seen together at the house or someone might connect us to the murder later on
she hands him a hat
put this on
she takes her sunglasses off looks at him
he hesitates staring at the hat
a dignified looking older gentleman approaches
frank quickly slips the hat on his head
the older gentleman sits on the bench across from them
he opens a paper sack and begins neatly laying his lunch out next to him
an apple sandwich napkin mountain dew
whispers to frank speak yiddish
we see the sub title speak yiddish
from this point on all their dialog is in yiddish
but it appears in english sub titles across the bottom of the screen
ich hobe getracht efsher iz der nisht geshtoigen un nisht gefloygen
i been thinkin
maybe this plan is too complicated
zein nisht azoy meshige
der plan iz kosher vi yosher
the plan is perfect
he tosses crumbs of his sandwich to the pigeons occasionally glancing up at frank and lana
whenever they speak however his eyes look down toward their legs
with sub titles across the bottom of screen about knee level
ober mir darfen imvarfen in tsug
un schissen un schtippen in vasser arein
oy a broch
mir zenen git bakackt
yeah but we gotta get him on the train shoot him
then push him in the river
theres a million ways we can screw up

it happens to every guy
he looks around nervously
mir vellen zein oif groise tsures
mevet unz chapn
were going to be in big trouble
theyre going to catch us
theres very little risk involved
statistics reveal that less than thirty two percent of all murderers are ever apprehended
they both look at him
a long beat
you speak yiddish
but i can read sub titles
frank and lana are speechless
but across the bottom of the screen we see a sub title reflecting their thoughts
ned enters carrying the box
he sets it down on her desk
oh gee you shouldnt have
its for my wife
he goes into his office starts to change out of his tattered suit
laura talks to him from the outer office
wondered why you never came home last night
i told her you were working with a client undercover
she steps into the doorway of his office
theres lipstick on your collar
she returns to her desk
disturbed ned quickly pulls the shirt collar out checks it
no there isnt
but you answered my question
shes a real looker huh
i hadnt noticed
she opens the blinds behind her and looks at ned through the window between their offices
yeah i noticed how you hadnt noticed
returns to work thats alright
she noticed enough for both of us
she picks up a stack of papers from the fax machine
ned steps into the doorway wearing a clean shirt
i worry about you ned
i worry a lot

reading bits stick a knife in your
reacts next rip the eyeballs out of your
next drive razor sharp spikes under your
did you get to the one

shove it in a blender
tosses them aside hes just getting it out of his system
once they say it
they never do it
like the president
theres a knock at the door
they look up to see an ominous silhouette of a man on the milkglass
ned starts toward the door
laura grabs his arm stopping him
it might be him
she opens her purse pulls out a big colt
holding it out to him
ned stares at it taken aback
where did you get that
as if obvious from my purse
what are you doing with it
still obvious handing it to you
jeez laura what do you use a gun for
you shoot it
a bullet comes out
gosh ned after all your years as a cop id think youd know these things
put the gun away
he hands the gun back to her
goes to the door
theres a young delivery man holding a bouquet of flowers
checks card flowers for ned rav
looks up hey
arent you that lawyer guy
man you are dead meat
ned grabs the flowers slams the door
laura takes the envelope from the flowers
is this another sick joke from max shady
she looks at the card
her expression turning cold
what is it
hands it to him lola cain
she grabs the flowers
takes them into the bathroom
ill put these in water for you
ned opens the envelope
an audio cassette drops into his hand
written on the label play me
from the bathroom we hear the loud sound of a toilet its raining
ned pops the cassette into the tape player
i know this seems like a strange way to talk with you
but since you wont take my calls i have no other choice
then suddenly watch it
that red cars turning left
ned swerves to avoid a collision honking his horn
i love you ned
were meant to be together
then suddenly the lights changing
ned guns it
accelerating through a yellow light
then sincere again nothing can keep us apart ned
not even your wife
id hate to have to tell her about us but if necessary
we see headlights behind neds car
she is following him her eyes intense obsessed
dizzy sits in the back seat noodling softly on his saxophone
ned steps into the living room carrying the box
lana comes down the stairs pulling on a bathrobe
what happened to you last night
guilty as charged why
what have you heard
sarcastic you could have called
but then i suppose you were tied up
reflecting back only part of the time
i never know when youre coming home ned
how can i ever make any plans
in the b
through the window we see frank drop from the second floor right onto the seat of a waiting motorcycle
he zooms off into the night
ned steps up behind lana slips his arms around her
i promise ill spend more time with you
i know its been rough being alone so much
but ill make it up to you
maybe we should try again you know
to have a baby
she rolls her eyes at this
changes the subject
so whats in the box
i brought you a present
he hands it to her
she opens it looks in
she looks up struggling unsuccessfully to hide a look of displeasure
what is it
sorta like a cat
ned pulls out a pet skunk and puts it in lanas lap
she forces a weak smile
not enough like a cat
its a little skunk
i got it at birds and skunks r us
lola stands in the pouring rain outside drenched
staring at lana and ned through the window
whatre you going to name him
thinks about it yeah

ive always liked the name ned
he puts his arms around them both
so whatdya think
you love ned junior as much as you love me
the phone rings
lana stands up unceremoniously dropping the skunk into neds arms
she goes into
to answer the phone
then whispering frank
is that you
lola is in a glass telephone booth with venetian blinds and a ceiling fan
she cracks the blinds open
in the background through a window we can see lana in the house on the phone
filtered i told you not to call
ned enters the cavernous marble rotunda turns down a hallway crowded with milling attorneys and defendants
lola suddenly intercepts him
a newspaper trailing from her high heel shoe
the only frank i know is an auto mechanic
but i sure as hell wouldnt recommend the guy
hes really slow
he starts to move off but she stops him impassioned
i had to see you ned
i need to feel your arms around me
i wanna suck your toes til the nails pop off
lolas voice echoes
bystanders gather listening
ned looks around self consciously embarrassed
i told you what happened was a big mistake
a one night stand
i have a wife
the crowd presses closer
not missing a thing
a woman snaps a flash picture
a man turns on his video camera
it doesnt matter
shell know all about us soon anyway
i want you
in my bed
in my arms
mortified ned spins on his heels and makes a bee line for the safety of the mens room
lola holds up two tickets
i got us tickets to see iron butterfly
i hate opera
ned bursts in goes to the urinal
not noticing ben arugula an older gentleman in a business suit standing at the urinal next to him
a beat later
why are you running from me
didnt it mean anything to you
buffing my buns with carnuba wax
looks down come on neddy poo
pokey want to go exploring
hes busy right now
arugula glances sideways at ned curious and uneasy
look i told you
pokey made a big mistake
one lousy mistake in his whole stinkin life
so why dont you give him a break
he belongs to my wife
lana fires her gun rapidly
over her shoulder behind her back under her leg
a full body cut out of a man wearing one of neds trademark gray suits
a huge smoking hole has been blown right through the crotch
lana smirks inhales the smoke from the gun barrel
and blows it out
tilt down from an official government seal that reads ars gratia artis
judge ben arugula
the distinguished looking gentleman from the mens room sits on the bench
ned laura and a slimy defendant stand at the defense table
id like to congratulate mr
pokey for setting yet another unusual legal precedent
this is the first time ive ever tried a case in which the jury was found to be insane
the bailiff is handing out straitjackets to all the jurors
the jury foreman struggles to get his on and laced up
to another juror whatre you
a thirty eight long
the jury will be remanded to the center for unclear thinking in simi valley
the jury is led from the courtroom in straitjackets and chains
ned and laura follow them out
why didnt you tell me
its not important
i just had one last year
well im taking you out to celebrate
in the b
the slimy defendant pulls a gun and forces citizens
including judge arugula
up against the wall robbing them
oh no no
its no big thing
ill have another one sometime
and i want to get you a nice present
youre so sweet
you dont have to
you gave me a present last year
those lovely ginzu knives
arent they great
they last forever
and you can cut right through a shoe with em
as they walk off we hold on a close shot of a newspaper
the headline reads ex con stalks cop lawyer ned ravine
below it is a picture of max shady eyes wide with psychotic rage
a huge cigar in his mouth wearing a garish hawaiian shirt
hands lower the newspaper
revealing max himself with the same cigar shirt and crazed look on his face
laura models hats
each one becoming more outrageous
she coaxes ned into joining her
they both try on womens hats
smiling and laughing
as brown eyed girl plays
in one of the mirrors we see max shadys reflection
as he also tries on womens hats watching them puffing his cigar
laura wears a baseball cap with beer cans attached to each side with long curved plastic straws
the cap emblem reads beer bimbo
a price tag hangs from it
she is beaming
in the b
hawaiian dancers juggle flaming torches as they dance around an ice sculpture of a hula dancer
its nice to be off the streets
away from all the pain and misery out there
ned motions casually toward the world out there
sticking his thumb into the eye of a waiter who is bending over to pick up a spoon setting off a chaotic chain reaction of small disasters that finally culminates
with someone near the dance floor bumping into the torch juggler throwing his rhythm off
distracted he starts catching the flaming ends of the torches
he drops them all
the waiter who bumped into him politely picks up one of the flaming torches and hands it back to the torch juggler
he grabs the flaming end of the torch
and lets out a scream
he lunges toward a voluptuous hula girl ice sculpture grabbing the frozen breasts
his burned hands sizzle
ned and laura dont even notice
gazing only at each other
whats he thinking when he looks at me with that goofy smile
boy does she look stupid in that hat
if i told him how i really feel hed probably fire me
what am i saying
he probably doesnt even know i exist
and so smart
smart enough to recognize that ginzu knives are the gift of a lifetime
then concerned but she never goes out with guys
i wonder why
i guess ill just have to wait
but hes married
i could wait forever
maybe lana will get hit by a runaway truck
theres always a chance that
interrupting but who cares if she
i was just rambling
no no really
i just wanted to remind you about
the legal symposium
in santa barbara
in unison how to sue your loved ones
im driving up in the morning
sits at a corner table wearing a chic beret from the hat store voraciously devouring a huge hawaiian pit roasted pig
he wrenches the apple from the pigs mouth
takes a huge bite
a saxophone begins to wail lolas theme
ned looks up his eyes drawn to the lounge
striking a sexy pose on a bar stool eyes locked on ned
dizzy walks thru behind the bar playing his sax
she grabs a handful of cherries from a glass on the bar shoves them in her mouth cheeks bulging tongue moving furiously
a moment later she pulls out a long chain of inter locked cherry stems
ned reacts shaken glancing nervously at laura
she smiles unaware
his eyes flash back to lola
hes so cute
he cant even look me in the eye
neds reacts intensely to
she stretches out sensuously on the bar executing a series of humanly impossible erotic gymnastic positions
then wrapping her legs around a brass pole she spins no handed
until her thighs begin to smoke
the eyes of every male in the restaurant are riveted on lola
the table starts to rise slowly on neds side glasses sliding toward laura
she reaches out to stop them
noticing neds distracted expression
touching his arm what is it ned
you can tell me
sighs reluctant im a man laura
and all men feel passion at one time or another
what would you think of a married man who gave in to those wild sensual raging desires
she gulps eyes wide
the drums pound faster as the dancers in the b
pick up the frenetic tempo
what if for just one crazy moment he couldnt resist
he got knocked for a loop and lost control
smiles eager gosh
that might be okay
breathless she breaks a sweat gasping for air
the drums beat louder faster
dancers whip into a frenzy
what if a tidal wave of lust crashed over him and he was sucked into a vortex of wild thrashing urges
both of lauras ballcap beer cans explode
beer sprays out in a huge gush drenching her
ned is so preoccupied with his own dilemma he doesnt even notice
he heaves a sigh
pats her hand
its not your problem
ill work it out
grasped tightly in lolas hand
she walks toward ned and laura a seething rage in her eyes
as she passes the ice sculpture she stabs the ice pick into the crystalline hula dancers neck
the head breaks off
she catches it and keeps coming tossing the head casually in one hand like a basketball
lola appears suddenly at ned and lauras table
they look up
to laura like some ice for your drink
she drops the ice mermaid head
it shatters lauras glass to bits
lola turns to ned with a cold glare
does your wife know youre
i certainly hope so mr
she lights her cigarette with the ice pick lighter then flips it like a jackknife
it sticks into neds chair right between his legs
lola flashes a coldly arrogant smile at laura
frank opens the hood to neds car holding a screwdriver in one hand
a wrench in the other
he doesnt know where to start
a newsboy tosses a folded newspaper
it lands at max shadys feet
max picks up the paper opens it
the headline says shady reads newspaper in front of ravine residence
max looks around self consciously eyes shifting uneasily
lana stands by the front door
she calls upstairs to ned
hurry up darling
youll be late
frank slips in wearing his greasy overalls
he wipes his hands on a rag
giving lana a sly wink
whispering its all taken care of
when do i knock on the door
wait until i signal you
when i raise the blinds
she steps over to the blinds and demonstrates
she nods patronizing
lana picks up the skunk cuddling him
ned comes down wearing his trademark gray suit
lana kisses him passionately
a final farewell
drive carefully sweetheart
say bye bye to little ned
he loves his daddy
dont you stink pot
pets the skunk see you tonight junior
as soon as ned closes the door lanas smile vanishes and she casually tosses the skunk aside with a loud crash o
ned turns the car key
he gets out opens the hood
ned comes in visibly upset
lana acts surprised
this neighborhood is getting worse all the time
damn kids stole my engine
why dont you catch the train to santa barbara
it leaves in twenty minutes
ill just fly up
ned looks at her strangely
she catches herself
armed terrorists seized the airport this morning
a plane crashed into the tower
and all the runways are on fire
and its fogged in
for my peace of mind
take the train
lana goes to the window starts to raise the blinds
i cant do it
you know how i feel about riding trains
letting the blinds drop down
its only a short trip
a short trip
she starts to raise the blinds again
he picks up the phone
he hesitates a short trip to hell in a metal tomb
he slams the receiver down
lana drops the blinds again
just because both your parents died in a train wreck
and my brother jeff
and your brother morty
my two sisters
my best friend al
my dog woof
and uncle lionel
all killed by trains
very convincing coincidence ned
thats the past
sighs resigned yeah
i guess i cant bring them back by not riding on a train
she starts to raise the blinds again
but i just cant get over this stupid nagging fear that
she abandons the blinds leaving them raised part way
what about our baby ned
i dont want to raise a child in a home filled with fear
theres a knock at the door
lana tugs on the cord and the blinds drop with a crash
the knocking stops
she pretends it didnt even happen racing on
but if you can conquer your fear
maybe i can conquer my fear of having a baby with a father whos fearful
goes for broke ned
dont let a train kill our child before its even conceived
heaves a sigh i guess youre right
she grabs the cord then hesitates
youre sure now
she quickly pulls the blinds up
but well never make it to the station
by the time a cab gets here
a loud knock at the front door
lana opens it
i was in the neighborhood
thought id stop by and pick up my tools
frank will drive you
wont you frank
sure ill take you to the train station
they all freeze
lana glares at frank who is completely unaware of his faux pas
while ned tries to figure out why that response didnt sound right
they climb into the van
ned nervously checks his watch
well never make it
the camera booms down low to reveal max shady under the van hanging on like a leech his back only inches from the road
the van drives off
at an intersection
they see a detour sign
frank and lana exchange concerned looks
frank turns the corner
the van starts vibrating violently tossing them around
checks his watch were not going to make it
well make it
he shifts gears guns the engine
they rocket ahead bouncing wildly their heads thumping the car roof
the van splashes through deep water a huge fantail spraying out on both sides
the train is pulling in
the camera pans to franks muddy van as it drives up nearby
frank waits in the van as ned and lana get out and walk toward the train
they pass a feeble old woman struggling to drag a huge steamer trunk along the platform
inches at a time
a redcap passes her also carrying a small overnight case for an attractive elegantly attired socialite
everyone ignores the old woman
ned looks nervously at the train already pale
now whatre you going to do if you feel queasy going through the tunnel
ill stand in the vestibule between the cars
when you get queasy
go stand in the vestibule between the cars
she kisses his cheek
he reluctantly boards the train
her smile vanishes
she hurries back to the next car nods at frank boards the train
frank peels off his coveralls follows her on
lauras husband steps from the train holding the deflated ninja turtle float ring
he looks around then walks toward the cab stand
the camera moves with him then holds on
the headline says shady vows blender vengeance on ravine
under the headline is a picture of max shady
muddy bloody greasy clothes ripped cigar shredded
the paper lowers revealing max
a battered mess looking off
he picks up a small violin case and quickly moves toward the train as it starts to pull out
we now see that the seat of maxs pants has been ripped out his naked buttocks scratched and scraped raw by the road
ned stares out the window
frank and lana enter at the opposite end of the coach
they spot ned quickly ducking into a seat where they can observe him yet remain hidden from view behind the tall seatbacks
max walks through the car looking for ned
he pauses puffing on his big cigar
a woman passenger looks up and is shocked to see maxs scraped bare butt hanging out only inches away
my dear gracious
max swivels around to look at her
turning his bare behind toward an irritable man across the aisle
would you please extinguish that foul smelling cigar
turning slowly you want me to put out my cigar
you want me to put out my cigar
you want me to put out my cigar
max enters through the vestibule without his cigar stopping in his tracks when he sees ned
he smiles to himself then ducks back into the lavatory
max looks at himself in the mirror
hes a disaster
he opens the violin case pulling out his trademark ned ravine gray suit on a hangar
its not even wrinkled
ned looks pale
reacting tensely to every lurch and bump the train makes
the feeble old woman strains to pull her huge steamer trunk down the aisle inch by inch toward ned
lana peers over the seat watching ned with a cruel smile
its already getting to him
hell be out of that seat and into the vestibule within ten minutes
i guarantee it
max is cleaned up dressed in the suit
he straightens his tie slicks his greasy hair back sticks a big cigar in his mouth and grins at himself in the mirror
you talkin to me
you talkin to me
he reaches into the violin case pulls out a complex assortment of metal parts assembling them swiftly
its an incredibly nasty looking high tech automatic weapon with gigantic cartridge clip
he screws on a long silencer and points the gun at the ceiling
a muffled gunshot
debris fall around him
he looks up
he has blown a hole through the roof of the coach
he adjusts the silencer volume control which has a scale from thru
he turns it all the way down to
he pulls the trigger
the gun recoils but there is absolutely no sound
he has blown another hole in the ceiling
ned looks across the aisle to see a gross slob pulling all kinds of strange food items from a paper bag making a big sloppy disgusting sandwich that squirts and
drips all over
ned turns away
really queasy now
max reaches into the case pulls out a blender
he plugs it into the outlet and revs it a couple times grinning wickedly
max steps out of the lavatory and sees the conductor coming his way collecting tickets
he quickly spins around slides the door open and steps into the vestibule between cars
the conductor cant get past the old woman so he climbs over the top of her trunk with no thought of helping her
max looks out the side window trying to conceal the weapon in front of him
the conductor enters sees him
without turning max holds the ticket up over his shoulder
the conductor takes it punches it notices the gun barrel
automatic weapons are only allowed in the club car after nine p
max turns raising the gun with a nasty growl
the conductor casually snaps a baggage tag to the barrel taking the gun
ill check it with baggage
you can claim it at the depot in santa barbara
the conductor drops the weapon into a big mesh bag
along with a dozen other guns hes collected
max whirls around facing the window eyes filled with rage
a gun barrel slowly protrudes between the seats in front of frank and lana
their eyes widen
suddenly a stream of water hits frank in the face
a little kid named jeff scrambles into the aisle
im jeff and im eight years old
didja know if ya put a penny on the track itll make the train crash
you ever been in a wreck
my uncle has
its really neat
everybody gets creamed
all bloody guts
heads ripped off and stuff
wanna hear my song great green gobs of greasy grimy gopher guts
lana turns to frank
she leans toward jeff
you want to earn a couple bucks kid
jeff bounces into the seat across from ned
im jeff and im eight years old
didja know if ya put a penny on the track itll make the train crash
lana peers over the seat at ned
hes losing it
you better get up to the next car
remember give me the high sign as soon as you see the river
itll be two minutes and nine seconds past the tunnel
ill take care of the rest
anything goes wrong
just make sure you back me up
grabs his collar and dont let him see you
frank gets up moves down the aisle slowly eyes on ned
he cant squeeze past the old woman who is still struggling to pull her huge trunk down aisle
he climbs right over the top of it
oblivious to her
frank stares at ned warily as he gets closer
suddenly jeff squirts a stream of water in neds eyes
frank sees his chance rushing past ned toward the vestibule
frank races through the vestibule behind maxs back
by the time max turns to see whos there
frank is gone
ned wipes the water from his eyes blinking
he grabs the squirt gun away from jeff holding it up angrily
is not a toy
yes it is
ned realizes hes right
acting tough he pulls the plug and drains the water out of the gun then tosses it back to jeff
without missing a beat jeff drops the empty water magazine from the grip and jams a full one in
just like loading a cartridge clip
he smirks ready for action
in the aisle next to them the old woman now pulls her trunk back toward the vestibule
jeff points the squirt gun at her
suddenly she whips around and squirts him in the face with her own squirt gun
max stares out the window still seething
behind him the old woman moves into the vestibule inch by inch trying to drag her trunk into the first coach car
max turns sees her struggling and goes to her aid
let me help you with that
he pushes the trunk into the first coach car then very politely holds the door open for her
she smiles sweetly at him as she shuffles through
what a nice young man
you are so polite
smiles i try to be
jeff is singing to ned
to the tune of the old gray mare
great green gobs of greasy grimy gopher guts
mutilated monkey meat
chopped up dirty birdies feet
one pint jar of all purpose porpoise pus
cooked in a mulligan stew
ned turns queasy
the train lurches
the old woman has unpacked her huge trunk
she has hung up clothes
set out a vase with flowers
hung up a big framed painting
and turned on a floor lamp
she pulls out a set of dumbbells pumps them a couple times
and drops them on the floor with a loud clunk
frank watches her from his seat across the aisle with a blank expression
only his eyes moving
the conductor punches the old womans ticket then holds out his hand waiting
she pulls out a smith wesson
drops it in his bag
she pulls out an uzi
up ahead we see a tunnel approaching
sequence omitted from original script
still singing french fried eyeballs and ugly scabs you wanna pick
stuff to make your mother sick
dog poop on a stick
puke and snot all mixed together in a pot
ned is looking very pale and queasy
suddenly jeff jumps up
presses his face against the window
here comes the tunnel
ned cant take it anymore
he gets up pale and sweating
racing toward the tunnel
lana sees ned stumble shakily into the aisle moving toward the vestibule
way to go ned
right on time
the train enters the tunnel
everything goes pitch black
a few beats then
light fills the car again as they emerge from the tunnel
ned is gone
she heads down the aisle
the conductor is still tagging weapons as the old woman comes up with a ruger mini machine gun a mauser c automatic handgun a sawed off double barreled
and an old wooden slingshot
lana looks through the small window into the vestibule and catches a glimpse of a gray suit
she ducks back leaning against the lavatory door
neds dripping face rises up from the sink into view
he splashes more water on trying to overcome his queasiness
lana reaches into her purse pulls out a gun
she looks through the vestibule windows into the first coach car her eyes searching for frank
frank pokes his head out into the aisle looking toward lana
he waves at her
lana ducks back pressing herself against the lavatory door
gripping the gun tense
ned starts to open the door then stops
he notices the violin case
a couple of bullets roll around inside
then he sees the blender
lana leans forward looking through the vestibule windows watching desperately for franks signal
frank looks out the window and sees
it looms ahead
lana sees franks frantic signal
she raises the gun pulls the hammer back and steps quickly into
max hears someone enter
ned steps out of the lavatory
blowing a hole right through max and the window behind him
she keeps firing
more bullets than the gun could ever possibly hold
ned hears the gunshots and whirls around looking into the vestibule through the glass window just as
max turns to face lana filled with bloody bullet holes
you shootin at me
shocked to see its max lana empties the rest of the bullets into him
max is slammed back into the vestibule door by the impact
youre definitely shootin at me
she fires one last shot
max flies out the door executing a perfect full gainer with a triple twist and a half tuck
a flawless olympic style dive
ending with a dead body belly flop into the water
frank sees max hit the river and lets out a loud whoop
the old woman shoots him a nasty look
he stifles himself
ned slides the vestibule door open
steps toward lana
in a daze she raises the gun points it at him pulling the trigger
he takes the gun from her gently
frank jumps up rushing forward
he skids to a stop
seeing ned through the glass
shocked he ducks back
in this crazy world theres not a whole lot a guy can count on
but when the chips are down i can always count on you
he takes her hand gently and kisses it
you risked your life to save mine
a guy cant ask any more from a woman than that
he snaps a handcuff on her wrist
but i saw you shoot him lana
in cold blood
i gotta arrest you for murder
im a cop
i have a job to do
you said it yourself
i saved your life
dont worry baby
i know a good lawyer
whirls at us snapping to a stop in someones hands
the hands turn it rightside up
the headline reads the paper lowers revealing lola cain with a gratified smile
ned and laura move up the steps surrounded by reporters and media people
questions are being fired from all sides
what kind of gun did she use
thats a question for the arresting officer
arent you the arresting officer
youll have to ask her attorney
but arent you her attorney
only her husband can answer that
what will mrs
ravine be wearing at the trial
ned stops at the top of the stairs turning to the reporters
a lovely powder blue dress with a cinch waist full bodice and a delicately pleated skirt
does it have a matching jacket
is it cotton or rayon
perturbed i said
ned and laura turn and enter the building
calling out did she eat any of the victims body parts
theyre really throwing some tough questions out there today
theyre just doing their job
well i call it a high tech lynching of an uppity white housewife
its huge dark and shadowy
more than a dozen heavily armed police officers stand guard all around the perimeter
in the center is a cell constructed of iron bars like an animal cage
ned and laura enter
arch steps over
seeing the cage whats this
only cell available
they had that serial killer locked up here
you know the one who talks his victims to death then eats them
hannibal the lecturer
but they let him out for a three week tour to publicize his new book
arch hands him a hardbound book
reading the cover to serve man
its a cookbook
ned flips it over
on the back is a picture of hannibal the lecturer
wearing a baseball catchers mask with barbed wire over the mouth
and look look
he autographed it
arch pulls the front cover of the book open pointing
reads it to arch
love to have you for dinner sometime
hands it back very nice
arch points toward the cage
theyre waiting for ya
they didnt want to start without her attorney being present
theres a big moth on her mouth
the camera pulls back slowly
she spits the moth off irritated
this place could use a good exterminator
three police investigators sit opposite lana at a long table
moths flutter everywhere
to police guard lets get the swat team in here
ned laura and arch enter the cage as the guard exits
cant you get me out of this cage ned
im goin buggy in here
judge said no bail
just tell the truth youll be fine
he turns to the investigators
whos gonna handle the interrogation
its your collar
ill handle it
laura sits at the far end of the table and opens her notebook
lana pulls out her mirrored compact starts to apply lipstick
theres no makeup allowed in this building
he nods toward a warning sign a circle around a lipstick with a diagonal line thru it
she responds cool confident
whatre you gonna do
arrest me for primping
in the b
members of the swat team desperately swat at the fluttering moths
ned spins his chair around plants one foot on it leans on his knee looking hard at lana
dont give us a tough time
just spill it
what were you doing on that train
ned raises his hand sits down leans close changing his tone
confidential as your attorney i must advise you
you dont have to answer that question
ned stands paces agitated
plants his foot on the chair again
he leans toward her
getting tough again
alright quit playing games with us
fires questions who put ya up to it
whered you get the gun
whats your link with the ned jumps in motioning with his hands for this to stop
whoa whoa whoa whoa
i will not tolerate this unwarranted badgering of my client
shell have her day in court gentlemen
he slams his briefcase shut and turns to lana sincere
i want to thank you mrs
ravine for being so cooperative with these gentlemen
turns to laura did you get all that down laura
every word she said
both of em
the camera moves in to a wire mesh cage at the very back of the yard
a small sign on it says ned junior
the door is open
the cage is
lola rides the roller coaster with lanas pet skunk
she laughs maniacally as they plunge down a steep grade
the skunk stands stiffly on her lap his paws planted on the guard rail eyes bulging out
his fur standing straight up
ned hesitates at the front door
its open a crack
he moves inside cautiously
there is a strange bubbling sound coming from the kitchen
he moves toward it
he enters the kitchen and sees
a huge bubbling pot on the stove foam spilling over from under the lid
his mind reels
he charges out the back door
ned bursts out the back door
camera tracking with his feet as he dashes across the huge back yard
he sees the empty animal cage
the door is open
a fuzzy blanket hangs halfway out
shocked ned spins around
running back toward the house
camera tracking his feet struggling to keep up
the camera slams into a tree
cracking the lens
ned bursts in
sees the bubbling pot
a huge butcher knife on the counter
and lola arms outstretched to greet him
she whips the cover off the bubbling pot
she lifts up pasta with a spaghetti spoon
tossing a sprig of basil into the pot from the basil leaf crown she wears
pasta with tomato sauce
you dont like italian
wheres ned junior
where is he
i thought he might like to get out so i took him to the amusement park
he grabs lolas arm and drags her toward the front door
you cant just break into my house cook my food
borrow my skunk
opens the door leave me alone
stay out of my face
out of my neighborhood
out of my she steps outside
turns to him
you havent seen the last of me ned
he slams the door in her face
hesitates a beat curious
then pulls the door open
lolas still there
i told you
ned slams the door again
its a media circus
vendors sell trial balloon balloons
press photographers cluster around a squad of cheerleaders wearing sweaters emblazoned with free lana or bust
across their chests
they perform a rousing cheer in front of a sign on the building that reads
with choreography lana lana shes the one shot a bad guy with a gun blew that sucker off a train some guys are a friggin pain yaaaaaaaaaaaaay lana
a bbc commentator speaks to a tv camera
once again americans are making a mockery of their courts turning a murder trial into a media circus
how can justice ever prevail when it is ridiculed and reviled in such a heinously revolting manner
this is clement von franckenstein returning you to our bbc studios in london for the latest photographs of lady di naked in the bath
ned and laura push their way through the crush of reporters
spectators pour through several turnstiles shoving in their tokens
tv cameras have been set up to broadcast the trial
a uniformed theater usher escorts jury members in checks their tickets hands them programs and directs them to their seats
ned and laura sit at the defense table next to lana
who is oblivious to everything deeply engrossed in a pocket video game
ned looks toward the gallery and does a disturbed take
sitting in the back row wearing a tailored suit large brimmed hat with dark veil
and a skunk skin stole draped around her shoulders
dizzy sits next to her playing softly on a muted sax
a sportscaster delivers play by play of the action
what a great day for a trial
we have lots of incandescent lighting seventy two degrees inside
and no wind
superior court of los angeles is now in session
and here he is
direct from a triumphant one week engagement in las vegas circuit court
the totally irrepressible
judge harlan skan kyyyyyyy
flashing applause signs and flashing all rise audience prompters
everyone gives the judge a standing ovation
has this defense team been hot
thirty seven straight victories this year
lets go down for the coin toss
the bailiff flips a coin motions to the prosecutor
the prosecution wins the flip of the coin and elects to kick things off
the prosecutor delivers her impassioned opening statement
the prosecution will prove that this repulsive and degenerate woman coldly murdered a decent law abiding citizen
jumps up objection
move to strike
hearsay irrelevant stupid idiotic caca doody poo poo
laura is on the stand
ned hands her a sheet of paper
and can you tell us what this is
its a death threat that max shady faxed to you on the day he was released from prison
ned snatches it back pacing folding it into a paper airplane
a fax in which he threatened to puree certain parts of my anatomy in a blender
id like to submit this into evidence
jumps up objection
who cares about the fax in this case
ill allow it
ned sails the paper plane toward the court clerk who is at an evidence table already piled high with tagged guns appliances knickknacks auto parts and other junk
the plane sails toward an open window
the clerk grabs it
going out the window with the plane
the cheerleaders lead the spectators in an exuberant cheer
u g l y
you aint got no alibi
yeah youre ugly
m a m a
how you think you got that way
yeah your mama
in the b
the court clerk plummets to the ground then staggers to his feet and stumbles
back toward the courthouse
one of the jurors watches a dick van dyke re run on a small portable tv monitors oblivious to the testimony
in the b
the battered clerk stumbles back in with the paper plane
the conductor is on the stand
ned holds up a blender
and is this the blender you found in the lavatory of the train
id like this marked as evidence
the bailiff reaches out ned waves him off
instead tossing the blender over several heads to the court clerk
who runs to catch it crashing into the wall
the blender falls awwwww
a bad call by ravine
lets check out the re play
on the re play screen we see the action repeated in slow motion as the sportscaster draws lines circles xs and squiggles
look at that
the bailiff is wide open
but instead of handing it off ravine goes for the long bomb
the pass is wide
a real wobbler
theres no way
he scrambles but he just cant get his hands on it
and right there
freezes the frame wham
that blender is gone
at the defense table laura glances over at lana who is casually browsing through a copy of gals guns magazine
laura reacts then trying to be as diplomatic as possible
did you ever consider that maybe you dont know women as well as you think you do
now would you tell the court in your own words what you said to mr
they both look toward the witness stand
ned is shaken
whispers im really worried about this guy
he could blow our whole case right out of the water
jeff the little boy from the train is on the witness stand
the prosecutor stands by listening as
singing great green gobs of greasy grimy gopher guts
mutilated monkey meat
itsy bitsy birdie feet
great green gobs of greasy grimy gopher guts
and me without a spoon
the jurors turn pale and reach for the air sickness bags in front of them
the courtroom erupts
the judge pounds his gavel loudly
pointing at lana that lady paid me two bucks to sing it to him
but no one hears this in all the confusion
the judge also looking ill now bangs his gavel again
the judge jury attorneys and spectators are all playing on the swings teeter totters monkey bars
having a blast
ned and the prosecutor play dodge ball
laura cheers ned on
the prosecutor rockets the ball at ned
and just misses
gotcha dork face
no you didnt
missed by a mile
the bailiff steps into close up blowing a whistle loudly
recess is over
move it move it move it
marching band music fades off screen
there they go
the ucla marching band
it looks like the victims mother
is gonna take the stand
this will be the first defensive play of the afternoon
shady is on the stand

was he a
a good boy
he was the best
and thats not just a mother talking
you can ask anybody
but he got into trouble once in awhile
like all kids do
well you know pranks
little jokes and things
but he was so cute

she reaches down into her huge purse pulling out a photo album
she opens it showing ned
this is when he set the cat on fire
then assuring him oh
but the cat deserved it
looks points and what uh
what are these
he just loved to toast marshmallows over a roaring cat
burned on the outside
all soft in the middle
turns page and right here
this was taken on the day he left the priesthood to join the green berets
they rise slowly out of their seats craning their necks trying to see the photos
ned is now seated next to mrs
shady in the witness box looking at the photo album with her
judge skanky peers over the side of the bench
this is cute
laughs delighted oh yes
that was during his ku klux klan phase
he would take the sheets right off my bed
cut those little holes in them
what a stitch he was
are now on their feet all straining to catch a glimpse of the photos in the album
and is this max
with all the tools
fixing his bike
she snatches the photo out of the album
why that shouldnt even be in there
its his rotten little half brother
rips up photo stinkin little pecker
he never was any good
the sportscaster is pushing his face against the broadcast booth glass trying to see what everyones looking at
points at another oh
i didnt like these neo nazi boys
they were all so fussy and persnickety about everything
heil this and heil that
flips the page oh look
heres max with his chainsaw
he loved to go to the national park and cut down those giant old trees
it made him feel so patriotic
you know if he hadnt been such a successful criminal
i think he would have been a lumberjack
the court clerk bailiff and court recorder have all moved around behind the witness stand peering over mrs
shadys shoulder at the photos
tearful angry but now hell never be anything
stands up points that woman your wife pulled the trigger and put my little max in his grave
do not point your finger in my courtroom
its discourteous impolite and disrespectful
dont you tell me what to do with my finger
its been more places than youve ever dreamed of
bangs gavel sit down
ill point my finger wherever i want
shady goes berserk
leaping from the witness stand pointing several different fingers at judge skanky
the bailiff attempts to restrain her but she breaks free
scurrying around the courtroom pointing fingers at everyone
the irritable man from the train is on the stand
maxs huge cigar stuck in his ear
the hair around his ear is scorched
did you encounter the victim
on board the train
and i told him
this is the no smoking car
would you please put out your damn cigar
and is that the cigar in your ear
the man strains to see the cigar out of the corner of his eye
impatient ned finally holds up a small pocket mirror
i believe it is
id like the cigar and the head of this witness entered into evidence
the bailiff picks up the irritable man and dumps him on the evidence table where he is tagged by the court clerk
the defense calls
lana is on the stand
the bailiff swears her in
do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god
looks to judge do i have to answer that harlan
no no dear
ill vouch for her
may i call you lana
call me angel tits
you will address angel tits as mrs
after a beat mrs
would you please tell the court
what were you doing on that train
i saw max shady at the station
saw him get on board
i knew hed made threats to kill you and mutilate your reproductive organs
ned and every male in the courtroom winces at this doubling over in imagined agony
lana pauses then continues
so i got on the train too
so i could warn you
do you want to have children
with the right man
but you couldnt have children if my
makes a gesture were
another gesture and uh
it would be difficult
so you followed him knowing you had to protect me
your best friend
the man you love
the future father of your children
something like that
and when you saw that maniac standing in the vestibule waiting to pulverize my pee pee
you pulled the gun and fired and fired and fired
and fired and fired and fired and fired and fired and fired and fired
she pauses to count off on her fingers then
and fired and fired and fired
the defense rests your honor
the courtroom artist has been sketching intensely throughout the trial
we finally see
hes been sketching a bowl of fruit on the court recorders desk
ned picks up some fruit from the bowl and approaches the defense table
how can you convict a courageous woman who risked everything to save the life of her beloved husband
a woman who acted boldly to stop a demented maniac from doing this
ned shoves the banana and two plums into a demonstration blender on the defense table
he hits the puree button and the blender whirrs loudly
shouts over pulverizing the private parts of the man she loves
all males in the courtroom react with pained expressions cringing and doubling over
ned turns the blender off
directly to jury lana ravine is a loving wife and the potential mother of my potential child
i challenge you to strike a blow for motherhood and the american justice system
put the con back in the constitution
put the ju back in jurisprudence
put the can back in american
and put the dom back in freedom
find this woman innocent
so we can all go to bed happy tonight
a reporter opens the door marked press room
inside a dozen reporters press their pants on a dozen ironing boards
the jurys back
the reporters scramble for the door pulling their pants on
the camera follows a folded piece of paper as the jurors pass it along to the foreman
who hands it to the bailiff
who hands it to the judge
he unfolds it reads it
then winks flirtatiously at the female juror who wrote it
back to business so
has the jury reached a verdict
stands up yes we have your honor
how do you find the defendant
on the count of manslaughter
on the count of murder in the first degree
on the count of monte cristo
a boisterous clamor in the court
the electronic signs flash good
then on the count of three lets all get the hell out of here
the jury and spectators start to rise
the judge hesitates gavel poised shooting them a warning look
everyone freezes halfway out of their seats
two and a half
he smacks his gavel
everyone scatters for the doors but judge skanky beats them out of the room
lana turns cool dropping her courtroom facade
she plucks off her earrings unbuttons the neck of her dress reaches in and magically pulls out her bra tossing it away
well counselor looks like you won another case
lucky for me
two legal aides sneak up behind ned and dump a big plastic barrel of gatorade cans over his head
system attention courtroom shoppers
all trial evidence now on sale
forty to sixty percent off all exhibits
everything must go
they turn to see spectators and jurors browse through the clutter of junk in front of the court clerk on the evidence table
an irritable woman claims the irritable man grabbing the cigar from his ear and throwing it down
i told you bernard
smoking cigars is bad for your hearing
she pulls him away as lana steps up with a cigarette dangling from her lips
lana picks up her gun and spins the cylinder
the battered court clerk limps over smiling
what can i do for ya
how much for my gun
laura sees this
turns to ned with a look of shock
i dont believe it
she just bought her gun back
the gun she used to kill a man
ned looks off toward lana with admiration
the same gun that saved my life
im sure it has sentimental value
as lana wades into the crowd of reporters some still without pants the camera moves to lola who is watching lana from the back of the courtroom
lola pulls a small cord hanging from the side of her hat
opening her veil like window drapes
shes not happy
frank lays on a mechanics creeper working under a car
lana steps between his feet
he hears her and rolls out his crotch sliding to a stop against her legs
he looks up covered with black grease
you did it
ya beat the rap
no thanks to you
he gets to his feet cocky
i knew hed spring ya
she walks toward him her voice cold accusing
he backs up
you didnt lift a finger frank
you let me take all the heat
what could i do
lana pulls the gun from her purse pointing it at him
you were gonna let me rot in the slammer
never say a thing
now were together
thats what counts
we can try again
forget triple indemnity
well whack him and split three mil
im not splitting anything frank
cocks the gun and you know too much
arrogant come on lana
youre not gonna shoot me
he brashly turns his back to her putting some tools away
she sees a huge electric powered screwdriver on the workbench next to her smiling diabolically
she lowers the gun
then seductive maybe ill just screw you to death
he laughs arrogantly
starts to unbutton his shirt
now youre talkin baby
we see lanas silhouette on the window as she raises the big power screwdriver and turns it on
whirr r r r r r r r r r
the camera whips around and pushes in to
watching the murder from her car
there is a
a police photographer takes flash pictures of the crime scene
the coroner cops forensic men
all do their thing
ned and arch amble in looking around
arch is eating nachos
watch your step guys
theres a lot of blood
throughout this scene in the b
the milling cops and investigators slip on all the blood as if on slick ice and fall out of frame their arms and legs flailing helplessly
one of the coroners investigators approaches arch and ned
looks like a suicide
we found a note
he holds up a rolled piece of paper with a pair of tweezers
ned takes it trying to unroll it
it was stuck up his nose
ned hands it off to arch who casually unrolls it
the investigator slips arms waving and falls out of frame
reading it i cant take it anymore
im a mediocre mechanic
and a lousy lover
hes sure got that right
arch gives ned a very strange look
ned feels his stare
the mechanic part i mean
in the b
various cops pair up to have their pictures taken by the police crime scene photographer
stares at the body i dont know why arch but i just cant shake this crazy hunch it wasnt suicide
behind ned on his line revealing frank
pinned to the wall by the power screwdriver stuck in his back
its still running
vibrating with a grinding hum
ned reaches out and turns the screwdriver off
ned enters pausing
he hears voices
he goes to the living room
lana and lola turn to see him in the doorway
he is shocked
lana looks shaken
but lola is cool
this is lola um
nervous defensive um
she told you her name was um
and what other lies did she tell you
ive never seen this woman in my life
never followed her home
never had sex with her in the refrigerator
its all a sick fantasy
and i deny everything
he turns to lola
when will women like you learn you cant tear apart a perfectly good marriage with your vicious lies
i sell vacuum cleaners mr
the big powerful kind that suck up everything in sight
i was just telling your wife if she wants to get rid of all her dirt she has to be willing to pay the price
she turns to lana with a cold and contemptuous glare
let me know what you decide mrs
im sure we can work out a convenient payment plan
a pleasure meeting you
as soon as the door closes lana whirls around in a fury
smashing a lamp
she shrieks furiously
he puts his arms around her comforting
i know its been a tough ordeal
with the trial and everything
tell you what
lets take a trip
just the two of us
darkly inspired i like that
just you and me
ill start packing
i got something to take care of
ill be back in awhile
he kisses her and exits
lana turns to look up toward the landing a vengefully insane smile clouding her face
a demanding knock at the door
lola hesitates at the door
who is it
the door crashes open
ned is silhouetted in the doorway
he looks really pissed
lola turns and runs
ned sprints after her leaping through the air
bringing her down with a tackle
i just want to talk
why didnt you say so
her foot shoots out smashing him right in the face
she jumps up and scrambles away
ned pursues her
she grabs a bottle of scotch from the counter spins around
would you like a drink
she throws the bottle
he ducks and it shatters on the wall
she whirls on one foot nailing him in the head with a flying spin kick
he stumbles back dazed
she grabs an ice pick
then lets get to the point
ned rolls onto his back jamming both feet into her stomach heaving her up over him
thru the air
she slams into the wall
then slowly turns
still cool and collected
she raises a cigarette
lights it with the ice pick lighter
so whats your problem tough guy
stay away from my life my wife my home and my pets
im taking lana on a vacation and when i come back i dont ever want to see your face again
he shoves her against the wall
the cigarette flying away
shocked a vacation
she doesnt deserve a vacation
shes a brat
a bad girl
she always was and always will be
he grabs her by the shoulders shaking her
what are you talking about
you dont know anything about lana
i know everything
shakes her hard how do you know her
who is she to you
she clams up
he slaps her
who is she
shes your wife
slaps her again
who is she
shes my sister
slaps her again liar
who is she
shes your wife
he raises his hand to slap her hard
she slaps him
shes my sister
she continues to slap him
back and forth
repeating her answers
shes your wife
shes my sister
he reaches a boiling point raising two fingers preparing to give her the three stooges two fingered eye poke
she blocks it with her hand and shoves him away
then she executes a perfect three stooges wiggly hand head slap telling him
shes your wife
and my sister
ned is stunned
music thunders dramatically
lana clicks the stereo off
the music stops
she was spoiled rotten
she stole everything i ever had
the boys gym teacher
he was older
he smelled like dirty sweat socks and old basketballs
and he was all mine
turning bitter but lana wasnt satisfied with her own things
she had to have mine too
she took it all
my makeup my sweaters my shoes my underwear
you wore the same clothes
we were identical twins
whatre you talking about
you two dont look anything alike
one day i caught her stealing my lavender eye shadow and she smashed my face in with a shovel
i had fifty three operations
when the doctors were finished with me
i looked like this
dont lie to me
they did a terrific job
i look in the mirror
i can see
tell that to dwayne
when he saw my face he left me for her
because she looked more like me than i did
first she stole my looks
then she stole the only man who ever loved me
she comes toward him
feeling in control once more
but i found a way to get even
the best revenge possible
destroy her marriage
thats why you did all this
the phone calls
you been hangin out with dick tracy havent ya
it wont work
lana loves me
it doesnt matter
im blackmailing her for everything shes worth
she murdered that greasy auto mechanic
i saw her do it
stunned lana killed frank kelbo
also stunned kelbo
his name was kelbo
did he burn you on car repairs too
dwaynes name was kelbo
he had a son
ned wanders to his car climbs in sits there
the pieces of the puzzle were falling into place and i didnt like the picture they were making
if lana really killed frank kelbo then i had misjudged her by a mile
he was a lousy mechanic
ned rubs his temples shuts his eyes
it was all starting to give me a headache bigger than the national deficit
in a gadda da vida plays on the stereo
lola sits on the floor by an end table eyes dazed staring blankly
a lamp with a clapper switch sits on the table
as the camera moves in slowly to her she absently claps the light off
close on female hands using a keyhole saw to cut through a railing on the second floor landing above the foyer
the sound of a car
the sawing stops
ned pulls up
the house is dark and ominous
so is the music
the front door is open a crack
he cautiously pushes it and the door cr e a k s open very slowly
the door stops but the loud creaking continues
ned touches it lightly with the tip of his finger
the creaking stops
ned moves up the stairs
the camera booms up with him holding on an ecu of the partially severed railing
hot water gushes from the faucet into a clawfoot bathtub
he turns the water off looking around puzzled
loosens his tie rubs his head
a splitting headache
opens the medicine cabinet and
a cat leaps out
theres a noise from downstairs
someone is pounding on the door
ned enters and opens it
im glad youre here
i have so much to tell you
come on in
ill make some tea
grab a chair
i brought my own
she drags a chair in behind her sits at the kitchen table
ned puts a kettle on the burner turns it on
he starts searching through the cupboard for teabags
what have you got
a lottery ticket and a laundry receipt
lays them on table i found them in the pocket of that suit you wore the night you were working under cover with a client
ned freezes staring out the window unable to face her
you remember that night dont ya ned
then it hit me
lottery starts with l o
laundry starts with l a
ned turns to her when he hears lolas name
looking baffled by this convoluted piece of logic
shrugs it off dont sweat it
its the way a womans mind works
he turns back to the cupboard picking up a container
how about ovaltine
then i remembered you told me some guy named frank had been working on your wifes car for two months
you with me so far
im way ahead of you
he brings the ovaltine container to the table
well back it up
you probably took a wrong turn
remember your insurance policy
the one we couldnt find
i started thinking who else had access to it beside you and me
the answer came up
and since shes a woman its probably hidden right here
a huge ceramic cookie jar sits on the table in front of them
laura smashes it with her fist breaking it open
cookies spill out
and the insurance policy
so thats where she hid the oreos
he sits down
starts eating oreos
twisting them apart
ned lana wasnt trying to save your life when she shot max shady
she and frank were plotting to kill you and collect on your insurance policy
but she shot the wrong guy
thats the craziest thing i ever heard
she presses on dont you see
frank was going to let her take the fall
so she murdered him and tried to make it look like suicide
beat thats when i realized there was a connection between lola and lana
well hang on to your jock strap ned
she unrolls a complex genealogical chart
walks him thru it
not only is franks father dwayne kelbo notoriously amorous gym teacher and lola cains former lover
franks mother is helen shady
max and frank are half brothers who never met
laura pauses dramatically then announces
your lovely wife lana murdered both of helen shadys sons
this is so unbelievable
and you havent even heard my story
the keyhole saw cuts through the railing
the camera reveals lana eyes filled with machiavellian rage
she enters the bathroom lays the saw blade down
a pair of hands plunge into frame grabbing her by the throat
we go with her as she is pushed back into the tub the hands forcing her head under water
lana grabs a diving mask clamps it over her face
one of the attacking hands rips it away
lana grabs a snorkel sticking it in her mouth
the hand pulls it from her tossing it aside
the hand shoves a little rubber duckie into lanas mouth
lana struggles finally going limp
her open eyes stare up from beneath the water
the last few bubbles rise to the surface
he turned into a monster
and thats when i left him
i just couldnt
the tea kettle whistles
laura pulls it off the burner
the whistling subsides
replaced by the distant sound of water running upstairs
ned cocks his head listening
that damn faucet keeps turning on all by itself
ill go check it
ill make the ovaltine
laura opens the ovaltine container
a dark shadow moves past the window behind laura
laura opens the cupboard
pigeons explode out wings beating furiously
she catches her breath looks in the cupboard
the cans and boxes are covered with pigeon shit
she shoves them aside looking for the ovaltine
ned looks up toward the light from the bathroom
water seeps over the edge of the landing and down the steps
as he moves up the steps the sound of music
the familiar strains of in a gadda da vida
grows louder and louder
its filled with steam
he waves the steam away
startled to see lanas lifeless body beneath the water the rubber duckie jammed into her mouth
the tub overflows on the floor
he turns the faucet off
the water stops
and so does the music
puzzled he turns the faucet on
the music starts
turns it off
the music stops
as laura turns away to enter the pantry
her husbands twisted face suddenly appears in the kitchen window
the music is coming from the closet
ned yanks the door open
a flock of pigeons bursts out
revealing a guest musician playing an instrument
im sittin in for dizzy
he had a gig tonight
ned shuts the door eyes shifting
lola must be near
laura searches the large walk in pantry for tea bags
she hears a loud crash of breaking glass in the kitchen
stops and listens
then casually shrugs it off
lauras husband stands in the kitchen
the back door is open
the window shattered
the kitchen towels hanging sloppily on the rack
the disorganized clutter of cans and boxes in the cupboard
we push in to his wildly insane eyes
as ned enters the upstairs landing we hear voices in his mind
women are an open book
you can always tell the rotten apples from the peaches
id stake my career on it
stake my career on it
stake my career on it
the repetitive echo gets to him
he smacks his head with the palm of his hand
the skipping stops
if anyone ever proves me wrong ill throw away my badge
a womans hand unrolls a leather kit
the u pick an ice pick porta pik pak
with seven ice picks in separate slots each labeled with a day of the week
the hand selects wednesdays ice pick pulls it out
it chimes loudly
its twelve midnight
returns the ice pick to its slot selects the one for thursday
laura comes out of the pantry
everything in the cupboard is neatly stacked
all the towels are straight
she whirls around
coming face to face with her husband
he smiles demonically holding up the ninja turtle float ring
forget something sweetheart
ned nears the bathroom door and suddenly
a piercing scream
lola charges an ice pick raised over her head
she knocks him backward into the bathroom slashing at him
but he deflects the attack grabbing at her arms
laura backs away from her husband
he holds her wedding ring
you forgot to flush darling
as ned and lola continue their violent struggle
lola grabs toiletries to aid in her attack
she squirts ned with shaving cream
squeezes toothpaste in his hair
and throws bath powder in his face
ned is blinded
gaining the advantage lola shoves him back slamming his head into the wall
hes dazed helpless
lola raises the ice pick moving forward to strike
but ned grabs a hair blower and swings it around pointing it at her like a gun
then smiles contemptuously
whatre you gonna do ned
blow me away
she laughs arrogantly
ned clicks on the hair blower to high a blast of hot air hitting lolas face puffing her cheeks out pushing her back hair flying wildly
her backside hits the railing where lana has cut it
the wood splintering
lola tumbles over backward screaming
she hangs suspended in mid air for a moment like a cartoon character arms flailing
she falls to the marble floor below hitting with a loud thud
lauras husband hears lola fall turning
laura grabs the iron skillet and clobbers him with it
he goes down
i never forget anything
ned stares at the hair blower in his hand
filled with disgust and revulsion he throws the weapon down
laura pulls two revolvers from her purse
spinning them like john wayne
expertly tossing one over her back catching it in front
she heads for the foyer
laura pauses looks down at lolas body
she pushes lolas skirt a bit higher with the toe of her shoe
outraged those are my panties
she looks up
sees a light emanating from the bathroom
laura moves through the shadows
stops outside the bathroom pressing her back against the wall guns up and ready
she swivels into the doorway
taking a shooters stance
submerged in the tub face up the rubber duckie in her mouth
laura steps back and turns
right into a thing covered in white
startled she shrieks
ned drops the white towel hes using to wipe off all of the shaving cream and toothpaste
relieved to see its ned she throws her arms around him
you were right
theres a million things i dont know about women
maybe you can teach me a few hundred
he pulls out his police badge looks at it
i had too many careers anyway
he tosses it away over the railing
the badge drops from above landing on the floor right in front of lolas lifeless face
her eyes pop open
suddenly the rubber duckie pops to the surface
laura hugs ned again arms locked around his neck still gripping a gun in each hand
oh ned i love you
i always loved you
lola sits bolt upright bloody but still bouncy
lana suddenly sits up in the tub inhaling a huge gasp of air her eyes wild
lauras husbands eyes pop open
he sits up suddenly
smashing his head into the sharp corner of the kitchen table
he topples back slowly
lolas feet move steadily up each stair
her bloody hand grasping the ice pick
lanas feet step out of the tub water dripping all around
she picks up the pointed saw from the floor
ned and laura still embrace her forearms crisscrossed behind his neck
its been a long embrace
suddenly lana and lola both appear screaming like banshees
lana charges from the bathroom grasping the sharp saw blade
lola races at them from the stairway
with the ice pick
without missing a beat laura raises the barrels of both guns and fires at them simultaneously
right next to neds ears
the impact of one bullet knocks lana all the way back through the bathroom crashing spectacularly out the window
the other bullet sends lola flipping down the staircase
ned looks stunned his eyes crossed
the thundering gunshots still ringing in his ears
laura proudly blows the gunsmoke away from the end of each barrel
deafened i said
i got em
yells he strains to make out what shes saying ears still ringing
yells back a beat
laura opens her mouth to correct him then decides against it
speaking softly almost shyly
but i want to have kids
he hears this
smiles at her
we move in slowly toward the house
maybe i was wrong
maybe women really are like a big jigsaw puzzle
with pieces that never seem to fit where you want em to
ned and laura are in bed wrapped in each others arms
all i know is there are three things that men cant possibly ever do
revealing that its not voice over narration
ned is actually rattling on aloud again
and program a vcr
and giving birth is the easy one
knock off the chatter will ya
he smiles at her
romantic saxaphone music begins to play
only this time its lauras theme
the camera pulls back slowly
revealing dizzy laying on the bed beside them
playing the sax
after a beat laura turns to dizzy
we wont need you anymore
ned casually slips him a twenty dollar bill
dizzy slips off the bed and out the door
laura turns to ned
we can make our own music
her hand reaches slowly over the edge of the bed toward the floor
she comes up with a concertina a small accordian
and begins to play it
ned lays there listening for a few moments a stunned look frozen on his face
he reaches under the pillow and pulls out a harmonica and joins in
the camera booms up to a high angle shot
as they play medley of all the music heard in the film
after the final credit we hear ned do you know
i want you to make love to me all night long
but if you hum a few bars
ill fake it
