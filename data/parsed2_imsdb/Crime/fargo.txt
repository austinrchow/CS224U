b if window
href b b a screenplay by ethan coen and joel coen the following text fades in over black this is a true story
the events depicted in this film took place in minnesota in
at the request of the survivors the names have been changed
out of respect for the dead the rest has been told exactly as it occured
slowly the white becomes a barely perceptible image white particles wave over a white background
a car bursts through the curtain of snow
the car is equipped with a hitch and is towing another car a brand new light brown cutlass ciera with the pink sales sticker showing in its rear window
as the car roars past leaving snow swirling in their dirft the title of the film fades in
green highway signs point the way to moorehead minnesota fargo north dakota
the roads for the two cities diverge
a sign says welcome to north dakota and another just after says now entering fargo nd pop
the car pulls into a rodeway inn
a man in his early forties balding and starting to paunch goes to the reception desk
the clerk is an older woman
and how are you today sir
real good now
im checking in mr
the man prints jerry lundega onto a registration card then hastily crosses out the last name and starts to print anderson
as she types into a computer okay mr
anderson and youre still planning on staying with us just the night then
the man turns on the tv which shows the local evening news
whether they will go to summer camp at all
katie jensen has more
it was supposed to be a project funded by the city council it was supposed to benefit those fargo moorehead children who would otherwise not be able to afford to
attend a lakeshore summer camp
but nobody consulted city controller stu jacobson
anderson sits alone at a table finishing dinner
a middle aged waitress approaches holding a pot of regular coffee in one hand and decaf in the other
can i warm that up for ya there
the man looks at his watch
we are pulling into the snowswept parking lot of a one story brick building
broken neon at the top of the building identifies it as the jolly troll tavern
a troll also in neon holds a champagne glass aloft
the bar is downscale even for this town
country music plays on the jukebox
two men are seated in a booth at the back
one is short slight youngish
the other man is somewhat older and dour
the table in front of them is littered with empty long neck beer bottles
the ashtray is full
im uh jerry lundegaard youre jerry lundegaard

a black like curls through the white
twisting perspective shows that it is an aerial shot of a two lane highway bordered by snowfields
the highway carries one moving car
carl showalter is driving

a morning show host in an apron stands behind a counter on a kitchen set
so i seperate the how the heck do i get the egg out of the shell without breaking it
jean lundegaard is curled up on the couch with a cup of coffee watching the television
you just prick a little hole in the end and blow
jean smiles as we hear laughter and applause from the studio audience
she hears something else a faint scraping sound and looks up
okay here goes nothing
the scraping sound persists
jean sets down her coffee cup and rises
from the studio audience awoooo
we track toward the back door
a curtain is stretched tight across its window
jean pulls the curtain back
bright sunlight amplified by snow floods in
a man in an orange ski mask looks up from the lock
jean gasps drops the curtain rutns and runs into a taller man also in a ski mask already in the house
we hear the crack of the back door window being smashed
the tall man gaear grimsrud grabs jeans wrist
she screams staring at her own imprisoned wrist then wraps her gaping mouth around grimsruds gloved thumb and bites down hard
he drops her wrist
as carl enters she races up the stairs
grimsurd looks at his thumb
as the two men enter a door at the far side is slamming shut
a cord snakes in under the door
jean sobbing frantically pushes at buttons on the princess phone
the phone pops out of her hands jangles across the tile floor smashes against the door and then bounces away its cord ripped free
with a groaning sound the door shifts in its frame
grimsrud has a crowbar jammed in between the bathroom door and frame and is working it
jean crosses to a high window above the toilet and throws it open
snow that had drifted against the window sifts lightly in
jean steps up onto the toilet
the door creaks moving as one piece in its frame
jean glances back as she steps up from the toilet seat to the tank
the groaning of the door ends with the wood around its knob splintering and the knob itself falling out onto the floor
the door swings open
grimsrud and carl enter
room empty window open
carl strides to the window and hoists himself out
grimsrud opens the medicine cabinet and delicately taps aside various bottles and tubes seeking the proper unguent
he finds a salve but after a moment sets it down noticing something in the mirror
the shower curtain is drawn around the tub
he steps toward it
as he reaches for the curtain it explodes outward animated by thrashing limbs
jean screaming tangled in the curtain rips it off its rings and stumbles out into the bedroom
jean rushes toward the door cloaked by the shower curtain but awkwardly trying to push it off
still thrashing jean crashes against the upstairs railing trips on the curtain and falls thumping crazily down the stairs
grimsrud trots down after her
wade sits behind his desk another man rises as jerry enters
how ya doin there stan

stan grossman shakes his hand
good to see ya again jerry
if these numbers are right this looks pretty sweet
oh those numbers are all right bleemee

i assume if youre not innarested you wont mind if we move on it independently
we are high and wide on the office buildings parking lot
jerry emerges wrapped in a parka his arms sticking stiffly out at his sides his breath vaporizing
he goes to his car opens its front door pulls out a red plastic scraper and starts methodically scraping off the thin crust of ice that has developed on his
the scrape scrape scrape sound carries in the frigid air
jerry goes into a frenzy banging the scraper against the windshield and the hood of his car
the tantrum passes
jerry stands pantin staring at nothing in particular
scrape scrape scrape he goes back to work on the windshield
a beat silent but for a key scraping at the lock
the door swings open and jerry edges in looking about holding a sack of groceries
he shuts the door
got the growshries
he has already seen the shower curtain on the floor
he frowns pokes at it with his foot
jerry walks in
he sets the groceries down on the toilet tank
he looks at the open window through which snow still sifts in
he shuts it
he picks up the small tube of uguent that sits on the sink frowns at it puts it back in the medicine chest
he looks at the shower curtain rod holding empty rings
once again we are looking at the rumpled shower curtain
from another room yah wade i its jerry i
then slightly more agitated
yah wade its i its jerry
wade its jerry i we gotta talk wade its terrible
jerry stands in wide shot hands on hips looking down at a telephone
after a motionless beat he picks up the phone and punches in a number
yah wade gustafson please
hold in black
a slow tilt down from night sky brings the head of a large paper mache figure into frame
it is a flannel shirt woodsman carrying a double edged ax over one shoulder
as we hear the rumble of an approaching car the continuing tilt and boom down brings us down the woodsmans body to a pedestal
a sweep of headlights illuminates a sign on the pedestal the headlights sweep off and a car hums past and on into the background
the two lane highway is otherwise empty
grimsrud smokes and gazes out the window
from the back seat we hear whimpering
grimsrud turns to look
jean lies bound and curled on the back seat underneath a tarpaulin
shut the fuck up or ill throw you back in the trunk you know
thats moren ive heard you say all week
grimsrud stares at him then turns back to the window
at a loud whoop carl starts and looks back out the rear window
fifty yards behind a state trooper has turned on his gumballs
carl eases the car onto the shoulder
ah shit the tags
grimsrud looks at him
its just the tags
i never put my tags on the car
dont worry ill take care of this
he looks into the back seat as the car bounces and slows on the gravel shoulder
lets keep still back there lady or were gonna have to ya know to shoot ya
grimsrud stares at carl
ill take care of this
both cars have stopped
carl looks up at the rear view mirror
the trooper is stopped on the shoulder just behind them writing in his citation book
we hear the troopers door open
the trooper walks up the shoulder one hand resting lightly on top of his holster his breath steaming in the cold night air
carl opens his window as the trooper draws up
how can i help you officer
the trooper scans the inside of the car taking his time
grimsrud smokes and gazes calmly out his window
finally this is a new car then sir
it certainly is officer
still got that smell
youre required to display temporary tags either in the plate area or taped inside the back window
certainly can i see your license and registration please
he reaches for his wallet
i was gonna tape up the temporary tag ya know to be in full compliance but it uh it uh
must a slipped my mind
he extends his wallet toward the trooper a folded fifty dollar bill protruding from it
so maybe the best thing would be to take care of that right here in brainerd
whats this sir
thats my license and regis tration
i wanna be in compliance
he forces a laugh
i was just thinking i could take care of it right here
the policeman thoughtfully pats the fifty into the billfold and hands the billfold back into the car
put that back in your pocket please
carls nervous smile fades
and step out of the car please sir
grimsrud smiling thinly shakes his head
there is a whimpering sound
the policeman hesitates
the policeman leans forward into the car listening
grimsrud reaches across carl grabs the trooper by the hair and slams his head down onto the car door
the policeman grunts digs awkwardly for footing outside and throws an arm for balance against the outside of the car
with his free hand grimsrud pops the glove compartment
he brings a gun out and reaches across carl and shoots bang into the back of the troopers head
he releases the policeman
the policemans head slides out the window and his body flops back onto the street
carl looks out at the cop in the road
grimsrud takes the troopers hat off of carls lap and sails it out the open window
youll take care of it
boy you are smooth smooth you know
jean for some reason screams again
clear him off the road
he gets out
carl leans down to hoist up the body
headlights appear an oncoming car
the car approaches slowing
carl with the troopers body hoisted halfway up is frozen in the headlights
the car accelerates and roars past and away
we just make out the silhouettes of two occupants in front
grimsrud slides into the drivers seat
he squeals into a u turn the drivers door slamming shut with his spin
small red tail lights fishtail up ahead
the pursued car churns up fine snow
grimsrud takes the cigarette from his mouth and stubs it in his ashtray
we hear the churning of the car wheels and the pinging of snow clods and salt on the cars underside
in the back seat jean starts screaming
grimsrud is not gaining on the tail lights
he fights with the wheel as his car swims on the road face
the red tail lights ahead start to turn
with a distant crunching sound they disappear
the headlights now show only empty road starting to turn
grimsrud frowns and slows
his headlights show the car up ahead off the road crumpled around a telephone pole having failed to hold a turn
jean slides off the back seat and thumps into the legwell
grimsrud sweeps his gun off the front seat throws open his door and gets out
the wrecked cars headlights shine off into a snowfield abutting the highway
a young man in a down parka is limping across the snowfield away from the wrecked car
grimsrud strides calmly out after the injured boy
he raises his gun and fires
with a poof of feathers a hole opens up in the boys back and he pitches into the snow
grimsrud walks up to the wreck and peers in its half open door
a young woman is trapped inside the twisted wreckage injured
snow swirls in the headlights of the wreck
grimsrud raises his gun and fires
a blue winged teal in flight over a swampy marshland
the room in which it hangs is dark
we hear off screen snoring
we track off to reveal an easel upon which we see a half completed oil of a grey mallard
the continuing track reveals a couple in bed sleeping
the man fortyish pajama clad is big and big bellied
his mouth is agape
his arms are flung over a woman in her thirties wearing a nightie mouth also open not snoring
we hold for a long beat on their regular breathing and snoring
the phone rings
the woman stirs
she reaches for the phone
hi its marge
the man stirs and clears his throat with a long deep rumble
the man sits up gazes stupidly about
there in a jif
real good then
she hangs up
you can sleep hon
its early yet
the man swings his legs out
ill fix ya some eggs
thats okay hon
i gotta run
gotta eat a breakfast marge
ill fix ya some eggs
aw you can sleep hon
ya gotta eat a breakfast
he clears his throat with another deep rumble
ill fix ya some eggs
leavings of a huge plate of eggs ham toast
wider we see marge now wearing a beige police uniform
a patch on one arm says brainerd police department
she wears a heavy belt holding a revolver walkie talkie and various other jangling police impedimenta
norm is in a dressing gown
time to shove off
love ya margie
as she struggles into a parka love ya hon
he is exiting back to the bedroom she exits out the front door
marge is making her way down the icy front stoop to her prowler
norm sits back onto the bed shrugging off his robe
off screen we hear the front door open
marge stamps the snow off her shoes
prowler needs a jump
two police cars and an ambulance sit idling at the side of the road a pair of men inside each car
the first cars driver door opens and a figure in a parka emerges holding two styrofoam cups
his partner leans across the seat to close the door after him
the reverse shows marge approaching from her own squad car
thought you might need a little warm up
he hands her one of the cups of coffee
yah thanks a bunch
so whats the deal now
gary says triple homicide
yah looks pretty bad
two ofmre over here
marge looks around as they start walking
where is everybody
well its cold margie
laid out in the early morning light is the wrecked car a pair of footprints leading out to a man in a bright orange parka face down in the bloodstained
snow and one pair of footsteps leading back to the road
marge is peering into the car
heres the second one
its in the head and the
hand there i guess thats a defensive wound
marge looks up from the car
wheres the state trooper
lou up on the shoulder jerks his thumb
back there a good piece
in the ditch next to his prowler
marge looks around at the road
okay so we got a state trooper pulls someone over we got a shooting and these folks drive by and we got a high speed pursuit ends here and this
execution type deal
id be very surprised if our suspect was from brainerd
marge is studying the ground
and ill tell you what from his footprints he looks like a big fella marge suddenly doubles over putting her head between her knees down near the snow
ya see something down there chief
uh i just i think im gonna barf
geez you okay margie

she gets up sweeping snow from her knees
well that passed

marges prowler is parked nearby
marge is on her hands and knees by a body down in the ditch again looking at footprints in the snow
she calls up to the road theres two of em lou
yah this guys smaller than his buddy
in the foreground is the head of the state trooper facing us
peering at it from behind still on her hands and knees is marge
for petes sake
she gets up clapping the snow off her hands and climbs out of the ditch
hows it look marge
well hes got his gun on his hip there and he looks like a nice enough guy
its a real shame

she is looking at the prowler which still idles on the shoulder

marge is driving lou sits next to her

yah i think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates
lou gazes out the window thinking
say lou ya hear the one about the guy who couldnt afford personalized plates so he went and changed his name to j l
yah thats a good one
the police car enters with a whoosh and hums down a straight ruled empty highway cutting a landscape of flat and perfect white
jerry wade and stan grossman sit in a booth sipping coffee
outside the window snow falls from a gunmetal sky

scotty starts to weep again
jerry stares down at his lap
thats the best we can do here
it is a lakeside cabin surrounded by white
a brown ciera with dealer plates is pulling into the drive
grimsrud climbs out of the passenger seat as carl climbs out of the drivers
grimsrud opens the back door and with an arm on her elbow helps jean out
she has her hands tied behind her and a black hood over her head
with a cry she swings her elbow out of grimsruds grasp and lurches away across the front lawn
grimsrud moves to retrieve her but carl grinning lays a hand on his shoulder
they both look out at the front lawn grimsrud expressionless carl smiling
with muffled cries the hooded woman lurches across the unbroken snow staggering this way and that stumbling on the uneven terrain
she stops stands still her hooded head swaying
she lurches out in an arbitrary direction
going downhill she reels staggers and falls face first into the snow weeping
ha ha ha ha ha ha
grimsrud still expressionless breaks away from carls restraining hand to retrieve her
we track behind marge as she makes her way across the floor greeting various officers
she holds a small half full paper sack
beyond her we see a small glassed in cublcle
norm sits at the desk inside with a box lunch spread out in front of him
there is lettering on the cubicles glass door brainerd marge enters and sits behind the desk detaching her walkie talkie from her utility belt to accomodate the seat
she slides the paper sack toward him

he looks inside
the bottom of the sack is full of fat crawling earthworms

owner was on the desk then said these two guys had company
marges prowler is parked in an otherwise empty lot
snow drifts down
marge sits talking with two young women at one end of an elevated dance platform
the club not yet open for business is deserted
where you girls from

a subconscious type thing
yah that can happen
they said they were goin to the twin cities
is that useful to ya
oh you bet yah
it is now dusk
the brown ciera with dealer plates still sits in the drive
we track in on jean lundegaard who sits tied in a chair with the black hood still over her head
as we track in we hear inarticulate cursing intermittent banging and loud static
we track in on gaear grimsrud who sits smoking a cigarette and expressionlessly gazing offscreen
we track in on carl showalter who stands over an old black and white television
it plays nothing but snow
carl is banging on it as he mutters days
be here for days with a dammit
a goddamn mute
nothin to do
and the fucking each dammit brings a pound of his fist on the tv
tv doesnt even
plug me in man
gimmee a dammit
plug me into the ozone baby
plug me into the ozone fuck
with one last bang we cut in extreme close up an insect is lugging a worm
the bark beetle carries the worm to the nest
where it will feed its young for up to six weeks
a pull back from the screen reveals that we are in marges house
marge and norm are watching television in bed
from the tv we hear insects chirring
after a long beat silence except for the tv marge murmurs still looking at the set well im turnin in norm
also looking at the tv oh yah
marge rolls over and norm continues to watch
a snowflake drops through the black
it starts snowing
the lone traffic light blinks slowly steadily red
snow sifts down
there is no other movement
we are looking up at the bottom lit statue
snow drops away
the bedroom is dark
norm is snoring
the phone rings
marge gropes in the dark

we are looking at jerrys cubicle from across the showroom
noise muted by distance we watch jerry slam down the reciever rise to his feet fling the phone to the floor raise his desk blotter high over his head with
pens and pencils rolling off it and slam it onto his desktop
he stands for a moment hands on hips glaring
he stoops and picks up the phone places it back on the desktop starts picking up the pens and pencils
on steam table bins of food each identified by a plaque a complementary track shows two rays being pushed along a buffet line piled high with many foods
they sit next to each other at a long cafateria style formica table silently eating
a hip with a hissing walkie talkie enters frame

norm who has been eating steadily throughout looks over at marge with mild interest
he stares for a beat as he finishes chewing and them swallows and says oh yah
jerry wade and stan grossman sit around the kitchen table
it is night
the scene is harshly toplit by a hanging fixture
on the table are the remains of coffee and a cinammon filbert ring
i wanna be a part a this thing

through a windshield we see a sign for the minneapolis the brown ciera enters and drives lazy s curves around the few snow covered cars parked on the roof of
it stops by one car and carl emerges
he quickly scans the lot then kneels in the snow at the back of the parked car and starts unscrewing its license plate
carl pulls up and hands the attendant his ticket
yeah i decided not to park here
the attendant frowns uncomprehendingly at the ticket
what do you mean you decided not to park here
yeah i just came in

the attendant is still puzzled
im sorry sir but i decided not to im uh not taking the trip as it turns out
im sorry sir we do have to charge you the four dollars

he is peeling off one dollar bills
you know these are the limits of your life man
ruler of your little fucking gate here

jerry is staring up mouth agape at the underside of a car on a hydraulic lift
bewildered he looks about then asks a mechanic passing by his voice raised over the din of the shop
the mechanic points
talkin to a cop
marge and shep face each other at the other end of the floor in a grimy and cluttered glassed in cubicle
said she was a policewoman
marge and shep silently talk
jerry stares swallows
shep is shaking his head
well you do reside their at fremont terrace
anyone else residing there
proudfoot this call came in past three in the morning
its just hard for me to believe you cant remember anyone calling
shep says nothing
now i know youve had some problems struggling with the narcotics some other entanglements currently on parole so
well associating with criminals if youre the one they talked to that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in stillwater
now i saw some rough stuff on your priors but nothing in the nature of a homicide
shep stares at her
i know you dont want to be an accessory to something like that
so you think you might remember who those folks were who called ya
jerry is worriedly pacing behind his desk
at a noise he looks up
marge has stuck her head in the door
i wonder if i could take just a minute of your time here what
what is it all about
do you mind if i sit down im carrying quite a load here
marge plops into the chair opposite him
youre the owner here mr
executive sales manager

well im a police officer from up brainerd investigating some malfeasance and i was just wondering if youve had any new vehicles stolen off the lot in the past couple

home a paul bunyan and babe the blue ox
babe the blue ox
yah ya know weve got the big statue there
so you havent had any vehicles go missing then
okey dokey thanks a bunch
ill let you get back to your paperwork then
as marge rises jerry looks blankly down at the papers on the desk in front of him
he looks up at marges retreating back
he looks back down at the papers
he looks over at the phone
he picks up the phone and dials four digits
yah gimmee shep
the heck dya mean
well whered he go
no i dont need a mechanic oh geez i gotta talk to a friend of his so uh

she looks around the bar a rather characterless lowlit meeting place for business people
it is a bald paunching man of about marges age rising from a booth halfway back
his features are broad friendly asian american
he approaches somewhat carefully as if on his second drink
they hug and head back toward the booth

carl showalter is sitting at a small table with a tarty looking blonde in a low cut gown
each holds a drink
just in town on business
just in and out
a little of the old in and out
carl looks around
have ya been to the celebrity room before
with other uh clients
i dont think so
yeah well it depends on the artist

the reverse shows a disappearing waiter and the backs of many many people sitting at tables between us and the very distant stage
jose feliciano very small performs on a spotlit stool
the acoustics are poor
what is he deaf
so uh how long have you been with the escort service

carl is humping the escort
we hear the door burst open
the escort is grabbed and flung out of bed

jesus ch shep slaps him hard forehand backhand
fuck out of my house
he hauls him up shep

carl hits a sofa and we see his bare legs disappear as he flips back over it
shep enters frame to circle the sofa and kick at carl behind it
fuck outta here

little fucking shit
there is a knock at the door
come on in there
shep strides to the door flings it open
a man in boxer shorts stands in the doorway
cmon brother its late unghh
shep hits him twice then grabs both of his ears and starts banging his head against the wall
the hooker runs by clutching her clothes and shep kicks her in the ass as she passes
he spins and goes back into the apartment
carl is hopping desperately into his pants
stay away from me man
smoke a fuckin peace pipe man
dont you dare fuckin unghh
after hitting him several times shep yanks carls belt out of his dangling pants and strangles him with it
shep knees carl repeatedly then dumps him onto the floor and starts whipping him with the buckle end of the belt
carl listens to the phone ring at the other end
his face is deeply bruised and cut
finally through the phone
all right jerry im through fucking around

jerry is at the kitchen phone
through the door to the dining room we see wade picking up an extension
yah i got the money but uh dont you fucking but me jerry

yah well you stay away from scotty now okay real good then
the line goes dead
a door slams offscreen
wade briefcase in hand gets into his cadillac slams the door and peels out
wades jaw works as he glares out at traffic
he mumbles to himself as he drives
heres your damn money now wheres my daughter
wheres my damn daughter
he pulls out a gun cracks the barrel peers in

jerry sits in the foyer trying to pull on pair of galoshes
scottys voice comes from upstairs dad
its okay scotty
wherere you going
be back in a minute
if stan calls you just tell him i went to embers
oh geez thunk
his first boot goes on
marge sits on the bed in her hotel room shoes off massaging her feet
the phone is pressed to her ear and through it we hear ringing
it is late evening blowing storm
a leisurely pan across the bleak gray expanse finds a little hut in the middle of the frozen lake with a pickup truck parked next to it
norm has a cellular phone to his ear
his feet are stretched out to an electric heater
the interior is bathed in soft orange light
hows the hotel
oh pretty good
yeah couple a muskies

so its nice up there
yah its good
no pike yet but its good
the top open level
a car sits idling
another car pulls onto the roof
it creeps over to the parked car and stops
it continues to idle as its door opens and wade steps out carrying the briefcase
the door of the other car bangs open and carl bounces out
who the fuck are you
who the fuck are you

he pulls out a gun and fires into wades gut
is this a fucking joke
he is on the pavement clutching at his gut
you fucking imbeciles
he bends down next to wade to pick up the briefcase
oh for christ
wade brings out his gun and fires at carls head close by
carl stumbles and falls back and then stands up again
his jaw is gouting blood
one hand pressed to his jaw he fires down at wade several times
blood streams through the hand pressed to his jaw
he fnkem shop me
he pockets the gun picks up the briefcase one handed flings it into his car gets in peels out
carl screams down the ramp
he takes a corner at high speed and swerves just missing jerry in his olds on his way to the top
jerry recovers from the near miss and continues up
carl squeals to a halt at the gate still pressing his hand to his bleeding jaw
ophhem ma fuchem gaphe
may i have your ticket please
jerry pulls to a halt next to wades idling cadillac
he gets out and walks slowly to wades body prostrate in the swirling snow
he bends down picks wade up by the armpits and drags him over to the back of the cadillac
he drops wades body walks to the drivers side of the car pulls the keys and walks back to pop the trunk
he wrestles wades body into the trunk slams it shut and walks back to the scene of the shooting
he kicks at the snow with his galoshed feet trying to hide the fresh bloodstains
jerry approaches in the cadillac
the wooden gate barring the exit has been broken away
the booth is empty
jerry eases toward the street looking over at the booth as he passes
inside the booth we see the awkwardly angled leg of a prostrate body
the car pulls into the driveway
jerry enters and sits on the foyer chair to take off his galoshes
stan grossman called
is everything okay
thoonk the first boot comes off
are you calling stan
im goin ta bed now
carl mumbles as he drives underlit by the dim dash lights one hand now holding a piece of rag to his shredded jaw
carls car roars into frame violently swirling the snow
its red tail lights fishtail away
it is a starky sunny day
we are cruising down a street of humble lookalike houses
we pan right as we draw toward one house in particular
in its driveway a man in a hooded parka shovels snow
he notices the approaching car and gives its driver a wave
the driver is gary the brainderd police officer
he gives a finger to the head salute and pulls over
gary slams his door shut and the other man plants his shovel in the snow
how ya doin
yah right o
the two men caucus the driveway without shaking hands and without standing particularly close
they stand stiffly arms down at their sides and breath streaming out of their parka hoods
each has an awkward leaning away posture head drawn slightly back and chin tucked in to keep his face from protruding into the cold
so im tendin bar there at ecklund swedlins last tuesday and this little guys drinkin and he says so where can a guy find some action im goin crazy down
there at the lake
and i says what kinda action
and he says woman action what do i look like and i says well what do i look like i dont arrange that kinda thing and he says im goin
crazy out there at the lake and i says well this aint that kinda place
so he says so i get it so you think im some kinda jerk for askin only he doesnt use the word jerk
and then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now
so i dont say nothin and he says what do ya think about that
so i says well that dont sound like too good a deal for him then
ya got that right
and he says yah that guys dead and i dont mean a old age
and then he says geez im goin crazy out there at the lake

just a general way
okay well thanks a bunch mr
youre right its probably nothin but thanks for callin her in
they say shes gonna turn cold tomorrow
yah got a front movin in
ya got that right
in his car now parked one hand holding the rag pressed to his mangled jaw
he is staring down at something in the front seat next to him
his other hand holds open the briefcase
it has money inside a lot of money
carl unfreezes takes out one of the bank wrapped wads and looks at it
he paws through the money in the briefcase to get a feeling for the amount
jeshush fuchem shrist
excited he counts out a bundle of bills and tosses it onto the back seat
he starts to take the rag away from his chin but the layer pressed against his face sticks its loose weave bound to his skin by clotted blood
he pulls very gently and winces as blood starts to flow again
he carefully tears the rag in half so that only a bit of it remains adhering to his jaw
it is pulled over to the side of an untraveled road
the door opens and carl emerges with the briefcase
he slogs through the snow down a gulley and up the embankment to a barbed wire fence
he kneels at one of the fence posts and frantically digs into the snow with his bare hands throws in the briefcase and covers it back up
he stands and tries to beat the circulation back into his red frozen hands
he looks to the right
a regular line of identical fence posts stretches away against unblemished white
he looks to the left
a regular line of identical fence posts stretches away against unblemished white
he looks at the fence post in front of him
he looks about the snowy vastness for a marker
finding none he kicks the fence post a couple of times failing to scar or tilt it then hurriedly plants a couple of sicks up against the post
he bends down scoops up a handful of snow presses it against his wounded jaw and lopes back to the idling car
marge has a packed overnight back sitting on the unmade bed
she is ready to leave already wearing her parka but is on the phone
no im leavin this mornin back up to brainerd

marge drives gazing out at the road
she leans out of her open window and yells at the order panel hello
she sits in the lot eating a breakfast sandwich
jerry is at his desk using a blunt pencil to enter numbers onto a form
beneath the form is a piece of carbon paper and beneath that another form copy which jerry periodically checks
the carbon copy form shows thick smudgy illegible entries
jerry hums nervously
glass rattles as someone taps at his door
jerry looks up and freezes mouth hanging open brow knit with worry
marge sticks her head in the door
sorry to bother you again

she starts to enter
yah no im kinda im kinda busy i unnerstand
ill keep it real short then
im on my way out of town but i was just do you mind if i sit down

he is yanking his parka from a hook behind the opened door and grabbing a pair of galoshes
if its so damned imporant to ya
im sorry sir i jerry has the parka slung over one arm and the galoshes pinched in his hand
aw what the christ
he stamps out the door
after a long moment her stare breaks
she glances idly around the office
there is a framed picture facing away from her on the desktop
she turns it to face her
it is scotty holding an accordion
there is another picture of jean
marge looks at it looks around for some reason at the ceiling
she looks at a trophy shelf on the wall behind her
she fiddles idly with a pencil
she pulls a clipboard toward her
it holds a form from the general motors finance corporation
she looks idly around
her look abruptly locks
oh for petes sake
jerry is easing his car around the near corner of the building
marges voice is flat with dismay oh for petes sake
she grabs the phone and punches in a number
for petes s hes fleein the interview
hes feelin the interview
jerry makes a left turn into traffic
detective sibert please
we are looking across a steam table at a man in blue
he moves slowly to the right pushing his tray along a cafeteria line
behind him in the depth of the room is an eating area of long formica tables at which sit a mix of uniformed and civilian clothed police and staff
we are listening to an offscreen womans voice
well so far were just saying hes wanted for questioning in connection with a triple homicide
nobody at the dealship theres been much help guessing where he might go
the woman is entering frame sliding a tray
marge enters behind her sliding her own
we move laterally with them as they slowly make their way along the line
we called his house his little boy said he hadnt been there
and his wife
shes visiting relatives in florida
now his boss this guy gustafson hes also disappeared
nobody at his office knows where he is
looks like this thing goes higher than we thought
you call his home
his wifes in the hospital has been for a couple months
the big c

he sits eating a swansons tv dinner from a tv tray he has set up in front of an easy chair
he watches the old black and white tv set whose image it might be a game show is still heavily ghosting and diffused by snow
the audio crackles with interference
despite the impenetrability of its image it holds grimsruds complete attention
at the sound of the front door opening grimsrud looks up
carl enters his face suppurating and raw
he reacts to grimsruds wordless look with a grotesque laugh
you should she zhe uzher guy
he glances around

jean sits slumped in a straight backed chair facing the wall
her hooded head resting on her chin is motionless
there is blood on the facing wall
she started shrieking you know

well i gotta muddy
he is plunking down eight bank wrapped bundles on the table

he makes one pile pockets the rest

he slaps keys down on the table

carl looks at him

grimsrud looks sourly up
there is a beat
finally one of us pays the other for half
carl waits for an argument but only gets the steady sour look
carl pulls out a gun
carl returns grimsruds stare

grimsrud says nothing
disgusted carl pockets the gun and heads for the door
fuckin ash hole
and if you shee your friend shep proudpfut tell him im gonna nail hizh fuckin ash
we are pulling carl as he walks toward the car
behind him we see the cabin door opening
carl turns reacting to the sound
grimsrud is bounding out wearing mittens and a red hunters cap but no overcoat
he is holding an ax
carl fumbles in his pocket for his gun
grimsrud swings overhand burying the ax in carls neck
in her cruiser on her two way
through it we hear lous voice heavily filtered his wife
this guy says she was kidnapped last wednesday
the day of our homicides
marge is peering to one side as she drives looking through the bare trees that border the road on a declivity that runs down to a large frozen lake
and this guy is
lundegaards father in laws accountant
but we still havent found gustafson
sorry didnt copy
and lundegaard too
where are ya margie
we hear distant but growing louder harsh engine noise as of a chainsaw or lawnmower
oh im almost back im driving around moose lake
yah the loudmouth
so the whole state has it lundegaard and gustafson
yah its over the wire its everywhere theyll find em
weve got a theres the car
theres the car
we are slowing as we approach a short driveway leading down to a cabin
parked in front is the brown cutlass ciera
dont go in
wait for back up
marge is straining to look
the power tool noise is louder here but still muffled its source not yet visible
yah send me back up
are we the closest pd
yah menominie only has chief perpich and he takes february off to go to boundary waters
marge pulls her prowler over some distance past the cabin
she gets out zips up her khaki parka and pulls up its fur lined hood
for a moment she stands listening to the muffled roar of the power tool
then with one curved arm half pressing against half supporting her belly she takes slow gingerly steps down the slope through the deep snow through the trees angling toward the
cabin and the source of the grinding noise
she slogs from tree to tree letting each one support her downhill leaning weight for a moment before slogging to the next
the roar grows louder
marge stands panting by one tree her breath vaporizing out of her snorkel hood
she squints down toward the cabins back lot
a tall man with his back to us wearing a red plaid quilted jacket and a hunting cap with earflaps is laboring over a large power tool which his body
blocks from view
the man is forcing downward something which engages the roaring power tool and makes harsh spluttering noises
the man is grimsrud his nose red and eyes watering from the cold hatflaps pulled down over his ears
his breath steams as he sourly goes about his work both hands pressing down a shod foot as it if were the shaft of a butter churn
the roar is very loud
marge slogs down to the next tree panting looking
grimsrud forces more of the leg into the machine which we can now see sprays small wet chunks out the bottom
marges eyes shift
a large dark form lies in the snow next to grimsrud
grimsrud works on eyes watering
with a grunt he bends down out of frame and then re enters holding a thick log
he uses it to force the leg deeper into the machine
marge is advancing
she holds a gun extended toward grimsrud who is still turned away
grimsrud rubs his nose with the back of his hand
marge closes in grimacing
grimsruds back strains as he puts his weight into the log that pushes down into the machine
the dark shape in the snow next to his side is the rest of carl showalters body
marge has drawn to within twenty yards
when she bellows it sounds hollow and distant her voice all but eaten up by the roar of the power tool
turn around and hands up
startled grimsrud scowls
he turns to face her
marge bellows again hands up
conscious of the noise she shows with a twist of her shoulder the armpatch insignia
with a quick twist he reaches back for the log hurls it at marge and then starts running away
marge twists her body sideways shielding herself
no need the heavy log travels perhaps ten yards and lands in the snow several feet short of her
grimsrud pants up the hill slow going through the deep snow
behind him halt
she fires in the air
she lowers the gun and carefully sighs
grimsrud still slogs up the hill a miss
marge sights again
she fires again
grimsrud pitches forward
he mutters in swedish as he reaches down to clutch at his wounded leg
marge walks toward him gun trained on him as her other hand reaches under her parka and gropes around her waist
it comes out with a pair of handcuffs which she opens with a snap of the wrist
all right buddy
on your belly and your hands clasped behind you
grimsrud sits in the back seat hands cuffed behind him
for a long moment there he is quiet only engine hum and the periodic clomp of wheels on pavement seams as marge grimly shakes her head
so that was mrs
lundegaard in there
she glances up in the rear view mirror
grimsrud cheeks sunk eyes hollow looks sourly out at the road
marge shakes her head
at length i guess that was your accomplice in the wood chipper
grimsruds head bobs with bumps on the road otherwise he is motionless reactionless scowling and gazing out
and those three people in brainerd
marge gazing forward seems to be talking to herself
and for what
for a little bit of money
we hear distant sirens
theres more to life than money you know
she glances up in the rear view mirror
dont you know that
and here ya are and its a beautiful day
grimsruds hollow eyes stare out
the sirens are getting louder
marge pulls over
she leans forward to the dash to give two short signalling whoops on her siren
she turns on her flashers
she leans back with a creak and jangle of utilities
she stares forward shakes her head
we hear the dull click of her flashers
i just dont unnerstand it
outside it is snowing
the sky the earth the road all white
a squad car gumballs spinning punches through the white
it approaches in slow motion
an ambulance punches through after it
another squad car
it stands next to a highway on a snowy windslept plain
one or two cars dot the parking lot along with an idling police cruiser
we are looking over the shoulders of two uniformed policemen who stand on either side of the door their hands resting lightly on their holstered sidearms
one of them raps at the door
a title fades in outside of bismark north dakota after a pause muffled through the door who
anderson is this your burgundy out here
just a sec
could you open the door please
yah just a sec
we hear a clatter from inside
just a sec
one of the policemen unholsters his gun and nods to someone whose back enters a superintendent holding a ring of keys
this man turns a key in the door and then stands away
the two policemen guns at the ready bang into the motel room
the rough hand held camera rushes in behind them as the two men give the room a two handed sweep with their guns
the room is empty
cop one indicates the open bathroom door
the two men charge the bathroom belts jingling guns at the ready jittery camera behind them rushing to keep pace
a man in boxer shorts is halfway out the bathroom window
the policemen holster their guns and charge the window and drag jerry lundegaard back into the room
his flesh quivers as he thrashes and keens in short piercing screams
the cops wrestle him to the floor but his palsied thrashing continues
the policemen struggle to restrain him
call an ambulance
you got him okay
cop one pinions jerrys arms to the floor and jerry bursts into uncontrolled sobbing
yah yah call an ambulance
jerry sobs and screams
we are square on norm who sits in bed watching television
after a long beat marge enters frame in a nightie and climbs into bed with some effort
norm reaches for her hand as both watch the television
at length norm speaks but keeps his eyes on the tv
they announced it
marge looks at him
they announced it
marge looks at him waiting for more but norms eyes stay fixed on the television
three cent stamp
norm thats terrific
norm tries to suppress a smile of pleasure
its just the three cent
hautmans blue winged teal got the twenty nine cent
people dont much use the three cent
oh for petes a course they do
every time they raise the darned postage people need the little stamps
when theyre stuck with a bunch a the old ones
yah i guess
her eyes go back to the tv
im so proud a you norm
norm murmurs i love you margie
i love you norm
both of them are watching the tv as norm reaches out to rest a hand on top of her stomach
two more months
marge absently rests her own hand on top of his
two more months
hold fade out
