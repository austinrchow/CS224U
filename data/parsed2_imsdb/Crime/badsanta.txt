by glenn ficarra john requa revisions by ethan coen joel coen polish by terry zwigoff dimension films production draft white february snow flakes falling against a black sky
it looks like a warm cozy place out of its a wonderful life
the window is flocked with fake snow and hung with colorful christmas lights wreaths and ornaments
the barman wiping down the counter gives an occasional semi furtive glance toward the far end of the bar
other patrons chat near the bartender and also give occasional glances toward the far end of the bar
it is early evening happy hour and the clientele is well heeled and sociable
a customer says something interrogative to the bartender who looks down the bar and shrugs
reverse camera continues movement notes the combination of the high angle and the tilt of santas head keep his face from being clearly revealed in this scene
sitting alone at the far end of the bar given a wide berth by the other customers a man willie stares morosely into his drink
the drink is clearly not his first
he wears a red velvet suit and red velvet hat with a white pom pom
he has shiny black boots with red velvet trim
his long white beard is not real and is in fact pulled down below his chin to facilitate drinking
it exposes heavy black stubble
swaying slightly he raises the drink to the vicinity of his lips
once it gets close he must navigate it in with some effortful coordination
he takes a sip and sets the drink carefully back down
after another long staring morose beat he starts weeping
it is loud dolorous and unself conscious
santa staggers out the back door
camera follows behind him still hiding his face
santa gets about ten feet then pauses and leans with one hand against the alley wall uses the other to hold his pom pom out of the way and vomits
having vomited and spit he staggers off toward the street
an upbeat woman trainer presides over a half dozen santas sitting at school desks
on the blackboard the trainer is writing out the sixth santa commandment
no alcoholic beverages before or during your shift
know the names of your reindeer
do not smoke in your costume
absolutely no flirting
coax a smile from the child
as she writes coax
turning to face them remember parents dont want photos where their child isnt smiling
some children may not want to smile
it is your job to coax a smile out of them
a good line to remember is santa thinks everybody should be happy
can you smile for santa
a camera can only copy a childs smile it will take you to put it there
as she talks we one of the santas willie
his hand reaches into a boot and pulls out a pint of smirnoff
we follow up in c
to see this hand pour a few ounces into a can of coke he holds behind his desk
if the child will not smile the photo elf will go ahead and take the picture anyway
now it is a good santas job to smile as well i know with the big white beard your smile will be partially hidden so you must learn to smile
with your eyes
they show warmth and can be very expressive
as he finishes off the can of coke to reveal his eyes colder than those of a dead fish
remember you have been chosen for the starring role of santa claus
your portrayal of this beloved character will have a major impact on every child you meet
keep in mind at all times that to them you arent a man dressed up like santa you are santa
his expression reads please kill me
ray coniffs jolly ole saint nicholas scores views of the downtown blanketed in snow and decorated for the holiday
it is christmas eve and the sidewalks throng with people rushing to do their last minute shopping
a mother and her two absurdly bundled children emerge from the crowd
hurry boys were gonna miss santa
she drags them across the street toward the looming art deco monolith that is the big city department store
mother and children crest the escalator to emerge on the top floor
the older child is pointing at a prop gate with a candy cane letter sign to santas workshop
he runs and mom shoos her younger child to join him
the boys cross the threshold of the gate and their eyes filled with wonder
a winding path cuts through a flocked and candy striped forest past a workshop filled with mannequin elves busily cobbling christmas toys and finally arriving at
santa seated on his throne like a scarlet messiah
the younger child staggers forward to join the line of a hundred other leaky nosed worshippers awaiting an audience
at the head of the line the next waiting child is escorted to santas chair by a smiling tiny man marcus dressed as an elf
an imitation back street boys quintet sings christmas carols
grown ups busy themselves draining their wallets as a voice comes over the intercom attention shoppers the store will be closing in five minutes
we hope tomorrow is a pleasant christmas and thank you for shopping with us your friends
purposeful haste eddies the crowd
the photo elf takes the digital photo and presents it to a dutifully reciting his spiel my what a darling picture
are you certain you only want the single
additional photos come in handy as gifts for grandma and grandpa or a wonderful remembrance for friends
thats all right ill just take the single
he takes her credit card as camera moves over to santa
on his knee is a young boy who whispers excitedly in his ear
disinterested uh huh
young boy climbs off and runs away a bratty kid jumps up on santas lap
i saw you in another mall
not even looking at him right
good for you
youre not really santa
if you were santa you could do magic
looks at him you want magic
santa pushes him off his lap and shoves him on his way
there i just made you disappear
santa turns to his elf that it
the elf nods as he peels off a pointed prosthetic ear
santa pulls a fifth of old grandad from the cushions of his throne
thank fuckin christ
he takes a swig
with the sound of closing circuits banks of lights systematically shut down in the various departments of the now empty store
downstairs the last of the store employees file out the door past an old security guard
eventually santa emerges
merry christmas willie
up your ass
the guard chuckles
have it your way willie
dont tell me which way to have it
the security guard heads for a panel near the doorway and punches a key labeled arm
readout labeled arming counts down from seconds
the guard exits the store locks the door and heads home
a large teddy bear sits under a christmas tree
suddenly it moves bolting upright and sprinting from the room
the alarm continues to count down
the teddy bear slides down the space between the railing of the escalators
landing on its feet it barrels toward the door
the teddy bear scrambles for the door crashing into everything in its path
running past a clothing display it rips the arm off a mannequin without breaking stride
it skids to a stop at the base of the alarm box too short to reach the controls
it raises the mannequin arm using the pointed finger on its hand to press the cancel key on the keypad
mission accomplished the teddy bear rips off its head to reveal his true identity santas elf in civilian life known as marcus skidmore
he is covered in sweat and panting like an asthmatic
a hasp flips open and marcus swings the door wide to reveal a beer guzzling santa in the off season known as willie t
he finishes the beer crushes the can and drops it to his feet next to eight more empties
marcus sneers at him as he lumbers past jesus
marcus and willie tear open the prop presents on the workshop set and remove several tools
marcus reaches into jewelry cases and removes a few particular items
he drops them into a stock cart then checks a typed list before moving on
marcus pushes the cart through the store gathering an odd array of items that range from furs to gowns to shoes to makeup
marcus arrives outside a doorway and looks in to see willie manning a large water drill and putting it to work on the stores vault
hows it goin
im finished when im finished
im goin downstairs
referring to list i need a melon bailer and a loofah
the drill suddenly revs higher getting willies attention
marcus moves closer as willie pulls back the drill on the track
he places a screwdriver into the exposed lock assembly and hits it with a sledgehammer
suddenly the door swings open and bundled cash spills to the floor
both men are impressed
fuck the loofah lets go
marcus and willie wheel out two carts and roll them through the open doors of a waiting van
as they slam the doors willie settles on the rear bench as marcus gets into the passenger seat next to his pillipina mail order wife of several years lois who
is dressed in expensively ugly clothes and whose mouth is ever down turned in pruney distaste
marcus did you get the loofah
the van speeds away through the christmas eve night and disappears into the distance like the down of a thistle
camera rockets into c
of an alarm clock ringing with a jolt
willie in bed blearily wakes to the insistent alarm
he tries to turn it off but his fingers are still clotted with sleep
in a series of frustrated grunts and groans he becomes more and more aggravated until finally he bolts out of bed and throws the clock into the wall
he stoops for some beer bottle empties and hurls them at the clock debris
one final scream and its out of his system
he finds one last bottle in his hand half full with a cigarette butt floating in it
he downs the beer and steps into the adjoining bathroom to brush his teeth
willie sipping a cup of coffee meanders down the street scratching his ass
willies walk brings him to a fancy eatery at lunchtime
as he passes he casually snatches a handful of car keys from the parking valet key box and moves on
as he rounds the corner into the lot he pushes on the various key fobs identifying various cars when their alarms chirp
he seems dissatisfied until a brand new cadillac chirps
willie gets in and drives off
he reaches over into the glove compartment and pulls out the registration
he focuses on the car owners address
willie eating a corn dog saunters down an opulent hallway a beer swinging in one hand
in long shot through the open door of an extravagant marble bathroom we see willie sitting on the toilet leafing through a magazine beer bottle on the counter next to
pants around his ankles
willie standing by the toilet finishes buckling his belt and flips the flush lever
nothing happens no whoosh of rushing water
willie looking down into the toilet gives the lever a couple more clanking tries and then grabs his beer and ambles off
sucking on his beer willie paces the periphery of the room methodically knocking painting after painting off the walls
willie arrives in the bedroom still knocking down paintings until finally he exposes a wall safe
a smile and he pulls out a stethoscope
the safe door swings open to reveal stacks of cash
willie scratches a lottery ticket
hes now wearing a rolex and some gaudy ring
he reaches for another one and we see that on the bartop in front of him are neat stacks of lottery tickets as yet unscratched and an untidy jumble of
on the other side of the bar a middle aged stripper vies for his attention
willies ticket hits for
he tucks it into the strippers g string swigs a drink and resumes scratching
willie and the stripper stagger into his apartment drunk
as he passes his blinking answering machine i got messages
go wash yourself
im a dancer i sweat
well you smell like a bums nutsack
as she exits he activates the machine
soke this is andrew kaplan again from the collection agency boop
willie skips to the next message
willie i dont care man im not looking to blame anyone but that diamond isnt a real stone man
i took it to boop
willie skips to the next message
uh hello this is helen axelrod you ran into my car last week
well i called state farm but they have no record of any insurance policy for you and boop
willie skips to the next message
willie its marcus
its that time of year again
pack your shit
to the chimey chords of sleigh ride we see phoenix arizona in montage dressed for christmas but sweltering under its oppressive winter heat
through the heat ripples rising off the pavement two mirage like figures cross the infinite asphalt of the saguaro square mall parking lot willie and marcus in santa and elf
regalia sweating and panting in the heat
willie polishes off a pint of smirnoffs and flips it towards a nearby trash can
it misses and breaks loudly on the pavement
can you maybe keep it together for just ten minutes
he pulls some tic tacs out of his pocket
for crying out loud chew a few of these
you drunken fuckin imbecile
anchoring the huge mall complex is the large and upscale chamberlains department store
amid the bustle of holiday shopping an angry heavy set man with a grizzly adams beard stomps away from the pursuing store manager bob chipeska
harrison please i just let me explain
financially the you get what you pay for chipeska
five christmases ive given my heart my soul my love to these kids and now what

i do burl ives songs does this schmoe even play guitar
harrison its not the money or the midget
believe me if it was i i dont think they like midget
i think youre supposed to call them aw forget it
harrison stomps away and right toward marcus and willie as they enter the store
willie and marcus stop in their tracks and watch the burly man storm out
bob chipeska watches with them
i please i uh please dont listen to him
great resume and photo by the way
you know we been at this a long time an all so we like to think we do a good job
a beautiful girl wearing skin tight pants walks by catching willies eye
he stares wantonly at her ass off in his own little world
you two are the best men for the job
so do not let his
unpleasantness affect your performance in any way
oh no were fine w irked snapping out of his daydream performance
willies reaction worries marcus
you know the
willie no he you saying theres something wrong with my gear
were gonna head upstairs now
marcus shoves willie who stalks off
marcus lingers to smooth things over
he forces a grin and shakes his head
such a card
hes not gonna say fuck stick in front of the children is he
no no no
a long long long silence
marcus pantomimes helpless laughter noiselessly throwing his head back and holding his gut as it heaves with mirth
he is instantly composed
on an upper floor of chamberlains the theme is the desert as winter wonderland
cacti and tumbleweeds are wrapped with lights and flocked with snow and a team of nine stuffed burros are hitched to a sleigh
rudolfo the red nosed burro is tended by several santas elf mannequins
one in cowboy wear and another in a poncho and sombrero
again there is a line of waiting children
marcus makes his way through the line as kids gasp and cheer
he plays to the crowd
marcus gets to the head of the line ducks under the velvet rope and goes behind the flimsy cardboard set
willie sits there morosely head slumped forearms on knees red velvet hanging limply from one hand
what the fuck you doing fuck stick in front of the boss
i dont like that guy
he takes a bottle from the floor by his feet and swigs off it
marcus stares at him
you dont like any guy
you think i cant find another portly motherfuck can run a water drill
willie just slumps there apologetically
dont tempt my hand
you blow this and were broke for the year
so stop acting like you know something because pal of mine you dont know squat
youre gum on my shoe
now put on your fuckin hat and get out there
he grabs the hat slams it into willies chest and as willie rises kicks him in the ass
willie just takes it shambling off
and try to act professional
on the outskirts of the saguaro square malls parking lot a city bus stops with a hiss
the doors swing open to reveal a pathetic eight year old kid overweight snot nosed badly dressed and probably smelling of pee
as the kid nears the mall entrance he passes a group of older children doing skateboard stunts
they notice him
one of them throws an empty can that hits him in the head
the kid walks on it seems without noticing
the bullies disheartened by the lack of reaction go back to their skateboarding
marcus leads a large heavyset boy over to the throne
the boy eats a chocolate ice cream cone which is smeared all over his mouth and t shirt
marcus lifts him with effort and a groan onto willies lap
all right wuddya want
nintendo deer hunter
the heavyset boy hops off onto willies foot by mistake
watch the toenails willya
marcus puts a young girl on his lap
she looks up at him in awe
yeah cmon cmon wuddya want
marcus puts another young boy on his lap
what do you want
fraggle stick car
to himself fuck is that
back to the kid fine whatever next

marcus walks over to the rope
the snot nosed kid is next in line frozen by fear
marcus pulls on his hand
the kid stays put
whats your name
the kid shakes his head meekly
you can tell me
how about santa
if you dont tell him you wont get a present
this penetrates the kids fear
lets tell santa
marcus leads the kid up to the throne and places him on willies lap
what do you want
cmon wuddya want
a snot rag
the kid just stares motionless except for the flowing rivulet of snot
willie cant help but stare at it
to himself another fuckin mongoloid
shouts marcus i get him outta here before he pisses on me
suddenly the kid is moved to yank willies beard
he holds it stretched below willies chin
whispered to the kid let it go you little bastard
its not real
it was real
the hair fell out when i got sick
howd you get sick
i loved a woman who wasnt clean
no her sister
whispers through clenched teeth let the fucking thing go
whats it like at the north pole

what the fuck do you care
willie shoves the kid get the hell off my lap
the kid backs away looking at him
you are really santa right
no im an accountant
i wear this as a fucking fashion thing
the kid backs away in awe never breaking his reverent stare
as marcus helps the next child onto santas lap willie hisses at him get that kid out of here hes freaking me out
the kid sits on a bench watching the entrance to chamberlains
after a beat willie and marcus walk out in costume and cross toward the parking lot
the kid follows from a safe distance
willie and marcus walk across the huge empty parking lot followed at a great distance by the kid
they arrive at their cars marcus van and a beat up old chrysler that is willies parked next to each other
as the kid creeps closer he is able to hear their conversation
willie motions to the black angus in the parking lot
i gotta get a drink on

lollipop guild asshole
jesus two year olds flip me shit bettern you

pauses then deliberately yeah
im gonna stick my whole fist up your ass
a large faux rustic bar filled to capacity with loosened tie middle management
crammed at the far end of the bar willie stands out like a sore thumb in this thirty ish crowd
we follow his gaze all around the perimeter of the room until it connects with the drunken glowering face of a hindustani troublemaker sitting right across from him startling willie
for a moment
willie regains his composure then gives the guy a puzzled look back and amused by the guys unflinching anger raises his glass in a toast to him as if to
cheers you nutcase and turns back to his drink
the man stands up and never releasing his stare moves right up to willie two inches from his face
willie looks up
hindi accent listen here buddy let me make yourself perfectly clear
we dont like your kind coming around here in your red silk and satin clothes with your hunger for same sex relationships
consider yourself warned
well fu uck you
i know thats what youd like to do
willie gears up for a swing
up yours yufff a hand grabs his arm
willie follows the hand to find a mature but attractive barmaid sue an outdoorsy western beauty
her eyes and willies lock a source of sardonic amusement for the troublemaker
oh saved by a woman mister no pussy please man
he stalks off
he aint worth it sugar
he got hit on last week
didnt sit too well
by the bathroom the troublemaker is in another mans face this is not flagstaff
another grandad santa
she pours him another and slams it on the bar
got a name
he pounds the drink
nothing else is forthcoming
what do you do
i mean after the holidays
nothing til march

she pours two
they both pound them back
her statement is a question not a big talker
buy you one
as she pours youre pretty regular for a santa
he shrugs its my job no big deal
im an eating drinking shitting fucking santa claus
willie stares at her
willie is on top of the barmaid humping her still in his santa suit
his pom pom bobs in rhythm with his thrusts
fuck me santa
fuck me santa
the hat is slipping askew
he reaches for it
at least lemme take off the hat
in the parking lot the barmaid finishes straightening her clothes and touching up her lipstick in the rearview mirror
willie leaning against his car still in his santa suit fires up a post coital cigarette
i got a thing for santa claus i dont know i guess its from early childhood
taking a swig yeah sos my thing for tits
maybe because my parents were jewish and never celebrated christmas
santa was sort of forbidden you know
she gets out of the car
i like you
most of the people around here are pretty uptight
my name is sue
heres my number
she hands him the slip of paper and ambles off calling back over her shoulder dont mothball that suit
willie nodding understanding turns to reach for his car door and the accompanying pan over brings in the screaming homophobe
all right buddy thats it
i said i am not gay
look whats the problem pal you go off your meds
the man stares at him for a beat
yes but this isnt about that
you are queer as a ten dollar bill
now you listen
my brother lost an arm fighting you people in vietnam so i want you to take a good hard look at this face
willie pulls back a fist
cause its the last fuckin thing youre gonna see before i knock your head off and sh whack whack whack whack whack
the man surprises willie with a flurry of effective punches
in moments willie is on the losing end of homosexual panic
who is the bitch now fat man
leave santa alone
the troublemaker stops and looks down to find the kid beating on his legs
please little boy i am doing this for all of us
willie gets a chance to regain composure
he wipes the blood from his mouth raises his fists and
i think he has finished his cruising for tonight hm
the hindustani hothead wanders off
the kid shuffles over to the prone willie
the kid sits in the front seat next to willie who drives stewing
this one time i take you home
im not your fuckin dada
its not as if you helped out with that nut job
and youre right there to grab his fuckin balls
willie demonstrates with a sharp turn of his hand twist em
why do you need a car

willie answers absently his head slightly ducked and his eyes darting side to side checking for road signs repairs
in the shop

next to the shop

willie admires the surroundings
hes on a adventure sploring mountains
he been gone a long time
whens he coming back
what about mommy
she lives in gods house with jesus and mary and the ghost and the long eared donkey and joseph and the talking walnut
who the fuck takes care of you then
hatching an idea really
whats her name
as the kid lets himself in willie pulls out a black ski mask and puts it on his head like a stocking cap
is granny spry
he unrolls the mask to cover his face and takes out a blackjack
willie enters the foyer as the kid walks into the adjoining room
he approaches a figure in a la z boy watching tv
granma santas here
are you spry
grandma rises from her chair with the assistance of her walker and begins to move toward willie
she wears a bathrobe and thick glasses and has another pair of glasses on a chain around her neck
let me fix you some sandwiches
he watches as the senile old woman innocently putters away
he yanks off his mask and turns to the kid
so youre tellin me no one else is here
the kid shakes his head
no aunts no uncles no cousins
the kid shakes his head
butler security guard
this sinks in
willie looks to the kid
daddy got a safe
the sound of a tumbler tripping and suddenly light sweeps in as the safe door opens to reveal a smiling willie with his stethoscope in his ears
in the foreground a few stacks of cash and a folio
willie reaches in
willie grabs the folio and flips through it
insurance forms deeds social security cards birth certificates etc
all bear the name of the kids father roger merman
nothing of value
he puts the folio back grabs the cash
you need money to fix your sleigh
you want milk and cookies
willie bends down and faces the kid with a smile
daddy got a car
at the cut a new mercedes screeches through the frame and as we hear it recede we are left looking at the kid who stands at the curb waving happily
close up the glowing ash of a cigarette burning down
the inhale lasts as long as comic timing will allow about six or seven seconds
a wiry hard bitten sun baked saddlebag of a man gin slagel sits behind his cluttered desk sucking on a filterless pall mall
we can hear his in taken breath rattling over and around the phlegm growths and polyps that line his embattled trachea
his words come out on an exhaled cloud chambers worth of smoke fuck stick
bob chipeska sits opposite
yes i thought it was strange too but you know i i i i uh i his little friend promised he wouldnt say it in front of the children
which is fine because you know urn theres an adult world and a childs world and thats okay
im not a censor
yes a a a dwarf
a a i dont know what hes called exactly but
a little guy
but thin fingers
not the fat sausage fingers
little people thats what they like
ah yes right
so fuck stick thats all
well no there was something else
chipeska walks by a cashier station carrying some paperwork hes absorbed in but hears some faint groans that make him pause
curious he heads in the direction of the sounds
theyre coming from the dressing room area
chipeska curiously makes his way towards a corridor of dressing rooms
a couple of days ago i was in womens big tall
a sign reads three times a lady
he goes down a corridor of dressing rooms
and i heard these urn you know these
the sound of throttling lust builds in volume
he follows his ears until he arrives at a dressing room door
a big or tall woman within screams with pleasure oh yeah
you aint gonna shit right for a week
he looks underneath and spots black santa boots with red velvet pants around the ankles
bob chipeska holds up one hand
now dont get me wrong
i was against the clinton impeachment
what a man does with his penis oval office womens big tall its not for the american people to say
but when youre dealing with children a tender sensibility a position of trust then perhaps someone who has screaming orgasms with large women mm

i am no siziat

theyd all say if it had been a supermodel or uh
a lot of special pleading
bitch bitch bitch
but i cant help it the guy makes me uneasy
santa fuckin someone in the ass
so maybe theres something i could fire him for
do you think you could find something
oh shit yeah
theres always something
pov through the arcades window shows willie talking in pantomime to a young girl a very young girl at one of the pinball machines
willie has his hands out to either side and is either demonstrating the kind of body english to apply to the machine or else is describing an elaborate sexual encounter
either recalled or prospective
the girl giggles
a reverse shows marcus halted at the arcade window staring in with disbelief that gives way to jaw grinding anger motherfucker
oh you lousy fucking motherfuck
willie and marcus walk to their cars
thats just the kinda shit thats gonna get us pinched
apologetic she said she was eighteen

well i can take care of myself and i dont need no lectures
i know how to keep a low profile
willie uses his key fob to deactivate the car alarm to the mercedes
what the fuck is this
mind your own fucking business
willie opens the door and an avalanche of beer bottle empties tumbles out rolling everywhere
willie starts the engine and pulls out and marcus yells to the receding car then to himself you dumb dipshit motherfucker
willie parks the mercedes in the front of a rundown motel complex
he walks past hookers and junkies until he gets to his unit
he pulls out his key and just as hes about to insert it in the lock he sees a flashlight beam shining inside the window
surprised he backs off cautiously and presses up against the wall
someone inside is rifling the room
willie hisses at a nearby hooker opal come here
opal looks at him with disdain
screw you willie last time i didnt shit right for a week
no not that come here
reluctantly she sidles over
who the fucks in my room did you see someone go into my fuckin room
yeah some guy askin boutcha looked like a cop
marcus is on the phone with willie
you get a look at him
willie is at a pay phone
no i think its a cop though

the kid swings the door open to willie who stands on the stoop holding a small grip
youre bringing my present early
but i never told you what i wanted
i said i didnt bring it dipshit
i want a stuffed elephant
a pink one
he brushes past the kid into the house eyes darting this way and that
wish in one hand and shit in the other see which fills up faster
the kid follows willie like a puppy dog as willie checks out the house bumping open doors looking around
im gonna be staying here a while
things are all fucked up at the north pole
she walked in on me fuckin her sister
so im out on my fuckin ass
shes taking half of everything
willie has discovered the master bedroom by appearances long unused
he tosses his grip onto the double bed

what about the reindeer
pleading dont start with the fucking reindeer
the kid sits on a stool hands on his knees staring motionless
finally whatre their names
willie lies in the tub also motionless a wet washcloth over his face fingers of one hand resting against a tumbler filled with ice and amber liquid that sits on
the edge of the tub
from under his washcloth who
to himself oh fuck
then to the kid i i cant remember
sneezy and dopey thats the seven dwarves
shit is that not
i just fuck i dont know ill just say hey bub look i
he drags the washcloth off his face and looks at the kid
the kid looks at him unperturbed
how old are they
willie staggers in a towel around his waist the empty rock glass in one hand a bottle tucked under the other arm the kid trotting after
you want cookies
willie carefully carefully puts glass and bottle down on the nightstand and slowly raises both hands in a dont
move gesture to keep them from flying off
should i fix you some sandwiches
what is with the fixing sandwiches
satisfied that the bottle and glass are not going anywhere willie climbs unsteadily onto the bed and stares at the ceiling
you want anything else
as soon as the bed stops moving im going to sleep
wake me up
when the little hand is on the
a long beat
the ragged breath of drunken sleep
marcuss wife lois stands in front of a mirror trying on a cashmere scarf
her look of pruney disapproval is in place as ever
she takes off the scarf and writes something in a small spiral notebook
can i help you maam
across the store she spies the jewelry counter
lois stands looking intently down through the glass case in pruney disapproval
help you with anything maam
without bothering to look up just looking
as he drifts away she takes out her spiral notebook and makes more notes
willie and marcus nosh on food court gyros

lois appears with a salad on a tray and a look of pruney disapproval
she sits next to marcus and in the way of old couples comfortable with each other he rests a hand on her knee and continues to talk ignoring her while
she picks through her salad ignoring him
you are by far the dumbest most pathetic piece of maggot eaten shit that has ever slid from gods gilded ass
what if the kid has one of those fucking play dates they have now
you shittin me
he doesnt have fucking friends
not even an imaginary one
unless he got ditched by him
hes just a fuckin misfit
lives with his grandma who sits drooling in front of the tv
every once in a while she gets up to play soccer with her tits

she dont know her ass from last tuesday
marcus thinks a moment

why is everything sex with you
i fuck one person i aint out there serial fornicating trying to float my liver

lois chewing on her salad notices someone walking by with a chamberlains bag
she glances in as the person passes and still chewing gets out her notebook and jots something down
whatre you fuckin sigmund sawed off freud
the shrunken fuckin shrink
yeah thats right shit for brains talk about my height
make it about something safe
cause youre an emotional fucking cripple
your soul is dog shit
every single fuckin thing about you is ugly
marcus and lois get up to leave
ive seen anal warts more attractive than you
they walk off
willie sits there for a moment
goes back to eating his hamburger
a woman comes up with her toddler in tow
oh look whos here jimmy
lets tell him what you want for christmas
shouting food flying out of his mouth putting her hands over the toddlers ears are you insane
how dare you talk like that in front of a child
the management is going to hear about this
im going to have you fired
thats a threat
you think you can make my life any worse you go ahead be my fucking guest
he throws his hamburger back down on his tray and storms off leaving the woman shocked
willie and the kid sit opposite each other over a game of checkers
willie scowls as the kid thinks for an eternity about his next move
the silence is deafening
willie stares at the board for a long beat
he leaps up screaming and flings the board across the room
willie throws checkers one by one against the wall punctuating each throw with an insult
son of a bitch
angle on kids face unfazed still smiling
the kid lies in bed sleeping peacefully
distant sounds of the slosh of water
the sloshing of water is now accompanied by a rhythmic slapping sound
willie bangs sue in the jacuzzi
he is wearing his santa hat
two tall water glasses are set down on a sideboard
a splash of orange juice is dolloped into each of the glasses and then both are filled to the top with vodka
wider on the living room reveals sue looking around
her speech and willies is somewhat impaired nice place you got
needs a bit of a womans touch but its really nice
sue accepts her refilled glass and sits on the sofa
so how long will you urn
she reaches down to fish under her ass in the sofa cushion and pulls out a red checker
she dully inspects it
how long you gonna be here
through the holidays
sue flips the checker away
so whats the thing you like kids
whaddya think im some kind of pervert
im talking about you being santa
he sways looking at her
no see the thing is
im not really santa
blearily she gazes back
after a moment oh
pause well still i gotta thing for you anyway cmere
he leans down to kiss her
the door opens to reveal sue on her way out
willie sways in the foyer a three quarters empty bottle of old grandad in hand
so ill see you soon i guess right
yeah im gonna send you some flowers
real good expensive ones
he closes the door
he then tips back the bottle and polishes it off with a series of quick gulps
ever so daintily he puts the bottle down
a beat later wham
he faints dead away hitting the floor like a felled tree
faintly distantly a blood curdling scream
willie wakes on the floor to the sound of the scream
he looks blearily up and immediately grabs his head feeling his hangover
following his ears he heads toward the hall
he passes grandma
let me fix you some sandwiches
a bedroom door crashes open and the kid emerges screaming and runs right into willie
he immediately caroms off and goes screaming down the hall
he looks down at his t shirt
there is a bloody palm print on his stomach
he turns the corner to the hall there is a row of fresh bloody palm prints down one side of the hall
the kid screaming is just disappearing at the far end
the kid is screaming jumping up and down and clutching one hand the bloody one with the other
what the fuck did you do
he goes up and tries to yank the hand which the hysterical kid yanks away
lemme look at it
what the fuck happened
as willie drags him to the sink and runs water over the cut the kid takes great gulping breaths and finally manages to say i cut myself by mistake
willie grabs a vodka bottle standing open on the counter and liberally pours some on the hand
the kid shrieks
i forgot to tell ya thatll sting
the kid yanks his hand away and runs off screaming
willie is left alone in the middle of the kitchen
he calls after the boy sincerely trying to help don t you want me to wrap it in a t shirt or something
it is early morning and the parking lot is empty except for marcus van
the mercedes eventually pulls in parking beside him
windows roll down
in the drivers seat marcus looks up from his watch with a scowl
marcus throws open the back of the van revealing the components of the water drill in various prop gift boxes
willie wears a forbearing smile kids lemmme tell ya
he shakes his head and chuckles as marcus tosses him an empty red santa sack
theyll run ya ragged
jesse the security guard unlocks the door and opens up for willie and marcus
they enter in costume
willie lugs the filled sack and seems to be straining
to willie ho
willie pants under the weight of his bag up your ass
as willie and marcus enter the store gin slagel drives by their cars carefully noting their tags
willie drops the bag with a loud thud
you tear your ball again
no its okay
together they unload the extremely heavy gifts
lets do the other thing
willie follows marcus behind the wonderland backdrop
marcus points to an air duct in the ceiling
willie crouches and marcus climbs on his shoulders
the duct pops open and marcus climbs in shimmying down to a junction and continuing on
a long row of cubicles each one occupied with customer service operators
as they work the loud squeaks and popping metal sounds of a dwarf crawling through a duct are heard above them
each operator in succession notes the racket looking up curiously as the sounds pass overhead
suddenly the sounds stop
everyone returns to work
the sounds resume
the operators look up again as the noises fade away
the sounds continue until marcus face appears at the ceiling duct of an unmanned surveillance room
he focuses on the wall of a hundred identical vcrs and squints to see the brand name sony hvr
lois exits an electronics store with a box slung under her arm her mouth turned down in pruney disapproval
she places the box on the hood of her car and we see its printings sony she opens the box fishes out the remote then tosses the box and vcr
into a nearby trash can
gin slagel walks through the main gate of the heavily fortified penitentiary leaving a huge trail of cigarette smoke
gin slagel sits smoking and waiting with family members and lawyers
a guard enters and motions
alright gin come on
gin sits down in one of the booths across from a middle aged prisoner
who are you
your name roger merman
yes but doing three to six for embezzlement
many accounting questions are not cut and dried you live at sage terrace
suddenly tense is it granma
is my son alright
do you have any house guests
the man is bewildered house guests
thanks much for your time
he gets up and walks away
who are you
who are you
gin sits at his desk sucking in a pall mall filterless
bob chipeska sits opposite
finally gin exhales like a crematorium
well its fucked
as a fuckin whistle
i mean shit he curses yeah
but never around children
no criminal record no parking tickets fchrists sake no bad habits even
but man is a sexual being
cant do shit about that jack
wouldnt want to
of course not
im not advocating celibacy
end of the human fuckin race
gin turns one palm up
fucks large women
what can i say
a bus clears frame revealing the kid as he walks toward the mall
the kid is hit in the head with a can again
again no reaction
someone in the group of frustrated bullies has a fresh idea wedgie
cheering the six bullies engulf the kid
marcus and willie go about the business of being a santa elf team
willie sees off another child pokemon
marcus heads to the velvet rope to find the kid mussed up and dirty the band of his underwear around his chest
marcus unclips the rope and the kid approaches willie
is that your underwear
part of it
wheres the rest
what do you want
i was thinking i wanted a purple stuffed elephant not pink but now i changed my mind
now i dont want an elephant at all
i want a gorilla named davy for beating up the skateboard kids who pull on my underwear and he could take his orders from the talking walnut so it wouldnt
be my bad thing
willie stares at him
you know when i was your age i didnt need no fuckin gorilla and i wasnt any bigger than you
one day i came crying home to dad because four kids had beat me up and you know what he did
he make it all better
he kicked my ass
you know why
you went bathroom on mommys dishes
what the fuck
he try to teach you not to cry and be a man
nope it was because he was a mean drunk son of a bitch
when he wasnt busy busting my ass he was puttin out cigarettes on my neck
the worlds fuckin unfair it dont give ya nothing
you can wish all you want but you gotta take what you need
stand up for yourself
stop being such a pussy and kick those kids in the balls or something
pause or dont i dont give a shit
just leave me the hell out of it
okay go ahead
he slaps the kid paternally on the ass
get the fuck outta here
as the kid putters away happy again time for the next lucky boy or girl to marcus returns to the velvet rope to find gin slagel waiting stone faced
wheres the grandson
open the rope there marcus
marcus wary hesitates but then lets him through
as they walk toward willie i know you
willie is irked by the arrival of an adult santa dont do grab ass cowboy
gin sits on willies knee
what the fuck
you are willie tugboat soke and you are marcus the prince skidmore
on christmas eve youre gonna rob this store blind
what say we go somewhere private
willie marcus and gin sit in a booth
research thats how
im a department store detective sherlock thats what i do
seven cities in seven years
the stores change your names change
you always get away clean
yeah pretty darn impressive
but lets face facts you all are a couple of half bucket small timers
because of your physical attributes youve found a niche
i respect that
but youve also been caught
so this is the way how we gonna do things
i dont want to take over i dont even want to change your scam
whatever you guys do it works
all i want is a taste
when the deed is done we part ways
i buy a ranch in havasu you take your little medicine show back on the road
sighs how much
willie bolts out of his chair and grabs gin by the neck
now you listen here you marcus pulls him off
just back off willie
i can handle this
after a hard stare willie settles back into his seat
marcus turns his attention to gin okay
theres three of us
i meant thirty three
and a third
forty two five
whats one point
down the middle on the dough and any merchandise you take i look over and cherry pick
moneys one thing but it aint chinese menu jagoff
i tell yea how the way its gonna be

marcus and willie stare at his retreating back as they talk pricks ficks
ah hes a fuckin moron
yeah well i guess thats how you got the upper hand
fuck you you dont like it next year fuck off
i can always get another box jockey
yeah and i can get another midget
marcus turns to willie yeah
you see us hangin off of fuckin trees
like fuckin crab apples
and even if we did youd never front your own racket
cause you got no discipline and zero fuckin initiative
youd fall apart without me
youre just too fuckin pathetic yeah yeah
too fuckin pathetic for words you fuckin loser
and you fuckin know it
willie drags his ass through the front door dejected
let me fix you some sandwiches
he stares at her
his gaze is far away
finally he seems to rouse himself ah fuck it
a hose snaking from an exhaust pipe to the drivers window which is open just far enough to admit it
in his santa suit willie sits in the drivers seat of the idling car staring through the windshield
after a long beat we hear a door opening
the kid stands in the doorway from the house
he looks at willie motionless in the car
willies eyes do not leave the spot in space yeah
whatre you doing
you goin to work today
you just gonna sit there
the kid turns to go
willie bestirs himself kid
willie beckons him
later today when the paramedics come and bag up santa
he displays an envelope
make sure the cops get this letter
it tells about all the bad things that that what the fuck happened to your eye
the kids eye is indeed black and blue
he reaches self consciously up to it
we are pulling an eight year old child who rides his bicycle along the sidewalk looking off struck by what he sees
he slows and then comes to a stop having pulled even with a group of other children gathered on the sidewalk also looking off at the same spot
they stare for a good long beat expressions rather neutral
but the sight whatever it is holds their attention
finally one in the foreground remarks i didnt know he did that
their pov rather distant on a grassy hill a man in a santa suit is pounding the shit out of the bullies
one of the bullies throws a punch but santa grabs his fist and pushes him down
santa puts his foot on another bullys butt and sends him flying
after more wrestling and flinging about the bullies wind up in a heap on the ground
willie a faraway look in his eye sits on a bench near marcus who is finishing putting on his elf outfit
i think ive turned a corner
you fucking petites now
willie dreamy refuses to take the bait no no
no i beat the crap out of some kids today but you know for a purpose
it really made me feel pretty good about myself like i did something constructive for a change
marcus stares at him
you need many years of therapy
many many many many many
many fucking years of therapy
lois her face set in pruney disapproval flips slowly through a rack of furs
a salesman approaches from behind her
she somehow senses his presence without bothering to look around she murmurs just looking
willie and sue come in carrying a few bottles of liquor
willie closes the door and freezes realizing that something is wrong
he hears the tv and heads for the living room
sue follows a few steps behind
willie finds grandma in her chair not moving
he strains through the dim light for any evidence of life
he lets out a sigh and leans in close to listen to her heart
oh my god
willie jumps and screams like a girl
let me fix you some sandwiches
she gets up and heads for the kitchen as willie tries to compose himself
holding his chest no thanks
the kid sleeps
he is awakened by the sounds of stumbling and clanking bottles
he hears giggling more stumbling
he gets up
the kid discovers some clothes
then some more
he follows the trail of clothes towards the sounds coming from the master bedroom
facing the camera willies in his underpants and santa hat lying on the floor on top of sue
hes gripping her panties with his teeth stretching the elastic while he starts pulling them down
the bedroom door opens behind them and the kid walks in
he comes up and stands over them a few steps behind willie
willie freezes panty elastic waistband still stretched out in his teeth
he senses something and his eyes look up from under his santa hat his wolfish smile fades
the kid stands there hands behind his back
lifting her head up hello little boy
frozen teeth still gripping panties yes
i know that christmas eve is in a couple days and you have to fly around and give presents to the world and after that you wont be around no
so i thought id give you your present now
the kid takes his hands from behind his back and extends a small present in crudely taped up wrapping paper
this forces willie to let go of the panties
they snap back
he sits up
he takes the gift and opens it
inside is a roughly whittled crescent of brown wood
mumble what the fuck is it
a wooden pickle
willie stares at it
whyd you paint it brown
its blood from when i cut my hand when i was making it for you
willie stares at it
good night santa
good night mrs
willie still stares at the gift
sue is looking where the kid exited
that was very nice
hes really a nice kid isnt he
she goes back to grabbing him passionately
willie has trouble speaking
hold on a minute
he looks from the wooden pickle up to sue his eyes brim and he starts weeping
i dont know if i can fuck
sue hugs him and strokes his hair
willie abjectly bawls there there
willie hungover half dressed in his santa outfit for work
he fumbles in the refrigerator for some orange juice
the kid comes up behind him clutching a document
willie jumps with a start
you wanna see my report card
willie takes the report card as he tries to compose himself
he looks at it
all cs and one b
think i did good
willies eyes drift back to the card and settle on comments
they read thurman has an active inquiring mind
and no friends
who the fuck is thurman
this is you
your names thurman
incredulous thurman merman
back to the report card you think i did good
willie does not want to engage
whaddya you care what i think anyway
pause relenting a bit what do i fuckin know
better than i ever did
i never got any bs i thought maybe since at least i did good in school youll bring me a present this year
cause last christmas and the one before that you didnt bring no presents
this is a lot for willie to hear
even though im a dipshit loser
a beat then explodes jesus fucking christ kid
why do talk about yourself like that
what the fuck is that about
whats with you anyway
i aint fucking santa claus
look at me i am living fucking proof that there aint no santa claus
i know theres no santa
i just thought maybe youd wanna give me a present cause were friends
an uncomfortable silence
willie is most uncomfortable
pause then sincerely to the kid look kicking the shit out of those kids thats as generous as i can get
the kid just nods and doesnt say anything
willie cant take it
willie runs out of the room very upset willie grabs a bottle of whiskey off the counter and hurries out slamming the door
marcus checks his watch impatiently as the endless line of excited children and their parents impatiently murmurs
the tension is suffocating marcus
finally a gasp goes up from the crowd
marcus looks up to see willie totally shit faced
his costume is half on his undergarments are showing and his hand clutches the neck of a broken bottle
willie stumbles over a burro and falls into a pile of fake snow
he rises to his feet and begins to pummel the statue
you fuckin spic
children scream in horror as mothers cover their eyes
gin enters the wonderland and takes in the spectacle
sweet jews for jesus
willie finishes dispatching the burro and stumbles to his santa chair
marcus stomps up to him
what do you think youre doing
sobbing i pissed my pants
marcus pounces on him
you son of a bitch
gin pulls marcus off
alright lets get him out of here
ill go smooth this over with chipeska
food poisoning something
the two men face each other their voices rising
beyond them we see the line of children staring at them
what do you mean get him out of here
take him to his car
in case you hadnt noticed im a motherfuckin dwarf
so unless you got a forklift handy maybe you should lend a hand
that figures you wantin all kinds of set asides and special treatment cause of your handicap
youre all the same
im three fucking feet tall asshole its a matter of physics
draw me a sketch how i get him to the car
gin notices the line of kids staring
he puts up a sign that reads santa has gone to feed his reindeer
hell be back soon
sketch it up fuckin moron
fuckin leonardo da vinci
what did you call me thigh high
i called you a fuckin guinea homo
from the fifteenth fuckin century
i could stick you up my ass smallfry
you sure it aint too sore from last night
you got some lip on you midget
well it was on your wifes pussy last night
why dont you dust that thing once in a while
marcus sits with lois in the van staking out the door to chamberlains waiting for gin to leave
willie sleeps it off behind a flimsy cardboard set
marcus and lois continue their stake out
we see gin exit the store and head for his car
there he is
that lousy leatherfaced dago motherfucker
marcus stands by the side of his van
its parked on the shoulder with the hood up jumper cables attached and hanging
lois is in the drivers seat
gins ford x speeds around the corner and marcus flags him down
gin slams on the brakes then backs up and pulls over
he emerges from the x with road rage on full brew and strides over to the van
jesus mother mary and joseph
what in the name of the holy lord fuck is the problem now
sorry the van stalled
give us a jump will ya
well ill be dipped in dogshit
what am i your auto mechanic now
he shakes his head in disgust
grumbling he goes back to the x and drives it into position
he gets out and raises the hood
the two vehicles face each other nose to nose several feet apart as gin opens the hood
motions to his battery help yourself small fry
marcus seems to have a little difficulty reaching the battery terminals
its hard for me to reach
gin grabs the cables from him
marcus takes a few steps back
jesus christ give me those
gin attaches the cables
then to lois alright try it
lois turns the key and the van starts right up
gin takes the cables off the van and closes the hood
he lights up a pall mall
marcus signals to lois
she puts the car into gear and stomps her foot on the accelerator squashing gin between the two vehicles
gins face as its squooshed up against the vans windshield
a cloud of cigarette smoke escapes his lips
lois continues to step on the gas trying to crush him
angle on the tires spinning in the gravel
finally she takes her foot off the gas
the van eases back
gin falls to the ground with a groan
marcus steps up and leans over him
oh my what a terrible accident
is he dead
no but it looks like you broke most of his ribs
then leaning down to gin
for gins benefit id say maybe
fifty percent of them
or do you think thirty percent
i needed more of a running start i couldnt build up any speed
marcus paces around trying to figure out what to do next
shaking his head in dismay motherfuck
he grabs the jumper cables still connected to gins x and clamps the other ends on gins ears
a small jolt and a spark or two
only a minor shock
he grabs gins arm and with great effort drags him over a few feet so that his head is positioned behind the front tire of the van
gin tries to crawl out of the way
angle on gins feet slipping on the gravel
put it in reverse
angle on shift level moving into reverse
angle on lois foot stepping on the gas pedal
wider lois drives backwards
theres a bump and the sound of a dull pop
close up a large bubble gum bubble pops
willie in a self medicated stupor barely managing to hold a wailing toddler on his lap
bubble gum is all over the kids face
tendo it is
he passes the child off to marcus who holds it as willie gazes off and murmurs everything i touch turns to shit and dies
marcus still holding the child quickly glances around and then hisses into willies ear what are you drinking sterno now
cause youre sounding like my aunt tilly right before she smeared her own shit on the bedroom walls and we had to lock her up and she spent the rest
of her life with a shaved head and eating lunch through a tube up her nose
willie continues to stare head swaying
you better be in shape by this evening fat man
after tonight i dont give a shit
but this is the time to reach deep down and suck it up
marcus hands the kid to his mother
he smiles warmly
jolly old saint nicholas plays as a buzzing throng of people crams the mall
one current in this sea of humanity flows into the bedecked entrance of chamberlains department store
jesse the security guard is at his post near the doors to the parking lot
he smiles and waves farewell to departing shoppers
attention shoppers the store will be closing in five minutes
we wish you all a merry christmas happy chanukah and a joyous kwanza
behind jesse in mens wear is lois wearing a frown of pruney disapproval
seeing that hes not looking she inexplicably nudges a table of sweaters a few feet over
the table makes a loud noise but its too chaotic on the floor for anyone to notice
satisfied with her placement of the table lois heads out the door
bleary eyed willie puts down a little girl and she happily scampers off
barbie it is
willie turns to marcus
marcus moves the backdrop to reveal the air vent
willie cracks open an ampule of amyl nitrate and inhales deeply
marcus grimaces oh christ
red faced holding breath lets do it
with the sound of closing circuits banks of light systematically shut down in the various departments of the now empty
exhausted employees file out of the store past jesse
eventually willie emerges
merry christmas willie
up your ass
jesse heads for the alarm panel near the doorway and punches the key labeled arm
an led readout labeled arming counts down from seconds
jesse exits the store locking the door and heading home
the cubicles are now empty and the office is still but we hear dwarf shimmy in the ducts overhead
by the front door the alarm continues to count down
marcus arrives at the vent above the surveillance room
he reaches in his pocket pulls out the remote control lois bought and aims it down into the room
the huge bank of vcrs powers down
marcus arrives at the precipice of a descending duct
he snaps on a biking helmet and takes a deep breath
he dives down the duct
we pan and whip pivot along the outside of several lengths of ductwork following the muffled scream of a thousand girlies echoing inside
the ductwork dimples out along the bottom with the wubba sound of flopping aluminum as marcuss weight travels its length at turns marcuss inertial force makes one side of the
duct momentarily dent out
we thus follow marcuss progress as he slides bumps ricochets and barrels through the department store
as the alarm continues to count down
a distant scream grows louder until in nearby mens wear the vent in the foot ceiling bursts open and marcus drops from the duct
he lands on the table of sweaters placed by lois
in a split second he sits up and looks at the alarm box
he hops off the table and pushes it toward the alarm box
the far side of the table smashes into the wall beneath the alarm box
marcus kicks out the collapsible legs on the near side making that edge of the table crash to the ground creating a ramp
he sprints away from the table spins and runs back towards it
he runs up the ramp and
leaps and slaps the cancel button just in time
elevator doors open to reveal willie and marcus holding sections of the disassembled water drill
the lights flicker on in the accounting office as willie and marcus wheel the water drill over to the safe
once they get it there oh shit
what what what what
its a kitnerboy redoubt
willie stares at the safe
you know andy pitts
yeah andy pizzarelli
no andy lapitski
andy pizzarelli is andy blue balls
huh uh since he got married they call him an whats your fucking andy lapitski can get into anything
they say hes been in margaret thatchers pussy
in the joint he told me that the kitnerboy
he nods at the safe
cannot be cracked
are you fuckin shittin me
are you tellin me after ive propped you up and held you together and smiled for all those kids and danced for all those fucking housewives in a fucking lime
green fucking velvet elf costume you cannot get in that willie continues to stare at the safe
he licks his lips
im saying its gonna take me a minute
willie stares at the safe while rubbing sandpaper to his fingertips
meanwhile marcus emerges from a stockroom with a cart to begin his shopping spree
willie applies a stethoscope to the safe tapping with one hand and listening intently
marcus starts in ladies accessories finding the cashmere scarf
willie applies the drill to the safe
marcus makes his way through lingerie
willie pulls back the drill
the bit is trashed the safe is completely unscathed
marcus is in shoes picking out pumps for lois
willie is in home improvement flipping tools off the shelves into a cart of his own
marcus is in evening wear jumping to try to pull a stole off a mannequin
willie batters a chisel into the seam of the safe door
marcus continues to leap at the mannequin
willie is atop the safe swinging a sledgehammer at the lock
marcus swings at the mannequins knees with a golf club
willie uses a plasma welder on the safe
marcus having chopped down the mannequin drags off its stole
willie is back over the safe battering it with the sledgehammer roaring with each swing
marcus is in housewares pilfering crock pots
willie sweating drops the sledgehammer clanking to the floor
wiping his forehead he circles the safe
when he gets to the back of the safe he stops thinks
marcus is in home entertainment grabbing a stereo
willie is hunched at the back of the safe stethoscope to its surface giving exploratory taps with two knuckles
sound perspective through the stethoscope hollow thunks followed by an unnaturally loud and present creeeeeeeeak
willie reacts quizzically
after a considering moment he rises
we can see on the far side of the safe its door as it finishes creaking open
marcus enters the room
willie looks at him
piece of cake
marcus starts removing stacks of cash and loading them into the santa sack
willie wipes sweat off his forehead
ill be right back
i gotta grab one thing
we are looking at a big fuzzy smiling pink stuffed elephant
willies hand hesitates between this elephant and the one behind which is purple
we hear him muttering shit
which did he say
the hand finally leaves with the purple elephant
we hold for a long beat
the hand reenters to put back the purple and take the pink
willie turns around holding the stuffed elephant
marcus and lois are standing there presenting a grotesque picture lois has a shopping cart filled with shoes scarves jewels a salad spinner purses a block of ginsu knives an
she wears a pair of sunglasses from which a price tag dangles and a long ermine stole
next to her marcus holds the santa bag bulging with indeed sprouting cash
well i dont think that store dick is gonna want this
store dick dont want shit
something in this picture makes willie uneasy
he licks his lips
wuddya mean fucking guys greedier than
he pauses searching
greedier than fuck
marcus and lois are statues staring at him
store dick dead
store dick dont want shit
a long silence
fuck the fuckin store dick
willies tone is wooden dead huh
again he licks his lips
i didnt even know he was sick
marcus flicks his coat front away and pulls a
out of his waistband
this has been a long time comin
every year youre worse
every year less reliable
more butt fucking
the three ba
you gotta be able to rely willie
he primes the gun
willie murmurs more in sadness than in fear youre monsters
marcus points the gun

willie squeezes his eyes shut
from nowhere drop the gun munchkin

marcus looks wildly around
where did you come from
willie slaps his forehead
all three of you are in so much shit its almost unbelievable
well comen get us coppers
ha ha ha ha
the cops return fire
he ducks clutching the elephant to his chest and scurries behind a counter
fuck me fuck me fuck me
gunfire fills the air
exploding merchandise chases along the counter behind willie as the cops seek to put him down
under the gunfire we hear marcuss maniacal laughter
willie reaches the end of the counter
a brief open space separates him from a stairwell he dashes across as gunfire redoubles and plunges down the stairs
willie bursts out onto the loading dock still holding the elephant
he dives into his mercedes and peels out
rounding the corner of the loading dock willie comes upon a fleet of squad cars idling in the street
cops yell draw their guns and fire as willie clips a couple cars skids and slues and finally is clear of the pack
he roars up the road as policemen leap for their vehicles crank up their sirens and pursue
willie drives his jaw set a desperate man in a santa suit
he glances up at the rearview which shows many flashing light bars
and the fucking kid is getting his present
willies car corners onto sage terrace on two wheels slams back down onto four fishtails up to the kids house and squeals braking into its driveway
the police vehicles in hot pursuit squeal skid and slew around in a jumble at the foot of the lawn
cops leap out of their cars just as willie jumps from his
halt put your hands up
willie is sprinting up the walk toward the front door
his voice echoes lone and weak after the boom of the megaphone up your ass
he bounds up the stoop
all right boys nail him
a ripple of gunfire
at the top of the stoop facing the door willie staggers rolls his eyes and drops
drawn by the noise an adorable six year old in a nearby house slides open his second story bedroom window to look
frozen in a semi circle at the foot of the neighboring lawn an army of cops has guns trained on the felled santa claus who is sprawled on the neighbors
his hand stretches toward the front door holding a fluffy pink elephant un delivered
the six year old draws in his breath and screams
he is joined by his equally adorable little brother and sister who look and scream with him
somewhere a neighborhood dog barks
a cop looks up at the window and the three shrieking children
somebody put a zipper on those fuckin kids
after a long beat willies voice dear kid
i hope that you got my present and that there wasnt too much blood on it although there was blood on the present you gave me which didnt keep me
from enjoying it so maybe the blood doesnt matter so much i guess
we are fading in on a shelf in the kids bedroom where the stuffed elephant sits in a place of honor its fur indeed stiff and stained with dried blood
the kids bedroom is no longer in disarray things are neat and comfy
we pan off of it to find this letter crudely handwritten tacked up on a little bulletin board
anyway just in case they took it as evidence i am also sending you a t shirt
i hope its the right size
i am healing up good and they tell me that i will soon be one hundred percent even with eight bullets dug out of me because they didnt hit any
vital organs just my liver which is fucked anyway ha ha ha
our continuing pan brings us to the open door of the bedroom and we hear the sound of the tv in the living room
we track toward it
thank you for giving that letter to the cops
i forgot i asked you to do it but its a good thing you did or santas little helper wouldve plugged his ass
and now the cops know i wrote it which is gonna keep my ass out of jail
that plus everyone agreeing that the phoenix police department shooting an unarmed santa was even more fucked up than rodney king
the cops are treating me like fucking royalty now which is new in my experience
they are gonna make me a sensitivity counselor so that tragedies like this will never again embarrass the whole fucking department
grandma is in the living room watching tv
we track past her towards the jacuzzi area
as for my little helper i am sorry to have to tell you that him and his prune faced mail order wife are gonna be exploring mountains with your dad
i hope your dad doesnt go sucking shit from them like i did
meanwhile i told the cops you had no one to take the fuck care of you so they set it up with mrs
santas sister watching you till your dad gets back in one year and three months
they made her a guardian pro temp or some such shit
anyway she makes better money than bartending and seems to like you and your house and jacuzzi
sue is in a towel holding a highball as she climbs out of the jacuzzi
the kid walks by her carrying a bucket
she tousles his hair affectionately as he goes by
hes never looked better
we track towards the foyer
its empty but the front door is open
we track towards it
we go out the front door
so ill be staying in phoenix now telling the police how screwed up they are which is not a bad job as jobs go
theyre supposed to let me out of this hospital room soon so ill see you when i come over to fuck mrs
santas sister in the jacuzzi
until then dont take no shit from nobody
least of all yourself
see ya soon
the kid is dipping a toilet bowl brush into a bucket of soapy water on the front stoop
as the kid turns and hunkers down to scrub the dried blood off the stoop we see the back of his t shirt
