a rusted out lincoln rattles down the bleak boulevard
in it joe stevens an angry black man in his late s beside him his year old son joe joe jr
stares out the window at passing boarded buildings whores with raincoats over their heads trying to flag down a john a black santa a knot of drinkers
breaking the silence your mother okay
they stop at a light
joe stevens tries to furtively snort a little something
he spots joe jr
firm without irony dont you do this shit boy
dont you ever fuckin touch it you hear me
stares silent joe jr
s about to hit him
continuing you hear me goddam it
the boy nods
satisfied joe sr
draws in the stuff
it makes him feel good strong worried and determined all at once
continuing charged up what do you want for christmas
i dont know
light changes he accelerates you dont know
you gotta know what you want boy if you ever expect to get it
a sudden charm to his bravado
grins back pulls up in front of a liquor store
continuing wait here
this wont take a minute
doesnt notice or doesnt remark that his father just before entering the store draws a handgun from beneath his coat
the boy gazes dreamily at the street
the lunatic black santa marches by ranting to himself then the white man say
the rain hammers on the roof and windshield
breathes on the glass fogging the scene
from the store muffled gunfire
looks that way
another gunshot then his father comes out the door clutching money in one hand
he strides toward the car with a reckless pride
he doesnt notice the liquor store door opens behind him
a shotgun blast
joe stevens guts splatter onto the car windshield
a look of terrible amazement he sinks to his knees
he jumps from the car kneels by his father
the store owner slavic drags the gun toward them bleeding profusely
enraged almost to tears fuckin niggers
looks at the money in his hand two s two s
fifty goddam bucks
looks up at his son im sorry
he stuffs the blood soaked bills in the boys shirt pocket and dies
looks up at
bloody nearly unconscious he aims the shotgun at the boy who is too frightened to move
the man dies on his feet
as he falls backward he pulls the trigger the blast shattering the car windows
cop cars squeal up
uniformed cops leap out guns drawn survey the scene
then one notices joe jr
staring motionless at his father and the store owner dead together
on his but older harder colder
theyre concentrating on a paper before him
hundreds of true false questions
i have never indulged in any unusual sexual practices
i have often felt that strangers were looking at me critically
when i was young i occasionally stole things
t f joe stevens marks these true false false then comes to
a persons station in life is at least partially determined by his race
t f we are thirty seven black cleveland police officers many in uniform including joe are taking the mmpi
some roll their eyes at the questions
some try to copy answers
others like joe work with rapid concentration
but he gets stuck on
marks it false
marks it true
goes on to
at times i hear so well it bothers me
t f he marks that true
gerald carver an ambitious government lawyer with a relaxed vaguely hip manner looks over the file of the ingratiating black officer sitting across the desk from him
you know the difference between a black man and nigger
leland is startled insulted but doesnt want to blow the interview
he smiles weakly shakes his head no
continuing pleasant smile yeah most niggers dont
stung leland tries to laugh
carver puts his file aside picks up another
continuing nice to meet you
a second black officer is powerfully built politically conscious takes no shit
carvers leafing through his file
so winston whats the difference between a black man and a nigger
winston is out of his chair before the question is finished drags carver by the shirt front halfway across the desk and hisses into his face who the fuck do
you think youre talking to
carver smiles cheerfully past winstons cocked fist
thanks for coming in
nonplussed by this cool dismissal winston stalks out
carver picks up the next file unfazed
joe stevens watches carver reading his file and waiting for an answer
when none is forthcoming carver glances up finds stevens looking right back at him
the niggers the one who falls for your bullshit
he says it pleasantly without belligerence
carver smiles hes found his man
he offers his hand
gerald carver united states district attorney
call me gerry
on a tv screen a grainy black and white tape date and time stamped at the bottom
a grungy street palm trees
the light from the monitor dimly illuminates carver and stevens
on screen the camera finds a man in jeans sneakers and sweatshirt on a street corner
he ought to be wearing a sign
you can tell hes a cop
stevens laughs its obvious
a real drug dealer joins the cop
undercover cop you got it
dealer in the motel right over here
the cops uneasy keeps glancing back toward the camera as they go
he keeps looking for his back up
now the other guy knows it too
then whys he taking him to the room
to rip him off
carver studies stevens in the darkness impressed
on screen the figures disappear into the motel
we hear their voices
dealer here try some of it
undercover cop uhh
no i dont
dealer why not you sonofabitch
two bursts of sound distortion
a plainclothes cop taft black stocky powerful bolts from behind the camera sprints toward the motel
the camera wobbles after him
continuing too late
on screen the camera jerky hand held nears the open motel door
taft is bent over the undercover cops body
to the camera get an ambulance and back up
he slams the wall starts past the camera
carver pushes the pause button the tape freezes on a jerky image of tafts face
focussed on taft who is he
hes a good cop
hes a great cop
two names citation and a another citation
as tough as they come and twice as honest
carver watches stevens watch taft smiles at something
but the cops arent getting it done here are they
gotta try something new
he opens a manila envelope dumps the contents on the desk drivers license social security card high school transcript prison records
all in the name of william g
continuing whos john hull
if you want to be
off stevens most undercover guys dont know what theyre doing because its a day gig
indicates dead cop on tv i need somebody who goes under and stays there six months a year five years
what does he have to do
feed me information
hes a snitch
hes a drug dealer
but for the right side
beat i want you to come to los angeles on loan to the justice department as a federal agent
your experience there will be credited toward your seniority here
and youll come back to cleveland a p or higher
uncomfortable i cant do that
ive got a wife and kids
youre separated from your wife shes filled for divorce
you see your kids every other weekend
stevens takes a breath this is awkward to explain
almost a confession all my life ive stayed away from that stuff
ive never touched drugs
tolerant come on a little grass
i never even had a drink
his motto never have never will
you dont understand
i made a choice in my life
whats to understand
you saw your father killed when you were ten and you decided you wouldnt be like that
off stevens surprise carver grins im god i know everything
you wanted to be a good boy so you became a cop
hiding out in uniform
thats why you got the hard on for taft
its not that simple
opening joes file as if reluctantly ill tell the truth joe
youre never going to be a taft
i dont believe that
but he does
looks at mmpi results you ever take a look at your psychological profile
you score almost like a criminal
reading resents authority
i do not
exaggerated moral standards but with no underlying value system
look at the anger the repressed violence its almost off the scale
let me see that
carver hands him the scores which are of course just clusters of numbers
stevens is upset though oddly unsurprised as if this only confirmed his secret fears
whyd you join the force
awkward but felt i wanted to be of use
well now you can be
you wont be taft but maybe youll be something more
sits back theres a man named ramon gallegos who supplies of the cocaine to the west coast
hes smart smooth and sufficiently elusive that we dont even have an adult photograph of him
however his uncle is hector guzman an important latin american political figure
gallegos uses uncles connections to get product into the country and everyone weve sent after him has ended up like that
indicates dead body on tv
why would i be different
you already are thats the point
indicates file test scores youve got the ability and the personality to go underground and blend in completely
thats what the others couldnt
some part of them showed
thats why theyre dead
see theres only one rule in this game
stevens raises his eyebrows what
continuing dont blow your cover
stevens parks outside a small well maintained house
as he gets out he spots a group of kids black and hispanic playing down the street
hes not pleased about that
calls to them joe j carmen
a boy and a girl both light skinned run to him shouting daddy jump into his arms competing for attention as if they havent seen him in ages
what were you doing with those kids
displeased your mom lets you play with them
his strictness has already sobered their enthusiasm
sensing this he attempts to embrace them which he can do only awkwardly
meanwhile his wife terry southern white has come out the screen door
she and stevens bristle at each other
i thought we talked about this
the older brother up theres got a sheet with lay off it
theyre just kids
both are ready to fight but restrain themselves
a big polynesian tito comes out the door
a moment of surprise then he gets it
he looks to terry
she gives a little shrug refusing to be embarrassed
stevens is trying to seem interested in carmens little drawings
theyre real nice honey
is that a horse
its a bunny
she puts her arms around him
continuing i dont want you to go away daddy
its my work
ive got to
over her shoulder he sees terry sitting with a subdued joe j
her face seems to say see i told you
avoiding this accusation stevens notices a bruise on carmens arm
continuing what happened to you there baby
tito did it
instantly outraged he hit you
up in a fury god damn it whats he doing touching her
terry intercepts him on his way out of the room
she was running behind his chair when he got up
it was an accident
hes uncertain a complete
stevens looks at carmen who giggles
hes humiliated by his own temper attempts to calm himself
terry puts a sympathetic hand on his shoulder
the immense sprawl the arterial flow of the freeways the blinding light
people getting off among them the former joe stevens now known as john hull
hes carrying a suitcase
hull goes up the stairs onto a downtown street
a year old black youth selling drugs through a car window
hull walks by
hes at ease looking around his manner subtly announcing that he belongs here just as in the train station he seemed to belong among the commuters
a fat blonde woman large white glasses tiny shoes leads hull down a corridor
i was on sky king twice ramar of the jungle
that was a silly show
the jungle was mostly flats
they pass an open door where a year old boy james a latchkey sits on the stoop playing gameboy inside his mother belinda a broken down whore is doing her
nails and drinking pepsi
she looks up bats her lashes at hull
continuing you want my advice id stay away from that bitch
she opens the door to the room across the hall
hull walks in drops his duffle hell take it
the blonde lounges in the doorway
he closes the door
hull empties his pockets on the dresser
looks at his money room key identification
looks at himself in the mirror
he touches his clothes his face tries on different expressions
note throughout the film hull continually checks himself out in mirrors both to adjust his appearance to the circumstances and as if in an attempt to recall who he really
on the seam between south central and usc
lots of people out children students dealers whores
hull with a new haircut
dealers most in mid teens meeting cars making transactions
all this casually observed
eddie comes up the street reciting his version of an old street toast
on the day of the kings castration all the counts and no accounts were down on the deck with georgia tech taking turns in the back seat
those dealers not at car windows gather around
he never speaks to them goes on declaiming as he exchanges drugs for money
hull watches talking to another street person
his appearance continues to change clothes posture walk gestures subtly conform to the environment a bit like zelig
throughout the film his appearance shifts depending on who hes with
we always recognize him but each time hes different
he walks up to a dealer makes a quick buy and keeps going
but he sees them and is seen
hull drops eleven foil balls on a green blotter
carver counts out money for him
he sits at the window eating a burrito watching little james play in the courtyard
hull approaches another dealer the year old seen earlier angelic face
like hull hes trying to act tough
whatta you got
voice just changing nickel rock dime rock
hull exchanges a folded twenty for two foil balls
he walks off
he has gone twenty feet when
squeals to a stop opposite the dealer
a huge young black man ivy all in red with a red headband leans out the passenger window shouting at the year old
what the fuck i tell you about being here
everyone turns to look but hulls view is blocked
too fuckin late
ivy is waving an automatic weapon
everyone on the street but hull has hit the ground
enjoying it shouting get down motherfuckers
ivy laughs and fondles a girlfriend as the car roars off
he sees hull pretends to fire laughs as hull too ducks
when ivys gone he runs to where a crowd has gathered around
lying in the street a bullet hole in his head eyes open
he twitches and kicks blood pulsing from the neat wound
then hes dead
the faces around him young old many races watch with a variety of emotions
who is he
whyd they shoot him
ivy did him man
hes in the wrong fuckin place
that poor boy
get his beeper
cops push through to the body
as the crowd disperses hull cant take his eyes off the boy
when he finally does he sees eddie drink in hand
their eyes meet and eddie a rapper raises his eyebrows in brief acknowledgment of sorrow
sadly he done done aint he
a bar with a neon bird for a sign
a racial mix
hull takes a seat at the bar
stuffed birds line the lintel above the bottles
a female bartender long red nails greets him familiarly
hows it going john
im in there
without being asked she sets him up a dry sack with a long red straw
note he never touches the drink
hulls appearance has continued to change
his clothes have become flashier he has an earring the start of a goatee
eddie approaches the bar compulsively reciting one of his toasts
to himself wheres the queen said the king
shes in bed with laryngitis
is that bastard still in town
fuck the queen said the king and ten thousand knights straaaained at their utmost
to the bartender pina colada times two and a white wine
he goes on muttering under his breath tapping his foot like any crankhead
he notices hull greets him as someone he cant place but knows hes seen around
continuing how you doin dudley
tries to remember name
john man right
eddie takes his drinks carries them to
where he rejoins a white man david elias s slick powerful and a well dressed black woman mid s good looking
she gets the wine
elias rises to let her out
as the woman passes hull on her way to the restrooms their eyes meet an instant of perfect chemistry
her features open grow sensual for a moment but then as if seeing something she doesnt like her eyes flick away and she walks by as if he werent there
note hull invariably meets carver in this anonymous room distinguished only by the green blotter and a view of the city
this simple regularity suggest visits to a psychiatrist carver probing testing teasing trying to draw hull out
and they feel like therapy at once a respite and a torment
more foil balls on the blotter beside boxes of x photographs
photos of eddie and david elias are up on a corkboard the beginning of a pyramid
he supplies the street dealers
buys from him
reads name on back of photo david elias
who apparently buys from a guy named barbolla or something
but i havent seen him
carver produces a photo of a handsome latin in his s pins it on the board above elias
there was also a woman but shes not here
as carver reaches in a drawer i saw a kid killed
twelve thirteen at the most
carver shrugs these things happen
he hands hull a lot of cash much more than expected
hull does understand
get to elias
then to barbosa
you cant rush this stuff
rush it please
i want art john not reality
budget hearings start in april and i need gallegos by then
they wont give us funding for three ounce buys
were not just doing this for the funding are we
without funding we arent doing it at all
virtual darkness save splinters of light between the curtains
pipes burn here and there in the gloom
ten or fifteen crackheads huddle around a battery operated tv on which tom brokaw is narrating an nbc documentary on drugs
a year old sits against a wall too stoned even for television
hull approaches eddie regally installed on an automobile bench seat cum sofa a lit pipe in one hand
we barely notice the redhead kneeling between his legs face buried in his crotch
he greets hull from wrecked bliss
they know each other now
my man dudley hes so fud ley
hull greets eddie some of the others drops familiarly onto an adjacent auto seat
the patrons are making fun of brokaw laughing exchanging fives
eddie man i need
eddie holds up a hand telling hull to wait
his mind is elsewhere
his features contract in brief concentration
whatever happened to that drug czar motherfucker
he gave up cause he finally realized he didnt know nothing about any of that shit
more laughter etc
eddies concentration peaks breaks off into a sigh and a smile
eddie sings a satisfied little song
the redhead rises from eddies crotch and we see its a boy seventeen going on death he might have been pretty a year ago
eddie passes him the crack pipe lets him suck greedily for a few seconds before ripping it out of his scabrous mouth and offering it to hull who with a
grimace that gets laughs declines
the others continue to watch and comment on the speech
so what is it you need so bad blood
need need need
a whole k quick as you can get it
impressed a trace of envy comin in the world dudley
winning grin all because of my man
eddie likes that holds out a hand
hull hits it
give me a day
hull nods rises
continuing stick around let the bitch hoover you too
in all these scenes hull acts indifferent to the horror but here the effort costs him
he masters his disgust with a joke
only if you clorox him first
everyone laughs even the boy
eddie comes out the back door of a building is immediately collared by taft the cop on the videotape
hes in his mid s stocky balding
cheerful gregarious eddie shitface
where you been boy
eddie breaks free runs three feet before hernandez a muscular mexican knees him in the groin
continuing eddie i dont think i introduced you to my new partner michael hernandez
pleased to meet you mr
eddie folded over his wounded nuts
hernandez and taft sit on crates to either side
the drugs theyve taken from him are neatly arranged on a garbage can lid
you have the right to remain silent
you have the right to an attorney
you have the right to go back to ontario for eight to ten on a second offense
in several kinds of pain oh man i cant go back in there i just cant
soothing course you cant child course you cant
thats why youre gonna start giving us some help
a pleasant santa monica neighborhood
spanish style house
eliass wife nancy dressed like the attorney she is sits in an alcove study reading a real estate contract through half glasses
elias himself is helping his daughter miranda with her homework
he is with the body and bearing of a powerful man
three times four
elias is not a sweet daddy
it should make us uncomfortable to watch him push his daughter
youre adding again you have to multiply
three and four is seven
three times four is
three times five
can you get that
getting up more about the answer than the door damn it
why cant i just use a calculator
three men felix barbosa whose photo we saw in carvers office
barbosa is a veteran of the coke business but hes doing too much of the drug now hes sweating paranoid unstable
with him is gopher early s a wizened high voiced old con who barbosa keeps the way spanish kings kept dwarfs for amusement and luck like the court jester gopher
can say anything he wants without fear
behind them is an hispanic kid chino a thug
elias knows them all but is not happy to see them at his door
what are you doing here
weve got a problem david
call me on the phone
your friend eddie just started bending over for the cops
this is very bad news
elias murmurs a shaken shit
and steps outside half closing the door behind him
continuing they busted him and hes dealing to save his ass
which is how hell lose the skinny little thing
did he give us up
not yet but he will if he has to and eventually hell have to
i thought we were doing my homework
i dont think hed talk about us

to miranda just a second
to barbosa not yet
let me check on this first
taunting nobody said you had to do the dirty work david
ill take care of felix if hes a problem well kill him
ill kill him myself
he doesnt realize until its too late that nancy has just then opened the front door to see where he went
they look at each other a terrible moment she knows what he does hates it cant bring herself to leave him hates herself for that
continuing nancy get out of here
for you its eddie
she hands him a cordless phone goes inside closing the door
you got a tasty wife david
no wonder you dont want us coming here
warning him dont talk about her that way
he cant help it david its his nature

elias joins eddie and hull to one side
in the b
two guys sparring

taft and hernandez watching the gym
hull comes out looks up and down the street carefully
taft sits up pays attention
this is our collar
continuing who is he
but taft clearly thinks theres something different about hull
hes not sure what but it troubles him
note hull makes a little move that taft will later realize was a cops move
for now he cant quite place it
eddie pleading his case to elias
hes no cop david
hes an animal
you see his eyes
you never see a cop with those eyes
i know this shit man you dont

twenty six thousand cash is what

elias studies eddie is he a rat
elias hopes not but hes going to find out
he hands a fat federal express envelope through the window
a warning i want him to get it all eddie
eddie bows in gratitude hurries off
hulls unlocking his door when belinda the hooker across the hall comes out to talk
her year old james watches silent
a crackhead mr
wearily whats happening belinda
now you know mr
hull i was to the welfare this afternoon but the bus you know what im saying

i couldnt give up my boy for less than four thousand
hull is rescued from this horror by the ringing pay phone
he runs down the hall grabs it
he dashes past belinda into his room
or you could just give me a part now
he closes the door takes the money carver gave him out from behind the mirror dashes back outside
as he rushes by continuing let me do somethin for you mr
let me do a little somethin for you
he keeps going
the blonde woman addresses belinda
no solicitin in the halls
i told you that before
spunkier than weve seen i aint doin shit
a handful of customers under a mud sky
the throb of a distant helicopter
hull pulls into the lot beside eddies bmw
he climbs into the bmw tosses eddie a brown envelope money spills onto his lap
eddie does a quick count produces the fed ex envelope
the usual white stuff
hulls about to taste when the chopper swoops in with a sudden blinding overhead light
a bullhorn booms down like the voice of god
this is the police
remain inside the vehicle
place your open hands against the windshield so that they are clearly visible
a strategy spread the floor dudley
rap sound effects with rhythmic head spasms a ga a ga a ga a ga
eddie starts the car and hull rolls out the passenger door as the bmw races across the lot
two black and whites and an unmarked converge on the stand
hull cant reach his car
he vaults a metal rail and runs off between two buildings
hernandez jumps out of an unmarked and races after him
taft speeds the car out onto the street
police and sirens pursuing
he hurls the fed ex envelope into a dumpster
helicopter light sweeps over him
as he cuts around a building taft opens a car door right into his face
hull goes down hard
into car radio thank you kindly
he waves at the helicopter which goes away kneels over hull who is twitching spastically on the ground gasping for air
hernandez arrives carrying the fed ex envelope
continuing how you doin child
hull is astonished to look up and see taft looming over him the man he remembers from the videotape
he tries to speak barely audible you
briefly puzzled me
of course its me
you know me
hull shakes head winces
continuing hurts huh
hull tries to curse
continuing here i want to show you something
you have kids
he takes out his wallet opens it to pictures of his two children a boy and a girl seven and eight
continuing these are mine
arent they the most beautiful children you ever saw
hull groans twists in pain
taft sticks the pictures in his face
hull is affected by the children despite everything
continuing yeah i know they kind of leave you speechless
so let me ask if someone put a gun to your babys head wouldnt you kill him if you could
hull just looks up
continuing me too
and youre the bastard with the gun
he takes the fed ex envelope from him
hoarse his first words you know the difference between a nigger and a black man
dont jive me boy
the niggers the one covers whiteys ass by puttin the brothers in jail
taft yanks him hard to his feet hull cries out in pain
you aint my brother
hull is led in with other handcuffed prisoners
carver is here catches hulls eye
hull shakes his head doesnt want carver to intercede
a woman public defender attractive harried addresses the prisoners
hi im shelley weissbrod
this is only an arraignment a preliminary hearing but if you dont have money for an attorney the public defenders office can
hull is listening to this when a bailiff taps his shoulder
youve got counsel
puzzled hull sees the back of a suit conferring with a prosecutor
the suit turns
its david elias who smiles offers his hand
hull is stunned
elias enjoys that
youre a lawyer
im your lawyer
who hired you
smiles its pro bono
if you dont want me theres shelley
she just cant provide special services
calling the next case john hull
getting your case called first
elias addressing the court
continuing your honor i believe the preliminary police toxicology report will show that the substance seized from my client was mannitol a baby laxative
we move for immediate dismissal
hull is surprised at this news
the judge looks to the prosecutor who waives objection
continuing to hull were out of here dude
as they walk toward the back taft approaches hull
theres already a deep pull between these two and in tafts presence hull cant sustain the tough street act
we almost see the little boy inside him
to hull amused baby laxative they sold you some bad shit
to hull you have a constipated baby and youre in jail
what kind of a father are you
a father who dont know his own children aint that right
a long look between them broken when elias takes hulls arm leads him away
elias cheerfully greets a couple of hookers waiting arraignment
hull furtively grabs his sleeve
under his breath you sold me mannitol motherfucker
under his if it hadnt been asshole youd be in jail right now
come on i want you to meet some people
the place is closed
a couple of cars in the lot
eliass bmw pulls in
deserted except for one table where eddie barbosa gopher and chino are eating shrimp
they look up as hull and elias approach
eddies astonished to see hull
dudley dudley fo fudley
surprised to see him eddie
eddie looks around uneasy
continuing john got busted and kept his mouth shut
cant say that for everybody can we
what are you saying
are you saying me
are you saying something about me
tell the truth eddie
its all you got left
shut up you little faggot
the cops made you give them somebody

eddie looks around
everybodys looking at him
he considers lying but realizes its pointless
all right so what
i mean so what man

next time you might trade us
turns to barbosa never felix never

hull observes barbosa become the power center

continuing okay a hundred
twenty four hours
felix i need time

but i can sadly then goodbye eddie
i forgive you for what you said to me
pleading twelve hours
to elias you want to do it david
elias looks stricken
eddie jumps up
hull turns away cant bear to watch this
grabs the first thing he lays eyes on a tiny snail fork and plunges it into barbosas neck
as if it were a fly bite barbosa flings the table aside and with a long knife already in his hand guts eddie from groin to breast bone
eddie falls like a suddenly emptied sack
elias cant help gasping
hull looks away hiding his horror
barbosa rips the fork out of his neck and hurls it at the body
piece of shit
elias stares at eddies body transfixed
horrified fascinated afraid in awe
barbosa turns to hull
continuing whatd you think
at least it was clean
pleased to elias what about you bar mitzvah body
first time you saw somebody die
eyes fixed on the body no
catching breath at camp
when i was fourteen
a friend of mine was water skiing
the motorboat ran him over
a junior counsellor was driving
you should kill a man some day david its liberating
walking out summer camp
im in business with somebody who went to summer camp
everyone else is silent grave
through sliders we see a small pool
elias and hull sit over uneaten omelets
both still shaken by the previous scene
he was always nice to my daughter
howd a guy like you get into this
the way most drug lawyers do clients paid me in product and i had to move it
soon i was doing more dealing than law
but this was there was so much money we thought it would never end
the road gets rougher
cocaines a dying business
then what are we doing here
people are always going to want to get high
every society has ways to alter consciousness
because they cant bear reality
smiles we all need our delusions only the means change psychedelics opiates prayer orgies human sacrifice
elias puts a finger to his lips
continuing why arent you selling it
i know how to make it and market it
but i need capital
thats the only reason im hanging out with an asshole like barbosa
feels his hatred of barbosa and because i cant get to the big guys
who are the big guys
gallegos et cetera
reacts to the name why cant you get to them
what do you care
hull shrugs he doesnt
continuing anyway designer drugs have a bad name ice ecstasy tar theres a limited market for parkinsons disease
but what about completely safe almost legal terrific shit you can go to work on and do your job better than you ever did it straight
sounds like a dream
they hear someone coming
closing the subject in dreams begin responsibilities
tell me about this new shit
some other time john when we know each other better
as miranda enters kitchen hey bunnela
she snuggles against him elias enjoys it five times two
its too early
dont bother me
he hugs her kisses her much more openly affectionate than hull was with his own children
hull notices that
continuing head in her fathers chest seven
elias whispers in her ear
continuing oh yeah
thats my friend john
this is miranda
miranda gives hull a shy greeting
nancy hurries into the kitchen handsome busy ready for work
come on honey
nancy this is john
nancy nods briefly in hulls direction
elias kisses miranda who grabs the back pack her mother proffers and they go out
when theyre gone continuing on nancys chilliness thats not about you
judgmental about what i do
when theyre gone he opens louvered doors onto a washer dryer takes a sports bag off a shelf gives it to hull
hull looks inside
he hefts the bag
thats more than i bought
half we owe you
the other halfs on consignment
a token of our esteem
youre having trouble moving it
elias doesnt deny it
continuing make me your partner
ill help you get your capital
i dont need a partner
i need a salesman
now in daylight
two separately wrapped kilograms of crack cocaine on the green blotter
i cant buy this much shit
i havent got it in the budget
what am i supposed to do with it
youre a drug dealer john
hull just looks at him
carver doesnt blink
you know how this goes gerry
it wont stop here
you know what theyre going to ask me to do pretty soon to prove im down
what am i supposed to do then
dont blow your carver
hull a moment of horror as he realizes what carver is saying
hes filling glass vials with crack
hundreds of them
its tedious work
he spills some curses
he cant believe hes doing this
he goes on doing it
youre still thinking like a cop john
cross the line
be what you are
youre a criminal
you dont give a shit about other people
youre just trying to survive
hull doling out vials to dealers seen earlier with eddie
i cant do this shit
i just cant
dealers going up to cars as before only now theyre hulls dealers
a well dressed black businessman buys from his bmw
but you want to be of use
you want to get drugs off the street dont you
thats why im here
another sale teenagers on foot
well this is the cost
pay it or go grow flowers someplace
he comes out of the motel talking to a dealer weve seen above
you cant back down with them
youve got to project strength from inside you know
the dealer nods
across the street hull sees a blue sedan
taft and hernandez
taft gives hull a little nod and grin
hull sitting in an aging trans am making entries in a notebook
across the street he watches a pregnant woman a squawling baby in arms buying from one of his dealers
he kicks the dash in frustrated anger
under the music cocksucker
as soon as the womans gone
he goes over to the dealer slaps his head slaps it again
under the music hurt confused whatd you do that for
walking off cause i can motherfucker cause i can
a white housewife making a buy from a new mini van a baby in the car seat
two usc football players letter jackets huge hassling bijoux a woman dealer pushing her she pushes back curses
suddenly hull comes running up shoves them apart
hes yelling pointing a finger in their faces
elias comes up behind calmer
hull is smaller than either usc kid but they back down as he curses them
under music touch her again motherfuckers im gonna mess you up
a brief scuffle
hull decks one usc and elias pulls him off
the kids leave
elias doubles over with laughter
hull yells at bijoux and walks off
hull looking at written address knocks on a door
its opened by a beautiful dark skinned black woman in a skimpy robe
she looks at him with disarming frankness
he thinks he must be in the wrong place
is david elias here
through the door we see him emerge from a bedroom stepping into his loafers buttoning his shirt
he gives the woman along dark kiss caressing her body
jacqueline ho ney
she laughs closes the door
as he and hull walk to the street elias sings happily to himself continuing whos making love to your old lady
while youre out make love
cheerful how come i like balling black chicks so much
cause youre a racist asshole
you feel like youre fucking a slave and it gets you off
oh dont mau mau me with the malcolm x shit
tell me youre not chasin white pussy every chance you get
i dont dig white women
knowing thats a lie even if i did it wouldnt mean the same thing
sure itd be the slave fucking the master
hegel talks about it
just like me but the other way around
who the fuck is hegel
some smart ass kike that talks backwards
elias laughs gets into hulls car
hulls angry takes a beat before he gets in
everybody digs the other john
they dig their own and they dig the other
does your wife dig black guys david
did she fuck eddie
does she want to fuck me
mock terrified ooo
you mean with that great big purple dick of yours
i hope not
shed never be impressed with my little thing again
you think what impresses her now is your dick
musing what does impress her
hull cant help laughing
he starts the car
elias and hull approach
hulls carrying a satchel and wearing a new leather jacket
as they go in elias switches the open sign to closed and turns the latch
the store is filled with latin american folk art particularly masks which line the walls
betty stone the woman hull saw with elias at the bar comes out from the back
she is a bad girl trying to dress the way she thinks a banker who went to vassar dresses for success
shes also a little strung out
she and hull recognize each other at once a brief reprise of that moment of perfect chemistry but she avoids his gaze
betty this is john my new associate
your new eddie
i hear the old one wore out
johns going to be a good customer
he does a lot of wash
hull puts the satchel on a display case
betty still wont look at him opens the satchel begins a quick count
she does this with a speed and sureness that suggests high test scores
so hows this place work
betty doesnt answer so elias covers the awkwardness
betty wires the money to a store in aruba in payment for things they never sent her
they deposit the money in a bank there that turns around and loans her money she never has to repay
that way it doesnt turn up as income for the irs
welcome to the laundromat
david you talk too much
she doesnt trust you
hull has taken down a mask puts it over his face looks in a mirror
how much is this
more than you can afford
ill take it
she produces a vial of coke looks questioningly at elias
by all means
she draws out six lines
elias does two
offering him the straw come on eddie
note betty is acutely attuned to hull and in his refusal she senses albeit unconsciously two things first that he doesnt trust himself on drugs therefore hes a dangerous guy
and therefore exciting and second more important the refusal bespeaks a repudiation of the violence and danger and thus a longing for goodness
despite the seeming contradiction she finds this even more attractive
but because she feels herself to be bad his goodness seems only a judgment against her and so she thinks she hates him
who is he my mother
smiles never have never will
betty ignores him does her lines
taunting hull oooh
cocaine i love it and i hate it and i love it
the disease is the cure
she cant help looking at hull whos looking at her
she and elias are stoned hes not
continuing dont look at me
elias tell him not to look at me
i dont like the fucker
but elias is too busy vacuuming up hulls leftovers
sniffling johns an ascetic negro he wants to make sure you know hes not a jungle bunny
watch your mouth david
but hes got another side
you should seen him on the street the other day with these two usc kids
do the spade bit for her john
black accent im gonna mess you up muthafugga
he sticks his finger in hulls face just like hull with the boys
dont call me a spade
and dont tell me to play black
he says it gently but betty hears the edge
hurt disappointed come on john you do it so well
falling into it ah aint playin muthafucka
ah aint playin
hull glares elias refuses to be intimidated
continuing dont fuckin dis me muthafucka
fuck b hive
fucka fucka fucka
elias dances around repeating fucka until its almost musical
hull picks him up and slams into a wall
say it again and ill kill you
elias throws hull back against a display case
hes strong and unafraid
theyre ready to fight
grow up assholes
this half snaps them out of it
still glowering they slowly relax release each other
hull sits in the trans am eating a sandwich and watching the street as a dealer leans in the window telling his sob story
theres an authority to hulls manner that tells us he may not like this job but he knows how to do it
the guy ripped me off man so i dont got the money i dont got the stuff and eyes on street you gotta pay anyway
oh but man
as he raps on comical pathos hull spots in his side mirror
coming slowly this way
ivy in the passenger window the barrel of an automatic weapon glinting in the streetlight
hull glances up bijoux is selling on the next corner
the range rover passes the trans am
ivy leans out
hull flings open the trans am door throwing the dealer to the ground
he jumps from the car continuing bijoux
she puts out her hands to block the shots
the sound of the gun is inaudible
the barrel bounces slightly
bijoux sprawls backward
bijoux dead on the sidewalk limbs askew bleeding from many wounds
hull standing over her covers her face
the body has been taken away the crowd has cleared
elias sits on the hood of the trans am
hull stands staring down
it wasnt your fault
no response what could you have done
she worked for me
im supposed to protect her
elias knows thats true and it leads to another truth
we have to kill him
hull looks up
continuing or we lose all authority with the other dealers
and one of themll kill you
hull looks up startled
continuing youve got to assert now or youre dead
hull sees the truth of that and slowly nods
continuing and if we kill ivy we control this whole territory
that guy who works for barbosa can do it chino
if we use chino its barbosa whos asserting
itll be barbosas territory
again his hatred of barbosa its gotta be us
and if its us its gotta be you
meaning he cant do it
hull knows that
a long beat on hulls face as he reaches the inevitable decision
to himself dont blow your cover
if i do this were partners
equal partners on everything
elias offers his hand
hull stands up a sudden resolve
continuing lets go
but hull is already moving
hull and elias driving looking for ivy
elias double parks by two prostitutes
we stay in the car with hull whos silent frightened keeps trying to warm his hands
outside elias is talking and laughing with the prostitutes
we see them point
he gives them money kisses
he gets back in the car
the range rover parked in front
eliass car stops
music pounds from inside
then one continuous shot they pass the club other store fronts
turn at the corner
turn into an alley
down the alley past the same buildings
the rear door of the club
to the next street
onto the original street back to the front of the club
they stop again
go wait around back
they look at each other
i want to see you in that alley
hulls so terrified he seems calm
with an air of submitting himself to fate he gets out and walks into the club
crowded and booming and strobe lit
hull pays the cover and climbs a staircase to a
that overlooks the dance floor
on stage a rap act with its throbbing beat and below hull a sea of dancers
hull circles the balcony
it isnt hard to pick out ivy hes all in red dancing with the woman we saw him with in the range rover the first time
hull reaches the steps again and starts down keeping his eye on ivy
the number ends
in the pause before the next one ivy can be seen excusing himself heading toward the rear of the club
the next number begins
hull pushes his way through the dancers to
leading toward the rear door they saw from the alley
a womans room
a mens room
hull goes into
ivy is pissing into a urinal
hes so huge he seems to take up all the space in the tiny room
hull stares at him unable to look away
he notices hull
all dialogue is under the pounding music
whatre you looking at
hull stares at ivys face
ivy considers this rude
continuing you want to suck it bitch
offers his dick or drink it
laughing he turns urinates on hulls pants
hull doesnt move
continuing recognizing him oh i know you
youre the bitch whose whore i wasted tonight aint you
somebody pushes on the outside of the door
hull holds it closed with his back
continuing i gotta take care of you too huh
he reaches into his pants for the butt of a gun
hull is frozen
ivy starts to draw it out
hull steps forward grabs ivys gun arm
with his other hand he clumsily pulls a silenced
from inside his jacket puts it in the underside of ivys jaw and shoots twice
ivys brains spray upward onto the wall and he slides straight to the floor
hull steps out into
an hispanic busboy coming out of the kitchen sees him and the gun in his hand freezes
hull walks past him and out the back door
from inside we see hull go down three steps stumble in the drive and fall to his knees the gun clattering away from him
a couple that had been making out stops looks
it takes hull a moment to gather himself
he picks up the gun gets into eliass car
it drives away
alone he looks at his face in the mirror
as if he doesnt know the person there
with a knife he draws out something hidden inside the wooden backing of the mirror
a manila envelope
he empties it onto the dresser mementos among which we see carefully preserved the blood soaked bills his father gave him
hull ignores them and picks up
he smooths out the folds stares at it as if trying to fix this in his thoughts
hull on the phone
hes unusually excited even moved
carmen its me
carmen on the phone jumping up and down with excitement
through phone hi baby
how are you
i miss you
i miss you
thrilled i miss you too daddy
hull pressing the phone to his face trying to master his emotions
a lab rat with a metal electrode protruding from its head is running a maze at high speed
a voice explaining things
young nasal too smart the maze leads in two directions
at one end the rat can obtain a food pellet
at the other
pointer indicates each end it receives electrical stimulus to a very specific area of the cerebellum
the rat reaches this second destination pushes a bar is stimulated
a lab worker white coat gloves picks up the animal replaces it at the start
it runs the same route
continuing this rat like of the others in the experiment chose the electrical stimulus repeatedly and exclusively
it continued to do so until it died of malnutrition
another shot the rat dead
a year old renegade from the cal tech chemistry department red hair freckles glasses held together with electrical tape a brilliant nerd
he picks up
colored balls stuck together with wooden dowels
this is an addictive amphetamine with time space distortion delusions of grandeur or maybe theyre real tending to be impulsive sometimes violent behavior
psychotropic adaptation for late monopoly capitalism
its illegal and you can buy it on any street corner
he tears off some of the balls sticks on new ones
continuing this increases energy attention cognitive powers yet with a smooth almost opiate like emotional surface
ideal for the post political post rationalist global marketplace and hour lifestyles
its completely legal and can only get it here in my lab
to hull proudly randys a genius
his professor told him he could win the nobel prize
nobel prizes are for wussies
what does this shit do to you
im on it now
its like cocaine only better
offers him powder on a slide want some
i dont take drugs
unoffended your mistake
this is designed for the top end of the market
for people who want to master reality not avoid it
because its synthetic you dont grow it refine it or best of all import it
what would it take to manufacture this stuff in quantity
with a million dollars i could produce enough for a limited market at about two bucks a pop
makes a face fair but then with five million or better yet ten the cost would drop to thirty cents and wed have enough for the whole world
im going to put two hundred fifty thousand into your corporate account
you cheat me randy ill use your bladder for a bagpipe
to hull with a vengeance were going to put barbosa out of business
elias is very happy
he leads hull out
on the pyramid chart theres a black border around ivys photo as around eddies
a photo of hull is now on the board beside the one of elias
hull stares out the window lost in thought
dismissive synthetic shit
sounds like a segment
hull shrugs its not that important
carver turns to his real interest
continuing so what was it like
still looking out what was what like
im god remember
looks back out then you should know how it was
carver smiles but hes non plussed by hulls new detachment
you didnt clear it with me
youre getting independent
continuing howre we coming on gallegos
he supplies barbosa
to get to him well have to take quantity
then youve got to thats what killing ivy did
ill get to him soon
continuing is that it
seeing him to the door i want you to get a new apartment
i like where i am
youre big time now
and get some clothes
thats an order
hull in a new expensive suit gives the big blonde woman cash
whether im here or not no one else uses that room
and change the linen twice a week just like now
starts to go stops more money and make sure james gets what he needs
and something for you
he adds another bill
views open space expensive furnishings
hull in another fancy suit is hanging a couple of bettys masks
hes meticulous about their placement
elias wanders out from the other rooms looking around
impressed envious nice place
hull has a moment of self consciousness about the suit checks himself out in a mirror a private moment
elias flops on a couch puts his feet on an antique coffee table
he hurries over lifts elias feet to the floor
hull brushes the wood inspects it carefully fusses worries
elias is amused
you pick all this shit out yourself
a jewish lady in the store helped me
mock touched by racial harmony aw
hull starts to place stacks of cash in a briefcase
hes momentarily mesmerized by all the money
to himself fifty bucks fifty fucking bucks
you sold it all
continuing ill order a couple more keys from barbosa
afraid of that i dont want to push it
weve got a bigger territory we need more product
i want to deal directly with gallegos
it would save us money
barbosall never let us near him
hull closes the briefcase ushers elias toward the door
hes going out too
if we buy twenty gallegosll come to us himself
how do you know
when i bought a key from eddie you came to me
elias laughs surprised afraid
continuing whos above gallegos
guzman but hes
dont ask so many questions
how else will i learn
hint of a threat call barbosa david put in our order
because we have to split this and there isnt enough here for both of us
elias feels the threat
despite the closed sign a lights on inside
he keeps knocking without let up until annoyed nobodys home go away
he knocks harder
finally she appears in the doorway stopping short when she sees its him
shes immediately aware of white streaks on her grey suit
she tries to brush them off
doesnt want to let him in look im tired why dont you
hull holds up the briefcase
she sighs unlocks the door
a bill counter toting up the cash
she watches it fixedly to avoid looking at him but she feels the chemistry
why do you look at me like that
how do i look at you
like you know something i dont
like youre better than me
that catches hull off guard and he responds with a candor she didnt expect
i dont think im better than you
i dont think im better than anybody
shes startled by this remark and instinctively drawn to him
continuing but i do know something
you cant stop thinking about me
embarrassed she looks away
he takes her hand and at his touch something yields to her
she lets him draw her to him
his kiss is strangely tender searching
it turns betty on incredibly
she melts into him
lets go back here
she leads him into
shes sweet and loving but her sweetness scares her
hes all over her but she pulls back for a moment
there is a couch and before it a coffee table with coke scattered on a plate
indicates coke do this
do it with me
she offers him a straw
he doesnt take it
continuing this is where im at
you want to be with me its gotta be there
i dont do that
never have never will
its for fuck ups
what do you think youre not a nigger
youre a nigger as much as me
shes angry hurt confused wants to love him but feels he wont let her or she wont let herself
finally shes released by a knock on the door
she goes out to
lets in elias
he smells the tension
amused jealous having fun
neither answers to hull i talked to barbosa
hell see us now
hull turns to betty
both want to go that way instead of this but events are leading somewhere else
he follows elias out
music pouring into the darkness
kids dancing to a live stage act
high in a wall a lit window
very different from the club
a comfortable room with a bar tables filled with men much older than the dancers below
barbosa and gopher at the bar with elias and hull
chino and other shadowy figures lurk in the rooms depths
youre always late on two
continuing the more we have the more we can move
therere markets we cant open because we dont have the inventory
barbosas coked to the eyeballs mean and dangerous
finally some balls on this team
taunting elias come work for me john
ill give you your own franchise
you can supply elias lean on him when hes late
go fuck yourself
im with david
he give you his designer drugs pitch
hes never going to do it
hes a shmuck
dont talk to me that way
im not talking to you at all
im talking to john
its the cocaine
dont listen to him
felix youve had enough
elias goes for him
hes fast and strong and it takes chino and hull to pull him off
praise god they dont let guns in here
none of that in here
take it outside
barbosas laughing but his cheek is flecked with his own blood and his eyes are dead
david youve been working out youre getting strong
are you quick too
shadow boxes come on ill give you a shot at me
any time any place
right here right now
he puts his hands out palms up
what is this
you know you slap me i slap you
mimes that game come on its fun
like summer camp
it doesnt look fun
elias glances at hull for guidance
dont waste your time
stay out of this
to elias come on you can do it david youre not a shmuck
elias puts his hands out palms up
barbosa covers them with his own
on the hands barbosas broad muscular with thick gold rings and a rolex eliass paler slighter a wedding band and a slim watch
continuing slap my hands
just slap them
elias looks barbosa in the eye
hes trying to be a snake but hes more the mouse
he looks away and as he does tries to
slap him with both hands but hits only
the room breathes
barbosa turns his rings so the big surfaces point down
continuing now its my turn
its barbosas turn
hes gonna kill the white boy
no you went davey now its my turn
first to four wins like the world series
elias covers barbosas palms with his own
oh god i cant look
on the hands barbosa tenses his hands
elias yanks back
barbosas hands havent moved
you remember the rules
if you flinch i get to hit you
he slaps elias across the face
hull starts forward
a knife appears
continuing again shmuck
elias covers barbosas hands
elias holds firm and barbosa quickly slaps both hands hard
elias doubles over holding his hands in pain
that was two
no this is two
he slaps him again a stinging crack
elias looks to hull but theyre across a canyon
hull lowers his eyes
oh and it hurts
mercy it hurts
on the hands
barbosa moves his hands a millimeter and elias flinches again
barbosa smacks him across the face
the sound reverberates through the room
now even gopher is silent
tears run from eliass eyes blood from his mouth but he doesnt move
steps forward out of the shadows
he is young mid s handsome european features beautifully dressed accompanied by a guard well know as molto
someone murmurs to someone else gallegos
their eyes meet
the fight is over
the ambassador from the south has spoken
refusing any mercy one more
barbosa shakes his head ashamed now in front of gallegos
continuing one more
were not finished
people are silent four was the match
he holds out his hands
barbosa resumes the stance then waits waits waits and finally brings both hands down terribly hard the sound of the slap is awful
okay thats it
hull leads elias to the door right past gallegos
their gazes meet again
as they go out they hear gallegos berating barbosa in furious spanish
trembling elias holds his bloody hands against his chest as hull leads him in silence down the steps
look at me
look at me damn it
he barely whispers but its like a shout
hull whod been avoiding his gaze forces himself to look
eliass humiliation is so profound it almost ennobles him
finally why did you do it
i needed it
they taught me what i needed to know
that im not part of them and i never will be
that they dont respect me
that i dont deserve respect
because im a shmuck john
im a shmuck
he laughs a terrible laugh
the door behind them opens and barbosa appears with gopher
everyone is ready for death but david im sorry
its a crazy time and
im doing a little too much coca
ill buy your kid a pony
anything you want
lets forget about it
he comes down the stairs offers his hand
elias will never forget about it but he silently takes the hand holds them in his own bloody paws looking directly into barbosas face
barbosa becomes uneasy manages to extract his hand
elias and hull continue down and out the door
gopher gushes to barbosa
i am so proud of you
you can be cruel and you can be kind
and just now you were kind
proud proud and more proud
barbosa gopher with hernandez tafts partner
now we know hernandez is corrupt thats how they knew eddie was talking
i got nothing to give you my man

hernandez rubs thumb against fingers
when this is over ill send you to hawaii maui

i wouldnt trust that man when hes out of rifle range
barbosa looks tired
continuing premonition of disaster dont do this felix
itll go wrong

it damages your prestige
barbosa faces his cocaine
he tries to resist the pull then yields
he does another line
its his friend
he loves it
he picks up a cellular phone dials
david youre awake im impressed

hull jacked up excited pleased with himself
as he paces carver observes his beautiful suit shoes expensive watch
he looks much better than carver

hull likes that
continuing were getting the dope from him its still coming through barbosa but gallegos will approach me soon on his own

hull walks out
continuing john dont go near that bust
elias no sleep driving
betty in front
hull in back
we shouldnt go to them
maybe them come to us
they pull into the lot of a boarded up restaurant where barbosa and chino stand outside of a limousine
taft and hernandez in the same van that was outside the gym earlier
theyre watching through binoculars night scopes
they spot eliass car
whispering into radio here they are
nobody move until we see the green suitcase
the two groups meeting
barbosa gives betty a courtly kiss
flirtatious im sorry for dragging you out so late but i have to be careful
it gives me confidence
watching planes descend into the airport nervous
he knows whats coming but how does he handle it
lets see what weve got
elias takes a satchel out of the rent a car trunk
chino opens the limousines trunk
inside is an over sized day glo green plastic suitcase
he is about to pick it up
continuing spotting the police van in the adjacent lot dont touch it
everyone looks at him then the direction hes looking
what is this
whats that van doing there
they can barely see the van
hull pulls a gun
continuing this is a bust
the minute we take the stuff theyll be over us
hes crazy david
i thought you were the crazy one but its him
hull puts the gun to barbosas head addresses chino chino pick up the suitcase and give it to elias
ill only kill him if something goes wrong
chino moves to pick up the suitcase
everyone looks at hull amazed even chino
softly fucking a john
okay everybody in the car
he throws the money in the limo truck slams the lid
hes running the show now and everyone knows it
hes winging it but confident and strangely calm
elias energized by hulls command grabs barbosa and throws him toward the limo
we have a problem
aiming rifle hull in sights enough of this
hull shepherding everyone into the limo
he glances toward the van
he pulls chino to him
chinos head explodes
screaming at van dont shoot
taft hurling hernandez against the wall
goddam it what the hell are you doing
elias drags barbosa into the limo
hull throws betty into the front seat
the limo takes off
hull driving betty up front
elias with a gun on barbosa in back
hull slaloms the limo through police gunfire
windows are blown out
weeping i asked for this
i asked for it
its my fault
calm eyes on road relax
well make it
she looks at him stunned yet soothed by his certainty
hes a cop
he has to be
how else would he have known
if i was cop youd be face down back there
how did you know
the whole thing smelled
changing his mind about the stuff
meeting us way out here
and id seen cops in that van before
hernandez is dirty thats who hes using
to barbosa get out of the car
he starts to open the door
david not now
taft at wheel raging at hernandez
who are you man
who the fuck are you
stonewalling im me
he traded us to the cops
just like eddie
eddie who was nice to my daughter had to die because thats the rule
and you were vulgar about my wife felix so at the very least the same rule applies to you
ill give you money
ill give you a million
anything you want
i want you to get out of the car
get out of the fucking car
out of the fucking near tears no no
we cant do this
turning around from front seat stop it david or were
elias wheels on him sticks the gun in his face in a fury look at my hands
he holds them up swollen black and blue cut up
continuing to barbosa softly get out of the car
elias grabs his hand shoots a bullet through
elias wheels on them swinging the gun from one to the other
stay out of this or youll die
youll both die
his fury makes anything seem possible
he pushes open the door
trembling barbosa starts to climb out
the limo enters a tunnel police still in pursuit
halfway out barbosa stops
elias shoots him in the butt
he shrieks jerks forward
the cops are getting close behind
other cops waiting at the far end of the tunnel
hull hits the brakes spins a into the opposite lane
barbosa is flung out of the car and plastered by a succession of fishtailing vehicles
hull speeds back the other way
theyre going straight at taft and hull the two drivers lock eyes
its chicken but more than that
two men set against each other who for some reason want to be friends
at the last instant the van swerves away but taft sees the gun too late
he can do nothing
hulls gaze follows tafts
he sees elias deliberately swerves sending the shot wild
i had him
you want to kill a cop
dont be stupid
the limo speeds away
the windows shot out
hull and betty silent shaken
elias charged up happy
everything is different
were the colombians now
radiant this is the greatest night of my life
terrible but great
felix was right
appalled about what
he said i should kill a man
he was right
barbosa was a roach
do you miss him
will anybody in the world miss him
are you a roach too
to hull what about you
hes silent keeps driving
shes had enough
continuing stop the car
hull looks at her
continuing stop it
he brakes to a stop
she jumps out leans back in
continuing no more laundering no more anything
im finished with this
and she disappears into the night
elias watches her go
hull resumes driving
she knows too much
we have to kill her
shes with me
shes not going to talk
looks at elias you touch her ill kill you
shes your responsibility then
hull accepts it
continuing were going to get the money now john
enough for the new drug
were going to be rich
were going to be so rich that were going to leave the world of ordinary people and going to a higher realm
i mean that
theyre going to come after us
matter of fact its a hardball game
were hardball players
hernandez comes out of a bodega with groceries wine and a woman
he nuzzles her as he lets her into his car
as hes getting behind the wheel molto gallegos guard stops the door from closing
the conversation is entirely in spanish
it wasnt my fault
it never is
he shoots him in the head
hernandez slumps against the wheel
the woman screams
molto walks away
hull finds a door pushes the buzzer
betty looks through the glass
shes afraid of him
dont kill me
im not going to talk
then she looks closer and sees not murder in his face but need
she opens the door
without a word he gathers her to him
she cant resist him now
her mouth is everywhere on him
betty gasping in the wake of pleasure turning her face away from him she feels so exposed
she hides her face in his neck
they lie in each others arms relaxed together for the first time
a wonderful unprotected openness
softly tell me about you
half kidding everything worth knowing you just found you
they begin to make love again
suddenly an extra hand stroking bettys hair
a gun in hulls ear
another in her face
guns all around
dont hurt her
hands pull him out of bed leave her there alone
we see molto two or three others
ramon gallegos lays a bouquet of white lillies on a grave
he kneels whispers a prayer crosses himself
he rises and walks to where molto and the other guards hold hull and elias
gallegos is in his thirties more european than barbosa
he has a distinctly mild manner
an impudent question but elias seems strangely bright eyed despite the guns held on him
she died of leukemia three years ago
looks around i like to be among the dead
they never interrupt you
turning to them felix barbosa started out as a skinny fourteen year old fucking yankee businessman in bogata hotels
he grew up
he made himself strong and rich but getting there made him sick and that killed him
so he lost everything for the same reason hed gotten it in the first place
now well see if you can do as well
a priest going by greets gallegos who responds warmly
they chat a minute in spanish
the priest leaves
continuing felix owed me one million eight hundred thousand dollars
he addresses this to hull elias feels left out
continuing when you killed him you bought the debt now you owe it to me you get to keep thirty percent like he did
you have three days
gallegos turns to leave
who did barbosa collect from
if you dont know you shouldnt have killed him
he notices hulls earring two tiny dice the spots made of minuscule jewels
unembarrassed he fingers it
can i have that
without waiting for an answer he yanks it out of hulls ear and walks away leaving hull bleeding through his fingers before a stone cross
a club on the corner
through a window we see a rap act on the stage their music pumping out onto the street
hull pulls up in a jaguar
he and elias go through a door adjacent to the club
the music is still audible here though muffled
elias and hull are pushing at door gopher is trying to hold closed
i dont want you in here
you killed the man and i loved him
i dont want to have anything to do with you
elias kicks it open and they enter gophers tiny miserable domain
hes wearing some sort of negligee and an immense naked woman fills his bed
we still hear the muffled music
continuing apoplectic im a sixty three year old man
im a grandfather
would you hit a sixty three year old white man
would you hit your own grandfather
slaps him against wall listen you fucking monkey you know who owed him money and we know you know
tell us or hull pulls him off
elias is angry
hell tell us
meaning deal with me or deal with elias
you cant tell anyone it was me
the music continues over the following sequence elias arguing with a dealer
he slaps him around
money is exchanged
the money is stuffed in a satchel
a well dressed lawyer s talking with clients a distinguished couple in their s
the door bangs open and a secretary is unable to restrain hull and elias as they charge into the room
the lawyer is up on his feet but hull shoves him around as elias politely explains to the clients that this will only take a moment
hulls hands thrust more money in
its getting full
a biker in leathers on hands and knees spitting blood onto the cement floor
hull stands over him fists clenched
a satchel stuffed with money is latched set next to another latched one
a third is opened money and jewelry dumped in
hull looking into the trunk
elias is beat
where the hell is all the money
were still a million short
i gotta get laid
david weve got thirty six hours
slams trunk moves toward door pick me up at jacquelines in the morning
sooner than that
elias gets in the car and drives off
hull turns and a dark american sedan pulls up alongside
carver behind the wheel
an order get in
as he gets in what are you doing here
youre going to get me killed
carver peels away fast
hes very angry frightened too but thats hidden
where the hell have you been
doing my job
theres an indifference to carvers authority we havent heard before
hull isnt even aware of it but carver is
you violated a direct order to stay away from that bust
as a result a police informant is dead a state senator was critically injured in the tunnel pile up and a city policeman was subsequently murdered
i didnt blow my cover
dont get smart with me motherfucker
dont be a shmuck gerry
im talking to gallegos
im collecting his money
we can set him up right now
note carver arrives somewhere and parks
to be discussed but lets say for now that we are they get out of the car
carver takes out a flask has a drink offers it to hull who declines
never have never will
puts the flask away i want you to give me your gun
youre coming in right now
doesnt understand coming in where
your assignment has been terminated
youre not going out there again
if i have to ill put you in custody
uncomprehending im going to have gallegos in two days
carver says nothing
suddenly hull understands
continuing youre protecting him
youre protecting gallegos
carver snorts ridiculous
continuing no of course
thats why you wanted to bust elias and betty
i was getting close and you wanted to cut this off then
what is he the new noriega
helps you fight commies so you let him sell drugs to the niggers
two birds with one stone
you violated orders so youre through
dont make a conspiracy theory out of it
laughs im through
then i might as well have a drink after all
surprised carver reaches for the flask
as he does hull grabs him pushes him out over the edge of the building holds him there
continuing now tell me the truth or theyre going to decide your troubles got the best of you
hull pushes him out farther
all the more reason to do what i say
jesus ger im having trouble holding on
its the state department
hull pulls him back in
carver slumps against the wall drinks greedily
hull lets him for a moment then takes the flask away
continuing i told you gallegoss uncle is a big deal down there
our government supports guzman because hes a moderate
thats a right winger whos pro u
he doesnt like it either if gallegos got busted here it would hurt guzmans political career there
its politics john not drugs
drugs is politics
politics is drugs
sickened christ gerry i dealt drugs
i killed a man
what did i do all this for
im going to washington john
ill bring you with me
well have clout money
outraged i didnt do this for clout or money
you said we were gonna do some good
tryings for college boys
his head on fire if all there is is power and money
if all there is
then what am i doing here
cause i can get more power and money out on the street i got more there already than id ever get kissing your ass in washington
but you cant do that john
its not you
there is no me
we took care of that
first i was a cop pretending to be a dealer
now im just a dealer pretending to be a cop
why not stop pretending
quit the force
be a dealer
its not that simple
my assignments already terminated
all i have to do is quit
i hereby quit
lifts the flask my first one
drinks not so bad
he slips the flask in his pocket gets in the car starts engine
dont blow your cover
hull drives off leaving carver alone on the roof
she lets him in sees the distress in his face
whats the matter
he shakes his head drops onto the couch
he takes out the flask offers it to her
she shakes her head
who are you my mother
he laughs takes a drink
shes surprised says nothing
tell you what
what you came to say
what did i come to say
then tell me anything
something about you
long beat another drink when i was young i occasionally stole things
laughs to himself my father died when i was ten
right in front of me
the revelation is so sudden it surprises hull as much as betty
continuing heart attack
he just fell down
he said i love you then died in my arms
she holds him and he lets himself be held
continuing tell me whats going on john
doesnt want to talk about that youre not doing the stuff anymore are you
pulls playfully at her nose
dont change the subject
how is that
trying to tell without telling things are getting theyre getting a little
i had certain plans and people havent come through exactly as they promised
what do you expect with those people
laughs its not just those people
its bigger than that
its of everybody
present company excluded
youve got to stop this john you know that
you gotta get out
of course you can
almost angry no
this is what im supposed to do
who said youre supposed to
the whole fuckin world
you think i didnt try something else
but everything funnels you right back here
like its where you had to go all along
but you know what youre doing dont you selling this stuff
doing to our own
if i tried to get out now theyd kill me
tortured i cant be with somebodys who involved in drugs
hes even happy about it
but she wont yield
finally he gets up and walks back out the door
the neighborhood is reminiscent of the one where joe stevens sr
the rap club still pumps music onto the a
streets where whores junkies children teenagers with beepers and nikes welfare mothers roam as if it were daytime anywhere else
their eyes yearning sullen vital hopeless and hoping stare at
everyone knows what he is the black man with the big car
they dont remember when he was just another hustler making street buys
now they hate him revere him want to be him not caring what it entails
every eye follows as
he and elias cross the street toward gophers door
hulls eyes dont go right or left
hes a driven man now
gopher has just been roused from sleep
a light in his face hull and elias looming over him
thereve got to be more
we have a million two we owe gallegos one eight
i told you everyone
everyone who owed him everyone he
barbosa barely owed him a million
hull and elias look at each other
taft is showing her photocopies of phone bills bank transactions invoices
shes obviously upset
i got every money transfer every phone call all your laundry tickets
miserable what do you want
or youll go away til youre a dried up old woman and when you come out aint nobody gonna want you
she covers her face
elias driving a car we havent seen before and snickering to himself at some private joke
what are you laughing at
elias shakes his head nothing
they pull into the lot beside a movie theater
a technicolor spanish melodrama is winding to its lurid end
a door in back opens and a burst of daylight reveals hull and elias being brought in by a guard and met by molto
molto and the guard frisk them take their guns and money satchels make them wait a moment until
the movie ends
the house lights come on revealing ramon gallegos as the only spectator in the theater
molto and the guard bring hull and elias down the aisle to him
gallegos looking in the satchels
a tense moment
it isnt one eight
off gallegos its a million one
thats all barbosa owed its all were paying
gallegos is stern for a moment then laughs
big brass balls
collecting money makes you strong
gallegos scribbles something on a piece of paper hands it to the guard who feeds it into a fax machine
im telling our suppliers they got paid
theyll be very happy
and were happy
its a happy world
elias seems a bit mad but no one minds
he and hull are ready to go
he gestures to molto wants his gun back
so how can i express my gratitude for a job well done
we want barbosas business
gallegos gestures to molto to give them the guns
and also your business
your money your dope everything
hull looks at elias whats going on
smiles youre tougher than i thought but not that tough
how tough is enough
he brings up the gun and shoots gallegos in the head
hull and the guards are frozen
then everyone goes for a gun
elias shoots the guard
hull has his gun to moltos head and screams at elias no
meaning dont shoot him
but elias has no intention of doing so
breathless thank you john
i couldnt have done that without you
barely able to speak jesus christ
he cant believe it the guy hes been after the whole time is dead on the floor
you taught me to take my work seriously
whats going on here david
were taking over
youre doing too much stuff
no im very clear
im very very clear
to molto ahora usted nos assistamos
hull elias and molto getting into their car
molto is recalcitrant
elias pistol whips him
hull stops him
the car passes through a development of suburban homes
they enter a driveway
two boys play in the yard
to molto donde esta
molto is silent
elias fires a bullet right between his feet
the boys turn
hull grabs the gun away
we feel the toll eliass madness is taking on him
what the fucks the matter with you
it works john
and indeed molto is pointing to a winnebago parked at the rear of the property
with a tire iron hull snaps off the padlock that holds the rear door closed
he opens the door
money gushes out
he slams it closed
he elias and molto are on hands and knees scooping it up
molto tied to a tree
elias is giving him instructions while strangely removing moltos shoes and socks
to molto disce a senor guzman que
his spanish isnt good enough that we have his money and were willing to talk as soon as he comes to town
well know how to reach him
molto just glares at him
elias smiles takes the shoes and socks and all the contents of moltos into the winnebago and he and hull drive away leaving the car behind
the winnebago enters the garage elias greeting the attendant hey frank
frank waves him in
the garage is filled with various rvs
hull pulls the winnebago into an empty spot beside eliass car and gets out
elias remains in the cabin making calculations
approximating the cubic capacity and depending on the denominations of the bills its somewhere between fifty million and two hundred million dollars
right back there
as he does hull checks his gun walks around behind the vehicle and prepares to shoot elias in the back of the head through the open window
elias finishes his money report and sits there as if unaware of hull but continuing not turning around think im crazy
blowing up gun still on him i cant believe you got us into this
all of fucking latin america is going to be after our asses including renaldo guzman whos friends with fucking george bush
i know theyre coming after us
i want them to
well give them the money but well make a deal for ourselves
well get what we need for the synthetic drugs
ive thought it all out
ive been thinking it out for years
hull uncocks the gun rubs it against his burning face
elias turns around embraces him
continuing were going to have everything
dont you want everything john
theyre going to get your family david
theyll kill your wife and daughter
serene nancy and miranda left the country two days ago
you knew about this then
continuing what about betty
a car squeals to a stop
molto and three thugs smash through the glass door
they disappear into the store where things can be heard breaking
they emerge a moment later jump into the car
hulls car races up
he jumps out dashes toward the building
forty people on folding chairs
hull enters on a dead run
he stops short when he sees at the front
he signals to her but shes already saying hi my name is betty
my name is betty im a drug addict
and ive been clean for nineteen days
the room bursts into applause
she sees hull at the back he signals to her but she goes on
continuing ive been using drugs and selling them and ive wanted to stop for a long time and the only way i did was because i met a man i
loved and who loved me
i know thats not what im supposed to say
im supposed to say there was a higher power and maybe there was behind it all but this man is strong and his love made me strong enough that i
could start or at least think about a life that didnt have drugs in it
shes looking right at hull as she speaks
hes torn between the danger he knows shes in and his emotion at what shes saying
hull hurrying betty toward his car
ive got to get clothes
you cant go back
molto and men pouring through it
in frustration molto smashes the table hull had fussed over when elias put his feet up
hull and betty hurry toward his room carrying shopping bags a newly bought suitcase
they freeze turn ready to bolt
but more cops behind them
a panic yet no ones coming after them
they walk on
the cops are going into and coming out of belindas room
the fat blonde woman is talking to a policewoman
james sits on the bed staring at
who lies dead on a floor littered with crack vials
hull picks up a vial holds it up to the blonde woman with a question
nodding she got a fever and just burned up
she just burned up all of a sudden
it must have been bad stuff
indicating james he shouldnt be here
takes his hand come on james well go get a burrito
the boy allows himself to be led out
betty looks at hull whos in a private hell
hull and betty are about to enter hulls room
the door is ajar
taft stands at the dresser
hes found hulls collection of memorabilia and is looking at the photo of his children
angry at the invasion give me that
he snatches away the photo but not before betty sees it
she reaches out her hand
he reluctantly turns it over to her
tell me something who the fuck are you
hull doesnt answer collects the rest of his things including the bloody money stuffs it back in the envelope
continuing cause i dont think youre quite the asshole youre trying to be
taft thats your name right
leave me alone
i got things on my mind
id think you would
you better have your goddamn life on your mind or its gonna get away from you
its gonna burn up like that poor woman across the way
like all of yous gonna burn
and what do you do mr
taft except chase bad guys up and down the street with your dirty partner never catching anybody important
i do what i can
do you do what you can
hull says nothing maybe my partner was dirty
maybe the chiefs dirty
and the mayor
and the president
maybe god himselfs taking something on the side
thats their problem
but ill bust em if i can
without force get out of my room
dont deny who you are
hull turns to betty who is still holding the photo of his children
he gently takes it looks at it seems to draw both succor and pain from it
he gets out carvers flask and tries to drink but its empty
theyre my children
they live in cleveland with their mother
im divorced from her
i havent seen them in
i want to but i havent been able to arrange it
how much else dont i know about you
trying to make a joke everything else
everything else is
i dont know
taft has all the evidence about my laundering
hes going to put me in jail for a long time unless i give you up
so ive got to get away
but i need money
i got money
he empties his pockets of all that gushed out of the winnebago empties a satchel as well until it fills the room like snow
hull putting betty into an airport limousine
to the driver international terminal
to betty ill meet you there in a week
she kisses him
hes about to close the door
she stops it
you know the first time when i saw you in the bar
smiles at the memory you wouldnt even look at me
cause i knew what you were thinking
you were judging me
no i wasnt i was
your eyes were like an angel in my heart telling me i should be good and i didnt want to hear it
this news startles hull yet strangely he senses its truth and the sweetness is more than he can bear
continuing thats you too
maybe this is you i dont know but i know thats you
she closes the door
the car pulls away
in an unmarked car up the street taft picks up the radio
a limousine pulls into the gate and disgorges renaldo guzman and his wife
theyre shown into the consulate
the limousine pulls out onto the street and parks
gopher appears knocks on the drivers window
it comes down
they chat briefly in spanish
gopher opens up a cellular phone
overlooking the ocean
hull pacing nervously elias relaxed reading the paper
what if we forget all this
take ten million each and disappear
leave the country
new identities new lives
whats the matter john
a phone rings
elias picks up his own cellular
we pick the time and place
otherwise no meet
looks to hull who nods his agreement got a pencil
gopher hands a piece of paper to the limo driver
he walks away
as hes about to get into a car taft grabs him
gopher is surprised and not pleased
where hull and elias left the winnebago
guzmans limo approaches
frank the attendant waves it on
the limo climbs the ramps until it comes to eliass car parked where the winnebago was the winnie is nowhere in sight
the limo pulls alongside
hull and elias get out
molto gets out of the limo
then renaldo guzman
we have a proposal to make
we regret what happened to your nephew
say what you have to say
we all know that your cousins business is coming to an end
costs have climbed while profits and the market guzman waves get to the point
continuing we have developed a new product simpler cheaper to manufacture superior quality and completely synthetic
therefore no growing no refining no peasants no importing no customs agents
heres a detailed prospectus with anticipated cash flow and so forth
he hands a copy to guzman and the lawyer
to molto teasing elias the racist americans just want to cut us poor hispanics out of the market
there are no americans anymore mr
guzman you know that
no hispanics no japanese no blacks no whites no anything
there are only rich people and poor people
were rich so were on the same side
taft with gopher in his car
do they have money in there
i dont know
they wouldnt meet here otherwise
gopher shrugs a decision taft picks up his radio
continuing okay everybody heres the play
were prepared to give you of the money
the remainder you invest in our business with proceeds paid out according to the figures there
he indicates the prospectus that guzman has been looking through
this looks interesting
id have to confirm everything of course
do you have a sample of the product
elias produces one
guzman gestures to molto
molto samples it
moltos eyes widen
where is our money
elias hands him a key points to a different winnebago
molto takes the key unlocks the back money
he signals okay to guzman
police cars wail into the garage
the thwack thwack and sweeping light of a helicopter descend toward the roof though we never see the copter
continuing anger you set this up
theyre after us not you
the garage is a labyrinth of cement stairwells ramps hundreds of rvs to hide between under and so forth
lots of noise lights but mostly we see hull and elias dodging here avoiding the action
molto caught between the lights
he draws his gun
hes cut down
screaming where are the rest of them
cars with rotating dome lights but not many cops
hull and elias emerge from a shadowy doorway and make their way at a casual pace beyond the perimeter of police cars quickly mingling with other spectators
they continue down
elias elated uncontained joy
we did it
twenty fucking million
were going to have synthetics
were gonna be rich
hull stops walking and just stands there
continuing whats the matter john
your whole life has just been solved
behind them stop
in one motion elias draws his gun turns and fires
the figure goes down
elias cant believe he hit him
hull starts toward the figure
heading the other way john where are you going
taft on the ground
oh jesus no
he drops to his knees
blood oozes from tafts chest
john what the hell are you doing
lets get out of here
hull tries to hold closed the wound
the posture duplicates hull with his dying father
he feels for a pulse
distraught hes dying
let him die
let him die twice
he pulls at hull who wont go
hull does mouth to mouth
taft opens his eyes looks up at him
says to taft whatever a cpr trained policeman would say in this situation
to elias get help
are you kidding me
to hull getting it oh man youre a cop
youre a cop arent you
with difficulty as if against his will yeah im a cop
im a fucking cop
laughs oh really
wheres you badge
i dont have one
get help david
john thats a cop
he tried to kill you
he didnt know
oh he didnt know
i dont know
maybe you dont know
maybe you think youre a cop because
drop the gun put your hands against the car
spread your legs
taft grunts once stiffens
continuing my god
the pulse is gone
hull begins to perform cpr
okay lets say youre a cop
be a cop
hull keeps doing cpr
continuing weve still got the money
we put it into randys chemistry set
in five years were worth five hundred million each minimum
youll be one of the richest black men in america
richer than cosby
who gives a shit how you got it
you think the white ones were honest
hull keeps working on taft
continuing is this asshole all that stands between you and greatness
let me do you a favor
he puts a gun to tafts head and fires
in a reflex hull draws his own gun shoots elias in the stomach
stunned he wobbles backward a few steps
sits on the street
continuing gee john thats kind of an extreme reaction
hull is stunned he did it
and this finally attracts the police who see a black man with a gun who just shot a white man
hull goes to elias whos dead
a policeman pulls him off beating him with a gun
hull bandaged wearing prison blues walking with carver
what about guzman
he vanished thank god or wed both be in deep doo doo
at least you got gallegos
and everything goes on as before
thats the drug game
plus a change
i want you to come back to work for me
youll beat all charges on a technicality and go back to who you were
who was i ger
does anyone really know
i have other things to do
hull looks at him how did he know
continuing im god remember
he beckons him
he walks him over to a cell
through a one way window they see alone in the cell unaware shes being watched
go back to work she walks out of here
otherwise shes up on multiple counts and ill see to it the judge runs them consecutively
hull just looks at him
carver shrugs apologetically
not a window not a stick of furniture
the only deviation is hull in prison blues
the door opens betty comes in wearing prison yellows
she sits on a nearly invisible chair
they know theyre being watched
they want me to testify against you
i said i wouldnt
you have to
its all set up
thats how youre getting off
she shakes her head in cynical understanding
how difficult it is to get back to an honorable life
he takes her hand
continuing with difficulty my father didnt have a heart attack
she looks at him
continuing he was shot robbing a liquor store
trying to rob it
i lied about that
baby why are you telling me this
i had to start somewhere
therere other things you dont know
beginning to make love
hull extracts himself gives the finger to the pov and stuffs a bit of tissue in the iris blocking our view
carver takes his eye from the now obscured peephole
tafts wife and children from the wallet photo leave the graveside with the rest of the funeral party
when everyone is gone hull approaches the grave
from his pocket he removes the four blood soaked bills his father gave him and wedges these among the stems of flowers that already cover the plot
hes silent a moment then he gets up
he joins carver whos standing with hulls children
the kids each take his hand they walk together
betty walked out of court free this morning
thats my side of the deal
to the children you two run on ahead
hull watches them go
her probation gets revoked the minute you fuck up
i want you to stay away from her altogether
you know the difference between a black man and a nigger
carver smiles shakes his head
he likes a good joke
hull punches him so hard in the stomach that he goes to his knees
continuing the niggers the one whod even think about doing what you tell him
he walks away
still on his knees doubled over carver whispers after him dont blow your cover
