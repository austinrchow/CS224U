written by andrew niccol close up on the face of yuri orlov
late thirties maybe the wrong side of forty cigarette dangling from his fingers wearing a conservative suit and tie
black smoke wafts in front of his face
he speaks matter of factly directly into camera
there are over million firearms in worldwide circulation
thats one firearm for every twelve people on the planet
the only question is
taking a draft and stubbing out the cigarette how do we arm the other eleven
the camera zooms away from his face revealing yuri alone on a battlefield surrounded by the charred carcasses of armored military vehicles and other equipment discarded weapons and ammunition desert
floor stained with what appears to be blood
the faint sound of gunfire some distance away carries to us on the wind
gunpowder is poured into a metal casing lead slug mounted on top
a bullet is born
a perfect mm
the bullet travels along a conveyor belt with thousands of identical siblings in a ukrainian factory so grey its monochrome
the bullet picked up by a ham fisted ukrainian factory worker is tossed into a crate
the bullet lying in its open crate rolls down a chute where its inspected by a ukrainian military officer holding a manifest
he seems to stare directly at our bullet
to his subordinate carrying a manifest in ukrainian call it agricultural machinery
the bullets crate rattles around in an open bed truck along an industrial road passes a decapitated statue of lenin
the crate containing our bullet is placed on a ship in the cold grey odessa harbor
a container door closes plunging the bullet into darkness
the door re opens
the bullet still in its crate now basks in bright tropical sunshine surrounded by an azure sea
the crate is removed by a pair of slim dark hands revealing a glimpse of the bustling weathered port of abidjan in the ivory coast
the crate is one of dozens unloaded from the ship
bullets pov from another open air truck now slogging through a mud clogged road in lush rainforest
the bullet is unloaded from the truck in freetown sierra leone immediately grabbed by the young hand of a ruf soldier
the bullet is loaded into a round magazine which is inserted into an ak machine gun
the bullet waits in the gloomy chamber
suddenly from outside the sound of raised voices and gunfire
the bullet and its neighbors start to rise quickly up the magazine towards the chamber as the kalashnikov is fired
our hero bullet is next
will it see action
the guns bolt strieks the explosive cap gunpowder ignited the bullet driven out of the barrel
shed of its casing now only a slug the bullet emerges into bright sunshine
it is flying down the main street in freetown
the bullet gives us a perfect point of view of the bullet ahead of it
they are both flying towards their intended target a wild eyed child soldier a boy no more than twelve firing an ak almost as tall as he is
the leading bullet narrowly misses whistles past the boys ear striking the whitewashed wall behind one more pock mark in a building riddled with pock marks
our bullet following close behind finds its mark slamming into the boys forehead just above his left eye his expression oddly relieved
the bullet carves through the lobes of the boys brain where it is enveloped in blood finally plunged into darkness the bullets final resting place
towards a brighter socialist future reads a billboard in the main street
r fifteen year old yuri walks into frame
he spies a long line snaking away from the door of a barren grocery store
i was born yuri orlovitch in the city of odessa in a country that no longer exists
you might have heard of it a little place called the soviet union
a young communist sits in the shadow of a statue of trotsky in the soviet style plaza jacket and neckerchief removed in the summer heat poring over a communist text
yuri approaches pretends to be interested in the statue glances to the young communists book
in subtitled ukrainian looking over the idealists shoulder all property is theft
the young communist nods at this kindred spirit
yuri pats his comrade on the back taking the opportunity to steal the boys red neckerchief and lenin pin
now wearing the pin in his own jacket along with the neckerchief and a stern expression yuri strides to the front of the line in the store
where i grew up everyone was equal
some were just more equal than others
the female store clerk is about to order yuri to the back of the line when yuri flashes the pin
intimidated the clerk smiles and pulls a special tray from under the counter
in contrast to the meager offerings on the shelves the tray contains bags of sugar coffee bananas even pepsi
a soviet style apartment building
front door opens yuri enters shopping bag in hand
his mother irina pokes her head out of the kitchen
yuri holds up a banana
in subtitled ukrainian shortages
irina shakes her head in amazement
while a parade of weapons in red square plays silently on the state controlled tv father anatoly and military cadet older brother vitaly shoulder bandaged sit at a tiny table
drinking cheap vodka and listening intently to an illegal shortwave radio coat hanger for antenna
my father was a wounded hero of world war two my younger brother was wounded in afghanistan a war without heroes
id gotten out of military service due to a heart problem it wasnt completely a lie
yuri joins them careful not to interrupt the broadcoast
he goes to pour himself a glass of vodka
without looking away from the radio his fathers hand grasps yuris in a vice like grip preventing him from lifting the bottle
impossibly upper crust british accent finally in response to human rights protests and in an effort to encourage the united states to sell grain to the soviet union after two
successive crop failures it is reported that the politburo has consented to permit a limited number of jews to emigrate from the soviet union to israel
beat and that concludes this edition of news from the bbc world service
anatoly deep in thought switches off the radio
irina enters puts yuris feast on the table
they speak ukrainian subtitled
incredulous trading jews for grain
reaching for a banana its good p
for the moscow olympics
shrugs good for the jews
all eyes to yuri family confused
yuri contd matter of fact were jewish
scoffing were not jewish
shrug were jewish if we say were jewish
the stunned family stares at him out of the mouths of babes
anatoly finally breaks the silence pours yuri a drink
yuri and the family drink to their new identity
a sea of jewish gravestones
yuri and anatoly bribe the cemetery custodian
there have been few occasions in the twentieth century when its been an advantage to be a jew
under his fathers watchful gaze yuri takes a rubbing from one of the headstones orlov
anatoly with yuri at his side presents the rubbing along with other crudely forged paperwork confirming their jewish ancestry to a clerk
orlovitch now orlov
the rubbing from the jewish headstone was my first forged document
little about my life has been kosher ever since
the clerk gives anatoly and yuri the once over then stamps an emigration visa
suitcase in hand yuri surveys his bedroom for the last time
a car horn
he glances through the window to the communist style plaza below
anatoly beckons impatiently to yuri
vitaly and irina load overstuffed suitcases into an old russian sedan driven by an old russian military officer uncle dmitri
yuri stares at himself in the mirror
he replaces his stolen soviet pin for a necklace a star of david
close up on a heavily retouched photograph of golda meir
shes still not pretty
yuri stares up at it
we russian jews were supposed to be headed for israel but i didnt see much of the country on that first trip
we reveal he is standing in a jam packed standing roam only transit lounge
real jews or fake jews eighty five percent of us ended up in that other promised land
the pan american destination board reads pa to new york
in the distance a roller coaster in coney island silhouetted against the afternoon sky
little odessa new york the camera travels off the coaster to a restaurant apartment above it
we congregated in new yorks brighton beach because of its similarity to the crimean sea
ive always thought its appropriate we moved next door to the circus
a typical jewish establishment with all its paraphernalia menorah on the mantle etc
the family sits in a small dining room attached to the restaurant
anatoly reads the torah as he waits for dinner with yuri and vitaly
i had no idea my father would take his assumed identity so much to heart
i guess he just stayed in character
yuri older as we now know him studies school work
long haired vitaly watches band aid on tv
irina puts a plate of mussels in front of anatoly
glaring at the plate incredulous how many times i cant eat shellfish
youre not jewish
i like it
picking up his felt fedora i like the hat to remind us theres something above us
i like that
anatoly dons his hat
anatoly contd im going to temple
youre not going to temple
you go to temple more than the rabbi
vitaly begins eating his fathers plate of mussels
yuri watches his father exit
i was suffering an identity crisis of my own
we focus on orientation booklets from a careers fair
yuri shuffles between the eagle of the cia and the dove of the u
my gift for languages made me highly sought after
were both heavily recruiting russian immigrants
yuri settles on the dove
the idealistic yuri ill fitting suit full of optimism approaches the united nations building
naturally i went with the u
they were paying more
he strides past luxembourgs gift to the u
a sculpture of a gun with its barrel tied in a knot
never gives it a look
he is greeted at the entrance by an attractive female u
official vivian carlisle
she likes what she sees
the blue helmeted yuri is seated in a white u
armored personnel carrier the background behind him morphs from one third world location to another third world desert to third world rainforest to third world slum
the fastest way to find out you cant change the world is to actually go there
poolside at a recently captured southern style colonial mansion a long way from georgia
gbamga liberia west africas liberia or land of the free was originally established in the s as a homeland for freed american negroes
its been enslaved by one dictator or another ever since
they even copied their masters southern architecture
a tatty pile of weapons some from world war ii sits in front of a long negotiating table
yuri blue beret observes the chief u
envoy at the table opposite warlord andre baptiste leader of the national revolutionary front of liberia nrfl
baptiste s is an imposing figure
in full uniform despite the heat he wears a jacket one size too small as if he cannot admit his extra few pounds
his third wife stands next to him wiping the sweat from his brow like an intermittent windscreen wiper
it was my first meeting with the american educated andre roosevelt baptiste
while the warning signs were all there no one had any idea what a monster he would eventually become
i certainly didnt think he would become my friend
baptiste has a u
document in front of him awaiting his signature clearly enjoying his moment in the sun
referring to the meager pile of weapons with all due respect mr
baptiste you dont seriously expect us to believe that this represents your entire arsenal
envoy contd this is making a nonsense of the embargo ratified by all five permanent members of the security council
the escalation in the build up of arms jeopardizes not only order in the region but ultimately world order
playing to the gallery world order
you say we jeopardize world order
baptistes third wife wipes his brow
baptiste cantd your idea of world order is when youre giving the orders to the world
the envoy has no response
baptiste rises from the table leaving the unsigned document sitting there
baptiste cantd excuse me
baptiste is accompanied by two armed bodyguards
yuris commanding officer captain vivian carlisle motions for one of her detail to follow yuri
irritated by yuris presence i am only going to the restroom
they reach the door marked men
aside to his bodyguards as he enters this is what they mean by u
yuri winces at the remark
baptiste pisses at a urinal
yuri and the bodyguards hang back a respectful distance
taunting yuri arent you going to help me hold my cock
glancing towards the urinal doesnt look like a job for two men
the bodyguards stiffen at the insult
baptiste stares yuri down for a moment then suddenly bursts into laughter
the two bodyguards also start to laugh cautiously
baptiste washes his hands stares at yuri in the mirror smiles
you know you are fighting a losing battle my young friend
war is nature
if you take away the guns we will kill each other with knives
take away the knives we will kill each other with sticks
take away the sticks we will kill each other with your peace treaties
turning to face yuri you cannot stop this bath of blood
its not bath of blood
its blood bath
but i like it my way
baptiste smiles and exits leaving the words ringing in yuris head
a pep rally for the mostly male u
a stage has been erected in the rundown embassy grounds
they chant and stamp their feet impatiently
officer acting as m
approaches the microphone
battling the microphones feedback and now we have a surprise for you
the rd west african peacekeeping corp is proud to present all the way from el salvador the newly crowned miss world ava cordova
from behind a jerry rigged curtain appears the vision that is ava cordova
she wears a dress that appears to have been sewn onto her
she is obscenely beautiful in the squalid setting
the peacekeepers roar and whistle their approval
yuri near the front of the stage is hypnotized
standing closer to yuri than necessary despite the crush is captain vivian carlisle attractive in her own right but pales in comparison with the goddess on stage
she catches yuris reaction
chanting to ava take it off baby
take it off
ava steps up to the microphone
referring to the sea of u
berets baby blue
my favorite color
a roar of approval from the men
ava cantd i suppose i could give you the speech about my hope for world peace but i have a feeling you dont want to hear that today
calling out my hope is for a piece of your ass
they roar again
laughing it off i dont know if youll be taking me to bed tonight darling but you can take her
ava unfurls a life size poster of herself in a swimsuit flirtatiously holding it up against her body
she tosses other posters to eager hands
ava cantd youre all doing a great job keep it up
enjoy the show
on stage a generic looking rock group starts to play a cover from the s tears for fears shout
ava dances enthusiastically provocatively
ava appears to make eye contact with yuri blowing a kiss in his direction
he is paralyzed
backstage yuri and other peacekeepers observe ava escorted towards a huge american car
an inebriated u
peacekeeper tries to get her attention
as the young man reaches out to her a slick handsome business manager shoves him aside
dont touch what you cant afford
the manager slips into the car beside ava
peacekeeper and yuri watch the car roar away
regretting indulging the fantasy lets get drunk
yuri and two other u
peacekeepers get loaded on local beer with local prostitutes one of the peacekeepers pouring beer down a prostitutes throat
from the shadows across the street a liberian man observes the group
yuris colleagues toss some liberian dollars at a waiter and stagger drunkenly away from the bar leaning for support on the prostitutes
yuri remains at the verandah exchanges a smile with a young prostitute at least two years from legal
he knocks back his drink
he approaches the girl presses a few bills into her hand
she picks up her purse makes to leave with him but he motions her to stay
referring to the money whats this
explaining the tip for the smile
yuri exits alone
the liberian man across the street follows
yuri walks down a poorly lit sidestreet
he feels something in his back stops abruptly
his hand reflexively goes to his holster
the young liberian man is holding him up with his own gun
mixing english and french fuck no no no no fuck no
you want money
going through his pockets he starts pulling out loose bills fuck no
dont shoot me
referring to the face on a five dollar bill president lincoln
the liberian puts his finger to his lips to hush yuri
the liberian appears more interested in the gun than the hold up
in flawless english glock
the liberian produces a crisp u
twenty dollar bill of his own offers it to yuri
liberian man contd referring to the face on a twenty dollar bill jackson
yuri stares at the money bewildered
he shakes his head
misinterpreting him you are driving a hard bargain
he hands yuri a second twenty
flabbergasted no keep it
keep the money
keep the gun
offended what do you take me for a thief
the liberian stuffs the money in the pocket of the bewildered yuri
demand and supply
referring to the gun there is more i am thinking where this comes from
incredulous you want more glocks
and the heckler koch g assault rifle
what makes you think ill do that
quizzical i will come back and shoot you with the glock
checking the magazine referring to the bullets by the way do you have the hollow point cartridges
yuri stares at the man
facetious nodding to the gun you got any color preference for that
missing the sarcasm regarding the gun kelly green
meeting yuris eye i will find you
the liberian walks away still admiring his new weapon
yuri stares after him
hed come to the right place peacekeepers are armed to the teeth
and nothing but premium product
mostly buys from switzerland where else
close on two blue helmets lying beside each other
yuri and captain vivian carlisle are under the mosquito netting of a bed in her private quarters trying to get each other out of their respective clothes as fast as
possible mouths and hands everywhere
even in the heat of the moment vivian is unable to completely let go of her work
between heavy breaths what are we doing here yuri
kissing her nipple whatever you want
you know what i mean
here in this country
are we doing any good
finally telling her what she wants to hear would nothing be better
satisfied with the answer she completely gives in to the throes of passion pulls him to her
vivian satiated dozes amongst the rumpled sheets backside exposed
yuri uses the opportunity to take an impression of the key attached to her belt
a white armored personnel carrier sits unattended
the liberian man and two colleagues approach the carriers door
it opens with their newly made key
the men start to unload the weapons inside the carrier spilling a box of ammunition in their haste
the camera drifts off the carrier to reveal yuri behind the barracks counting a thick wad of u
spying a lone bullet on the ground yuri picks it up
we sense he has made a decision from which there is no return
the bullet has been turned into a pendant replacing yuris star of david
yuri wearing a sharp new suit enters the family restaurant
one table of customers not exactly a thriving concern
the starting salary for a u
interpreter back then was
i made fifty k on misplaced weapons on that one trip alone
i doubt the secretary general noticed
spends more on lunch
yuri kisses father and maitre d anatoly who is adding more jewish decoration to the window
he bear hugs mother irina nearly causing her to drop the plates she is carrying
my tour as a peacekeeper was the perfect preparation for war
irina notices the change in her sons appearance
calling after him who are you
youre not my son
my son doesnt own such a suit
yuri flashes his killer smile in response
out of their sight he slips a hundred dollar bill into the cash register and breezes into the kitchen
vitaly now chef in the family business prepares a russian borscht in a kitchen unlikely to pass a health inspection
yuri tastes the food pretends to gag spits it out in the sink
vitaly affectionately cuffs his older brother the joke obviously a familiar ritual
yuri takes his brother to the kitchens rear door
at the back of the restaurant yuri and vitaly sit on the steps amongst the garbage cans
you know whos going to inherit the earth
vitaly looks at him blankly
yuri contd arms dealers because everybody else is too busy killing each other
yuri plonks a glossy arms brochure in front of vitaly
he takes in the contents
regarding his brother its a hell of a fucking career move
thats the point
ive seen how the worlds coming apart
and you want to help with that
you cant stop it
warming to his theme its a basic human need we eat sleep sleep with each other and what else
the oldest human skeletons have spearheads in their rib cages
vitaly is still skeptical
what do you know about guns
joking darkly i know which end id rather be on
adopting a serious tone every day there are people shooting at each other
i think to myself what guns are they using
why not mine
hesitant i dont know
pressing his argument vitaly ive tasted your borscht youre no fucking chef
i can eat here for free and i still dont eat here
youre doing nothing with your life
maybe doing nothings better than doing this
referring to an image of a gun yuri ive actually fired one of these things
yuri puts his arm around his brothers shoulder
thats why i need you
coaxing brothers in arms
vitaly smiles looks sold
anatoly makes his way to the synagogue
yuri hastily adjusting his yarmulke falls into step
pleasantly surprised finally getting in touch with whats important my son
however instead of the synagogue he is fixed on another distinguished jewish man eli kurtzman on a street corner also on his way to temple
it wasnt god i was trying to get close to
anatoly introduces yuri to eli who regards yuri warily
dads contacts at synagogue landed me my first israeli made uzis and an introduction to the biggest of the big guns
a platoon of attractive young women in camouflage mini dresses show off the latest sniper rifles and grenade launchers
an asian businessman pitches hardware to yuri
vitaly is more interested in the girls
brochure in hand i can get you the shoulder fired sa surface to air missiles
the older chinese model
not so effective against modern military aircraft but deadly if used against a commercial airliner
im giving them away at eight fifty
yuri notices that his vendors attention has wandered to a suave older gentleman simeon zaharoff surrounded by eager vendors of all nationalities
the asian man joins the enthusiastic throng
it was the eighties and the cold war was far from thawed
most of the deals were government to government
there were some go betweens freelancers but it was a mostly private club with a lifetime club president
yuri drags vitaly away from the sales girls
the guy eli told me about
brokered deals in the iran iraq war both sides sold missiles to argentina in the falklands
hets a fucking legend
ive got to talk to him
yuri pushes past zaharoffs entourage
a bodyguard tries to step between yuri and zaharoff
stepping between the bodyguard and yuri theyre talking
zaharoff irritated nonetheless humors yuri
may i help you
a mutual friend eli kurtzman from brighton beach import export said to contact you
i have a business proposal
perhaps we can discuss it over a drink
simeon looks him up and down
youre in the wrong place my young friend
this is no place for amateurs
simeon walks away without another word
under his breath in ukrainian yob tvayu mat
yuri watches simeon go surrounded by flunkies
curious how you always revert to your native tongue in moments of extreme anger
camouflage minidress and beret are now discarded on the floor a contrast to the blue helmet seen earlier
yuri and vitaly are getting it on with two sales girls
we pan from one couple in the living room vitaly to the one in the bedroom yuri
we focus on yuri in the midst of the act hears his brothers moans in ukrainian
yuri smiles at vitalys cries
something catches yuris eye on tv
showing images of the aftermath of the suicide bombing at the u
barracks in lebanon
vitaly and i found our niche in under the counter gunrunning regimes suffering under sanctions
a street lined with shelled buildings
beirut lebanon through one of the shell holes we glimpse yuri and vitaly with a the job wasnt so different trom the u
i was just as neutral working for the ununited nations
an equal opportunity merchant of death i supplied every army but the salvation army
we track with them only getting occasional glimpses through the holes as they make their way through the war torn streets of lebanon
we got our start in lebanon after the suicide bombing
they enter a building carrying a crude rendering of a coke sign taste life
the model drinking the coke is ava cordova
inside the warehouse is a ten foot high unruly pile of junked weapons
when the united states leaves a war zone they generally dont take their munitions
it costs more to bring it back than buy new stock
yuri and vitaly usher the customer over to an industrial scale loaded with assorted weapons
i sell by the kilo
the customer checks the combined weight of the weapons
yuri contd shrug theyre second hand weapons but theyre still okay
both men pullout calculators and start haggling over the price
for all my language skills i soon discovered that what talks best is money
as long as you can speak dollars dinars drachmas rubles rupees pesos escudos lira krones kwanzas trancs guilders deutshmarks yen and pounds fucking sterling you can communicate anywhere in the
money is finally exchanged
yuri and vitaly leave the customer with his munitions pot pourri
close on a row of military decorations on an army jacket
army officer colonel oliver southern in dress uniform adjusts the ribbons on his chest in the side mirror of a u
armored personnel carrier
in full view he hands the colonel a cut of the money
the colonel places the money in the same pocket decorated with ribbons
yuri and vitaly walk back along the shelled street yuri recounting whats left of the money
irritated by the meager amount this is bullshit money vit small fucking potatoes
what do we do go more legitimate
vitaly nods thoughtfully
what id give right now for a plate of red cabbage and potatoes
the wall explodes with gunfire
yuri and vitaly drop to the ground money flying
the machine gun fire subsides a shower of dust fragments of brick and hundred dollar bills still floating to the ground
vitaly first to recover draws his own handgun sneaks a look through a shell hole
on the other side of the wall a firing squad of militiamen has executed one group of men lying contorted slumped against the wall
their bound hands and feet give the bodies a macabre awkwardness
yuri is scrabbling in the dust for the cash
the militiamen prepare to execute another six men
we focus on one handsome young lebanese boy barely in his teens
vitaly gun poised goes to intervene
a hand stuffed with cash stops him
the brothers eyes meet
whisper motioning for them to leave its not our fight
vitalys eyes well with tears
after one look back to the teenage boy vitaly reluctantly complies running with yuri heads down away from the scene
as they run the wall explodes again with gunfire
a cardboard cut out planted in a sand dune
yuri and vitaly carry a crate from a taxi onto the desert floor in somalia
a group of muslim freedom fighters eagerly surround the crate yuri hands the leader an uzi machine gun
i sold israeli made uzis to muslims
the muslim leader tests it shooting up the cardboard reagan
his fighters applaud yuri and vitaly slightly embarrassed
a helicopter strains in the thin air to land on the siachen glacier in the himalayas
yuri and vitaly in thick parkas emerge from the helicopter into near blizzard conditions
i sold to both pakistan and india in their fight tor the most inhospitable land on earth
indian troops unseen at first due to their white camouflage uniforms descend on the chopper eager to unload the new guns and ammunition
yuri gasps for breath in the thin air
an indian soldier gives yuri a hit of oxygen as vitaly supervises the unloading
hows it going
admiring a new gun were making terrific progress most casualties from avalanches and frostbite
uncertain smile make sure you thaw out the guns before you fight
yuri nods takes another hit of oxygen
the town is deserted
yuri and vitaly are confused as they prepare to unload an arms consignment from a truck
we had our set backs
its not called gunrunning for nothing
up the street a celebration is taking place a band balloons confetti dancing
finally a congolese man john cannibal ngawe appears at the warehouse
the conversation is in french
from the boat cannibal whats going on
cease fire man
what do you mean its over
were friends man
looking to his unopened crates more and more agitated friends
you cant be fucking friends
last week i spoke to you on the phone
you said you would not rest until every last rebel was dead
you called them vermin
you said would piss in their mouths you said you would exterminate them like cockroaches
just last week you said this
shrug that was last week man
cannibal starts to walk away
cannibal dont you fucking walk away from me
cannibal flashes yuri a peace sign
fuck you cannibal
yuri looks to vitaly
referring to the truck maybe we can offload it the balkans
nodding in agreement at least when they say theyre going to have a war they keep their word
yuri and vitaly stand at a checkpoint in the rugged mountains
guns and ammunition are strapped to donkeys tended by mujahideen fighters
an afghani official inspects the cargo
i even shipped cargo to afghanistan when they were still fighting fellow russians
but i never sold to osama bin laden
not for any moral grounds
back then he was always bouncing checks
i hope youre not thinking of selling these mr
shakes his head personal use
theres a hundred thousand bullets here
im kind of trigger happy
vitaly hands the official his documentation clipped to it a thick wad of bills
the afghani official smiles
he returns to his mud brick border station beside the confiscated merchandise
yuri focuses on a swimsuit calendar hanging on the mud wall miss may is ava cordova
and everywhere i went ava cordova kept following me around
we were as international as each other
we tilt up from the water to find yuri on the deck of a freighter ploughing the ballpoint blue seas off the coast of colombia
north of barranquilla colombia operations like mine provided the only way for certain regimes to conduct a respectable war
vitaly holds onto a railing trying to stave off seasickness not helped by standing downwind from yuris cigarette smoke
the freighter i was standing on carried tons of weapons and ammunition for delivery to one of the poorest nations in latin america in direct contravention of half a dozen
international arms embargoes
yuri makes a call on his cell phone
to keep authorities in the dark i often spoke in code
rocket launchers were mothers the rockets children
assault rifles were apples
the ak was the angel king
into phone the angel king will arrive tomorrow
hallelujah to you too
yuri hangs up
his phone rings with an incoming call
yuri contd into phone yes
slow the fuck down what do you mean tipped off
they know where we are
where are they
yuri grabs a pair of binoculars
on the horizon a fast approaching speed boat interpol agents visible on the racers deck
yuri contd hanging up forget it
vitaly and the captain also spying the customs boat join yuri at the railing
do we run
we have to get out of here
no no ones going anywhere
to the captain slow dead slow
buy me time
yuri swings into action frantically dials another number on his satellite cell phone
yuri contd barking an order to a crewman referring to the panamanian flag get that fucking rag down
the crewman hastily complies
yuris call is answered
yuri contd trying not to sound too desperate its yuri
i need another handle for this tub
something in our weight class
to an elderly latin painter pointing to the stern you over the side
the painter hesitates now
the terrified painter makes for the stern where hes hurriedly winched over
yuri returns to the phone call
yuri contd yes its got to check out
you got a shorter name
how do you spell that
k o n o
he hangs up
yuri contd to the painter already blacking out the name kristol kono
k o n o
the painter nods nervously from his precarious perch starts to paint
yuri sneaks another look through his binoculars
the customs boat is closing fast
yuri contd back into phone what are we flying
hanging up to vitaly vit get me a dutch flag
yuri checks the customs boat again
yuri contd damn theyre hauling
he checks the painters progress
yuri contd agitated grasping the line of the scaffold faster
or i send you in
checking the binoculars again faster
the painters hand is shaking
vitaly is frantically rummaging through a trunk containing dozens of national flags
vitaly cant d i dont have dutch
ive got belgium
what the fuck use is that
panicked gesturing to the stern hes painting a name registered in the fucking netherlands
yuri contd mind racing you got france
confused finding the tricolor yes why
turn it on its side
vitaly turns the flag sideways now a makeshift dutch flag
vitaly nods impressed
yuri looks forward
the customs boat has almost reached the bow of the freighter
the flag is hoisted
the painter barely completing the last o of kono is hauled back on deck
yuri contd thats it
everybody look innocent now
the crew resume their normal duties as the customs boat slows to a crawl itself at close quarters with the freighter
the heavily armed interpol agents eyeball the rusted vessel
yuri focuses on the senior agent jack valentine
while the other agents wear sunglasses long hair tattoo or personalized uniform valentine is completely by the book
his interpol windbreaker clean and zipped to the neck
they say every man has his price but not every man gets it
interpol agent jack valentine couldnt be bought at least not with money
for jack glory was the prize
the customs boat ominously circles the freighter like a hungry shark
valentine never averts his eyes from the ship
not exactly the love boat
another agent hands him a phone
valentine contd into phone its clean
it doesnt look clean
from the railing yuri watches the interpol boat draw alongside the freighter
he surreptitiously makes another phone call
anxious whisper into phone its yuri
phone in a sighting of the kristol south of aruba
the boat is secured to the ladder that runs down the side of the freighter
valentine checks his sidearm climbs the ladder
yuri spies a life ring emblazoned with the word kristol
he flips it around as valentine and the other agents board
valentine strides past yuri to a container nods to an agent to open it
the large metal door opens to reveal a large container full of grain grain spilling onto the deck
valentine is about to plunge his hand into the grain when a mobile phone rings
a crewman calls to valentine from the bridge of the interpol boat
referring to the phone sir sighting of the kristol due north
valentine hesitates returns to the ladder
as the agents go they fail to see the pile of grain shift in the container exposing a crate of assault rifles hidden there
yuri and vitaly watch the interpol boat leap away
on the freighter we focus on the terrified painter standing beside yuri a pool of urine appears from the trouser leg
yuri pretends not to notice slaps the painter on the back
close on the word kono
from the o a paint drop runs down the stern
yuri and vitaly supervise the unloading of the freighter from the dockside
they are alerted by the sound of a battle raging somewhere on the outskirts of the docks
a jeep full to overflowing with heavily armed narco guerrillas suddenly appears at the far end of the dock and speeds towards them
a military vehicle full of colombian soldiers chases the guerrillas several hundred yards behind
the jeep full of guerrillas screeches to a stop by the freighter
the narc leader grabs a box of unloaded ammunition
in spanish hey pay before you play
in spanish youre late
the leader smashes the box on the concrete bullets spilling everywhere
hey fuck you
jamming his handgun in vitalys eye socket fuck you
yuri tries to play peacemaker
reasoning with the narc leader no you dont fuck him the narc leader turns and shoots yuri in the side
yuri shudders with the impact
the enraged vitaly lunges towards the leader but yuri despite his wound holds him back
yuri contd no vit
to the leader referring to the bullets help yourselves
vitaly nurses yuri to the ground
the guerrillas ignore them frantically re load just in time immediately start shooting at the approaching government vehicle
the government vehicle throws a vicious almost toppling over
the guerillas now back in business take off after the government troops
yuri lies on the dock genuinely surprised by the sight of his own blood
the first and most important rule of gunrunning is never get shot with your own merchandise
yuri now heavily bandaged around the waist and vitaly keep a watchful eye as the narc leader inspects crates of machine guns and other ammunition
the second rule is always ensure you have a foolproof way to get paid
credit card check cash
preferably in advance ideally to an off shore account
its why i choose my customers so carefully
say what you like about warlords and dictators they tend to have a highly developed sense of order
they always pay their bills on time
the narc leader nods his approval
referring to yuris wound i apologize for earlier
slight wince i understand
workers start loading the crates into a truck
the narc leader hands yuri the suitcase
its all there
yuri snaps open the suitcase inside six kilos of cocaine
what is this
six keys of pure
incredulous i cant hand this to my fucking bank teller at chase manhattan
hair trigger temper flaring again you should be thanking me
waving his cell phone have you checked the street price today
with the seizures at the border last week its jumped thirty percent
i sell guns
i dont sell drugs
the narc leader walks away
calling after him ive got standards
the narc leader ignores him climbs in his jeep and drives off
the truck loaded with munitions also exits
yuri and vitaly are left alone in their warehouse
staring at their remuneration now what
yuri shrugs slices open one of the packs of cocaine
he takes a bill from his pocket rolls it into a tube
he goes to hand vitaly the tube but his brother has already rolled his own
vitaly dips his tube into the coke snorts keeps snorting a longer inhale than should be possible for a human being
six kilo sized coffee cans
yuri still bandaged is pouring the coffee down the toilet and replacing it with the bags of cocaine mumbling ukrainian profanities as he works
the last bag is missing
sighs exasperated vit
in the hotel corridor yuri discovers the door to the adjacent room wide open
inside the room is vacant
yuri clearly fuming is standing in a standing roam only bolivian public bus along with an assortment of peasants migrants and on the wall of the bus yuri notices a
cellphone ad featuring ava i found vitaly twelve days two thousand miles and grams later in a bolivian boarding house
the outline of ukraine drawn with cocaine
vitaly out of his mind pupils the size of nickels humming a ukrainian folk tune is putting the finishing touches to the map from his badly depleted bag of cocaine
with him two bolivian prostitutes who appear to have passed out or worse
a pounding on the door
open this fucking door
vitaly absorbed with the task at hand appears not to notice
yuri breaks in the door
happy way too happy yuri
to the comatose prostitutes its my brother yuri
hes my big brother
yuri stares at the cocaine map
what the fuck is that
indicating the direction he is going to snort i start in odessa work my way to the crimea staring at the map appalled youll be fucking dead before you reach
yuri opens a window the cocaine blows off the table
vitaly freaks out slams the window so hard it shatters
the hookers still dont rouse
vitaly cantd you fucking fuck
vitaly desperately tries to snort the cocaine out of the shag pile carpet the straw constantly clogging with carpet fibers
blood oozes from vitalys nostril
yuri gazes down at his pathetic brother
an exclusive rehab center
a title appears upstate new york yuris car pulls up outside vitaly in the passenger seat
get out of the car
vitaly doesnt budge
yuri contd i promised our parents
desperate eyes please
vitaly youre going to have a good time
this is a top place
two ford models checked in last week and that cute weather girls been here since july
yuri relents pours a gram onto the dashboard
vitaly snorts it off the dash
as he wipes his nose youre a good brother
vitaly kisses yuri
two orderlies open the car door escort vitaly away
yuri watches his brother in the rearview mirror shepherded up the path
i never understood what separated the recreational drug user from the habitual the functional addict from the dysfunctional
but for the grace of god it could have been me snorting lines as long as the belt parkway
irina lights a candle in front of the virgin mary
vitaly never got completely clean despite the prayers of my mother
anatoly prays in front of the menorah
in fact my younger brother was the only reason my father ever had to question his new religion
an executive sits in his business class seat
on the tray table in front of him calculator and spreadsheets
after colombia i became a one man operation
a sole proprietor as you say on your tax return that is if youre foolish enough to fill one out
he exchanges a collegial smile with yuri who has similar entrepreneurial paraphernalia in front of him
by then id mastered my craft
selling arms is not so different to selling vacuum cleaners
you advertise pound the pavement take orders
the businessmans smile dissolves when he catches a glance at the brochure lying next to yuris day runner glossy photos of it takes place in an unidentified country in north
of course a good arms dealer also has to be a political scientist
i go by a seven step approach
yuri gets off a plane
one identity a government and an opposition where the opposition is ignored
yuri immediately picks up a newspaper eager for the latest news
two wait for a radical group to break away from the opposition
yuri is buoyed by the front page news over tips the newspaper three immediately approach the radical group and offer them arms
yuri meets a group of revolutionaries in a backstreet bar shows them an arms catalogue
four whether they buy or not inform the government that the radical group approached you and offer the government arms
yuri meets a government official in the parliament buildings shows him the same catalogue
five whether they buy or not re approach the radical group and offer them more arms but now at a higher price
increasing tension is a means of generating demand and the ideal situation is to sell to both sides
yuri meets the revolutionaries a second time in the same bar this time they are more enthusiastic and yuri has his calculator out
six if they start shooting at each other the escalation is underway
yuri now accompanied by bodyguards is escorted into the government buildings where hes given a fat envelope
back at the bar yuri is given an even fatter envelope
they are consuming small arms and ammunition and the cash register is well and truly ringing
yuri stands at his hotel window sneaking a look through grimy venetian blinds
a street battle is taking place
however in yuris mind the sound of the gunshots is gradually replaced by the sound ot a cash register
each time a gun is fired the register rings
yuri shuts the window
seven dont forget that the success of a radical group in one country can inspire a radical group in a neighboring country
yuri boards a plane taking off for a new conflict zone
yuri leans back in his business class seat eyes closed
they suddenly blink open
he feels someone watching him
sure enough he is face to face with ava cordova staring at him from a magazine cover in the seat pocket next to him
a gallery of models from the late eighties on vogue harpers bazaar elle magazine covers blown up and framed on a white wall
an agent with a window office overlooking park avenue talks on the phone
in front of her the headshot of ava cordova
into phone theres really no one else youd consider
christie and brooke are both available
not the right look
its just that ava doesnt generally do print
the agent examines an envelope stuffed with cash
agent contd however since you are willing to double her rate and pay cash in advance
she loves working with herb and you say the campaign will only be seen in asia
examining a first class plane ticket destination st
barts i certainly cant see her objecting to the location
inspecting an itinerary what is the product again
yuri talks on a phone as he browses at an arms show
he stops at a display of handguns
into phone the product
a beat the beer
an idyllic beachfront hotel
ava cordova enters an empty reception area
the receptionist hands her a fax avas face falls
yuri sits by the deserted pool observing her entrance
it cost me twenty for the fake booking another twelve to buy out the hotel
you cant force someone to tall in love with you but you can sure make ita damn sight easier
a large restaurant overlooking the ocean
ava and yuri are the only guests both eating alone
they make eye contact exchange polite smiles
ava strolls down to the beach deserted save for yuri sunbathing some distance away on one of the hundred empty sunbeds
ava dives into the water
behind his sunglasses yuri watches her
towelling off on a sunbed of her own ava glances over to yuri
it seems crazy not to speak to each other
ava breaks the ice
calling to yuri popular hotel huh
ava approaches extends a hand
ava contd ava cordova
what brings you to st
a photo shoot
at least that was the plan
but the photographers plane got stuck in miami
hurricane though there was nothing in the news
gazing out at the ocean those things can come out of nowhere
the jobs cancelled and theres no flight back to new york til tuesday
yuri pretends to ponder her predicament
you can hitch a ride with me if you like
ava regards him cautiously likes what she sees
yuri contd picking up his own camera in the meantime why dont i take your picture
ava smiles poses playfully for him
in my experience some of the most successful relationships are founded on lies and deceit
since thats where they usually end up anyway its a logical place to start
a limousine approaches a lear jet parked on the tarmac of the one runway airport
yuri and ava exit the car
i nearly went broke trying to convince her i was anything but
i knew ava was not the kind of woman to be seduced by a ride in a private jet unless you owned the jet
close on the tail of the jet the name orlov air
holding her skirt in the wind to protect her modesty this is your plane
shrug that is my name
they enter the plane
of course i was lying
the plane was a rental like the car and even the suit i was standing in
at the last minute i bribed the crew for the paint job
as the plane picks up speed on the runway the name orlov smears
luckily by the time we landed ava wasnt looking anywhere but in my eyes
yuri and ava sit beside each other on a white leather sofa in the customized cabin drinking cristal champagne
yuri glances through vogue magazine a photo spread on ava
ava takes in the planes sumptuous appointments
pretending to be impressed with the photos i had no idea
he hands her back the magazine
yuri cantd im sorry i didnt recognize you
you must think me very rude
i put on clothes for a living
wry grin at least you arent taking them off
smiling at his irreverence i would be if half the photographers had their way
shrug but i cant complain
im paid to say cheese
meeting his gaze what about you
nothing so glamorous
im in transport international air freight mostly
what like ups or something
something like that
glance to her champagne flute business is good
like you i cant complain
they both drink
a thought occurs to ava
but if you did
i dont know
reluctant admission its just that i travel all around the world but i cant help feeling sometimes that im going nowhere
ava regards him closely
hes echoed her thoughts
yuri pours ava another drink
yuri contd heres to
raising his glass a hurricane
yuri contd without it id never have met you
she meets his eye
this is no accident is it yuri
yuri freezes doesnt answer
ava contd it feels like fate
never averting his eyes i dont believe in fate
what do you believe in
yuri gazes at her a moment he answers her question with a kiss
ava does not pull away
clouds rush by the faces of yuri and ava heads close to the planes oval windows
they make love in a wall to wall bed built into the rear of the jet
the camera moves past the couple through one of the planes windows and the clouds begin to rain
yuri and ava run through the paper shower as they descend the steps of a synagogue in brighton beach
we married in a synagogue to make my father happy
in the eyes of my catholic mother it was worse than living in sin
yuri and ava kiss his parents anatoly and irina
as the happy couple reaches the limousine vitaly out of rehab and out of his mind fires an ak into the air as a salute
the guests drop to the ground the only ones left standing are yuri and vitaly
yuri stares daggers at vitaly helps ava to her feet
explaining to the guests its traditional
meekly echoing the remark joke badly misfired traditional
the guests nod uncertain
yuri cantd one more time vitaly
vitaly lets go another burst
yuri contd reassuring word as he whisks ava into the car im sorry
i should have said something
yuri carries ava over the threshold of their new home to cheers of the assembled guests
anatoly and irina gape in amazement at the grand house
they draw their son aside
touching his yarmulke always remember son theres something above you
looking up gently joking sure dad
a forty thousand dollar crystal chandelier
anatoly forces a smile
irina presses a gift into yuris hand
yuri contd mom we dont need anything
you need this
irina takes anatolys arm they walk away
yuri alone for a moment opens the package a small roman catholic bible conveniently bookmarked at the ten commandments
a newborn baby boy nicolai plays in the wrapping paper of opened gifts beneath an extravagantly decorated christmas tree
new york december i was still living way beyond my means mortgaged to the hilt using one credit card to payoff another
anything to keep ava in the style to which she had thanks largely to me become accustomed
then suddenly all my christmases came at once
a family christmas anatoly irina and ava open gifts
baby nicolai wriggles on a blanket trying to reach a piece of tinsel
to irina regarding a nativity scene on a christmas card jesus was jewish
youre worshipping a jew
irina ignores him
she regards a gift a silver goblet set from tiffanys
ava this is too much
yuri likes to spoil you
nicolai crawls an inch
ava beams proudly
you did it
thats my grandson
ava looks around for yuri
calling out yuri
dont you want to see what your son is doing
ava wraps the piece of tinsel around the babys head
a loud shout from the other room
tak fucking tak
ava scoops up the baby
with anatoly and irina they go to investigate
on the television mikhail gorbachev is making his famous speech officially ending the cold war
yuri kneels in front of the tv as if it is an altar
what the hells the matter
the cold war the soviet union the evil empire
mikhails saying no mas
hes throwing in the towel
yuri kisses ava nicolai anatoly irina kisses the tv
referring to nicolai your son is crawling
yuris too busy kissing gorbachevs birthmark
he gazes at the tv revelling in the plan taking shape in his head
in the living room ava and irina play with nicolai
yuri and anatoly drink johnnie walker black label
contemplating the days events at least therell be religious freedom
i think ill go back for a visit
trying to sound casual do you stay in touch with uncle dmitri
face lighting up dmitri volkoff
now and then
how is he
the luckiest man alive
you know he was one of the first men at chernobyl
off duty at his daughters wedding he was roaring drunk
he was the only one who survived
later they found that alcohol in your blood resists radiation
hes still a general in the army
he got promoted
two of his rivals were also there that day
i told you hes the luckiest man alive
he may be luckier than you think
yuri goes to pour himself a drink
anatoly grabs his sons hand the way he did many years earlier
lowering his voice were not fools yuri
whats between you and your wife is your own business but i dont think youre going to odessa to open a mcdonalds
meeting his sons eye is this how you want to be remembered
shrug youre only remembered when youre dead
yuri knocks back his vodka tries to lighten the mood
yuri contd ill bring you back some caviar
its not kosher
vitaly and a call girl angel dressed in a low cut fairy dress stumble through the front door both the worse for drink and drugs
merry fucking christmas
the family gazes at vitaly and his friend appalled
paternal vitaly who is this
her name really is angel
shes a fairy
hoisting angel lets stick her on top of the christmas tree
vitaly and angel laugh
no one else does
vitaly collapses on the floor
vitaly cont d at a loss for anything better i love you all
yuri firmly escorts angel to the door and pays her off
yuri drops vitaly back at the exclusive rehab center
by now yuri knows the routine
he pours a gram onto the dashboard
im going back to ukraine
vitaly snorts it off the dash
maudlin i miss odessa
i miss you
i miss you too
vitaly kisses yuri
vitaly contd meeting his brothers eye be careful yuri
those things you sell kill
tapping yuris chest where his heart should be inside
two orderlies open the car door escort vitaly away
yuri stares after vitaly
ava and nicki kiss yuri goodbye
yuri enters a public storage facility opens a locker with a combination lock
theres no problem leading a double life
its the triple and quadruple lives that get you in the end
he produces several passports from the locker shuffles the passports like playing cards
back then i carried a french british israeli and ukrainian passport and a student visa for the u
but thats another story
the locker also contains five identical briefcases presumably he can tell them apart
i also packed five different briefcases depending on the region of the world i was visiting
light snow falls
yuri driving a brand new mercedes waits in a long line of cars at the border
izmayil ukraine january the end of the cold war was the beginning of the hottest time in arms dealing
the wall had fallen
the arms bazaar was open
those forty five years had generated the highest weapons build up in history
the soviets had tanks and guns coming out the demon hole huge stockpiles and now no enemy
a border guard approaches yuris car window
in english checking yuris passport visa
yuri hands the guard his passport
inside a credit card emblazoned visa
the guard smiles
border guard contd cash or check only
yuri smiles hands him several u
yuris passport is promptly stamped
he is waved past the line of cars
its good to be home
yuri briefcase in hand meets his uncle dmitri at a barracks
nb dmitri always carries a hip flask of vodka as if there is a constant threat of radiation poisoning
nephew come here and hug the luckiest man alive
the general gives him a great bear hug
dmitri registers the apprehensive look on yuris face
dmitri contd what
did you think id be glowing
you cant catch it
yuri kisses dmitri on the cheek to reassure him
over his shoulder dmitri notices the car
referring to the car this is the slk
dmitri is impressed
yuri has a stack of vcrs cartons of cigarettes johnnie walker black label on the table in front of dmitri who drinks from his hip flask throughout the conversation
i cant just sell you government property yuri
i have to report report to who
as of last week moscow is in a foreign country
shrug new flag new boss
there is no new boss yet
theyre too busy squabbling over who gets the presidential holiday home at the black sea
dmitri cant deny it
yuri contd talking like an evangelist its beautiful
the ones who know dont care any more
the ones who care dont know
nodding to a safe built into the floor show me your inventory
dmitri hesitates knocks back his vodka then opens the safe produces a document
crates of machine guns from floor to ceiling
dmitri gives yuri a tour of the armory
how many kalashnikovs do you have
referring to the inventory in his hand
looking over dmitris shoulder is that a
it doesnt look like a to me
it looks more like a
missing the point no its a
its whatever we say it is because no one else knows the difference
dmitri finally gets it
yuri examines a kalashnikov
yuri contd kalashnikovs for a battalion
your stocks are dangerously depleted dmitri
you should order more from the factory
this is too much for dmitri
he stops confronts yuri takes back the ak yuri is inspecting
someone will work this out yuri
what happens then
shrug well cut them in
anyway what could happen youre the luckiest man alive
the sun sets over a grassy field
yuri sits alone closely inspects a kalashnikov
it is a strange moment between a man and his favorite gun
as we hear yuris thoughts we are treated to lovingly shot close ups of the weapon and its features often seen in slow motion sun glistening off the chromed barrel
folding metal stock arcing elegantly into place
precise docking of the round curved magazine
avtomat kalashnikova model of more commonly known as the ak or kalashnikov
its the worlds most popular assault ritle a weapon all fighters love
an elegantly simple nine pound amalgamation of forged steel and molded plastic
it doesnt break jam or over heat
it will shoot whether its covered in mud or filled with sand
its so easy even a child can use it
and they do
the russians put the gun on a coin
mozambique put it on their flag
since the end of the cold war the kalashnikov has become the russian peoples greatest export after that comes vodka and suicidal novelists
one things for sure no one was lining up to buy their cars
we reveal where yuri is sitting on the roof of a rusting russian sedan the vaz door
a goat is eating the upholstery
yuri checks on the crates of ak s being loaded into a convoy of trucks
in the background the armory full a week ago is now virtually empty
yuri smiles a satisfied smile
his reverie is interrupted by the sound of a car horn
a commotion at the gate
another large black mercedes is parked there driver leaning on the horn
yuri smiles as he sees the passenger emerge from the car simeon of course my idea was not entirely unique
i had rivals
simeon angrily confronts the soldier at the gate
dmitri puts on his cap about to investigate
yuri stops him
hes a friend of mine
dmitri shrugs and complies
yuri strides towards the gate
simeon flanked by two hefty bodyguards is in the face of a young the officer is flanked by three soldiers kalashnikovs resting on their hips
do you know who the fuck i am
thick ukrainian accent who the fuck cares who the fuck you are
i demand to see your commanding officer
you dont demand shit
simeon reconsiders his position
just give me back my papers
papers clearly visible in his hand what papers
the officer turns on his heel and returns to his guard station with the passport starts watching tv
the bodyguards make to follow but the soldiers close ranks barring their path
youre late simeon
yuri breezes past the soldiers with an easy familiarity
he enters the guard station as if he owns it
from beside his car simeon watches as yuri jovially discusses the situation with the young officer
after a moment yuri slips the officer money in exchange for simeons passport
yuri emerges from the station and returns the passport to the veteran gunrunner
yuri contd i invited you for a drink once before
perhaps now you will accept my invitation
yuri and simeon sit at a table near the back of the bar
yuri flirts with the barmaid delivering drinks and a shellfish appetizer
to yuri impressed you sell guns
maybe youd like to come to my room and see my bazooka
the barmaid giggles and exits
simeon is clearly disquieted by the change in the balance of power or maybe its the bad early nineties pop music
his bodyguards sit at the table behind
you look a little lost simeon
is the world changing too fast
i am here arent i
not all of you i think
simeons look begs explanation
yuri contd youve gotten so rich selling for the cia you cant get that ideology completely out of your head
the empire was evil for too long
i cant deny it takes some getting used to
last week we were trying to beat their brains in and now were going into business together
theres no place in gunrunning for politics anymore simeon
i sell to leftists rightists
id sell to pacifists but theyre not the most regular of customers
yuri leans forward
yuri contd of course youre not a true internationalist until youve supplied weapons to kill your own countrymen
simeon regards the young man with a mixture of fear and admiration pours himself another drink
i understand you have ukraine in your pocket but there are the other satellite states
bulgaria hungary poland belarus
instead of cutting each others throats it may be more profitable to work together
what do you think
yuri smiles the proposal is the victory he has been seeking
i think you are the amateur now
i think you suffer from a philosophical disadvantage you have a philosophy
i think you should go with your instincts your first instinct
simeon is confused
yuri contd i am the same man who was not good enough for you before
i am not good enough for you now
yuri gets up
simeon holds his rivals arm
the problem with gunrunners going to war is theres no shortage of ammunition
yuri and the barmaid never make it to the bed
still clothed they bang each other against the door of his hotel room
back then it was all for sale
row after row of tanks armored personnel carriers and helicopter gunships in mothballs
helicopters torpedo boats armored personnel carriers whole tank divisions
dmitri flask in hand and yuri are given a tour of the surplus hardware by one of dmitris brother officers
haggling over the gunships ill tell you what ill do
buy six you get one free
what about tech support
yuri and dmitri come upon an oily faced boy perched on the cockpit of a helicopter gunship he wears an ill fitting uniform several sizes too big
son get off there before you get hurt
sheepish hes the tech support
incredulous hes twelve
shrug kids grow up fast around here
nodding to the gunship he can take it apart in his sleep
yuri shrugs shakes the majors hand
the pov from a pair of binoculars in the crosshairs jack valentine at a surprise checkpoint staring through binoculars of his own
who are you
yuri on his belly to avoid detection slithers back to the roadway hands the binoculars to a young soldier
dmitri stands beside the convoy of trucks parked barely out of view of the checkpoint including yuris mercedes and a huge open bed tractor trailer carrying a russian hind helicopter
yuri contd angrily to dmitri i thought we were supposed to be watching for these checkpoints
how can i
you keep selling my helicopters
youre too greedy yuri
anxious we have to go back
dmitri regards the trucks each one longer than the road is wide
well be going in reverse
we cant turn around for a mile
the young soldier on lookout calls to them
yuri grabs the binoculars
sure enough valentine and his agents are climbing into their interpol jeeps and driving towards them
we shoot it out
shaking his head and start an international fucking incident no no no
so we run
ive got paperwork
protesting not for the gunship
yuri you know the penalty for sanction busting selling a military helicopter
yuri gazes at the russian mi v helicopter gunship bristling with armaments
its not a military helicopter
its a rescue helicopter
yuri turns to the boy referred to as tech support
yuri cant d get to work son
the boy pulls a wrench from his pocket
the interpol jeeps crest the rise and pull in front of the convoy valentine and his agents exit guns drawn
dmitri and the ukrainian soldiers stiffen their weapons also at the ready
an uneasy stand off
yuri gestures for calm
he greets valentine warmly offers his hand
in reply an interpol agent unceremoniously slams yuri into the side of his truck
flashing id papers
again yuri waves off dmitri and his men about to come to his aid
yuri courteously hands over his passport and other documentation to the skeptical valentine
valentine contd regarding the photo closely mr
orlov always in the wrong place at the right time
weve met before
off the coast of colombia
feigning memory loss what was the name of that freighter i cant remember
was it the kono or the kristol
hesitates hes actually forgotten the crew called that vessel a lot of names none of them repeatable in polite company
valentine turns his attention to the helicopter now devoid of its weapons
an interpol agent escorts yuri at gunpoint
yuri contd noting to the gun in his ribs the new mp
do you need a silencer for that
valentine ignores the banter inspects yuris documentation
the end user certificate for this aircraft states burkina faso
did you type it yourself
its for humanitarian missions
youre a humanitarian
yuri shrugs why not
valentine contd not buying it for a second this is a killing machine
not any more
in broken english listen to the nephew
yuri has had the armaments detached
didnt you get the memo
the wars over
what can they do with military hardware but convert to civilian use
trying to lighten the mood the only way you could die from this baby is if a food drop hits you
valentines face hardens at the flippant remark
still at gunpoint yuri is escorted to the smaller second truck in the convoy
stacked inside the container are the helicopters hurriedly removed missiles and the boy
referring to the missiles also going to burkina faso
pointing to the document but to a different client at a different address
valentine incensed throws yuri up against the truck himself
what do you take me for
a complete fucking fool
eyeing valentines gun pressed to his throat not complete sir
and while i hesitate to tell you your job i must point out that when shipped separately the weapons and the aircraft both comply with the current interpol trade standards
incredulous you expect me to believe this is a coincidence
i can see how certain people might interpret it as suspicious but thank god we live in a world where suspicion alone does not constitute a crime
valentine regards yuri closely this foe is more formidable than he imagined
valentine looks to the gun in his hand contemplating crossing the line
he finally holsters his gun
tosses the documents on the road yuri orlov
you and i are going to be seeing a lot of each other
i can hardly wait
climbing into his jeep watch out for the time you dont see me
yuri dmitri and the boy watch valentine speed away
perfect american accent what an asshole
yuri looks to the boy askance a yuri in the making
yuri supervises the loading of the cargo onto a freighter
checking the empty trucks he is just in time to see simeon and his henchmen climb into their car parked beside his own car some distance away
as he drives off simeon and yuri make brief eye contact
yuri looks for dmitri exiting a nearby restroom carrying his hip flask as usual the worse for drink
referring to the departing simeon what was he doing here
zipping his pants trying to beat your offer
i sent him on his way
he doesnt understand the concept of loyalty
dmitri glances at the soldiers around the docks
dmitri contd speaking of loyalty too many people know
i have to make pay offs
therere more vcrs
i left them in your new car
dmitris face lights up
yuri hands him the keys to the skl
even your enemy was admiring that car
i am the luckiest man alive
dmitri hands his hip flask to yuri
yuri watches dmitri walk to the car and climb in for a test drive
a look of realization on yuris face
screaming to dmitri dmit
the car erupts as if it has been punched by a fist beneath the earth
recovered from the blast yuri runs up to the burning car but is beaten back by the flames
close on a bent mercedes medallion now worn around the boys neck
he regards it forlornly
yuri numb still carrying dmitris hip flask makes a call from a payphone
a darkened bedroom
ava is fast asleep in her bed curled up with the phone rings
half asleep ava reaches for it
still groggy yes ill accept the charges
we cut between the two sides of the conversation
ava hey baby
glancing to a clock am you forgotten what time it is
talking about anything other than whats on his mind how was your audition
resigned smile theyre going in another direction
the direction of someone who can act
dont say that
and youre biased
ava grabs her robe goes to the balcony so as not to disturb nicolai
sensing something amiss where are you
is everything okay
rough day at the office
we miss you
more desperate than he intended hows nicki
asleep in our bed
its lonely without you
from a bar down the street comes the sound of gunfire mobsters firing at other mobsters escaping in a car
yuri tries to cover the phone but ava overhears
ava contd yuri whats that
its always a party where you are
more gunfire interrupts
id better go
i just wanted to call hear your voice
kiss nicki for me
i love you
but yuri has gone
the freighter slips out of the harbor
in ukraine since billion worth of arms have been stolen and re sold
one of the greatest heists of the th century
crates of munitions are unloaded from the freighter onto waiting trucks under yuris supervision
the primary market was africa
eleven major conflicts involving countries in the past decade a gunrunners wet dream
yuri sizes up the militiamen loading the arms
my best customer was self declared president of liberia andre baptiste
even though wed met before i was in no hurry to meet him again
hed gotten a reputation for routinely hacking off the limbs of those who opposed him
his seven year civil war has been described as a relentless campaign of sadistic wanton violence unimaginable to those unfamiliar with the details of mans capacity to visit the abyss
that kind of sums up andy for me
as the final truck door is secured a customized lincoln continental convertible comes flying around a corner stereo blaring deliberately terrorizing the locals on the dock
the car slides to a stop beside yuri
it contains andre baptiste jnr
a handsome young man with sunglasses a mirror for an earring and a facial tattoo
also in the car two bodyguards and a pair of liberian teenage girls dressed in dallas cowboy cheerleader uniforms
yuri i am andre baptiste junior
my father would like to meet you
thank him but i have other business
a busy schedule
it is not optional
my father is easily offended
yuri ponders for a moment
the machete in the bodyguards hand makes up his mind
what do you know
my schedule just freed up
a bodyguard takes yuris suitcase
yuri is barely in the car before it screeches away
as the car roars along the highway on the edge of control we hear yuris thoughts
but if i thought i was scared of andre senior i knew i was scared of andre junior
like father like son
the guava doesnt fall too far from the tree
he was a heavy drinker a womanizer with a penchant for cheerleaders and a lover of fast american automobiles which he drove recklessly and with total impunity around the streets
of the capital
oh yes he was also a cannibal
they say andre would eat a victims heart while it was still beating to give him superhuman strength
i couldve told him hed get the same effect from a pastrami sandwich at carnegies deli
andre announces his arrival in the main street of monrovia with a burst of gunfire
the city a violent clash of cultures
goats and gucci
monrovia itself was like being on another planet
from the temperature it was obviously a planet close to the sun
i rarely saw another white man even at my hotel that was soon dubbed the little kremlin
and i never left town alone
outside town was the edge of hell
i didnt want to even gaze into it
the car pulls up to monrovias premier hotel
a dead body on the ground attracts no attention whatsoever
this is your hotel
proudly two stars
a porter carrying yuris suitcase steps over the dead body
contd to yuri can you bring me the gun of rambo
part one two or three
confused i have only seen part one
nodding the m
you want the attachable grenade launcher
and the armor piercing bullets
revving the car i will be back to get you in an hour
mischievous smile we left a welcoming present in your room
yuri nods uncertainly
yuri enters the hotel
at the reception desk two hotel porters watch a small portable tv cnn coverage of the o
simpson trial gruesome evidence photos
never averting his eyes from the screen my god he nearly cut off her head
when i get to america i will not live in brentwood
the concierge hands yuri a key
yuri goes to open his hotel room door hears music from inside enters
two stunning liberian girls sit naked on the bed bopping to madonnas lilike a prayer
in the most aids infested region of the globe where one in four is infected andres idea of a joke was to put a young iman and a young naomi
naked in my bed and no condom within a hundred miles
wed be happy to make you happy
the two goddesses drape themselves around him
dont worry we dont have anything
how do you know
do we look like it
fending them off but with little commitment what if i have aids
dont you worry
glorias lips gently touch his
you worry too much
faith begins to unbutton his shirt
sultry why worry about something that can kill you in ten years when there are so many things that can kill you today
glorias hands go to his belt buckle start to unfasten it
how can we make you happy
with great reluctance yuri reaches behind him and opens the door
faith and gloria still buck naked are tossed into the hallway their clothes flung after them door slammed shut
and a beretta mm sitm on the ostentatious mahogany desk in front of president of liberia andre baptiste a few pounds heavier still wearing the same size uniform
watches over his shoulder
andre baptiste examines each handgun methodically
in front of him a pensive yuri taking in his surroundings
half a dozen gun toting elite guards keep an idle watch
several hostesses tend to a refreshments table
on a nearby sofa a lieutenant flirts with one of the hostesses
baptiste glances over to the lieutenant irritated
providing a commentary thats the beretta comes with a cartridge easy operating clip baptiste tests the loading mechanism
the lieutenant on the sofa is still not paying attention
baptiste casually points the gun at the lieutenant and shoots him in the head a large portion of his brain splattering across the fleur de lis wallpaper
yuri contd shocked jesus why did you do that
baptiste clearly not used to having his actions questioned turns the gun on yuri
what did you say
yuri staring down the barrel of the beretta recovers fast
feigning anger gesturing at the gun now youre going to have to buy it
grabbing the gun from baptiste its a used gun
i cant sell a used gun
baptiste is taken aback
he suddenly bursts into laughter
a used gun
thats a good one
the other officers laugh uncertainly
the lieutenants body is dragged out leaving a smear of blood across the marble floor
baptiste seemingly oblivious to the carnage hes wreaked resumes talking to yuri in a measured way as if hes discussing the sad state of punctuality in contemporary society
baptiste cantd confiding in yuri theres no discipline with the young boys
i try to set an example but its difficult
i blame the mtv
yuri nods disguising his terror
baptiste checking his rolex oyster rises from his desk
baptiste contd let me show you something
the camera tracks along the militia however only the very tops of their heads are visible
i had heard of the boy brigades small boy units kalashnikov kids
the theory was that a bullet coming from a fourteen year old is just as effective as one trom a forty year old
andre baptiste haggles with yuri as he inspects his troops ranging from twelve to fourteen
yuri averts his eyes from the boys uncomfortable reviewing soldiers a head shorter than he
older soldiers fill the ranks behind
i cant pay your asking price yuri
we are not a rich people and the market is already flooded with your kalashnikovs
in some places you can buy one for the price of a chicken
you cant just look at the unit price
you forget the ancillary costs
end user certificates need to be forged and notarized shell companies set up insurance purchased pilots and crews hired
not to mention the bribes
you cant get a nut and bolt out of the eastern bloc without a bribe
theres one bribe for the nut
another for the bolt
this is an expensive proposition
andre interrogates yuris eyes
i pay in timber
baptiste produces a handful of uncut diamonds from his pocket
yuris eyes widen at the sight of the very precious stones
regarding the stones ill take the stones
its hard to get a tree trunk in my hand luggage
he turns to his new lieutenant
referring to the inspection very professional lieutenant
dismissing the troops dismissed
yuri and andre watch the troops disperse
i know youre planning a new offensive
if you delay a week i can get you the armored personnel carriers we talked about
they would give you a significant strategic advantage
andre nods grateful for the free tactical advice regards yuri in a new light
they say i am the lord of war
but perhaps it is you
correcting him its not lord of war
i like it my way
andre smiles again
they are going to be fast friends
he leaves yuri alone to examine his uncut diamonds in his hand
diamonds are far less bulky than hundred dollar bills
you can get a million dollars into a cigarette box
a go between emerges from a gallery with a wrapped painting hands it to yuri waiting in a limo
by the mid nineties my wealth had caught up to my lies about my wealth even surpassed the lies
yuri pays the go between in cash places the painting in the trunk
yuri enters the front door drops his luggage at the door
ava talking excitedly on the phone hangs up runs to greet him
vitaly in the background cocktail in hand with another dubious looking girlfriend is examining another of avas paintings
yuri i just got off the phone with the dealer
i sold my first painting
yuri and vitaly greet each other with a nod
feigning surprise fantastic
who bought it
they want to remain anonymous
asking in a way that does not expect an answer how was your trip
same old same old
quickly changing the subject wheres nicki in bed
he tried to stay up
ill kiss him goodnight
opening champagne this calls for a drink
still giddy at the news my first painting
im officially an artist
he watches ava showing off more of her paintings to vitaly and the latest girlfriend
i figured i was a patron of the arts and of everything else ava had tried and failed at after modelling
acting her own cosmetics line
i didnt sabotage her careers but i cant deny it was convenient for me in maintaining a low profile
she was a beautiful bird in a gilded cage
yuri kisses his sleeping son nicolai now three years old
he places a gift at the end of his bed an expensive looking microscope
at the same time he spies an object in nicolais toy box a toy gun
yuri tosses the toy gun in the trash
vitaly still in the kitchen catches him pretends he didnt see
how are you brother
shrug you know still the resident family fuck up
someone has to do it
they watch ava in the living room sharing a joke with vitalys girlfriend
she knows right
we dont talk about it
vitaly looks askance
yuri contd shrug how many car salesmen talk about their work how many executives at cigarette companies
and both of their products kill more people every year than mine
at least mine has a safety switch
if those guys can leave their work at the office why cant i
shit youre good
you almost had me convinced
to his girlfriend knocking back his drink were going baby
yuri and ava are alone at the window overlooking central park
he hands her a fresh glass of champagne
raising his glass for a toast to manet monet
and ava cordova
ava grins goes to drink when she notices two huge diamond earrings laying at the bottom of the glass
shrug the trip went better than expected
fishing out the damp baubles yuri theyre beautiful
flirtacious grin but what am i going to wear them with
flirting back i know just the outfit
close up on the diamonds dangling from avas ears
she wears the earrings and nothing else as she and yuri make love
i didnt know how much she knew and how much she ignored
i was a good provider and as far as she was concerned loyal
despite the other women i always made love to ava as if she was the only one
from an unmarked helicopter jack valentine and his interpol agents shadow a mercedes sedan as it weaves through midtown traffic
yuri rides in the back seat of the sedan scouring the world affairs sections of several newspapers
a thought interrupts his homework
he opens the sunroof a crack spies the helicopter tailing the car
he closes the roof
to the driver take park
the sedan enters the underpass beneath the helmsley building for a moment the car hidden from aerial surveillance
to the driver this is good
the driver pulls over never coming to a complete stop before yuri bails
horns blare at the illegal drop off
yuri contd to the driver from the sidewalk take them on a tour of the tri state
yuri grabs avas painting from the trunk and the sedan pulls back out into daylight minus yuri the occupants of the helicopter none the wiser
yuri hails a taxi
valentine observes the sedan cruising through the heart of yonkers
where in gods name is he going
is he lost
with some reverence yuri props avas painting against the wall of his private sanctuary then goes about his business shuffling passports deciding who he will be
ava dressed in a robe all smiles pours herself a cup of coffee
she sips the coffee at the window glances down
in the courtyard below interpol agents are picking through the garbage cans under the supervision of agent valentine
valentine curiously examines the toy gun
the smile is wiped off avas face
she makes brief eye contact with valentine before stepping back from the window
slightly shaken she picks up the phone and dials
into phone vitaly
the cargo hold of an ilyushin cargo plane
its so overflowing with weapons many are strapped into the passenger seats
sierra leone i was now the best merchant of death alive
i didnt own my own plane
i owned a fleet running guns into liberia sierra leone or the ivory coast at least once a week
unfortunately my friends at interpol were also starting to find west africa on the map
most trips i had phoney paperwork
if the deadline was tight i had no paperwork at all
in the cockpit an american pilot and co pilot keep an idle watch on their instruments as they fly over the endless plains of sierra leone
yuri sits in the jump seat reading the wall street journal
to his co pilot even taking into consideration the pay off to the parents a week with a girl in burkina faso is cheaper than a night with a girl
plus theyre cleaner and a lot of them speak better english
shrug personally i prefer a language barrier an unmarked military jet appears through the starboard window
the voice on the radio is familiar
charlie echo india
descend for landing on heading zero
the pilot picks up the radio looks to yuri
yuri shakes his head dialling his satellite phone
yuris call is answered
into phone trying not to sound too desperate colonel southern its yuri
sorry to call you on this number but ive got an interpol jet and the jet outside the window falls back
a mid rank office dominated by a computer terminal
we look over colonel southerns shoulder
he is admiring a new medal
two other men in suits sit opposite
into phone measured voice i cant know you right now
its not a good time
southern hangs up
yuri hearing the response explodes
gaping at the phone in disbelief not a good time
suddenly machine gun fire strafes the ilyushin bullets tearing through the fuselage perilously close to yurirs very combustible cargo
the jet appears again at the window
radio charlie echo india
that was your last warning
where was the first fucking warning
radio rock your wings if you intend to comply
to yuri anxious im putting us down
incredulous you land and were all going away
i dont have paperwork
incredulous were in a flying fucking bomb
theyre firing bullets at our bullets
forget about going away
they shoot again were going away for good
im putting us down
knowing hes right okay
the pilot responds on the radio
into radio this is charlie echo india
descending on heading zero two nine
the interpol jet takes the lead towards a small airport
yuri surveys the terrain below getting his head back in the game
pointing out a narrow highway not the airport
its our only fucking hope
concerned a pothole could set us off
dont underestimate yourself
youre the best tony
the pilot doesnt buy it but reluctantly changes course anyway
from his own wingseat valentine observes the ilyushins detour landing on the highway
i cant land there
to the pilot he cant get far
i want a truck waiting on the tarmac
a heavily trafficked highway
women carrying water jars on their heads a thin cow pulling the carcass of a car vendors selling dry meat children playing war games
the pedestrians look up to see the lumbering ilyushin making its final approach they scatter
the ilyushin weaves on landing hits a bone jarring pothole
inside the plane boxes of grenades bullets and other munitions jump dangerously up and down
finally the ilyushin pulls up safely on the highway engines shutting down
yuris head appears out of the cockpit window
curious locals recovered from the shock are gathering at the side of the road
to the pilots sizing up the locals were going to be okay
the pilots are already halfway out of the plane door grabbing supplies as they go
yuri contd calling out from the window where are you going
as far from the evidence as i can
the pilots start running down the highway
wait you idiots
theres not going to be any evidence
stay with the plane
the pilots ignore him run for their lives
yuri is left alone
he turns a lever marked cargo bay
the rear cargo bay opens
yuri stands beside his incriminating merchandise
to the gathering locals help yourselves
be my guest
one local man tentatively approaches the cargo bay
yuri hands him an ak and a box of shells
more sierra leonese locals emerge from the side of the road seemingly out of thin air
yuri hands out more guns
yuri contd to other locals take the whole crate
two men oblige ferrying the crate away
the other locals become bolder then brazen
soon its a free far all
men women and children swarm all over the plane pilfering the arms and anything else that isnt bolted down also a lot that is
yuri has to exit the plane to avoid being trampled in the rush
yuri buys a fanta from a vendor exchanging it for a box of grenades
he sits on a soda crate for a front row seat at the chaos
yuri has a calculator out totalling his losses
muttering under his breath shutting off the calculator in disgust what a fucking disaster
yuri sees the pilot seats being stolen
hey not those
you dont touch the plane
plaintive moan not the fucking seats
glancing up the highway yuri sees an approaching cloud of dust valentine and two truckfuls of heavily armed interpol agents
the last of the guns and ammunition are being carted away on the back of a thin cow
valentines truck fishtails to a halt beside the stripped plane
valentine is first off the trucks and into the planes cargo bay empty
other interpol agents fan out futilely questioning locals
miraculously the weapons have vanished into the bush
valentine calls out to the last fleeing local a boy with a lifevest
the boy stares back defiantly inflates the life preserver
valentine contd exasperated forget it
the entire cargo has gone
an errant bullet falls off a shelf in the plane and rolls down the floor valentine picks it up
yuri sits innocently on his soda crate
a frustrated african interpol agent mbizi wound up by the chase rushes yuri slams him to the ground
you run from us
flashing a machete in yuris face can you run with no legs
valentine rushes over pulls mbizi off yuri
no no no
valentine drags mbizi out of yuris earshot
mbizi still wants a piece of yuri valentine preventing him getting to the gunrunner
let me disappear him mr
he is a devil
let me disappear him
i cant do that
look where we are
who will know
mbizi stops struggling against valentine
turn your back mr
i will go to hell to stop him
to his agents find the pilots
mbizi and another agent reluctantly head off in a truck
valentine returns to yuri who is dusting himself off
valentine handcuffs yuri himself picks up the soda crate and sits yuri back on it
valentine contd ive spent my whole career on the right side of the line
youre the first man ive encountered who makes me seriously consider crossing it
whats the charge
what are you doing in sierra leone
im on safari
referring to the bullet shooting wildebeests with submachine guns
are you with the park service
hunting without a license is that the charge
youre trafficking arms
but without evidence who can say
trade or traffic you make a fortune by keeping the poorest people on the planet killing each other
hesitates unsure whether to waste his breath wastes it anyway do you know why i do what i do
yuri remains handcuffed sitting on the soda crate dwarfed by the cargo plane
valentine paces beside him
valentine contd ignoring him there are more prestigious assignments you know
keeping track of the nuclear arsenals
you would think it more critical to world security
nine out of ten war victims today are killed by assault rifles and other small arms like yours
those missiles just sit in their silos
your ak its the real weapon of mass destruction
yuri regards his interrogator curiously
despite the sun beating down he feels obliged to give him his version of the facts of life
i dont want people dead agent valentine
i admit a shooting war is better for business
but id prefer people to fire my guns and miss
just as long as theyre firing
he regards valentine with something approaching pity
yuri contd i realize the unspeakable things that are done with my weapons
i also understand the unspeakable things that are done with williams sonoma carving knives and wilson baseball bats and they arent taking those off the market any time soon
people will always buy guns
why not mine
valentine appears to have no answer
yuri contd can i go
youve got nothing on me unable to resist but cuffs
now valentine smiles
i am legally permitted to hold you for twenty four hours without charging you
yuri looks away knows where this is going
valentine contd you may ask why do i bother to do that
i can assure you it is not because i enjoy your company
and you may be surprised to learn that it is not for any vindictive motive
the reason i delay you for every second of the permissible twenty four hours is that i am delaying your deadly trade and the deaths of your victims
i dont think of it as taking a day from you but giving a day to them
some innocent man woman or child somewhere has one more day on this earth because you are not free
valentine looks to his watch
valentine contd see you in twenty three hours and fifty five minutes
valentine walks away
yuri is left to ponder the notion
we see time lapse photography of yuri waiting out his twenty four hours under armed guard on the highway stretching his legs eating a suspicious looking sandwich going to the
bathroom the sun arcing across the sky all the while his plane is being cannibalized by the locals
finally the time lapse slows back into real time
valentine returns in a jeep with mbizi and other agents
youll be pleased to know your colleagues were no more co operative than you
valentine opens the back of the jeep
lying in the back the bodies of the two pilots shot and stripped
valentine contd the locals got to them before we could
yuri turns away from the sight
his handcuffs are removed
returning yuris documents valentine notices a photo of ava and nicki in the wallet
valentine contd handsome family
valentine and the agents get back in the truck and drive away
yuri starts to walk down the deserted highway alone his cargo plane is now just another carcass in the jungle
a convoy of armored personnel carriers barrels past him the color u
the lead car slams on its brakes bringing the train to a stop
a woman pokes her head out of the window captain vivian pleasantly surprised yuri
giving her an embarrassed hug vivian
what are you doing here
approaching the window you know
fighting the good fight
an aid program
in fact ive just had some transport problems
you couldnt give me a ride to monrovia could you
yuri steps back into a vehicle with which he is very familiar
vivian cant d were pulling out
its too dangerous
its a shame
we were really doing some good things
yuri nods in understanding
a weary yuri enters his room
sitting on the green sofa bound and gagged face reduced to pulp silver hair matted with blood jesus
a flunky and his cheerleaders appear from behind the door laughing at his shocked reaction
yuri contd andre
what in heaven is he doing here
a gift for you
yuri stares into the old gunrunners terrified eyes
contd you got here just in time
i was afraid he would die before you got a chance to kill him
he offers yuri a beretta
who do you think informed on you cost you your plane
he came to meet my father hoping to take your place
yuri spits on simeon
you stupid old fuck
knowing smile he killed your man when he tried to kill you
andre again offers yuri the beretta
confused you want us to let him go
andre offers him the gun a third time
yuri refuses it
so you do want him dead
you just dont want to kill him yourself
andre grabs yuri and presses the gun into yuris palm clasping his own hand over yuris
well do it together
a bonding experience
andre forces yuris finger onto the trigger as he aims at the terrified simeon eyes pleading
yuri attempts to pull his hand away but andre is too strong
you can stop if you want but you do
just say the word
andre stares at yuri not simeon
contd say stop
yuri opens his mouth but no word comes
andre presses yuris finger onto the trigger
the gun goes off
a splash of blood across the sofas green upholstery
the gunshot echoes around the room
simeon is very dead
surveying the blood spattered room ill get you another room with a nicer view
yuri collapses on the bar gestures to the barman who immediately pours a line of cocaine in full view
yuri hoovers it up
i started doing a lot of cocaine in west africa
i wasnt medicating myself
i was simply playing catch up
i was constantly dealing with people who are chemically imbalanced without the aid of chemicals
its just a matter of etiquette
its rude to act sane in a room full of lunatics
the barman nods to a patron at a corner table a seasoned fighter no more than eighteen years old
he bought you brown brown mr
wiping his nose what
what is it
laughs a mixture cocaine and gunpowder
what does the gunpowder do
they give it to the small boys before battle they do anything
some other time
you have to try it at least once mr
the barman starts chopping another line
laughing because its your gunpowder
sure enough the barman pours the gunpowder from one of yuris mm shells into the cocaine
the seasoned fighter assault rifle slung over his shoulder intimidating air sidles up to yuri stares him down
yuri has no option does a line
he washes it down with a swig from a vodka bottle raises his glass to the fighter
the barman puts on a ukrainian folk song
yuri picks out one of the prostitutes in the bar starts dancing
he drunkenly dances with one prostitute after another the dance almost violent the prostitutes flung aside none lasting more than a few seconds caught in the arms of the other
to yuri the bar swims before his eyes
the music stops
yuri wild eyed looks at the stunned bar room
to no one in particular whipping his vodka bottle off the bar im going for a walk
yuri staggers towards the edge of town still swigging from his bottle
yuri eyes unable to focus stares at a womans face in front of him moving back and forth
the gyrating stops
yuri realizes he is lying in the mouth of an enormous cement pipe on his back a prostitute on top of him
she gets to her feet adjusting her dress
yuri panics hurriedly zipping himself
a mixture of french and english i didnt fuck you did i
did i fuck you
in french as she counts yuris money its not what i would call a fuck
the prostitute tosses a couple of bills back to him
yuri ignores the money staggers after her
are you sick
she ignores him
yuri contd screaming are you sick
yuri staggers to his feet wanders aimlessly across a field
two dozen pairs of feet chase each other on a dirt field to cheers from a crowd
the dust clears revealing a bundle of cloth and string doubling as a soccer ball
the game is between two indistinguishable teams of monrovian youngsters on a makeshift dirt field goalposts constructed from tree branches lashed together
yuri wanders onto the field joins the game without asking
the players humor him by letting him have the ball
yuri dribbles up field takes an enormous swipe at the ball misses completely clattering to the ground
the crowd and players laugh
the game goes on
yuri also laughing but in a far more desperate manner picks himself up and wanders away
yuri throws up at the back of a saloon flimsily constructed from rusted corrugated iron
rinsing out his mouth with vodka he is distracted by the sound of two little girls arguing
ask the foreigner
the foreigner will know
the girls approach yuri no older than seven formal white dresses hands politely behind their backs
sir will my fingers grow back
one of the girls shows yuri a healed stump where her hand should be
yuri runs away
yuri passes in front of an abstract arrangement of holes that turns out to be a building pock marked with gunshells
suddenly a face appears in one of the holes simeon
the gunshot wound in his forehead still evident
simeon turns and walks away revealing a large exit wound in the back of his head
yuri contd simeon
yuri pokes his head through the hole but simeon has vanished
yuri turns back to find himself trapped by two men in flip flops shorts gap t shirts and ak s
through yuris eyes the two men look like four
the two four men go through yuris pockets take his watch shoes
yuri is oddly compliant clumsily helping one of the thieves fasten the watch
one of the men tired of yuris antics aims his gun at yuris head
his colleague stops him
keeping his gun raised fuck andre
seemingly beyond caring yeah fuck andre
the man fires at yuri
the gun jams
yuri looks almost disappointed
the man tries again
again the gun jams
referring to the gun im sorry
they dont usually do that
let me have a look
maybe i can fix it
disgusted fuck off
the man whips the gun across yuris face
yuri face streaked with blood and dirt wanders aimlessly through the brush outside monrovia
a hyena appears on the dirt path in front of him teeth bared frenzied eyes
yuri stares at the wild dog starts to quietly cry
tears roll down his cheeks
the hyena runs away
yuri is alone
a vacant eyed yuri sits in the shadow of an enormous stack of arms unloaded from a freighter
a presidential motorcade appears on the dock
andre baptiste emerges out of his mercedes jeep gun in his hand
he strides up to yuri
yuri you fucked up
i am going to shoot your face off with your own gun
yuri doesnt flinch
unfazed regarding the man not bad
andres latest double
the mans face falls
the real andre baptiste emerges from the car with to yuri standing beside his uncanny double how did you know
hes too eloquent
you have no heart
baptiste brandishes a copy of the new york times
have you seen the news
they accuse me of rigging elections but after this in your florida with your supreme court of kangaroos close on the headline u
supreme court reverses recount ruling
andre baptiste contd now the u
must shut up forever
yuri just smiles
more good news
thats the last aid shipment
the war is so bad the u
is pulling out
he regards the inactivity at the dock
why is nothing happening
reluctant to give his father bad news no trucks
they are trapped on the front lines
there are trucks
you just have to get all that food out of them
yuri gestures down the dock where food is being loaded into trucks marked humanitarian aid andre baptiste and andre jnr
are clearly taken with the idea
killing certain humans can be considered humanitarian
thinly disguised reference to the previous night isnt that right mr
andre baptiste hands yuri his payment a slim briefcase containing a pouch of uncut diamonds
after surviving the last few days id started to feel like i was invincible
but there was a weapon that could hurt me
from behind the cover of a sofa nicolai shoots at an unseen foe his finger as the gun
the camera pans around the room to find ava in an armchair opposite hush nicki
to valentine i dont believe you
valentine is unfazed
ava contd can you prove any of it
where is your evidence
i was hoping you could help us with that
opens an old file containing a copy of a newspaper clipping headlined cordova disappearance i understand your parents died tragically in ei salvador
meeting avars gaze that regime has startling similarities to several of the regimes supplied by your husband
valentine rises to leave
ava holds nicolai her mind reeling
impossibly thin models strut along a transparent lightbox of a runway flanked by socialites and paparazzi
projected on the wall behind them the words fashion against hate dress not to kill and various images from the worlds warzones
each outfit is enthusiastically applauded
and now one of the sponsors of tonights evening former miss world ava cordova
ava appears from behind the wings in a designer gown
she modestly accepts the applause gradually becomes aware of a projection on her face
she turns to see the projected image of a child holding an ak
when she turns back tears are rolling down her face
back to us ava naked sits on the end of her bed clothes laid out beside her
yuri still carrying his suitcase appears in the doorway
he drops the case
ava whats wrong
still with her back to us hes with your parents
yuri senses something very wrong
why arent you dressed
i thought we were going out
he finds a robe from the closet gently places it around her
she pulls it off her shoulders
turning back to look at him i cant wear the clothes
i cant wear the jewelry
i cant drive the car
i cant live in this house
everything s got blood on it
yuri pulls the robe back onto her shoulders walks to the window
dont be so melodramatic
ava pulls the robe to her follows yuri to the window
of course im melodramatic
im a failed actress remember
we need to talk about it
we never have before
now we do
yuri notices the interpol business card on the bedside table
these people you cant trust them ive talked to your parents
why do you think they dont want your money
they know where it comes from
we all know
yuri sighs resigned
i sell people a means to defend themselves ava
i dont hold a gun to any ones head and make them shoot yuri i see the news
sierra leone i dont sell machetes
what do you think is pointing at the victims when they use those machetes
i see the pictures
yuri the guns are bigger than the boys
angered theres nothing illegal about what i do
i dont care if its legal its wrong
ava meets his eye
ava cont d i can accept the drugs
i can even accept the other women
i cant accept this
yuri looks away
looks back it makes no difference if i stop
someone will take my place the next day
we have enough
youre not that little boy in odessa anymore lining up for a loaf of bread its not about the money
what is it
he doesnt answer perhaps he doesnt have one
ava looks out of the window at their expensive view
ava contd i feel like all ive done my whole life is be pretty
all ive done is be born
im not just a failed actress
im also a failed writer failed artist failed businesswoman
im not much good as a mother
come to think of it im not even that pretty any more
ive failed at everything yuri
turning back to him but i wont fail as a human being
the words finally register with yuri
you cant leave
as if trying to convince himself ill stop
ava is skeptical
he holds her reassures her
yuri contd ive been thinking about it for a while
a lot lately
as if trying to convince himself im making more from the oil and timber anyhow
further reassurance ill stop
she interrogates his eyes for the truth
pleading eyes you will
deadly serious yes
changing the subject a millisecond too fast now get dressed
well go out
ava picks up the dress off the bed
yuri gazes at her
yuri contd by the way youre wrong about not being pretty any more
she turns back and smiles
a young interpol agent carrying a tray of coffee approaches a plain panel van parked outside yuris apartment building
for the next month i stopped running guns
i went legitimate
the van door opens to reveal valentine and other interpol agents wearing headsets monitoring a scanner device
the agents read porn to keep themselves amused except valentine
no wonder valentine was confused
yuri toys with his old bullet pendant as he talks on the phone
for once the spreadsheets in front of him deal with oil and timber
thank god there are still legal ways to exploit developing countries
with the cordless phone to his ear yuri wanders to the kitchen
he tosses the pendant down a trash chute
back in the den yuri punches a calculator as he continues his phone call
but the only problem with an honest buck is theyre so hard to make
the margins are too low
too many people are doing it
finally we are privy to the conversation
into phone impossible
two and a quarter
i cant make a profit at two and a quarter
why dont you take my oil and ill fucking pay you
yuri hangs up stares down from his apartment window
valentines panel truck drives away
night has fallen over central park criss crossed by a necklace of lights
yuri continues to stare out of the window
he is perplexed by the sight of a diplomatic motorcade parked in front of his building
before he can make sense of it the house phone rings
confused yuri the president of liberia is in the lobby
yuri stunned for a millisecond recovers with a smile
glance to his watch hes early
andre baptiste is admiring his new uniform in a gilt edged mirror
is flirting with two teenage girls residents of the building
the perplexed doorman stares at the motorcade outside his door flashing lights on the police escort
to the girls you should come to liberia with me tomorrow
it is beautiful this time of year
is that on long island
yuri ashen faced hurriedly exits the elevator into the ornate lobby strides up to andre snr
nervous as hell what the fuck are you doing here andre
hugging yuri were here for the peace talks at the u
pulling him out of earshot of the curious doorman anxious whisper so at the same time you thought youd drop in on your arms dealer
is that what you still are
youre a hard man to get hold of all of a sudden
but now you mention it we are doing a little shopping while were here that is if you open for business
anxious look past andre to the motorcade on the street theyve got to be watching
disdainful shrug of course they blame me
they always blame me
they are on a unable to resist hunt for a witch
a smile for once correcting yuri witch hunt
but i have been granted diplomatic immunity due to the escalation in hostilities
conspiratorial that is why i need you
they are making life difficult to re supply
it will require a man of your unusual ingenuity
i cant help you
nods i understand
he shakes yuris hand firmly
andre baptiste contd but you should know that our present difficulties compel us to be unusually generous
yuri realizes that andre has placed a huge uncut diamond in his hand
andre baptiste contd hugging yuri farewell lord of war
you still havent brought me the gun of rambo
andre baptiste and his son breeze out of the lobby
yuri enters sits in an armchair
ava and nicolai are cuddled on the sofa ava reading him a fairytale
looking up from the book was that about the oil or the timber
ava smiles carries on reading
yuri looks to his hand we rack focus to the uncut diamond
yuri gets up
yuri still in his suit stands in a dumpster searching
at four and a half months a human fetus has a reptiles tail a remnant of our evolution
amongst a pile of rotten food he finds his necklace containing the you can fight a lot of enemies and survive but if you fight your biology you always lose
yuri places the bullet around his neck
ava is fastening eight year old nicolais coat readying to go out
yuri half dressed appears in the hallway
hey not even waiting to say goodbye
im leaving in ten minutes
sorry nicki has swim practice
nicolai kisses his father
hugging him see you big guy
ava kisses yuri
teasing him personally im glad youre going
youve been here so long youre starting to get on my nerves
taking the teasing good naturedly this oil concession should be wrapped up by thursday
ill be back for the weekend
well go somewhere the sea
that would be fun
a thought occurs to yuri
you trust me right
yuris turn to interrogate her eyes
she looked me directly in the eye the way ive looked in the eyes of a thousand customs officials government bureaucrats and footsoldiers from every law enforcement agency in the
world and she lied without flinching
yes i trust you
shed learned from the best
ava gives yuri a final kiss hurries nicolai out the door
from the rear seat of a mercedes sedan we observe yuri exiting the apartment building and entering a waiting mercedes sedan of his own
to the driver thats him
we reveal ava and nicolai in the car
yuris car pulls away and avas car follows
confused where are we going mama
its a game
like hide and seek
yuri locks his storage locker observable from the street and exits the facility carrying a passport and briefcase
i can always sense when im being tailed
i know what to look for
but then id never been tailed by the woman i love
returning to his car yuri fails to notice that ava has witnessed his routine from her own car
instead of following the car ava exits with nicolai
ava nicolai in tow approaches yuris locker
she tries a combination fails
tries another fails
a third same result
i can put myself in avas place
she might have understood if the combination was the last four digits of my social my birthdate even her birthdate but not nicolais
ava looks to nicolai tries one more combination reluctantly
close on the numerals on the lock
my sons birthday unlocked what the government would later describe as a catalogue of carnage
the lock opens
whisper to herself not that
not that yuri
ava opens the storage room door at first struck by the exhibition of her paintings inside the locker
shaking the image from her head she turns her attention to the briefcases and other documents
she shuffles through the passports in horror different photos of yuri different names george eagleman georges daigle etc
who is her husband
is he any of them
vitaly is back at work in the kitchen of the family restaurant
yuri approaches vitaly senses something amiss
come to see how the other half lives
i miss your borscht
mom and dad say youre clean
they said you went legitimate hard to believe
thats because its not true
vitaly is hardly surprised
yuri glances to his parents anatoly and irina at the restaurant counter folding napkins observing their two sons
they avert their eyes
only you know
im leaving tonight on a job
i want you to come
im thinking of opening my own place
maybe this trip will help
its good money
looking to his parents ive given my word
they dont have to know
well tell them were going for a little r and r
why do you need me all of a sudden
west africas fucked up
off vitalys look more than usual
i cant trust anybody
i need someone to watch my back
the notion touches vitaly
yuri closes the deal
yuri cantd brothers in arms
vitaly looks to his parents
they stare at him until he averts his eyes
vitaly cant refuse his brother
a fork in the road
two large trucks slog through the bush take the left fork
sierra leone yuri vitaly and andre jnr
are in the cab of the truck beside the andre is admiring his new m machine gun with attachable grenade launcher the gun of rambo
concerned by the route where are we going
ruf freedom fighters
yuri stares out of the window
every faction in africa calls themselves by these noble names liberation this patriotic that democratic republic of something or other
i guess they cant own up to what they usually are federation of worse oppressors than the last bunch of oppressors
often the most barbaric atrocities occur when both combatants proclaim themselves freedom fighters
the truck passes a checkpoint marked by two skulls
a tent city
a jeep packed with young machete wielding freedom fighters circles the refugee camp taunting and terrorizing the inhabitants
the mostly women and children are trapped by the circling jeep
whenever a refugee attempts to escape they are driven back by the increasingly manic shrieking rebels
yuris two trucks are parked on the roadway above the camp where the rest of the rebels are massed a rag tag mob wearing over sized sneakers carrying machetes and
the occasional ak
at a small folding table a rebel leader negotiates with yuri and andre jnr
the leader places a pile of uncut diamonds on the table
vitaly is more interested in the camp observing the circling jeep full of rebels and their smirking comrades on the highway
from a distance he spies a woman and young son make a desperate bid for escape from the camp
two rebels on foot give chase
the woman appears to be pregnant
vitaly watches in horror
the woman is quickly overtaken and hacked to death
then the boy
vitaly cant look turns away
vitaly comes to a horrific realization
he hurries to yuri still negotiating with the rebel leader
yuri i need to talk to you
to the rebel leader excuse me
vitaly draws yuri out of earshot
irritated by the interruption what
anxious whisper we cant do this deal
incredulous the fuck we cant
referring to the camp look over there
as soon as we leave theyre going to die
averting his eyes from the camp its not our business
protesting they killed a boy just now as young as nicki
the suspicious rebel leader and andre jnr
approach the two brothers
whats the hold up
trying to keep his poise there is no hold up
ill be right there
yuri draws vitaly further away
yuri contd vitaly its what we always know we cant control what they do
today we can
theyre right there close enough to touch
angry impatient what do you think theyll do if we back out theyll kill us
and if we go ahead theyll kill them
the rebel leader approaches again this time hes not leaving
what is he saying
vitaly realizes the futility of the discussion backs down
youre right yuri
getting his head back in the game did i hear you say ipgs assault rifles and grenades
i thought it was grenades
id better check
yuri pats his brother on the back returns to the negotiating table
vitaly heads for the trucks
for once we follow vitaly
regards vitaly warily
the prongs of a hammer on a box of grenades
vitaly is prying open the lid
appears behind him m poised ominously on his hip
what are you doing
something for yuri
step away slowly
vitaly closes the lid a ruse
he picks up the hammer and in one sudden violent motion swings it across andres face smashing his jaw teeth flying andres body flopping like a rag doll
vitaly grabs two grenades from the box pulls the pin from one and bowls it into the truck
the truck explodes in a fireball instantly incinerating andre jnr
yuris head whips around
the rebel leaders head whips around
vitaly dashes for the second truck
the rebel leader opens fire raking vitaly with machine gun fire still trying to run with legs torn to shreds
yuri contd no
a second hail of gunfire all rebels firing
vitalys legs betray him
he collapses to the ground in a pile of blood and dust
we focus on vitalys still face he has taken enough bullets to kill him three times over
but he is not quite dead
agonizingly slow he raises the grenade hand to his mouth pulls the pin with his teeth
close on vitalys hand trying to summon the strength to throw the grenade
a hand appears grasps vitalys hand gently but firmly removing the grenade
the rebels keep their guns trained on yuri unsure where his loyalties lie
yuri holds the fate of the camp in his hands he could still toss the grenade destroy the second truck sacrifice his life
yuri stares to his brother and then to the grenade in his hand
he reaches down and delicately takes the pin from between vitalys lips
the eyes of the brothers meet for the last time
yuri inserts the pin into the grenade disarming it the life goes from vitalys eyes forever
yuri removes any last doubt by tossing the disarmed grenade to the rebel leader
yuri walks away from vitalys dead body and returns to the negotiating table yuri now the living dead
the rebel leader looks to the two trucks one burning one not
he removes half of the diamonds from the table
yuri sits in the cab staring out of the window as the truck drives away
vitaly broke the cardinal rule of gunrunning
never pick up a gun and join the customers
the truck turns the bend
in the background true to vitalys prediction the rebels descend on the tent village firing indiscriminately with their new weapons
yuri hears the sound we detect a barely perceptible flinch
a lone gun crate emptied of its contents has been put to use as vitalys makeshift coffin
coffins are hard to come by in sierra leone
demand is so high
fortunately we had a lot of boxes just the right size
americas funniest home videos plays on a tv set
the canned laughter appears to be almost directed at yuri who is making a long distance call on a geriatric telephone
we arent privy to the conversation
i dont know which is worse jewish guilt or catholic guilt
my parents were like gods tag team
we pull back to reveal the makeshift coffin sitting at yuris feet
but i could not deny them the chance to say goodbye to their eldest son
close on the screen of an x ray machine
innocuous oversize cargo passes in front of the screen a surfboard a double bass then the crate containing vitalys body
for twenty monrovian dollars a doctor removed the lead from vitalys body and wrote a bogus death certificate
i should have paid more
the operator of the machine stops the conveyor belt
ive smuggled millions of rounds of ammunition and the bullet that lands me in jail is found under my dead brothers rib
in vitalys chest a bullet
the other oversize items move down the conveyor belt for collection yuri waits with two burly porters
no other items are appearing finally the coffin containing vitaly
two atf agents appear behind yuri
flashing some id yuri orlov were with the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms
resigned smile regarding the insignia on their jackets believe it or not i only use the first two
the agents are not amused handcuff yuri
you have the right to remain silent
they march him away
a phone rings
ava out in the hallway surrounded by suitcases looks to the phone senses the identity of the caller
she hustles nicolai out of the door closes it behind her
the phone continues to ring
yuri on a payphone in the jailhouse corridor reluctantly hangs up
he makes another call
anatoly lighting a candle picks up the phone
anatoly looks at the telephone receiver in his hand without another word he passes the phone to irina
anatoly walks away
into phone both my sons are dead
close on a slug in an evidence bag tossed onto a table by valentine
the agent can scarcely contain his excitement
yuri sits at the small table stares at the slug
one of yours
yuri doesnt take the bait
two other agents sit at the back of the room observe the interrogation
valentine contd referring to a document curiously the death certificate says he died of heart failure
shrug maybe he did
referring to the slug if i saw one of those coming at me ld have heart failure
the flippant comment gets under valentines skin but he keeps his temper in check
we performed the autopsy and released your brothers body to your family
you tried to do something decent yuri
you went against your nature
and now its cost you
unable to resist your brothers funeral is looking a lot like your funeral
falsifying a death certificate
thats not going to hold me
youre right as usual
yuri not so cocky now waits to see where this is going
valentine contd putting a copy of the new york times in front of yuri have you seen todays paper
a front photograph of valentine posing beside yuris documents including his five briefcases
the headline reads merchant of death in custody
caption catalogue of carnage
valentine contd pacing lauding it over yuri fake end user certificates cut out companies all meticulously catalogued
theres hardly a dictator warlord or despot anywhere in the world you arent on first name terms with
producing another evidence bag containing avas diamond earrings and an engagement ring your trophy wife gave us the prize
she also provided us with these which we suspect are conflict diamonds
yuri takes all this in
valentine contd she has agreed to testify against you
yuri nods picks up the newspaper
but instead of reading about his own front page news he opens the paper turns to world affairs various items on the warzones at the end of the millennium
yuri reads takes his time
valentine cannot believe his audacity
finally yuri reacts
a broad smile his killer smile
tell me that i am everything you despise that i am the personification of evil that im responsible for the breakdown of the social fabric of society and world order
that i am a one man genocide
say everything you want to say to me now because you dont have long
valentine is infuriated by yuris casual demeanor
are you not paying attention or are you delusional
youve broken every arms embargo written
theres enough in those briefcases to buy you consecutive life sentences
youll spend ten years going from a cell to a courtroom before you even start doing your time
yuri is looking away apparently completely unconcerned
his attitude further angers valentine
valentine contd you dont seem to fully appreciate the seriousness of your situation
snapping back his emotion finally showing my family has disowned me
my wife and son have left me
my brother is dead
trust me i fully appreciate the seriousness of my situation
but i promise you i wont spend a single second in a courtroom
valentine laughs derisively
you are delusional
yuri is still unfazed
he leans forward to close the deal
i like you jack
well maybe not
but i understand you
you feel your loyalty to your badge has finally been rewarded
but you havent counted on the people who gave you that badge
valentines turn to hesitate
yuri contd meeting valentines gaze let me tell you whats going to happen so you can prepare yourself
yuri nods to the interview room door
yuri contd soon theres going to be a knock on that door and youre going to be called outside
a montage of scenes yuris prediction plays out accompanied by his commentary
a knock at the door and an agent nods to valentine
in the hall there will be a man who outranks you
sure enough a decorated military officer talks to valentine in the hallway as yuri describes
first he will compliment you on the fine job youve done how youre making the world a safer place and then he is going to tell you that i am
to be released
we observe valentines reaction vigorously arguing with his superior
you are going to protest you will probably threaten to resign
the officer still turned away from us tries to calm valentine
the door to the interview room opens
but in the end i will be released
yuri exits the cell to freedom
we return to the present
valentines eyes burn into yuri
glancing to the open newspaper the reason ill be released is the same reason you think i will be convicted
i do rub shoulders with the most vile sadistic men calling themselves leaders today
referring to the newspaper but some of those men are the enemies of your enemies
valentine is starting to get a sick feeling
yuri contd and while the biggest arms dealer in the world is your boss the president of the united states who ships more merchandise in a day than i do
in a year sometimes its embarrassing to have his fingerprints on the guns
sometimes he needs a freelancer like me to supply opposition forces he cant be seen supplying
you call me evil but unfortunately for you i am a necessary evil
there is a long silence
then valentine and yuri exchange a look
valentine rises from the desk
i would tell you to go to hell
but i think youre already there
valentine turns on his heel
he is at the door when yuri finally replies
what if im not
what if i sleep fine at night
what if i sleep better than you
i think thats what truly scares you
valentine doesnt look back exits
sure enough the officer is in the hall as yuri predicted colonel southern
a car trunk closes on yuris five briefcases and other documents
yuri is escorted out the rear entrance of the city jail to the nondescript sedan by colonel southern
as hes ushered into the car southern hands yuri yet another briefcase
colonel southern ushers yuri into the car hands him yet another briefcase as the car door closes
yuri rides alone with the briefcase on his lap
most people are happy just to get out of jail
i expect to be paid to leave
yuri opens the case bales of cash
im not a fool
i know that just because they need me one day doesnt mean they wont make me a scapegoat the next
but i was back doing what i do best
the nondescript sedan melts into rush hour traffic
a checkpoint in the desert the fence a literal line in the sand
yuri accompanies a convoy of trucks
he is joking with a border officer back to doing what he loves
the border officer inspects the crates in a truck reads the manifest marked umbrellas qty units
skeptical umbrellas to saudi arabia
yuri hands the officer a plain brown paper bag
the officer looks inside a wad of cash
have a safe trip
the officer waves the convoy through
the desert where we first found yuri the aftermath of a battle
he speaks directly to camera once again
for someone whos never fired a gun or been in a battle i have suffered many casualties in my life
i guess thats how i survived
i never went to war
his thought is interrupted by a burst of gunfire
yuri contd especially with myself
yuri walks away through the charred munitions and black smoke
in the distance the sound of sporadic gunfire
