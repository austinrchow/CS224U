by adam resnick december early draft a man in a puffy foam rubber rhinoceros costume dancing under the bright friendly lights of a television studio
another rhino and various foam rubber animals dance behind him to the happy music
the rhino finishes his number and takes a bow
a bleacher full of kids bursts into wild applause
after the taping
the rhino lumbers down the hallway toward wardrobe
he is suddenly grabbed by two large men and dragged out through the exit into
where several thugs in overcoats emerge from the shadows and start beating him with lead pipes
one of the men pulls out a gun and shoots the rhino several times
the shots reverberate through the empty garage
its the taping of another childrens show rainbow randolph and the krinkle kids
randolph smiley a clean cut man with a happy face and yellow bow tie dances through rainbowland with the krinkle kids little people in top hats
he sings one of his signature songs friends come in all sizes
one of the main krinkle kids angelo pike dances behind him
singing friends come in all sizes thats a fact
all colors of the rainbow from mauve to blue
their names may not be different and their shoes may not match one might say grasp while the other says snatch some like to toss while others like to caaaaatch
friends come in all sizes take it from me
size never matters when you want some friendly patter from a pal who is true and can lift you when youre blue you can count on him and he can
count on yoooouuuu
big finish friends come in all sizes
sugar rainbows cereal plastic toys lined up on store shelves kids playing with randolph dolls kids eating rainbow potato chips and rainbow candies
a rainbow burster a kind of gun that shoots plastic rainbows
marquees announcing upcoming live appearances etc
we get the picture
rainbow randolph is the king of the kid shows
a suburban looking husband and wife enter
they find rainbow randolph sitting alone drinking a scotch
hair slicked back sans bow tie the friendly face no longer looks so friendly
he nods for them to sit down
after a nervous beat the husband puts a briefcase on the table and slides it to randolph
randolph takes a gulp of his scotch
he unsnaps the briefcase and opens it
five grand stares him in the face
youll make sure my boy dances up front right
where hell get the most camera time
randolph slams the briefcase shut startling the couple
you want your kid on the show
yes very much
then dont tell me how to run my fucking business
no no we were just randolph rises
he takes a final gulp of his scotch and picks up the briefcase
ill call you if a spot opens up
he starts to walk off
suddenly the husband and wife jump up from the table holding guns
freeze you cocksucker
drop the briefcase
federal agents storm into the bar and surround randolph
bundles of the morning editions are tossed onto the curb from passing trucks
the various headlines blare the rainbow randolph krinkle kid set is being dismantled
backdrops are rolled up and the giant rainbow centerpiece is wheeled off
workers with push brooms sweep up tons of glittery magic rainbow dust
we are tight on the sweating face of a man who looks like hes about to be executed
is standing at the end of a long conference table as the network brass glares at him
addressing the brass gentlemen let me be the first to say in all sobriety that im as shocked and outraged as all of the network ceo a hog of a
man cuts him off
save it for the papers stokes
weve got nervous sponsors and an angry public a combination uglier than two monkeys fucking
what are you doing about it
well sir im currently in the process of compiling a list of viable replacements and its my hope
with background checks
i assure you mr
stokes this network cannot survive another rainbow randolph
the goddamn p
department looks like the jim jones camp
another executive chimes in
remember stokes this was your dog that crapped on our rug
we trusted you frank
and now were in a tight spot
we have to post our quarterly earnings next month for christs sake
whoever takes that slot has to be a straight arrow
clean as a whistle
someone wholl take the heat off
one of those sweater types
any chance of luring fred rogers away from p
yeah if we back up the brinks truck
the idea now is to stop the hemorrhaging
you better fix this stokes
get us a white bread replacement fast
bland milk toast
not a speck of controversy
a giant hand slams on the table
all heads snap
the ceo drags his fingers along the shiny mahogany
calm and measured squeaky fucking clean
stokes sits behind his mahogany desk sipping a glass of wine as he goes over potential randolph replacements with nora bishop his pretty protege
bumble bee billy
reading from a list wife beater
square dance danny
still appealing the mail fraud thing
skippy black and the tippy trolls
black was deported and the trolls
well who gives a shit
nora kicks the table in frustration
this is impossible
if i ever see that rainbow randolph again ill strangle him
choke the life out of him
squeeze his scrawny neck until his eyes pop out of his skull and bounce off the walls
before indulging such cheery fantasies lets just concentrate on saving my job
stokes flips through a thick stack of files
he suddenly stops at one
whats going on with sheldon mopes these days
oh my god
have we sunk to that level already
smoochy the rhino
what a sap
saps just the pill we need right now
mopes is a straight arrow
always has been
the guy cant get arrested frank
he cant even break into the birthday party circuit
last i heard he was working hospitals and nursing homes
hes a joke
stokes stands up and walks around the room
the truth of the matter is a successful childrens show has always depended on two simple elements a fuzzy costume and a lot of hype
strip away the foam rubber and the network money and theyre all jokes
off broadway runoff
i probably have ten acts in my development file acts ive been cultivating that are more deserving than sheldon mopes
and each one a moral question mark
something i cant risk at the moment
frustrated we can do better than this guy frank
he brings nothing to the table
with mopes theres never been a whiff of controversy
the mans an ethical harmless cornball
in short a glass of milk on two legs
stokes stops pacing
dont ask me to do it
you know ill do anything for you but please
stokes gazes out the window at the city
go find smoochy
the lighted ferris wheel spins center frame
we crane down and eventually land on a side street with the amusement park looming in the b
were in front of a small building
the half lit neon sign reads coney island methadone center
we drift through the double doors through the reception area where random junkies loiter and fill out paperwork
we continue down a narrow hallway as the faint sound of someone singing and playing the guitar increases
we finally burst through another set of doors marked treatment room
the singing now fills our ears as we push in on the performer a big puffy orange rhinoceros
or to be more specific sheldon mopes
smoochy sits on a stool with his guitar and sings to the patients as they stand in line before a sliding glass window where a nurse hands each person a
little cup of methadone which they immediately drink
the smoochy costume is a mass of misshapen orange foam rubber that exposes sheldons painted face in the front
a multi colored horn protrudes from his forehead
singing to the tune of shell be comin round the mountain well get that monkey off your back yes we will yes we will well get that monkey off your
back yes we will
well get that monkey off your back and get your life right back on track if youll just give up the smack yes you will yes you will
the song ends
a few baffled junkies applaud
im rooting for you
we pan away from sheldon to the exit
standing there in her coat looking mortified is nora
nora sits in the reception area
sheldon emerges in his street clothes
he carries smoochys body on a hanger over his shoulder and carries a large shopping bag which holds smoochys head
i uh saw your performance tonight
i wouldve done a longer set if that guy hadnt pulled a knife on the security guard
once the pepper spray starts flyin thats it for the encores
yes that did put a damper on the evening didnt it
are you a new patient
on the juice as we say
but its sweet of you to assume so
she hands him her card
he reads it
to nora good gravy
you work for kidnet
sheldon grabs her hand and shakes it
well its a pleasure to meet you nora
a real honor
hey you hungry
sheldon and nora stand at the crowded counter at nathans
sheldon ravenously eats his sloppily garnished oddly colored hot dog
nora winces as she watches him
with full mouth soy dogs
never thought id live to see the day
organic rich in natural protein and nobody gets killed
although i do feel bad for the beans
sure you dont want one
believe it or not no
he takes another bite
so anyway like i was saying people always tell me you gotta network sheldon
you gotta sell yourself
or youll be playing the drug clinics and shopping centers the rest of your life
and you know what i tell em
i havent the foggiest
i tell em its not about the old handshake and back slap game
its not about adding fuel to the shlock machine
its about doing good work
making people happy and delivering a positive message
foundations are built with concrete not plaster of paris
he pulls the stained misshapen smoochy head from the shopping bag
this is concrete
this is integrity
calmly i can see that
sheldon realizes his voice was getting too loud
as you can imagine living by your convictions can be a little stressful at times
we all have our cross to bear
see i was raised by my grandfather and grandpop paved driveways for a living
are we going into a story
thing is he didnt really pave them
just covered them with black paint
of course once the first rain came along people realized theyd been swindled
i vowed to myself back then that id never make a living through deception
whadda ya think of them apples
nora looks glassy eyed
she takes a deep breath
the reason im here today mr
mopes as fate would have it kidnet is currently looking for a performer with
she almost chokes on the word
got any more jokes
i dont think i could top that one
hold the phone
youre telling me that kidnet is finally ready to do a show of smoochy quality
of smoochy caliber
i believe were ready to push ourselves to that level
i knew this day would come
after all these years i finally meet someone in the business who gets what i do
who gets what im all about
you get me dont you nora
im afraid so
well miss v
lets go make history
kidnet studio wardrobe room
a team of designers and seamstresses cut sew and shape endless sheets of orange foam rubber
sheldon stands on a wooden box as hes measured from head to toe
on the wall is a blueprint labeled smoochy the rhino redesign
a costume designer walks over with the new smoochy head and places it on sheldon
as seamstresses fit him with the new smoochy costume various signs and billboards float through the frame trumpeting copy like its almost smoochy time
sets props and camera equipment are rolled into the studio
through a series of dissolves we see the smoochyland magic jungle take shape
a choreographer maps out a number for smoochy and the rhinettes
the rhinettes are the former krinkle kid little people with horns strapped to their foreheads
nora and stokes watch from the wings with a mixture of uncertainty and disgust
a seamstress zips up the back of the finished redesigned smoochy costume
sheldon stands proudly before the design team
smoochy is now television ready smoothed out more colorful less lumpy and exuding sunshiny happiness
smoochy is about to enter with the rhinettes
angelo a former krinkle kid stands beside him
angelo you were always my favorite krinkle kid
the way youd click your heels during the jellybean jam
im honored to have you as a rhinette
a jobs a job
suddenly lights up in all its multi colored smoochyland glory
the bleachers are full of children
whos your favorite rhino
the kids in the bleachers all scream in unison
smoochy bounds out on stage followed by the rhinettes who form a dancing circle around him
its gonna be a fantabulous day in smoochyland
the kids cheer as smoochy and the rhinettes featuring angelo pike go into their its a fantabulous day in smoochyland number a catchy bouncy song and dance routine that plays
out in the sugar coated jungle of smoochyland
its a fantabulous day in smoochy land lets have a great big cheer for the smoochy land band well dance with our jungle pals wont that be grand oh its
a fantabulous day in smoochy land
smoochy dances right up to the camera filling the frame with his friendly puffy face
end of prep montage
a disheveled randolph paces on a deserted dock
the brooklyn bridge looms in the b
a car pulls up in the b
stokes gets out
randolph moves under an awning
i was starting to think that maybe you werent coming
i agreed to meet you didnt i
i had a dinner engagement
randolph takes a swig from a flask
you know i used to have dinner engagements
sometimes four five a night
i was the toast of the fucking town
dont start randolph
voice rising cars boats whores and horses i had em all
when i walked into a restaurant ten guys reached for my hat
when i stood up to take a piss they cleared the rest room
id walk down the street and traffic stopped mouths gaped
you know why
you know why frank
now shouting i was rainbow fucking randolph
are you through
youre in a hurry
you dont have time for me
the guy who earned for you
the guy who put those fucking suits on your back and the pheasant au vin in your brooklyn mouth
i think its fair to say we helped each other
randolph suddenly breaks down
pleading you gotta fix it frank
you gotta get me my slot back
he now clings to stokes lapels
how can i sit around while that rhinoceros
that horned carpetbagger gets a free ride on my dime
you and i have history frank
stokes pries randolphs hands from his overcoat
theres nothing i can do for you
youre a pariah
i cant even be seen with you
dont do this to me frank
im in deep deep shit
they kicked me out of the corporate penthouse
i got bookies breathing down my neck
dont you hear what im saying
im not gonna make it
the clocks ticking
put yourself in my shoes for christs sake
the ugly truth is your shoes have become my shoes
as long as the rhinos on the air everythings by the book
no skim no percentage
the network wanted squeaky clean and they got it
and believe me mopes is sparkling
he looks randolph squarely in the eye
youre totally broke
you dont have a dime left to your name
thats what im trying to tell you
randolph looks at him hopefully as stokes straightens his tie
dont contact me again randy
stokes walks off
randolph watches him disappear through the mist
youll get yours frank
the rhino too
do you hear me
the wheels are turning
stokes is gone
randolph takes a swig from his flask and wipes his chin with his sleeve
he stares out at the river
quietly to himself sooner or later even a guy whos squeaky clean falls into mud
of the docks as randolph stands alone before the river
as it erratically limps forward before dropping out of the wind up smoochy lays upside down on the carpet next to noras desk legs grinding lamely in the air
various smoochy items are spread out on her desk top
a restless looking sheldon and a few members of noras staff are in on the meeting
again these are just prototypes
ive been assured by funzone that all the bugs will be worked out before christmas
sheldon raises his hand
nora ignores him and looks at her watch
okay so lets recap before we break up
refers to notes yes to the smoochy ice pops
no to the smoochy string cheese
and were in a dick measuring contest with brown brown over the shampoo split
sheldon suddenly stands up
okay time out people
if i may interject i think were putting the cart before the horse here
nora throws him an icy look
smoochys still earning the trust of the kids
we dont want to compromise that by asking them to buy shampoo and cheese
how bout we just concentrate on doing the best show possible
without all the bells and whistles and rickata rackita
what do you say guys
nora casually picks up a smoochy frisbee from her desk and sails it toward the open door
it lands in the hallway
monotone oh damn
no problem ill get it
he walks out to the hallway
to staffer shut the door please john
john shuts the door
now lock it
he locks it
nora emerges from the revolving door of the kidnet building which is located in the heart of times square and heads down broadway
sheldon emerges from the building
hey nora wait up
she keeps walking
sheldon catches up and walks alongside her occasionally getting jostled by passersby
good meeting today
i thought we tackled some hot issues
although ill be honest there were a few times that i felt my voice wasnt being heard
i think thats a conservative estimate
i just want the show to have some weight you know
silly songs sure but with a message
pop quiz how many original compositions are in the smoochy songbook
do you sense my complete lack of interest
try two thousand
covering every topic from how yummy vegetables are to the importance of donating plasma
dont you get it nora
im a valuable resource
she looks sheldon in the eye for the first time
can i make this real easy for you
the only reason youre on tv right now is because rainbow randolph is a degenerate scumbag
i didnt discover you i delivered you
like a bag of groceries
i have a bigger emotional investment in my nail polish
so dont peddle your sap to me rhino
your job is just to smile and nod your head
she walks off
sheldon sits at the bar in the restaurant nursing a drink and talking to the bartender
he seems slightly drunk
no no you misunderstand me
its not that im literally comparing captain kangaroo to jesus christ
im just saying that the captain like christ was someone you could believe in
those guys didnt care about bells and whistles and rickita rackata
it was all about the work
forget about it
the bartender nods and starts to pour sheldon another drink
waving him off thats okay my good man
threes my limit
i never saw anyone get loaded on orange juice before
back in my college days i could put away a carton of the stuff
a sharply dressed man burke bennett sits down next to sheldon
to bartender gimme a five crown
the bartender nods
he looks over at sheldon
smoochy the rhino
im a big fan
flattered gee thanks
i usually dont get recognized without my horn
burke extends his hand
i represent kid show talent
sheldon and burke now sit at a corner table
look shel frank strokes aint in the business to make you rich
hes in it to make frank stokes rich
thats how these network goons operate
thats so sad
is it just me or is that sad
you know years ago a client of mine dicky gimble was having a problem
wow you represented dicky gimble
yeah before the asshole found religion
anyway stokes was trying to screw my boy out of some merchandising points
claimed he had a warehouse full of dicky dolls that werent moving
now frank and i are old friends so i say to him okay cock show me the warehouse see i know the fucking warehouse is in the bronx and i
know its emptier than my wifes head
chuckles to make a long story short i walk out with a check for a hundred grand and stokes is sitting there with his thumb up his ass
thats very amusing but i dont care about smoochy dolls and smoochy floor wax
i just want more creative input
this rhino came from my womb
i bore him i nursed him and dammit
he pounds his fist on the table
i should be the one who raises him
shel its all about the dough
after you get the money you get the power
and after you get the power you can have smoochy walk on stage with a hard on if you want
its funny that never crossed my mind
burke downs the rest of his drink and stands up
unfortunately until then
youre just another puppet in the prop room
he hands sheldon his card
give me a call when youre ready kid
ill cut the strings and open the magic door for you
randolph peers through the restaurants front window
he shivers from the cold as he watches sheldon and burke shake hands
burke heads for the exit
randolph quickly ducks into the shadows
a moment later burke exits the club and walks down the street
randolph pops out
i saw you
i saw you in there
at my table
talking to him
yeah so what do you want
youre my agent
or did you forget that
not anymore pal
youre a cigarette butt
go lay in the gutter
burke walks off
in the litter strewn alley we pan across several grocery bags broken egg shells flour bags butter wrappers mixing bowls and other baking ingredients
the pan ends on randolph who stands over a barrel fire holding a spatula
a cookie sheet rests on the barrel
randolph removes the cookie sheet and gazes at it gleefully
we now see that the cookies are phallic shaped
a perfect batch of cock cookies for a very special rhino
he sets the tray aside
oh yes youre going to learn about shame my dear smoochy
and im your professor
its thirty minutes before a smoochy taping
dozens of giddy children are led into the studio where they take seats on the bleachers
sheldon in the smoochy costume sans head lumbers up to nora
he holds a rundown for that days show
excuse me nora
why was the please and thank you song cut
because its sappy and it takes away from the cookie song
it enhances it
the cookie song is a meaningless piece of fluff without the please and thank you coda
thats the moral anchor
thats where the lesson is
you cant sell the sizzle without the steak
and i want the cookie song lyrics changed back to the way they were originally scripted
i cant do that
i will not condone children consuming endless amounts of refined sugar
i have to look myself in the mirror every morning
this is network television not a sprout farm
were here to sell sugar and plastic
thats what keeps the lights on
youre treating me like a puppet
you know that
well guess what
i am not your puppet
now get your spongy orange ass out there and dance for the cameras
an angry sheldon storms off in frustration but then stops
he looks back at her
we have different eyes nora
when i go out there i see kids
you see wallets with pigtails
he moves on
nora stares at him as he walks away
he obviously got to her
as sheldon heads toward the studio he doesnt notice the two beady eyes staring at him from under the stairwell
after a beat randolph emerges and slinks backstage
hes clutching a duffle bag
randolph sneaks into the prop room and shuts the door
he scurries over to the prop shelf and locates smoochys multicolored magic cookie bag
he opens it and tosses the cookies into the trash can
reaching into his pockets he pulls out his special homemade cookies
he chuckles as he dumps them into the magic cookie bag
bon soir la smoochy
welcome to fatty arbuckle land
he cackles to himself
he then notices a box in the corner of the room
scribbled in magic marker on the side are the words rainbow randolph crap
he walks over and pulls the box out
he slowly opens the flaps
inside is his old costume
he pulls it out and clutches it lovingly
he smells it
the echoey sound of his theme song comes flooding back to him for a moment along with the sound of children laughing
softly to himself dont worry little ones
rainbow randolph will return
with rising anger after these messages
he holds up smoochys magic cookie bag
he then stuffs his old costume into his duffle bag
the smoochy show is in the middle of a taping
the smoochyland band is playing a fast jazzy number doin the jiggy ziggy as smoochy the rhinettes and several kids dance frenetically
the kids in the bleachers are in hysterics as smoochy shakes his body spastically
the song finally ends
the kids in the bleachers jump to their feet cheering and applauding
boy all that jiggyin and ziggyin sure makes a fella hungry
now if only i had my super duper super secret super special
the kids in the bleachers erupt in unison magic cookie bag
right o riffic
looks skyward magic cookie bag i command thee
come to your lord and master
the lights dim as the smoochyland band plays the theme
smoochys magic cookie bag is lowered from the ceiling by a filament wire
the kids go crazy
singing lookie lookie lookie here comes the cookies
fresh and organic no need to panic
right from the soil no tropical oils
sweetened with juice for an energy boost
fiber galore youll be askin for more
she looks pissed but then looks over at the kids in the bleachers
their faces are filled with laughter
for the first time she feels the connection smoochy has with them
he peers out from his hiding place backstage
his eyes widen with delight as the magic cookie bag continues its descent
the cookie bag finally reaches smoochy
he holds the bag high above his head in a religious ceremonial fashion as the rhinettes and the kids crowd around him
just the smell of unprocessed flour makes my tummy do somersaults
under his breath whatever that means you fucking retard
his puffy orange hand reaches for the bags clasp as the music reaches its crescendo
hes practically shaking as he suppresses an insane laugh
give em a cookie
give em a cookie
he reaches into the bag and with a grand flourish pulls out a flaming red penis cookie
the cookie is somewhat misshapen and not perfectly formed
smoochy gets a big grin
look at this cookie kids
a rocket ship
the kids ooh and ahh
he looks confused
what a special day with such special cookies
smoochy pretends to zoom the penis cookie through the air
look at me kids
im flying to the moon
im flying to mars
im flying to randolph whose face is now bright red cant take it anymore
he runs onto the stage
he grabs the rocket cookie from smoochy
are you fucking blind
its a cock
not a space ship
three burly kidnet security guards drag randolph down the stairwell
they beat the shit out of him and toss him through the exit door
the headline reads rainbow randolph interrupts smoochy taping
the subhead reads runs onstage shouting penis related obscenities
burke sits on the couch next to sheldon reading the paper
he shakes his head in disgust
nora sits in a chair near stokes
thank you all for coming
i just wanted to iron out a few wrinkles i feel were having in the communication department
no finger pointing
lord knows when you start pointing fingers someone gets poked in the eye
stokes and nora sit stone faced
anyhoo id like to turn the floor over to my new agent mr
as you can imagine my client has many concerns not the least of which is studio security but we can address that later
he pats sheldons head like a dog
see this guy frank
take a good long look cause this prick saved your life
without him youd be sitting in kaplans right now sucking club soda through a paper straw
to nora and you youd be organizing puppet shows for the brats at p
excuse me honey
theres no excuse for you
man i love club soda
sheldon laughs trying to lighten the mood
burke gives him an affectionate slap
weve always managed to come to some sort of arrangement burke
why the fireworks
cause im holding all the gunpowder
i represent the man who created owns and controls every square inch of smoochy the rhino
burke pours himself a drink from stokes private bar
god created adam and what did he get
a fucking dud
he breathed life into a winner
and anyone who does a better job than god is gonna have a price
burke of course is in no way comparing me to god
yes i am
you seem to forget that we went out and found your guy
dug up his corpse
handed him his own show when he couldnt sell his face to a photo booth
to be fair nora i was booked to open a car wash in montauk
oh so you were doing him a favor
chuckles allow me to untangle this web of shit
i dont care what his resume was i dont care where you found him i dont care if his last job was juggling apples for a hut full of pygmies
on the outskirts of the congo
the fact is he fits a bill and you need him
like a hungry baby needs a big tit
and that my friends is why youre in a box with no ventilation
and that is why the rhino is going to get what he deserves
what is that exactly
burke walks over to stokes desk and leans across it
hes an inch from stokes face
heaven hell and everything in between
being popped as foamy champagne runs down the bottle
sheldon and burke sit at a table in the nightclub
burke raises his glass
to the star and new executive producer of the smoochy show
may your reign be a long and healthy one
they clink glasses
im still in shock
complete creative control part ownership of the show discretion over merchandising and a dressing room with a toilet
am i dreaming or what
and dont forget the corporate penthouse
it took me six years to get that for randolph
me living in a penthouse
whod a thunk it
its called the high life kid
get used to it
pretty soon youll be burnin one hundred dollar bills just to see franklin break a sweat
jeez i hope not
i have a deep respect for money
not to mention ben franklin who had some remarkable achievements in his lifetime
burke pulls out a paper bag and hands it to sheldon
thats your graduation present
something youre gonna need now
sheldon reaches in the bag and pulls out a revolver
he recoils in horror and immediately drops it back in the bag
think of it as a tool of the trade
ive never owned a gun ive never touched a gun and i dont believe in guns
when i played cowboys and indians as a kid i was always the chinese railroad worker
trust me shel
its a handy accessory in this business
even if you dont load it have it for show
sometimes thats all you need
especially with a creep like randolph lurking around
burke and sheldon look up and notice the hulking grinning figure of spinner dunn standing over them
spinner has the smile of a little boy despite his crooked nose and scarred face
he extends his hand
im so excited to meet you
spinners massive hand engulfs sheldons
i saw you fight on tv once
i think it was your farewell bout
through a series of cuts we see spinner getting pummeled in various fights
tonight marks spinner dunns final appearance in the ring
what a pleasure its been to watch him proudly march into the record books for taking more blows to the head than any fighter in history
a bloodied defeated spinner happily holds up the arm of his opponent after a match
he then hugs the referee
he jumps down from the ring and hugs the three judges
scrambled a bit
you dont retire with a record of and wind up the governor
but on the upside hes got the disposition of a collie
spinner wades into the stands and starts hugging the spectators
spinner is still pumping sheldons hand
you know what i love smoochy
i love when you do the jiggy ziggy dance
you know the one you do during silly time
thats a big one
wanna see me do it
well i dont know why if theres enough room here to
spinner starts jiggying and ziggying for sheldon
he bangs into a table and knocks over someones drink
okay champ dont get overheated
spinner stops out of breath
he leans over and hugs sheldon
i love you
love you too spinner
a powerful looking woman tommy cotter calls to spinner from the bar
spinner come over and meet the senator
spinner dutifully hurries over to tommy
he seems pretty popular
it must take real talent to run a place like this
the guy couldnt run a water faucet
hes just a mascot
its his cousins a bunch of irish mob boys who really run the joint
he shakes the senators hand as tommy and a few other tough irish guys stand around
spinner looks over towards sheldon
loudly dont go anywhere smoochy
ill be right back after i take a dump
spinner releases the senators hand and rushes off
i think you made a new friend kid
we met him backstage with smoochy
angelo stirs a pot of soup in the worn down but tidy apartment
a rhinette costume is draped over one of the chairs
there is a sudden loud pounding on the door
angelo puts the spoon down and reaches behind some spices on the shelf above
he pulls out a revolver
the pounding continues
yeah who is it
friendly open up buddy
its me randolph
its been a long time
angelo puts the gun in his waistband and walks to the door
he slowly slides the chain off and opens the door a crack
peering in at him are the bloodshot eyes of rainbow randolph
randolph suddenly kicks the door open and tackles angelo
randolph sits on top of the little man
you fucking traitor
my bodys barely cold and already you work for the rhino
i dont know what youre talking about
dont lie to me
i heard all about it
you strapped that horn on faster than a cheerleader gets the clap
i gotta eat dont i
youre a krinkle kid
not a smooch bag
say it i am a krinkle kid
say it before god
on the soul of jesus christ
say what you are
angelo punches randolph in the mouth and flips him over
he now sits on randolph pointing the revolver to his face
im a rhinette
the krinkle kids are ten feet under
randolph starts crying like a child
blubbering i missed you so much
can i stay here
i got no place to go
angelo sighs and puts the gun away
angelo and randolph sit at the small kitchen table
angelo watches as randolph ravenously eats a bowl of soup
they kicked me out of the corporate penthouse
sons a bitches
thats how i got this beauty
he points to a nasty bump near his eye
and of course theres this
he yanks his lip back to reveal a missing tooth
that happened after my little visit to the studio the other day
he slurps another spoonful of soup and spits a bay leaf on the floor
i got liens back taxes lawyers bills threats against my life
i basically got the whole fucking world up my ass
its okay i got a loooong memory son
amos and andy dialect what dey sow dey gonna reap
he cackles insanely as he picks up a bottle of gin and takes a deep swig
he passes out and falls off the chair
angelo leans down and lifts his head off the floor
stop doing this to yourself
randolph doesnt respond
angelo slaps his face
you hear me
dont piss your life away like this
half conscious its the rhino angie
hes been sent by the devil
sent from hell to destroy me
is the face of evil
we are on the smiling goofy face of sheldon whose picture graces the front page of variety under the headline mopes to executive produce smoochy show
the subhead reads tenure to begin today
a dollar bill is slapped down over the picture
we widen out to see sheldon buying the magazine at the newsstand in front of the kidnet building
he turns and walks toward the kidnet entrance
he stops and looks up at the building
smiling he takes a deep breath and enters
sheldon whistles as he walks down the hall giving cheerful hellos and good mornings along the way
he enters noras office
nora is on the phone
she pretends not to notice him
sheldon bides his time by inspecting knickknacks examining photos on the wall etc
finally he half whispers half mouths to her whenever you get a chance
i just need a second
into the phone listen can i call you back
yeah some assholes screaming in my ear
she hangs up
im sorry you didnt have to hang up
if i didnt youd still be here
but i am still here
im hoping to correct that
nora i want us to start off on the right foot
i want you to know that i value your input and i dont want you to feel intimidated just because the power structure has changed a bit
i consider you a partner
thatll come in handy if were ever at a square dance
well i was never much of the do se do type but what i would love to do is take you out to lunch one day
you know just two colleagues chewing the fat
forming a mutual respect
planting the seeds of cooperation
if you change your mind i wont
sheldon just nods and starts to exit
okay then ill be in my office if you need me
if you want to brainstorm about anything
ideas and so forth
he passes a plant by the door
she ignores him
sheldon walks slowly down the hallway
he no longer has a bounce in his step
sheldon enters his plush new office awkwardly walks over to his new desk and sits behind it for the first time
my cousin spinners take quite a shine to you
hes surprised to tommy from spinner dunns restaurant
tommys crew roy danny jimmy and sammy occupy the sofa
ever since you came in the restaurant
he cant stop yakkin
well hes a very nice man
very sweet disposition for someone that size
so i was wondering if maybe you could give him a little floor space
you know a little part on the show
youre the executive producer now
you call the shots right
uh thats a very sweet offer and i love spinner but tv is a complicated medium and
i mean that would be like me getting into the ring with a prizefighter
laughs can you imagine such a thing
whats the alphabet mommy
sheldon laughs again
tommy gets quiet
this makes me sad
very very sad
whats wrong tommy
im just very sad right now
who made you sad tommy
i dont want to mention names
the guys look menacingly at sheldon
they rise and walk around his desk until theyre on either side of him
you know what
maybe i can find spinner a little something to do on the show
thats probably the best solution
tommy now smiles and walks over to sheldon
she musses sheldons hair
youre a good boy mopes
dont think we dont remember favors
sheldon is in a meeting with a man sonny gordon
look i appreciate the visit but im just putting together a little petting zoo segment
nothing fancy a few kittens
maybe a duck
if youre looking to bring in that many pieces i gotta put a crew together
plus were lookin at transpo a few leash handlers a cleanup boy and a doper to keep the inventory quiet
jeez this all sounds awfully elaborate
i might have to forgo the union and just borrow a few animals from a pet shop
i wouldnt recommend it
miss carol from romper room tried that once and shes still limping
a frazzled looking sheldon is meeting with ben franks
on behalf of funzone toys id like to congratulate you on your recent promotion and present you with a small gift
ben reaches into his breast pocket and drops a large wad of money on sheldons desk that lands with a thud
thats nice of you ben but a card would have been fine
funzone toys would very much like the smoochy contract mr
are you offering me a bribe or something
funzone toys would very much like the smoochy contract mr
sheldon picks up the money and tosses it back to ben
sheldon rises from his desk
normally sir we take the trash out at the end of the day but i think ill make an exception in your case
sheldon escorts ben out the door and slams it shut
the phone rings
sheldon walks over and picks it up
feedlepepper on line two
he says hes an old friend
sheldon punches line two
you better grow eyes on the back of your fucking head you horned piece of shit
i wont sleep until the worms are crawlin up your foam rubber ass
im going on safari motherfucker
sheldon hangs up stunned
nora walks in holding the daily news
congratulations on your little ice show
what are you talking about
it didnt take you long to sell out did it
she tosses the paper on his desk
what happened to your precious integrity
or was that just part of your dog and pony act
a confused sheldon looks at the around town column
garden to host smoochy on ice
the subhead reads
we are tight on the feet of an irish dancer doing a sort of riverdance
we widen out and the rest of the dancers come into frame
spinner and the mob ar clapping and whooping
sheldon and burke sit at a table in the dark club having a conversation
burke i never agreed to do an ice show
shel do you know what kind of cash well take in between the gate and concessions
a venture like this gets you money and muscle
ice shows represent everything im against
theyre mindless spectacles whose main purpose is to sell overpriced sugar water and cheap plastic toys that splinter in a kids mouth on the ride home
look i know you got this fetish for ethics but nows not the time to fly that kite
no ones ever refused a shot at an ice show
sheldon tears the contract in half
smoochy doesnt sell out burke
you should be proud of that
proud that you represent a client who paves driveways not paints them over
im thrilled shel
burke just sits there stunned
a waitress sandy passes by the booth
ill have a pineapple juice sandy
what happened to orange juice
im feeling feisty tonight
we are now on a drum solo
ernie the elephant of the smoochyland band works it
the animal band plays a sloppy version of pop goes the weasel
end on spinner dunn the newest and by far largest member of the band
spinner holds s cowbell and seems to be concentrating intently on the proper moment to hit it
unfortunately his rhythm is off which throws the rest of the band off as well
we widen out to see smoochy and the rhinettes attempting to dance to the off kilter rhythm
the song finally ends
the rhinettes glare at spinner
smoochy addresses the camera
boy wasnt that fun
in an awkward kind of way
anyhoo how bout a big round of applause for the newest member of the smoochyland band
former heavyweight contender spinner dunn
spinner stands up to take a bow and almost knocks the entire bandstand over
there is a smattering of confused applause from the kids in the bleachers
spinner drops the cowbell and it clangs on the studio floor
a beaming spinner runs up to sheldon whos still in costume
did i do good sheldon huh
did i do good
yeah that was great spinner
just watch your elbow next time
pinkys probably gonna lose that tooth
im gonna go get drunk now
spinner skips off humming pop goes the weasel and banging his cowbell
nora passes sheldon backstage
casting the show with mental patients i like that
snapping he is not a mental patient
hes an ex boxer and nightclub owner who happens to have the sweet innocent brian of a five year old
excuse me for not making the distinction
sheldon exits the kidnet building and walks to the curb to hail a cab
a friendly looking man in a suit and bow tie approaches him
this is merv green
a limo pulls up in front of them
merv opens the back door
thanks anyway but im going uptown
merv pulls his jacket back to reveal a revolver tucked in his waistband
humor me rhino
sheldon slides into the back seat of the limo
a big thug in an overcoat henry is already sitting there
merv gets in behind him and shuts the door
sheldon is now wedged between the two men as the limo heads down broadway
merv extends his hand
merv green sheldon
its a pleasure to meet you
if youre hoping for an autograph the guns a bit much
the whole catch more flies with honey thing it really holds water
sheldon laughs nervously
sheldon i represent the parade of hope foundation
maybe youve heard of us
you raise money to build childrens hospitals right
weve been known to add a brick or two sure
merv and the thug laugh
sheldon let me get right to the point theres talk on the street that youre pulling out of the ice show
is that true
big sigh you know i never agreed to an ice show nor would i ever agree to do an ice show and let me add that none of this is
your concern sir
shakes his head sheesh
listen carefully son parade of hope has sponsored every kidnet ice show since
we take a piece off the top and everybody walks away happy
so lets not buck history
well i appreciate the offer but for the gazillionth time im not doing an ice show so we have nothing to discuss
now if youll just pull over ill get out and well say our toodley dos
to driver far corner please
allow me to be less murky
starting tomorrow smoochy the rhino raises his baton for parade of hope
benefits banquets fund raisers i want it all
to driver pull over terry
the car pulls to the curb
and as far as the ice show goes
i recommend you start shopping for skates
the door pops open and sheldon is tossed out
a troubled looking sheldon stands on his balcony looking out at the city
he drinks orange juice straight from the carton
sheldon is on the phone with burke
this is unacceptable burke
im calling the authorities
dont do it shel
you rat on parade of hope and youll be lucky if they find your toenails
these guys are the roughest of all the charities
i was threatened by an organization thats supposed to help children
what kind of world is this
the real one
consider the ice show and stay healthy
burke hangs up
after a beat sheldons doorbell rings
he walks over to the door and opens it
to his surprise nora is standing there
may i come in
she seems a little wobbly
sheldon notices shes holding a pint of whiskey
are you okay
im getting drunk and im not used to it
well not to make you feel worse but with alcohol youre also consuming empty calories
nora looks at him for a moment
its just that
i want to apologize actually
and on those rare occasions when i feel the need to apologize for something it helps if im you know
nora trips slightly
sheldon takes the whiskey from her
why dont we get some air
he leads her out on the balcony
they look out at the city
i may have been a little harsh when we spoke the other day
a little out of line
well it wasnt as bad as the week before when you called me a pasty faced no talent hack
yes that was probably insensitive as well
looks at him i heard youre not doing the ice show
i find that
why didnt you tell me
i guess i didnt want to spoil your fun
you look so content when youre berating me
nora looks down
im afraid i have become a bit hardened over the years
sinceritys an easy disguise in this business
its hard to know whos on the level
believe me im learning that more and more every day
wistfully sometimes light is really dark sometimes crows can sing like larks sometimes winter feels like spring dont think you know everything
in disbelief rickets the hippo
you remember rickets
that was my favorite show when i was a kid
rickets was the one face i knew i could trust
thats how i felt
rickets had real depth
he was my inspiration for smoochy
he was my inspiration to work in childrens television
i cant believe it
i never met anyone who even remembers rickets
do you remember the klunky wunky dance
i did it at my first communion
sheldon starts doing the rather insane looking klunky wunky dance
nora does it with him
they both stop and look at each other
sheldon impulsively leans in and kisses her
that was a mistake right
i didnt mean for that to hap nora grabs his head and pulls it toward her
they begin kissing passionately
as they kiss youre not full of shit like all the others are you
as they kiss youre for real right
through the kisses i mean i couldnt tell
first i thought it was an act
and then i just thought you were a simp or something
you dont have to explain
they continue to kiss
nora abruptly stops
i should go
nora exits the balcony and collects her coat and purse
is it the whiskey
if you have to throw up be my guest
anywhere you like
its just getting late
sheldon follows her to the door
she stops and looks at him for a moment
the phone starts to ring
neither of them says anything for a beat
better get that
sheldon shuts the door and sighs
he goes to the bar to pour himself another orange juice before picking up the phone
we go to a horizontal split screen
randolph is on the bottom half
he lies on his bed in angelos apartment wearing a bathrobe with a towel wrapped around his head
his head dangles off the bed as he talks on the phone
the shot is reminiscent of bye bye birdie
my name is benjamin kunklepeck and im calling on behalf of parents for decency in childrens television perhaps youve heard of us
no but i like where youre coming from
its an issue very close to my heart
why just yesterday i was commenting sir were having a banquet tomorrow and wed be honored to have you perform for us
we would also like to present you with a plaque for your ongoing commitment to childrens television
the presenter will be a young orphan with mild asthma
can you attend
a black lincoln town car travels across the bridge toward staten island
thanks for picking me up mr
its very nice of you
sheldon is in the back seat
the smoochy costume is next to him
behind the wheel is randolph
hes in disguise
dont be silly
the chance to have smoochy the rhino perform at our little soiree
id carry you piggy back through a bed of hot rusty glass if i had to
well its always a pleasure to help out a worthy cause
and believe me ive learned lately that its not all sunshine and daffodils in the land of non profit
i just looove your show by the way
its such a refreshing change of pace from that dreadful embezzler
whats his name again
rainbow something or other
what a scoundrel
hes probably gay too
oh i dont know
i feel sorry for him actually
he obviously has problems or issues that he needs to sort out
getting frustrated yeah yeah yeah but dont you take particular glee in that you basically stole his time slot
helped shovel dirt onto his miserable corpse as it were
no i would never take pleasure in someones downfall
you know the old expression about walking a mile in another mans shoes
well that really holds water
just try to imagine
snapping come on hes a fucking asshole
you hate him
can we listen to the radio
the town car is parked behind an old warehouse in the middle of nowhere
sheldon is now in costume
randolph rushes out of the door very excited
okay theyre ready for you
i gotta say this is a first i never performed in a tractor parts warehouse before
well we like to do these things no frills
its all about the kids
amen to that
randolph opens the door a crack and listens
we hear an o
voice from inside
it gives me great pleasure to introduce our very special guest
a supporter of the cause and a friend to the brotherhood
please welcome the one the only
smoochy the rhino
we hear applause
randolph quickly opens the rusty door
knock em dead kid
he shoves sheldon inside
sheldon runs in and immediately starts singing and dancing on the makeshift stage
well how do you do my good friends
how do you do my pals
its so nice to see good friends
sing along with me now
how do you do my good sheldon abruptly stops singing as a look of shock comes over him
push in on his troubled face
several hundred men in nazi uniforms in a warehouse draped in swastikas
they all start chanting heil smoochy
a huge swastika banner unfurls behind smoochy framing him like patton in front of the american flag
flashbulbs go off
the heil smoochys continue
a german march starts to blare from the speakers
looking stunned sheldon slowly leans into the mic
he clears his throat
the music stops
everyone quiets down
he searches for just the right words and finally
its my sincere hope that im dreaming right now but in the event that im not
whats the deal with the swastikas
suddenly a sea of policemen bursts into the warehouse
this is an unlawful assembly you kraut sons a bitches
youre all under arrest
pandemonium ensues us all the nazis run for cover
sheldon stands in the middle of it all unsure what to do
sheldon is led from the warehouse in handcuffs and is barraged with questions from waiting reporters
flashbulbs go off as they shout out questions
are you officially a member of the aryan brotherhood sheldon
is it true you consider adolph hitler your personal hero
do you think associating with neo nazis might adversely affect your career
how does it feel to be a hate filled racist scumbag
this is a mix up
i dont hate anyone
does that mean you dont hate nazis
i didnt say that
i sheldon is shoved into the back seat of a squad car
it drives off sirens blaring
the squad car drives through times square
the headlines on the zipper marquee glide through the frame smoochy the rhino arrested at nazi rally
cops raid warehouse during rhinos performance
aryan brotherhood declares smoochy one of us
president condemns smoochy the fascist
sheldon stares out the window as the dark city passes by
we slowly move in on his eyes as we
in slow motion smoochy dances in the studio while holding a delighted little girl in his arms
sheldon is fingerprinted and photographed
stock footage of a wild rhinoceros being shot by hunters
smoochys magic jungle is dismantled
a young sheldon helps his grandfather spread black paint on a driveway
the smoochy billboard is torn down
the smoochy costume is in flames
it slowly burns to ashes
the kidnet ceo stands before a cluster of reporters and network cameras
we can see the times square zipper marquee through the glass doors behind him
headlines read congressional committee probes nazi ties to kid biz
smoochy photos removed from city elementary schools
jewish groups plan day of outrage
rhino in bronx zoo pelted with eggs
here at kidnet smoochy the rhino is now smoochy the ghost
we have excised that particular malignancy from our network and will seek out a suitable replacement
until then the smoochy slot will be safely occupied by popeye cartoons
the reporters furiously scribble down his statement
randolph dances down the street like gene kelly
he whistles a happy tune and tips his hat to everyone who walks by
as he dances along he pets a dog
hi there poochy
coos at a baby in a stroller
well arent you the cutest little boo boo in the world
and grabs a rose from a flower vendor before handing it to an old lady
for you my dear
may you live to be a hundred
he continues to dance onward waving back at everyone
unfortunately he doesnt realize hes heading straight for a light pole and slams into it with a sickening smack
nora exits the revolving door of the kidnet building and heads down broadway
sheldon pops out from a store front
hes wearing a knit cap and sunglasses to disguise himself
i have to talk to you
nora keeps walking
we have nothing to talk about
dont tell me you believe what theyre saying
i dont have to believe anyone
the picture in the paper said it all
no one forced you to perform at that rally
i barely sang one song
well maybe next time youll do a longer set
nora i had no idea that was a nazi function
funny youd think the fifty foot swastika you were standing in front of mightve given you a hint
the papers are blowing that out of proportion
it was nowhere near that big
nora stops and looks sheldon in the eye
look the fact of the matter is i dont know you okay
so dont expect me to go out on an emotional limb here
sheldon looks crushed
but what about the balcony
what about the klunky wunky dance
i was drunk
dont read too much into it
she looks at him for a moment and then walks off
a disheveled and unshaven sheldon wanders the streets looking dazed
hes stuffing a cupcake into his mouth and swigging from a bottle of root beer
he passes a construction site and notices some graffiti on a wall a crudely drawn goose stepping smoochy in a nazi uniform and hitler moustache
sheldon keeps walking
he descends the subway stairs at nd street
sheldon comes up from the subway
we see the cyclone from astroland in the b
sheldon stands in front of the methadone clinic he used to perform at
its boarded up
he just stares at it
an old vagrant walks up to him
if youre lookin to get a cup of juice the wells dried up son
city shut her down
bastardsll put a new pair of tits on the statue of liberty but they wont help a poor hophead
the vagrant shakes his head sadly
just once i wish i had a little clout
id set things straight in this town believe me
sighs hell of a world
he walks off
to himself hell of a world
on a large screen tv the smiling asian face of takashi yamashita whos singing cole porters i get a kick out of you in japanese
cut back to reveal takashi wearing a white sequined tuxedo with tails as he plays a white grand piano
he looks like an asian liberace
he is circled by a group of japanese children who sing along with him
takashi sings tin pan alley for youngsters is the hottest show on japanese television
the sweat shops are working overtime trying to keep up with the demand
record albums toys cereal tee shirts you name it
several tough looking asian men chick sambo and tobi takashis management group sits in stokes office
takashi sits quietly in the corner
stokes sits behind his desk sipping his trademark glass of wine
look stokes lets cut the bullshit
we want takashi in that smoochy slot and were willing to do whatever it takes to get it
pardon me for saying this but for a non resident of this country you speak impeccable english
im originally from teaneck
we own every hair on this bastards head and were willing to share a few strands
if you get my drift
well its not that simple
i have an executive board to answer to
i wish i could just snap my fingers and make a deal but
you mean like this
chick snaps his fingers and tobi the third asian guy walks over and drops a duffel bag on stokes desk
and what is this on my desk
two hundred grand in a louis vuitton duffle bag
get our boy the slot and well round it off to a million
and you can keep the luggage
stokes stares down at the bundle of opportunity on his desk
youre dealing with an honorable culture frank
we know how to play ball
stokes unzips the bag and gazes at the money
he looks up at chick and smiles
gentlemen i suddenly feel invigorated and full of hope
on noras tv screen we see the black and white image of rickets the hippo doing the klunky wunky dance
nora sits on the couch and stares hypnotically at the screen
there is a knock at the door
she gets up and ejects the best of rickets tape
she opens the door
to her surprise randolph is standing there
before she can respond he enters the apartment and takes off his jacket
so heres the good news yes ill be happy to end my sabbatical and return to my old slot
i know you and frank are in a bind so ill start monday
call wardrobe call props tell em the r man is back and hes ready to start whistlin dem happy tunes for da little chillens
he flops down on the couch
who do ya gotta blow to get a scotch around here
youve got three seconds to pry your ass off my couch and get out
randolph jumps to his feet
the rhinos gone
you need that slot filled and im ready to reclaim whats rightfully mine
just in case you forgot youre a criminal and a scumbag
okay so maybe i commandeered a stray shekel or two
compared to what smoochy did thats like jerking off in the supermarket
where do you shop
randolph walks over and puts his hands on her shoulders
have you lost all affection for me
after what we once had
that was a long time ago
i was young and stupid
why we broke up ill never know
you turned into an asshole and i didnt love you
we couldve worked through all that
he leans in to kiss her and she shoves him away so violently he almost falls over the coffee table
damn it nora
the public is clamoring for me
im a fucking patriot
mopes is a nazi
hes probably even gay
you shouldve seen the way he was checking me out in the car
suddenly suspicious what does that mean
what does what mean
you said he was checking you out in the car
its just a vibe
a nazi homosexual vibe
it emanates from the television
the whole smoochy costume
with the erect horn
i mean whats that all about
nora starts to walk closer to him
he backs up
youre talking awfully fast randolph
i still love you
lets go on a date
were you at that rally
did you have something to do with this
she backs him against the wall and looks him in the eye
did you set sheldon up
randolph just looks at her
you know now i remember why we broke up
always with the accusations
bitch bitch bitch
nora hauls off and punches him in the jaw
a morose looking spinner dunn sits alone at the end of the bar in the nightclub
tommy walks over
whats wrong kid
the mayor of pattersons here with his wife
they wanna meet ya
i dont wanna meet no one
i miss smoochy
he never woulda done the things they say he done
he aint no nazi
someones making stuff up
i just know it tommy
someones making stuff up
spinner starts violently pounding his head on the bar causing glasses to rattle
i want smoochy back
i want to be on tv again
i want to play my cowbell
nora enters the restaurant
she looks around and approaches tommy
has burke been in tonight
havent seen him
something i can help you with
i have to talk to him
its about sheldon
spinner lifts his head from the bar
what about sheldon
randolph is napping on angelos couch with an ice pack on his sore jaw thanks to noras fist
there is a sudden loud pounding at the door
randolph startles awake
im trying to sleep asshole
read the fucking meter some other time
after a beat the door is kicked open and tommy and his crew are standing there
you wanna tell me about the rhino
hey this is private property creep
and youre trespassing
danny go give mr
smiley a little back rub
danny advances toward a shaking randolph fist clenched and rolling up his sleeve
he cocks his arm and throws a punch
dannys fist fills the frame turning it black as we hear the punch
newspaper trucks pull up to various newsstands and toss out bundles of the morning editions
as each bundle lands on the curb we see headlines that span over the next few days randolph bruised and battered emerges from the police station with his lawyer
reporters and photographers rush forward
how does it feel to be voted the most hated man in america randolph
in a country like this where your average citizen is a fuckin neanderthal i wear it as a badge of honor
what about ms
bishops charge that you have an unhealthy obsession with sheldon mopes
listen i barely know that broad
shes a wacko
im the most accused man since jimmy hoffa
someone throws an egg and it hits randolph in the face
on verge of tears that was unfair
who threw that
that was mean and uncalled for
my client is not answering any more questions
between his dwindling cash flow and mounting legal bills hes sinking into a deep psychotic depression
please stop antagonizing him
he pushes a sullen randolph through the cluster of people
a makeup woman dabs sheldons forehead as hes about to go on
nora stands next to him
a low tympany roll is heard from the stage
to nora i wouldnt be back here if it wasnt for you
im just sorry i didnt believe you
that i got swept up in the frenzy of anti smoochyism
well this towns a house of mirrors sometimes
its hard to know what youre looking at
he takes a couple of pre show deep breaths
a stagehand approaches
theyre ready for you sheldon
sheldon exits backstage
the lights in the studio dim
ladies and gentlemen
boys and girls
dramatic pause whos your favorite rhino
an explosion of enthusiasm from the kids in the bleachers
the lights come up as the smoochyland band plays a strong dramatic version of battle hymn of the republic
after a moment smoochy slowly rises from a lift under the stage
a giant sign above the jungle lights up and emits a pyrotechnic shower of sparks
it reads welcome home smoochy
a beaming spinner dunn enthusiastically bangs his cowbell to the music as tears stream down his cheeks
he majestically stands center stage and nods to the kids who are giving him a standing ovation
the song crescendos with a rousing final chorus from the smoochyland band who sing his truth is marching on
thunderous applause from the bleachers
smoochy walks over to a stool and takes a seat
its very quiet in the studio now
smoochy looking uncharacteristically serious picks up a microphone as the lights go down
hes in black limbo
its good to be back
you know kids sometimes life in the jungle can be unfair
a place where nice guys dont just finish last
they get their heads cut off
gasps from the bleachers
that pretty world you think you know is just props and scenery
lollipop trees with roots in venom
watches nervously from offstage
so look around you boys and girls
as the old proverb says beat a dog one time too many and you get a wolf
lets start howling
howl for me boys and girls
the kids in the bleachers howl along with smoochy
okay i just wanted to get that off my chest
who wants to do the hokey pokey
the kids cheer as the smoochyland band launches into the hokey pokey song and smoochy starts dancing
the kids pour out of the bleachers onto the jungle set
everyone is dancing and having a ball
nora is clapping to the music offstage
sheldon and nora exchange affectionate glances
randolph sits in front of the television in a daze
hes wearing a ratty bathrobe and absentmindedly tosses cheese curls onto the floor from a bag on his lap
on the tv an entertainment tonight type show with two perky hosts is covering smoochys return to the airwaves
the hosts tara and hunter show smoochys dynamic entrance and the standing ovation he got during the taping that day
well smoochys back and boy did we miss him
hundreds of well wishers stood outside kidnet studios today hoping to catch a glimpse of their favorite rhino
thats right tara
smoochys popularity is stronger than ever thanks to his recent exoneration as a nazi sympathizer
in fact several movie studios are offering big bucks for a chance to bring the smoochy story to the silver screen
the broadcast continues
smoochy images flash across the screen
randolph has been mumbling the whole time
quietly to himself bad
too much for brain
he jumps up and kicks the tv over
he picks up a lamp and starts beating the tv
i hate you
i fucking hate you
you devil horned mind fucker
die die die
angelo who was cooking in the kitchen runs out
hes wearing an apron
what are you doing
thats a zenith
notices cheese curls look at this place
he grabs the lamp from randolph
i want you out of here
suddenly scared where am i supposed to go
i dont care
pointing to door out
spinners massive arms envelope sheldon in a bear hug practically lifting him out of his seat
burke whos having dinner with sheldon holds onto the table before it gets knocked over
watch the ribs buddy
i missed you so much
i missed you too champ
he drops sheldon and pulls out his cowbell
ive been practicing and practicing and i got real good sheldon
he starts banging on it with a butter knife
wanna see me march
sure why not
spinner starts marching through the restaurant clanging the cowbell
people who are trying to eat their dinner look annoyed
sheldon sits back down at his table
so you were saying you had some good news
some very good news
after giving it a lot of thought
ive decided to do the ice show
burke gleefully slaps sheldon on the shoulder
i got me a bar mitzvah boy
today you are a man
i realize now its a sin to waste your power
like they say rock bottoms a college education
but heres the really good news im doing it myself
no sponsors no vendors no crooks
not one dirty hand will touch this
not one person will make a dollar off these kids
smoochy on ice will be a study in purity
burkes grin suddenly fades
as far as food concessions go ill supply the refreshments
low sodium whole wheat pretzels and apple slices
now are you ready for the best part
im holding my breath
all profits from ticket sales will be used to built a state of the art methadone clinic in coney island
burke looks pale
im not just talking a run of the mill clinic
im going to build a methadone palace
a place where men and women can withdraw in luxury
sheldon you cant do an ice show and cut out the vendors
and more importantly you cant cut out the parade of hope
you always told me when youve got muscles you make the rules
well im feeling pretty strong right now
sheldon rises and tosses his napkin down
all this time i was letting the business use me
well i think its time i start using the business
ive got my clout back and im not gonna waste it this time
take care of it burke
burke sits there looking very concerned
on his way out the door tommy stops sheldon
spinners cowbell clanging continues
shel you gotta help me out
he bangs that goddamn thing from morning till night
i got a headache that goes from my eyes to my ass
whatever i can do tommy just say it
you know i love spinner
and i owe you
give the boy something else to do on the show
just as long as it dont clang chime or honk
theres a gun to his temple
chick the asian representative of takashi holds a revolver on stokes
his cohorts sambo and tobi stand by
i dont like complications frank
you got one week to get takashi that slot or youre gonna be shakin hands with buddha
dont you understand
my hands are tied
the rhinos been exonerated
the shows more popular than ever
to sambo and tobi okay boys chop him up bag him and dump him in the woods
sambo and tobi start to advance on stokes
ill take care of it
i just need time
chick leans into stokes face
one week jeeves
or i get a blender and make an orange julius with your feet
a down and out randolph shuffles along in ratty bedroom slippers
he passes a man who sits behind a small table on the sidewalk
the table has a huge photograph of a rhinoceros taped in front of it
literature and pamphlets depicting the black rhino are spread out on the table
save the rhino
before its too late
make a donation
save the rhino
to randolph hey mister ya wanna help save the rhino
randolph just looks at him for a moment
he looks at all the rhino related imagery
he starts shaking and suddenly jumps over the table and attacks the man
im the one who needs to be saved
i lost my lawyer
my only friend kicked me out
im a fucking peanut shell in the shape of a man
save the rainbow
save the rainbow
save the rainbow
someone call a cop
randolph grabs the collection can and runs off
its a chilly grey afternoon
stokes and burke walk along the lake framed by the new york skyline
your client is suffocating me
to make matters worse hes caused me to veer into a hazardous situation
a situation that otherwise could have a very happy ending
tell me more about the asians
and best of all they know how the game is played
they respect our delicate ecosystem of mutual benefit
stokes stops walking and grabs burkes arm
id bring you in on this burke
youd be my partner on the takashi deal
split down the middle
we have an opportunity to get back on track here
back to the way it was
the good old days
the two men look at each other as thoughts pass silently between them
this is very sticky ground were about to walk on
well youre used to a little glue on your shoes
let me poke around
sift through the possibilities
a slender young man in a peter pan costume in being held by a big thug as another thug beats him up
a girl dressed as tinkerbell also being restrained looks on in horror
merv green parade of hope steps into frame
this is what happens to guys who keep secrets johnny
ill give you the rest next week
its not me youre fucking over its sick kids
you got something against sick kids johnny
the thug punches him in the stomach again
i love sick kids
merv nods to one of the thugs who releases peter pan
he slumps to the ground
merv kneels down and lifts his head from the pavement
and you tell that fat producer of yours if he ever gives me a low head count again hell lose the other thumb
one of mervs thugs leans in whispers something to merv who looks up to see
burke standing in the mouth of the alley
hows tricks kid
well if it aint smilin burke
whose bones are you pickin today
chuckles you got a minute pally
burke and merv walk along nd street
a poster advertises peter pan sponsored by parade of hope giving children the gift of promise
mervs thugs trail behind
no one freezes me out of an ice show
i dont care how many fucking clinics hes trying to save
look im chokin on the same bone as you
if youre trying to aggravate me youre doing a hell of a job
im not here to aggravate just educate
i think mopes might be talking to people he shouldnt be talking to
thats an ugly string of words
hes got it in his head that hes gonna clean up the way we do business
i wouldnt be surprised if hes wearing a wire
burke looks at his watch
jesus i got a thing across town
he steps off the curb to hail a cab
lets keep talking merv
theres oughta be some kind of solution
dont you think
burke hops into a cab
merv watches the cab pull away
the table is set on the sidewalk
a mans legs enter the frame and shakily climb on top of the table
randolph stands on the table directly in front of the kidnet building
he raises the megaphone to his mouth
attention new yorkers
you are about to hear a shocking story of injustice
randolph stands on the table directly in front of the kidnet building
i urge you to listen
it has a surprise ending you wont want to miss
a crowd starts to form on the sidewalk
its the story of a venomous rhino and his aggressive campaign to slander vilify defame denigrate and villainize my good name
but one thing he cant do is take my life from me
no friends only i have the power to do that
he reaches down and picks up a can of gasoline
this is what smoochy has done to me
hes brought me to this
i can no longer live in a world where the innocent suffer and the wicked thrive
randolph raises the can over his head and pauses dramatically
where is god
he drenches himself with gasoline
the crowd grows larger
he holds up a pack of matches
im sorry to do this people
dont try to talk me out of it
the crowd starts to applaud
randolph looks baffled
our guest of honor will be here any moment
this is for his eyes
for his conscience
hell have to live with this imagine for the rest of his miserable life
sheldon sits in the back of a limo on his way to work reading the paper
the headline blares smoochy announces ice show at garden
the subhead reads to driver take it from me lester
use your power
dont squander it build with it
sound advice mr
if i ever get any power ill give that a whirl
notices crowd up ahead hey whats going on up there
sheldon glances up from his paper
casually looks like a street performer of some sort
he goes back to his paper
randolph sees the kidnet limo approaching
this is it folks
im sorry to do this but hes left me no choice
randolph tries to light another match but its wet from the gasoline
the crowd laughs and starts taunting him
shut up you hillbilly assholes
youre borough trash
go back to your huts across the river
randolph keeps trying to light the match
finally after several attempts it lights
he holds it up
the crowd burst into applause
fuck all you people
i was the last of the mohicans
youll never see another rainbow randolph in this lifetime
you had me and you blew it
all of you
he turns and faces the approaching limousine
this if for you smoochy
as long as you live remember this image
you did this to me
he brings the match closer to his gasoline soaked body
the limo continues to approach
the crowd taunts him to do it
he tries to bring the match closer but his hand is shaking
suddenly a little girl pushes through the crowd
everyone quiets down as she looks up at randolph
whatcha doin rainbow randolph
randolph freezes as he looks down at the little girl
a slight look of hope comes over his face
she smiles sweetly at him walks over and blows out the match
randolph is overcome with emotion
just then sheldons limo whooshes past him
the crowd cheers
they all run away from randolph and over to sheldons limo as it pulls in front of the kidnet building
randolph stares at them blankly
he looks down
the little girl is gone
sheldon gets out of the limo
the crowd cheers him as he waves to them before going inside
a look of utter frustration now comes over randolph
randolph drops to his knees on the table looks skyward and screams
what does it all mean
the camera rises above him as he lets out an anguished howl that reverberates through the skyscrapers
what do you mean i cant play the cowbell no more
sheldon gently tries to break the news to spinner whos on the verge of tears
youre too talented for the cowbell spinner
cowbells are for babies
a little angry i aint no baby
youre a fully grown man
the whole sha bang
thats why you deserve a bigger role on the show
a more important role
spinners face starts to perk up
its the middle of a smoochy taping
smoochy and the gang are wrapping up a song entitled my stepdads not mean hes just adjusting
the kids in the bleachers are singing the chorus
stepdads are people too they have bad days like we all do be patient and help them through stepdads are people too
smoochy continues the song
singing so three cheers for the man that i proudly call stan
hes not quite a dad or a brother
yes he gets cross but still hes the boss
and besides he takes care of my mother
the song ends
the kids in the bleachers applaud
smoochy addresses them
first impressions good or bad are not always what they seem
just like a new puppy new dads need to adjust to their surroundings
so give em time
but always remember
if he becomes abusive to you or mommy
what are the magic numbers
shouting in unison nine one one
right o riffic
the smoochyland band plays a little fanfare
and now boys and girls i have a special surprise
id like to introduce the newest member of the magic jungle
moochy the rhino
the smoochyland band plays a happy little song as spinner dunn in costume as moochy runs on stage
the moochy costume is identical to smoochy only its a darker orange instead of bright orange
welcome to the jungle
you wanna say howdy to the kids
he stares at the camera
my name is moochy
weve established that
leaning into sheldon sheldon this costumes makin my nuts itch
sheldon looks horrified
the smoochyland band quickly launches into some music
smoochy moochy and a few other jungle animals begin to dance
moochys lumbering movements are in stark contrast to the choreographed steps of the others
as a bonus he occasionally scratches his crotch
a happy spinner still in costume as moochy pokes his head into sheldons dressing room
sheldon still in costume as well looks drained after the difficult taping
that was fun
was it bad when i done that thing where i tripped and knocked over the flamingo and then he knocked over the cameraman and then those lights fell down on
that ladys head
its fine spinner
well edit it out
but tomorrow in rehearsal were gonna work on a new thing called the importance of hitting your mark
i get to hit something
spinner dances off
a beat later nora enters and shuts the door
theres an awkward beat of silence
i read about the ice show
yeah the papers seem to be really covering it
i think its great
what youre doing for that clinic
i just need some clarification
spinner just needs a little more rehearsal
ill get him there
no i mean about us
sheldon looks uncomfortable
ever since youve been back i just feel like theres something thats not connecting
i guess im still readjusting a little
like a guy whos come back from the war
not that id equate my misfortune with the brave men and women who protect us overseas
i just thought we were on our way to something
granted my mistaken belief that you had ties to neo nazis might have put a damper on our relationship but im sorry for sheldon suddenly jumps up and grabs her
he kisses her passionately
nora immediately starts ripping off his costume as they make out
they fall to the floor in a lustful embrace
spinner humming to himself lumbers down the hallway on his way to the wardrobe room
halfway down the hall he hears a voice call out to him
spinner turns around
the door to the fire exit swings open
two of mervs thugs emerge and grab spinner whos still in full moochy costume and drag him into the stairwell
spinner is dragged into the garage and knocked to the pavement
several more thugs emerge from the shadows including henry mervs main henchman
they start beating him with lead pipes
henry pulls out a revolver
he shoots the rhino several times
a sedan trunk is popped open and moochy is thrown inside
the car screeches up to the street
we crane down from a chinese banner that stretches across two tenements
we land on the seedy deserted street below as the sedan barrels into frame and squeals to a stop
two thugs emerge from the car
they pull spinner moochy from the trunk and toss his body by some garbage cans knocking a few over
they get back in the car and speed away
moochys lifeless foam body rolls into the gutter and lays motionless
blood seeps through his foamy torso
of spinner moochy
we slowly start to rise up as we look down at the rhinos body
the wind whistles through the empty street as we get higher
the chinese banner rustles through the frame
as we get higher and higher we hear the intermittent clang of a prize fight bell
in the same frame detectives and uniformed cops are now at the scene gathering evidence
where spinner once lay there is now a bright yellow chalk outline in the shape of a rhinoceros
full frame on a television screen
a local news anchor is reading the top story
former heavyweight contender and restaurateur lawrence spinner dunn was found shot to death in a rhinoceros outfit early this morning in chinatown
dunn a frequent performer on smoochys magic jungle was pronounced dead at the scene
police are searching for a hand enters frame and violently slaps the tv off
an enraged merv green glares at his henchmen henry and how could you hit the wrong rhino
who knew smoochy had a cousin moochy
they look fucking identical
smoochy is bright orange moochy is burnt rust
read the papers
do i gotta take you back to fucking kindergarten
all you said was hit the rhino
you never specified the color
im not taking the blame for this one
mervs anger builds
he turns to a picture of smoochy which is tacked to a bulletin board along with other kid show personalities that the foundation extorts
merv picks up a letter opener and violently thrusts it into the picture
im not through with you yet rhino
your time will fucking come
cops rummage through angelos apartment
in the b
a detective ellis interviews angelo
another detective mccall is looking through some papers he found
mccall ellie over here
ellis walks over
mccall shows him some scribblings hes found in a notebook of randolphs
the crude drawings depict smoochy with his head cut off
with a knife in his heart
being pissed on by randolph etc
die rhino die is scrawled hundreds of times filling page after page
the two detectives look at each other and nod
spinner sleeps forever in an open casket clutching his cowbell
dozens of spinners relatives are at the wake
a bagpipe player plays amazing grace
sheldon stands at the casket fighting back tears as he stares down at his old friend
nora has her arm around him
its my fault
hed still be alive if it wasnt for me
he would have been so proud to be in the ice show
there was nothing you could have done
dont torture yourself
im sorry spinner
im so sorry
tommy and the boys walk over
tommy puts his arm around sheldon as he gazes somberly at spinner
he really loved you shel
and this i guarantee that fucking randolph has seen his last rainbow
were gonna find him cut off his balls and shove em up his ass
maybe you better leave it to the police
they wont do the ball thing
its against procedure
dont forget that hit was meant for you shel
so from now on everywhere you go we go
thats okay tommy
ill be fine
and as christ is my witness no ones touchin a hair on your fuckin head
spinner would have wanted it that way
tommys crew nods and agrees
to the boys alright boys lets get shit faced
they head for the bar
nora and sheldon look down at spinner in silence
didnt rickets the hippo have a song about death
the last nappy time
it gave me a lot of comfort when my mother died
sings quietly when doggies stop barking and fish cease to swim and grandpa lays silent from his head to his limbs sadness will find you but soon youll feel fine
sheldon joins in
in life we all have our last nappy time
sheldon looks at her
they embrace as bagpipe music the news zipper in times square glides through the night air manhunt underway for rainbow randolph
suspected we crane down from the zipper onto the sidewalk
randolph is talking on a pay phone
we hear angelo on the other end
i didnt do it
i know youre still mad at me but you gotta believe me
the papers say you were the mastermind
i can barely figure out how to unzip my pants these days
just taking a piss is a logistical nightmare
i believe you randy
but you cant come back to my place
theyll find you
you gotta go underground
we are outside the long abandoned liberty biscuit and flour factory
the liberty sign with its statue of liberty logo is eroded and partially missing
inside the massive dormant factory rats scurry around and pigeons occasionally fly from window sill to window sill
a makeshift living area has been set up in the middle of it all a chair lamp small table hot plate etc
randolph lays on the dilapidated conveyor belt huddled under a blanket
angelo enters the factory through a rusty door carrying provisions
its heatin up out there
every cop in new york is looking for you
and tommy cotters boys are combin the streets
youre gonna have to stay put for a while
randolph sits up on the conveyor belt blanket draped over his shoulders
hes a physical and emotional wreck
i was an altar boy once
did you know that
i wanted to be a priest
do you believe in angels angie
there was a little angel in pigtails
she was the only one who cared about me
she saved my life
angelo hops up on the conveyor belt to console randolph
randolph rests his head on angelos shoulder
you didnt want to kill yourself randy
you know that
perhaps its time to heal
to accept the fact that smoochy has won and gracefully march forward
true im currently wanted for a murder i didnt commit
but i have faith
faith that justice will prevail
now youre talkin kid
this is a big step
im proud of you
he strokes randolphs head
did you bring lunch
chicken and stars
just like you asked for
can i have some please
for a smile
randolph sniffs and manages a small pitiful smile
angelo musses his hair
angelo lifts one of the grocery bags onto the conveyor belt
here i got you some crossword puzzles and stuff to read
angelo hops off the conveyor belt and turns on the hot plate
he starts to open a can of soup
randolph reaches into the bag and pulls out a copy of the new york post
the lead articles headline reads wake for spinner
a large photograph shows mourners leaving the restaurant after the wake
clearly visible are sheldon and nora
they have their arms around each other
randolphs eyes widen
he starts to hyperventilate
angelo looks up
finally randolph expels a blood curdling scream that echoes through the factory
angelo drops the soup
birds in the factory flutter from the rafters
sheldon and the rhinettes work on some choreography for that nights show
nora watches from the sidelines
as sheldon skates on the ice rink merv enters with roy and danny
sheldon skates over to them
nora walks over too
big news shel
it wasnt smiley who killed spinner
it was parade of hope
are you sure
the cops have tons of evidence on randolph
we did our own investigation
cousin ian from down at the morgue
you met him at the wake
tommy is at the bar listening intently to a man ian who is pointing to certain details on a photograph
see the neck
snapped like a twig
parade of hopes calling card
when they do a guy they like to sign the tab
whats that guys name over there
yeah merv green
this was one time they shoulda left the tab blank
i knew merv green was a scumbag from the day he grabbed my ass at a feed the children benefit
well god help those guys now
theyre gonna get a first class ride through the criminal justice system and im buying the tickets
its all taken care of shel
what does that mean
a bloodied merv green is tied to a chair in the middle of the warehouse as he begs tommy for his life
mervs two henchmen lay dead nearby
roy jimmy and sammy tommys guys stand behind her
it was a mistake
an honest mistake
all im trying to do is help children
you like kids huh
so you must know a few fairy tales
danny tell him the one about the worthless prick who gets his head chopped off
danny holding a hatchet advances toward merv
tommy casually walks away
we stay with tommy
merv is no no
we hear the sound of the hatchet hitting its target
mervs pleading stops
now you know why charities go under sometimes
do we really need to hear this
i dont want to hear this
a clean cut
okay got it
and then we took his head and thank you
specifics about his head are superfluous at this point
nora is alone in stokes office rearranging cards on the giant cork board that displays the network schedule
she is startled to hear a deep voice behind her
where is he
she turns around
chick tobi and sambo are standing there
chick walks over to the cork board
he scans a row of cards that all read smoochy
attitude can i help you with something
yeah honey you can help us with something
he rips a smoochy index card from the board walks over to her and waves it in her face
you tell that boss of yours he better take care of the rhino problem
in my culture we honor deals or invite consequences
i dont know what youre talking about and your colognes making me nauseous
other than that youre great company
chick looks at his boys and chuckles
spicy little thing isnt she
he suddenly pulls out a switchblade and holds it to noras throat
takashi gets that time slot
you hear me girly
tell that boss of yours well kill everyone at this fucking network if we have to
starting with the pretty ones
he removes the knife from her throat and hurls it toward the bulletin board
it lands sticking right in the middle of a smoochy card
auf wiedersehen honey
nora is pacing
sheldon sits by the fire
hes behind the whole thing
he cut some kind of deal for the smoochy slot
what are you talking about
he wants you out so he can put takashi in
dont you ever pick up a copy of international performer
hes the hottest kid show host from asia
sheldons head is swimming
suddenly the front door to to the penthouse bursts open
randolph dressed like hes about to do his old show stumbles in waving a gun
how very cozy
like two logs in a little bonfire
all we need is a few sticks and some wienies
he almost trips as he stumbles over to sheldon
he waves the gun in his face
i had her before you
i was in love with her
and you snatched her away
like a common thief
youre the bad guy
hes the bad guy nora
hes incapable of understanding the love we once had
tender yet passionate
old fashioned yet experimental
cackles tell him about a few of our experiments nora
sheldon looks stunned
nora hangs her head
to nora is this true
please tell me its just the confused ramblings of a diseased mind
she looks at him but doesnt say anything
holy mother of toledo
when exactly were you planning to let me know about this
turns to sheldon listen there was a time and im not proud of this but there was a time when i was a bit of a
kiddie host groupie
youre just another action figure for her collection
thats not fair
tell him about jingle jackson
you dated jingle jackson
the bells turned her on
hey tell him about jumbo johnny
theres a tale for ya
a whale of a tale
she looks down somewhat ashamed
a look of utter shock comes over sheldon
oh good lord in heaven
look what i did before i met you is none of your business
both of you
this is my show
he waves the gun threateningly as he backs up to an armchair and sits down
do you fully understand the power of a condemned man
im already wanted for one murder why should i give a flaming horses twat if i commit two more
read once that the best way to diffuse a tense situation is with a little humor
to that end would you like to hear a funny joke
rolling his eyes oh please
go blow yourself martha
waves gun again fix me a beverage woman
make me one of those drinks that used to make us all warm and fuzzy before bouncy bouncy time
fix it yourself asshole
points to gun remember i have mr
im telling you youd love this joke
it revolves around santa claus and the easter bunny getting into a fender bender
nora rolls her eyes and goes to the bar
to sheldon you know when i lived here i used to have a big painting above the fireplace
a naked chick holding a pumpkin
it was very tasteful
we know it wasnt you who killed spinner
well go to the police first thing tomorrow
straighten everything out
goody goody gumdrops
to nora vodka straight up is fine sugar babe
he grabs the bottle out of her hand
he rises from the chair
he takes a cd party time with rainbow randolph from his pocket and puts it into an audio system on the fireplace wall
did you put on a little weight honey
thats okay youre still a hot little brood mare
i bet you miss the sweet sting of my riding crop
giddy up pony
the theme song from his show starts to play
he flicks a switch and a spotlight goes on
he sings and dances
to tune of ol macdonald rainbow randolph is the man
yes he yes he is
hes the prez of rainbowland
yes he yes he is
with some fun fun here and a laugh laugh there
here a dance there a song everything is fun fun
rainbow randolph is the king the king of rainbowland
randolph takes another drink from the vodka bottle
sheldon suddenly lunges at randolph and tries to grab the gun
the two men wrestle on the floor but randolph is not much of a fighter
he screams as sheldon rolls him toward the fireplace
is this what you want
a hansel and gretel ending
you want to be the big bad wolf
its too hot
its driving me mad
randolph rolls sheldon to the bottom
nora reaches for a fireplace poker and whacks randolph with it
randolph cries out and drops the gun
sheldon grabs it and points it at randolph who lies on the floor blubbering like a child
go ahead kill me
finish me off
my lifes over anyway
everything i touch turns to shit
put me out of my misery
sheldon slowly takes the gun away from randolphs head
youre not nothing
youre bitter misguided and im guessing a raging alcoholic but youre still rainbow randolph
despite everything thats happened you once made children happy
randolph sits up and looks at sheldon through watery eyes
would you be my friend
to nora you too
sorry about the brood mare stuff
randolph throws his arms around sheldon and cries into his shoulder
sheldon pats his back
he glances down at randolphs gun and sees that its a toy
nora pours vodka onto a small pillow shes taken from one of the chairs
she kneels next to randolph and blots the gash on his head with the vodka soaked pillow
randolph lets out a blood curdling scream
sheldon loads his gun as randolph is curled up on the couch like a little puppy
nora hands him a cup of tea
a pitiful child thank you
she walks over to sheldon
re gun what are you doing
sheldon continues to load the gun
just making the playing field even
im tired of running this race with one leg
youre letting them drag you down to their level
from couch shes right sheldon
dont make the same mistakes i did
keep your dignity intact
he accidentally spills some hot tea on himself
son of a bitch
i appreciate everyones concern but i can take care of myself
nora and randolph look at each other
mouthing to nora i tried
sheldon stuffs some extra bullets in his pocket
to randolph okay buddy we have to get down to the garden
youre welcome to stay here as long as you like
just dont leave until i get things squared away
randolph gets up and walks over to him
be careful sheldon
remember what i told you youve only scratched the surface of this scummy business
you have yet to strike oil
randolph looks at him for a moment before turning to nora
youre lucky to have a guy like smoochy
you just rest randolph
hes the real thing
smoochys the real thing
and ive been a fraud
a wicked man doing wicked acts
sheldon slaps the cylinder into place and tucks the gun in his waistband
well we all have our bad days
a hula dancer performs on a tiny stage in the nightclub
a small hawaiian string band plays behind her
burke and a nervous looking stokes sit in a booth
things are getting out of hand
we have to cover our tracks
relax everythings gonna work out
they found merv greens head on the grand concourse
excuse my concern
look we can cover all the tracks we want but in the end we still got the same problem
we gotta finish what we started
god help us
stokes shakily takes a sip of his drink
itll all be over tonight
buggys gonna take care of everything
buggy ding dong
the guy who hosted buggys bumpy railroad
yeah until he discovered the joys of turkish black mule heroin
for the right price hell do anything

stokes buries his head in his hands
i dont know burke

a shadow falls across their table
burke looks up
speak of the devil

buggy ding dongs hand enters the frame and snubs out his camel
stokes looks up
attempting to sound cheerful buggy
youre looking good
a man who looks like he would first kill you then eat you for dinner slides into the booth next to stokes
its time we put this thing to rest frank
and the way i see it
the rhinos up past his bedtime
burke hands a folded envelope to buggy who puts it into his jacket pocket
he lights another camel
smooch on ice sold out
flashes on the electronic marquee
men women and children flood in through the turnstiles
ushers costumed as rhinettes help people to their seats
people mull about the concession stands which are adorned with signs that read complimentary apple slices
have a salt free pretzel
enjoy a soy dog on smoochy
fresh squeezed o
have a glass
sugar free brownies theyre not as bad as they sound
everything is free
keep your wallet in your pocket
friendship is more important than money
angelos place looks like a cyclone hit it
angelo works free from the ropes that have bound his wrists
he has been hit over the head and is groggy as he reaches for the phone
a freshly showered randolph is wearing sheldons robe and has a pink towel wrapped around his head as he lounges on the living room sofa
hes eating grapes and reading national geographic
the phone rings
he picks it up
sing songy hellooo
we go to a split screen with angelo
randy is that you
yes angelo my little twinkie shouldnt you be getting ready for the big show
listen buggys been here
buggy double ds
the dong man

he suddenly looks very worried
sheldons in trouble
i gotta get down to the garden
the place is crawling with cops
theyll jump on you like a trampoline
i dont care
he rips the towel from his head
i have to warn the rhino
buggy in his ill fitting rhinette costume emerges from the sub basement carrying a thin suitcase
as far as anyones concerned hes just another usher
he heads for the stairwell
every seat in the arena is occupied
the lights are lowered
a slow rolling tympany is heard
after a moment the rhinettes skate out to enthusiastic applause
sheldon looking very intense stands alone in the wings
he takes a couple of deep breaths
we tilt down and see the bulge of the revolver under his smoochy costume
the rhinettes have formed a line across the middle of the rink
it gives us great pleasure to introduce americas favorite rhino
ladies and gentlemen
boys and girls
dramatic pause heeeeeres smoochy
smoochy skates out to thunderous applause
the entire arena is on its feet
the rhinettes part as smoochy skates through them and stops in the middle of the rink
the applause and cheering dont stop for several moments
one of the rhinettes hands smoochy a microphone
on behalf of myself the rhinettes and the soon to be restored coney island methadone center i thank you all for coming
burke and stokes roll their eyes
it was my original intention that tonights performance would be a benign mix of smoochy songs and ice dancing
but as an artist i believe i must convey to you my fans what im feeling at any given moment in my life
to do otherwise would be dishonest
art is communication
its something we learn and hopefully grow from
with that in mind
i hope you enjoy the show
more applause as smoochy skates over to the rhinettes
they form a circle around him and slap hands in solidarity
this is for spinner
the lights go down
a full orchestra begins to play the overture to wagners tristen et isolde
the lights come up as a soprano a heavyset woman in a modified rhino costume skates out through the fog and begins singing the opera
smoochy now wearing a peasants frock skates an interpretive dance in the b
with a few rhinettes who are also dressed as peasants
a beautiful fairy princess floats down on filament wire from the rafters and takes smoochys hand
she skates away with him as he waves good bye to the rhinettes
looking down at the opera
the camera pans over to the catwalk high above the rink
buggy ding dong still in his rhinette costume settles into his assassins roost
he begins to assemble the rifle and check the scope
randolph emerges from a cab and runs through the crowd outside the garden
a few people recognize him
its rainbow randolph
someone stop him
randolph finds a side exit and slips into the arena
the opera on ice continues
the soprano continues singing as smoochy reenacts the incidents of his recent life
the fairy princess brings smoochy to a room with a gleaming white desk
smoochy takes a seat behind the desk
the fairy princess places a crown on his head bids him good bye and floats away
smoochy sits proudly in his new world
suddenly rhinettes dressed as devils glide in and skate in a circle around the desk
they throw money at smoochy
he jumps up and skates away but the rhinette devils pursue him with daggers
the music from the orchestra intensifies as the drama plays out
nora continues to watch the opera totally entranced
stokes and burke look a little on edge
burke glances at his watch
buggy finishes loading the rifle
he shines the barrel with his sleeve and looks through the scope as smoochy and company continue to perform below
atmospheric fog created by the smoke machine is so thick that buggy has difficulty finding sheldon through the cross hairs
occasionally smoochy skates through a hole in the clouds only to disappear again
buggy curses in frustration
randolph pushes his way past garden security and runs toward the rink
several cops working the event spot him
a few spectators scream in horror
the sopranos mournful aria reaches its crescendo as smoochy is now pursued by rhinettes dressed as nazis
they hold signs with words like scandal and shame
smoochy skates to a section of the rink resembling chinatown where he lands over a fallen moochy
he cradles moochys head in his arms as the nazis glide past him and disappear into the fog
nora wipes a tear from her eye as she watches the tragedy play out
burke and stokes glance skyward
nora notices this
randolph reaches the rink as cops push their way toward him
but sheldon cant hear over the orchestra
the soprano hits a high note
buggy aims the rifle
smoochy glides through the cross hairs followed by a rhinette
as he quickly squeezes off a shot
the muffled sound of gunshot is absorbed by the intense music
a wounded rhinette falls to the ice but no one notices
smoochy oblivious continues to skate toward the gates of heaven with the angel moochy
giant white gates slowly swing open at the rinks far end as floating angels open their arms to welcome moochy
randolph runs around the rinks perimeter trying to get sheldons attention
cops and security push their way towards randolph
he suddenly notices the felled rhinette on the ice and looks skyward
he can make out a rifle barrel protruding from the catwalk
stokes and burke notice a commotion in the audience
they now see randolph running through the crowd on his way to the stairwell
whispering to burke whats he doing here
hes going to screw everything up
nora notices the distressed look on their faces and follows their gaze to the rafters
she now sees the rifle barrel
jumps to her feet
fast push in to noras mouth
she starts to climb out of the box but burke stops her
youre in on this arent you
you sold him out
you fucking snake
stokes tries to put his arm around her
its not what you think
im grooming you
youre going to run the division one day
she pushes him
he goes down hard
she starts to climb out of the box
burke tries to grab her but she spins around and punches him
she runs for the rink
stokes stands in the box looking dumbstruck as pande monium plays out around him
people are running in all directions cops are everywhere
frightened to burke what now
what do we do now
survival of the fittest
burke runs off through the panicked crowd
stokes looks around and heads off in the opposite direction
tommy and her boys notice the commotion in the audience
they see cops pursuing someone
they realize its randolph
tommy jimmy and sammy take off after him
buggy in position again looks through the rifle scope
as the soprano reaches for an impossibly high note the fog dissipates slightly and smoochys foam rubber head comes perfectly into view
hes about to squeeze the trigger
randolph reaches the catwalk as the orchestra plays a dramatic series of smashing notes
he tackles buggy just as he squeezes off the shot
the top of smoochys foam rubber head is blown off
in slow motion smoochys tattered horn sails through the air and lands softly on the ice
everyone in the arena screams and heads for the exits
thanks to randolph buggys shot was too high and just missed sheldons skull
a confused sheldon bends over to pick up a chunk of the smoochy head
nora whos entered at the opposite end of the rink tries to reach him but its impossible
panicked audience members run across the rink heading for the exits
people slip rhinettes get trampled
randolph tries to get the rifle away from buggy
they struggle on a narrow beam high above the rink
the cops have reached the outer edge of the catwalk now
tommy and the boys get there a second later
they all stand back the catwalk is too unstable
give me that gun you fucking wacked out freak
buggy manages to shove randolph off him
he raises the rifle and shoots at the cops
randolph grabs him
both he and buggy lose their footing and slip from the catwalk
randolph is able to grab onto the edge and hold on
buggy clutches randolphs leg which threatens to bring them both down
they dangle feet above the rink
randolph desperately tries to hold onto the catwalk as buggy clings to randolphs ankle
his knuckles turn white as his fingers start to slip from the beam
still clutching randolphs ankle he starts to lose his grip
he desperately grabs randolphs foot but randolphs shoe slips off and buggy begins his long plunge to the next life
buggy screams the whole way down still holding onto randolphs shoe
buggy crashes into the middle of the rink cob webbing the ice around him
tommy and his boys runs off to find sheldon
the cops help randolph off the catwalk
hes a nervous wreck
i dont know
im kind of fucked up in general so its hard to gauge
they pat the dazed randolph on the back
he passes out
people continue to run through the rink
felled rhinettes litter the ice like broken dolls
smoke fills the air
sheldon is helping a random woman to her feet as nora finally reaches him
she embraces him
burkes with stokes
hes been in it all along
sheldon looks toward the network box
beyond it through the smoke he sees burke shoving his way through people who jam the exit trying to escape
sheldon reaches into his costume and pulls out his gun
no sheldon dont
sheldon runs off leaving nora
burke is almost through the cluster of people
he glances over his shoulder and sees sheldon heading toward him
he shoves even harder now and finally gets through
burke makes a run for it down rd street
a moment later sheldon emerges from the building
he sees burke in the distance and takes off after him
hes still in his skates and wearing the partially blown off smoochy head
burke looks behind and sees the nightmarish image of a disfigured smoochy chasing after him
he quickly rounds the corner
a few moments later sheldon rounds the corner
he looks down the street and sees no sign of burke
he notices an alley by an abandoned building
sheldon walks slowly into the alley gun drawn
suddenly burke jumps out from behind some boxes
he whacks sheldons head with a garbage can lid
the gun goes flying
burke goes for it but sheldon is quickly on his feet and pounces on him
the two men fight it out
burke manages to get on top of sheldon and starts to strangle him
you fucking point a gun at me
a gun i gave you as a gift
wheres your fucking etiquette
just as sheldon begins to lose consciousness we hear a gunshot
burke looks up
nora stands there pointing sheldons gun directly at him
let him go
burke just looks at her
before i pump one in that grecian formula scalp of yours
burke smirks as he releases sheldon
sheldon jumps up and takes the gun from nora
he shakily points it at burke
you know something kid
youve turned out to be an incredible pain in the ass
burke slowly stands up brushing off his suit
you were behind the spinner hit werent you
that was a tragic mistake
shakes head sadly if only one could turn back time
beat but what the hell its just one less mick in the world
you son of a bitch
sheldon cocks the gun
what are you gonna do
that wouldnt be very smoochy like behavior
theres just one thing
sheldon tears off the remains of his tattered costume and steps out of it
im not smoochy
sheldon is shaking as he extends the gun to burkes head
i finally realized were living in a different jungle
burke suddenly looks fearful as does nora
sheldon closes his eyes as he tries to summon up the courage to pull the trigger
suddenly theres a voice from behind
dont do it shel
sheldon turns around
its tommy and her boys
sternly stay out of it tommy
this is my business
tommy walks closer to sheldon
no more killin shel
dont destroy who you are for this piece of shit
you mean something to the kids
dont take smoochy away from the kids
tommy extends her hand for the gun
sheldon looks down at the gun
he cant believe hes even holding it
he hands it to tommy
i dont know how i got pushed this far
youre only human shel
the important thing is
you never went over the cliff
youre a good boy
for some of us
its too late
tommy pats sheldons shoulder affectionately
well take it from here kid you run along with your girl
get on with your life
sheldon looks over at burke whos petrified
tommy youre not going to dont worry
sometimes even a rat deserves a little mercy
sheldon and nora take a final look at burke before walking out of the alley
burke is wide eyed with fear as tommys boys advance on him
just as they round the corner there is the sound of two gunshots
sheldon looks at nora
she pats him on the back
stokes finally makes it out of the arena
he runs toward his waiting limo and hops in the back seat
he barks to his driver through the glass partition
get out of here
the car doesnt move
stokes pounds on the partition
move this thing
stokes frantically pushes the button that lowers the partition
it slides down
are you deaf
i said the driver turns around
stokes recoils in horror
he smiles as the back doors open and the japanese thugs chick sambo and tobi pile in with stokes
they slam the doors shut
i wish i could tell you itll be quick and painless frank but you know how these things go
stokes lets out a small whimper
chick nods to takashi who steps on the gas as he sings anything goes in japanese
the car heads into the night passing sheldon and nora who have exited the alley
this will be frank stokes final limo ride
sheldon and nora pause on the street
sheldon looks around him
you know a little grime here and there doesnt change the fact
its still a beautiful city
he looks at nora
lets go home smoochy
sheldon gazes back at her
no its not
its just beginning
they kiss passionately as music swells and the camera cranes high above the rink
the garden is sold out
the lights go down
through the p
it gives us great pleasure to introduce americas favorite rhino
ladies and gentlemen
boys and girls
theres a dramatic pause tympany roll
smoochy skates out to thunderous applause
with his partner and comrade
the one the only
randolph skates out somewhat shakily to huge applause
sheldon puts his arm around him
the audience is now on their feet
randolph especially basks in the adulation
all proceeds from tonights performance will benefit the rainbow randolph center for alcoholism and delusional behavior
sheldon pats randolph on the back
music begins as rhinettes and krinkle kids skate out
the show starts and the audience goes wild
nora smiles from the stands as smoochy and the others glide across the ice
