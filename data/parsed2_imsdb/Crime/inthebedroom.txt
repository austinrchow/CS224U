written by rob festinger todd field we are in the midst of a field of tall grass wild flowers
a long rutted road stretches into the distance
faintly at first and then closer we hear a woman squealing with laughter
we see her legs cut through the grass and fly up a hill
close on her heels is a young man a good ten years younger in hot pursuit
over the field across the tops of blades sits an ancient apple tree
we rise out of the grass and see the two young people under the tree
they are entwined in a deep embrace
we see them in glimpses their eyes lips hands finally they part the woman rests her head on his chest
she reaches out and strokes his hand
he stares at their fingers mingling together
the woman sighs
i love it here
i know you do
i can feel my life ya know
he stares up into the boughs above him and shd
a legend appears il the sound of ballgame over a blue chew pick up winds around a corner and disappears down a long stretch of road
and thats it from fenway the final score oakland t redsox
you have been listening to the re broadcast of last nights game
this broadcast is the sole property of r league baseball and cannot be the truck pulls onto a small road flanked by rows of year old clapboard two story affairs
on the lawn in front of one of them is the woman from the opening scene natalie strut prett eautifl actually with a little more sleep
she stands wit two small boys who are doing their best to stay warm in the morning air
her son jason and his brother duncan who has his face buried in his mothers coat refusing to see or be seen
the truck comes to a stop and two men get out
one is young early s and even at this hour his step is lively his face full of warmth
he walks over to natalie and gives her a kiss
the young man from the opening scene rrank fowler
the other man leans back against the passenger door
he is in his early s
kind face good looking athletic in his day franks father matt
he smiles at natalie
natalie smiles back
how you doing boys
jason starts for the truck
matt opens the door and the boy climbs inside the cab
frank kneels down to duncan
you upset that youre not coming
frank reaches out and puts his hand on the boys shoulder
duncan pulls away
frank looks up to natalie for help
he can come if he wants
we can manage really
she smiles and shakes her head
he wants to stay here
dont worry dunk
you can come next time
qy natalie kisses him and theyre off
jason in the middle
he glances over to frank a trace of hero worship in his face
sardines are processed at lightening speed
we follow them on their journey which ends with the sealed cans being packed into cardboard shipping boxes
they are taped shut by a young man we will meet later tim
the tops read strout sons
a double gallon drum wood stove is humping
several men turn their bodies rotisserie fashion around the thing while making morning small talk the starting price of lobsters the prospect of repairs to their equipment and so on
a scarred hand scribbles some figures on a wall that has been used as a scratch pad for years
two scales are emptied of red fish into a plastic pickle bucket
a pair of canvas tennis shoes shuffle down a gangway
the bucket sways directly over them
a small hand struggles with the weight of the thing
a pair of beacon falls waders appear the shoes stop
a strong hand grabs hold of the handle the shoes pick up the pace
matt frank prepare the rig
jason stands on the dock taking it all in
a field of lobster pots stacked like cordwood and surrounded by a collection of scarred buoys grapnel and coiled fishing gear stiff with sea salt all so wildly unreasonable as
to seem exotic
jasons eyes find the hull of gigi an old boudreau built lobsterboat
starboard side covered in barnacles
cmon up jace
hold on a second
need to know if hes ready first jason can you tell me whats important
on tell h a shaft of sunlight at the end of a dark afternoon a note in music he takes a breath
and the way the back of a babys neck smells if its mother keeps it tidy
you taught h well
come aboard sailor
matt reaches down to give a hand up
frank turns the engine over
it roars to life
the sun is fast climbing into the morning sky as gigi glides out of the channel and past a lighthouse that sits just off the point of a good sized
jason shields his eyes with his hand
he gazes out at the island
matt comes up beside him and sticks a baseball cap onto his head
the crown reads u
ever been over there
isnt an island anymore though
its a city
they have electric lights
artesian wells even a jail lighthouse isnt manned anymore its run by a computer when i lived there had no ferry then so we didnt even have cars can you
howd you get back
off the island
matt smiles at the memory
then we got a little outboard
that was great
a seven and a half horsepower it was we lived there until i was about your age then we left and became harbor people
jason seems to be digesting this
i a harbor person
matt hides a smile about to form
yep jason we all are
jason is full of questions
matt knows the answers and doesnt talk down to him
something the boy is grateful for
at the helm
his eye s inted from glare and cold
he cuts back on the throttle s and heads for the winch
gloved hands pull up a blue green buoy and slide the manila line into the winch
a pot surfaces and frank sets it doors up on the edge
he opens the doors
his hands work quickly and efficiently
he tosses a small crab back into the water pulls out a lobster and measures the back
then a nice sized lobster is pulled out its missing the scissor claw
he hands it to matt
baits the trap
throws the winch and the next pot surfaces
matt sits inside jason on his lap
he reaches into a wooden box of rubber bands with a banding wrench and bands the crustaceans remaining cruncher claw
jason stares at the disfigured creature
oh boy you see what happened to this poor fel ow
well the trap has nylon nets called heads side heads at b ends so the lobster can crawl in
the bedroom head inside holds the bait and keeps it from escaping you know the old saying twos company three s a crowd
well its like that
you get more than two in a bedroom and chances are something like this is going to happen
thats why frank cant leave these traps for more than a day
matt holds up another lobster and turns it belly up
there are black balls on both sides of the tail
now the older females like this of gal are the most dan erous especially when theyre growin eyries
one of these can take out two males easy then you wind up with lobster you cant sell and as for this fine lady she gets off easy the state
says you have to let her go
matt throws her back in the water
holds up the other one to jason
can you handle this
he really isnt
matt hands it to him
go ahead now put it in the tank
jason cant get the thing in the tank fast enough
looking around you see a big yard double lot
the grass is manicured to per ection someone takes a lot of pride in their garden
in the middle of this sits a two story cape post hopper wyeth early th century simple beautiful d you ont freeze in the winter
the truck backs up into the driveway frank j s out drops the gate
resting on the bed is a large box wit a line drawing of a swing set
hey dad can you give me a hand
the transistorized sounds of a baseball qame
frank pushes duncan who sits proudly on his new swing set
small children are everywhere
a serious super soaker squirt gun fight in progress
a steaming hot grill with a huge assortment of hot dogs burgers
a spatula flips a patty
the sounds of fenwav park emanate from a chea dort able radio
willis grinnel early s a stout silver haired man works the grill
standing next to him is matt his best friend for forty plus years
matt takes a pull off a can of moxie
sets it down and searches through a plastic bread bag
willis looks past him distracted
h ruth hates this kind
i bought the wrong buns
maybe we can borrow hers
matt follows williss gaze to the object of his distraction a pretty woman in tight denim shorts
she s bent over to wipe the ketchup stained face of jason hes wearing matts cap
ah what i would give to have back my youth
willis you never had that in your youth
the woman turns around and catches willis staring
willis looks down nonchalantly rifling through the bun bag
matt waves to a passing man in khaki shorts father oberti father
you made it
hey if i dont see you fellas here i dont get to see you at all
he backwards hugs natalie
you want a beer
i think ill see if your mom needs any help
she laughs he grabs and tickles her but she breaks away and escapes inside the house
matt watches on and falls into a wistful daydream
matt turns to him and to williss surprise ever so slightly nods
natalie walks in through the living room pausing to examine a half finished architectural model that sits on a card table next to a jigsaw puzzle
she looks toward the kitchen where a woman works at the sink
she takes a breath and starts there
frank reaches into an old westinghouse refrigerator
he pulls out a case of schaeffers and a six pack of moxie
he loads it all into a metal tub filled with ice
frank hunched over as he works loo
ip at tim bryson still in his work clothes he wears a white soiled smock
a patch on his right pocket says strout sons
over the left sply tim
a hair net nests on his head
thanks for coming by
wooo is that new cologne
you really oughta take a shower when you leave that place
take off that head dress chief and give me a hand
tim reaches up and pulls the hair net off his head
tim and frank lug the heavy cooler around the house heading toward the backyard
strout mentioned you again
i bet he did
he still talks about you coming back
says youre the best can packer he ever had
he always was a nice guy
are we there yet
tim and frank emerge from the side of the house
willis cuts them off grabs two beers
excuse me boys an offering
he throws one to father oberti who sits talking with williss wife katie grinnel s she is tal ing the priests ear off
becky went to the hairdressing academy after high school but aft she got married and had the boys she decided she wanted to stay home she still loves doing hair
where do you go father
i just go to super cuts
you cant request the same girl at super cuts you have to take what you can get
they dont know your hair how can you get a good cut i they dont know the air
father oberti has the patience of
well of a priest
ruth fowler attractive is washing and arranging vegetables on a plate
natalie chops carrots on a cutting board
they barely make eye contact
natalie attempts small talk
can you hand me that bowl dear
im looking forward to the concert on labor day
the music is so
unusual haunting really
ruth keeps chopping
natalie chooses her words carefully
how did you learn about that particular style
at faro y thesis was on eastern european
natalies lips tighten uncomfortably
the topic seems to int date
i thought o becoming a teacher
why didnt you
the answer to ruths question duncan wanders in
his cheeks as big as dizzy gillespies
what are you eating
duncans mouth is so full he can hardly speak
the two regard each other how is it
he tugs on her shirt
swing me swing me
okay okay dunk
she gets dragged out of the kitchen
the screen door slams
ruth finishes arranging the plate
matt enters and starts opening up the cupboards loo king for something
he squats down burrowing into a cabinet
it was nice of you to invite the boys
she hasnt brought them before because shes embarrassed
she shouldnt be embarrassed
matt looks up from the floor
nice view from down here
she ignores him but smiles
is hunched over with his arms gentl wrapped around jason coaching him on the finer points of kitting
while tim pitches
there you go
good hands up higher
be your knees duncan is being pushed by natalie ruth watches from the kitchen window
match cut ruth staring out the window
i dont know why you had to put that monstrosity up
youre just going to have to take it apart when they leave
matt rises a bottle of lighter fluid in hand
cmon ruth hes a kid
what did you expect
happy birthday heres a box
why dont you drag it around for a while
he s a kid
he wants it now
something across the yard catches her attention
matt exits the house
duncan jumps off his swing and sprints
who has just arrived
he stays at the far end of the yard
duncan does a running jump into his fathers arms
frank with jason looks up
jason sees his father
he doesnt move
natalie walks over to frank they exchange glances
shedgrabs his hand
straining to appear casual traverses the richard play boxes duncan
duncan looks up at his mother
daddvs takino us to the arcade
richard eating duncans hot dog rises to meet natalie and jason
hey there buddy

i told you held come uttface jason reaches over and whacks duncan on the head
hey jason dont do that to your brother

he probably has
jason backs away
frank makes his way over to natalie
matt watches on absently flipping burgers
ruth comes over to h ruth shakes her head
richard frank and natalie are talking but there are long pauses between words
tim wanders over and says something to richard finally richard smiles turns and exits
jason playfully chases duncan across the yard
frank and natalie stay behind talking quietly
matt takes a breath and exhales
he turns to ruth with a comforting smile but shes just entering the house
the screen door closes behind her
ruth is at the counter pouring dressing onto a salad
frank comes up behind her and hugs her
thanks for doing this mom
are you alright
natalie and i want to take you and dad out tonight
oh thats very sweet dear but we already have plans
you going over to the grinnels
ruth shakes her head
your fathers taking me to the strand
oh what are you seeing
the first film we ever saw together
matt ruth sit watching barry l don
the duel between barry lord bullingdon is on screen
bullingdons pistol misfires
sir richard this pistol must be faulty i must have another
im sorry lord bullingdon but you must first stand your ground and allow mr
lyndon his turn to fire
that is correct lord bullingdon your pistol has fired and that counts as your shot mr
lyndon are the rules of firing clear to you
lord bullingdon are you rsdy to receive mr lyndons fire
o yes very well then mr
lyndon cock your pistol and prepare to fire
bullingdon is overwrought
he looks like he may vomit
ruth leans over to matt
ruth gets out of her seat
matt looking confused follows
ruth heads out the doors with matt on her heels
i dont remember it being so tragic
o h h always felt sorry for barry
no i mean it maybe i relate to him
what are you talking about
well we both married above our station
dont start that again
he takes her in his arms and kisses her
looks into her eyes
he buries his face in her hair
i love you
i know ruth sits at her bureau facing the mirror
she be ins a nightly ritual of removing the pins from her hair once ma e from the shells of tortoises and now the plastics of dupont
matt lies in bed reading
he lowers his book and watches her brush her tresses with on y delicious strokes
she sets down her bsh and turns
matt ooks back to his book
she climbs into bed next to him
shes not divorced yet
its the same thing
maine has crazy laws thats all
he likes the boys
you dont think hes thinking about no
hes not going to marry her
then whats he doing with her
she probably loves him ruth
girls always have
why cant we just leave it at that
he wont listen to me
i asked him three times to dismantle that swing set
oh let it stay up
looks like a young couple lives here
he needs his head in school
not in her
so to speak
ruth pinches his shoulder
it would help if you were my side
ill get on your side
she laughs and pushes him away
a small waiting room with an alcove reception
rockwell prints adorn the walls a long table covered with dog eared periodicals rests in front of a couch that has seen better days
adamson s glances over at her husband elwyn s who vacantly thumbs through a highlights magazine
he pauses to catch up on the latest exploits of goofus gallant
the nurse janelle s calls out from the alcove
elwyn sits bare chested on a table
matt finishes bandaging his elbow then listens to his chest with a stethoscope
he is careful and thoughtful
alma looks to him
you can put your shirt back on now
alma stands and helps her husband dress
yesterday he was up and around all afternoon but toda he tumbled
hes fallen down twice
have all i can do to get him up
hes weak and the longer you lay in bed the weaker you get
elwyn you need to do those exercises you promised me twice a day
i know you miss the work important

for a while hed sit and just mend on nets but he cant do that anymore
speaks with difficulty hows your dad matt
im sorry dr
now elwyn you remember jesse fowler passed on somi ime back we were at the funeral
hes heard this before
sometimes he feels more like a mechanic than a doctor working on old cars with parts that have long been discontinued
he nods sympathetically
matt pulls on his jacket
he passes janelle in the hallway as he heads for the back door
ill be back in an hour
forgot my lunch
starting to become a habit
i can get you something from williss
hes already out the door
matt trots down the gangway and up to where the gigi is moored
he looks in
no sign of frank
a voice booms from a new ft
jonesporter it belongs to henry ozar s
just missed him matt he went home for lunch today
i forgot hes got that interview
calls up the stairs
matt turns around and sees frank frank
what are you doin
thought you were driving to boston for t at interview
rank slowly nos
his clothes are rumpled
yeah he we rescheduled
natalie walks out from a room in the hall
she combs her hair through with her fingers but her skirt on backwards is somewhat of a giveaway
frank rolls his eyes
hi where are the boys
with my mom
oh like coleslaw
matt sits across from natalie and frank
sandwiches iced tea and coleslaw are laid out
frank looks to matt for some kind of acknowledgement of his lunch te activities
matt seems more interested in the slaw
frank is sandwiched between matt and ruth
they are surrounded by dozens of young parents
ruth doesnt look too tilled to be here
wave you guys
matt and ruth follows franks gaze to natalie has her hands full adjusting jasons uniform while duncan clings to her
she is waving up to the fowlers amidst the chaos
the fowlers wave back
matt s suddenly inspired
he leans in past ruth to frank
did you tell your mom how good it was
how good what was
frank had quite a time this afternoon loved your coleslaw
ate enough for two
thats what its there for
frank leans back behind ruth to give his father the evil eye
he gets a grin from matt for his trouble
ruth almost catches it
matt rises shuffles past ruth and frank whom he gives a firm pat on the knee
ill take one
ruth puts her arm around frank
re duncan and jason so how are the kids
franks caught off guard
he shakes his head
howd your interview go
ruth watches natalie below
shes such a brave girl
you re driving e nuts ma
ive had lots of girlfriends
i dont understand why this one is any different
i know you dont
were not serious mom
its a summer thing
she would like to believe him
natalie drives down emerson road
as she approaches her house she sees a brown suburban sitting in her driveway
she looks confused
natalie enters with groceries
richard is seated at the kitchen table
hes finishing the first half of a sandwich
he drains a glass of milk
natalie sets her purse down on the counter and starts cleaning up his mess
howd you g et in this time
she takes the carton of milk that richard no doubt left out
she pours the final drops into his glass thank you
she throws the carton out
she takes a seat and stares at him like a teacher counselling a troubled youth
what can i help you with
he kicks back the last of the milk wipes his mouth
i was just dropping that off for jason
he points to a baseball trophy sitting on top of the microwave
inscription bears his name and rockland high school regional championship
i didnt know where youd want to put it
it was about time he got it
what am i going to do with it
richards wistful gaze stays locked on the trophy
for a moment natalies and slips away
i think it will mean a lot to him richard
hes really been improving lately
a sharp turn so ive heard
it would have been nice if youd come to his game
i just got your message
where are t with him
thats none of your business
theyre my kids but theyre none of my business
you know what i mean
richard presses his fingers to his eyes
he takes a long heavy breath
i i was thinking about moving back
with you and the boys
what are you talking about
what i talking about
im talking about moving back thats what im talking about i know what youre thinking but its different now
hows the job
your father t ake you back on at the cannery

she ignores him ya see my new rig out there
natalie looks annoyed
yeah its real nice

jesus you dont change do you
no i dont change
everything around me changes

its not your house
nat i o

who was it that answered your phone t e other morning
i dont care
really you can just stop now
its not working
he takes a breath
i just want
to fool them for a few days into thinking they have a real father and then its back to cutting her off i their father
you know what defines a father
its what he does not what he promises
its being a positive consistent presence
richard eyes her suspiciously
mimicking her positive consistent presence
what does that mean
i just dont get it
but im not fucking a college boy am i
can you just go now
i really dont want you here when they get back
oh no wouldnt want that
he doesnt budge
you have to leave
finally as if struck b some small discove
richard places his large hands on the kitchen table and pus es himself up
he heads past natalie without looking back
he closes the door firmly be ind him
franks truck parked out front the lawn is littered with the boys various plastic weapons a small wading pool
a childrens television show is heard from inside
natalie is sprawled out on a chaise lounge nursing a beer and sharing a cigarette with frank who is on his hands knees finishing an elaborte structure with a set
of froebel wooden blocks
you know ive been ignoring our difference in age but if you keep playing with those blocks im gonna start to worry
theyre not blocks theyre gifts
im sorry i know theyre a gift and a very generous one
im gust concerned that dunk
might think es a little old to be playing with them
theyre not for playing theyre to learn about unity balance
froebel called them gifts
this is the second gift a sphere a cube and a cylinder
a five year old can learn the difference in form depending on how they look at them
why didnt he say so in the first place
oh ou said second gift
how many are are there
youve been pla in with these excuse me working wit t ese for how long
since i was about dunks age
my mom took me tough all twenty
so thats what a good mother does
come on down here and take a look
she sets down her beer and joins him
the small wooden structure looks like a home that could have been built by lautner or wright frank looks pleased
natalie is distracted
your mother gave you these frank i feel funny duncan having them
dont be silly it was her idea
youre not looking at the house look
its not all mine its part mack
frank speaks excitedly as he makes a quick sketch on a colored piece of construction paper using one of the boys markers
see the whole ideal of what mack was trying to achieve was a common area in the middle of the house
i mean a large common space wasnt uni e to mack but the idea of separating the family so that the kids were on one side and the parents on
the other so they would all spill into the center
he looks over to natalie checking in
she smiles and shifts her gaze
im boring you arent i
no not at all i was just
school id rather talk about our house
i know you would
what if i wait a year
a years not going to make a difference
you cant do that frank
ive thought a lot about this
but you told me it takes forever just to establish yourself
exactl so whats a year in forever
know w at duncan said today
she cant suppress a smile
you wouldnt be changing the subject would you
he said frank i dont think jason really understands girls
what did you say
i said give him time duncan
they both break up
i didnt know what to say
if this is how he is now boy are we in trouble he stops short
the word we hangs in the air
they watch each other unsure of how to react
changing the subject quickly
frank reaches down to the grass and comes up with one of duncans toys
a real musclebound superhero
reading the tag richard gave it to dunk for his birthday
frank sets it down
the headlights of approaching car rake across action half a dozen girls age to are gathered in ruths classroom
desks and chairs are stacked up for summer recess
the girls are in shorts and t shirts one with a picture of the solar system and another with the pink panther
bri ht bathing suit straps are visible around some of their nec s this afternoon they were sw ng
a few look sleepy enough to be in bed already
ruth stands with her arms up keeping time and controlling the dynamics
a single girl sings the drone a low monotone one hears underneath the other voices
they sing the balkan folk song oj savice
oh sava carry me across our quiet cool water
there is my dear village and in that village the prettiest girl
without embarrassment they shriek they drone and at their ease they whistle
the music transports these girls who are normally pre occupied with images of mtv and brad pitt to a place of pure self
the song ends
that was really good
ok its we should stop
the girls gather up their things quickly
remember when you sing these words the way we feel about the harbor is how the balkans felt about the river sava
the girls start out of the room
listen to your tapes moilih tan is still very rough and weve of a minute program to get ready by labor day
she starts to put her purse down when matt kneeling in front of the reclining chair
its back is to her
just hold still
ruth drops her purse and quickly comes around the recliner
something stops her
oh my god
matt holds franks jaw
he gently turns his face toward the lamp
frank has stitches over his right eye
the blood under the white of the pupil oozing
both lips are bright and swollen
come on frank
ruth hovers in shock
this was her husband wasnt it
frank nods wearily
ex he dropped in
he takes the compress from matt and gingerly applies it to his forehead
whats to stop him from doing it again
did you hit him at all
tell me you hit him
enough so he wont want to next time
i dont think i touched him
matt pulls up the skin around the bloody eye
ruth stares at the hospital band around franks wrist
so what are you going to do
thats not the problem
you know you like her
i like a lot of people
what about the boys
did they see it
they were asleep
did you leave her alone with him
he left first
she was yelling at ham
i believe she had a skillet in her hand
oh for gods sake
did you call the police
you didnt call them
when was i going to call the police ruth
he just got in
ruth scans the room
wheres the phone
hold on a second calm down
lets just talk about this
now the copsll go to her place first and itll scare the hell out of the kids
we have to call them frank
it wasnt that serious
just like the relationship isnt serious
ruth this is not the time
well when is the time
after he knocks him into a coma
this is stopping
come fall youre on a plane
are you taking them with you
how do you think the boys will feel when you disappear
this isnt just some sweetie from vassar that youll see on holidays frank
youre not in this alone
frank rises and leaves the room
the sooner you end this thing the better
she returns to matt who is leaning against the recliner chin in hand deep in thought
what are we going to do
i dont know
youve got to talk to him
i dont ow
i think hes right about scaring the kids
why dont we call it a night
well deal with it tomorrow
matt are you going to call the police or do i have to
s bd me what i think
if you want to call them
ruth looks at him stupefied
without warning ruth leaves and goes upstairs
ruth lies on her side reading
matt comes in from the hallway
he stares at her
she ignores him
finally she turns over and faces him
its not the first time shes played around
matt seems relieved that shes talking to him
he sits on the bed and starts taking off his shoes
shes not with the guy anymore
i mean from before
what are you talking about
oh come on youve heard the same things i have
i think you forget
i dont take my lunch in the teachers lounge maybe he still loves her
matt looks from ruth out the bedroom door and into the hallway
he sees frank rounding the top of the stairs
he gets up and closes the bedroom door
frank enters the room pulls off his t shirt and drops it on the floor
he walks over and faces a wall mirror
he seems nonplussed by what he sees
henry czar sits holding court with jason frank whose facial bruises have all but healed the stitches replaced by a butterfly bandage
they eat cod tongues and cheeks
drink soda pop from bottles
best part of the cod but most outsi ers they wont touch it
the shack is too warm and smells of cordage and paint spilled beer and male sweat
jason is in heaven
the summer fishermen the part timers like frank here get in your hair
theres as many as of em with licenses now should put up a sign fish your own backyard or lose your traps frank smiles at jason
a lobster is simple enough jason
but if the guy going after him is even simpler well he might as well give up
dont hurt my feelings any
easy to talk try fishing in the winter cold as hell below no matter go go go youve gotta go
you want your bread flour you gotta goo henrys just sore cause i catch twice as much as he does with an old second hand boudreau
dont you listen to him son that boat is fine
she was my first
takes a sip of pop
kinda miss her sometimes and that truck youre driving
when you headed back to school frank
for some reason this strikes both of them as funny and they crack up
not jason he seems concerned by the question
frank sees this
jason heads off down the pier on his bicycle
he passes matto hi dr
fowler matt waves
frank is hosing down the hull as matt makes his way down the gangway
whatd you pull
frank glances up then continues with his work
not too bad about forty pounds
havent caught sight of you in days
you know where to find me
when you coming home
frank turns off the spigot
has it come to this
he jumps back into the boat and retrieves the bait bucket
come to what
frank hops back onto the dock and sets down the container
you having to run errands for mom
matt ignores the jibe
frank starts stacking holding crates
im thinking of building a couple hundred more traps see if i can do better than break even
matt doesnt comment
he picks up a crate and throws it up top
itll take you two years to get a licence to fish off season
unless henry takes me on as his ster an
q they continue stacking
you think hed do that
its as good a life as any
good enough for your father sometimes things skip a generation
trying to sta calm cmon frank you ow ycu need something more
so i can have an ivy lea e education like you
christ i its so great how come you sneak out of that office everyday to come down here
i like spending time with my son
frank lugs up the last container and takes a seat on the stack
hes worn out takes a breather
frank shakes his head
i dont know dad i dont know
matt takes a seat next to him
shes a wonderful girl
i see that
frank looks lost
the silence is broken by a loud voice
franks how lon you gonna be parked there id like to un oad
the two of them regard each other
give me a hand
ruth comes down the stairs wrapping her bathrobe around her the dining room light is on
frank sits at the t lea his drafting tools are out
hes fully immersed in a sketch
ruth enters quietly
your father is snoring

she takes a container from the fridgge smells it makes a quenstioning face then puts it back grabs another container and opens a cupboard
pulls out a loaf of bread
she quietly places a sandwich in front of him and takes a seat

ruth sits there awkwardly

shes a frank finally puts down his pencil and looks at her youre not reall going to have this conversation wit me now ma
frank returns to his work
he doesnt look up again
she leaves the food for him
like a zoo keeper
frank hauls traps
he appears lethargic dull the hands a little slower
the eyes tired
the joy of the work replaced by dread
hen sits alone at the wooden table
there are three plates of cod and soda pops
frank comes in exhausted
henry looks up
youre nnin late
takes a seat and starts in on the cod
henry looks at the empty seat next to frank
wheres our boy
frank ignores the question
traps stacked in the bed
he slows down to gaze out his window as he passes the truck crawls to a stop
he takes the moment storin each detail folded up lounge chairs
scattered toys on t e porch
a tipped over tricyle
he idles as if waiting for someone
after one last look he drives off
grinnel house basement e
g the sightsand sounds of men gathered around a poker table
a regular game
everyone well into their umpteenth beer with the exception of matt who nurses a can o moxien matt frowns at his hand
he glances over to frank r also at the table
frank stares at his cards but his nd is elsewhere
you cant hypnotize the cards into changing matt
late s peers above his readin glasses
he is a lobster man by trade but fancies himself a poet
for christs sake bet or you know carls gonna start
carl is indeed
the be gars do and widows cat feed them an thou wi t grow fat
the gnat that sings his s ers song collective groans
poison gets from slanders tongue
the poison of the snake and newt is the sweat of envys foot
the poison of the honey bee

matt throws his two bucks in
carl youve really got to get off this blake thing

the place breaks up with laughter

more groans as frank pulls in his winnings

the game continues
frank walks down the hallwaytalking on a cordless phone
his tone casual but serious
he jots down notes in a sketch book
i get in on the sixth

the house looks like a storm hit it chairs tipped over toys scattered papers strewn across the floor
frank looks around the room
natalie her hair atangled mess her face streaked from tears paces nervously

jason looks down from the window
he sees richards suburban pull up front
natalie gives a horrified look to frank

natalie hustles the boys upstairs
frank moves to the front door
hes about to check the doorknob when the doorknob jiggles from the other side
richard just get away fr here silence
frank turns his eyes lock on frank races across the living room just as the door flies richard
eves burning marches in
the boys huddle around natalie
duncan is wailing jason looks terrified nat ie strains to hear natalie starts to the door listen kids stay here
d c wont let go of her sleeve
he starts to move with her
i said stay here
he lets go and jason takes him up in his small arms
its ok dunk
mommys coming back
natalie hesitates then heads out the door
we move with her out the bedroom to the she slowly steps down the stairs
she moves quickly down the stairs
cautiously she looks over the landing
from above richard stands his back to her his head hung
in his hand
a mm pistol
natalie lets out a plaintive wail
emotionless richard turns to her looks down at the floor then starts toward the kitchen
natalie races down the steps and stops
shes paralyzed a scream trapped somewhere inside
she turns away
richard sits at the kitchen table
the gun rests in front of him
his right sleeve splattered with franks blood
atts face appears distorted behind the surface
he lowers what we now see to be x
ray and kills the light
he hesitates presses the blinking hold button picks up the receiver
the blood drains from his face
matt stands in the hallway outside of the auditorium that is ruths classroom
a banner across the hall reads have a the choir finishes the last strains
ruth is happy the rehearsal has gone well
she smiles in a way that expresses the simple joy she will never know again
the girls gather their things and start out laughing and running after each other
matt stands in the hallway as they rush past
franks casket is lowered into the ground
a large gathering of relatives and friends stand before father oberti as he finishes the eulogy
matts arm is tightly interlocked with ruths beneath her eyes swelling from three days of suffering
their hands c enched to ether make one fist both parents keeping the other uprig t
the rain glides down their faces mixing easily with tears
matt steps up to franks open grave
the gathering watches as matt peers down into the hole silently speaking to it
he reaches down grabs a fistful of dirt
then tosses it into the open grave
matt pauses staring down into the hole he steps back as father oberti delivers the end of his eulogy
matt looks blankly around noticing the familys many friends includin carl and henry from the game willis and katie and franks friend t matts eyes linger on someone behind t
a lone female figure in black away from the crowd
their eyes meet
matt almost imperceptibly nods
a large casserole is placed on a long table with many assorted dishes
a hand reaches in scoops up some of the casserole onto a small plate and carries it to standing in the middle of a much larger gathering the reception after
matt stands in the downstairs hallway
he looks around the room as if it is all a dream
children getting soda pop
others in conversation
the odd person looks up at him then turns away
willis steps up to matt
his wife katie stands nearby
matt doesnt seem to notice willis
willis puts a gentle hand on his friends arm
can i get you anything
matt suddenly looks up at them as if confused
ere s rut h
she went to lie down matt
he turns d heads upstairs
willis and katie watch him go
matt approaches their bedroom
the door is a he steps in to ruth who is on the bed
her back is to him a arently sleeping
crumbled tissues litter the bed the f oor matt ietl moves to her
he reaches down about to touch her head
something stops h he turns and leaves
franks room is facing him
instinctively he goes to open the door then pauses
matt slowly enters
he looks around as if freezing the room in his memory
the place is untouched
franks many sketches are still pinned to the wall
some clothes lie scattered on the floor
his fishing cap
matt starts to pick up
he takes franks clothes from the floor and places them on his bed
he looks at a dirty t shirt in his hand
he brings it to his face
he inhales deeply able to smell his sons lingering scent finally he sets the shirt on the bed
strays near franks drafting table he reaches out touching the table grazingthe topogra h of scattered pencils drawings strewn across it the froe e gifts
he takes a seat at the table
feeling its frame the sketches the seat below and without warning he is overcome
he lurches forward burying his face in his hands
the sobs come unrestrained violently like a sudden tidal wave
a laugh track fills the air
ruth in pajamas and bathrobe watches a stand up comic on tv
she sips tea from a mug
matt appears at the door kettle in hand
ruth looks up and nods
matt stands atop a ladder underneath a large maple he struggles with a pair of pruning shears
at war with a large br c the branch seems to be winning
ruth still dressed in her robe pads down the hallway
stops to glance out the window at natt working
ruth stands transfixed
reflected in the window pane below quj glimpses through branches of a small boy scampering up a tree
flashes of arms legs a smile
we can make out the giggles of the child but they are distorted wobbly as if deteriorated by memory
the tree shudders as the boy climbs higher
okay watch it now frank
frank listen to your father
thats high enough
the tree continues shaking
ruth allows the memory then turns back and pads back down the hallway
matt sits behind his desk catching up on some paperwork
janelle appears in the doorway
im going to lunch dr
fowler alright she continues smiling as though ting to extend her tenderness
matt avoids eye contact
matt looks relieved
willis opened this place after serving as a chief petty officer in the vietnam war
the theme if there is one is definitely nautical
snapshots of longtime customers are stapled on the walls between the booths and tables two are framed and prominent
they are from willis days the first an entry photo of a young willis front of the ha f
the second a sun faded color photo of att and willis
both ook to be in their twenties both dressed in navy whites
the trade here is mostly ve early breakfast and then lunch for the men who work at the leather and shoe factories
a muted news show plays on a ceiling at the far end of the booths
a sign on the wall reads t your forget about lunch breakfast
willis carries over two plates with omelettes parks them on the table and takes a seat across from matt
dont worry i didnt make em
matt takes a bite
oh thats mine
he switches plates
matt takes another bite

matt glances at an old clipping from the boston globe stapled to the wall
its a photo from the redsox dream to petrocelli yaztrems i and reggie smith each hold u two fingers they are s ling after hitting consecutive omeruns

matt shifts the focus to his omelette
you have any tabasco sauce
he looks around ca out to the kitc hen
he heads to the back
matt looks out the window
a refrigera ted truck with the strout logo on its side pulls to a stop at the light
willis returns with sauce in hand
he takes a seat
shifts his tone again
next weekend matt we really want you to come up to the c p katies insisting
not to pressure you or anything
but if you dont come ses going to invite her sister and that idiot and i know im going to wind up insulting him again
matt considers this
the future of my family is in your hands
let me ask ruth
you know your seat is getting cold at the game
we have carls kid subbing for you
not that we mind he loses every time but wed rather take your money
matt stares aimlessly out the window
willis goes back to his eggs
both men comfortable enough with each other to be silent
hows ruth doing
her car broke down
the phone continues to ring
then sto s ruth lies on the couc dressed in her robe
her hair looks neglected
she stares at the television
ad for su ay chevrolet comes on the screen a testimonial from a bald man saying the best thing about the sales people is theyre not pushy
a large graphic nla s over the an s face not pushy we hear a c ul into t e driveway
ruth doesnt eem to notice
ad or a long term residential nursing retirement center
ruth looks interested
the front door opens and matt comes in with groceries
not looking up how was your day
matt carries the bags into the kitchen
saw willis my day was fine too thanks
matt comes out of the kitchen
how was your day
tried calling thought you might have gone out
the grinnels invited us up to the camp next weekend

he turns a little surprised
we dont have to
she looks up at him
you dont want to go
no i want to great
tell them yes
i thoug t you might be busy getting the girls ready
shes back into her show
the sink still has the plates and cups from breakfast
matt starts to clean u reaching for a dishrag on the counter he notices the blinking o the answering machine
there are a half dozen messages
he hits play
he finds th ol e
fowler this is regina at the district attorneys office mr
davis would like to speak with you both just as soon as possible
a windowless rotunda
judge william wilkenson presides
strout has been in the custodyof the knox county sherrifs department since august second held without bail
the court is obliged to hold a bail hearing within two weeks of incarceration which is the purpose of our procedings here today
given the schedule considerations on this docket the court feels that we should conduct the probable cause hearing in tandem
witnesses will be called at this time
unless there are any objections to the contrary this court will recess until p
natalie comes up the brick walk and enters the building
a gray concrete room washed out by the buzzing overhead florescent
matt and ruth sit on metal fold out chairs alongside twenty or so spectators and a smattering of reporters in the gallery
richard unkempt and dressed in an orange jumpsuit sits patientiy next to one of his two attorneys
matt and ruth glance over at nathan strout sitting directly behind richard
nathans two other sons both big men like richard sit at his side
nathan feels the fowlers stares
his eyes stay focused on the front of the room
richards trial attorney marla s s smart expensive and a long way from her home in boston stands in the court well
natalie strout in the witness box
fowler had asked you to go upstairs with your chil
z s your husband was trying to enter
district attorney william davis rises
strouts police interview is already documented the defense has a copy of it
theres no reason to waste anymore of the courts time
your honor we just want to review exactly what s
strout saw on the afternoon of july th
isnt that why were here
the judge nods
natalie tries to recapture her place
so you were bringing your children up to their bedroom
natalies glance wanders to the gallery to matt and ruth
she sits on her hands to keep them from shaking
i was in jason and dunks room i didnt know what was happening downstairs
i was getting worried
i asked jason to read dunk a story
he didnt want a story he wanted to come with me
so i sat him back down on the bunk and i left them in the room
you left them
she starts to cry
of course im sorry
i closed the door
i moved down the hall
i looked back to make sure they werent behind me
i had just started down the stairs when i heard the shot
i ran down
a deep sob
im sorry can we just back up
you said you heard the shot
s strout did you witness the accident
prosecutor davis jumps up
there are no grounds to in icate this was an accident the judge nods
please strike accident from the record
to marla keyes ms
keyes please rephrase the question
marla keyes hasnt taken her eyes off natalie
they both know whats next
did you actually see the sidearm discharge
davis hands a cup of coffee to matt who sits on a faux leather couch with ruth
to ruth re coffee you sure you dont want
davis takes a seat across from them
you see we cant appeal bail its just not set up that way
ruth y you let that bastard walk out and were supposed to just sit here
dont tell us theres nothing to do about this
its not us s
the states bail code is to ensure future court appearances in this case strouts family was prepared to put up a substantial amount of property as bail that along with
his ties to the community made it hard for us to convince the judge of a serious risk of flight
oh i see
its not just your case
now you can file a civil suit
i recommend it
but not now wait till after the crimminal trial
matt stares at a small cartoonish statue on daviss desk
it is one of those things that were popular in the s
a little man chasing an ambulance
it reads worlds greatest lawyer
and when will that be
next week next month
honestly anywhere between twelve and eighteen months
i thought you said there would be a jury trial sometime in october
if he was incarcerated the udge would move for an october date basically to save the county the cost of housing and feeding him as an inmate but with bail
the court date unfortunately is always later
oh my god oh my god
matt jumps in
but youre confident youll be able to put him away for good then
davis looks uncomfortable with the question
ruth sees this
she gathers herself
the things she said in there
what is the damage
oh jesus christ
the wav this is going thatd be my bet especially since nathan strout brought up that barracuda from boston shes very smart
this was no accident
be killed our son in cold blood
how long would he be sent away for
hard to say really
anywhere between five to fifteen years
we think we have a good shot at the max fifteen
even with good behavior hed do a full ten
are you out of your mind
he killed my son
does anyone know this
matt looks at his shoes as ruth glares down davis
davis sits back a little shook up
im sorry s
unfortunately in situations like this when there is no eye witness there
well theres not a lot we can do
ruth looks out the windshield
both in their own worlds
ruth turns to look out her side window
you took the whole day
a handful of reporters and photographers lingering on the lawn are galvanized by the arrival of the fowlers
ruth is just entering jostled relieved to be home
matts not there
she looks out the front door to surrounded by reporters
fowler how do you feel about richards strouts bail
do you plan to take any further legal action dr
fowler have you had any contact with mr strout
matt stands paralyzed a deer caught in the headlights
matt enters as ruth takes the plates to the sink
she keeps her back to him
he pulls off his coat
can you believe this
i ask those idiots to leave
no one budges
what the hell are we supposed to do bring them sandwiches
her back to h what are you asking or
ruth turns to h if you want them to leave
tell them to leave
ruth is aslee matt stares at the ceiling
he turns to the s clock
it a ter three
he opens a cupboard door and grabs some fig newtons
he stands there eating them the door of the cupboard is long the kind you see in old capes
matt stares at the inside of the door
his finger slides down the length he kneels down
we see what hes looking at
pen and pencil marks straight lines each about two inches apart each with franks name and aqe
matt sits in his chair
the plays muted
he s looks at it but hes not watching
finally he rises clicks the off with the remote and flicks off the light
a small development of modest duplex apartment buildings
the architecture is outdated the landscape unkempt
closer on one corner unit
the lights are off there is no sign of life
a brown suburban sits in the driveway we hear the radio the following is a re broadcast of last nights game the third in a four game series between the
boston red sox and the cleveland indians
this broadcast is the property of major league baseball etc
matt wearing a light coat over his pajamas sits behind the wheel of his car listening to the game
he glances down at a piece of paper with an address
then back out his windshield looking at the corner duplex unit
ruth sits at the table in her bathrobe
the camden herald in one hand
the courier gazette and the working waterfront within easy reach
matt enters fully dressed in jeans and a sweater
he winces at the smoke
you slept late
matt pours himself some coffee
i took one of your pills
you never do that
she turns the page absorbed in an article
shaking her head she slaps the paper down
well there it is in black and white
you should read some of the things he says
matt takes a sip of coffee
he glances down at the paper
he nods without really looking
he checks his watch
i should get going
i wont be gone long
he bends kisses her lightly on the cheek
im meeting willis
ill tell him were coming
she stares at the kitchen doorway long after he exits
finally she pulls the paper back and resumes reading
natalie stands behind the only counter cf a small mom and pop store whose specialty is cold beer wine cigarettes and fish game licenses
she rings up some items for a couple of teenagers
matt enters the place keeping his distance a few feet from the counter
natalie sees him
she pauses as if quickly trying to gather her thoughts the teenagers are waiting for their chang
she counts it back to them and they exit
matt steps forward
elderly woman places a half gallon of milk a dozen eggs i s t er cou nter d a carton of l m cigarettes down or
the reg natalie quickly rings up the items and bags them
can you break a fifty
natalie takes the bill places it in a drawer underneath the register and hands the woman her change with a smile
thank you dear
could i possibly get another bag
natalie quickly double bags the womans groceries
there is a break in the customer flow
natalie steps to the end of the counter
i just wanted to see how youre doing
i tried reaching you
were at my mothers house now
im sorry i wanted to call you
she looks over
a man hovers over some ina
azines near the re inter
i dont even know how to begin
you dont have to
er i didnt lie the first time i didnt its just how it came out
im so sorry
matt nods as if he had assumed as much
is s fowler
does she know youre here
the man places a ack of beer on the counter
natalie looks to matt who shakes his head no
natalie steps back to the register and rings up the beer
her chin quivers
she makes a mistake on the register has to start over
a few more customers gather on line
can i get you anything else
she rings him up
makes change as another customer steps up
matt steps near her trying to maintain privacy
how are the boys
are they okay
natalie choked by emotion cannot respond
near tears she puts her hand up unable to speak
matt reaches out to touch her arm
his gesture is interrupted as she pulls the cigarettes from an overhead rack
the man pays
matt stays a moment longer
theres nothing else to say
she returns to her job
we see ruth from a good distance away watched from afar
she places some potted daisies on a grave
she kneels down
ruth walks through an empty lot and heads for her c she opens the door
hand on her shoulder
she is startled
she turns around
its father oberti
ruth and father oberti sit smoking on a bench
it comes in waves
and then nothing
like a rest in music
no sound but so loud
i dont know what to do
father oberti nods
i feel so ang father oberti looks off in the distance
louise mcvey lost a child a few years back
maybe you remember
mmmm she had four it was the youngest girl wasnt it
she told me about a vision she had when she found out her daughter had died
she saw herself at a great distance from the earth encircling it an endless line as she got closer she saw that it was made up of mothers traveling forward
she fell into line and began walking with them
when they reached a certain point the line divided
she said she knew that all the millions of women on her side were the mothers who had lost children she seemed to find great comfort in that
ruth doesnt react
how did she die
some kind of swimming accident
mower moves across the lawn spitting up a shower of grass
matt pushes the mower
a small bouti e frequented by mature women
blouses with a flair pantsuits an nice dresses han from the racks
the sort of place a woman can still buy a pair joze a white gloves
the front of the store is devoted to footwear
ruth sits while yvonne kneels in front of her holding ruths stockinged foot
she slips on a dress shoe
oh theyre beautiful on you ruth
ruth stands up takes a few steps
she stares at the shoes
they are a rich black
do you have them in brown
i think so let me check
yvonne disappears into the back
ruth walks to the front of the store browsing
she moves to the display window and brings a pair of very young pumps u to her nose and inhales
she smiles and sets the shoes bac on the ledge
something outside catches her attention
the reflection of a couple walking down the sidewalk can be glimpsed in the window their movement washes across ruths a young blond wo holding hands with a dark haired
young he turns to smile at her
we see his face
oblivious to ruths presence
ruth looks disoriented
im sorry ruth theres only the black
she turns from the window
yvonne stands next to her an open shoe box in her hands
two hefty bags are dragged along the walk
matt tosses one next to a garbage that sits just inside the garage
he picks up the other bag tossing it inside
the bottom splits and grass spills out onto the drive way
he goes inside and returns with a broom
he sweeps the rass into a pile
picking up handfuls and refilling the gay
he takes the broom and sweeps whats left back toward the la
he stops stares down at his feet
in the cement a childs handprintsand writing frank ruths car pulls into the driveway
she gets out almost slamming the car door
without a word she moves past matt and into the house
matt continues sweeping
ruth wakes to the sound of metal on metal
she looks over to matt hes not there
she steps to the window pulls back the shears and looks out
through the window in the dark alone flashlight in hand
matt is dismantling the swin set
a four room dwelling surrounded by a wrap around porch that looks out over a canopy of forest below
the place was built before insulation was practical
planks beams and studs are exposed
there is a bathroom two bedrooms and a common room consisting of a kitchen dining area and living room with a ge river stone fireplace
there are two oil burning ps hanging from cross beams at each end of the room
ruth sits next to katie at a table in the middle of the room
katie is ouring over a stack of snapshot books descibin her chid h and r dchildren in eac pose
the photos w ile many are all from a single trip that the family made to florida
there is a clear dif erence in vernacular between the two women katie also has a voice that has been trained to reach anyone who might be in the f
corners of her house
s lil charles down at the oh and here pool he figured out how to get down to the pool on the elevator all by himself
he must of been very proud
oh heres shannon waitin in for that rollercoaster you know the one
ruth has no idea

well some of em
yeah sixty minutes and upward unless of coarse ya got the fast pass
whats the fast pass
well ya got all the different kingdo there and so you take the fast pass its a kind of a laminated card and you put it intah a machine and
it tells you what time to come back so you can go right in without waitin in lane

ruth smiles at the thought and shakes her head
no how many grandchildren do yo u have now
katie turns from the snapshots and takes a breath while holding up her fingers to count she is genuinely unsure
under her breath well theres lil charles shannon the three older ones and the babies
that must wonderful
katie smiles and nods it is a by rote i well
willis always says guess theres no danger of us dying off she catches herself
she looks at ruth

when i was little my big sister could get me to do anything
more than once she got me to throw m self down the stairs by telling inc the blanket she wrapped me in was a magic car et naturally not being
that swift i believed her

a rollercoaster alright that one there
she points to the pictures
a ride in the dark no less
a great endless expanse of fir trees
we are f up looking out at this timbered landscape that seems to stretch forever
matt stands before the edge of a cliff d
ressr a short sleeved shirt
he takes a deep breath of the ri
ountain a steady chopping rhythm is heard in the background
willis is chopping the last of some firewood
how much of this is yours
willis plants his in the stump

matt continues surveying awed
willis turns starts walking back to his chore

matt and willis load the wood into a small trailer attached a green polaris magnum atv

matt sits behind willis on the atv as they pull the wood up road
the trees clear and we see the cabin
a green subaru forester is parked in front
willis katie matt and ruth sit around a copious holiday spread well into their meal
its a wonderful product and the treat you pretty good
it was on account oz selling mary kay that we got the new subaru
the ride up was very comfortable

she walks over to the window and fingers the fabric
theyre pillowcases from our first house
ruth smiles at the memory
katie sits back down at the table
oh ive saved every knick knack whim wham we ever had
a post stands proudly at the end of a dirt and gravel road
attached to it are two signs
one reads private road
the other no hunting
it butts up against two lanes of blacktop a small logging road
headlights cut through the early evening
williss idea of a s a green subaru forester kicks up some rocks
it pauses briefly before taking a right onto the pavement
the car is stopped behind a wooden guard arm
a swing bridge opens for a large fishing boat
the bridge is operated by one man
be uses a long metal tool that he loops into a pulley system which lies beneath a grid in the center of the bridge
ruth asleep in the back seat it s been a long weekend

she finishes her breakfast as she pours through the weekends mail
matt in a suit steps in to say goodbye

who looks to ruth for some kind of reaction
matt heads out the door
ruth continues sorting the mail
she stops on one piece
seems stunned repeatedly reading it
its from publishers clearinghouse
in oversized block letters it reads she stares at the piece for a long time
and starts giggling
she cant stop
the giggles quickly flow into a deep laughing fit harder and harder as the tears rain down
matt is in his office on the phone
well thats totall unacceptable isnt it

she senses something in his tone
hes across the street
kuurret on main restaurant day a bustling dining room packed with businessmen
the nice place in town its lunch hour
the doors open
he scans the room
his eyes set on sitting at a table with colleagues sharing a laugh
matt makes his way over to the table
davis sees h hey matt
matt stands awkwardly as davis companions look on
have a seat
matt hesitates takes a seat next to davis
manages an obligatory smile to the others
the conversation resumes
on the street outside the restaurant walking
were doing all we can matto i promise you that
what can i do bill
matt takes davis arm
it cant be manslaughter
theres got to be something isnt there something you can find
a piece of evidence
that happens doesnt that happen
he realizes hes holding davis arm
he lets goo davis looks at matt sympathetically
we really are doing everything we can matt but im not going to lie to you weve got no witnesses only strout who claims there was a struggle and forensic
cant determine if there was a struggle
because of the condition the house was in when frank got there
matt says nothing
they come to the corner
matt steps under an awning and into the shade
he shifts feet a couple of tes
pla ing with the change in his pocket the way people do when theyre uncomfortable
im sorry att
if it helps we all want this guy put away
we have kids too
matt nods without looking at him
matt looks at daviss hand moving the change
he becomes hypnotized by the sound
davis continues talking
matt cant hear a word of it though
all he hears is the clinking of the coins in the pocket
matt stands in the wheelhouse he brings the helm about
cuts back on the throttle and heads for the winch the stern is stacked with four high rows of franks empty traps
matt pulls up a string of pots
opens the door and pulls out a young male
he flinches and drops it
his finger goes to his mouth
loaded up to the gills with pots
she turns toward harbor
matt at the wheelhouse heading in
his hand on the wheel blood trickles from his finger
he sucks on it again reaches down underneath his feet and pulls a band aid from a box and applies it to the finger
matt unloads franks traps onto the landing
seems to sense something
he looks back up the gangway
jason sits on his bicycle watching
the two regard each other for a moment
then without a word jason rides off
willis dries a glass
he keeps an eye on matt sitting at a booth in the front
f the diner silhouetted by a window
he pushes a half eaten burger away drains a bottle of beer
its not the first
willis sets down a cup of coffee for himself
takes a seat across from h they both gaze absently out the window
ruth is alone at her desk she wears headphones and is busy making notations on a sheet of manuscript paper
theres a knock on her door
she doesnt look up
taking off the phones yes
theres a pause then the door slowly opens
natalie takes a step in
ruth looks up
if shes surprised she doesnt show it i a i hope this is okay
ruth says nothing
natalie moves closer
ive been hoping we might be able to get together to talk
ruth watches her as she approaches the desk
natalie bends and cautiously extends her hand for ruth to hold
i just want to tell you how e and in a flash ruth slaps natalie across the face with her open hand
natalie springs back paralyzed with shock
she tries to catch her breath staring directly at ruth
eyes ablaze ruth says nothing
the two women look at each other for a very long time and final as if she finally somehow got the resolution she came for lead held high natalie turns
and walks out
cyclone fence surrounds the lace
sign reads strout it is the end of the day
a grow of workers file out gabbing starting to strip the eves of their smocks and hair nets
tim franks friend exits with his co workers
he climbs into his mini pick up and pulls out of the lot
a few seconds later from outside the lot matts car pulls a crowded working class tavern
video oker machines beef jerky at the bar schaeffers on tap
were in fuck
its happy hour
tim sits around a table with a couple of buddies laughing
we lost a few strings and we had a fair idea it was him who was doing it sos i just flat out asked him no wasnt me

the door to the bar opens

tim and the others crack up

stops mid sentence
matt is passing by his table
matt flinches surprised to see tim
matt and tim have moved to another booth
matt leans heavily on his elbows listening to tim
no no i dont even see richard anymore
and hed never tell me anything believe me
matt takes a pull of beer
sure of course
i was just wondering you know maybe there was something you heard through the grapevine maybe one of his buddies said something no a i was thinking richards brothers theyre
still working with you right
they must talk
tim throws a nervous look over to the table where his friends ea theyre oblivious to the conversation
he looks back to matt shifting in his seat
matt leans forward
he speaks in an intense whisper
im just saying tim if we could find something something concrete
if you could just
it could be just a slip of the tongue tim looks into matts eyes feeling the torment
ill keep my ears open
matt looks at him dissatisfied
its funny running into you here dr
matt looks at tim blankly then finishes his beer
matt drives end of highway
matt pulls into the left hand turn lane and signals
there is a car in front of h above the licence plate is a yellow sticker which reads student driver the plate itself is a vanity plate it says p
y us a blue pick truck eases to a stop in the right lane next to matts car
matt glances over for a moment he half expects to see frank
he cracks the passenger side window for a better look
he stares at the drivers window
their window rolls down
attractive girl with short brunette hair stares back at matt
lost in the absurdity he doesnt look away
the light changes
the girl smiles sweetly and blows him a kiss before continuing through the light
matt watches her go he smiles as if somehow relieved
the car behind him gives a polite toot matt makes the left
ruth enters passing the empty front register
she strolls down an aisle pulling some items from the shelves
two n chat from the next aisle
yeah man i d better get back to the grind alright pal just dont ste al anything
nic s wearing a clerk s apron price gun and plastic tag tha says ic rounds the end of the aisle
as he does he spots ruth moving down the aisle toward him
he freezes a nervous smile he throws a quick look to the other aisle
a little too loudly good evening s fowler
ruth pulls out her purse as nick rings her up
oh and a pack of marlboro lights sure as nick reaches up to the overhead cigarette area he cant help but glance past ruth
ruth catches this she turns and sees appear from a far aisle he makes a beeline for the door he leaves looks back its a long time before ruth moves
finally she turns back to nick
he looks at her embarrassed awaiting her reaction
she just stares at h hatt sits comfortably feet up beer in hand deep into the book orte diurban by j f rowers he emars the front door s he
most immediately he hears the banging of cupboards opening d closing
ruth is putting groceries away ignoring or trying to matt who has appeared in the doorway
she puts milk in the refrigerator and stares into it for a long time trying to decide what to do
he can feel her judging finall
having resolved something in her mind she closes the refrigerator door revealing taped to it several newspaper articles on the case gathered by her no doubt including one with a
picture of frank
how did it go today
she doesnt answer
she doesnt turn around
like what matt
what could be wrong
she continues straightening up starts recklessly washing dishes
matt doesnt leave
a plate shatters in the sink
this stops her
she stares at it then feels his presence
she turns around
what do you want
he looks unsure of himself
i want to know whats going on
youre obviously upset
if theres something you want to talk about
oh you mean to each other
what if somebod waked in
they wouldnt recognize us
theyd think they had the wrong house
matt takes this in
he breathes deeply
do you want to talk or not
oh you must mean about our dead son
no we havent before why should we bother now
they stare at each other across the kitchen
what can i do ruth
ruth looks at him for a long time
forget it matt
why dont you just go
what do you want from me
i want you to stop acting like nothings happened
thats what i want
because im not bouncing off the walls
no matt that would require feelings
we dont want you to hurt yourself
do me a favor ruth
you want to have a grieving contest go find someone else
he starts to turn
yeah i know how you grieve
have another beer
he spins back
what do you ow
you know nothing
you know nothing about me
what i go through every day ever lousy stinking day
no i dont know matt
i dont know what you go through or if you go through ything
but thats your choice dear not mine
youre goddamn right it is
my choice is to not scream at the world
maybe one of us has to be reasonable here did you ever think of that
e matt i don t know about you but i ss my son
im glad you have time for reason
thats what you imparted to frank that sense of reason oh he thought you were very reasonable
what the hell is that supposed to mean
she is about to say something but stops short
she turns back to the dishes
he moves in on her seething
what are you really trying to say anyway
she says nothing picking up the broken plates
that im the one responsible
she drops the pieces back in the sink and exits
hes fast on her heels
she heads for the bedroom
let me tell you something
let me tell you something
she throws the door closed behind her but he bangs it open with his palm
you of it backwards
i know what you think
that i was too lenient that i let him get away with
she exits into hes right behind her
why do you think he never came to you
he wouldnt talk to me matt
he didnt trust me
you made sure of that
why would he talk to you ruth
you never listened
but you did
you were winking at him the whole time
you encouraged him
you wanted what he had
youve got to be kidding
you know it
you wanted it and you couldnt get it thats why you didnt stop him so you could get your kicks through your son
you know thats what happened
and now you cant cope with it
you cant admit the truth to me or to yourself you cant admit that he died for ygur fantasy piece of ass
matt stunned reels for a second and then finally explodes
you want to know why our son is dead ruth
he wasnt with her because of me he went there because of you
because you were so controllins so overbearing so angry that he was it that he was our only one
that is not true
from the time he was little you were telling him why he was wrong
everything he did was wrong
what was wrong with him ruth
she stares at him dumbfounded
you are so unfor ivinge you are
thats what he said
ana youre playing the same shit out with me thats a horrible way to be
youre bitter ruth
you can point your finger at me all you want but you better take a good look at yourself first
she already has of course
i just wanted to talk about what happened matt
you expect me just to open up to you
you scare me
how can i talk to you
i cant even look at you
they suddenly become aware of the doorbell ringing over and over
they watch each other both reeling both out of breath
the doorbell continues
matt opens it
there is no cop just kristen gellar a young gymnast whod like to compete in hawaii
im kristen gellar from the rockland gymnastics association today were selling brand name candy
each purchase is matched by the tandy corporation to help us meet our goal of travelling to oahu to compete in the east west conference
matts in another world
he stares at her
ill take some
terrific how many

if by rote matt pulls out his wallet and hands her a ten
particular brands you like
we have goobers hersheys anything
anything is fine
she finally hands him an assortment
okay hes about to close the door
if you could just sign this
i have to give you a receipt
this pen matt hands her one from his pocket
matt waits as the girl fills out and hands him the receipt
he closes the door before she can thank h ruth is curled up on the couch
matt stands over her unsure of which way to go
he stares absently into the small mountain of candy in his hands sets it on the coffee table he takes a seat at the other end of the couch
had no right
what i said
no one no one should ever have to hear that
im so sorry
he looks at her as she starts to cry
he moves closer to her
no youre right matt you are am
i dont blame you matt
that girl came by
she came by the school and i couldnt forgive her
i was so
she lets go crying hard
he lifts her head onto his lap
he reaches out stroking her head pulling her matted hair from her forehead as she sobs into his lap
i have been so an i keep seeing him matt
ive seen him
matt nods but hes not really clear
oh i know up in his room sometimes i swear franks in there on the way home just now at a stop light for a second not frank
she breaks into sobs
and i dont know what to do
where did you see him
eve here downtown and the market
i saw at south end
he smiled at me matt i keep running into him
he s led
matt still strokes her hair
but hes in another world
the game has just started
henry carl willis pick up the old banter as if matt had onl been away on vacation but he can see the affection an courtesy
in their eyes
the ne of the game is texas chase he groans
is there a problem
why do you delude yourself with that crap
what are you talking about
look were not in vegas
its five card draw or seven card stud
thats what i said five card draw jacks to open carl
asshole matt smiles
hes missed these guys
ill open with a dollar
raise a buck
the bets to matt
he stares at his cards for a very long time
willis looks to say something when henry hits his arm
this stops him
matt looks up
he sees the patience they are all exercising for his typical indecisiveness
this bothers him
he stares back down at his cards
stalling waiting for someone to bust him
he looks u at willis henry carl
they all sort of smile uncomfortably
he cant take it
oh for christ sake say something
this wakes them up
quit pussy footing around me d t
you just gonna let me stare at these cards all night
no one wants to make the first move
this upsets matt even more
he stares back down at his cards
finally it is carl who speaks
there are things of which i may not speak there are dreams that cannot die there are thoughts that make the strong heart weak and bring a pallor into the
cheek and a mist before the eye
and the words of that fatal song come over me like a chill a boys will is the winds will and the thoughts of youth are long long thoughts
matt looks up from his cards into carls eyes
the two men regard each other
the game has ended
matt says goodnight to henry and carl as the two of them pull out of willis is driveway
matt is about to leave
just climbing in the front seat
when willis puts a hand on his shoulder
come back in for a drink
willis and matt step back in closing the door behind them
honey are you coming to bed now
willis moves to the steps leading upstairs
soon baby matts still here
oh f hi matt hone would you mind bringing me my pit s
theyre downstairs from when the kids were here
ill be right there
a few minutes later
matt sits alone in the room
be gets up to examine a picture hanging on the opposite wall
hes not particularly interested hes seen it a million times hes just killing time
a corner of the room devoted to naval memories
a pristine version of matts u
constellation cap serves as the center piece
willis comes down from upstairs
shes all set now what can i get you
im fine thanks
willis nods and takes a seat
you back on the wagon
sit down matt youre making me nervous
matt takes a seat
im glad you came tonight
boy carl really laid on the verse huh
ye he did
got me thinking e stops himself
i dont know sort of silly really
cmon what is it
this thing with with frank when he was about three i guess
we were over at my folkls house
mom always liked little dogs this one was a pekingese i think
i remember hearing this yelp and then a scream
frank ran out pointing to his finger
i looked at it couldnt see an thino
mom said frank must have cornered the dog and i knew she was probably right
we were driving home and ruth noticed frank itching his a
she pulled back his sleeve and there were these two deep bloody puncture marks
why do you think he pointed to his finger
matt shakes his head
i cruess he didnt want us to ow
he stares into his hands as the memory crystallizes
willis looks confused and somewhat uncomfortable
he gets up and heads to the bar
had to put that dog down
willis throws some ice in a tumbler
i was thinking just the other day about the last time frankie was matt cuts him off
his name was ar k
willis looks stunned
im sorry matt
i dont care
he just never liked being called that
he looks away
she didnt tell me willis
she never said a word she saw him at south end
shes seen him before
its killing her i didnt think about bail
i thought i wouldnt have to worry about him for you know what i heard
hes tending bar up to old orchard beach
matt looks up
for a friend
ever notice even the worst bastards have friends
nobody knows him over there
if theydo they dont care
they drink what he mixes willis sets a can of moxie down in front of matt
referring to the can i dont know how you drink this stuff its what drove me to beer as a child
he sits down with his own drink
i hate him matt
my boys went to school with h he was the same thei
know what he do
five at the most and then you e bumping into h all over i ow
remember that woman about seven years a o
shot her husband sopped him of f t e bridge in the st gac with a hundred pound sack of cement and said the whole way through it nobody helped
know where she is now
shes in sears ort now a secretary
and whoever helped her where the hell is he
itd break my heart matt it would but you ever think about just moving away
stares into his hands for a long time
yeah we have
finally he looks up his eyes meeting willis i s
it wouldnt matter
the voice is joined by another and becomes a duet
we turn to find the voices and see we are at the foot of a small knoll
a steeple in the distance pokes thorough the last blue husk as the sun dies
looking around we see an ancient gazebo then stairs leading up to a stone library a boulder at the foot of another knoll above descending toward us the girls each
holding a single candle dressed in brightly embroidered smocks enter in procession singing jennie mae mama
the effect is beautiful and feels like a sort of quickening
the group proceeds down the hill and blossoms into an amphitheater which faces the harbor
ruth stands at the bottom of the proscenium her arms up directing the choir
the place is filled with half the town
trying to take it all in
but not really present
suddenly he turns and leaves
the town goes to sleep for the night
the signs businesses power down
the establishments various beer signs interior lights turn off
a large chain of keys turns the tumbler of a deadbolt lock
two cars are all thats left
a waitress emerges from the bar
richard is fast on her heels
he exits making conversation as he quickly locks the doors
hey o wait up
good night richard
see ya tomorrows she starts to walk to her car he catches up to her accompanying her to her car
you want to come over for a drink
just a drink
she stops in front of her car
maybe some other night
he stands in front of his brown suburban watching as the waitress gets in her car pulls away and leaves
he turns and freezes
matt fowler stands a few feet away an ortaies calibre
automatic directly at richards face
his gloved hand poin grips the gun tightly
unlock it and get in
wait a minute
lets lets just calm down
matt cocks the gun
he unlocks both doors
matt opens the back door but stays planted the gun trained on richard
richard gets in the drivers seat
matt climbs in the back
he presses the guns muzzle against the back of richards head
is there any one at your place
richard looks over his shoulder to back the car up
matt aims at his temple but does not look at his eyes
richard finishes backing up and puts it into drive
drive slowly dont try to get stopped
matt can see the ocean
he uncocks the revolver
matt cracks the window
matt leans down in his seat
he transfers the gun into his left hand removes the glove from his right and wipes the sweat from his bare palm onto his pantleg
he puts the glove back on gripping the gun
richards brown suburban drives down an alley adjacent to fun park and turns onto a deserted main street
they drive back through town the sea wall on their left hiding the beach
on the right are the places most with their neon signs off that do so much business in s er the lounges and cafes and pizza houses
the street itself empty of traffic
he was making it with my wife
his voice is careful not pleading
matt presses hard with the muzzle against richards head
richard flinches and moves his head forward
matt lowers the gun to his lap
don t talk
the brown suburban slowly pulls up to the front
matt leans forward
muzzle grazing richards head
drive it to the back
you wouldnt have it cocked would you
for when i put on the brakes
matt cocks it
it is now
he drives around the side of the building
the brown suburban inches forward toward the garage and brakes
the engine shuts off
matt keeps the cocked gun firmly trained on richard
he gets out and shuts the door with his hip
richard looks at the gun then gets out
he moves across the grass
matt closely behind looking at the row of small backyards on either side of them and scattered tall trees
he glances from house to house
looking for signs of one insomniac neighbor some man or woman sitting alone watching the all night channel from boston
all is quiet
they move up the back walk and to the side kitchen door
matt stands directly behind richard as he opens the door
it s pitch black inside the duplex
turn on the light
richard flips the wall switch
in the light
matt stares at his wide back and long reach
richard stops just inside the kitchen
matt closes the door softly behind gim
where s you r suitcase
richard almost turns around
matt grips the gun tighter straining to keep it from ling
where is it
in the bedroom closet
thats where were going then
when we get to a door you stop and turn on the light
they cross the kitchen
matt cant help but glance at the sink and stove and refrigerator no dishes in the sink or even the dish rack beside it no grease splashings on the stove
the refrigerator clean and white
matt becomes momentarily reoccupied with one of duncans drawings taped to its door
matt looks conflicted
doubt has crept into his face for a moment he seems to have lost his resolve
matt looks to richard with a renewed sense of purpose
a light flicks on
they take the hall past the living room
matt doesnt want to see anymore of richards life
but he cant help h elf
he takes it all in magazines and newspapers in a wicker basket clean ashtrays a stereo cds neatly shelved next to it
they continue down a hallway
richard stops outside a door
theres no wall switch
wheres the light
richard steps into the darkness
matt is careful to stay a pace behind
richard leans over by the bed
a small bedside lamp turns on
the bed a double one is neatly made the ashtray on the bedside table clean the bureau top dustless and no photographs prob ly so the girl who is scae
wont have to see natalie in the bedroom she believes is theirs
but because matt is a father and a husband thou h never ex husband he knows and does not want to ow that this bedroom has never been theirs alone
richard turns around matt looks at his lips his wide jaw
i wanted to work things out with her
try to get together with her again
but i couldnt even talk to her
he was always with her
fowler im going to jail for it
i am going to jail
if i ever get out ill be an old man
isnt that enough
youre not going to jail
pack clothes for warm weather
whats going on
youre not gonna let me go
matt looks away
he doesnt answer
youre jumping bail
matt points the pistol at richards face
the barrel trembles a little
richard reaches up into his closet and pulls out two large canvas bags
he places them on the he pulls a third bag a small red womans suitcase natalies no doubt next to the others
he moves to the bureau
its the trial
we cant go through that my wife and me
so youre leaving
ive got you a ticket
my wife keeps seeing you
i cant have that anymore
he was making it with my wife
id go pick up my kids and hed be there
sometimes he spent the night
duncan told me
he doesnt look at matt as he speaks
he opens the to ewer
matt steps closer so he can see richards hangs
underwear and the socks rolled the underwear folded and stacked
richard arranges them neatly in the suitcase
the kitchen the livin room the clothes
matt is struck b this mans sense of order o iscio ine
matt watches the absurdity of richard sorting clothes by season
he even packs a small instamatic camera
he packs the things a man accumulates and become part of him
re the suitcases okay thats enough
i need some things from the bathroom
richard steps just inside the bathroom door and stops
matt realizes richard means to have privacy
he pushes him into the room
takes a step back and pulls the door so it is only slightly ajar
he keeps his foot between the jam and the door
he eyes richards back reflected in the mirror
he can hear him make water
he looks like he wonders about allowing this courtesy
mattes glances at a picture on the wall outside of the bathroom natalie richard and their two boys in front of someones house
she looks happy
looks around the room frantically his eyes find nothing that will help his situation he flushes the toilet matt swings the door fully open richard fills a travel kit with
richard tucks the travel kit into a bag
matt keeps the gun on him
richard closes the suitcase and faces matt
he looks at the matt moves around behind him
now richard is between matt and the lighted hall
richard carries a canvas bag in each hand
matt pulls another glove from his pocket
he uses it to turn off the bedside lamp
richard now d lhouetted in the doorway
richard steps into the hall
matt follows carrying the small suitcase in one hand the gun in the other
they start down the hallway
matt turns off lights with his elbow as they go
past the living room into the kitchen
richard tenses he stops at the kitchen door
matt sets the suitcase down
he uses that hand to reach into his jacket
he pulls out a red white and blue piece of paper
he drops it on the counter top
words on the paper read amt rack
matt picks up the suitcase again
he steps closer to him
presses the gun into richards back
open the door
richards reaches down and carefully turns the knob
he slowly pulls the door open
matt takes a step back
get the light
richard reaches down and hits the switch
the two men now in silhouette
richard exits first
matt close behind
matt sets the case down reaches bacjcan gently closes the door
they walk down the two brick steps to the lawn
s the cross the lawn
matts eves and ears once a ain alert for any sign of life
they reac the garage walk to the back of the brown suburban
richard drops the two bags near the rear bumper
matt keeps the gun steady as richard pops open the hatch and loads the bags
matt sets the small suitcase at richards feet
he reaches down and loads it last
richard gets into the drivers seat
matt in the back
richard looks up in the rear view
for a moment matt connects with the desperate eyes
theyll catch me
theyll check passenger lists
i didnt use your name
theyll figure that out too
you think i wouldnt have done it myself if it was that easy
he starts it up slides into reverse
he looks back over his shoulder as they back down the driveway
matt averts his stare
looking down at the gun barrel but not at the profiled face beyond it
you were alone
weve got it worked out
matt doesnt answer though
richard shifts into drive
the brown suburban pulls out of the lot and onto the street
theres no planes this time of night dr
back through town
then north on
the airports south
somebodys going to keep you for a while
theyll take you to the airport turn on the radio
find the game
its after three they run it again
matt leans back quietly uncorking the hammer
no more talking
richard tries to read matt s face in the mirror but it s now in shadows
richard fumbles with the radio surfing the stations
matt is right
the game is on
nomar garcia arra hits a long drive to left with runners in scoring position a cinch to collect hits this season
richard sets his eyes on the road
the brown suburban heads away from old orchard onto a small two lane rural hi hwayy
the road is flanked on both sides by open fields and lonely capes
few cars on the road
they come up over the high bride over the channel to the left the smacking curling white at the breakwater and beyond that the dark sea and a full moon
and down to the right the small fishing boats bobbing at anchor in the cove
swirling colors from behind catch their attention
richard and matt both look in the rear view
a state troopers car with its gumballs flashing races up in the distance behind them
matt jams the gun into richards ribs and slouches down
trying to stay ca ri ht take it easy pull over to the shoo der
matt richard sit tight waiting for the inevitable
the light gains in intensity as the cab fills with crimson
the cruiser tears right past them
quickly fading into the distance
e matt leans back he looks shaken
richard watches his chance the vague outline of mountains it is almost pitch black
onl hi d the moon
then from far off a pair of headlights move tow us fighting through the thick night richard sees the sign for the north
he glances back at matt in the rearview mirror
he makes the turn
the brown suburban makes the turn
matt richard check out their surroundings
the brown suburban drives across a small steel bridge that covers a salt river
the tires make a low thumping sound on the grid
they have left the and are driving on a small rural route
matt leans forward the gun rests against the top of richards seat
he looks around trying to get a bearing
we missed it
back and turn in at the last road
richard slows and makes a u turn
his lights illuminate private road and no hunting signs
he takes a right onto a dirt road flanked on both sides by fir trees
we track with the brown suburban as fir trees strobe in the foreground
theres nothing back here dr
i donut understand why you don t just its for youre car
you dont think wed leave it at the airport do you
they crawl up the trail the wheels crunching the gravel the headlights shining into the dense woods
the road seems endless
richard cringes as they bounce over a bump
both of them eagerly peer beyond the windshield
finally at a great distance the tiny lit windows of a cabin come into view
a blue chevy pickup is parked in front of the place
the brown suburban crawls to a stop
richard keeps the engine running
matt presses the gun hard against his neck
he straightens in his seat and looks in the rearview mirror
matts eyes meet his in the glass for an instant before focusing on the hair at the end of the gun barrel
turn it off
the ball game disappears and the silence is strangely a anent
he continues to hold the w eel with both hands
he ooks in the mirror
ill do twenty years dr
fowler ill be fifty four years old
thats two years younger than i matt gets out and kcks the door shut
richard opens his door
he doesnt move
just sits in the interior light
his face now pleading
matt can see it in his lips
get the bags
where are we dr
richard carefully gets out
instinctively he raises his hands about shoulder level
they move to the back of the brown suburban
richard pops the hatch
he pulls out the two canvas bags
he sets them on the ground
he reaches in and pulls out the small suitcase
we hear a screen door slam shut
richard looks surprised
he turns back to matt
richard reaches down and picks up the bags
he struggles to carry all three
matt grabs the small suitcase from him
richard lugs the bags toward the cabin
we hear heavy crunching footsteps of someone approaching
he nods to matt
ill get them son
willis takes the bags from richard turns and carries them up the long path back to the cabin
richard looks s r e relieved
he waits a moment u sure of what to do
finally he starts wal
ing up the path after willis
richard stops d step
he tenses waiting
you can carry this one
he reaches out to take the bag from matt
matt keeps it at his side and takes a step back his gun trained on richard
matt stands there motionless
we hear footsteps
willis runs up to matt
the two men look into each others eyes
matt seems to be somewhe re else he looks back down at the body
this isnt what we talked out he tried to run
willis looks at the gun still in matts hand the little suitcase in the other
we were going to wait and take him out in the woods
matt raises his head
he looks at willis flatly
i coul t wait
a d in a blue tarp is suddenly dragged away by the atv
it es quite a racket
we follow it as it scrapes along the road back into the woods they have roved the body from the atv and are now draggin it deep into the wood
the only sound is the breaking of brans es and their continual grunting
the stopat the top of a small knoll panting and sweating
wil is quietly removes a small mass of branches revealing a o t large well dug hole
together they drag the body t he edge of the hole
move behind it
lift the legs and push it in
willis and matt come up from the woods
they carry richards lug age
willis drops the canvas bags into the hole
matt loo s at the suitcase and then drops it in
willis takes a couple of steps away and grabs two shovels leaning against a small birch
he hands one to matt
together they begin filling in the hole
matt holds the flashlight as willis sprinkles leaves and branches over the hole
willis freezes as if he has heard something
matt cuts the light
they hear some footsteps approaching closer then they see it not yards distant watchin them a buck with a splendid rack a deep chestsnowy white a l of him in
his prime his flag up d twitching
his eyes u quin then he bounds off and is gone
the walk through the woods
the light on the ground
they bot look up through the trees where they end at the lake
neither of them speak only the sounds of their hea breathing and clumsy strides through the low brush and over fa len branches
wide and dark lap ing softly at the bank a small island near its middle with black tall evergreens
matt gun in hand takes two steps back he strides with the throw and goes to one knee as he follows through
the dark shapeless object arcing downward splashing
matt in the brown suburban is stopped behind the wooden and arm willis in his own car behind
the swing bridge is open for the a
the operator uses his long metal tool the bridge swings back around
the arm rises
seems somewhere else
cmon g m tt
matt drives the brown suburban over the bridge
the operator gives him a friendly nod
waves to willis in the ford
williss truck richards s travel towards us away from wiscasset
on their way to cheesy town island
willis watches out his windshield as the brown suburban parks in the stations lot
matt gets out of the brown suburban and locks the drivers door
be walks the ford and gets in the passenger side
they drive off
williss car moves slowly over the channel bridge back to wiscasset
matt rolls down his window
be tosses richards keys over the side of the brad e
the trim shapes of lobster boats and smal craft anchored in t he hexbor below loo like old toys in a bathtub he rolls up the window as the car
both men silent lost in thought staring out the windshield at the road ahead
what time is it
matt checks his watch
ten to six
we lost an hour
williss jaw tightens
almost losing his temper yep
cant stop people from fishin matt uckin brides matt looks over at willis
im sor willis
willis looks at matt
eyes back to the road
stopped in to his little shed there once place reeked
the guys spilled more whiskey than weve ever drunk
just pray hes already three sheets to the wind
matt doesnt reply
katies pill will be wearing off soon
they drive down the empty streets of a sleeping rockland
something catches matts attention in the store front
the anne ins in the window they seem to be staring at h the ford pulls up to the curb
matt gets out
willis drives away
matt starts walking
the street lights suddenly turn off
the world is waking up now
in the distance matt can see his house
the birds all seem to wake at once
matt gazes up into the trees overhead the first light just kissing their branches the sky now a husky blue
the surrounding houses with the windows still dark asleep
he picks up his pace
he roves his tennis shoes his pants he starts unbuttoning his shirt
now in his t shirt and boxers he examines his clothes and shoes carefully before putting them into the washer he pours detergent inside and starts the cycle
he steps to a little sink and washes up
the light has been left on he kills it and heads upstairs
matt slowly walks down the hall to and stands in the doorway
he pauses seeing only the orange ember of ruths cigarette in the dark
did you do it
he doesn t answer
he walks in and comes to bed climbing in as ruth moves over
are you all right
he lies down
faces the window away from her
she is on her side she props herself up on her elbow watching him
he waits a longtime before speaking there was a picture with natalie and the boys hanging on his wall ruth looks at him strangely
what is it matt
the way she was smiling
i dont know ruth looks at the back of matts head
he doesnt move
he says nothing else
she continues to stare at him
uncertainty beginning to form on her face
she looks lost
if only things cou d be as t ey were
at i thinking you must be hungry
she waits for a response but gets e
she gets out of bed leaves the room and heads down stairs
we eear ruth downstairs in the kitchen
matt just lies there in another world
matt dear do you want coffee
be doesnt respond
instead he looks at his finger
the bandage wet from washing up
he slides it off easily like oversized ring
the skin has healed
sun light creeps in through the curtains onto matts face
ruth lies sleeping on his chest
a breakfast tray at his bedside which he hasnt touched matt is cede awake
he stares at the ceiling reliving it his eyes full of an unspeakable sadness
the lids heavy
if only he could sleep
but he wont
there is a small crack in the ceiling
hell have to fix that
