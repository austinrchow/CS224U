written by mario puzo francis ford coppola the screen is black
first we hear the sound of a single trumpet playing slowly and sadly the notes faintly resonant as if echoing through the narrow streets of some old hill village in
now confusingly we see a slant of light move past us and another and as our surroundings become more visible we discover that we are moving through a pine forest
lit by shafts of morning sunlight
suddenly we come out of the trees and find ourselves on the nevada shore of lake tahoe
it is a clear cold morning in september of nineteen fifty nine
we now see the corleone compound at lakeside half hidden by pines and firs
we move toward it past the gates and guard houses past the guest houses past the kennels for the guard dogs and finally to the front driveway of the main
house where a conservative sedan is being loaded by a chauffeur and a pair
of large dark headed men named al neri and rocco lampone
rocco limps slightly
as suitcases are being placed in the trunk of the car the front door to the main house opens and tom hagen a trim serious balding man in a business
suit appears he crosses to the corner of the house and looks off
standing by the shore of the lake is a little boy
tony adams corleone aged about ten
the boy dressed for travel is looking off at the lake his back to ward us
as he looks out at the lake we might sense that he is troubled and puzzled although he is managing to keep his expression stoic
hagen can be seen in the background by the house after a moment
time to go
there is a beat and tony composes himself turns and moves up toward the house and tom hagen
the heavy black sedan is loaded
connie corleane and a housekeeper in uniform are bringing mary about five out to the car
she too is dressed for travelling
as they put her into the car in you get will
daddy be at the airport
as tom and tony come up
ere wanted me to tell you both how sorry he was
connie would apparently prefer to avoid answering any questions
e sure and give my love to your mother
it isnt like you wont be back from time to time
i bet we all
be together for christmas
wait and see
tony gems into the car
he locks out the window to ward the house
we begin xxi n ti
tzs c s
hagen is the last one into the car
as it starts down the driveway on its way to the airport in reno connie lampone neri and the housekeeper all wave
the auto matic gate at the foot of the driveway opens
the guard at the gate flicks a half salute as the limousine passes through
tee group r n font of eoqse as the group breaks connie and the housekeeper going back inside neri and lampone drifting off we pan up ward to a window
in the second story and zoom in
michael corleone has moved the curtain aside with one hand and is looking after the disappearing limousine his expression unreadable but somehow sad
we are close on tony looking out the window of the airliner his own expression matching that of his father
national ai ort stoce day as an airliner of the period comes in for a landing
a limousine is moving northbound up interstate
maples on either side of the road are turning red and yellow
we pan the limousine past and continue to pan to a sign marking the stateline between massachusetts and new hampshire
l mc sinne day it is almost night
tony is looking out the window as the limousine enters the little town of hanover moves down past the da

clapboard house with giant elms and maples in the front yard
the limousine stops outside the house
under its fanlight the front door swings open and ray adams comes out
as her children run to her she kneels and gathers them into her arms
we move in close on tony and as we hold the
nn titles a
nd credits are over and we begin to hear our nation is and has been histor ically the symbol of freedom of justice and opportunity and its pecui
iar strength is that no matter what our individual background we are close on a young man anthony adams corleone in the uniform of a midshipman of the naval academy
we are pulling back as the speaker who is arne grundellius the secretary of state continues his accent faintly scandinavian
there are no limits to the goals to which we can each legitimately aspire
and now as an unpopular war is ended in east asia and we set our sights on new goals i leave you with the words of another sailor we continue
to pull back to discover that we are at the navy and marine corps stadium
it is a late spring day and in the early middle nineteen seventies
the midshipmen their parents and guests are gathered for the graduation ceremonies
our will is to keep the torch of freedom burning for all
to this solemn purpose we call on the young the brave and the strong and the free
heed my call
come to the sea
come sail with me
i sure the entire ricade of mid shimen recogr zes the words o john p
aui vo nes during this speech we find we have been
moving through the stadium
we find tonys mother ray among the guests
we also see tonys sister mary about twenty tom hagen and al neri
the speech is over and as the audience applauds the superintendent of the academy crosses an to grundellius
thank you lister secretary as the secretary of state crosses back to his seat the superintendent addresses the microphone
dent the following first classmen will step forward to receive their diplomas
the superintendent consults a list which an aid has supplied the superintendent reads off
the first to names then trident scholar anthony adams at the sound of his name tony rises and moves toward the speakers platform
we the final first classman has received the final diploma and is
moving off as a midshipman runs up to center stage and
in accordance with long tradition i propose three cheers for those about to leave us
the brigade answers with a roar the brigade answers for the th i
rd time aid as the mid sh pma
runs cff his lace is taken by a represen by tat
ve of the graduating class
i propose three cheers for those we leave behind
hip hip hip hip
ea ar g tony as the graduating midshipmen give their last full throated response and skim their hats into the air tony half a beat behind the others does like
we pull back and pan upward to the explosion of white hats arching through the air
we pick up a man named stu palmateer moving th rough the group of strolling midshipmen and their guests
palmateer is a poised pleasant tough man abcut forty dressed in the unifora of a marine caotai
n he spots tony in a group with his guests near the statue of tecumseh
tony is standing with kay mara hagen and al nexi
tony turns as congratulations tony

nods then see you all tonight
tony kisses his mother and he and palmateer move off
we pick up a car coming along the washington beltway approaching the cia turnoff near langley virginia
we pan with it then continue to pan over to a road sign which reads central intelligence agency
palmateer is driving
tony sits next to h
they make the turnoff to the cia go up the access road come to a stop at the entrance
as the marine guard comes out of the guardhouse and up to the car palmateer is taking out his identification
palmateer and tony on foot now move up to the build ing
they move through the front doors
we are in he gigantic foyer of the cia building
the camera is focused on the cia motto etched boldly into the white marble wall
it reads ye shall m tow t we pan off the motto to pick up palnateer and tony as they move through the great columned rcom toward the desk at

palmateer initials the form she gives him as she gives tony his pass and stamps it in large letters rust i
cia btjilaing lobby day within the foyer is another crate separating the foyer from the inner sanctum of the building itself
we are on the gate guards as they check the badges and passes of those entering
they nod palmateer and tony through the gate
we pan them toward the bank of varicolored elevators
as they go to the elevators we hear this is a
preliminary interview not binding on either party
the next step if its agreed to take that step would be a session with the assessment and evaluation sec tion
ends with a polygraph test
we are on the elevator doors as they open and palmateer and tony emerge
they walk down the corridor with its bare off white walls
the floors are covered with green vinyl

an accordian tube around the chest to measure changes in breathing rhythms a hand held device with electrodes which measures changes in perspiration or galvanic skin response

the president of the union patrick brady a large red faced hearty man comes bursting out of a door and crosses up to hagen and neri
come in this way
i to secretary no calls maggie

thats beside the point
act is those days are over when danny used to hand it out like so much free lunch
theres been a big reduction in our c fitment to new construction loans
how long has that policy been in effect
let me read you something
as brady withdraws a newspaper cut out obviously an editorial from the folder
s its headed take the hcod out of the brotherhood
is precisely men like patrick brady who took over the pres idency of the i d when the former president danny devito was packed off to prison who must be
watched by the sec
because of the tremen dous economic power of the anion pension funds these men with their syndicate connections are putting the underworld in a position to dominate the american economy
what more can i tell vou
you can tell me if the answer is yes or no
as brady crosses to the a
arge srt dio por trai
t of danny devito a tcugh lcok zc ctle tay conti itv
is framed in a place of honor
after a moment brady shakes his head and turns back to hagen
tm sorry tom
such as i love and respect cur former president i dont have any burning urge to end up rooming with him at leavenworth
before you give me your final re fusal
id like to say one thing youve just had my final refusal hagen
the answer is no
i another anglz as hagen looks at brady for a moment then starts putting papers back into his briefcase

hagen turns back
brady comes up with the genco inte
r national loan application
take this along with you in case you run out of toilet paper on the flight back to vegas
agen takes the application from brady then cuietly e gr dont ever think that the corleone tamily is finished mister brady
that would be a mistake
hagen and neri now turn and exit
brady is looking after them
gradually the bravado drains from his big pink irish face and he crosses to the telephone and picks it up

the limousine drives onto the ferry
custne night frankie is listening to the baseball scores
neri is nervously checking his watch
a few passengers are boarding
there are no other cars
salf a dozen loose puerto rican kids come bopping up the automobile deck
one is listening to a radio that he holds to his ear
he crosses up to frankie
hey mister you got a cigarette

as neri who hasnt been paying attention to the kids now looks up in annoyance
give him a suddenly veri breaks cg
sensing something wrong
the other puerto ricans are surrounding the limousine

the ferry whistle is blowing
neri its the deck a

one of the puerto rican kids is hit squarely in the chest
he flies back azms up legs sz readea gi d like he was hit in the chest with a baseball bat
prankie is out of the car reaching for his gun
before he can get it clear he is hit in the shoulder and spun to the splintery oily deck
as a puerto rican goes to finish off frankie al neri blows him away
as two other puerto ricans blast neri simultaneously
neris eyes go wide
a big stringy sob of blood appears in his mouth vomits out onto his shirtfront
he goes down to his knees tries to raise his grin for one last shot
a puerto rican grins and putting his gun
an inch from neris face pulls thetrigger
people are screaming running
theferry is starting to pull from the dock
the four remaining puerto ricans run for the end of the boat make the leap over the churning water from the ferry to the landing
the ferry boat is still pulling away as the our puerto ricans land on t h e he pier and disappear into the night
the ferry boats whistle is blowing shrilly

santino whose attitude has been somewhat sardonic throughout now breaks out in a bray of laughter

our technical services division is experimenting in two areas
one is a scuba diving wet suit designed to malfunction at a critical depth
the other is a toxic biological material a strain of botulism thats tasteless colorless and odorless and so lethal that one drop on his food or an his toothbrush would

as xrankie starts to rise hagen puts a stop to any further discussion
we all agree except santino that what tony proposes is possible although not
of course financial arrangements will have to be worked out theres no problem there
every thing will be handled through me and in cash
you can tell your friends that they have a deal
tell them this too what the corleone family wants for its part in this operation is the uncondi tional pardon of danny devito
and that will have to come first
i dont know if theyll accept that
its a non negotiable condition
well start getting things lined up but we wont move until danny walks out of leavenworth

as tony comes into the room palmateer gives him a pen and a couple of pieces of paper
a couple of things for you to sign before you go operational
this is for your piece and this is your resignation
its a technicality but in case the shit ever really hits the fan wed have p to disclaim you

the first man turns to him speaking in a whisper
bring him down here
we follow him as very softly he goes down the hallway
as he pauses
outside the bedroom door which is half p ajar
now suddenly he moves idii
bedrcom night we are angled on the hall
door as in a single move the second man kicks the door open and flicks the bedroom light on
he has his gun pointed at the bed
we whip pan to the bed
as for a frozen moment
surprise and consternation show an his face
at this point dont make a noise
just stand where you are or ill kill you
we have pulled back and panned slightly to include tony who is sitting on the
floor his back against the wall
the gun in
his hand is trained on the man who has just come in
as the second man stands motionless tony is on
his feet and up to him
tony takes the qua from him and tossing it an the bed gestures forefinger to lips be quiet
now tony turns to the man and
starts down the hall with him
tony has him by the back of the jacket his tun pressed against the back of the second mans head

kneeling man plunges for qard dead the back of his head blown off
tony now turns without emotion to the man with the knife
thats what youre going to look like in two seconds if you harm that girl
as the first man drops his knife and releases elizabeth she is locking at tony stunned her aplomb totally vanished
go get dressed and call the police
elizabeth nods and half stumbles out of the room
tony crosses to the man
when the cops come youre going to be up on a murder rap baby

tony lifts the gun and blasts the first man three times in the chest
as elizabeth bursts bac k into the room looks then starts to scream
tony crosses up and taking her in his arms softly comforts her
its all right
he tried to get my gum away and i had to shoot him
tony still comforting her moves her away we we are in a swampy backwater on the west coast of florida south at fort meyer

as santino turns and goes we we are as the sky over the bay of armando vidals capitol
it is the fifth anniversary of his revol ution and a fireworks display is taking place over the bay
sky rockets are arching upward over the waters exploding in cascades of red green and gold
we are on an impromptu exhibition on a street corner
a big marvelous looking black girl in almost nothing circles with a lean latino almost touching but not quite in a hip grinding mambo
as the crowd laughs and cheers them on
we move up to a loud speaker attached to an ornate and bunting festooned
from the speaker we hear but make no mistake any of you you of the north american delega tion in particular
we welcome you to our count y but the days of exploitation are over
dal is speaking to a crowd j
n the grand allrcomm
the usual tel
evisicn cameras so or
as the predominantly latin american crowd cheers we pick out tony in civilian clothes amongst
the cheer ing people
the blood of our martyrs is still too fresh on our pavement
we will be friends and neighbors but never again slaves to imperialism
a young latino and we will recognize him as ar igo has moved to tonys side
as the cheers have erupted once more amigo witha brief nod of the head indic ates that tony shouldfol ow him
as arrigo goes tony looks after him briefly then over to the american delegation including lucas the assistant secretary of state for latin american affairs cariock the speaker of the
house and several prominent liberal senators including mckissick of utah and the elegant harthaiemew of pennsylvania
also in the delegation in uniform is stu palmateer
the older mans eyes meet with tonys for a brief moment
he has seen the exchange
he watches as tony leaves then looks over toward u agudo vidals chief of police
the harsh heavy policeman is laugh ing at something vidal has said seemingly paying no attention to tonys exit
as tony is crossing the lobby elizabeth ann dunne followed by a small entourage enters
half a pace behind her is kenny morton her producer and behind them are three men carrying portable tv equipment cameras tripods batteries so on
she is speaking to e
with all due respect thats bull shit
the mans obviously inccm petent or the car wcu d have been she breaks cf f
seei nc tony
ee crosses up r thought you werent coming down here
she doesnt answer
arent we speaking
elizabeth crosses off toward the desk tony looks after her for a moment puzzled then crosses out
as tony comes out of the hotel and crosses the garden grounds toward the street we see that a fireworks display is still in progress
throngs of merry makers are moving along the wide palm lined avenue that follows the curve of the bay
many are in cost e
some play instruments
others have bongo drums
the atmosphere is frenetic
a pervasive beat
the whole city seems to throb with it
we are on arrigo who stands outside the flaw of traffic cigarette in his mouth patting his pockets for a match

in closer to tony
a big fat mama comes out of a doorway shakes everything she has at him
tony grins pats her on the ass and passes by we are on the part of the harbor where the big fishing boats tie up
the sound of the celebration is fainter now a couple of blocks distant
we are on an old but seaworthy fishing boat the name on the stern is stelia
amigo comes up the pier pauses by the short gangway
as tony comes up and joins axr igo a third man suddenly appears out of the darkness
as he comes up to tony we recognize jorge baxcenas

jorge leads them aboard
in the cabin are roberto barcenas indio
araron padre pepeand borracho
there is also a girl angelica
she has dark eyes and blonde hair
there is some thing faintly flashy but also enormously sensual about her
one man is cleaning a stripped automatic rifle
another is loading a banana
clip with calibre bullets
barcenas the girl and some others are bent over a map on the mess table
cook up as tony jorge and arrigo enter
t tobertc smiles warm canes up and embraces tony

as tony unbuttons his shirt and strips off a money belt which he puts on the table and opens
iie takes out some money
a hundred thousand pesos cash

as roberto takes up the money and counts it
tony takes out a small vial in a plastic container
its tasteless and odorless but it has a vet
short period of tox ic
ty do you understand
once s opened it must be used within twenty four hours
how soon does it work
the symptoms are those of botulisat
high fever nausea vomiting and death
within an hour

as anjelica turns her coat swings open slightly and we see that she is dressed in a costume
a typical tropicana showgirl kind of thing
when we meet again things will be better
be careful of agudos fishermen
theyre out in force tonight
roberto hands her the money then kisses her on
vaya can dios chica
she staffs the money in the pocket of the overcoat and exits
roberto looks at a
rigo who nods and follows her out
vow roberto looks back at tony

s been set urz
jorge crosses to a map on the table
as tony crosses and studies the map we the celebration on vidals capitol is still in progress in this small city park
suddenly a police truck appears in one of the streets blocking it and a fly ing squad of armed police piles out of the canvas covered rear and
the sergente blows his whistle
have your cards ready
rigo and anj el ca moving through the crowd
they stop exchange a look and then turn and move the other
way we follow them through the crowd to a small alley
amigo and anjelica and a couple of others who would apparently just as soon not be stopped by the police move down the alley
as anjelica and arrigo move down the alleyway con gratulating themselves on their escape from magudos men suddenly three policemen materialize out of the darkness ahead
not so fast my friends against the wall pockets inside out
you too blondie
half a dozen of the disreputable fish that have been caught in magudos net are sitting on a bench against the bare dirty walls of the bare high ceilinged room
with its one unshaded bulb hanging from the ceiling illuminating the suspects and police alike harshly
on one side of the room is a barred tank or holding cell
there is a fat capitan behind the desk and another policeman pockmarked and hawkish looking working an some papers at another desk
the sergente comes in with anjelica and arrigo
this is an outrage i protest ser a
e sit down
the sergente shoves arrigo violently toward the bench as we we are on the doors of the hotel as tony enters and crosses the large lobby toward the elevators
over in one corner of the lobby we see palmateer in a group with several others of the united states delegation
tony raises a hand to palmateer who nods back as tony continues toward the elevators
as the desk clerk who has been watching the door signals over to a uniformed security officer
the security officer nods and crosses to intercept tony
as he does so senor adams
the u sing security officer crosses p to m
there is a message for you

hotel de la revolucion bar night the place is reasonably crowded even at this hour
we are on elizabeth ann dunne who is the center of a small circle of admirers including kenny morton

palmateer crosses to the elevator as tony moves back toward the barroom

jorge arcenas is at a public phone

the policeman nods
troberto turns to tony

jorge start passing out weapons and hand grenades
tony takes a su
machine gun and checks it as we
a couple of policemen are on duty on the jailhcuse roof
their names are lopez and ruiz
is look ing into the square
we are shooting down into the square from behind lopez as ruiz comes up and joins him
we see the two cars stop outside the jail and the occupants pile out
tony jorge roberto and indio from the first car sorracho pepe and araron from the second
they are all armed carrying law rockets and slung sub machine guns
as he jumps up onto the parapet cocks his own machine gun and fires down into the square
as his bullets stitch the cobblestones moving up toward the group
at the sound of ruiz s first shot hes got his sub machine gun in his hands
he fires from the hip
lopez throws up his hands falling back
ruiz spins on the parapet and falls into the street
carbajal and mosca have started firing out of the gun ports in the doors
tee street outside the jail night as indio gets hit in the forehead and is jolted back wards his face a bloody mask tony jorge and roberto have picked up
their laws and fire almost simultaneously
as the big heavy doors blow away ins
ii an as the second door is blown back into the roc
the ceiling is caving in piaster is falling
the ai is thick with plaster dust and smoke
mosca sits against the wall mouth open
his leg lies across the room
the prisoners in the holding cage are screaming
a policeman runs in from another room just in time to be cut down by jorge who bursts through the door followed by tony and roberto
as colonel magudo runs up the basement stairs pistol as jorge tony and roberto all ire at the same time blowing magudo back down the basement stairs
tony and the others dive down the stairs
as the occupants of the first car are attacking the jailhouse fa axon pepe and borracho launch an attack on the presidential palace
the sleepy soldiers come tumbling cut of the build ing in confusion barracho is spraying them with his automatic weapon while the other two are blowing the front doors away
with their rockets
smoke and plaster dust is heavy in the square
rives start to lick and flicker

fararon run into the presidential palace somebody has started pealing the bells of the cathedral
as borracho pepe and fararon rjn into the great central hall wit its cu gyring s a
case and great crystal chan delie this way
eeo rugs up the stairway by the others
at the top of the stairs he turns fires at the chaia that holds the chandelier anchored
the ceiling chews away
the chandelier falls with a crash of crystal
basmient ci tral jail might there are a dozen doors leading into a dozen basement cells tony jorge and roberto are searching them
tony enters a cell then we hear roberto
as roberto hurries into the cell there is a gully in the ceiling with a line led
through it and tied off
the other end of the line is
tied around arrigos ankles suspending hi upside down
eris hands are tied behind him
his head and shoulders are not visible as he is immersed head down in a large tuh of water
roberto runs in whips out a knife and as tony grabs the motionless body the other cuts the line
as they gently lay arrigos body on the floor it is apparent he is dead
as jorge throws open a door his face goes white
mothey of god
we have panned over to the door
we are now shooting toward the door with our view mainly blocked out but we can see that anjelica is dead naked and tied spread eagled face down on a

as eararcn cuts the soldier down then turns to pepe lets get out of here
they turn and ran
a couple of police vehicles and an army truck careen into the square skid to a stop and the soldiers and policemen pile out and take cover an the square
the bodies of ruiz and indio are still where they fall
at a command from the officer in charge the soldiers and policemen start moving forward from cover to cover laying down a steady rattle of gunfire
jorge roberto and tony are running along an alley in the darkness bent over
one street away in the town square apparently all hell is breaking loose
as they run hey this way
fara cn and epe are standing in mouth of a i
tp e n ar r cw open ig between houses
as pepe and fararon disappear into the darkness follow ed by tony roberto and jorge
a police car with the numerals painted on the side is abandoned at an angle in the street the doors open
pepe runs up looks in
tony and the others follow
the keys are gone
tony is under the dashboard crossing the wires as the others start piling in
the motor starts tony slides behind the wheel
as they drive off tony is driving
roberto is next to him in the front seat
in the back are jorge pepe and rararon
as they come to a crossroads which way
when will the plane be coming
they will land at quebrada
roberto looks at his watch then we can make it
as police car number comes left around the corner a second police car is coming the other way
the two cars barely miss each other just kissing as they pass
the comandeered police car swerves as tony fights the wheel and finally steadies it
tonys point of vt
w througe back window the other police car has spun and stalled momentarily
as the driver of the car gets it started and straightened out in pursuit we can see the second policeman on the hand mike
we can hear his excited voice in
spanish coming over the police radio
we have seen the terrorists
they are in police car twenty too going north on avenue of the martyrs
terrorists seen going north on avenue of the martyrs
now other traffic can be heard on the police radio as other police cars respond to the message
of various police cars as they get the message
some swing around in q turns their sirens are winding up to a howl
we are shooting back through windshield
pepe is look ing out the back window and we see the following police car
now another joins it
now still another
police men start firing out of their
the back window is starred as a hole suddenly appears in it only inches from padre
ece s head
he looks at the ho l e and tu
esus mary and joseph
d cis n ved as another bullet hits the car somewhere with a clang
of metal roberto turns td tony go right on quebrada
as the pursuing police cars increase their numbers and come closer the comandeered car carrying tony and the others makes a right turn on avenue quebrada leading out of town
parked at the curb is a non descript sedan
as he drives we see that roberto has taken from his knapsack pouch a mall detonating device such as we have seen in the demonstration of the doomsday car at
as the first of the pursuing police cars starts around the corner suddenly the non descript sedan parked at the curb detonates disintigrates in a blinding dazzle of light
in the jolt of the shock wave every window within half a mile radius shatters
a vast ball of flame and black heavy smoke billows upwards from the corner where the doomsday vehicle and the first car were immolated
now the following police cars unable to stop and unable to avoid the flames which have spread like napalm all over the whole corner skid into the flames and smoke
plowing into the wreckage
the buildings are in flames
a policeman his uniform and hair on fire runs screaming out of the inferno
ce car nunber tarns down a side road through a gate then up and over a h

air field f ca
quebrada night a the police car comes to a stop at the side of what is apparently a hacked out landing strip in the middle
of a small valley
there is a cane field on one side the green stalks are give or six feet high
tony jorge roberto and pepe get out of the car
roberto opens the back door and to fararon
do you want to roberto has broken off as he looks at fararon
we realize that sometime during the chase the pharoah has taken a bullet in the chest
ses dying and pink bubbles of blood fora and break on his lips as he stiizggles for breath
im sorry old friend
tony crosses and gets back into the car to help fararon
im afraid hes finished
at this point we hear here they come as jorge pepe and roberto run to the center of the airstrip looking upward
we can hear the sound of an approaching aircraft
as he points a flashlight at the sky and signals a short and a long the letter alpha
alnctrer a igl
e i ic r ng he oc the aircraft is now visible
rcm the pilots coc pit we see the answering signal a long and th ee shorts the letter bravo
as it swings in on the final approach and starts to settle in for a landing
a couple of jeep loads of soldiers turn down the same side road that we saw police car take a few minutes earlier
as the jeep loads of soldiers pass through the gate on which are the words finca quebrada we ct
t to the dc lands and swings around taxing bark
over the rough ground
he senses something wrong and pausing by the edge of the airfield calls to the at tars
wait a minute
as they run for the plane
as the plane swings around again and the door opens
we reveal erankie rizzi in the doorway
as he looks out
as they ran toward
rim of the ett
as the two jeeps come up to the rim of the hill
one jeep turns a powerful spotlight onto the airfield
irpt t fl night as the spotlight catches roberto pepe and jorge in its beam
as they fire
as they are chopped down one after the other
as he turns and fires at the jeep loads of soldiers with his automatic rifle
as tonys fire shatters the spotlight
some soldiers fall others fire at the dc

armando vidal his face a harsh mask stands in the shattered doorway of the presidential palace looking off toward the central square
the cetinter revolution has failed
people once more did not rise up as expected
battle torn square outside the jailhouse we see an angry croard of rioters care ing the dead and bloody body of roberto barcenas
and once more the rich are bewilder ed by the fact that the poor are un i willing to die for them
somebody produces a rope somebody else throws a loop around his feet and roberto is hoisted upside down to the top of an ornate old lam post
and while e presidente was speak ing in understandable bitterness crowds in the capitol were running rampant stringing up the bodies of the leaders of the failed coup detat
as the people cheer
somebody produces an american flag and sets it afire
it buns in the street
lids kick at it l it on it
they burned american flags and threatened the safety of the amer uniformed soldiers with fixed bayonets are guarding the airfield
crowds are gathered outside the gates
as limousines ith soldiers on the enders and roofs come inching through the fist waving threatening mob
as the gates are opened soldiers with bayoneted rifles force the crowds back so that the cars can get through who were taken to the airfield under military escort
we see the limousines stop by a waiting transport plane and with the guns of the soldiers holding off the angry mob the american delegation to vidals celebration hurries into
the big airliner
in the american group we see elizabeth ann dunne the senators mckissick and barthalemew assistant secretary lucas speaker of the house cari
ock and stu palmateer looking cooler than he could possibly feel
over this soldiers with bayonets were forced to fight off the angry mob which clearly blamed the united states for the abortive coup
as are r

meanwhile in the nations capitol arne grvndellius the secretary of state was beseiged by newsmen as he left the state depa

tony dressed as last we saw him at the airfield is in elizabeths apartment watching the news on
her liv ing room television set

sound of a key in the front door
he rises and turns as elizabeth enters carrying a paper bag

a couple of oranges roll across the rug as im sorry i had to talk to you she looks at him her expression almost readable as anger youre listed as

suddenly elizabeth drops to her knees and starts crawling around on the floor blindly searching for the oranges
as he locks at her for a puzzled moment then drops to his own knees and taking her by the shoulders straightens her
tears are pouring down her cheeks
bey wait a minute he kisses her
this crying shit
she smiles sniffles blinks the tears out of her eyes you want an egg sandwich

as they drive down bourbon street augusta leans for ward to the chauffeur
well go in the back way

there have been no ransom demands and the devito family although concerned are not yet alarmed
police have stationed a guard on the ex union leaders bayonne new jersey home were his rife and groom daughter are in seclusion
informed sources fear an eruption of mob violence if the popular labor leader has met with foul play

as a big car driven by a button an named fritz pu
rocco opens the door to the backseat gestures tony in
as tony gets in i he looks around
there is a car full of button men in front of them
another car full of button men behind
gets a nod back rom each driver
as tony gets into the backseat we see that tom hagen is there
rocco lampone now gets into the front seat alongside the driver fritz
tony this is fritz

a e eagef s car in the middle

they found him in a barrel at the mouth of the mississippi
its going to be bad for a while that s wby i wanted you out here
its time you jesus christ fritz this last as another car swings out of a side street and a hood leans out of the rear window with a t
relve gauge p p gun and blasts at fritz
as a blast of heavy shot takes out the windshield and blows most of fritzs head away
sagrzn s car as a fountain of blood gushes up from the stalk of fritzs neck and hagens car starts to swerve into the curbing the gunman in the other
car sends two more blasts of deer load into hagens car
as the corleone button men in the following car blasts at the attackers the shotgun man blasts away

the caw hits and tolls
the hagen car comes to a s tor on its wheels again

as rocco lampone comes out of the wreckage the button men are pulling tony who is unconscious out
lampone looks at fritz and hagen
not a goddamned thug you can do for them
lets get out of here
as the corleone men carry tony to the other ca and get him inside people are starting to gather
its all right
its all right
were getting him to the hospital
mans hurt here
clear the road
as the bystanders move back the corleone car burns rubber and digs out mt
bedroom corleone compoiinf tahoe nigtt camera is subjective the screen is pitch black with a single red orange dot moving erratically in the center
it is the coal of a cigarette as someone takes a last puff tamps it out then scratches a match and
in the flare of the match we see a nurses bulldog face
he wears a bandage around his head like a burban
be is looking at the nurse in the flicker of the match flame
who are you
od youre awake
wait a minute
ill be right back
the nurse has risen
she switches on a lamp and exits
anothr angle mirror shot we are angled into a mirror over a chest of drawers holding on tony as he sits up in bed then gingerly gets to his feet
he is wearing silk pajamas
now he crosses to the mirror and checks himself out
aside from the bandage he seems to be in one piece
now in the mirror we see the door open and silhou etted in the doorway the figure of michael
anotffer angl as tony and michael look at one another for
a long moment
how are you feeling
what am i doing here
as michael comes into the room and closes the door i had rocco bring you
hows the head
a little pain
the doctor says its nothing
to bother you but ive always found its easier to be brave about some body elses headache
did he say how soon t could leave
tony doesnt sit down
rd like to get out of here as soon as possible
let me ask you a question
have you any idea where you stand
im not totally stupid
i ac t think youre stupid
i think youre smart
t not smart enough
tn willing to learn
youve let your enemies get too close to you
those people who tried to kill you in las vegas they were maatrocinas people
are you sure
michael answers that question with a look of course in sure
the question to ask is this who knew you were flying to las vegas
the girl i was staying with and tony breaks off someone f cm langley
before i left i called a man named stuart
cony r ed
i told tom hagen god rest his soul but i warned him
it was a
mistake that whole vidal business
as the only contact between our people and the government you had no protec tion
you were naked
it they want to break the contact they elimirate you and theyre clean
as long as youre alive
youre a threat do you understand
as tony sits
hes not sure whether he likes or trusts or is ready to forgive his father but he knows the sound of good sense when he hears it
how long do you think the administra tion would last if it were to come out that the president used the corleone family to assassinate the head of a foreign
the question is rhetorical
michael takes out a cigar and goes about the ceremony of lighting it
im not supposed to smoke these things but it isnt every day a mans son comes home
you were saying
every year on february third ive sent you a check
those ohecks were never cashed would you like to
rve always know why and z res pect your reasons
but neverthe less im your lather and anything t have is yours if its money you want my friendship the benefit of my experience if youll accept it
i i need your advice
nods then there are two ways i see to handle this
first i can make you dis appear in
sicily until everything blows over
men get old and angers cool
in four or five years you could probably be safe to come home again
whats the other way
the other way is a gamble that you could lose
and it would mean becoming a part of the family for a while anyway
tony is just looking at michael
think about it
sleep on it
well talk again in the morning
tony enters the glassed in boathouse
outside cold white winter and the deep blue lake
with hi is a sezvant
your father will be out in a moment
theres coffee on the sideboard
the ser want exits
y crosses to the sideboard pours a cup of coffee
as he t uzmns with it his eyes fall on a table in the corner on which ccdn v e
are many pictures mostly in heavy silver frames
some are studio portraits
some are grainy blow ups of snapshots
tony crosses to the table of pictures
as tony looks we are moving from picture to picture
the first is a wedding portrait taken on connies wedding day
carlo is kissing the bride
the god father stands proud and uncom
fortable in his tuxedo
michael in his uniform
the twins all heavy eyebrows and baby fat
here is a picture of sonny with his fists up and laughing as if about to hit someone
there is a photograph of the three brothers sonny michael and redo their arms around each other at an outing someplace
sonny is in the middle of a big grin
fredo looks shy and scared
michael is staring straight ahead a boyish smile on h s face although his eyes are cold
there is a picture of michael and ray at tonys con firmation
there is a blown up snapshot of the godfather in his tomato garden in the backyard
as he picks up the picture of the godfather remem the old don is tending his tomato vines
with him is the little boy tony
aged three or four
they have the special rapport that sometimes exists be tween the old and the very youzg
they play teasing games with paper fangs and the bug spray can then suddenly the old mans heart ailed him and he falls i n to the tomato vines
after a moment the lit le boy understands that the old man is no l anger playing a game and he beomes frightened int
tife boathoiisz day we are on the door as michael enters
he pauses for a moment then do you remember your grandfather
as tony turns from the table full of pictures with his grandfathers framed portrait still in his hand
as tony puts down the picture michael comes up
do you remember him with admira tion and respect
z remember that i loved him
so did i
ive been thinking about these choices
michael holds up his hand to delay the decision
talk with me for a moment
let me learn something about my son
whats trident scholar
its a special honors program for first classmen
you liked annapolis
enough to make a life in t e navy
not that much
was surprised you didnt go to dartmouth
i thought about it but kay wanted me to go to annapolis and the price was right
hows hanover these days
about the same
i always liked that town
that s where z met your mother when i was going to school up there
id planned to live there you know
teach maybe or go into law
little office on wheelock street
deeds and wills
i would have liked that
why didnt you do it
because one day a sicilian pimp and dope peddlar named virgil solla o tried to assassinate my father your grandfather and i had to do something about it
it was a mistake
s took a road
the wrong road for me
it ended here
is this so bad
sa dont know
it depends or
what you call terrib
you have to michael cant d live a certain way a cold way or you wont live long
do you remember your uncle credo
redo the fisherman
ill always remember he had a secret way to catch fish
he taught me
you say a hail
mary before you put the line down
it never fails
you know what happened to
he died didnt he
i had him killed
my own brother
it was something r had to do or felt i had to
he went against the family
so i waited until our mother died and then i breaks off not too many people are fitted for this kind of a life
ive had to do mazy hard things but sending you and your sister away that was the hardest
there is a beat
to and his father look at each other and for a moment we feel that tony is going to cross to his father then the moment passes and now that
ive said t at id like to hear your decision
i dont th
il k id
ike sicil v
come sit with me
time is short and i have a lot to tell you
t n t
cia building lobby day as tony in civilian clothes passes through the inner checkpoint with his legitimate credentials
morehouse and palmateer are in the office
their atti tudes are
less than cordial as tony enters
come in adams sit down
ive called stu in on this though im afraid i cant give you much time
ive got a brief ing with the z orty committee at noon
what i have to say wont take long
and i think we all be happier if its not on tape
morehouse pauses a moment then openens a drawer and switches ofd his tape machine
sows your health
i understand you got a crack on the head
im fine now
you were up at your fathers place in tahoe
t at d s rig
has he changed much
not as much as i d
i remember him very well from the senate hearings on crime
heat little man
very polite spoke in a soft reasonable voice
he sat there with two million dollars worth of legal talent at his elbow and told the united states government to go piss up a rope
you had to admire the pretentious little bastard
were wasting each others time with this mister morehouse
all right son
this is your party
youve got five minutes
but before we start im not going to listen to a lot of recriminations about that cveration
your people blew it pure and sim le
it was totally mishandled
a mistake from beginning to end
the big mistake was that im still alive
youd managed to get rid of me down there or in vegas you d be all right
silt its too late now
youve lost your chance
i dont know what the hell youre talking about
c di i
if anything should happen to me anything at all you can find out
the full story will be all over the six oclock news
id like to hear your conception of the full story
you were running a no lose operation
if we succeeded you were rid of vidal
if we failed the corleone family was set up to take the blame
your hands were clean
i was the only one who could dispute your story and i wasnt supposed to come back
ive found out that my res ignation from the navy was processed and accepted a full week before i went down here stu
well yes sir
his resignation did go through but it was a snafu a yeomans mistake thats all
a clerical error
and i dont buy it
dont give a shit if you buy it or not
and ill tell you some thing else mister adams or what ever your fucking name is i dont react favorably to blackmail
its not blackmail
its a simple statement of fact
if anything happens to me or if the corleone family is damaged iz these senate hearings then the whistle blows and the whole zdmin
st ation aces
and what makes you think t
give a shit about what happens to the admin istration
morehouse grins without humor
tonys eyes flicker
morehouse has told something that tony needed to know
morehouse is up and coming around the desk as he continues
whatever i did was done under dix ect orders from the president of the united states and i
so testify in open hearing
if that upsets some of you guinea gumbarrs in nevada then so be it
the days are over when your father and his like could corrupt and intimidate this nation
youve taken over the job
your five minutes are up now get the hell out of here
as tony turns and goes morehouse glares after him the glint of victory in his eyes
we axe outside the huge senate caucus room
the double doors are open and inside we can see the preparations for the hearing
the senators are taking their seats the press is being given the press hand out stamped embargoed until witness testifies

the ax has fallen from his hands

a memo here from the director of the fbi to the director of the cia with copies to the army air force navy and state department intelligence offices
it states that one of our informants well i l read it ro during
a recent conversation with several friends underworld figure sam maatrocina stated that there was going to be an attempt on armando vidal s life and this attempt this hit in
the argot was to be carried out by another underworld did this informant identify the other underworld family
so sir he did not
would you care to speculate just a minute senator i whole heartedly object to this committee being used as a for for spec ulation based on an anonymous report of
an alleged conversation
could be recklessly and i e grievably damaged
very well very well
we wouldnt want to damage any of the constituency of my esteemed collegue from nevada
many thanks to the distinguished sv
nior senator from our wes tern sister state of utah
maatrocina s office new york city day sam maatrccina is seated in his office on the thirty third floor of an old downtown manhattan office build ing
the buzzer sounds
a couple of gentlemen here from the internal revenue mister maatrocina
the internal revenue
send em in
the door buzzes open and
two young rather conserva tive looking men enter with briefcases
maatrocina is coming around the desk what is this
some kind of a roust
its about your income tax sir
my taxes are handled by the biggest firm of accountants in new york city
it costs me a hundred thousand doll ars a year and you two assholes in cheap suits are going to come in here sam maatroci
na breaks off
the second young man has hit him an open handed karate chop on the side of the neck
now before maatroctna can speak or cry cut the aan has hit taatrocina a seccad chop shat ter
ag his adams apple
as maatrocina goes to his knees his eyes goggling the first young man has crosses to the window and opened it
now he and the second young man carry the wide eyed new york don to the window and throw him out
as crowds are gathering around the body of maatrocina on the sidewalk the two men come out of the building cross the street and go around the corner
in the distance sound of approaching sirens
as the two men come around the corner and get into a waiting car
driving the car is frankie rizzi
as they drive off we it is late afternoon
a uitness general vanderhorst the director of the cia is at the table
geary is quizzing him
what im trying to get from you general is as director of the central zntelligence agency did you ever have any kind of order in writing authorizing you to assass
inate the head of a foreign state
z did not
well come on now
thats hardly the thing that would be put in writing now is it
well what would it be put n aol writ q
x suggest that it would be put into the same kind of phraseology that henry used to his barons when he said will no one rid me of this turbulent
he didnt tell them to go kill thomas z beckett
but the final result of it was murder in the cathedral what has thomas
beckett got to do
witii the subject at hand
if the distinguished senator from nevada will refrain from ba halemew is beating with the gavel on his desk
tony is buying a hot dog at one of the dog wagons on the mall
as crosses and sits on a bench where palmateer is sunning himself looking at a newspaper
as tony takes a bite of his hot dog
these are good
you ought to stave one
i dont have a lot of time tony
first i wanted to say that although im sure that i was set um to be killed down there i never thought you were mixed up in i t
clad to hear that
now what was it that you wanted
cnt tc rd
z hear that morehouse is being called in by the commi tree to testify
so they tell me
well if he does and
im telling you this as a friend hes going to bring the roof down on him self and you too
lmateer puts the newspaper down looks at tony thats definite stu
we pick up an automobile moving south along a road that edges chesapeake bay
we see that tom morehouse is driving
we are angling through the front
windshield as he turns off into a marina parking lot
as morehouse comes out onto the float then climbs aboard
a nice little yawl apparently his own
as morehouse goes to the cabin
the snap lock has been unlocked and the hatchway is open
there is a dim light in the cabin
yr down here
as morehouse comes down the four steps that lead into the cabin then stops
palmateer and rocco lampone are waiting for him in the cabin
what the hell is this
as rocco rises drawing a twenty two calibre pistol with silencer and shoots morehouse three times in the chest
as morehouse goes down is he dead
palmateer kneels to check morehouse
so are you
i lampone had leaned down put the gun to palmateers head and pulled the trigger
a small coast guard patrol boat moves up chesapeake bay flat calm reflecting a pearly pink sky
as look out on the flying bridge scans the bay ahead then
i n to the sneaking tube
as the officer o the deck a yo
ng c a cs
that yawl looks like its adrift
as morehouses sailboat drifts in the calm its sails up and motionless its tiller untended
the patrol boat noses up ahoy the yawl
you all right
the bosun jumps aboard
if anybody down theres doing anything they shouldnt nows the time to tae bosun has looked down into the cabin
e breaks off and turns back to the patrol boat
get on the horn to base
we got two bodies here
sfylate caucus room day arne grundellius is at the witness table
and in conclusion id like to say that i believe these hearings have served a great good purpose
in spite of the fears that the hear ings would do hartto the fabric of democracy our nations stronger to day in the knowledge that we do not export revolution
or use murder as an extension of diplomacy
es geary and one or wwo others rise applatsd
another angle the at d ience tony and elizabeth are together
elizabeth is applaud ing grundellius
tony looks over at her
the meeting has broken up
spectators legislators news sian and womea
staff and committee members are leaving or standing in knots gossiping
we pick up elizabeth and tony as they cross out pausing to speak with senator geary and grundellius who have stopped to chat
mister secretary senator geary id like to present tony adams
there are general greetings and then as they move s toward the doors
i believe we have mutual friends in nevada mister adams
i believe so
if theres ever anything i can do you come see me
i might just take you up on that senator
as they exit it is sunset
tony and elizabeth are walking toward the capital building outlined against a pink sky
as they walk toward j
we begin to hear t
he gcdwa ther
we pick up the headlights of a car coming up the long approach driveway toward us
it comes past the gate past the kennels for the guard dogs past the guest houses and finally up to the main house where it stops
the front door to the house opens and michael stands silhouetted against the block of yellow light
tony gets out of the car and comes up to him
they embrace briefly and move into the house together
as the door closes behind them we start to move up and back
the sound of the single trumpet can still be heard playing slowly and sadly the notes faintly resonant as if echoing through the narrow streets of some old hill village
