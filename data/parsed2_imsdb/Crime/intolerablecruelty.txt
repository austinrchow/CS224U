screenplay by robert ramsey matthew stone ethan coen joel coen based on a story by robert ramsey matthew stone and john romano it is late night and deserted
engine noise approaches headlights appear as the car draws closer we hear singing
it is a mercedes convertible and as it roars by the singing a sloppy baritone and a giggling soprano whooshes by with it
we hold as another car approaches
this one is a conservative sedan whose occupant does not sing
the middle aged driver is in a tuxedo with a rumpled shirt and cocked bow tie
he is flushed a rogue forelock bouncing over his forehead and he merrily sings casey jones along with the passenger a young woman in a party dress who squeals rocks
with the motion of the car and enthusiastically pipes in on the chorus
the convertible makes a hot turn onto the street and approaches with its singing
the car enters and roars away
after a beat of quiet the conservative sedan enters and recedes
we are at the malibu guest quarters motel
the singing squealing mercedes screeches into the lot and rocks to a halt
the young woman staggers out still giggling and holding a half empty bottle of champagne
the man tosses her a key with a large plastic tag
she trots away
the man twists his rear view mirror to look at himself
he straightens his bow tie
he puffs his bounding forelock with one finger nods his head to make it bounce grins approvingly and cocks a pistol finger at his own reflection
the man enters and looks around
the young womans dress is tossed onto the bed but she is nowhere to be seen
the man pulls an imaginary train whistle
he looks around in a closet under the bed
im a locomotive baby
im the wabash cannonball
im a hunka hunka burninnnnn love
i got fire in my boiler and a fuh a fuh he is reacting to a long leg which pokes out from behind the window curtain
a salacious smiles spreads across his lips
he pulls on the cord to draw back the curtain and reveal the young woman in red panties and a bra and a saucily cocked conductors cap
the man is stripping off his clothes
excuse me miss is this the train to ecsssstasy
pull in your ears rexie youre comin to a tunnel
rex lunges at the young woman and they tumble onto the bed just as crash the door is kicked open and a short stocky black man built like a bulldog
and wearing a porkpie hat rushes into the room with a video camera glued to his eye
he looks like clarence thomas with a mustache
im gonna nail your ass
the young woman screams clutching the sheets to her naked bosom
rex leaps from the bed still clad only in his chemindefer boxers and darts around the room seeking egress
the man with the video charges around the room following rex rex is stumbling around the room in a panic looking for his clothing
the camera swish pans back to the young woman still screaming in the bed
im gonna nail your ass
we swish pan back to rex as he bends over to pick up his trousers mooning us
im gonna nail your ass
to reveal that we are in the detective gus petchs office
i nailed his ass
faintly from the television monitor we hear screaming and mayhem
watching the monitor marylin rexroth is a sensual beauty with intelligence and class
she watches the monitor without expression
i thought hed outgrown trains
gus petch sits behind a desk
they never grow up lady
they just get tubby
me ive always had ample proportions
but its all muscle im hard as a rock
im not on of these cream puff sit behind a desk private dicks im an assnailer so i see
faintly from the monitor im gonna nail your ass
we hear the young woman squeal
hard to believe thats the best he could do
probably youre the best he could do
youre takin it pretty well
i seen em weep like theyd hired me to prove their husbands werent fooling around
and i seen em celebrate
like i just handed em a winning lottery ticket
marylin turns her attention back to the screen
im just enjoying the movie
all from the perspective of a moving automobile
the moving shots show mansions palm trees boutiques we pass joggers strolling businessmen holding cellular phones to their ears male models working as waiters at sidewalk cafes young women on
roller blades who turn smile and wave at the camera
it is la dolce vita los angeles style
a handsome fortyish man in a town car talks into cellular phone
this is miles massey
hello marjory any messages
have wrigley look up oliphant v
oliphant for its relevance to the chapman filing
she took the kids where
which side of tahoe
if the cruise goes all the way around the lake she left the state and shes in breach
she cant leave the state
tell wrigley to prepare a filing to attach everything
primary residence autos stocks
put him through
beat hello ross
shes sleeping with the nanny
well youre separated
she can sleep with is this the one you slept with
interesting career choice
i know you want her dead
everyone in your tax bracket wants their ex wives dead
rex is trying his key in the front door of his house
finding it doesnt work he rattles the knob then leans on the doorbell
we hear distant chimes
finally through the intercom rex
get away from the door
look marylin cant we have a civilized discussion about this
and its winding down
but marylin you know a divorce would ruin me right now
everything i have everything we have is tied up in my business
the business is my entire life
are you forgetting about the atcheson topeka and the santa fe
i dont want to have to sic the dogs on you
from inside the house we hear the menacing sound of large on an interior wall it says massey meyerson sloan a pull back shows that we are in a waiting
room and a receptionist leans over her partition to chirp at rex rexroth
massey will be right with you
miles addresses a group of young attorneys at the firm
the problem is that everyone is willing to compromise
thats the problem with the institution of marriage its based on compromise
even through its dissolution
one attorney will try to score some points the opposition will try to impeach
the process will find an equilibrium point determined by the skill of the opposing lawyers and then each party will walk away with their portion of the goodies
some say life is compromise
but at massey myerson we believe life is struggle and the ultimate destruction of your opponent
the receptionist pokes her head into the conference room
your eleven oclock is here
ladies and gentlemen we will continue this at the associates meeting next friday
in the meantime i want you to consider this
ivan the terrible henry the viii attila the hun what did they have in common
as he exits
you may have seen it in the issue before last of world of interiors
theres a rothko on the wall an elle bleu humidor on the desk peonies in the vase and the diploma is from yale
please sit relax and consider this office your office your haven your war room for the duration of the campaign
he leans back in the leather executive chair behind his desk makes a steeple of his fingers and dons his look of deepest concern
tell me your troubles
rex nervous laughs ruefully
where do i start
miles gives an encouraging rueful smile in return
well my wife has me between a rock and a hard place
thats her job
you have to respect that
when i first met marylin well we were crazy about each other
not emotionally of course
we just couldnt keep our hands off each other
time marches on
it didnt exactly cool
marylin is a knock out
and very sexy but theres a lot of it out there
you know what i mean when i say it
no need to get anatomically correct with me rex
seems like theres more of it than ever before well with the expanding global population let me ask you this your wife
has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the knock out sexy woman you described
i dont know
i can assume
not in court you cant
has she retained counsel
im not sure
and your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities
and to cut to the chase forensically speaking is there a pre nup
rex hangs his head
miles sighs sympathetically
the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves
well let me ask you this what kind of settlement do you seek
what are for you the parameters of the possible
thats the problem
i cant afford to give her anything
i know that sounds rough but im about to close on a deal to develop some mini malls and im mortgaged up to my ass
if this deal goes south im ruined ill lose millions
so you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear
well is that possible
miles smiles at him
marylin power walks along the san vicente bike path with her friends sarah sorkin and ramona barcelona
its early but the path is crowded with bikers bladers runners power walkers wheelchair racers etc
ramona pushes her infant in a baby jogger
you want to come out to the beach house tomorrow
i didnt know barry had a beach house
neither did i until my lawyer found it quite a paper trail he had it in the dogs name
to marylin so whod you hire
shes a legend
didnt she do kravis or a pearlman
she definitely did a factor
she did a harriman
in the words of my private investigator were going to nail his ass
ive been trying to nail georges for years but hes very careful
ill just keep having children
i think im pregnant by the way
dont get mia farrow on us
three is not farrow
whos rexs guy
of massey myerson
do you know him
he got ann rumsey that cute little island of georges
george was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second
shes a night manager at mcdonalds
you should have tried to get pregnant marylin solidify your position
you like kids
i cant have a baby with a man i dont love
and i cant submit a child to divorce
its not so bad these days
kids like joint custody
two sets of toys
maybe next time
we do have a man for you
he just separated from his third
hes in fish
he is fish
shes keeping his name
and one of his planes
and all seven of his children and only two are hers
im not seeing anyone until this is over
one husband at a time
i wish i had your discipline
we are close on the person on the witness stand a woman in her s
guttman you have testified that you were your husbands sexual slave for thirty six years ever since you were married except for two years when he was in the navy
prior to your marriage what was your profession
i was a hostess
for trans world airlines
what is your husbands profession
he manufactures staples and industrial brad tacks
hes very successful
at the counsels table in the foreground miles chats voice lowered with wrigley a boyish bespectacled junior associate
beyond them we see the woman on the witness stand continuing her testimony
he wants to give her
and she has
what the fuck
miles turns to wrigley with a look of indignation
he gestures to their surroundings
sometimes i have serious doubts about you
i am very sorry
am i mentoring the wrong mentee
i could be mentoring kramer
kramer clerked for scalia
wrigley looks suicidal
couldnt you simply walk away from this abusive relationship
no he had the videos
anyway i need a challenge
this he waves dismissively at the courtroom
is not a challenge
i need something i can sink my teeth into professionally speaking
he would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in palm springs
he had a device he called the intruder
i ask again if you have any questions for the complainant
im sorry your honor i was just conferring with my associate
now then mrs
do you know a gentleman named morris rudnick
well yes morris is my accountant
he reaches back and wrigley puts a manila file in his hand
we would like to offer these photographs into evidence
the receptionist leans over her partition to chirp at marylin and her attorney ruth rabinow
ruth is a sturdy woman in her late s
guttman had gone to law school
massey will see you now
in the middle of the massy meyerson conference table is a large fruit and pastry plate
the door swings open
they shake hands
ruth rabinow this is rex rexroth
and you must be mrs
and you must be mr
they appraise each other for a beat
they are impressed and they are impressive
as they settle in sadly hello rex
are you alright
you lost weight
my whole metabolism is off
miles has been staring at marylin
she notices this and smiles shyly
he snaps out of it
sam is sam
hes taking up fly fishing
hes in a yert in montana
to rex ruth is a living legend rex
at a time when most women are in boca having early bird specials shes working so her husband can be in montana
in a yert
whats a yert
dryly i ran into your mother at the radiologist last week
oh just a routine mammogram
she said to say hello
shes going to positano with your brothers family
a tight terse smile from miles
positano is beautiful
remember when we were there rex
we stayed in the santo pietro
that hotel on the cliff
they drift for a moment
if you have a proposal lets hear it
at this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation
my client has ruled that out
my client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice
my client proposes a thirty day cooling off period
my client feels sufficiently dispassionate
my client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order
conceding the point heh heh
whats so goddamn funny
miles lays a hand on his arm
please let me handle this
he puts the clipboard away and looks carefully at ruth
so much for the icebreakers
whatre you after ruth
my client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets
why only fifty percent ruth
why not ask for a hundred percent
here we go
why not a hundred and fifty percent
maybe youre right miles
maybe were being too conservative
seventy five percent
rubs his stomach
marylin leans forward and whispers to him
do you need a tagamet
you have some
she removes a pack of the tablets from her purse along with several vials of prescription drugs
these are yours
not according to mrs
she hands the pills to a grateful rex
their hands touch for a moment
have you been taking your digestive enzymes
contrite sometimes i forget
she looks at him like a concerned parent
miles and ruth watch the interaction
to the attorneys im sorry
where were we
we were about to request the primary residence and thirty percent of the remaining assets
are you familiar with kirshner
kirshner does not apply
kirshner was in kentucky
please let me handle this
okay ruth forget kirshner whats your bottom line
the primary residence and forty percent of the remaining assets
youre becoming tedious miles
arent we going in the wrong direction
let me do my job
to ruth buy a clue ruthie
have you forgotten about kirshner
ruth stands and closes her attache case
see you at the preliminary
miles calls to ruths retreating back
well eat all the pastry
going through the door ruth doesnt react but marylin following glances back bemused but with a trace of a smile
rex swallows two more tablets
he sits looking despondent
i think that went as well as could be expected
she always looked out for me
and she had private investigators assisting her
sentimental she brought my digestive enzymes
in anticipation of making you sick
maybe i should reconsider my
miles looks at him
shakes his head sadly
a superficial display of marital solicitude and you lose your resolve
i underestimated you
but im your attorney and if you choose to reward her for that mediocre charade of spousal concern
he shrugs helplessly
a woman walking across a gymnasium floor
suddenly shes assaulted by a huge grotesquely garbed assailant
his sweats barely cover his massive overdeveloped musculature
on his head a ski mask stretches over a padded football helmet
he grabs the woman yanks her back towards him
she reacts swiftly
with a ferocious no she stomps on his foot and smashes him in the face
the mugger raises his hands in a gesture of submission
we pull back and see that we are in a self defense class
two instructors two muggers and ten women students all wearing t shirts with the words impact personal safety
marylin and sarah sit against the wall
i dont know what his game is
he dismissed every one of ruths proposals
and sarah we werent unreasonable
well what does he want
i dont know
ruth kept her cool but i could tell she was surprised
he has a reputation for being tough
marylin watches as a new victim begin her walk across the gym
grinning lillys up
the mugger emerges from his station and makes his way toward the victim
she glances over her shoulder and at the sight of the monster bearing down on her screams and runs to the exit
marylin and sarah giggle but reproachful looks from the other students force them to affect concerned looks
whispers every week im dying
the two instructors and the mugger try to coax the sobbing woman back into the room
they clasp her in an empathic group hug
anyway even rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence
if i didnt know better id swear massey had some personal investment in my ruination
so where are you now
well if he continues to maintain this position were in court
he called and invited me to dinner
the instructor a vivacious phys ed major approaches marylin
marylin gets up and coolly walks to center stage passing the traumatized lilly
thats completely odd
marylin begins the victim walk
the mugger quickly moves up from the rear
to sarah i know
thats why i accepted
find out whats up with this clown
the mugger is upon her
he grabs her hair
she stomps his foot and smoothly wheels around smashing him in the nose with her elbow while kneeing him in the groin
the women cheer
that was excellent marylin
but you forgot to yell no
calmly to the mugger no
miles rises from his seat as marylin enters
thank you for coming
the maitre d is pulling out a chair for her
i have to admit
i was curious
something to start
some wine perhaps
miles glances at the wine list
she smiles bordeaux
miles nods at the maitre d who returns the nod and withdraws
i assume this is on rex
miles regards her
your husband told me you were beautiful but i was unprepared
dismiss your vows your feigned tears your flattery for where a heart is hard they make no battery
miles leans back props his chin on one fist and considers her
do you have a hard heart marylin
did you see the tape
see the tape
then we can discuss my heart
a waiter appears and pour a taste of wine which miles sips and he nods at the waiter who pours two glasses
tell me mr
what was your performance about this afternoon
what does your lawyer think
ruth says youve been too successful that youre bored complacent and youre on your way down
but you dont agree
how do you know
why would you be here
i told you
i was hungry
flap a menu enters frame
it is handed to marylin another is handed to miles
ill have the tournedos of beef
and the lady will have the same
to marylin i assume youre a carnivore
i know you do
she addresses the waiter
risotto with white truffles please
miles looks at her with appreciation
who ever lovd that lovd not at first sight
you didnt ask me here to pick me up
you could get in trouble for that
youre not my client
freedom of association
big issue with the first amendment fans
want to go to hawaii for the weekend
have you ever been married miles
you dont believe in it
as a matter of fact im a huge fan
you just havent met the right person
she regards him for a moment
all right miles
let me tell you everything you think you know
i was married to rex for a long time
i was an excellent wife a partner a lover a hostess and a friend
there was only one thing i did wrong during the five years we were together
i got five years older
think he should be able to ditch me for that
he wants a reconciliation
see the tape
then we can discuss reconciliation
rex screwed up and i nailed his ass
now im going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it
then im getting on with my life
thats all im after
what is it youre after miles
oh im a lot like you just looking for an ass to mount
well dont look at mine
family court for the fifth district of los angeles county is now in session
a large black woman in judicial robes and raiment enters from behind the solomonic platform
the honorable marva munson presiding
massey wrigley and rex rexroth in between rise
rex and wrigley remain respectfully standing facing forward as they whisper out of the side of their mouths have you sat before her before
the judge sits
we argue before her
she sits before us
has she sat before you before
you cant sit before her
thats the rule
she sits before we argue
miles glances over and hisses shut
we are on a close lateral track of the jurors faces as they sit with earphones on in the darkened courtroom illuminated by a flickering tv monitor
leaking tinnily through the headsets we hear a very faint im gonna nail your ass
the track ends over at marylins table where marylin also wearing headphones looks on with studied stoicism
ruth lays a consoling hand on her shoulder
marylin rexroth now struggles to maintain her composure on the witness stand
she is modestly dressed and her attitude is one of shocked wounded innocence
i was devastated
thank you mrs
massey any questions
miles soberly rises
mmmm he paces hands clasped behind his back affecting to be lost in thought
marylin watches him
finally miles still pacing declaims dismiss your vows your feigned tears your flattery for where a heart is hard they make no battery
marylin looks up from her handkerchief with a look of startled irritation
miles stops pacing and turns to face her with a faint smile
do you know those lines mrs
marylin examines him with guarded eyes
ruth sensing something unscripted going on tries to cut it off
objection your honor
let me rephrase
rexroth how high is that wall around your heart
marylin eyes him suspiciously
your honor this is harassment
arid frankly its still a little
she flutters one hand
rexroth have you ever been in love
marylin hesitates gives a what does this mean look to ruth
she returns a beats me
i loved my husband rex
and youve always loved him
smiles slips out who ever lovd that lovd not at first sight
miles returns a fleeting smile
and you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him
why is that so difficult for you to understand
she looks at rex with tender sorrow
rex was is a very appealing man
i am sorry i couldnt
tearing up i tried my best
miles almost smiles
thatll be all mrs
please forgive me for causing you additional anguish
to the judge thank you your honor
no further questions
a bailiff offers to help marylin off the stand
she politely and courageously declines
whos next mrs
we rest your honor
yes your honor
i call patricia kennedy decordoba isenberg
patricia kennedy decordoba isenberg
marylin in the process of reseating herself behind her table pauses
ruth notices this and leans in
an attractive woman in her mid fifties advances to be sworn
she was a beauty but her glory days are past and shes not taking it well
she looks tense and slightly hypo manic
she speaks in a breathy giggly voice and smiles frequently for no apparent reason
banderas do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give shall be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god
what is your relationship to mrs
we dont have much of a relationship anymore
i havent seen her since before she married rex
we had some very nice times prior to that
we were quite close
to marylin is this a lover
and how would you define your relationship to mrs
you know you are her
patricia smiles coyly
gives marylin a silly little wave by way of greeting
hard to believe i know
im sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters
mumbles hell regret this
have you ever met mr
but ive been out of town
little girlish wave hello rex
you were never invited to meet your son in law
i dont think so
objection your honor
this isnt about mrs
rexroths filial obligations
did you know mrs
rexroth was married
of course she was married
what else would she be
i dont think so
she laughs merrily at some private joke between her and her psyche
let me tell you something about patty
thats her name
i was pat and she was patty
but she changed it after seeing some like it hot
after marylin monroe
and what were you going to tell us about patty slash marylin
when she was a tiny girl
and people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up
she never said the usual things little girls say like nurse ballerina anchorwoman
she always said very shirley temple when i grow up i want to be divorced
she laughs happily at the memory
divorce was her childhood aspiration
well not just divorce
she used to say i want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy
and i guess her dream is coming true
to marylin im happy for you patty pasta being cooked
salad being tossed
wine glasses are filled
its girls night at the beach
it was like that scene in the godfather
frankie pentangeli is called to testify against the family
and hes in court and he looks into the spectators gallery and sees his brother
they brought the brother from sicily
and frankie cant say a word
he cant testify
thats what it was like seeing pat in there
i couldnt even have ruth cross examine her
why do you think she did it
shrugs maybe she wanted a free trip to la
maybe they offered her money
massey is very seductive
maybe they put a horse head in her bed
they left you with absolutely nothing
it makes you wonder about the entire legal system
like rodney king
they bought her speech
if i was only in it for rexs money he shouldnt have to give me any
that doesnt make sense
its like punishing you for being goal oriented
well you can live here as long as you want
do you have any plans
nothing specific but ill have my own place soon
is that what you said when you were a little girl
every woman in my life was divorced at least twice
what was i supposed to say
i begged you to have a baby
in the godfather after the courtroom scene frankie pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub
ill see some blood before this is over but it wont be mine
miles is at his weekly chess game with his college friend dr
kenneth beck a disaffected plastic surgeon
miles cohiba in hand studies the board
ken sips his merlot
moves a piece
she got absolutely nothing
i wont be seeing her
your clients usually visit me after the settlement
not this one
not unless her hmo covers plastic surgery which incidentally she does not need
everyone needs plastic surgery
you need it
i dont need it
you want botox
what the hell is botox
its a form of botulism
i just inject it into your forehead and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you cant raise them
why in gods name would i want
no frown lines
notices miles watch new watch
its a lecoultre revers
you can flip the face and set it for two time zones
why would you need two time zones
you never leave beverly hills
it was a gift from a client
set one side for bel air
we had aspirations when we were in college
we did not
you were going to be a cardiac surgeon
i was going to clerk for the supreme court
i was going to play golf
you were going to have asian girlfriends
denial is not a river in egypt
kenneth moves a chess piece
youre in check
i should be in therapy
miles addresses bonnie donovan a client
your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures
and yes absent a swimming pool the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious
but bonnie who is the real victim here
let me suggest the following
your husband who on a prior occasion slapped you beat you reacts well i wouldnt say your husband who has beaten you repeatedly he please was at the time brandishing
your firearm trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance friend of long standing they hate each other so he says now
but if not for your cool headed intervention his tantrum might have ended this schmoes life and ruined his own
as for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined had taken place wasnt it in fact he who had been sleeping with the pool man
he stares contemplatively at the ceiling and after a beat responds to the silence am i going to far here
a squawk box interrupts with a female voice
meyerson would like to see you when you have a moment
miles is surprised
herb wants to see me
when you have a moment
slatted shades are drawn against the sun
it is dim gloomy
we can just make out the shape of an ancient man small hunched seated behind an enormous desk
a gallows shape next to him is hard to make out it is tall rail thin and fixed with a swinging glinting appendage
a voice old dry rasping lightly accented of a long gone brooklyn boyhood seems disembodied and sourceless as if it is the voice of the gloom itself
thoity six objections sustained tree overruled fawteen summary judgements sought toiteen ranite eighteen movments to voice fuh respondents prejudice eighteen ranite which is a hunnut pissent an arm is being
extended toward us and the glinting appendage swings with it we see that it is an iv which snakes down and into the hunched mans suit sleeve
twelve cawt days on the rexrawt case alone tree hunutn twenty billable hours paralegal soivicies four hunnutn two billable associate counsel and consultative six hunnutn eighty billable at full attorney
rate and eightyfive lunches charged
miles takes the mans offered hand withered and roped with veins and accepts its clammy shake
counseluh you are the engine that drives this foim he leans back in his chair breathing heavily and runs a tongue over his sandpapery lips
he is wearing oversize swifty lazar style glasses heavily tinted in spite of the dark
at length thank you herb
miles sits behind his desk fingers steepled staring at nothing a haunted look on his face
his intercom squawks mr
im feeling very fragile
im sorry mr
massey but i felt certain youd want to know marylin rexroth wants to see you
when does she shes here now
miles runs his fingers through his hair carefully examining himself in the mirror
he clears his throat begins again with lower pitch suave smile still in place marylin
how lovely uh he runs a finger across his teeth which squeak then puts back the suave smile marylin
what a pleasure on miles as he opens the door suavely smiling
marylin what a pleas who the fuck are you
facing him in the doorway is a large roughly handsome middle aged man in a business suit
just behind him is marylin rexroth looking as coolly beautiful as ever
she smoothly puts in miles how nice of you to see us may i introduce howard d
doyle of doyle oil
i told you we know each other baby
massey represented my ex brother in law
wont you have a seat
to marylin after you doll
marylin glides into the office
seats herself on the couch
doyle sits next to her one proprietary hand on her knee
and how is mrs
few suicide attempts little inpatient stint
naturally she misses her kids
six weekends a year and alternate yom kippurs seemed harsh to us but hey alls fair
anyhoo she lives with a nurse takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop
so shes uh flourishing
she makes felt wallets
got one right here
doyle pulls out a deranged piece of felt stuffed with money
most of the contents slip to the floor
leather would be more practical but whatcha gonna do
miles i know youre busy and that you charge by the hour so ill come to the point
howard and i are planning to marry
miles is stunned
muh well uh huh
my divorce just came through
shoulda called you
coulda cut a better deal
my wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children
but i dont know
guess im just a softie
after all amanda and me were together for what youd know better than me marylin
she was your best friend
thinks sixteen years
is fourteen and mandy must be what twelve
to miles here
he removes a family photo from the felt wallet
its of howard and two fat teenagers
apparently the former mrs
doyle was cut out but an ear and part of a hairdo are sill visible in the shot
uh guess congratulations are in order
well marylin and rex broke up and
honey i dont think this is really relevant to
and one day this sweet girl calls me asks me to lunch
just a shoulder to cry on deal
one thing leads to another and before i know it we realized wed always been very attracted to one another
i had no idea until after but he looks at her with predatory lust
you are so hot
he pulls her close to him and plants a massive kiss on her
what a touching story
you know miles after my wife wifes mastectomy things were never the same
this might sound cold well maybe not to you massey but
man to man i like my women with two boobs
miles flashes marylin a you are kidding look but she assiduously avoids eye contact
howard and i are here miles because i have learned through bitter experience that when it comes to matrimonial law you are the very best
miles acknowledges this with a curt nod
as you are well aware my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation my motives were questioned
i was slandered in court
you did good massey
therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet howard i wish to execute a pre nuptial agreement
and theres no talking her out of it
believe me ive tried
they say the massey pre nup has never been penetrated
she said penetrate
heh heh heh
he gropes her
she giggles like a teenager
oh for the love of
that is true isnt it miles
your pre nup is the best there is
that is correct
not to blow my own horn but they devote an entire semester to it at harvard law
i just want to make sure that you both he eyes marylin
understand what youre asking for here
the massey pre nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in and earned
no one can profit from the marriage
the pre nup protects the wealthier party
well at the moment thatd be me
and without it that party is exposed a sitting duck
no wriggle room
a wriggle room
maybe we should put that in the malibu house
screw the screening room
slightly sickened and we are sure
eyes boring into marylin
we are both sure thats what we want
course i cant do much wriggling if you tie me up like that again
massey this is one bad bad little girl
laughing wed better go before we get thrown out
marylin and howard wait for an elevator as miles trots out to catch them
excuse me mr
doyle if i could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment
id just like to have a word with her
im going to have her for a lifetime
miles drags her to the side as doyle checks his sports pager
what are you doing
she backs up as he tries to close the space between them
hes a sick freak
hes a pervert
he should have to register when he moves
all girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time
listen to me
you listen to me
very quiet and deliberate you busted me miles
you left me with nothing
what did you expect me to do
get a degree in counseling
write a book about table linen
because thats what wives do when they get dumped and frankly im not quite ready for that
but why him
we told you
we realized weve always been in love
he has backed her against the wall of an alcove which shelters a flowering ficus
the massey pre nup has never been pene successfully challenged
so i hear
is that all
no thats not all
he moves to kiss her
you fascinate me
she deftly slides out of the way
miles watches her as she heads down the hall
as she gets on the elevator howard grabs her butt with one hand while giving miles a high sign with the other
miles stares at the chessboard
do you think im going to end up like herb myerson with a colostomy bag instead of a family
got any symptoms
the inability to experience pleasure
beat dont waste time with your queen
the center counter defense
the thing is not to move your queen too early
she cant really love that idiot can she
she came into my office and signed a pre nup with howard doyle
miles nods a massey pre nup
miles nods again she loves him
hes the wrong man
dont waste time with someone elses queen either
from behind the bower rabbi bolensky emerges strumming his guitar and singing parsley sage rosemary and thyme remember me to one who lives there
a pullback reveals howard d
doyle before the altar with marylin
he is in a tuxedo and yarmulke
she is dressed in a simple kennedy type gown
she once was a true love of mine
the last arpeggiated chord rings out birds tweet everyone sits
as miles and wrigley seat themselves wrigley is sniffling
miles is irritated
what the hell is wrong with you
i cant help it
even with the business were in i it gets me every time
its so optimistic
is she going through with it
as the crowd quiets with the end of the song wrigley murmurs if shes not going through with it shes cutting it awful close
parsley sage rosemary and thyme
spicy ingredients for the banquet we call life
marriage is like a great feast
courtship is the appetizer
a small mixed green taste of things to come
the early years the first course a carefully poached fish dish dependent on freshness and delicate handling
or perhaps a light pasta a tortellini stuffed with cheese and hope
whispers to miles you have any gum or mints
the main course mature love a hearty stew cooked slowly in the oven of companionship until the meat falls off the bone
and then dessert
the reward for years spent together the sweetness of a life well lived
a sorbet of grandchildren followed by the decafe demitasse of retirement
there is silence broken only by the twitter of birds and the restlessness of a hungry audience
finally do you chaim david doyle take marylin to be the barbara to your wolfgang though the lean years as well as those that are heavily marbled
and do you marylin rexroth take chaim to be the roux in your bechamel
the stock in your sauce
miles bites a knuckle
then by the power vested in me by the state of california and as the maitred in the prix fixe four star restaurant of life i now pronounce you man
rabbi bolensky strolls through the crowd with a heaping platter of smoked salmon
miles is darkly brooding as wrigley opens a tiffany box to show him the contents
what do you think
what are they
honestly wrigley im surprised at you
what is this
some martha stewart suggestion
those are the most cockamamie things ive ever miles why so angry
miles sounds wistful why couldnt we be the club sandwich
ding ding howard d
is tapping a knife against his wine glass
the crowd quiets
ladies and gentlemen boys and girls i have something to say to my bride
turns to one side to address marylin taking one of her hands between his paws as she beams up at him
darling like the rabbi said
life is a banquet a grand bouffe and marylin darling
i just want you to know that i am in the kitchen and i can stand the heat
laughter from the gallery
and im going to start this marriage by eating my words
because the hot hors doerve of this love story is pre nup primavera
he reaches into his breast pocket and withdraws a piece of paper
bring on the pesto
a caterer places a plate and a bowl of sauce in front of doyle
marylin looks on surprised and bemused
this is for you darling
he starts tearing strips off the piece of paper dipping them into the sauce and eating them
his mouth stuffed with paper doyle repeats this is for you darling
the crowd is murmuring the murmurs grow in volume a smattering of applause cheers more applause wild cheers
slowly rhythmically miles starts thumping his hand together nodding comprehension
next to him wrigley is puzzled
why is he doing that
miles hand clapping accelerates
hes eating the pre nup
wrigleys eyes widen
he looks back at doyle eating the paper
this is for you darling
wrigley bursts into tears
thats the most romantic thing ive ever seen in my life
marylin stands at the punch bowl accepting congratulations
miles approaches and draws her aside
id like to offer my congratulations
that was a beautiful gesture of howards
howard is a beautiful person
hes a diamond in the rough
and i have a feeling that someday soon youll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough
i am thrilled for you but tell me this
howd you get howard to do it
ive addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea
it was his idea
it was a gesture of love and trust
be happy for me miles
well when this goes south promise youll have dinner with me
she holds a plate of food for him have you tried the duck
i figure a couple of months
thats how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry
he takes the plate of food from her
it has bones
be sure to swallow one
although knowing you as i do there will be no settlement
this time it will be complete and total annihilation
with a roar we cut to a uniformed pilot and copilot are cruising the corporate jet high above a vast ocean of clouds
the pilot is wearing a headset
after a long moment of listening he shakes his head
ive heard some ive heard some sick things in my what
the pilot reaches above his head and throws a small toggle switch and the cockpit is awash with the sound of screaming laughter and music oh casey jones was the
rounders name twas on the that he rode to fame
screaming with laughter two naked damsels in conductors caps are pushing rex rexroth around the cabin on a miniature locomotive
he is wearing his railroad boxers and bellowing the ballad of casey jones
who is that guy
rex rexroth the mini mall king
getting to be the richest man on the west coast from what they say
the copilot shakes his head
come all you rounders if you wanna hear
whyre they going to muncie
the pilot shrugs
hes thinking of buying indiana
whooosh the plane roars away
and of course we shall have to litigate
a secretary seated by his desk is taking notes
naturally the first concern for both parties is the welfare of little wendell junior
nevertheless we question whether the continuing expenses for his special ed classes are truly justified given the great strides wrigley enters
im sorry im late
i was having lunch with ruth rabinows assistant
marylin rexroth is divorced
delighted and i hear shes richer than croesus
ah but is she richer than mrs
she could buy and sell you ten times over
she deserves every penny
they pay great athletes a fortune
well marylin rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power
he hits the call button
get me marylin rexroth doyle
she owes me a meal
id stay away from her miles
i know you would wrigley
but would kramer
we hear the receptionist voice mrs
doyle for you
we move in on one of the tables where marylin and miles sit as a waiter pours them champagne
le veuve clicquot ponsardin
ill take care of it
as he fill marylins glass raises his own in a toast
i dont feel victorious miles
i feel betrayed abandoned and humiliated
i have pictures of him with another woman
my god marylin
you can open an erotic art gallery
did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs
just to comfort you and appreciate you reproachfully you really think i engineered the whole thing
you think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme
you came here to celebrate because you think im without morality or soul
you with difficulty sound like my mother
the waiter hands miles a menu
should we order
yes i well im not really
not hungry huh
neither am i
a long pensive moment
miles reaches across the table and takes her hand
she lets him
he strokes it
marylin sits silently looking out the window
miles pulls up to the huge house
and good night
he takes her hand again
marylin she puts a finger to his lips
sadly miles relinquishes her hand
she exits the car and walks up to the front door
miles watches her go
we hear court tv on in the background
miles alone in bed reading art in america
a witness is being examined by the prosecutor and he asked you if
if i reckon i could find someone to keel him his wife
who asked you this
points to the defendant that guy
in a boiling night sky
there are distant echoing wails
along a pointing suitcoated arm
eighteen hunnut billable hours
twelve hunnutn twenty one motions tuh void
the woozy track finds the cadaverous hand at the end of the arm with an iv tube swinging from it
miles stands next to the arm
hes holding an assault type weapon
five nunnutn sixty faw summary judgenents
a hunnutn twenty nine thousand four hunnutn seventeen lunches charged
miles shoots bonnie falls
marylin is next
miles points the gun at herb
he bolts up in bed sweating
he gazes stuporously about reaching for the ringing phone
youre right about me
i am worthless
i am nothing
i dont deserve to live
when did i say
i dont blame them for betraying me
i dont blame rex or howard or my father
you see miles im going to tell you something about me
something you may or may not know
we hear the screech of tires
yelling at someone screw you asswipe
forgive me but are you drunk
scream you get out of the car
thats right fuctard
im talkin to you
you shouldnt be driving
where are you
im on sunset
near the beverly hills hotel
wanna meet me for a drink in the polo
i live right near there
the block of maple
marylin come here right now before just come here
should i stop at starbucks and pick up a blended for no
marylin sits in the den
shes had some coffee and although teary and disheveled is no longer psychotic
i just cried when i got home
somehow your disdain for me im pretty tough miles but im human
all my life people have been ascribing these terrible motives to me
i used to think they were jealous or they didnt understand but
maybe others see something in me
something im not even aware of
anyway thank you for letting me come here
i guess i was a little drunk
she takes the coffee cup and has a sip
she looks like a lost waif
you have a very nice home miles
you have wonderful art
i love that lithograph
i just got that actually
it was a gift
from a girlfriend
i dont have a
it was from a client
ill bet you have some very grateful clients
whatd rex buy you
rex sent me two humidors full of pre castro cubans
marylin looks at a photograph miles has on a side table
the woman has her arm around one of them
the other stands close to her
smiling but awkward and tentative
is that you
and that is mom
mom and brother
you look like you were a very sensitive child
you have expressive eyes
miles walks over to look at the picture
and your mother was very beautiful
she must be proud of you
she never particularly cared for me
she didnt love you
she loved me
she would never not love her son
she just didnt
i wasnt her type
she said i was a very colicky baby
not a good sleeper
didnt eat well
we got off to a bad start and she never seemed to recoup she held that against you
apparently she was very disappointed
boy oh boy
marylin looks at the picture again
and yes you can see how hesitant miles was
marylin is moved
a flash of something genuine crosses her face
and here i thought my mother was
your mother was
you met patricia
she takes a sip of coffee
were damaged goods
no were not
we are miles
you know im right
theres something off about you and me miles
and maybe it isnt because of these women maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our deficiencies very early on
that is bullshit
mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho
i cant believe youre saying this marylin
theres nothing wrong with us
were attractive and charismatic and successful and
i like us
im sorry miles
you shouldnt listen to me
im sure you have a very fulfilling life
id better go
thank you for the coffee
its very robust
picks up her purse
walks over to him with an outstretched hand
stay with me for a while
he doesnt release her hand
instead he draws her to him and kisses her
she kisses him
he kisses her back
mile and marylin making love
they are in post coital wrap
i have to say im speechless
im never speechless
im a little embarrassed
im not used to losing control with such volume
and im not used to marylin theres something i want to ask you
what is it miles
i want to
she waits puzzled
i want to be your your wife
that wasnt right
i want you to be my wife
did you just propose to me
what else could those words mean
i believe we belong together and we can make one another happy
and we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is just jump in any old time marylin
you have more experience at this than i do
yes you do have more experience
do you want me to sleep on it
do you want to sleep on it
i have been asleep all my life up to this moment
marylin will you marry me
i dont have a ring
i have a watch
miles and kenneth wait
dressed in suits
miles looks nervous
im happy for you pal
is she asian
wrigley rushes in carrying a briefcase
kenneth this is my associate wrigley
wrigley this is my friend dr
the plastic surgeon
i read about you in la style
do you have it
i have it
you have the pre nup
i have the ring
was i supposed to have a pre nup
you have the ring
wrigley has the pre nup
i thought maybe he sees someone gee
she looks outstanding
her friends sarah sorkin and ramona barcelona who is now visibly pregnant accompany her
how are you
you know each other
of course you do
i have an appointment to see you in march
right after i lose the babyweight
which of course will be after i have the baby
ramona barcelona this is miles massey
to marylin marylin
you know my young associate wrigley
he was at my divorce and my wedding
what would a marital related event be without wrigley
it has become a tradition hasnt it
i loved the berry spoons
wrigley beams i didnt have any
well wrigley brought something else for you today darling
wrigley pulls a sheaf of papers from the briefcase
this is the massey pre nup
wrigley hastily pulls a ballpoint from his pocket and clicks it
miles grabs the pre nup and as he turns to marylin his tone softens
marylin youre welcome to examine it but as you know its iron clad
i tried to reach ruth but we couldnt get her
we wanted ruth here for your protection as well the judge is here
over here judge munson
wasnt she the judge at my divorce hearing
short notice you know but i think theres nice closure to it
hello judge muson
a pleasure as always
whats up with you two
were getting married
whats the gag
marylin looks at the pre nup
then pulls miles aside
excuse me judge muson
you got it patty
to miles you brought a pre nup to our wedding
she isnt having the expected reaction its for your protection sweetheart
youre the one with the the
i dont want to sign this
i want this marriage to be different
judge munsen and wrigley are here but other than that
should i go out for a smoke
judge just a sec
but marylin if we sign it i cant hope to benefit from the marriage
sadly oh miles
what i mean is your wealth is completely protected
as if a lead veil had been drawn across
she looks deep into his eyes
into his soul
listen to me
you are about to become my husband
i dont want to be protected from you
i want to be protected for you
i want this to be a marriage based on love trust and community property
thats all ive ever wanted
but marylin without this youre completely exposed
i want to be exposed
its about time
youre a sitting duck
to miles with great affection quack
miles and marylin stand before the alter
do you miles herbert massey of massey meyerson take marylin hamilton rexroth doyle
doyle to be your lawful wedded wife to i do yah i do uh huh let me finish
she glares at miles
havent you ever been married before
chastened miles bows his head
to have and hold to love and to cherish till death do you part
there is a long beat through which miles stares at his shoes
marylin looks at him
and do you marylin hamilton rexroth doyle take miles herbert massey of massey meyerson to be your lawful wedded husband to have and to hold to love and to cherish
till death do you part
i now pronounce you man and wife
wrigley bursts into tears
miles and marylin asleep in bed
the alarm rings
miles wakes turns to his beautiful wife kisses her good morning
she gives him a sleepy smile
miles dressing for work
marylin in a sabia rosa bathrobe places a tray with coffee next to him
he holds up two ties for her approval
she selects one
he puts it on
miles and marylin reading newspapers while eating breakfast
she serves him a bowl of fruit and indicates wrigleys berry spoons
they laugh heartily
marylin waves good bye as miles backs drives to the office
she waves at the gardeners who blow palm fronds around the lawn
he has managed to fill his credenza with pictures of married life
due to its brevity these pictures are uneventful the masseys wear the same outfit in most of them
he is interrupted by the voice of his secretary
i have mrs
massey on line one for you
miles picks up
he laughs and laughs
we hear marylins laughter coming through the receiver
miles exits a flower store with a bouquet of tulips
marylin at the doorway greets miles as he arrives home
as miles changes into his casual after work outfit khakis
marylin sits at the edge of the bed
hes telling her about his day and she is rapt with attention
the masseys have a candlelit dinner of fish and pasta
the tulips are in the middle of the table
miles and marylin snuggle on a couch and watch seinfeld
miles in bed on the new frette linen
a few too many pillows but hes making it work
marylin enters the bedroom in a nightshirt that is the perfect combination of innocence and nastiness
he puts down his book as she gets into bed with him
they gaze at one another the picture of contentment and impending lust
miles is addressing the young associates
for the first time in my life i stand before you naked
and in love
a word matrimonial lawyers shy away from
ironic isnt it that i have been frightened of this emotion which is in a sense the seed of my livelihood
but today i am here to tell you love should cause us no fear
love should cause us no shame
he lets it sink in let me ask you a question
when our clients come to us confused angry hurting because their flame of love is fluttering and threatens to die should we seek to extinguish that flame so that we
can sift through the smoldering wreckage for our paltry reward
or should we seek to fan this precious flame this most precious flame back to loving roaring life
the young associates look confused
wrigley raises his hand
should we counsel fear or trust
should we seek to destroy or to build
should we meet our clients problems with cynicism or with love
another raised hand kramer
the decision of course is each of ours
for my part i have made the leap of love and there is no going back herb myserson sits in the back of the room
he watches breathing heavily
miles and marylin watching a cable movie crowded together on the small sofa
im squishing you
ill move to the
i want you close to me
this couch is wrong
its not a married couch
he surveys his surroundings with a critical eye
honey i could sit
in fact this is not a married house its a bachelor pad
you have six bedrooms i know
but ive converted most of them into ridiculous guy rooms a billiard room a card room a gym honey want you to go out as soon as you feel up
to it and buy married things
make this your house
he hands her a credit card
heres my card
spend as much as you want
we get mileage
well i suppose i could girly it up for you with a little fortuny and some passementerie good
beat are those foods
fabric and fringe
and then maybe not right away theres a room right off the bedroom it would be perfect for a nursery
he takes her hands its a walk in humidor right now but if i took out the refrigeration unit miles
i think a nursery should be right off the master suite
my parents put mine in the guest house
apparently they did have a fisher price intercom but my mother turned it off when i was seven months old because i was so she stops him with a kiss
you want children dont you
a pricey antique store near melrose
you said yes didnt you
i said yes
she picks up an antique chinese bowl
is this ming
its not ming
is tong older than ming
i think ming is older than tong
to the salesman hovering nearby what is this
that is a chinese prayer bowl
its chen dynasty
ill take it
he sets it aside next to the formidable pile of loot the girls have accumulated
i cant do this anymore
lets get some lunch
what about rugs
i thought we were stopping at mansour
to marylin and will this be check or
she hands him the platinum visa
glances at it very good mrs
he trots off with the card
marylin absently fingers an antique guided candelabra
he said to make the house mine
if he only knew
you know what
hes not what i expected
hes very hes so happy
but youre going through with it
yes yes its just you know ive never been the first wife
rex was married before me
miles is different
hes still so idealistic
well thats about to change big time
he has no cynicism or anger
for once im not the repository of rage at some other woman
soon youll have your own rage
miles is buying a huge bouquet of flowers
as he exits he is stopped by a woman
she is in her s but looks older
i know you
youre miles massey
you probably dont recognize me
the drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair
you ruined my life you sonofabitch
she grabs the flowers
pulls petal off one of the roses and eats it
but my brother got you
he got you you slimeball
a nurse runs over
what are you
to the nurse is she yours
howard doyle is my brother
you know my brother howard doyle
you do know my brother dont you
im sorry sir
give the man back
yes i know howard doyle
he tricked you
with a phony wife and a fake pre nup
he got you
you married marylin didnt you
you thought she had money
ha ha ha
howard doyle made you think that because of what you did to me
and to marylin rexroth
i heard all about it
my brother howard doyle got you
singsong neener neener neener
ruth calmly watches miles ranting around her office
he divorced his wife he married marylin he divorced marylin and he remarried his wife
what kind of sick marylin was friends with howard and amanda doyle
they dont like the way you operate
they helped her
he never ate the pre nup did he
i have no idea what howard doyle eats
im not a damn dietician
did marylin end up with money
shes your wife
why dont you ask her
anyway i assume she signed the highly over rated massey pre nup
i dont have a pre nup miles hangs his head
ruth sighs sympathetically
the fault dear brutus is not in our stars
dont give me that crap
thats my crap
and its good
ill have you suspended
ill have you disbarred
dont threaten me miles
i did nothing illegal
why did she do it ruth
thats attorney client privilege
as she goes back into her work sorry miles
but as a great and clever man once said whats good for the goose marylin greets him at the door
i have a surprise for you
she brings him inside
the place has been massively accessorized
antiques rugs lamps and assorted tasteful chatchkies
there is a new biedermeyer couch in the den
miles looks at it expressionless
you dont like it
he stares at her a very dark look
you dont like me
flatly i love you
i want to have your baby
whats wrong miles
did i spend too much
she retrieves all the receipts from her purse
i have a very good relationship with all the salesmen
i can return everything
can you marylin
can you return the trust
can you return the hopes
can you just
youre scaring me
pulls himself together im sorry darling
i love it
its chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and
its you marylin
it is you
marylin is on the phone with ruth
but ruth things have changed yes yes i understand
but you see i couldnt file did i
and maybe i wasnt going to file
maybe maybe ruth yes
the bedroom door is closed
marylin knocks repeatedly
open the door miles
please open the door
i want to talk to you
im coming in
here i come
she pushes the door open
no miles in sight
on the bed scrawled on a piece of mmm stationery taped to one of the mmm frette pillows a note which reads if you prick us do we not bleed
if you tickle us do we not laugh
if you poison us do we not die
and if you wrong us shall we kenneth stares at the chessboard
court tv is on the background
we are back at the trial of new jersey v
medrano is accused of killing his wife alicia in
he claims it was suicide
lets return to the courtroom
see the action in the courtroom the prosecutor shows the jury an extremely large handgun
how far would this gun have to be in order to inflict a wound without leaving powder burns on the scalp
approximately three feet
and how could mrs
medrano shoot herself in the back of the head from a distance of three feet
really long arms
he moves a piece
they wont get a conviction
the husband called it in as a suicide
the forensic guys werent thinking murder
im sure some of the evidence was compromised
its your move miles
sadly i already made my move kenneth
a private yoga class
marylin sarah and ramona are in the plow position
the yuppie sikh instructor places his weight on sarah
knock it off
breathe through it
sarah tries a few deep breaths
marylin concentrates hard
thats good marylin
i dont even know where he is
he looked so devastated
if i could just talk to him for a few minutes
was that the bell
it sounded like a bell
ill be right back
marylin walks to the door
two police officers
can i help you
marylin hamilton rexroth doyle massey
we have a warrant for your arrest
marylin is photographed front and profile
she is finger printed she is searched and relieved of her jewelry and finally she is throw into a holding tank with several other women trapped
she clings despondently to the bars
ruth is admitted to the holding area
a police officer walks down the hall
unlocks the door
you can go now mrs
someone made bail
marylin sits next to ruth
forgery and fraud
you used his credit card
he told me to he said he wanted me to quite a little shopping spree
how do you spend six figures in less than six hours
oh never mind ive seen it before
ive seen everything
do you think he set me up
do you think that was his intention
like i know his intention
or yours for that matter
sighs i should join sam
im too old for this bullshit
he never even asked
he just assumed he was right wasnt he
well marylin now you cut a deal or find out how jean harris made it work for her
miles opens the door
marylin is standing there
look who made bail
may i come in
i dont know
maybe i should grab my mace
im a civil attorney
i have little experience with the criminal mind
id just like to pick up a few of my things i dont believe you have things
on the contrary
were married and we have no pre nup so a case could be made that everything in here is mine
marylin walks into the den
sits on the new sofa
what do you want
i want to nail you ass
are you threatening me because im sure thats a violation of the terms of your bail
im reporting you to the irs
they owe me
im expecting a refund
she looks at him dead serious
im clean with the irs
ive reported every dollar ive ever made
try again girlfriend
im not talking about dollars studmuffin
im talking about she opens a humidor and takes out a cigar
chomping on the cigar got a light
what kind of stuff
she reaches into her purse
pulls out a dunhill and expertly lights the cigar
arty farty stuff
pointing to the hockney lithographs and pre castro cubans
watches and mileage on private jets
stuff you get from grateful clients
those are gifts
glancing at his watch by the way what time is it on bellagio road
you cant prove anything
i dont have to
thats what the irs guys do
and they do it with great zeal
see they work at these tortuous civil service jobs and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies these saps feel
well they feel like saps
and they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel wrath
puffing on the cigar what is this
a romeo and julieta
youre out of your league marylin
rexroth was a primate
im a professional
so am i right
and so is agent wilson of the internal revenue service
hes a dedicated underpaid graduate of southwestern university very tenacious and never more so than when hes dealing with an unscrupulous colleague
she stands to leave i think its only fair to warn you im going to file an action miles
and after a decent interval i plan to have ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within feet of my house
meaning my house
i believe the residence will be part of the settlement
did our marriage ever mean anything to you
drop the bogus forgery charge and ill forget about your generous friends slash clients
she gives him a peck on the cheek
as she leaves youll always be my favorite husband
miles sits dejectedly on the new sofa looking at the paintings
he looks at the watch
and the cigars
and the picture of his mother
pity you cant be here
youd enjoy this
we pull back from the milky yellowish bag of fluid to show that a nurse is unhooking and removing it from under herb meyersons wheelchair where it collects drainage
she now places it up on the iv gantry and connects and swaps the now empty drip under the wheelchair to collect drainage
we are once again in herb meyersons gloomy office its venetians blocking most of the light and making herb a dark enigmatic figure
this woman has humbled shamed and disgrazed the entire foim
a reverse shows miles standing in front of herbs desk
yes herb counseluh this foim deals in powuh

miles is in bed morosely watching court tv
close on nikki rosen a court tv anchor we are interrupting our scheduled weekend coverage because we have just received word there is a verdict in the kentucky v leonard
we now join the case live
reads of the charges of murder in the first degree we the jury find the defendant not guilty
nikki speaks to her guest host
he got away with it
simpson started a trend
an edgy looking gangster joe
he is perspiring heavily
he breathes through his mouth with the rasping wheeze of an asthmatic
his labored breath rattles as he stares across the table at someone off
at length a voice are you joe
still staring but perhaps by way of answer the gangster raises an inhaler sticks it in his mouth and squeezes
a reverse shows miles seated across a small round table in a seedy low lit clam house
photos of ted kennedy and the pope adorn the walls
i am here representing mr
dumbarton on a
matter of some delicacy
whos the pigeon
who do you want me to kill
well i uh that is to say mr
dumbarton would like you to uh neutralize a uh business associate by the name of marylin rexroth doyle massey uh dumbart uh massey
heres her picture
he is shoving an envelope across the table
and the address where shes staying
its the residence of a mr
uh its not mr
though hes not involved
and because of an impending legal action this needs to happen within a certain
on an expedited basis
the gangster stares expressionlessly
he raises the inhaler again and with his eyes still on miles squeezes
youre in a rush
dumbarton is yes
a long beat
finally miles explodes she wont suffer will she
he bites a knuckle gazing fearfully at the gangster
the gangster stares impassively back
not unless you pay extra
an enormous oak paneled room
furnished with chairs sofas and a huge circular bed
a fire roars in the far corner
on the wall above the bed a film loop is being projected soft core pornographic images
on the bed rex is surrounded by three naked beauties smeared in cola dust and wearing conductor caps
ive been working on the railroad all the livelong day
ive been working on the railroad just to pass the time away
cantcha hear the whistle
rex hunches over clutching his left arm
one by one the girls stop dancing and stare
there is a somber silence broken by another
awwwwwww the girls are all watching now
one of them steps forward
whatsa matter rexie
a guest room
dark dirty and filled with empty bottles of expensive french wine
we hear a phone ringing in a different room
it rings several times
the figure on the bed stirs rolls over moans clamps a pillow over his head
the ring of the distant telephone is interrupted and we hear a muffled voice hello
yes hes here
just a minute we hear approaching footsteps and kenneth enters the background knotting a bathrobe
he turns on the light in the room
its for you
the figure on the couch pulls away the pillow
it is indeed miles massey
he blearily takes the offered phone
yes i see after another listening beat he drops the phone away
he remains staring dully out into space
that was marvin untermeyer
he was rex rexroths personal attorney
what do you mean was
rex just had a massive coronary
in the middle of a business meeting
kenneth is mildly puzzled
im sorry to hear that
but you werent close were you
marvin says that rexs will is four years old
he never redrafted it
miles voice is still flat expressionless everything goes to marylin
he looks up a at kenneth
were still married
we have no pre nup
so thats good right
miles paces with the telephone
he punches numbers with the thumb of the hand holding the phone his other hand holds a coffee cup from which he takes trembling slurps
this is joe
then a beep
this is mr
friend of we met
this is to instruct you its no go
do you understand me
no go on marylin rexroth doyle no go
he slams down the phone
who was that
that was oh shit
what if hes on his way over there
consumed with remorse miles moans
what have i done
i dont know but dont call me marylin
miles drives speeding taking corners hard while punching numbers into his car phone
get her out buy some time get her out in the bedroom the phone starts ringing
a hand enters to pick it up
we follow the hand up to reveal hello
where have you been
ive been trying to get in touch
you have to leave the house immediately
i will miles
i will leave
but miles no buts
just listen to me
im sorry miles
its true that my initial intention was to
leave the house
i fell in love miles
so did i
now pack up a few basics and you do
you do love me
marylin hangs up the phone
she walks slowly around the room pausing at the mantelpiece to pick up a framed picture of miles which she contemplatively regards
we pan with her continued walk to bring joe into frame
he stands with his back pressed to the wall
shes started for a moment but quickly recoups whoever sent you ill pay double
she shows him the picture of miles
is this mr
she cocks an eye at him
thats his lawyer
whos the pigeon
we faintly hear a car screeching to a halt
massey exits the car
he clutches a can of mace
we hear a key scrape in the lock
the front door swings open onto a dark foyer as miles tiptoes in
miles tiptoes through looking warily about
he backs through the swinging doors connecting to the kitchen
finds himself face to face with joe
thank god youre in time
youre not in time
im in time
thank god im in time
joe stares at him
its a no go
no one any the wiser
he makes a cow herding motion with his hands
you can go home now
thanks so much
joe takes out his gun
its all over
this has no effect on joe who is unscrewing his silencer
miles is exasperated
suddenly marylin appears
its a no go joe
its okay joe
joe glances at both of them with barely concealed contempt
he works for you
but first he worked for you
you were going to have this thug
wait just a second there
you sent him here
you unearthed this pestilence
youre calling me a pestilence
thats a hoot
to joe im sorry
that was unkind and but we changed our minds
to miles did you really mean what you said on the phone
it wasnt because you found out about rex
marylin im your husband
id be entitled to rexs money
no matter what happened to you
lemme tell you something
you are the pestilence
im the exterminator
oh joe be happy for us
ill pay you the twenty thousand
it was fifty for you
to miles thats cause youre a lawyer
i gave her the lawyer discount
looks at marylin but i shouldnt of
cause youre a whore
a whore who worships the dollar
well actually all whores worship the dollar if you want to get technical
i was a lawyer
just like you
and my clients
whores just like you
were you with a firm
i know kaplan
youre joe gittelson
i knew you looked you were great we studied you
twenty years in matrimonial law and it made me sick
he wheezes i broke up homes and families never givin it a second thought
till one day
i had an epiphany
you know what that is
they nod came with a damn stigmata if you can believe that
i said to myself joe everyone you see wants blood
everyone wants their exs dead
so why jerk around with rest
you wanna best serve your clients
joe is raising the gun at miles
miles sprays him with mace
bang joe fires blindly scrunching his eyes against the chemical sucking for breath like a jet engine revving for a take off
slam marylin elbows him in the face breaking his nose
she finishes with a solid groin kick
it slows him down but doesnt stop him
joe stumbles a bit but regains his footing
bang joe is rampaging around the room still firing thumping at his chest with his free hand for his inhaler
marylin runs to miles
he takes her hand and they run toward the door seeking egress
bang still firing he pulls out the inhaler but blindly bobbles it
joe reaches with his gun hand to keep the inhaler from falling
he momentarily bobbles both gun and inhaler
miles pops up in front of him
ill distract him
im not leaving you
i took self defense joe recovers and raises the gun to his mouth as he points the inhaler at miles
he squeezes whush miles squints against the asthma mist and lets out a horrified joe
the off screen gunshot is followed by the sound of a body dropping heavily to the floor
marylin runs over to miles
they look sadly down at the floor
we told him it was no go
wrigley sits bouncing the steepled fingers of one hand against the other
miles sits gazing sadly out the window
the room is empty
there is the whir of ventilation
the click of the door attracts both their attention and brings them to their feet
marylin walks in chic and beautiful as ever followed by ruth who sits next to her places her attache case on the table top and snaps its clasps
miles and marylin are looking at each other
quietly hello marylin
hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us
its not something i wanted either
but then i guess something inside me died when i realized that youd hired a goon to kill me
its exactly how i felt when i realized youd hired the goon to kill
now you both wait a minute
nobody hired anyone to kill anyone
there is an uncomfortable shifting in seats
wrigley looks at miles
apparently from what i can gather a burglar broke into your house became despondent over his lifestyle and shot himself
miles is still looking at marylin
where does that leave us
weve outlined a settlement
she pushes a piece of paper across the table
we think its more than generous
miles ignores the paper which lies unclaimed on the middle of the table
he looks at marylin
my client is prepared to consider a reconciliation
marylin looks a miles
how could i trust you after
after all of this
miles staring at marylin cuts in you wounded me first marylin
your forgetting rex rexroth
youre forgetting howard doyle
income tax evasion
i dont see how we can ever find our way back from
miles with his eyes still on marylin reaches into his suit coat
he withdraws a piece of paper spreads it flat on the table in front of him and still gazing at her you know
theres nothing in the massey pre nup that says it cant be executed after the parties wed
he decisively clicks the button on a ballpoint pen looks down at the paper in front of him and scribbles his name
he pushes the paper across the table toward marylin
gazing at him seeking the truth in his eyes she absently picks up the paper
there is a long silence
we hear only the hum of ventilation and wrigleys quiet snuffling
ruth is looking down her nose through her glasses over marylins shoulder at the sheet of paper
marylin however looks only at miles
its the massey pre nup marylin rips the paper in half
bored o kay
im going back to the office wrigley sobs openly
come on wrigley ill buy you a drink and an anti depressant
no one will ever love me that way
not if youre lucky
miles rises slowly to his feet
he puts his knuckles on the tabletop and leans forward
marylin rises slowly to her feet
she leans forward
lets go home
we hear a smashing breaking
gardeners look up briefly from the leaf blowing but quickly prioritize and continue blasting sycamore leaves from one end of the yard to the other
the smashing is becoming louder
breaks the beautiful wood panelling in the room next to the master suite
just wait for one minute
sweet jesus are you crazy
hes the one wielding the axe
his co worker casts a look in our direction
reaches under the rubble and removes one box of cohiba especials
thought you cleared that shit out
you know man
those thingsll kill ya
i know all you old boomer potheads like em
theyre illegal and you get to put em in fancy boxes but shit man
its still tobacco
you know sweets hes right
miles casts a rueful look at the cigars
they were created during a dictatorship
placing a protective hand on her big belly what if something happened to you
what would i tell little gus when he asked what was my daddy like
miles looks at the box then at his wife
he tosses the box to the concerned construction worker
these are for you
the construction worker gives him a very hostile look
now i can die
youd say they devoted a whole semester at harvard to your dad
but your mom was the one that ever only nailed his ass
i thought so
