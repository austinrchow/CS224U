written by courtney hunt a sign reads bridge to canada
a steep s era customs bridge arches over the st
cars and trucks line up in different lanes
customs officials inspect and question impatient drivers
beyond them a smaller sign thank you for visiting massena new york it works for business for family for you
the river stretches for miles in either direction frozen and still with trees on either side
ray eddy a bit worn for her years with a long red ponytail wearing an old bathrobe sits in the passenger seat of her red plymouth horizon with the door
open smoking a cigarette thinking
her breath is visible in the cold morning air
her bare feet rest on the cold ground
her s rusted out trailer home sits in front of her on cinder blocks at a slight tilt
beside it a small shed and behind it the concrete foundation for a house
around her the yard is littered with junk a rusted ski lift chair the front end of a plymouth duster and a smiling duck kiddie ride
beyond the yard flat winterbare land
after a moment a lanky boy of her son troy jr
leans out the trailer door
were out of captn crunch
his breath is visible in the cold
just give him toast
we got no butter we got no jelly
ray is out of ideas
he expects her to move but she stays still
he looks around the yard
what are you doing
listening for the trucks
are they really coming
she is silent
says it slow wheres dad
she looks at him
i dont know how he found it t
ray takes a drag off her cigarette
walks over to the car
i locked it in my glove compartment
looks in at the open and empty glove compartment
that was stupid
yeah i see that now but the trucks were coming before the bank opened
did you tell him you had it
no i guess he just sniffed it out
the glove compartment
thats the stupidest place you could have put it
he hasnt bought a scratch card in almost thirty two months
i thought it would be okay
did he leave anything
she shakes her head
what are you gonna do
you could look for him
he could be anywhere
we should look for him
the rez with more than four thousand dollars hes probably in atlantic city by now
so lets go lets find him before he blows it all
what do you mean
i just cant do it anymore
but hell lose it all
we cant make him stop
he stole our money
call the troopers
its not stealing if you take it from your family
anyway he made some of it too
so youre just gonna sit there
in the distance the rumble of trucks
ray hears it
it gets louder
another christmas in the tin crapper
goes into the shed and slams the door
ray throws down her cigarette and goes into the trailer
she looks around the cramped trailer at the oversized rentaworld furniture including a big screen tv
an enlarged wall photograph of the family catches her eye
in it her husband troy sr
wearing a forced smile his long shaggy hair combed flat for the picture
ray hurries down the hall to her bedroom and takes off her bathrobe she has several tatoos and slides into a pair or jeans and a t shirt
a sleepy eyed toe headed boy ricky walks in shirtless in pajama bottoms eyes shining
is it here
ray stops what shes doing when she sees him and kneels down
hey little sleepy head
is it here yet
cause im ready
he drags a suitcase full of plastic dinosaurs around the corner
the rumble outside grows louder
ricky bolts out of the bedroom and down the hall to the trailer door
wait a sec he bursts into the yard where a pick up truck draped with a wide load banner leads two semis hauling halves of a double wide mobile home
wrapped in plastic rippling in the wind
ricky stops at the massive sight twisting at his fly trying not to pee himself
comes out of the shed
the doubles come to a stop and idle in the yard
guy versailles pot bellied in a green velour running suit squeezes out of his truck
on the door massena ricky grabs a rope hanging off one of the doubles and tries to climb the side of it
the truck driver looks down from his cab
to ricky get down
ray peeks out the kitchen curtain
after a moment she comes out of the trailer with a pasted on smile
were all ready for ya
she points to the new concrete foundation
he consults a clipboard
well need the balloon payment to unload
looks at ray
we have it its just that they called troy from titus last night
thats where troy works
the ski place
and anyway have you got the dollars or not
it was some emergency with the lifts
so he took off without thinking with the money
completely forgot you were coming
so as soon as he gets back whens he gonna be back
as soon as he can get here ill just run it down to you
could crawl out of his skin
ironic smile this is the second time youve dragged me out here
if you dont come up with it by christmas youve lost your fifteen hundred dollar deposit
he walks toward his car
she follows him
versales i have a good job at all for a dollar
theyre probably gonna make me a manager after christmas so i can handle the payments if you just leave the house
he gets in the car
call me when you have the balloon payment
he makes a circle in the air with his hand and the semis rev their engines and grind into reverse
ill call you
her voice is drowned out by revving engines
ricky rushes to her
wait where are they going
she takes his face in her hands
listen to me
well get them back
but why are they leaving
ricky ill get them back
i promise honey
thats our house
he breaks away from her and runs down the road chasing after the semis
ray chases after ricky until he runs out of steam and stops panting
she catches up to him and tries to hug him
he pushes her away
she gets down on her knees and takes his face in her hands
were gonna get it back
she picks him up and walks back to the trailer
ricky looks out mournfully at the trailers disappearing down the road
you better hurry or youre going to miss the bus
lets get your clothes on ricky
just stares at her
i can get a job you know
they wont ask any questions
youre finishing school
come on you dont think we can live on what you make at all for a dollar do you
youre going to school
she goes inside
i bet i could make more than you do
she ignores him
ray helps ricky into his clothes and puts his backpack on his back
ray and t
look at each other
hell be back
arent we even gonna look for him
im going to work and youre going to school
the only thing that changed is that your dad started gambling again
everything else is the same
where did he go
he had to take a business trip
rolls his eyes
arent you even gonna look for him
and miss a day of work
we just have to live our lives
now go get your backpack
when is daddy coming home
i dont know ricky
i cant believe youre not even gonna look for him
where do i look
he cant answer the reservation
i told you he could be in atlantic city by now
she helps ricky get his backpack on and gives him a kiss
shakes his head the glove compartment
thats so stupid
youre going to school
he follows ricky out the door to catch the school bus rolling up out front
suddenly ray remembers wait wait
they turn around
she digs in her pockets
they take it and keep running for the bus
ray looks after them and reaches for her cigarettes
she takes out her second to last one
she lights it and takes out her mascara
she tries to put it on the bathroom mirror but her tears keep getting in the way
ray stacks shelves with a knock off version of plastic my little pony in a messy aisle of boxes
matt her boss bone thin with bad skin walks by
could i talk to you
he looks at her
i need to come on full time
matt blinks with a blank expression then i see you as a short timer
what is that
a short timer
not here for long not really committed
ray follows him to the stock room
when i started you said it would be six months before i could come on full time
and that was two years ago
he opens a can of red bull and takes a sip
its my opinion
well i mean you know i do show up
pats late everyday
shes late now
shes always late
he stares blankly at her
she can think of nothing else to say
he walks out
ray resumes unpacking ponies
a moment later pat rushes in looking sorry
as pat hangs up her coat ray glimpses a tatoo just above her low riding pants with the words how you doin
ray takes the last of her cigarettes out of the pack and heads out the back door
see ya tomorrow
ray drives down a two lane highway
it is empty flat land but for a few trailer homes and barns
she passes a lonely sign bridge to canada
up ahead another sign akwesasne land of the mohawk
from the car the reservation consists of shabby houses with no siding tax free gas stations and dive bars with homemade signs
ray slows a little to check out the parking lots scanning for her husbands car
up ahead she sees a sign wolf mart tax free gas and ray pulls in to the combo gas station restaurant and mini mart
a mohawk teenager wearing a bandana runs out to the car without a coat rubbing his hands together to ward off the cold
fill it up
she rolls down the window digging for change under the seat of her car
she counts it out
two seventy one two three four
two seventy four
he nods and goes to the pump
she finds a wadded up five dollar bill
yells out window make that seven seventy four
she spots a sign for trailways bus in the window
did you see a blue acclaim come in here last night
no but i only worked until pm
you can ask inside
ray glances inside at the mostly empty restaurant but for a few older mohawk women
no thats okay
did you want to support our mosquito lacrosse league
it teaches basic lacrosse skills to the kids three to five
ray shakes her head
have a good day
ray continues down the highway through the reservation
she comes to a huge warehouse the mohawk bingo palace
she glances over at the sea of cars surrounding it
at the end of a row she spots it a blue acclaim
ray abruptly turns in
ray pulls up alongside the acclaim and recognizes it by the easy does it bumper sticker
she gets out and looks inside
there is a small plastic t rex on the floor of the backseat
she leans against the car for a moment
oh god thank you thank you thank you
after a moment ray looks up at the bingo palace and heads for the entrance
you son of a bitch
a short chubby mohawk ticket taker in her s with piercing blue eyes and missing teeth sits perched on a metal chair beside a velvet rope
sunrise session is almost over
next session starts at
i just need to look inside
ray starts to walks toward the door and the ticket taker sticks out her foot
its dollars for admission
i dont want to play i just need to look around for a second
im gonna need the five
ill stand right here at the door
i wont even go inside
i just need to see if my husbands in there
you still gotta pay admission
hes gambling away the money for our house
what does he look like
long brown hair
hes not in there
can i just look
i told you lady hes not in there
ray walks away
the ticket taker watches her
ray walks out of the front entrance back across the parking lot toward the horizon through rows of cars
across the parking lot lila littlewolf a mohawk girl with long black hair bursts out of the employees entrance and hurries across the parking lot pulling off her scratch card
apron as she walks
ray catches sight of her but before ray reaches the horizon lila reaches the acclaim gets in it and backs hey
but lila drives off
ray jumps back in the horizon and takes off after her
ray follows the acclaim down route and catches sight of it turning off on a dirt road
ray makes the corner just in time to catch sight of the acclaim bouncing off on a path through the woods
ray follows it through the woods to a clearing the acclaim stops in front of a rusted out bubble camper
lila gets out
ray pulls up behind her and rolls down her window
thats my car
lila spins around
points to the acclaim what are you doing with my car
lila fingers the keys in her hand
i found it
you stole it
the keys were in it
so you just took it
lila goes in the bubble camper and shuts the door behind her
ray gets out of the horizon and walks up to the camper door and takes out her cell phone
well just see what the troopers say about that
from inside camper go ahead they got no jurisdiction here
this is mohawk territory
ray stops dialing closes up her phone then goes to her car and takes the gun and goes back to the camper
knocks with the gun you can cut the bullshit and give me my keys now
there is no reponse
ray waits for a moment and then low voice troy are you in there
there is no response
if youre in there you better come out
lila sits on an army cot in the dingy camper next to a lamp on the floor
her clothes are scattered among empty pringles cans
tentative controlled troy
versales says as long as we get the money in by christmas we wont lose the deposit
pause i think we need to talk about this so come on out
ray aims the gun and fires into the camper door
the shock of the blast throws lila off the cot
she looks at the smoking hole
im not kidding honey come on out
keeping behind the door for cover lila opens it
ray looks inside there is no sign of troy
from behind the door the tribal police dont like people shooting holes in other peoples houses
ray looks at her
this is new york state so quit the bullshit and give me my damn keys
lila throws the keys out the door
ray picks them up off the ground
lila shuts the door with her foot
ray gets in the horizon and pulls it in behind the acclaim then digs in the trunk pulling out a rope
she ties one end to the acclaims back fender and the other to the horizons front fender
lila watches out the camper window
ray gets in the acclaim and starts it up slowly towing the horizon a few feet before the rope snaps
ray gets out and looks at the broken rope
she begins digging in the trunk for more rope
lila opens the camper door and looks at the bullet hole
this camper belongs to my brother in law
he wont like this
over her shoulder then you should quit stealing cars
i thought it was abandoned the guy driving it got on a bus
did you see where the bus was headed
new york or buffalo im not sure
ray re ties the tow line with the remaining rope
this time the horizon goes an inch or two before the rope snaps
ray gets out
under her breath shit
ray rifles through the trunk for more rope
home on the range plays on the cell phone in rays back pocket
lila touches the bullet hole in the camper and listens to rays conversation from the doorway
ray puts the phone back in her pocket and takes an old belt of her husbands and tries to attach the fenders of the cars
ray gets back in the acclaim and tries towing the horizon once again
this time the right side of the front fender snaps off and droops to one side
ray gets out and looks at lila
im not leaving this here
points at the acclaim i got a friend who might buy that
its not for sale
hell pay more than its worth
ray ignores her
maybe two thousand
hes always looking for cars with button release trunks
ray thinks about it
he dont need papers or anything
does he use them to rob banks or something
all i know is he pays good for a car like this
where does he live
through the woods
whats in it for you
hell give me something for finding it
if you try anything im not afraid to use this
ray drives with one hand and holds the gun with the other
it is pointed at lila in the passenger seat
turn up there
where that stump is
ray makes the turn with one hand and the car bounces through an overgrown path in the woods
ray reaches the stump
nervous theres no road
theres a path
its not far
ray turns and drives into deeper woods
the gun jiggles around in rays hand as they bounce along between the trees
lila tries to ignore it
the car emerges from the woods at a boat ramp leading to a mile wide section of the frozen st
ray looks out at the ice
tire tracks make a path across the snow covered surface between carefully set out cut not too fast
im not crossing that
dont worry they already put out the christmas trees
theres no black ice
no its mohawk land
the rez is on both sides of the river
what about the border patrol
theres no border
im still not crossing that
dont worry itll hold a plymouth
ive seen semis cross it
ray looks at lila suspiciously
the only other way is the cornwall bridge and they wont let you take that
points at the gun
suddenly a truck driven by a mohawk teenager roars out of the woods and swerves around the acclaim fishtailing then speeding out across the ice
they plow it and everything
cautiously ray lets off the brake and rolls down the boat ramp towards the smooth surface of the river
under her breath this is so fuckin stupid
not too fast there are ruts
the acclaim moves across the smooth surface of the river
ray stares straight ahead clutching the wheel barely breathing
lila glances at the gun in rays hand then out at the river unfazed
they reach the midpoint of the river and pass it silently
you gotta pick up some speed to get up the bank
ray speeds up
the acclaim bounces up the steep bank
its just on the other side of those trees
ray and lila pull into a used car lot surrounded by a chain link fence
there is no sign of life
honk the horn
suddenly from under a gutted truck a huge black dog part wolf springs onto the hood of the acclaim
ray is pinned against her seat at the sight of the dog
lila grabs the gun out of her hand and points it at ray
just keep your mouth shut
ray stares at the snarling dog
just keep it shut
ray nods never taking her eyes off the dog
lila honks the horn again and keeps the gun low and out of sight
out of the garage comes jimmy a stocky mohawk eating a sandwich
jimmy looks suspiciously at ray before he sees lila
the dog growls ferociously at ray
get back under there
thunder jumps off the hood and disappears back under the trunk
jimmy walks around to the passenger side of the car
lila rolls down her window
jimmy glances at ray
he dont like whites lila
and your late
i shouldnt even be dealing with you
he hands her a paper bag
jimmy goes back to the garage and opens the door
two young chinese men in cheap jogging suits follow him out looking around
lila hands the paper bag to ray and points the gun at her keeping it low and out of sight
whats going on here
just count it
ray opens the bag
its full of cash
all fifties and hundreds
ray counts it
how much is there
lila opens the glove compartment and presses the trunk release
jimmy motions to the chinese men to get in the trunk
jimmy shuts it
he taps twice on the hood of the car and walks back to the garage
to ray lets go
wait who the fuck are they
just back up
im not moving until those people get out of my trunk
ill give you half
now lets go
jimmy turns around sees the two women arguing and gets suspicious
im not taking them over the border
thats a crime
theres no border here
this is free trade between nations
this isnt a nation
lila jams the gun into rays side
under her breath lets go
jimmy starts back toward the car
ray puts the car in reverse and backs up
the acclaim drives down the bank onto the frozen river and starts across
lila sits angled toward ray with the gun trained on her
whyd your husband leave you
maybe he wanted a younger women
ray stares out at the ice
thats what usually happens
ray says nothing
i never have to worry about that
my husband is dead
went down in the river on a run
they never found him
probably tangled in river weeds
she gives ray a spooky look
you better slow down there are ruts out here
you could get stuck in one
ray speeds up and roars up the boat ramp off the ice skidding a little
ray and lila bounce through the woods with lila holding the gun this time
they come to a dirt road then to an intersection with state route
ray slows down at the sign
what if the troopers stop us
they wont stop you
ray keeps going
just beyond the reservation line partly hidden behind a barn a new york state trooper vehicle sits parked
ray pulls into a s strip motel
a pakistani man the dealer looks out from the motel office
ray sees the dealer hurrying towards them
pull around back then wait for him to come to the window
lila keeps the gun low
the dealer approaches cautiously
roll down your window
he walks up slowly and hands her a brown paper bag
ray opens the bag and counts out the cash as before
lila takes the cash from ray and pops the trunk release
the two chinese men hurry out
the dealer ushers them into a garage
ray and lila return down route past the sign lila keeps the gun on ray
turn down there
ray looks at the dirt road leading into the woods
now open the door
lila jams the gun in her side
open the door
ray opens the door
now get out
ray doesnt move
you cant have my car
you cant have my car
lila tries to push ray out the drivers door with her feet
ray clings to the steering wheel
suddenly ray grabs lila by the hair and pulls her head down to the car seat
lila hits ray in the head with the gun
gasps fuckin bitch
bleeding and holding lilas hair ray pries the gun out of lilas hand
lila grabs the sack of money jumps out of the passenger side of the car and takes off into the woods
ray chases her but lila is faster and gets ahead then disappears into the woods
ray stops panting and wipes the blood from her forehead
calls after her little bitch
ray stares after her for a long moment then gets back in the acclaim
ray drives up in the acclaim
wearing protective goggles works on the broken duck kiddie ride with a blow torch
he doesnt notice ray
ray covers over the cut with her hair and gets out and walks up behind him and taps him on the shoulder
he jumps and cuts the flame
i told you not to use that thing when im not here
if i get it working i can sell it
she looks at the rusted pieces of it
i dont care
dont use that thing when im not here
theyre coming to get the tv if you dont pay by four tomorrow
he notices the car
did you find him
where was the car
at the bus stop on the rez
i bet he went to atlantic city
you dont know that
yeah but you could figure it out
just find out what buses came through last and then what
chase him across the country
what happened to your face
what did you get in a fight with somebody
it was no big deal
you got in a fight for real
some indian chick tried to steal your dads car
i say we go back there and kick some mohawk ass
it doesnt matter

thats so stupid
i didnt have a tow rope
i still say we go back there and kick some mohawk ass
forget it t
did you and ricky eat
that would be kinda miraculous since theres no food in the house
popcorn and tang
ray goes towards the trailer
lila walks in off the road
mike the owner plays a handheld video game
she looks around the lot
in mohawk hi lila in mohawk mike
she glances at a row of beat used cars
hows life at the bingo palace
oh you know okay
she eyes a malibu

she holds out a wad of cash
ill give you a thousand for the malibu
on the windshield of the malibu in huge white letters
nothing with a trunk
that thing has been sittin here for six months
i dont want bernie in my face
he doesnt have to know
mike rolls his eyes
ray wakes up with ricky staring at her
mommy i was thinking

half asleep theyre gonna flatten it out and send it to china
theyre gonna melt it down and make little toys out if it
theyll send them back here so i can sell them at all for a dollar
and you can buy me some
ray puts out a breakfast spread of microwave popcorn and tang
im not eatin that again for dinner
we just have to make it to my paycheck on friday
what about rentacenter
she searches through the couch cushions
what about them
they said theyre coming to get the furniture if they dont get a payment by oclock

she finds change and hands it to him
here lunch money
she gives the rest to ricky
look i dont see why you wont just let me get a job with mitch

thats so stupid

whos gonna take care of him
going out the door i still say we should go back to the rez get the horizon and kick some serious butt
goes out the door behind ricky and slams it in rays face
ray slips into her jeans and goes to the bathroom mirror to put on her mascara
she cakes it on trying to ignore the cut over her eye but keeps looking at it
finally she stops and stares at herself
ray pulls up in front of the camper and stops
the horizon is still there and all is quiet
ray gets out holding the gun and a long rope goes to the bumper and begins to tie it to the other bumper looking over her shoulder every once in
while at the camper
once she has tied the cars together she gets back into the acclaim but instead of driving off she just sits there
after a moment she gets out with the gun and walks up to the camper
the bullet hole in the door has a sock stuffed in it
low tone i want my part
lila is asleep next to a rattling propane heater
knocks with the gun you hear me
lilas eyes pop open but she stays perfectly still
ray shakes the door handle
i want my part
lila sits up on her cot and puts on her jacket
i want my part
ill give you the money if you give me the car
the moneys gone
then i wanna get some more of those chinese
the door opens
ray steps back holding the gun
they look at each other
its gonna cost me to get that hole fixed
i froze last night
ray holds up her hair revealing the cut over her eye
i just need enough for the balloon payment on my doublewide then im out of this
im no criminal
its not a crime
you people can call it what you want to
i just want my double
they stand staring at each other for a long moment then ray walks over and unties the rope around the bumpers of the acclaim and the horizon
i dont usually work with whites
ray gets in the drivers side of the acclaim and starts it
after a moment lila gets in the passenger side
ray and lila drive across the smooth surface of the river
ray smokes with one hand and holds the gun with the other
how many bedrooms
i got kids
five and fifteen
i got a boy
ray looks at her
he lives with my mother in law
after a moment she stole him from me
right out of the hospital
tribal police dont get involved in stuff like that
lila looks out across the river at dusk with no expression
the ice looks clean and still
ray picks up speed to climb the river bank
ray and lila drive up in the acclaim
thunder springs out again caught by his chain just short of the car
ray flinches but keeps hold of the gun
jimmy walks out to meet them
lila rolls down her window
bernie was askin if id seen you
i told him no
i dont want any trouble with him lila
dont worry about it
jimmys cell phone rings
this guys been calling all morning
hes got two up at the old casino
jimmy takes the call
lila rolls up the window
whats going on
we gotta pick them up
an old casino through the woods
they used to have gambling there in the bootlegger days
ray and lila bounce through the woods to a collapsed building
an old black suv pulls up from the opposite direction facing them
two middle aged chinese men get out of the back
one carries an envelope
at the sight of ray and lila he stops and says something to the other one
both turn around and head back to the suv
the driver jacques bruno a large quebecois man wearing a full length fur coat gets out
he pulls out a long pistol and motions the men to the acclaim
what the hell is he doing
ray reaches for her gun
keep that thing down
bruno walks towards the acclaim
roll down the window and see what he wants
what the hell is going on here
just roll it down
bruno stands at rays window
ray slides the gun under her leg and rolls down the window
bruno hands her a tim hortons bag
she takes it
quebec french accent dey dont like de women driver
he hands ray the envelope of cash
ray nervously counts the money as the chinese men shiver outside
lila pops the trunk
bruno and the chinese men disappear around the back of the acclaim
they hear the trunk bruno comes back to rays window and taps on it
ray looks at lila
ray rolls down the window again
dis will keep dem from running
he hands her mens shoes and dirty socks
ray takes the belongings and rolls up the window and drives away
ray drives across the river
the socks and shoes are between them
why would they want to run
to get away from the snakeheads
the snakeheads pay to get them here and then they gotta work off what they owe
how much does it cost
forty fifty thousand
depends where theyre coming from
to get here
sometimes they gotta work for years to pay it off
disbelief to get here
no fuckin way
she gets a whiff of the socks
god those are ripe
she throws them into the backseat
they always stink
two more cars are seen coming toward them on the river
they swerve wide to avoid the acclaim
she speeds up to make it up the boat launch
ricky watches cartoons on the big screen tv
flips through the telephone book to the back section akwesasne and scans columns of names mostly either bonaparte littlewolf or threerivers
he chooses a name and dials the number
hello in a grown up voice is this mrs
bonaparte i have good news
im the business manager of mr
threerivers and i have been authorized to inform you that you have inherited money
are you still there
wait i dont want any money i want to give you money
you have inherited money from his computer fortune
he was the second richest man next to bill gates
he left you twenty six thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars
pause oh no you have no obligation whatsoever mrs
threerivers just a small processing fee of
dollars will authorize me to send out your first payment of thirteen thousand three hundred and seventy five dollars
you can put it on any major credit card
pause of course you can always refuse the money
sure i can hold
holds his pen poised to write and looks at ricky watching tv then at the clock
it reads pm
the acclaim emerges from a dirt road onto state route
up ahead a sign reads you are now leaving akwesasne land of the mohawk
the acclaim drives past
sitting in his new york state trooper vehicle partly hidden behind a billboard trooper mike napoli mid s olive skinned watches the acclaim drive by without expression
ray notices the vehicle
are they always there
yeah but they cant stop you unless you give them a reason
have you ever gotten caught
they gave me the choice of paying a fine or spending three months in jail
what did you do
i paid the fine
i made the money back in two nights of smuggling
but back then it was cigarettes and everybody did it
some of the troopers were into it too
but when they lowered the tax on cigarettes in canada most people got out of it and the rest switched over to chinese
the acclaim pulls around back
the pakistani dealer approaches the car and hands ray a paper bag full of cash
ray takes the money
right i know
well be sure its right
i dont wanna get stiffed
then why dont you count it
i got bad eyes
she counts it and nods at lila
lila pops the trunk and the barefoot chinese men get out
ray and lila look at them they look back blank and ungrateful
ray rolls down the window and tosses out their shoes and socks
ray swerves back out onto route
they continue down the road to the reservation line
after they pass the sign you are entering the land of the mohawk ray pulls over and stops
ray takes the money and consolidates it into one paper bag
what about mine
were even now
they stare at each other for a second or two but ray does not take out the gun
lila reaches for the door handle lila gets out
ray drives away
the kitchen clock reads
a rentaworld truck is parked outside
two large rentaworld men sit in it
sees them from inside the trailer
he comes outside
he walks up to the trunk
one of the men rolls down the window
my mom told me to give you her credit card number
weary we only take cash or money orders
well my mom might be late
shes got three minutes
goes back inside
ricky is glued to a cartoon
watches him checking out the window every few seconds for ray
a long moment passes with only the sounds from the cartoon
the rentaworld men get out of the car and start toward the trailer
from down the road the acclaim comes roaring along kicking up dust
ray swerves in and jumps out and runs up to the men
i got it right here
she waves a wad of fifties and twenties
two fifty five right
the men nod relieved
ray counts out the money
ricky bursts out the door and runs towards ray
she catches him in her arms and hugs him
stands at the trailer door watching as the men drive away
to ricky who wants to go the price chopper and get some capn crunch
wanna to go to the price chopper
walks out looking at the money suspiciously
whered you get that
a beat matt made me an assistant manager
is that so hard to believe
its been like two years
exactly and thats why he gave me a bonus
he isnt convinced
do you wanna go to the price chopper or not
gets in the car
near the river smoke curls from the chimney of a modest house
lila perches in a tree nearby with a can of pringles potato chips dropping every other one on the ground below where a huge white dog part wolf takes his
from the tree lila looks inside the window of the house where a baby boy little jake about a year old bangs his spoon on his high chair tray then
throws it down
evelyn littlewolf a tall thin mohawk woman with long hair pulled back picks it up and gives it back to him
he throws it again
she knows the game
she gives it back but the third time she holds it just out of his reach and laughs at him
he bangs his fists on the tray
lila drinks in the sight
abruptly the door opens and evelyn leans out
chance get in here before you freeze your ass off
the white dog looks up at lila who shakes the pringles can upside down to show its empty
chance goes inside
the door shuts behind him
lila stuffs a wad of cash in the can and jumps down from the tree
she leaves it near the front door and hurries into the woods
ray tucks ricky into the bottom bunk
the wind whines in the loose siding
ray stuffs a blanket around the window to block the draft
ray walks through the kitchen now full of groceries and opens a can of adirondack cola
the remains of two hungry man dinners sit on the table
she sits down in the living room
watches the local weather
temps will dip tonight and tomorrow
expect a clipper from northern ontario to bring to inches of snow and winds gusting miles an hour making it feel like minus
area farmers are advised to bring in livestock
more on this after a message

ray stares across the room at a pile of troys dirty flannel shirts
she gets up and picks up the pile to move it to the closet but feels something hard
from a shirt pocket she pulls out a stack of used scratch cards
she throws the shirts in the closet and reaches for her cigarettes
she takes out a glossy picture of her double wide dream home the commodore a gleaming pre fab structure with a landscaped yard and a family with paid for smiles
after a moment she takes the wad of cash out of her pocket and begins making stacks of fifties and twenties
the camper is buried in snow
a shiny suv pulls up out front
bernie littlewolf burly well dressed mohawk man gets out
he yells across the yard lila
i got a job for you
lila is sound asleep on her cot under three blankets next to the propane heater
bernies snow balls thump against the side of the camper
lila opens her eyes and looks out the window squinting at the snow glare
they got two people out sick today so if you get down there you got the job
get dressed i got coffee
he holds up a paper cup
she slips on her jeans with a sweatshirt
lila forces the door open against the heavy snow and steps outside
where is it

she grabs her coat and trudges across the yard
bernie hands her a paper cup of coffee
rita said you quit
she fired me
thats not what she said
well she should have
i cant see to count the money
i told you that
i come up short half the time

she sips the coffee
so where are we going
the tribal council needs someone to answer phones
she reaches for the door handle
you can answer a phone cant you
not with them
she starts to get out
he notices the horizon buried under the snow near the camper
suspicious whats that
i bought it
some white lady
he says nothing
taps his thumbs on the steering wheel suspicious
a long moment passes
what do you need a car for
to get to work
so i dont have to walk in the breakdown lane
last week i almost got hit by the plow
and you know what im talking about
it doesnt have a trunk
he stares at straight ahead
all right all right
ray rings up a counter full of merchandise for a heavyset customer in her s
the customer hands her a credit card
ray processes the credit card
it is declined
didnt go through
the customer looks up with exaggerated annoyance
in a low voice i can try to put it though again
the customer grabs her purse from the basket and walks out the door leaving the merchandise
yells back at ray you got a problem with your machine lady
ray moves the merchandise aside for the next customer
it is trooper napoli
ray is startled to see him
he puts down some shaving cream and a diet pepsi
rings him up thatll be three seventy six
he digs in his pocket
i got exact
he counts it out
she hands him his bag and watches him walk out
mohawk paintings and a huge wolf carved out of wood decorate the waiting area
nearby is an office marked grand chief a mohawk woman walks by the desk and recognizes lila then looks away quickly
a tall middle aged woman grand chief rosalie comes out of the office and walks up to lila
do i have any messages
lila hands her a stack
she takes them and walks away then stops
i cant read this
she holds the message out to lila
lila tries to read it squinting
i think its a t
no i cant read any of it
i told bernie i couldnt see
lila grabs her jean jacket
she walks out
ray pulls up in heavy snow
lila gets in with a gallon of windshield wiper fluid
we gotta get extra fluid
i gotta get back before kmart closes
i got nothing for under the tree
ray fills the car with gas
lila goes inside to get some pringles
looking into the small restaurant she sees evelyn littlewolf her mother in law and little jake sitting at a table with grand chief rosalie
she stops dead in her tracks at the sight
they do not see her
slowly she walks up to the table
little jake notices her first
angle through the window ray catches sight of lila standing at the table perfectly still
the other women glance up at her then turn away
no one speaks
lila walks off with little jake still watching her
ray and lila drive across the smooth river surface
snow falls steadily
the windshield wipers snap back and forth
they barely avoid the oncoming headlights of another smugglers car crossing the ice
dont you people even take christmas eve off
mohawks dont celebrate christmas
you could fool me the way they were all lined up at all for a dollar today
those are christians
from the longhouse ways
thats awful not to have santa claus for the kids i mean
dumps the contents of a box containing the pieces of an artificial christmas tree
branches cover the floor
the boys begin putting it together like a puzzle
the tv is on
a commercial for the hot wheels tech track air stunt challenge set comes on
ricky trains in on it flinching and jerking his body with sound effects at the sight of the flying hot wheels cars and the booming voice of the announcer
daddy is gettin me that for christmas
what about santa claus
hes bringing the new house
ray and lila drive up
jimmy runs out with his jacket pulled over his head
he sees lila and signals to the garage
two figures start toward the car
as they get closer ray sees a man and a woman
theyre not chinese
what does that mean
theyre from pakistan
well wheres that
i dont know
what difference does it make
a big difference
the pakistani couple stand outside the car shivering and holding out the cash
the man carries a heavy duffle bag
ray rolls down the car window
the man holds out money to ray but she doesnt take it
if we wait much longer we wont be able to get back across the river
look im not driving just anybody across the border
do you want the money or not
i wanna know whats in the bag
ray looks out the car window and points to the bag speaking loudly
whats in there
the man looks at the woman
they dont understand you
well if they want to come over here so bad they oughta take the time to learn english
lila pops open the trunk
just hold on a second
ray gets out
the pakistani woman crawls into the trunk and the man picks up the duffle bag to put it in but ray takes hold of it
ill take that
ray motions him into the trunk and shuts it
then she opens the bag and starts to rifle through it but lila stops her
lila what are you doing
just count the money and lets go
ray looks down at the bag
nothing is visible but clothes
if we keeps snowing like this we wont be able to get across the river
i just hope these arent the ones that blow up themselves and everybody with them
ray zips the bag up and lila helps her slide it in the backseat
ray and lila get back in the car
ray starts to count the money
lila takes it back
we dont have time
the acclaim creeps along in heavy snow
lila struggles to count the money by the light of the glove compartment
is that a two or a five
glances down a five
ray creeps along straining to see out the windshield
the windshield fluid peters out
lila looks up
outside is a wall of white
you gotta stop so i can fill up the wiper fluid
im not stoppin
its a hundred feet deep out here if we get on black ice ray sticks her head out the window but the snow and the wind are too strong
lila gets out with the wiper fluid
ray pops the hood
ray looks in the backseat at the duffel bag
she hesitates a moment then reaches into the back and opens the back passenger door and slides the bag out of the car
lila gets back inside
what are you doing
nuclear power poison gas
you cant tell what they might have in there
im not gonna be responsible for that
ray tries the windshield wipers
fluid clears the windshield
ray dials her cell phone with one hand
hi im gonna be a little late

ray guns it up the boat launch to the shore
in the living room the artificial christmas tree is up
the tv is on and ricky is untangling a ball of red christmas lights
dials the phone hi is mitch there
a long pause the microwave dings
holding the phone t
takes out two hungry man dinners and sets them on the table
uh i was wondering if you still needed those numbers we were talking about cause i got one
cool but the thing is i dont really have any wheels at the moment
on moira road off
yeah but theres one more thing
he whispers into the phone inaudibly
no the air stunt challenge set
thanks a lot
he hangs up and puts the dinners on the table
to ricky ricky time to eat
ricky has wrapped himself in christmas lights from head to toe by slowly revolving while holding the strings
he plugs in the lights and they turn on
yeah thats pretty cool
but its gonna hurt when you sit down
now unwrap yourself its dinner time
ray and lila drive to the back of bobs
the dealer hurries out to meet them
he hands ray a wad of cash
she counts it then nods to lila who pops the trunk
the pakistani man and woman hurry out of the trunk looking around and rush to the passenger door of the acclaim speaking frantically to each other
the dealer tries to hustle them to the garage but they wont be moved
ray starts to back out but the dealer knocks on their window
ray rolls it down
heavy accent they say theres a bag
it was too heavy
we had to unload it
the dealer tells the woman in urdu
she becomes hysterical
she grabs ray through the window and the dealer pulls her off
whats the matter with her
she had something in the bag
the woman continues screaming in urdu
what is she saying
he speaks to her in urdu
she says her baby
her baby was in the bag
the dealer and the man hurry the wailing pakistani woman into the garage
lila and ray pull back onto route and drive along in stunned silence
it didnt feel like there was anything in that bag
we gotta go back
i cant believe they put their baby in a duffle bag
i cant believe you left it out there
if youd let me search it i would never have taken it we gotta go back
i know that
ray speeds along
partly hidden behind a barn trooper mike napoli watches the cars pass on route leaving the reservation
the acclaim passes
the trailer is aglow in christmas lights
ricky has fallen asleep on the couch
a car horn blows outside
a beat up car is there
inside a teenager mitch a few years older than t
hands him out a hot wheels tech track air stunt challenge set
thats what you wanted right
gives mitch a piece of paper with a list of names and credit card numbers including that of irene threerivers
thanks man have a merry one
j turns to go back inside
he sees smoke rising through the cracks in the siding and goes to the back
black smoke pours from under the trailer where old insulation is smoldering
runs to the shed takes a fire extinguisher and sprays under the trailer
the fire appears to be out
comes back in
smoke filters up though the cracks in the linoleum floor
he covers ricky with extra blankets and opens the windows
ray and lila drive down the boat launch to the river
the storm has stopped and the river is an endless white surface
ray and lila creep along
ray speeds up
faint tire tracks appear in the distance
slow down i dont want to run over it
i think it was here
ray stops the car
lila gets out
ray puts her jacket over her head and follows
rays cell phone plays old macdonald on the seat of the acclaim
wearing his coat in the trailer with the windows and door open t
dials the phone
he gets rays cell phone
faintly heard though the phone hi its me
i cant take the call right now but if its you troy please at least tell me youre alive because the boys are worried about you
he doesnt leave a message
ricky snores on the couch covered in a pile of blankets
lila runs ahead
ray struggles to keep lila in sight
ray comes up behind lila rifling through the unzipped duffel bag
she suddenly jumps back at the sight of the tiny face of an infant wrapped in blankets eyes closed lips blue
ray looks at the baby
instinctively she swoops down and gathers it up
ray heads for the car
lila follows her
ray gets in the car and sets the bundle down on the seat unwraps it from layers of swaddling and begins taking off its clothes
it is a boy
she tries to resuscitate him but there is no response
ray keeps giving it air
there is no response but she keeps at it
then between breaths tap the bottom of his feet
thats what they did to get ricky breathing when he was born
ray puts the baby on lilas lap
she pulls away
i dont want to touch it
well i cant hold it and drive
ray cranks the heater and aims the vents at the baby
lila stares down at the baby in her lap not touching it
i dont think it matters
at least put him next to your body
that will warm him up
but its too late
just do it
we cant give it back to her cold
closes the windows and puts a package of microwave popcorn in the microwave and turns it on
he watches it begin to smoke then pops open the microwave and takes the smoking bag from room to room to hide the smell of burnt insulation with burnt popcorn
ray pulls out onto route and passes the reservation line you are now leaving the land of the mohawk trooper napoli watches the acclaim pass again
this time he pulls out behind it
ray notices the cruiser following her
lila looks back
lila quickly pulls the baby near and wraps him inside her coat hiding him from sight
the dome lights start flashing
what do i do
just pull over
what if he saw us go by before
hes got no reason to stop us unless you give him one so keep your mouth shut
what if he searches the car
what do we say about he wont just remember youre white
ray pushes the blankets onto the floor and kicks them under the seat
ray pulls into the breakdown lane and the trooper pulls in behind her
in rays rear view mirror trooper napoli gets out of the cruiser
he puts on his hat and walks toward the car
ray rolls down her window
license and registration
ray hands them over
he examines them then leans down to the window
could you step out of the vehicle maam
fakely nice i wasnt speeding was i
just step out of the car
did i do something
suspicious maam im just directing you to step out of the vehicle
she gets out of the car reluctantly
he looks in at lila she keeps her head down
step around to the back of the vehicle
he follows ray to the back of the acclaim
he points at the trunk
ray stares at it afraid to speak
ray stares at the back of the car afraid to speak
your left rear parking light is not illuminated
ray notices the light
oh i didnt know
he takes out his pad and pen
im gonna give you a provisional citation
get this repaired in the next hours and youll have no problem
he looks into the car whos your friend
she looks after my kids when i have to work late
ray gets back in the car
he shuts the door behind her and gives lila a friendly nod
have an enjoyable holiday
yeah you too
she rolls up her window
in her rear view ray watches him get in his vehicle u turn and drive out of sight in the opposite direction
nervous what did he want
just a blown out tail light
looks at the clock
its after midnight
he leads ricky half asleep into his room and tucks him in bed
then he takes out the hot wheels box and puts it under the tree
ray and lila pull in to the motel but there is no sign of life
ray gathers up the blankets
lila sits motionless
we gotta take it in
lila sits absolutely still
what is it
are you sure
lila slowly takes the baby from inside her jacket
his eyes open
ray and lila stare at him
hello little baby
the baby looks back at them
he was just cold
ray and lila wrap him up in the blankets and get out with lila carrying the bundle and walk into the motel office
ray and lila look around the shabby motel office circa s with a few threadbare chairs
no one is at the front desk
ray ventures behind the desk and knocks on a small door
she carefully opens it to a small office with a desk cluttered with papers and beyond it another door
ray knocks and opens it to a living room hung with heavy red pakistani fabrics and lights
the dealer and the pakistani man study a map of new york state spread out on the table
behind them the pakistani woman sits on the couch
ray comes in followed by lila carrying the baby
we found him
the pakistani woman looks up sees the bundle and hurries across the room to lila
lila holds out the baby with a little smile and the pakistani woman snatches it out of her arms
the pakistani women pulls back the blanket and sees the baby alive
she sinks to her knees letting out a wail
lilas eyes fill with tears
ray chokes back her own
to lila come on
lila follows ray out looking over her shoulder at the baby
lila and ray drive away
he was dead
he was just cold
he was dead
okay whatever you brought him back to life
that was the great spirit not me
all i know is kmart is closed and i got nothing for under the tree
lila looks at ray
lila says nothing
look i dont have time for that
i cant get deep about every little thing
i just have to keep on going
i only need one more run to have enough for my double
ray and lila pull up in front of lilas camper and stop
ray divides the money
lila takes the money and starts to get out
merry christmas or whatever
lila gets out and goes inside
ray drives up
the trailer is covered in christmas lights
ray comes in
the box containing the hot wheels tech track air stunt challenge set is under the tree
she is suspicious
whered you get it
i called a friend
is that the friend you called
its probably stolen you know
no its not
well i dont want you hanging around him
that kid is bad news
its not like you were gonna get it
look mister i got more important things to worry about than toys
im trying to get our doublewide
hey you can lose the attitude
anyway kmart was closed by the time i got off work
he gives her a sideways glance
whats that smell
i told you to be careful with the microwave didnt i
a heavy thud as something hits the side of lilas camper
she opens the door but no one is there
at her feet she sees a pringles can
in it the cash she left at her mother in laws house for her son
she looks towards the woods but there is no sign of anyone
she shuts the door
inside she digs through an old box of junk and pulls out a foot long oval shaped wooden board an infant board and a blanket
she wraps her pillow in the blanket around the board in the mohawk tradition and picks it up
she tries it on her back then leans it against the wall then hangs it on a hook on the wall
ray stands at the stove in her bathrobe making pancakes
helps ricky set up his new hot wheels set
a knock at the door
ricky runs to the door and opens it then backs away
trooper napoli is there
is there a ray eddy here
ray comes to the door
can i speak to you outside for a minute
i havent gotten the light fixed its not about that
i just have a few questions
ray slips on her boots grabs her jacket around her and steps outside the trailer door
this is about the woman who was with you
how long have you known her
not too long
she looks after my kids
shes a smuggler
thats a shock
yes well there is that element on the reservation im sure you know
yeah ive heard about it but i didnt know she was involved
how did you happen to meet her
uh i think there was a sign for a baby sitter at the wolf mart
thats where i get my gas
i just thought you should be aware of that
shes known to have smuggled illegal immigrants into the country
oh my god
he nods his head
if i were you id find a new baby sitter
you dont want her around young kids
he eyes the side of the trailer where smoke stained siding is visible
well you have an enjoyable holiday
ray stands and watches the trooper drive away
she feels in the pocket of her bathrobe for her cigarettes and fumbles to light one sucking on it unaware of the cold
when she turns around she looks at the trailer and notices the smoke stained siding on one end of it
listens at the door
ricky looks up
why is the police man here
from outside the door t
could you come out here for a minute
ray stands staring at t
at the trailers burnt end
what did he want
did something happen to dad
then what did he want
she points to the blackened siding on the trailer
did you have a fire last night
the pipes froze so i fixed um
you fixed um
did you happen to use the blow torch
she walks around back and looks underneath the trailer a mass of charred and melted insulation
look at this
we cant live here anymore
its just a tin crapper
no it was our house
so were gettin a new one right
jesus you could have killed yourself and your brother
she grabs the blowtorch and slams it to the ground but it is indestructible
its not yours he gave it to me
she goes to the car takes out her gun then puts the blow torch on the ground and aims at it but t
put it down
put it down
are you gonna shoot me now too
put that thing down
he ignites the blow torch to spite her
maybe he didnt like gettin shot in his own house
maybe thats why he left
that was an accident
some accident you shot him in the foot
he spent the food money on scratch cards so hed done it before
he aims it at her
she walks towards him
he increases the flame
gimme that thing
she tries to grab it out of his hand but he is too strong
come on now
you cant have it
his eyes fill with tears but his face stays tight
she grabs at it again but he jerks it away
she pauses and stares at him
he was clean for months
they look at one another
chokes back tears i didnt know how else to keep us together
hes a good dad when hes not gamblin
he cuts off the blow torch
yeah awesome dad
robs us and takes off a week before christmas
she walks up to him and wipes a tear from the side of his face
he shakes it off
they stand in the cold air for a long moment their breath visible
she touches his hair
ray drives up in the acclaim
lila and the horizon are gone
ray gets out and looks around but there is no sign of her
ray slowly cruises the lot looking for the horizon
she spots it in the distance behind the bingo palace next to a dumpster
ray parks and goes inside
the short chubby toothless mohawk ticket taker perched on a metal stool beside a velvet rope
ray sees her and begins to dig in her jeans for a five
the ticket taker looks her up and down expressionless
ray hands over the money
the ticket taker just looks at her
the games over
theyre verifying the last winner
i still wanna buy a ticket
i cant sell you one
i got money
i just want to buy some scratch cards
go to wolf mart they sell um there
ray walks away
the ticket taker watches her
ray slumps down in the drivers seat of the acclaim waiting for lila to come out
she is parked a few cars away from the horizon
other bingo players come out and get in cars surrounding ray
mohawks employees including lila come out of the employees entrance
she starts toward horizon
she wears new glasses
catching sight of ray in the acclaim she abruptly turns and starts walking in the opposite direction
ray pulls out and drives over following her in the acclaim
i quit smuggling
rolls down the window t
set the trailer on fire
lila keeps walking
ray drives along beside her
he didnt mean to but the pipes froze and he got that damn torch out which i told him not to do touch when i wasnt there and he tried
to thaw them out i got glasses and now i can see up close
theres a hole in my bedroom floor
we gotta move
lila keeps walking
i just need one more run to get the double
lila keeps walking

lila keeps walking
i dont want it

lila keeps walking

i mean who puts their kid in a duffle bag
lila keeps walking
ray follows trying to figure her out
youre gonna need a lot of money to take care of a one year old baby
i got enough
yeah but you gotta get him first
lila stops dead in her tracks and looks at ray
ill help you
you can even borrow my gun
lila looks around to see if anyone is watching and gets in the acclaim with ray
angle from bingo palace entrance the ticket taker watches the acclaim drive away
ray and lila pull up outside the model double wide home
ray and lila look at it
you should see the inside
how many bedrooms
and its got a jacuzzi tub in the master bathroom
wall to wall carpet
but the best thing is the insulation
the pipes can never freeze
ray gets out
ill be back
she disappears into the office
lila looks at the house
ray comes in on guy versailles giving a young couple the hard sell
what i think youll find with the commodore and youll be the judge is that the vinyl wall covering is perfect for small children
there is never a need to repaint or even touch up i wanna schedule a delivery
versailles looks up annoyed
he plasters on a smile
to the couple give me just a second
he tries to take ray aside
what do you want
she pulls a huge wad of cash from her jacket pocket
is this all of it
its three thousand but i want it delivered tomorrow
i told you all or nothing
she holds out the cash
the couple tries not to watch
take it as a deposit
all you have to do is show up
if i dont have the rest you keep it
cant argue with that
youll have to sign something though
he takes out a contract and writes in the deposit amount as thirteen hundred seventy two dollars owing
ray signs the paper
ray drives down the boat launch and starts across
the sky is clear and the moon shines down on the white river surface
downstream patches of the river have thawed and water flows is visible
there is only the sound of the wheels on the smooth ice surface
jimmys is dark
ray and lila sit a minute
then blow the horn
ray honks the horn
a light comes on
jimmy runs outside in a t shirt
lila rolls down the window
you got a run for us jimmy
shakes his head its pretty slow after christmas
unless you wanna to go off the rez theres a guy up in montreal whos usually got heads
twenty miles or so
you gotta watch out for the mounties and the surete
this guy deals in ya know girls
ray and lila drive down a quebec highway
the road signs are in french
the skyline of montreal is an orange glow in the far distance
have you ever been there
a few times
no troy didnt like to travel
he liked to work in his shed mostly
ray and lila drive down a commercial strip of shopping centers fast food joints and strip clubs with french names
cant miss that
ray pulls in at a giant neon silhouette of a naked woman
they drive around back and get out
throbbing disco music is heard from inside a door marked prive
they walk in
the place is mostly empty
there is a scantily dressed bartender and jacques bruno sitting at the bar
she points to bruno
lila and ray approach him
he is on his cell phone speaking in french
he looks them over then closes up his telephone
french accent you looking for a job
no jimmy called oh yeah jimmy
he calls over the bartender
she comes over
he points to ray and lila
she walks over to them
softly put your hands up
ray and lila put up their hands
the bartender pat frisks them for body wires
when she is finished okay we go
he picks up his full length fur coat
they follow him out the back of the club
the bartender follows
dat your car
he points to the acclaim parked a few feet away
he walks out to a shed and unlocks the door
two very young chinese girls sickly and pale wearing jean jackets look vacantly out
bruno signals them to get out
open the trunk
we need to get paid first
he pulls a wad of cash from inside his coat and hands it to lila
she counts it out
you only got six hundred here
you get the rest at drop off
its six hundred apiece
the girls stand shivering by the trunk
thats the deal i make with jimmy now you want to change
lila and ray look at each other
its twelve hundred
you want to make a problem
bruno glances at the bartender watching from the back door of the club
annoyed by ray because youre not making a problem for me
and youre making a problem for them
let me show you something
he approaches the two girls
he grabs one of the girls by the hair kicks her in the back of the knees forcing her to the ground
lila looks at ray
the girl tries to get on her feet but each time she does he kicks her in the back of the knees again
to ray lets just go
held up by her hair the girl slides around helplessly
lila winces at the sight
ray stares at bruno
well take them
lila looks at ray
bruno drops the girl who scrambles to her feet
just open the trunk
lila leans into the passenger side of the acclaim and pops the trunk
bruno looks at ray
you must be the brains of the operation
he motions the girls into the trunk and shuts it after them
lila get in the passenger side and bruno starts for the back door of the club
ray pulls her gun out of her jacket and aims it at bruno
bruno stops and turns around
i want the rest
he opens his fur coat
cool i dont have any more
in the shiny coat lining only the handle of a long pistol is visible
to the bartender go get it
bruno looks around and nods at the bartender
the bartender panics not knowing what to do and begins speaking in french to bruno
ray shoots at the pavement beside bruno
to the bartender give it to her
the bartender disappears into the club
ray waits with the gun on bruno
from inside the acclaim lets get out of here
ill give you the rest of the money
youre gonna get us all killed
a moment later the bartender comes back shaking and holding cash
put it there
she indicates the trunk
to the bartender you arent so smart as you look
ray grabs the money and still pointing at bruno backs into the car
bruno reaches for his pistol and aims at them as the acclaim squeals away
bruno fires shattering the drivers side window grazing rays head
ray falls back dazed for a moment
then ray takes the wheel as they swerve out onto the main road
he shot me
ray wipes the blood from her forehead
you shoulda just taken the money from me
blood streams down her face im tired of people stealing from me
is it all there
we gotta get outta here first
just count it and make sure its all there
ray hands her the wad of money
lila struggles to put on her glasses and counts out the money
is it there
its all there
slow down a little
we gotta keep it under the speed limit
ray smiles and wipes away the blood
they drive a short distance
ray checks the rear view mirror
we gotta get off this road
lila looks in the rear view
headlights appear behing them
ray speeds up approaching an intersection the sign reads slow down
lila looks back in the rear view mirror
the headlights are gaining on them
she speeds through it
a local surete de quebec police cruiser parked out of sight takes off after her lights flashing
we gotta get off this road
ray swerves off the main road to a dirt road
the quebec police follow
ray swerves off the road and across a field into the woods and kills the headlights
the quebec cruiser chases them
ray speeds down the road
how much farther to the reservation
just up at the tree line
ray speeds towards it but the quebec cruiser still pursues them
what the hell
were on the reservation
they cant arrest us but if they catch us theyll take the money
ray bounces into the woods through the trees
the acclaim emerges from the woods at the edge of the river
the international seaway bridge looms above the ice surface of the river
behind them the flashing lights close in
that ice is black out here
will it hold us
i dont know
ray looks at her for a moment then drives toward the ice
behind them the quebec cruiser brakes at the edge of the river
the quebec officer gets out to watch the acclaim drive out across the ice
he radios to a border guard picks up the phone
he nods then hangs up and makes a call to
trooper napoli hears the call on the police radio
the quebec surete in pursuit of a vehicle with new york state plates identified as a blue plymouth acclaim and the suspects are two women suspected to be carrying illegals
he recognizes the car and u turns
ray and lila hold their breath as they cross the river
they make it over the midpoint and ray accelerates toward the shore
two hundred feet from the bank the back right tire hits a crack in the ice
the tire drops and the under belly of the car scrapes the ice
the right rear end of the car drops down and the front left tire lifts off the ice
the car teeters back and ray and lila sit perfectly still
we gotta crawl out the window
lila rolls down her window
the car shifts
the wad of cash slides toward the edge of the dashboard
ray grabs it
lila pops the trunk
the two chinese girls scramble out
the four begin running for the shore
trooper napoli watches the action on the ice
the car sinks deeper into the water on one side
ray lila and the chinese girls keep running slipping and sliding falling
lila and ray stop and go back to help one of the chinese girls who keeps falling
when they get to the shore they climb up the bank and collapse on the snow gasping
angle trooper napoli gets in his cruiser and heads down the bank toward the women lights flashing
two headlights are seen in the distance coming toward them
a pickup truck approaches along the shore
jimmy drives it
he gets out gathers ray lila and the two chinese girls into the back of the truck and drives away
ray looks back as the acclaim slips through the ice and trooper napoli reaches the scene too late
no one is there
a small house on the rivers edge with a hand painted sign bakery jimmy drives up
he helps ray lila and the chinese girls to the door
the ticket taker velma opens the door wearing an apron
jimmy i told you not to bring no more half frozen people in here off the river
ignores her we just need to borrow your oven mom
he leads them wet and freezing to the bakery kitchen
as they go by velma and ray recognize each other
an industrial oven sits beside an old couch
lila ray and the teenage girls stand near it shivering
velma looks them over frowning and shakes her head
i dont see how i can get any baking done
im supposed to be baking doughnuts for pee wee lacrosse and now i have people bleeding and dripping all over my kitchen
she opens a closet filled with indian medicine plants and takes out several kinds
to ray sit down i cant reach up that high
ray sits down
velma reaches up and dabs rays grazed and bleeding forehead
to ray looks like somebody tried to blow your brains out
ray winces in pain
get outta here jimmy
they gotta strip down
to girls gimme those jackets
velma motions to the chinese girls to take off their coats
they stare at her shivering
she gently goes to one of the girls and helps her out of her jean jacket
under it she wears a short sleeved shirt showing her bruised arms
velma sees the bruises
somebodys been beatin up on you
lila and ray see the girls black and blue arms
velma hangs the girls jacket on the big oven to dry and gives her an old blanket to keep warm
then velma turns to lila
mohawk chief of police billy three rivers a stressed looking man in his s talks on the phone
good good mike
what can i do for you
you say non native smugglers
a white woman
on the rez
ill look into it and give you a call back
pause ill take your request to the tribal council and give you a call back
no problem mike
billy three rivers sits down at a long conference table
a middle aged mohawk woman barbara sits behind a name plate reading chief
at the end of the table bernie sits behind another name plate sub chief
rosalie comes in wearing her coat over her bathrobe and takes her place behind the grand chief name plate
puts on her glasses billy
we have a situation with a couple smugglers
they got chased by the quebec police and crossed the river but their car went in and now the troopers know theyre on the rez
who is it
lila littlewolf and some white woman
what do the troopers want
a surrender of the two illegals and the non native smuggler
they need an example here
do you know where they are
probably over at velmas
to the other chiefs what do you think
turn them in
what about lila littlewolf
we got our own court system
we dont charge people with smuggling
maybe we should
if we did wed have to arrest half the people on the rez
rosalie and barbara shoot him an angry stare
we can expel her
you cant start throwin mohawks off the rez rosalie
theres only what six thousand of us as it is
she makes the mohawk people look bad
but she has a mohawk son
she cost us a mohawk son
jake was a big boy
he knew what he was doin shell never be anything but a smuggler
weve had smuggling on the rez since al capone
then well take a vote
two new york state cruisers block the road lights flashing
the bell on the bakery door rings
billy three rivers walks in looking very official
jimmy opens the door
he comes in and velma walks in from the kitchen closing the door behind her
velma seen any smugglers tonight
velma says nothing
come on billy you never bothered with smugglers before
rosalie is worried people are gonna think the mohawks let in terrorists
plus i got the troopers on my back
they want the illegals and they say theres some white lady with them too
is that true jimmy
jimmy looks away
you got white women doing it now
after a moment well if you see any let me know
three rivers leaves
lila and ray listen from the kitchen
ray eyes the back door
ray grabs her jacket off the oven and takes half the cash out of the pocket and hands it to lila
i gotta go
lila takes the money
the chinese girls look on confused
one gets up and grabs her jacket but ray motions her back
you stay here
ray hurries to the back door opens it but bernie littlewolf is there
at the sight of him ray backs up
he walks in
youre in a lot of trouble
lila looks at him unfazed
the council voted to expel you
for five years
you can appeal but youll never be able to change rosalies mind
they cant do that
theyll make your life miserable if you try to stay
theyve already done that
believe me it could get even worse
i thought this was all legal on the reservation
bernie ignores her
to lila look i gotta get home
she moves for the door but bernie blocks her
if she leaves theyll turn you in lila
the troopers want somebody
but shes a mohawk
the chiefs want her out so theres nothing standing between her and the troopers
listen my kids got no one but me
if you leave she wont see her son again
ray and bernie stare at each other
let her go
lila youre giving up on him and hes only one year old
to ray just go
ray goes to the door but turns around
at least you got family to take care of him ya know
ray shuts the door behind her and starts toward the river
she turns and runs along the bank
a long way
then slows down
breathing hard she stops
snow melts on her face
a long moment passes
the sound of the river ice pushing against the bank releases a long deep moan all around her
lila and bernie sit on the old sofa by the big oven
he might be better off
jake wouldnt agree with that
it was all for a new crib
i wanted the baby to have a pretty new crib not some handmedown
and he wouldnt let me go alone
laughs i was too fat to get behind the steering wheel
he wanted to keep you and little jake safe
the back door opens
ray is there
its just a few months right
bernie and lila turn around
ray walks in
i got baby stuff in the shed
she takes the folded double wide contract out of her pocket and holds it out to lila
get a good used single wide with insulation
insulation is the key thing
versailles will give you a hard time but that will leave enough for you and the boys to live on for a couple of months
rickys allergic to penicillin
a moment and you cant feed em pringles all the time
lila isnt sure
lila nods her head
but you gotta get there quick before the police cause t
will get scared
i dont want him to get scared you know
ray chokes back her own tears
lila takes the contract from ray
and dont let him jerk you around
versailles i mean
to bernie go with her
and ricky eat supper to the glow of the tv in the background
can i have more corn
dumps his own corn onto rickys plate
flashing dome lights of new york state troopers are seen just beyond the sign you are now leaving the land of the mohawk
trooper napoli waits in his cruiser with other vehicles
billy drives ray and the chinese girls slowly toward them in the mohawk tribal police cruiser
billy stops and the three get out of the car handcuffed
bernie waits in the car
lila walks to the front door
thunder looks up from beside the front step
shows her empty hands sorry thunder i got nothing for you
evelyn opens the door
seeing lila she tries to close it but lila wedges herself inside
evelyn tires to push her out but lila walks in the house
what do you want
lila walks up to the little jake sitting in his high chair his face covered in carrots
she reaches out to touch him but evelyn pushes her hand away
i need his coat
lila picks up the baby and looks around
wheres his coat
you cant have him
she grabs lilas arm but lila shakes her arm free and wraps little jake in her own jacket
say goodbye to your dudah
evelyn stands in front of the door blocking lila
lila stops and they stand for a moment looking at each other
there is anger and sadness
evelyn moves aside
lila walks out with the baby
bernie stands by the car holding a car seat
shes gonna kill me for taking this out of her car
ray sits in the backseat
the two chinese girls beside her
how long is it for me
you know if i confess
as long as theyre not on a watch list
he glances around at them
i dont think you have much to worry about judging from the look of them probably brought here to work in the sex trade
ray looks at the two girls
will they get sent back
they can apply for asylum
can i have a cigarette
he lights one for her
she takes it shaking
is there somebody i can call for you
to take care of your children

he looks back at her
trooper napoli looks at her
but i need to call my kid
the phone rings

she hears his voice and cant speak
mom are you there

there is a long silence
he wipes a tear away with his sleeve
ricky plays with his hot wheels on the floor
what does that mean

but i dont see why we need
pause a baby

he walks to it and opens it holding the phone
lila is standing there holding little jake wrapped in her jean jacket
and lila look at each other
she walks in
he hangs up
little jake sees ricky playing with the hot wheels set and reaches to get down
lila puts him on the floor
he crawls toward the christmas tree and the hot wheels set
to ricky youre gonna have to get the little pieces up high or hell eat them
ray rides in the back of the cruiser
they pass by trailer homes decorated for christmas
a semi roars down the road with wide load banner hauling a single wide mobile home through the bright morning light plastic covering rippling in the wind
using the blow torch t
works on the smiling duck kiddie ride
ricky plays with little jake dressed in a snow suit
lila comes outside with a plate of peanut butter sandwiches badly made
signals ricky who brings little jake over and puts him on the kiddie ride
ricky holds him on the seat and t
flips a switch
the ride jerks a few times then starts to move back and fourth
little jake smiles
a mohawk tribal police cruiser drives up
billy two rivers gets out and walks up to t
he speaks sternly to t
pointing at the cruiser where an elderly and frail mohawk women in her eighties mrs
threerivers looks out the window
walks over to the cruiser
she rolls down the window
he says something to her looking at the ground as he speaks
ricky and lila holding little jake look on
billy two rivers drives away
and ricky look up
a rumble is heard in the distance
from down the road the semi is seen t
smiles and ricky watches not sure whether to believe it or not
he takes t
ray is asleep in her new bedroom with wall to wall carpet and a big window
her cell phone rings
she doesnt move
her voice message plays hi happy youve reached ray

and tell the boys the message cuts off with a beep
close on the cell phone screen
new messages changes to new messages
a sign reads bridge to canada
a steep s era customs bridge arches over the st
cars and trucks line up in different lanes
customs officials man booths at the center of the bridge inspecting and questioning impatient drivers
beyond them a smaller sign thank you for visiting massena new york it works for business for family for you
the river stretches miles in either direction no longer frozen and still with trees on either side
