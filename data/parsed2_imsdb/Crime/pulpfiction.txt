american heritage dictionary new college edition a normal dennys spires like coffee shop in los angeles
its about in the morning
while the place isnt jammed theres a healthy number of people drinking coffee munching on bacon and eating eggs
two of these people are a young man and a young woman
the young man has a slight working class english accent and like his fellow countryman smokes cigarettes like theyre going out of style
it is impossible to tell where the young woman is from or how old she is everything she does contradicts something she did
the boy and girl sit in a booth
their dialogue is to be said in a rapid pace his girl friday fashion
no forget it its too risky
im through doin that shit
you always say that the same thing every time never again im through too dangerous
i know thats what i always say
im always right too but but you forget about it in a day or two yeah well the days of me forgittin are over and the days of me rememberin
have just begun
when you go on like this you know what you sound like
i sound like a sensible fucking man is what i sound like
you sound like a duck
imitates a duck quack quack quack quack quack quack quack
well take heart cause youre never gonna hafta hear it again
because since im never gonna do it again youre never gonna hafta hear me quack about how im never gonna do it again
the boy and girl laugh their laughter putting a pause in there back and forth
with a smile correct
i got all tonight to quack
a waitress comes by with a pot of coffee
can i get anybody anymore coffee
oh yes thank you
the waitress pours the young womans coffee
the young man lights up another cigarette
im doin fine
the waitress leaves
the young man takes a drag off of his smoke
the young woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her coffee
the young man goes right back into it
i mean the way it is now youre takin the same fuckin risk as when you rob a bank
you take more of a risk
banks are easier
federal banks arent supposed to stop you anyway during a robbery
theyre insured why should they care
you dont even need a gun in a federal bank
i heard about this guy walked into a federal bank with a portable phone handed the phone to the teller the guy on the other end of the phone said
we got this guys little girl and if you dont give him all your money were gonna kill er
did it work
fuckin a it worked thats what im talkin about
knucklehead walks in a bank with a telephone not a pistol not a shotgun but a fuckin phone cleans the place out and they dont lift a fuckin finger
did they hurt the little girl
i dont know
there probably never was a little girl the point of the story isnt the little girl
the point of the story is they robbed the bank with a telephone
you wanna rob banks
im not sayin i wanna rob banks im just illustrating that if we did it would be easier than what we been doin
so you dont want to be a bank robber
naw all those guys are goin down the same road either dead or servin twenty
and no more liquor stores
what have we been talking about
yeah no more liquor stores
besides it aint the giggle it usta be
too many foreigners own liquor stores
vietnamese koreans they cant fuckin speak english
you tell em empty out the register and they dont know what it fuckin means
they make it too personal
we keep on one of those gook motherfuckers gonna make us kill em
im not gonna kill anybody
i dont wanna kill anybody either
but theyll probably put us in a situation where its us of them
and if its not the gooks it these old jews whove owned the store for fifteen fuckin generations
ya got grandpa irving sittin behind the counter with a fuckin magnum
try walkin into one of those stores with nothin but a telephone see how far it gets you
fuck it forget it were out of it
well what else is there day jobs
laughing not this life
well what then
he calls to the waitress
then looks to his girl
the waitress comes by pouring him some more
snotty garcon means boy
its a coffee shop
whats wrong with that
people never rob restaurants why not
bars liquor stores gas stations you get your head blown off stickin up one of them
restaurants on the other hand you catch with their pants down
theyre not expecting to get robbed or not as expecting
taking to idea i bet in places like this you could cut down on the hero factor
just like banks these places are insured
the managers dont give a fuck theyre just tryin to get ya out the door before you start pluggin diners
waitresses forget it they aint takin a bullet for the register
busboys some wetback gettin paid a dollar fifty a hour gonna really give a fuck youre stealin from the owner
customers are sittin there with food in their mouths they dont know whats goin on
one minute theyre havin a denver omelet next minute somebodys stickin a gun in their face
the young woman visibly takes in the idea
the young man continues in a low voice
see i got the idea last liquor store we stuck up
member all those customers kept comin in
then you got the idea to take everybodys wallet
that was a good idea
we made more from the wallets then we did the register
yes we did
a lot of people go to restaurants
a lot of wallets
pretty smart huh
the young woman scans the restaurant with this new information
she sees all the patrons eating lost in conversations
the tired waitress taking orders
the busboys going through the motions collecting dishes
the manager complaining to the cook about something
a smiles breaks out on the young womans face
into it im ready lets go right here right now
remember same as before youre crowd control i handle the employees
they both take out their
caliber pistols and lay them on the table
he looks at her and she back at him
i love you pumpkin
i love you honey bunny
and with that pumpkin and honey bunny grab their weapons stand up and rob the restaurant
pumpkins robbery persona is that of the in control professional
honey bunnys is that of the psychopathic hair triggered loose cannon
yelling to all everybody be cool this is a robbery
any of you fuckin pricks move and ill execute every one of you motherfuckers
an old gas guzzling dirty white chevy nova barrels down a homeless ridden street in hollywood
in the front seat are two young fellas one white one black both wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long green dusters
their names are vincent vega white and jules winnfield black
jules is behind the wheel
okay now tell me about the hash bars
what so you want to know
well hash is legal there right
yeah its legal but is aint a hundred percent legal
i mean you cant walk into a restaurant roll a joint and start puffin away
youre only supposed to smoke in your home or certain designated places
those are hash bars
yeah it breaks down like this its legal to buy it its legal to own it and if youre the proprietor of a hash bar its legal to sell it
its legal to carry it which doesnt really matter cause get a load of this if the cops stop you its illegal for this to search you
searching you is a right that the cops in amsterdam dont have
that did it man im fuckin goin thats all there is to it
youll dig it the most
but you know what the funniest thing about europe is
its the little differences
a lotta the same shit we got here they got there but there theyre a little different
well in amsterdam you can buy beer in a movie theatre
and i dont mean in a paper cup either
they give you a glass of beer like in a bar
in paris you can buy beer at macdonalds
also you know what they call a quarter pounder with cheese in paris
they dont call it a quarter pounder with cheese
no they got the metric system there they wouldnt know what the fuck a quarter pounder is
whatd they call it
royale with cheese
repeating royale with cheese
whatd they call a big mac
big macs a big mac but they call it le big mac
le big mac
what do they call a whopper
i dunno i didnt go into a burger king
but you know what they put on french fries in holland instead of ketchup
i seen em do it
and i dont mean a little bit on the side of the plate they fuckin drown em in it
the trunk of the chevy opens up jules and vincent reach inside taking out two
automatics loading and cocking them
we should have shotguns for this kind of deal
how many up there
three or four
counting our guy
im not sure
so there could be five guys up there
we should have fuckin shotguns
they close the trunk
vincent and jules their long matching overcoats practically dragging on the ground walk through the courtyard of what looks like a hacienda style hollywood apartment building
we track alongside
whats her name
how did marsellus and her meet
i dunno however people meet people
she usta be an actress
she ever do anything i woulda saw
i think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot
whats a pilot
well you know the shows on tv
i dont watch tv
yes but youre aware that theres an invention called television and on that invention they show shows
well the way they pick the shows on tv is they make one show and that shows called a pilot
and they show that one show to the people who pick the shows and on the strength of that one show they decide if they want to make more shows
some get accepted and become tv programs and some dont and become nothing
she starred in one of the ones that became nothing
they enter the apartment building
vincent and jules walk through the reception area and wait for the elevator
you remember antwan rockamora
half black half samoan usta call him tony rocky horror
yeah maybe fat right
i wouldnt go so far as to call the brother fat
hes got a weight problem
whats the nigger gonna do hes samoan
i think i know who you mean what about him
well marsellus fucked his ass up good
and word around the campfire it was on account of marsellus wallaces wife
the elevator arrives the men step inside
whatd he do fuck her
no no no no no no no nothin that bad
well what then
he gave her a foot massage
a foot massage
jules nods his head yes
jules nods his head yes
what did marsellus do
sent a couple of guys over to his place
they took him out on the patio of his apartment threw his ass over the balcony
nigger fell four stories
they had this garden at the bottom enclosed in glass like one of them greenhouses nigger fell through that
since then hes kinda developed a speech impediment
the elevator doors open jules and vincent exit
thats a damn shame
steadicam in front of jules and vincent as they make a beeline down the hall
still i hafta say play with matches ya get burned
you dont be givin marsellus wallaces new bride a foot massage
you dont think he overreacted
antwan probably didnt expect marsellus to react like he did but he had to expect a reaction
it was a foot massage a foot massage is nothing i give my mother a foot massage
its laying hands on marsellus wallaces new wife in a familiar way
is it as bad as eatin her out no but youre in the same fuckin ballpark
jules stops vincent
stop right there
eatin a bitch out and givin a bitch a foot massage aint even the same fuckin thing
not the same thing the same ballpark
it aint no ballpark either
look maybe your method of massage differs from mine but touchin his ladys feet and stickin your tongue in her holyiest of holyies aint the same ballpark aint the same
league aint even the same fuckin sport
foot massages dont mean shit
have you ever given a foot massage
dont be tellin me about foot massages im the foot fuckin master
given a lot of em
i got my technique down man i dont tickle or nothin
have you ever given a guy a foot massage
jules looks at him a long moment hes been set up
he starts walking down the hall
vincent smiling walks a little bit behind
would you give me a foot massage im kinda tired
man you best back off im gittin pissed this is the door
the two men stand in front of the door numbered
what time is it
checking his watch seven twenty two in the morning
it aint quite time lets hang back
they move a little away from the door facing each other still whispering
look just because i wouldnt give no man a foot massage dont make it right for marsellus to throw antwan off a building into a glass motherfuckin house fuckin up
the way the nigger talks
that aint right man
motherfucker do that to me he better paralyze my ass cause id killa motherfucker
im not sayin he was right but youre sayin a foot massage dont mean nothing and im sayin it does
ive given a million ladies a million foot massages and they all meant somethin
we act like they dont but they do
thats whats so fuckin cool about em
this sensual things goin on that nobodys talkin about but you know it and she knows it fuckin marsellus knew it and antwan shoulda known fuckin better
thats his fuckin wife man
he aint gonna have a sense of humor about that shit
thats an interesting point but lets get into character
whats her name again
why you so interested in big mans wife
well marsellus is leavin for florida and when hes gone he wants me to take care of mia
take care of her
making a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head
take her out
show her a good time
dont let her get lonely
youre gonna be takin mia wallace out on a date
it aint a date
its like when you and your buddys wife go to a movie or somethin
jules just looks at him
its not a date
jules just looks at him
three young guys obviously in over their heads sit at a table with hamburgers french fries and soda pops laid out
one of them flips the loud bolt on the door opening it to reveal jules and vincent in the hallway
the two men stroll inside
the three young caught off guard guys are marvin the black young man who open the door will as the scene progresses back into the corner
roger a young blond haired surfer kid with a flock of seagulls haircut who has yet to say a word sits at the table with a big sloppy hamburger in

vincent looks up at jules
closing the case

out of his chair
vince smiles to himself
jules has got style

i didnt mean to do that
i believe you were saying something about best intentions
brett cant say a word
oh you were through anyway
well let me retort

jules snaps savagely tipping the card table over removing the only barrier between himself and brett
brett now sits in a lone chair before jules like a political prisoner in front of an interrogator

you ever read the bible brett

theres a passage i got memorized seems appropriate for this situation ezekiel
the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men
blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness for he is truly his brothers keeper and the finder
of lost children
and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers
and you will know my name is the lord when i lay my vengeance upon you
the two men empty their guns at the same time on the sitting brett
we fade up on butch coolidge a white year old prizefighter
butch sits at a table wearing a red and blue high school athletic jacket

the black man sounds like a cross between a gangster and a king
i think youre gonna find when all this shit is over and done i think youre gonna find yourself one smilin motherfucker

besides even if you went all the way what would you be
feather weight champion of the world

a hand lays an envelope full of money on the table in front of butch
butch picks it up

vincent vega looks really cool behind the wheel of a cherry red chevy malibu convertible
from the car radio rockabilly music plays

sally leroys is a large topless bar by lax that marsellus owns
vincents classic malibu whips into the near empty parking lot and parks next to a white honda civic

the front entrance is unlocked revealing the dapper dan fellow on the inside english dave
dave isnt really english hes a young black man from baldwin park who has run a few clubs for marsellus including sally leroys
vincent vega our man in amsterdam git your ass on in here
vincent carrying the black briefcase from the scene between vincent and jules steps inside
english dave slams the door in our faces
the spacious club is empty this time of day
english dave crosses to the bar and vince follows

vincents pov butch shakes hands with a huge figure with his back to us
the huge figure is the infamous and as of yet still unseen marsellus

butch is snapped out of his ass kicking thoughts
he pays english dave and walks out of the shot
a woman who appears to have a fondness for earrings
both of her ears are pierced five times
she also sports rings in her lips eyebrows and nose
ill lend it to you
its a great book on body piercing
jody vincent and a young woman named trudi sit at the kitchen table of a suburban house in echo park
even though vince is at the same table hes not included in the conversation
you know how they use that gun when they pierce your ears
they dont use that when they pierce your nipples do they
forget that gun
that gun goes against the entire idea behind piercing
all of my piercing sixteen places on my body every one of em done with a needle
five in each ear
one through the nipple on my left breast
one through my right nostril
one through my left eyebrow
one through my lip
one in my clit
and i wear a stud in my tongue
vince has been letting this conversation go through one ear and out the other until that last remark
interrupting excuse me sorry to interrupt
im curious why would you get a stud in your tongue
jody looks at him and says as if it were the most obvious thing in the world
its a sex thing
it helps fellatio
that thought never occurred to vincent but he cant deny it makes sense
jody continues talking to trudi leaving vincent to ponder the truth of her statement
vince you can come in now
lance late s is a young man with a wild and woolly appearance that goes hand in hand with his wild and woolly personality
lance has been selling drugs his entire adult life
hes never had a day job never filed a tax return and has never been arrested

three bags of heroin lie on lances bed

going into vincents vein
spurting back into the syringe mixing with the heroin
pushing down on the plunger
vincent walks toward the house and pulls a note off the door the note reads hi vincent im getting dressed
the doors open
come inside and make yourself a drink
mia hi vincent
im getting dressed
the doors open
come inside and make yourself a drink
vincent enters on the background
mia marcellus beautiful young wife
video screens are in the background
dusty springfield is singing son of a mias mouth comes toward a microphone
into microphone vincent
over intercom vincent

licks lips a video screen with an image of vincent walking
the dusty springfield song continues
mia turns a knob which controls the movement of the video camera in marcellus living room
vincent picks up a bottle of scotch
he sniffs the bottle and then pours it into a glass
a razor blade cuts cocaine on a mirror
vincent drinks a glass of scotch
mia sniffs the cocaine
vincent sips the drink and looks at a portrait of mia on the wall
mia walks into the room and takes the needle off a record
the dusty springfield song stops
in the past six years s diners have sprung up all over l
giving thai restaurants a run for their money
theyre all basically the same
decor out of an archie comic book golden oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly wurlitzer saucy waitresses in bobby socks menus with items like the fats domino cheeseburger or the
wolfman jack omelet and over prices that pay for all this bullshit
but then theres jackrabbit slims the big mama of s diners
either the best or the worst depending on your point of view
vincents malibu pulls up to the restaurant
a big sign with a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a red windbreaker towers over the establishment
underneath the cartoon is the name jackrabbit slims
underneath that is the slogan next best thing to a time machine
what the fuck is this place
this is jackrabbit slims
an elvis man should love it
come on mia lets go get a steak
you can get a steak here daddy o
dont be a
mia draws a square with her hands
dotted lines appear on the screen forming a sqaure
the lines disperse
after you kitty cat
compared to the interior the exterior was that of a quaint english pub
posters from s a
movies are all over the wall the crab monster and machine gun kelly
the booths that the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of s cars
in the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor
a big sign on the wall states no shoes allowed
some wannabe beboppers actually melrose types do the twist in their socks or barefeet
the picture windows dont look out the street but instead b w movies of s street scenes play behind them
the waitresses and waiters are made up as replicas of s icons marilyn monroe zorro james dean donna reed martin and lewis and the philip morris midget wait on tables
wearing appropriate costumes
vincent and mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red edsel
buddy holly their waiter comes over sporting a big button on his chest that says hi im buddy pleasing you please me
hi im buddy what can i getcha
ill have the douglas sirk steak
how dya want it burnt to a crisp or bloody as hell
bloody as hell
and to drink a vanilla coke

how dya want that shake martin and lewis or amos and andy
martin and lewis
did you just order a five dollar shake
milk and ice cream

vincent takes a look around the place
the yuppies are dancing the diners are biting into big juicy hamburgers and the icons are playing their parts
marilyn is squealing the midget is paging philip morris donna reed is making her customers drink their milk and dean and jerry are acting a fool
its like a wax museum with a pulse rate
vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling himself a smoke
after a second of watching him what are you doing
rollin a smoke
its just tobacco
well in that case will you roll me one cowboy
as he finishes licking it you can have this one cowgirl
he hands her the rolled smoke
she takes it putting it to her lips
out of nowhere appears a zippo lighter in vincents hand
he lights it
think nothing of it
he begins rolling one for himself
as this time the sound of a subway car fills the diner making everything shake and rattle
marilyn monroe runs to a square vent in the floor
an imaginary subway train blows the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out a squeal
the entire restaurant applauds
back to mia and vincent
marsellus said you just got back from amsterdam
i heard you did a pilot
that was my fifteen minutes
what was it
it was show about a team of female secret agents called fox force five
fox force five
fox as in were a bunch of foxy chicks
force as in were a force to be reckoned with
five as in theres one
five of us
there was a blonde one sommerset oneal from that show baton rouge she was the leader
a japanese one a black one a french one and a brunette one me
we all had special skills
sommerset had a photographic memory the japanese fox was a kung fu master the black girl was a demolition expert the french fox specialty was sex
what was your specialty
the character i played raven mccoy her background was she was raised by circus performers
so she grew up doing a knife act
according to the show she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife
but because she grew up in a circus she was also something of an acrobat
she could do illusions she was a trapeze artist when youre keeping the world safe from evil you never know when being a trapeze artists gonna come in handy
and she knew a zillion old jokes her grandfather an old vaudevillian taught her
if we woulda got picked up they woulda worked in a gimmick where every episode i woulda told and ol joke
do you remember any of the jokes
well i only got the chance to say one cause we only did one show
its really corny
cmon dont be that way
you wont like it and ill be embarrassed
you told it in front of fifty million people and you cant tell it to me
i promise i wont laugh
laughing thats what im afraid of
thats not what i meant and you know it
youre quite the silver tongue devil arent you
i meant i wouldnt laugh at you
thats not what you said vince
well now im definitely not gonna tell ya cause its been built up too much
what a gyp
buddy comes back with the drinks
mia wraps her lips around the straw of her shake
can i have a sip of that
id like to know what a five dollar shake tastes like
be my guest
she slides the shake over to him
you can use my straw i dont have kooties
yeah but maybe i do
kooties i can handle
he takes a sip
thats a pretty fuckin good milk shake
i dont know if its worth five dollars but its pretty fuckin good
he slides the shake back
then the first of an uncomfortable silence happens
dont you hate that
why do we feel its necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable
i dont know
thats when you know you found somebody special
when you can just shit the fuck up for a minute and comfortably share silence
i dont think were there yet
but dont feel bad we just met each other
well ill tell you what ill go to the bathroom and powder my nose while you sit here and think of something to say
ill do that
mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the bathroom sink
her head jerks up from the rush
imitating steppenwolf i said goddamn
vincent digs into his douglas sirk steak
as he chews his eyes scan the hellsapopinish restaurant
mia comes back to the table
dont you love it when you go to the bathroom and you come back to find your food waiting for you
were lucky we got it at all
buddy holly doesnt seem to be much of a waiter
we shoulda sat in marilyn monroes section
which one theres two marilyn monroes
no theres not
pointing at marilyn in the white dress serving a table
thats marilyn monroe
then pointing at a blonde waitress in a tight sweater and capri pants taking an order from a bunch of film geeks and thats mamie van doren
i dont see jayne mansfield so it must be her night off
i have moments
did ya think of something to say
actually theres something ive wanted to ask you about but you seem like a nice person and i didnt want to offend you
oooohhhh this doesnt sound like mindless boring getting to know you chit chat
this sounds like you actually have something to say
only if you promise not to get offended
you cant promise something like that
i have no idea what youre gonna ask
you could ask me what youre gonna ask me and my natural response could be to be offended
then through no fault of my own i woulda broken my promise
then lets just forget it
that is an impossibility
trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility
is that a fact
mia nods her head yes
besides its more exciting when you dont have permission
what do you think about what happened to antwan
tony rocky horror
he fell out of a window
thats one way to say it
another way is he was thrown out
another was is he was thrown out by marsellus
and even another way is he was thrown out of a window by marsellus because of you
is that a fact
no its not its just what i heard
who told you this
mia and vincent smile
they talk a lot dont they
they certainly do
well dont by shy vincent what exactly did they say
vincent is slow to answer
let me help you bashful did it involve the f word
they just said rocky horror gave you a foot massage
no and thats it
you heard marsellus threw rocky horror out of a four story window because he massaged my feet
and you believed that
at the time i was told it seemed reasonable
marsellus throwing tony out of a four story window for giving me a foot massage seemed reasonable
no it seemed excessive
but that doesnt mean it didnt happen
i heard marsellus is very protective of you
a husband being protective of his wife is one thing
a husband almost killing another man for touching his wifes feet is something else
but did it happen
the only thing antwan ever touched of mine was my hand when he shook it
i met anwan once at my wedding then never again
the truth is nobody knows why marsellus tossed tony rocky horror out of that window except marsellus and tony rocky horror
but when you scamps get together youre worse than a sewing circle
into microphone ladies and gentlemen now the moment youve all been waiting for the worldfamous jackrabbit slims twist contest
ed sullivan is with marilyn monroe who holds a trophy
one lucky couple will win this handsome trophy that marilyn here is holding
marilyn holds the trophy
now who will be our first contestants
mia holds her hand

i do believe marsellus my husband your boss told you to take me out and do whatever i wanted now i want to dance
i want to win
i want that trophy
sighs all right
so dance good
all right you asked for it
vincent and mia walk onto the dance floor toward ed sullivan
into microphone lets hear it for our first contestants
vincent and mia walk up to the microphone
now lets meet our first contestants here this evening
young lady what is your name
into microphone missus mia wallace
into microphone and uh how bout your fella here
into microphone vincent vega
into microphone all right lets see what you can do
take it away
mia and vincent dance to chuck berrys you never can tell
they make hand movements as they dance
the front door flings open and mia and vincent dance tango style into the house singing a cappella the song from the previous scene
they finish their little dance laughing
the two just stand face to face looking at each other
was than an uncomfortable silence
i dont know what that was
pause music and drinks
mia moves away to attend to both
vincent hangs up his overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove
im gonna take a piss
that was a little bit more information than i needed to know but go right ahead
vincent shuffles off to the john
mia moves to her cd player thumbs through a stack of cds and selects one k
the speakers blast out a high energy country number which mia plays air guitar to
she dances her way around the room and finds herself by vincents overcoat hanging on the rack
she touches its sleeve
it feels good
her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch
like a little girl playing cowboy she spreads the tobacco on some rolling paper
imitating what he did earlier licks the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette
maybe a little too fat but not bad for a first try
mia thinks so anyway
her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out his zippo lighter
she slaps the lighter against her leg trying to light it fancy style like vince did
what do you know she did it
mias one happy clam
she triumphantly brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke lighting it up then loudly snaps the zippo closed
the mia made cigarette is brought up to her lips and she takes a long cool drag
her hand slides the zippo back in the overcoat pocket
but wait her fingers touch something else
those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder inside the madman that vincent bought earlier from lance
wearing a big smile mia brings the bag of heroin up to her face
like you would say bingo
vince you little cola nut youve been holding out on me
vincent stands at the sink washing his hands talking to himself in the mirror
one drink and leave
dont be rude but drink your drink quickly say goodbye walk out the door get in your car and go down the road
mia has the unbeknownst to her heroin cut up into big lines on her glass top coffee table
taking her trusty hundred dollar bill like a human dust buster she quickly snorts the fat line
her head jerks back
her hands go to her nose which feels like its on fucking fire something is terribly wrong
the rush hits
vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his dialogue with the mirror
its a moral test of yourself whether or not you can maintain loyalty
because when people are loyal to each other thats very meaningful
mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom but its like shes trying to crawl with the bones removed from her knees
blood begins to drip from mias nose
then her stomach gets into the act and she vomits
so youre gonna go out there drink your drink say goodnight ive had a very lovely evening go home and jack off
and thats all youre gonna do
now that hes given himself a little pep talk vincents ready for whatevers waiting for him on the other side of that door
so he goes through it
we follow behind vincent as he walks from the bathroom to the living room where he finds mia lying on the floor like a rag doll
shes twisted on her back
blood and puke are down her front
and her face is contorted
not out of the tightness of pain but just the opposite the muscles in her face are so relaxed she lies still with her mouth wide open
vincent moves like greased lightning to mias fallen body
bending down where she lays he puts his fingers on her neck to check her pulse
she slightly stirs
mia is aware of vincent over her speaking to her
sounding weird mia
what the hell happened
but shes unable to communicate mia makes a few lost mumbles but theyre not distinctive enough to be called words
vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story
to himself ill be a son of a bitch
to mia mia
what did you take
answer me honey what did you take
mia is incapable of answering
he slaps her face hard
vincent springs up and runs to his overcoat hanging on the rack
he goes through the pockets frantically
vincent makes a beeline to mia
yelling to mia okay honey were getting you on your feet
he reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms
were on our feet now and now were gonna talk out to the car
here we go watch us walk
we follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically unconscious mia through the house and out the front door
insert speedometer red needle on a hundred
vincent driving like a madman in a town without traffic laws speeds the car into turns and up and over hills
vincent one hand firmly on the wheel the other shifting like robocop both eyes staring straight ahead except when he glances over at mia
mia slack jawed expression mouth gaping posture of a bag of water
vincent takes a cellular phone out of his pocket
he punches a number
at this late hour lance has transformed from a bon vivant drug dealer to a bathrobe creature
he sits in a big comfy chair ratty blue gym pants a worn out but comfortable tee shirt that has written on it taft california and a moth ridden terry
in his hand is a bowl of capn crunch with crunch berries
in front of him on the coffee table is a jug of milk the box the capn crunch with crunch berries came out of and a hash pipe in an
on the big screen tv in front of the table is the three stooges and theyre getting married
on tv hold hands you love birds
the phone rings
lance puts down his cereal and makes his way to the phone
it rings again
jody his wife calls from the bedroom obviously woken up
the phones ringing
calling back i can hear it
i thought you told those fuckin assholes never to call this late
by the phone i told em and thats what im gonna tell this fuckin asshole right now
he answers the phone hello do you know how late it is
youre not supposed to be callin me this fuckin late
vincent is still driving like a stripe assed ape clutching the phone to his ear
we cut back and forth during the conversation
lance this is vincent im in big fuckin trouble man im on my way to your place
whoa hold you horses man whats the problem
you still got an adrenaline shot
dawning on him maybe
i need it man i got a chick shes fuckin doing on me

then bite the fuckin bullet take er to a hospital and call a lawyer
she aint my fuckin problem you fucked her up you deal with it are you talkin to me on a cellular phone
i dont know you who is this dont come here im hangin up
too late im already here
at that moment inside lances house we hear vincents malibu coming up the street
lance hangs up the phone goes to his curtains and yanks the cord
the curtains open with a whoosh in time to see vincents malibu driving up on his front lawn and crashing into his house
the window lance is looking out of shatters from the impact
what the hell was that
lance charges from the window out the door to his front lawn
vincent is already out of the car working on getting mia out
have you lost your mind
you crashed your car in my fuckin house
you talk about drug shit on a cellular fuckin phone if youre through havin your little hissy fit this chick is dyin get your needle and git it now
are you deaf
youre not bringin that fucked up bitch in my house
this fucked up bitch is marsellus wallaces wife
now if she fuckin croaks on me im a grease spot
but before he turns me into a bar soap im gonna be forced to tell im about how you coulda saved her life but instead you let her die on
your front lawn
we start in lances and jodys bedroom
jody in bed throws off the covers and stands up
shes wearing a long tee shirt with a picture of fred flintstone on it
we follow handheld behind her as she opens the door walking through the hall into the living room
its only one thirty in the goddamn mornin
what the fucks goin on out here
as she walks in the living room she sees vincent and lance standing over mia whos lying on the floor in the middle of the room
from here on in everything in this scene is frantic like a documentary in an emergency ward with the big difference here being nobody knows what the fuck theyre doing
lance looks up at jody
get that black box in the bedroom i have with the adrenaline shot
whats wrong with her
shes oding on us
well get her the hell outta here
in stereo get the fuckin shot
dont yell and me
she angrily turns and disappears into the bedroom looking for the shot
we move into the room with the two men
to lance you two are a match made in heaven
look just keep talkin to her okay
while shes gettin the shot i gotta get a medical book
what do you need a medical book for
to tell me how to do it
ive never given an adrenaline shot before
youve had that thing for six years and you never used it
i never had to use it
i dont go joypoppin with bubble gummers all of my friends can handle their highs
well then get it
i am if youll let me
im not fuckin stoppin you
stop talkin to me and start talkin to her
we follow lance as he runs out of the living room into a
with a bunch of junk in it
he frantically starts scanning the junk for the book hes looking for repeating the words come on endlessly
from off screen we hear hurry up man
were losin her
calling back im looking as fast as i can
lance continues his frenzied search
we hear jody in the living room now as she talks to vincent
whats he lookin for
i dunno some medical book
jody calls to lance
what are you lookin for
my black medical book
as he continues searching flipping and knocking over shit jody appears in the doorway
whatare you looking for
my black fuckin medical book
its like a text book they give to nurses
i never saw a medical book
trust me i have one
well if its that important why didnt you keep it with the shot
lance spins toward her
i dont know
stop bothering me
while youre lookin for it that girls gonna die on our carpet
youre never gonna find it in all this shit
for six months now ive been telling you to clean this room get your ass in here fuck the book
lance angrily knocks over a pile of shit and leaves the shot heading for the living room
vincent is bent over mia talking softly to her when lance reenters the room
quit fuckin around man and give her the shot
lance bends down by the black case brought in by jody
he opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection
while im doing this take her shirt off and find her heart
vince rips her blouse open
jody stumbles back in the room hanging back from the action
does it have to be exact
yeah it has to be exact
im giving her an injection in the heart so i gotta exactly hit her in the heart
well i dont know exactly where her heart is i think its here
vince points to mias right breast
lance glances over and nods
as lance readies the injection vincent looks up at jody
i need a big fat magic marker got one
i need a big fat magic marker any felt penll do but a magic marker would be great
jody runs to the desk opens the top drawer and in her enthusiasm she pulls the drawer out of the desk the contents of which bills papers pens spill to
the injection is ready
lance hands vincent the needle
its ready ill tell you what to do
youre gonna give her the shot
no youre gonna give her the shot
ive never does this before
ive never done this before either and i aint starting now
you brought er here that means you give her the shot
the day i bring an oding bitch to your place then i gotta give her the shot
jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle a big fat red magic marker in her hand
vincent grabs the magic marker out of jodys hand and makes a big red dot on mias body where her heart is
okay what do i do
well youre giving her an injection of adrenaline straight to her heart
but shes got a breast plate in front of her heart so you gotta pierce through that
so what you gotta do is bring the needle down in a stabbing motion
lance demonstrates a stabbing motion which looks like the shape killing its victims in halloween
i gotta stab her
if you want the needle to pierce through to her heart you gotta stab her hard
then once you do push down on the plunger
what happens after that
im curious about that myself
this aint a fuckin joke man
shes supposed to come out of it like snaps his fingers that
vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing motion
he looks down on mia
mia is fading fast
soon nothing will help her
vincents eyes narrow ready to do this
count to three
lance on this knees right beside vincent does not know what to expect
red dot on mias body
needle raised ready to strike
jodys face is alive with anticipation
needle in that air poised like a rattler ready to strike
the needle leaves frame thrusting down hard
vincent brings the needle down hard stabbing mia in the chest
mias head is jolted from the impact
the syringe plunger is pushed down pumping the adrenaline out through the needle
mias eyes pop wide open and she lets out a hellish cry of the banshee
she bolts up in a sitting position needle stuck in her chest screaming
vincent lance and jody who were in sitting positions in front of mia jump back scared to death
mias scream runs out
she slowly starts taking breaths of air
the other three now scooted halfway across the room shaken to their bones look to see if shes alright
if youre okay say something
mia still breathing not looking up at them says in a relatively normal voice
vincent and lance collapse on their backs exhausted and shaking from how close to death mia came
anybody want a beer
vincent is behind the wheel driving mia home
no one says anything both are still too shaken
the malibu pulls up to the front
mia gets out without saying a word still in a daze and begins walking down the walkway toward her front door
she turns around
vincents out of the car standing on the walkway a big distance between the two
what are your thoughts on how to handle this
well im of the opinion that marsellus can live his whole live and never ever hear of this incident
dont worry about it
if marsellus ever heard of this id be in as much trouble as you
i seriously doubt that
if you can keep a secret so can i
lets shake on it
the two walk toward each other holding out their hands to shake and shake they do
mums the word
mia lets go of vincents hand and silently makes the see no evil hear no evil and speak no evil sign with her hands
if youll excuse me i gotta go home and have a heart attack
vincent turns to leave
you still wanna hear my fox force five joke
vincent turns around
sure but i think im still a little too petrified to laugh
you wont laugh because its not funny
but if you still wanna hear it ill tell it
i cant wait
three tomatoes are walking down the street a poppa tomato a momma tomato and a little baby tomato
the baby tomato is lagging behind the poppa and momma tomato
the poppa tomato gets mad goes over to the momma tomato and stamps on him stamps on the ground and says catch up
they both smile but neither laugh
see ya round vince
mia turns and walks inside her house
after mia walks inside
vincent continues to look at where she was
he brings his hands to his lips and blows her a kiss
then exits frame leaving it empty
we hear his malibu start up and drive away
fade up on the cartoon speed racer
speed is giving a detailed description of all the features on his race car the mac which he does at the beginning of every episode
off screen we hear a womans voice
were in the living room of a modest two bedroom house in alhambra california in the year
butchs mother ish stands in the doorway leading into the living room
next to her is a man dressed in the uniform of an american air force officer
the camera is the perspective of a five year old boy
butch stop watching tv a second
we got a special visitor
now do you remember when i told you your daddy dies in a p
well this here is capt
he was in the p
camp with daddy
koons steps inside the room toward the little boy and bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boys eyeline
when koons speaks he speaks with a slight texas accent
hello little man
boy i sure heard a bunch about you
see i was a good friend of your daddys
we were in that hanoi pit of hell over five years together
hopefully youll never have to experience this yourself but when two men are in a situation like me and your daddy were for as long as we were you take
on certain responsibilities of the other
if it had been me who had not made it major coolidge would be talkin right now to my son jim
but the way it worked out is im talkin to you butch
i got somethin for ya
the captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket
this watch i got here was first purchased by your great granddaddy
it was bought during the first world war in a little general store in knoxville tennessee
it was bought by private doughboy ernie coolidge the day he set sail for paris
it was your great granddaddys war watch made by the first company to ever make wrist watches
you see up until then people just carried pocket watches
your great granddaddy wore that watch every day he was in the war
then when he had done his duty he went home to your great grandmother took the watch off his wrist and put it in an ol coffee can
and in that can it stayed til your grandfather dane coolidge was called upon by his country to go overseas and fight the germans once again
this time they called it world war two
your great granddaddy gave it to your granddad for good luck
unfortunately danes luck wasnt as good as his old mans
your granddad was a marine and he was killed with all the other marines at the battle of wake island
your granddad was facing death and he knew it
none of those boys had any illusions about ever leavin that island alive
so three days before the japanese took the island your year old grandfather asked a gunner on an air force transport named winocki a man he had never met before
in his life to deliver to his infant son who he had never seen in the flesh his gold watch
three days later your grandfather was dead
but winocki kept his word
after the war was over he paid a visit to your grandmother delivering to your infant father his dads gold watch
this watch was on your daddys wrist when he was shot down over hanoi
he was captured and put in a vietnamese prison camp
now he knew if the gooks ever saw the watch itd be confiscated
the way your daddy looked at it that watch was your birthright
and hed be damned if and slopeheads were gonna put their greasy yella hands on his boys birthright
so he hid it in the one place he knew he could hide somethin
five long years he wore this watch up his ass
then when he died of dysentery he gave me the watch
i hid with uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass for two years
then after seven years i was sent home to my family
and now little man i give the watch to you
koons hands the watch to butch
a little hand comes into frame to accept it
the year old butch coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia trunks shoes and gloves
he lies on a table catching a few zzzzzzs before his big fight
almost as soon as we cut to him he wakes up with a start
shaken by the bizarre memory he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove
his trainer klondike an older fireplug opens the door a little sticking his head in the room
pandemonium seems to be breaking out behind klondike in the hallway
its time butch
klondike steps inside closing the door on the wild mob outside
he goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook
butch hops off the table and without a word klondike helps him on with the robe which says on the back battling butch the two men head for the door
klondike opens the door for butch
as butch steps into the hallway the crowd goes apeshit
klondike closes the door behind him leaving us in the quiet empty locker room
we hear over the black and white title well dan that had to be the bloodiest and hands down the most brutal fight this city has ever seen
the sound of chaos in the b
a taxi is parked in a dark alley next to an auditorium
the sky is pissin down rain
we slowly dolly toward the parked car
the sound of the car radio can be heard coming from inside
coolidge was out of there faster than ive ever seen a victorious boxer vacate the ring
do you think he knew willis was dead
my guess would be yes richard
i could see from my position here the frenzy in his eyes give way to the realization of what he was doing
i think any man wouldve left the ring that fast
inside the taxi behind the wheel is a female cabbie named esmarelda villalobos
a young woman with spanish looks sits parked drinking a steaming hot cup of coffee out of a white styrofoam cup
the sportscasters continue their coverage
do you feel this ring death tragedy will have an effect on the world of boxing
oh dan a tragedy like this cant help but shake the world of boxing to its very foundation
but its of paramount importance that during the sad weeks ahead the eyes of the w
remain firmly fixed on the click esmarelda shuts off the radio
she takes a sip of coffee then hears a noise behind her in the alley
she sticks her head out of the car door to see a window about three stories high opens on the auditorium side of the alley
a gym bag is tossed out into a garbage dumpster below the window
then butch coolidge still dressed in boxing trunks shoes gloves and yellow robe leaps to the dumpster below
esmareldas reaction takes in the strangeness of this sight
gym bag in hand butch climbs out of the dumpster and runs to the taxi
before he climbs in he takes off his robe and throws it to the ground
butch soaking wet naked except for trunks shoes and gloves hops in the backseat slamming the door
esmarelda staring straight ahead talks to butch through the rearview mirror spanish accent are you the man i was supposed to pick up
if youre the cab i called im the guy youre supposed to pick up
the ignition key is twisted
the engine roars to life
the meter is flipped on
esmareldas bare foot stomps on the gas pedal
the cab whips out of the alley fish tailing on the wet pavement in front of the auditorium at a rapid pace
locker room door opens english dave fights his way through the pandemonium which is going on outside in the hall shutting the door on the madness
once inside english dave takes time to adjust his suit and tie
mia is standing by the door
she sees vincent with english dave
how you doin
i never thanked you for the dinner
in the room black boxer floyd ray willis lies on a table dead
his face looks like he went dunking for bees
his trainer is on his knees head on floyds chest crying over the body
the huge figure that is marsellus wallace stands at the table hand on the trainers shoulder lending emotional support
we still do not see marsellus clearly only that he is big
mia sits in a chair at the far end of the room
marsellus looks up sees english dave and walks over to him
im prepared to scour the earth for this motherfucker
if butch goes to indo china i want a nigger hidin in a bowl of rice ready to pop a cap in his ass
ill take care of it
butch gets one of his boxing gloves off
esmeralda watches in the rearview mirror
he tries to roll down one of the backseat windows but cant find the roll bar
hey how do i open the window back here
i have to do it
she presses a button and the back window moves down
butch tosses his boxing glove out the window then starts untying the other one
esmeralda cant keep quiet anymore
still working on the glove what
you were in that fight
the fight on the radio youre the fighter
as he tosses his other glove out the window
whatever gave you that idea
no cmon youre him i know youre him tell me youre him
drying himself with a gym towel im him
you killed the other boxing man
the radio said he was dead
he finished wiping himself down
to himself sorry bout that floyd
he tosses the towel out the window
silence as butch digs in his bag for a t shirt
what does it feel like
finds his shirt what does what feel like
killing a man
beating another man to death with your bare hands
butch pulls on his tee shirt
are you some kinda weirdo
no its a subject i have much interest in
you are the first person i ever met who has killed somebody
so what was it like to kill a man
tell ya what you give me one of them cigarettes ill give you an answer
esmarelda bounces in her seat with excitement
butch leans forward
esmarelda keeping her eyes on the road passes a cigarette back to him
he takes it
then still not looking behind her she brings up her hand a lit match in it
butch lights his smoke then blows out the match
he takes a long drag
he looks at her license
esmarelda villalobos is that mexican
the name is spanish but im columbian
its a very pretty name
it mean esmarelda of the wolves
thats one hell of a name you got there sister
and what is your name
what does it mean

anyway moving right along what is it you wanna know esmarelda
i want to know what it feels like to kill a man i couldnt tell ya
i didnt know he was dead til you told me he was dead
now i know hes dead do you wanna know how i feel about it
esmarelda nods her head yes
i dont feel the least little bit bad
we dolly around a phone booth as butch talks inside
into phone whatd i tell ya soon as the word got out a fix was in the odds would be outta control
hey if he was a better fighter hes be alive
if he never laced up his gloves in the first place which he never shoulda done hed be alive

pause so by tomorrow evening youll have it all
pause good news scotty real good news i understand a few stragglers aside
me an fabiennere gonna leave in the morning
it should take us a couple days to get into knoxville
next time we see each other itll be on tennessee time
butch hangs up the phone
he looks at the cab waiting to take him wherever he wants to go
to himself in french with english subtitles fabienne my love our adventure begins
esmeraldas taxi pulled into the motel parking lot
the rain has stopped but the night is still soaked
butch gets out now fully dressed in tee shirt jeans and high school athletic jacket
he leans in the drivers side window
forty five sixty
handing her the money
and heres a little something for the effort
butch holds up a hundred dollar bill
esmareldas eyes light up
she goes to take it
butch holds it out of reach
now if anybody should ask you about who your fare was tonight whatre you gonna tell em
three well dressed slightly toasted mexicans
he gives her the bill
bon soir esmarelda
in spanish sleep well butch
he tweaks her nose she smiles and he turns and walks away
she drives off
butch enters and turns on the light
lying curled up on the bed fully dressed with her back to us is butchs french girlfriend fabienne
keep the light off
butch flicks the switch back making the room dark again
is that better sugar pop
hard day at the office
i got into a fight
can we make spoons
butch climbs into bed spooning fabienne from behind
when butch and fabienne speak to each other they speak in babytalk
i was looking at myself in the mirror
i wish i had a pot
you were lookin in the mirror and you wish you had some pot
a pot belly
pot bellies are sexy
well you should be happy cause you do
shut up fatso
i dont have a pot
i have a bit of a tummy like madonna when she did lucky star its not the same thing
i didnt realize there was a difference between a tummy and a pot belly
the difference is huge
you want me to have a pot
pot bellies make a man look either oafish or like a gorilla
but on a woman a pot belly is very sexy
the rest of you is normal
normal face normal legs normal hips normal ass but with a big perfectly round pot belly
if i had one id wear a tee shirt two sizes too small to accentuate it
you think guys would find that attractive
i dont give a damn what men find attractive

fabienne lies her head back
butch continues to massage her crotch

butch kisses her on the mouth
will you kiss it
she nods her head yes
but you first
butchs head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral pleasure
fabiennes face is alone in the frame
in french with english subtitles butch my love the adventure begins
same motel room except empty
we hear the shower running in the bathroom
the camera moves to the bathroom doorway
we see fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow her up
shes drying her head with a towel
butch is inside the shower washing up
we see the outline of his naked body through the smoky glass of the shower door
steam fills the bathroom
butch turns the shower off and opens the door popping his head out
i think i cracked a rib
giving me oral pleasure
no retard from the fight
dont call me retard
in a mongoloid voice my name is fabby
my name is fabby

she finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban on her head
i didnt call you a mongoloid i called you a retard but i took it back
she hands him a towel
drying his head yes lemon pie

butch exits the bathroom
we stay on fabienne as she brushes her teeth
butch keeps on from the other room
que hora es
que hora es
what time is it
what time is it
time for bed
sweet dream jellybean
fabienne brushes her teeth
we watch her for a moment or two then she remember something
she walks out of the bathroom to ask butch a question only to find him sound asleep in bed
she looks at him for a moment
she exits frame going back in the bathroom
we stay on the wide shot of the unconscious butch in bed
same shot as before the next morning
we find butch still asleep in bed
fabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the bathroom so she can watch tv at the same time
she still wears the terry cloth robe from the night before
on tv william smith and a bunch of hells angels are taking on the entire vietnamese army in the film the losers
butch wakes from his sleep as if a scary monster was chasing him
his start startles fabienne
you startled me
did you have a bad dream
butch squints down the front of the bed at her trying to focus
butch still trying to chase the cobwebs away sees on tv hells angels tear assin through a vietnamese prison camp
what are you watching
a motorcycle movie im not sure the name
are you watchin it
fabienne enters the room
in a way
would you like for me to switch it off
would you please
she reaches over and turns off the tv
its a little too early in the morning for explosions and war
what was it about
how should i know you were the one watchin it
no imbecile what was your dream about
its really rare i remember a dream
you just woke up from it
fabienne im not lying to you i dont remember

i couldnt understand you
she kisses butch
why dont you get up and well get some breakfast at that breakfast place with the pancakes
one more kiss and ill get up
fabienne gives butch a sweet long kiss
then get up lazy bones
butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of the suitcase that fabienne brought
what time is it
almost nine in the morning
what time does our train arrive
im gonna order a big plate of blueberry pancakes with maple syrup eggs over easy and five sausages
surprised at her potential appetite anything to drink with that
butch is finished dressing
referring to his clothes oh yes that looks nice
to drink a tall glass or orange juice and a black cup of coffee
after that im going to have a slice of pie
as he goes through the suitcase
pie for breakfast
any time of the day is a good time for pie
blueberry pie to go with the pancakes
and on top a thin slice of melted cheese wheres my watch
no its not
its not here
have you looked
by now butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase
yes ive fuckin looked
hes now throwing clothes
what the fuck do you think im doing
are you sure you got it
fabienne can hardly speak shes never seen butch this way
beside the table drawer on the little kangaroo
yes it was on your little kangaroo
well its not here
on the verge of tears well it should be
oh it most definitely should be here but its not
so where is it
fabienne is crying and scared
butch lowers his voice which only serves to make him more menacing
fabienne that was my fathers fuckin watch
you know what my father went through to git me that watch
i dont wanna get into it right now
but he went through a lot
now all this other shit you coulda set on fire but i specifically reminded you not to forget my fathers watch
now think did you get it
i believe so
you believe so
you either did or you didnt now which one is it
then i did
are you sure
butch freaks out he punches the air
fabienne screams and backs into a corner butch picks up the motel tv and throws it against the wall
fabienne screams in horror
butch looks toward her suddenly calm
to fabienne no
its not your fault
he approached her you left it at the apartment
he bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor
he touches her hand she flinches
if you did leave it at the apartment its not your fault
i had you bring a bunch of stuff
i reminded you about it but i didnt illustrate how personal the watch was to me
if all i gave a fuck about was my watch i shouldve told you
you aint a mind reader
he kisses her hand
fabienne is still sniffling
butch goes to the closet
butch puts on his high school jacket
it just means i wont be able to eat breakfast with you
why does it mean that
because im going back to my apartment to get my watch
wont the gangsters be looking for you there
thats what im gonna find out
if they are and i dont think i can handle it ill split
rising from the floor
i was so dreadful
i saw your watch i thought i brought it
im so sorry
butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face
dont feel bad sugar pop
nothing you could ever do would make me permanently angry at you
pause i love you remember
he digs some money out of his wallet now heres some money order those pancakes and have a great breakfast
ill be back before you can say blueberry pie
well maybe not that fast but fast
he kisses her once more and heads for the door
bye bye sugar pop
im gonna take your honda
and with that hes out the door
fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her
butch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his fists as he drives down the street
of all the fuckin things she coulda forgot she forgets my fathers watch
i specifically reminded her not to forget it
bedside table on the kangaroo
i said the words dont forget my fathers watch
the little honda races toward its destination as fast as is little engine will take it
a parking meter red flag rises up then out leaving the arrow pointing at one hour
butch isnt completely reckless
he has parked his car a couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before he goes boppin through the front door
butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street then he discreetly glances out
everything seems normal
more or less the right number of cars in the street
none of the parked cars appear out of place
none of them have a couple of goons sitting inside
basically it looks like normal morning activity in front of butchs home
butch peers around a wall taking in the vital information
butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything
he crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard
across the street from butchs building on the corner is a combination donut shop and japanese restaurant
a big sign sticks up in the air with the name teriyaki donut and a graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice
butch is in the courtyard of his north hollywood apartment building
once again everything appears normal the laundry room the pool his apartment door nothing appears disturbed
butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment number
he steps outside the door and listens inside
butch slowly inserts the key into the door quietly opening it
his apartment hasnt been touched
he cautiously steps inside shuts the door and takes a quick look around
obviously no one is there
butch walks into his modest kitchen and opens the refrigerator
he takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it
with carton in hard butch surveys the apartment
then he goes to the bedroom
his bedroom is like the rest of the apartment neat clean and anonymous
the only things personal in his room are a few boxing trophies an olympic silver medal a framed issue of ring magazine with butch on the cover and a poster
of jerry quarry and one of george chuvalo
sure enough theres the watch just like he said it was on the bedside table hanging on his little kangaroo statue
he walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen
he opens a cupboard and takes out a box of pop tarts
putting down the milk he opens the box takes out two pop tarts and puts them in the toaster
butch glances to his right his eyes fall on something
what he sees is a small compact czech m submachine gun with a huge silencer on it lying on his kitchen counter
softly holy shit
he picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines it
a toilet flushes
butch looks up to the bathroom door which is parallel to the kitchen
there is someone behind it
like a rabbit caught in a radish patch butch freezes not knowing what to do
the bathroom door opens and vincent vega steps out of the bathroom tightening his belt
in his hand is the book modesty blaise by peter odonnell
vincent and butch lock eyes
butch doesnt move except to point the m in vincents direction
neither man opens his mouth
the toaster loudly kicks up the pop tarts
thats all the situation needed
butchs finger hits the trigger
muffled fire shoots out of the end of the gun
vincent is seemingly wracked with twenty bullets simultaneously lifting him off his feet propelling him through the air and crashing through the glass shower door at the end of the
by the time butch removes his finger from the trigger vincent is annihilated
butch stands frozen amazed at what just happened
his look goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once vincent down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip
with the respect it deserves butch carefully places the m back on the kitchen counter
then he exits the apartment quickly
butch not running but walking very rapidly crosses the courtyard
comes out of the apartment building crosses the street
goes through the alley
and into his car in one steadicam shot
butch cranks the car into gear and drives away
the big wide smile of a survivor breaks across his face
the honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his apartment building
butch looks out the window at his former home
thats how youre gonna beat em butch
they keep underestimatin ya
this makes the boxer laugh out loud
as he laughs he flips a tape in the cassette player
when the music starts he sings along with it
he drives by the apartment but is stopped at the light on the corner across from teriyaki donut
butch is still chuckling singing along with the song as we see the big man himself marsellus wallace exit teriyaki donut carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two
large styrofoam cups of coffee
he steps off the curb crossing the street in front of butchs car
this is the first time we see marsellus clearly
laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front of him
when marsellus is in front of butchs car he casually glances to his left sees butch continues walking
double take am i really seeing what im seeing
butch doesnt wait for the big man to answer his own question
he stomps on the gas pedal
the little honda slams into marsellus sending him the donuts and the coffee hitting the pavement at thirty miles an hour
butch cuts into cross traffic and is broad sided by a gold camaro z breaking all the windows in the honda and sending it up on the sidewalk
butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what at one time was fabiennes honda
blood flows from his nostrils
the still functional tape player continues to play
a pedestrian pokes his head inside
jesus are you okay
butch look at him spaced out
marsellus wallace lies sprawled out in the street
gawkers gather around the body
to the others hes dead
this jerks yelling makes marsellus come to
two pedestrians help the shaken butch out of the wreckage
the woozy marsellus gets to his feet
if you need a witness in court ill be glad to help
he was a drunken maniac
he hit you and crashed into that car
still incoherent who
pointing at butch him
marsellus follows the gawkers finger and sees butch coolidge down the street looking a shambles
well ill be damned
the big man takes out a
automatic and the gawkers back away
marsellus starts moving toward butch
butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee line toward him
marsellus brings up his weapon and fires but hes so hurt shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild
he hits a looky loo woman in the hip
she falls to the ground screaming
oh my god ive been shot
thats all butch needs to see
hes outta here
marsellus runs after him
the crowd looks agape
butch is in a mad limping run
the big mans hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run
butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a sign that reads mason dixie pawnshop
maynard a hillbilly lookin boy stands behind the counter of his pawnshop when all of a sudden chaos in the form of butch races into his world
can i help you wit somethin
butch quickly takes measure of the situation than stands next to the door
now you just wait one goddamn minute before maynard can finish his threat marsellus charges in
he doesnt get past the doorway because butch lands his fist in marsellus face
the gangsters feet go out from under him and the big man falls flat on his back
outside two police cars with their sirens blaring race by
butch pounces on the fallen body punching him twice more in the face
butch takes the gun out of marsellus hand than grabs ahold of his middle finger
so you like chasing people huh
he breaks the finger
marsellus lets out a pain sound
butch then places the barrel of the
between his eyes pulls back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to shield the splatter
well guess what big man you caught me hold it right there godammit
butch and marsellus look up at maynard whos brandishing a pumpaction shotgun aimed at the two men
look mister this aint any of your business im makin it my business
now toss that gun
now you on top stand up and come to the counter
butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter
as soon as he gets there maynard hauls off hitting him hard in the face with the butt of the shotgun knocking butch down and out
after butch goes down maynard calmly lays the shotgun on the counter and moves to the telephone
marsellus wallace from his position on the floor groggily watches the pawnshop owner dial a number
maynard waits on the line while the other end rings
then it picks up
the spider just caught a coupla flies
marsellus passes out
they are tied up in two separate chairs
in their mouths are two s m style ball gags a belt goes around their heads and a little red ball sticks in their mouths
both men are unconscious
maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and sprays both guys until theyre wide awake and wet as otters
the two prisoners look up at their captors
maynard stands in front of them fire extinguisher in one hand shotgun in the other and marsellus
sticking in his belt
nobody kills anybody in my place of business except me or zed
a buzzer buzzes
without saying another word maynard climbs up the stairs that lead to red curtains and goes through them
we hear on the other side of the curtains maynard let zed inside the store
butch and marsellus look around the room
the basement of the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon
after taking in their predicament butch and marsellus look at each other all traces of hostility gone replaced by a terror they both share at what theyve gotten themselves into
maynard and zed come through the curtains
zed is an even more intense version of maynard if such a thing is possible
the two hillbillys are obviously brothers
where maynard is a vicious pitbull zed is a deadly cobra
zed walks in and stands in front of the two captives
he inspects them for a long time then says to maynard you said you waited for me
then how come theyre all beat up
they did that to each other
they was fightin when they came in
this one was gonna shoot that one
to butch you were gonna shoot him
butch makes no reply
hey is grace gonna be okay in front of this place
yeah it aint tuesday is it
no its thursday
then shell be fine
bring out the gimp
i think the gimps sleepin
well i guess youll just wake em up then wont you
maynard opens a trap door in the floor
yelling in the hole wake up
maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a leash
he gives it a rough yank and from below the floor rises the gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black leather bondage gear
there are zippers buckles and studs here and there on the body
on his head is a black leather mask with two eye holes and a zipper closed for a mouth
they keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large dog
zed takes the chair sits it in front of the two prisoners then lowers into it
maynard hands the gimps leash to zed then backs away
to the gimp down
the gimp gets on its knees
maynard hangs back while zed appraises the two men
i aint fer sure yet
then with his little finger zed does a silent eenie meany miney moe
just his mouth mouthing the words and his finger going back and forth between the two
butch are marsellus are terrified
maynard looks back and forth at the victims
the gimpss eyes go from one to the other inside the mask
zed continues his silent sing song with his finger moving left to right then it stops
after a beat the camera moves to the right zeroing in on marsellus
zed stands up
wanna do it here
naw drag big boy to russells old room
zed grabs marsellus chair and drags him into russells old room
russell no doubt was some other poor bastard that has the misfortune of stumbling into the mason dixie pawnshop
whatever happened to russell is known only to maynard and zed because his old room a back room in the back of the back room is empty
as marsellus is dragged away he locks eyes with butch before he disappears behind the door of russells old room
to the gimp up
the gimp rises
maynard ties the gimps leash to a hook on the ceiling
keep an eye on this one
the gimp bows its head yes
maynard disappears into russells old room
there must be a stereo in there because suddenly the judds singing in harmony fills the air
butch looks at the gimp
the gimp giggles from underneath the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history of comedy
from behind the door we hear country music struggling and whoa this boys got a bit of fight in em
we the hear maynard and zed beat on marsellus
you wanna fight
you wanna fight
good i like to fight
butch pauses listens to the voices
then in a panic hurriedly struggles to get free
the gimp is laughing wildly
the ropes are on too tight and butch cant break free
the gimp slaps his knee laughing in the back room we hear thats it
thats it boy youre goin fine
oooooooh just like that
grunting faster stay still
stay still goddamn ya
zed goddammit git over here and hold em
butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms
then quite easily the padded chair back slides up and off as if it were never connected by a bolt
the gimp sees this and its eyes widen
the gimp flails wildly trying to get the leash off the hook
he tries to yell but all that comes out are excited gurgles and grunts
butch is out of his chair quickly dispensing three boxers punches to its face
the punches knock the gimp out making him fall to his knees this hanging himself by the leash attached to the hook butch removes the ball gag then silently makes
his way through the red curtains
butch sneaks to the door
on the counter is a big set of keys with a large z connected to the ring
grabbing them hes about to go out when he stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their way with marsellus
butch decides for the life of him he cant leave anybody in a situation like that
se he begins rooting around the pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies heads in with
he picks up a big destructive looking hammer then discards it not destructive enough
he picks up a chainsaw thinks about it for a moment then puts it back
next a large louisville slugger he tries on for size
but then he spots what hes been looking for a samurai sword
it hands in its hand carved wood sheath from a nail on the wall next to a neon dads old fashioned root beer sign
butch takes the sword off the wall removing it from its sheath
its a magnificent piece of steel
it seems to glisten in the low wattage light of the pawnshop
butch touches his thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show
not on your life
its as sharp as it gets
this weapon seems made to order for the brothers grimm downstairs
holding the sword pointed downward takakura kenstyle he disappears through the red curtains to take care of business
butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon
sodomy and the judds can still be heard going string behind the closed door that leads to russells old room
butchs hand comes into frame pushing the door open
it swings open silently revealing the rapists who have switched positions
zed is now bent over marsellus who is bent over a wooden horse
both have their backs to butch
maynard faces the camera grinning while butch comes up behind him with the sword
miserable violated and looking like a rag doll marsellus red ball gag still in mouth opens his watery eyes to see butch coming up behind maynard
his eyes widen
maynard turns and sees butch holding the sword
with one mighty swing slashes maynard across the front moving past him eyes and blade now locked on zed
maynard stands trembling his front sliced open in shock
butch while never taking his eyes off zed thrusts the sword behind him skewering maynard then extracts it pointing the blade toward zed
zed disengages from marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go from the tip of butchs sword to marsellus
automatic which lies within reach
butchs eyes follow zeds
you want that gun zed
pick it up
zeds hand inches toward the weapon
butch grips the sword tighter
zed studies butch
butch looks hard at zed
then a voice says step aside butch
butch steps aside revealing marsellus standing behind him holding maynards pump action shotgun
zed is blasted in the groin
down he goes screaming in agony
marsellus looking down at his whimpering rapist ejects the used shotgun shell
butch lowers the sword and hangs back
not a word until you okay
im pretty fuckin far from okay
well let me tell you what now
im gonna call a couple pipe hittin niggers wholl go to work on homes here with a pair of pliers and a blow torch
to zed hear me talkin hillbilly boy

this shits between me and you and the soon to be livin the rest of his short ass life in agonizing pain mr
it aint nobody elses business
two leave town
and when youre gone stay gone
youve lost your los angeles privileges
the two men shake hands then hug one another
go on now get your ass outta here
butch leaves russells old room through the red curtains
marsellus walks over to a phone dialing a number
into the phone hello mr
wolf its marsellus
gotta bit of a situation
butch still shaking in his boots exits the pawnshop
he looks ahead and sees parked in front of the establishment zeds big chrome chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has the name grace on it
he climbs aboard takes out the keys with the big z on them and starts up the huge hog
it rumbles to life making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit
butch twists the accelerator handle and speeds off
fabienne stands in front of a mirror wearing a frankie says relax tee shirt singing along with music coming from a butch drives down the street humping a hot hog
he checks his fathers watch
the song in the motel room plays over this
butch rides up on grace
he hops off and runs inside the motel room while we stay outside with the bike
butch i was so worried
honey grab your radio and your purse and lets go
but what about all our bags
fuck the bags
well miss our train if we dont split now
is everything well
are we in danger
in fact were super cool
but we gots to go
ill wait for you outside
butch runs out and hops back on the bike
fabienne exits the motel room with the boom box and a large purse
when she sees butch on the chopper she stops dead
where did you get this motorcycle
he kick starts it its a chopper baby hop on
fabienne slowly approaches the two wheel demon
what happened to my honda
sorry baby i crashed the honda
i mightve broke my nose no biggie
she doesnt move
butch looks at her
honey we gotta hit the fuckin road
fabienne starts to cry
butch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the bike
he turns off the engine and reaches out taking her hand
im sorry baby love
crying you were gone so long i started to think dreadful thoughts
im sorry i worried you sweetie
hey how was breakfast
waterworks drying a little it was good did you get the blueberry pancakes
no they didnt have blueberry pancakes i had to get buttermilk are you sure youre okay
baby love from the moment i left you this has been without a doubt the single weirdest day of my entire life
climb on an ill tell ya about it
fabienne does climb on
butch starts her up
butch whose motorcycle is this
its a chopper
whose chopper is this
zeds dead baby zeds dead
and with that the two lovebirds peel away on grace as the song on the boom box rises
over black we can hear in the distance men talking
you ever read the bible brett
theres a passage i got memorized seems appropriate for this situation ezekiel
the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men
were in the bathroom of the hollywood apartment we were in earlier
in fact were there at exactly the same time
except this time were in the bathroom with the fourth man
the fourth man is pacing around the small room listening hard to whats being said on the other side of the door tightly clutching his huge silver
blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherded the weak through the valley of darkness
and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers
and you will know i am the lord when i lay my vengeance upon you
the fourth man freaks out
he throws himself against the back wall gun outstretched in front of him a look of yellow fear on his face ready to blow in half anybody fool enough to
stick their head through that door
then he listens to them talk
friend of yours
yeah marvin vincent vincent marvin
waiting for them isnt the smartest move
bursting out the door and blowing them all away while theyre fuckin around is the way to go
the bathroom door bursts open and the fourth man charges out silver magnum raised firing six booming shots from his hand cannon
dolly into fourth man same as before
he scream until hes dry firing
then a look of confusion crosses his face
standing next to each other unharmed
amazing as it seems none of the fourth mans shots appear to have hit anybody
jules and vincent exchange looks like are we hit
theyre as confused at the shooter
after looking at each other they bring their looks up to the fourth man
i dont understand the fourth man is taken out of the scenario by the two mens bullets who unlike his hit their marks
he drops dead
the two men lower their guns
jules obviously shaken sits down in a chair
vincent after a moment of respect shrugs it off
then heads toward marvin in the corner
why the fuck didnt you tell us about that guy in the bathroom
slip your mind
forget he was in there with a goddamn hand cannon
to himself we should be fuckin dead right now
pause did you see that gun he fired at us
it was bigger than him
we should be fuckin dead
yeah we were lucky
jules rises moving toward vincent
that shit wasnt luck
that shit was somethin else
vincent prepares to leave
you know what divine intervention is
yeah i think so
that means god came down from heaven and stopped the bullets
yeah man thats what is means
thats exactly what it means
god came down from heaven and stopped the bullets
i think we should be going now
dont do that
dont you fuckin do that
dont blow this shit off
what just happened was a fuckin miracle
chill the fuck out jules this shit happens
wrong wrong this shit doesnt just happen
do you wanna continue this theological discussion in the car or at the jailhouse with the cops
we should be fuckin dead now my friend
we just witnessed a miracle and i want you to fuckin acknowledge it
okay man it was a miracle can we leave now
the chevy nova propels itself into traffic
jules is behind the wheel vincent in the passenger seat and marvin in the back
ever seen that show cops
i was watchin it once and this cop was on it who was talkin about this time he got into this gun fight with a guy in a hallway
he unloads on this guy and he doesnt hit anything
and these guys were in a hallway
its a freak but it happens
if you wanna play blind man then go walk with a shepherd
but me my eyes are wide fuckin open
what the fuck does that mean
thats it for me
for here on in you can consider my ass retired
goddammit jules i said dont do that youre fuckin freakin out
im tellin marsellus today im through
while youre at it be sure to tell im why
dont worry i will
ill bet ya ten thousand dollars he laughs his ass off
i dont give a damn if he does
vincent turns to the backseat with the
casually in his grip
marvin what do you make of all this
i dont even have an opinion
do you think god came down from heaven and stopped the bullets

we gotta be real fuckin delicate with this jimmies situation
hes one remark away from kickin our asses out the door
if he kicks us out whadda we do
well we aint leavin til we made a couple phone calls

he kinda freaked out back there when he saw marvin
put yourself in his position
its eight oclock in the morning
he just woke up he wasnt prepared for this shit
dont forget whos doin who a favor
vincent finishes then dries his hands on a white towel
if the price of that favor is i gotta take shit he can stick his favor straight up his ass
when vincent is finished drying his hands the towel is stained with red
what the fuck did you just do to his towel
i was just dryin my hands
youre supposed to wash em first

three men are standing in jimmies kitchen each with a mug of coffee
jules vincent and jimmie dimmick a young man in his late s dressed in a bathrobe
goddamn jimmie this is some serious gourmet shit
me an vincent woulda been satisfied with freeze dried tasters choice

jules starts to jimmie him answer to question

well say she comes home

pause no fuckin shit shell freak

how bad a lot or a little
jules paces around in jimmies bedroom on the phone
you got to appreciate what an explosive element this bonnie situation is
if she comes home from a hard days work and finds a bunch of gangsters doin a bunch of gangsta shit in her kitchen aint no tellin what shes apt
ive grasped that jules
all im doin is contemplating the ifs

you aint got no problems jules

shit negro thats all you had to say
the camera looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite into the main area
we see a crap game being played on a fancy crap table by gamblers in tuxedos and lucky ladies in fancy evening gowns
the camera pans to the right revealing sitting on a bed phone in hand with his back to us the tuxedo clad winston wolf aka the wolf
we also see the wolf has a small notepad that he jots details in
into phone is she the hysterical type
pause when she due
jotting down give me the principals names again
jots down jules
we see his book
the page has written on it riverside drive toluca lake body no head bloody shot up car jules black vincent
vincent dean martin jimmie house bonnie expect a call around
its about thirty minutes away
ill be there in ten
he hangs up
we never see his face
a silver porsche whips the corner leading to jimmies home in hyper drive
easily doing mph the porsche stops on a dime in front of jimmies house
a ringed finger touches the doorbell ding dong
jimmie opens the door
we see standing in the doorway the tuxedo clad man
he looks down to his notebook then up at jimmie
youre jimmie right
this is your house
stick his hand out im winston wolf i solve problems
good cause we got one
so i heard
may i come in
in the dining room jules and vincent stand up
you must be jules which would make you vincent
lets get down to brass tacks gentlemen
if i was informed correctly the clock is ticking is that right jimmie
your wife bonnie
refers to his pad comes home at in the am is that correct
i was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here she wouldnt appreciate it none too much
she wont at that
that gives us forty minutes to get the fuck outta dodge which if you do what i say when i say it should by plenty
now you got a corpse in a car minus a head in a garage
take me to it
the three men hang back as the wolf examines the car
he studies the car in silence opening the door looking inside circling it
do me a favor will ya
thought i smelled some coffee in there
would you make me a cup
sure how do you take it
lotsa cream lotsa sugar
the wolf continues his examination
about the car is there anything i need to know
does it stall does it make a lot of noise does it smoke is there gas in it anything
aside from how it looks the cars cool
dont get me out on the road and i find out the brake lights dont work
hey man as far as i know the motherfuckers tip top
good enough lets go back to the kitchen
jimmie hands the wolf a cup of coffee
thank you jimmie
he takes a sip then pacing as he thinks lays out for the three men the plan of action
okay first thing you two
meaning jules and vincent take the body stick it in the trunk
now jimmie this looks to be a pretty domesticated house
that would lead me to believe that in the garage or under the sink you got a bunch of cleansers and cleaners and shit like that am i correct
under the sink
what i need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products and clean the inside of the car
and im talkin fast fast fast
you need to go in the backseat scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull
get it out of there
wipe down the upholstery now when it comes to upholstery it dont need to be spic and span you dont need to eat off it
give it a good once over
what you need to take care of are the really messy parts
the pools of blood that have collected you gotta soak that shit up
but the windows are a different story
them you really clean
get the windex do a good job
now jimmie we need to raid your linen closet
i need blankets i need comforters i need quilts i need bedspreads
the thicker the better the darker the better
no whites cant use em
we need to camouflage the interior of the car
were gonna line the front seat and the backseat and the floor boards with quilts and blankets
if a cop stops us and starts stickin his big snout in the car the subterfuge wont last
but at a glance the car will appear to be normal
jimmie lead the way boys get to work
the wolf and jimmie turn heading for the bedroom leaving vincent and jules standing in the kitchen
calling after him a please would be nice
the wolf stops and turns around
i said a please would be nice
the wolf takes a step toward him
set is straight buster
im not here to say please
im here to tell you want to do
and if self preservation is an instinct you possess you better fuckin do it and do it quick
im here to help
if my helps not appreciated lotsa luck gentlemen
it aint that way mr
your help is definitely appreciated
i dont mean any disrespect
i just dont like people barkin orders at me
if im curt with you its because time is a factor
i think fast i talk fast and i need you guys to act fast if you want to get out of this
so pretty please with sugar on top clean the fuckin car
jimmies gathering all the bedspreads quilts and linen he has
the wolf is on the phone
into phone its a chevy nova
pause nothin except for the mess inside
pause about twenty minutes
pause nobody wholl be missed
pause youre a good man joe

he looks at jimmie how we comin jimmie
jimmie comes over with a handful of linen
wolf you gotta understand somethin winston jimmie please winston

it was a wedding present from my uncle conrad and aunt ginny and they aint with us anymore let me ask you a question if you dont mind
were you uncle conrad and aunt ginny millionaires

takes out a roll of bills i like oak myself thats whats in my bedroom
how bout you jimmie you an oak man
both jules and vincent are inside the car cleaning it up
vincent is in the front seat washing windows while jules is in the backseat picking up little pieces of skull and gobs of brain
both are twice as bloody as they were before
i will never forgive your ass for this shit
this is some fucked up repugnant shit
did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits hes wrong hes immediately forgiven for all wrong doings
man get outta my face with that shit
the motherfucker who said that never had to pick up itty bitty pieces of skull with his fingers on account of your dumb ass
i got a threshold jules
i got a threshold for the abuse ill take

t im the guns of navarone
im what jimmie walker usta talk about
in fact what the fuck am i doin in the back
youre the motherfucker should be on brain detail
im washin windows and youre pickin up this niggers skull
the interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with bedspreads and quilts
believe it or not what looked like a portable slaughterhouse can actually pass for a non descript vehicle
the wolf circles the car examining it
jules and vincent stand aside their clothes are literally a bloody mess but they do have a sense of pride in what a good job theyve done
fine job gentlemen
we may get out of this yet
i cant believe thats the same car
well lets not start suckin each others dicks quite yet
phase one is complete clean the car which moves us right along to phase two clean you two
jules and vincent stand side by side in their black suits covered in blood in jimmies backyard
jimmie holds a plastic hefty trash bag while the wolf holds a garden hose with one of those guns nozzles attached
all the way
to your bare ass
as they follow directions the wolf enjoys a smoke
quickly gentlemen we got about fifteen minutes before jimmies better half comes pulling into the driveway
this morning air is some chilly shit
are you sure this is absolutely necessary
you know what you two look like
like a couple of guys who just blew off somebodys head
yes strippin off those bloody rags is absolutely necessary
toss the clothes in jims garbage bag
now jimmie dont do nothin stupid like puttin that out in front of your house for elmo the garbage man to take away
dont worry were takin it with us
jim the soap
he hands the now naked men a bar of soap
okay gentlemen youre both been to county before im sure
here it comes
he hits the trigger water shoots out smacking both men
goddamn that waters fuckin cold
better you than me gentlemen
the two men trembling scrub themselves
dont be afraid of the soap spread it around
the wolf stops the hose tossing it on the ground
jimmie tosses them each a towel which they rub furiously across their bodies
youre dry enough give em their clothes
jules and vincent in their tee shirts and swim trunks
they look a million miles away from the black suited bad asses we first met
we couldntve planned this better
you guys look like
what do they look like jimmie
they look like a couple of dorks
the wolf and jimmie laugh
ha ha ha
theyre your clothes motherfucker
i guess you just gotta know how to wear them
yeah well our asses aint the expert on wearin dorky shit that your is
cmon gentlemen were laughin and jokin our way into prison
dont make me beg
the garbage bag is tossed in the car trunk on top of marvin
the wolf slams is closed
gentlemen lets get our rules of the road straight
were going to a place called monster joes truck and tow
monster joe and his daughter raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma
the place is north hollywood so a few twist and turns aside well be goin up hollywood way
now ill drive the tainted car
jules you ride with me
vincent you follow in my porsche
now if we cross the path of any john q
laws nobody does a fuckin thing til i do something
what did i say
dont do shit unless unless what
unless you do it first
spoken like a true prodigy
to vincent how bout you lash larue
can you keep your spurs from jingling and jangling
im cool mr
my gun just went off i dunno how
he throws vince his car keys i drive real fuckin fast so keep up
if i get my car back any different than i gave it monster joes gonna be disposing of two bodies
jules and vincent wait by winstons porsche
like it never happened
jules and vincent bump fists
boys this is raquel
someday all this will be hers
to the boys hi
you know if they ever do i spy the motion picture you guys id be great
whats with the outfits
you guys going to a volleyball game
winston laughs the boys groan
im takin mlady out to breakfast
maybe i can drop you two off
where do you live
winston grabs jules wrist and pantomimes like hes in a dead zone trance
painfully its your future i see
a cab ride
dropping the act sorry guys move out of the sticks
to raquel say goodbye raquel
ill see you two around and stay outta trouble you crazy kids
winston turns to leave
he turns around
i was a pleasure watchin you work
the wolf smiles
call me winston
he turns and banters with raquel as they get in the porsche
you hear that young lady
you could lean a lot from those two fine specimens
respect for ones elders shows character
i have character
just because you are a character doesnt mean you have character
oh youre so funny oh youre so funny
the porsche shoots off down the road
the two men left alone look at each other
wanna share a cab
you know i could go for some breakfast
want to have breakfast with me
jules and vincent sit at a booth
in front of vincent is a big stack of pancakes and sausages which he eats with gusto
jules on the other hand just has a cup of coffee and a muffin
he seems far away in thought
the waitress pours a refill for both men thanks a bunch
to jules whos nursing his coffee want a sausage
naw i dont eat pork
are you jewish
i aint jewish man i just dont dig on swine
theyre filthy animals
i dont eat filthy animals
sausages taste good
pork chops taste good
a sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie
ill never know cause even if it did i wouldnt eat the filthy motherfucker
pigs sleep and root in shit
thats a filthy animal
i dont wanna eat nothin that aint got enough sense to disregard its own feces
how about dogs
dogs eat their own feces
i dont eat dog either
yes but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal
i wouldnt go so far as to call a dog filthy but theyre definitely dirty
but a dogs got personality
and personality goes a long way
so by that rationale if a pig had a better personality hes cease to be a filthy animal
wed have to be talkin bout one motherfuckin charmin pig
itd have to be the cary grant of pigs
the two men laugh
good for you
lighten up a little
you been sittin there all quiet
i just been sittin here thinkin
mouthful of food about what
the miracle we witnessed
the miracle you witnessed
i witnessed a freak occurrence
do you know that a miracle is
an act of god
whats an act of god
i guess its when god makes the impossible possible
and im sorry jules but i dont think what happened this morning qualifies
dont you see vince that shit dont matter
youre judging this thing the wrong way
its not about what
it could be god stopped the bullets he changed coke into pepsi he found my fuckin car keys
you dont judge shit like this based on merit
whether or not what we experienced was an according to hoyle miracle is insignificant
what is significant is i felt gods touch god got involved
thats whats fuckin wit me
i dont know why
but i cant go back to sleep
so youre serious youre really gonna quit
the life most definitely
vincent takes a bite of food
jules takes a sip of coffee in the b
we see a patron call the waitress
we recognize the patron to be pumpkin from the first scene of pumpkin and honey bunny
so if youre quitting the life whatll you do
thats what ive been sitting here contemplating
first im gonna deliver this case to marsellus
then basically im gonna walk the earth
what do you mean walk the earth
you know like caine in kung fu
just walk from town to town meet people get in adventures
how long do you intend to walk the earth
until god puts me where he want me to be
what if he never does
if it takes forever ill wait forever
so you decided to be a bum
ill just be jules vincent no more no less
no jules youre gonna be like those pieces of shit out there who beg for change
they walk around like a bunch of fuckin zombies they sleep in garbage bins they eat what i throw away and dogs piss on em
they got a word for em theyre called bums
and without a job residence or legal tender thats what youre gonna be a fuckin bum
look my friend this is just where me and you differ what happened was peculiar no doubt about it but it wasnt water into wine
all shapes and sizes vince
stop fuckin talkin like that
if you find my answers frightening vincent you should cease askin scary questions
i gotta take a shit
to be continued
vincent exits for the restroom
jules alone takes a mouthful of muffin then
pumpkin and honey bunny rise with guns raised
everybody be cool this is a robbery
any of you fuckin pricks move and ill execute every one of you motherfuckers
jules looks up not believing what hes seeing
under the table jules hand goes to his
he pulls it out cocking it
customers stay seated waitresses on the floor
now mean fuckin now
do it or die do it or fucking die
like lightning pumpkin moves over to the kitchen
while honey bunny screams out threats to the patrons keeping them terrified
you mexicans in the kitchen get out here
three cooks and two busboys come out of the kitchen
on the floor or ill cook you ass comprende
the portly manager speaks up
im the manager here theres no problem no problem at all pumpkin heads his way
youre gonna give me a problem
he reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the managers neck
you said youre gonna give me a problem
no im not
im not gonna give you any problem
i dont know honey bunny
he looks like the hero type to me
dont take any chances
the patrons scream
jules watches all this silently his hand tightly gripping the
automatic under the table
im not a hero
im just a coffee shop manager
take anything you want
tell everyone to cooperate and itll be all over
everybody just be calm and cooperate with them and this will be all over soon
well done now git your fuckin ass on the ground
vincent on the toilet oblivious to the pandemonium outside reads his modesty blaise book
cash register drawer opens
pumpkin stuffs the money from the till in his pocket
then walks from behind the counter with a trash bag in his hand
okay people im going to go round and collect your wallets
dont talk just toss em in the bag
pumpkin goes around collecting wallets
jules sits with his ready to spit under the table
pumpkin sees jules sitting in his booth holding his wallet briefcase next to him
pumpkin crosses to him his tone more respectful him manner more on guard
in the bag
jules drops his wallet in the bag
using his gun as a pointer pumpkin points to the briefcase
whats in that
my boss dirty laundry
you boss makes you do his laundry
when he wants it clean
sounds like a shit job
funny ive been thinkin the same thing
open it up
jules free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase
fraid i cant do that
pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer
he aims the gun right in the middle of jules face and pulls back the hammer
i didnt hear you
yes you did
this exchange has been kind of quiet not everybody heard it but honey bunny senses somethings wrong
whats goin on
looks like we got a vigilante in our midst
shoot em in the face
i dont mean to shatter your ego but this aint the first time ive had gun pointed at me
you dont open up that case its gonna be the last
on the ground quit causing problems youll get us all killed
give em what you got and get em out of here
keep your fuckin mouth closed fat man this aint any of your goddamn business
im countin to three and if your hand aint off that case im gonna unload right in your fuckin face
jules raises his hand off the briefcase
its all yours ringo
jules flips the locks and opens the case revealing it to pumpkin but not to us
the same light shines from the case
pumpkins expression goes to amazement
honey bunny across the room cant see shit
what is it
what is it
softly is that what i think it is
jules nods his head yes
jules nods his head yes
goddammit what is it
jules slams the case closed then sits back as if offering the case to pumpkin
pumpkin one big smile bends over to pick up the case
like a rattlesnake jules free hand grabs the wrist of pumpkins gun hand slamming it on the table
his other hand comes from under the table and sticks the barrel of his
hand under pumpkins chin
honey bunny freaks out waving her gun in jules direction
let him go
let him go
ill blow your fuckin head off
ill kill ya
ill kill ya
youre gonna die youre gonna fuckin die bad
to pumpkin tell that bitch to be cool
say bitch be cool
say bitch be cool
chill out honey
let him go
softly tell her its gonna be okay
im gonna be okay
tell her to chill

whats her name
whenever jules talks to yolanda he never looks at her only at pumpkin
to yolanda so we cool yolanda
we aint gonna do anything stupid are we
crying dont you hurt him
nobodys gonna hurt anybody
were gonna be like three fonzies
and what fonzie like
cmon yolanda whats fonzie like
through tears unsure hes cool
and thats what were gonna be were gonna be cool
to pumpkin now ringo im gonna count to three and i want you to let go your gun and lay your palms flat on the table
but when you do it do it cool
pumpkin looks at him
pumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table
yolanda cant stand it anymore
okay now let him go
yolanda i thought you were gonna be cool
when you yell at me it makes me nervous
when i get nervous i get scared
and when motherfuckers get scared thats when motherfuckers get accidentally shot
more conversational just know you hurt him you die
that seems to be the situation
now i dont want that and you dont want that and ringo here dont want that
so lets see what we can do
to ringo now this is the situation
normally both of your asses would be dead as fuckin fried chicken
but you happened to pull this shit while im in a transitional period
i dont wanna kill ya i want to help ya
but im afraid i cant give you the case
it dont belong to me
besides i went through too much shit this morning on account of this case to just hand it over to your ass
what the fucks goin on here
yolanda whips her gun toward the stranger
vincent by the bathroom has his gun out dead aimed at yolanda
its cool vincent
dont do a goddamn thing
yolanda its cool baby nothins changed
were still just talkin
to pumpkin tell her were still cool
its cool honey bunny were still cool
gun raised what the hells goin on jules
nothin i cant handle
i want you to just hang back and dont do shit unless its absolutely necessary
yolanda how we doin baby
i gotta go pee
i want to go home
just hang in there baby youre doing great ringos proud of you and so am i
its almost over
to pumpkin now i want you to go in that bag and find my wallet
which one is it
its the one that says bad motherfucker on it
pumpkin looks in the bag and sure enough theres a wallet with bad motherfucker embroidered on it
thats my bad motherfucker
now open it up and take out the cash
how much is there
about fifteen hundred dollars
put it in your pocket its yours
now with the rest of them wallets and the register that makes this a pretty successful little score
jules if you give this nimrod fifteen hundred buck im gonna shoot em on general principle
you aint gonna do a goddamn thing now hang back and shut the fuck up
besides i aint givin it to him
im buyin somethin for my money
wanna know what im buyin ringo
im givin you that money so i dont hafta kill your ass
you read the bible
theres a passage i got memorized
the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men
blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness
for he is truly his brothers keeper and the finder of lost children
and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers
and you will know i am the lord when i lay my vengeance upon you
i been sayin that shit for years
and if you ever heard it it meant your ass
i never really questioned what it meant
i thought it was just a coldblooded thing to say to a motherfucker fore you popped a cap in his ass
but i saw some shit this mornin made me think twice
now im thinkin it could mean youre the evil man
and im the righteous man
here hes the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness
or is could by youre the righteous man and im the shepherd and its the world thats evil and selfish
id like that
but that shit aint the truth
the truth is youre the weak
and im the tyranny of evil men
but im tryin
im tryin real hard to be a shepherd
jules lowers his gun lying it on the table
pumpkin looks at him to the money in his hand then to yolanda
she looks back
grabbing the trash bag full of wallets the two run out the door
jules who was never risen from his seat the whole time takes a sip of coffee
to himself its cold
he pushes it aside
vincent appears next to jules
i think we oughta leave now
thats probably a good idea
vincent throws some money on the table and jules grabs the briefcase
then to the amazement of the patrons the waitresses the cooks the bus boys and the manager these two bad ass dudes wearing uc santa cruz and im with stupid
tee shirts swim trunks thongs and packing
automatics walk out of the coffee shop together without saying a word
