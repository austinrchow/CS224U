written by brad mirman first draft march pitch dark
we hear two men speaking french in hushed voices
note all dialogue is in french until otherwise noted
whispering turn on the flashlight
it doesnt work
it has to work
you just bought it this afternoon
do they come with batteries
you didnt buy batteries
i thought they came with batteries
i cant believe you didnt check
i bought everything you put on the list
batteries were not on the list
why should i have to put it on the list
its like saying to buy a car with tires
a wealthy neighborhood of paris off the champs elysees
large homes line the secluded street
we see the silhouette of a man in a peugeot
we move in closer to see raymond gayet s waits nervously
daniel foray lights his zippo lighter
he is late s tall handsome with eyes that seem to twinkle in the glow of the flame
beside him is julien labesse s hyper
daniel places the lighter on a small table and moves over to a painting on the wall
daniel stops at one removes a pen knife and starts to cut the canvas from the frame
daniel rolls up the canvas
julien starts to pick up the zippo
be careful its
julien has already picked it up
it burns his hand ans he flicks it away
it flies through the air and lands in the corner of the room
the curtains catch on fire
he grabs the canvas out of daniels hand and begins beating the flames with it
daniel looks at him with disbelief
julien flails his arms wildly as he beats back the flames
he turns to daniel pleased that his efforts have extinguished the fire but unaware that the canvas has now caught on fire
julien sees the flames and puts them out
daniel just stares at him
he opens the canvas
the painting is ruined
a mercedes parks in front of the peugeot boxing it in between it and a car behind it
the driver gets out and walks away
daniel and julien move through the darkness
light your lighter
i cant see anything
and try not to burn down the house
julien remove a lighter and presses it
the entire room fills with light
julien stares at the flame amazed
they turn to see an old man standing at the top of the stairs in his bathrobe
he is frail his face pasty white
he is holding a very long double barrel shotgun
julien looks to daniel with a what now expression
the old man slowly moves down the stairs
he loses his balance and falls down the stairs tumbling head over heals until he reaches the bottom
daniel and julien stare at the old man who is sprawled out on the floor motionless
is he dead
i dont know
he looks dead
he looked dead before he fell
the old man groans then opens his eyes
he grabs his shotgun
daniel and julien run to the door
daniel and julien run towards the street
start the car
start the car
raymond starts the engine
daniel and julien rush across the street and get in the back seat
raymond tries to pull out but there are only a few inches between the mercedes in front and the car behind
like a pinball stuck between two bumpers the peugeot jerks rapidly back and forth
daniel and julien stare angrily ar raymond
you didnt think to move the car before we came out
daniel looks out his window and sees
daniels pov the old man runs out of his house with his shotgun and heads towards the car
raymond is desperately trying to get the car free
they all slide down as the old man fires
the windows on the left side of the car shatter
raymond get us out of here
raymond pops up and returns to getting the car out as the old man opens the breach of the shotgun to reload
raymond floors the peugeot keeping his foot on the brake
the engine revs
he turns the wheel to the left and releases the brake
the peugeot juts forward smashing into the rear of the mercedes and pushing in out into the street
before the old man can take aim the peugeot is speeding down the street
raymond bites his lip nervously as he drives
julien finds the whole thing amusing
daniel leans forward
to raymond you know what makes a good get away driver
daniel contd controlled anger being able to get away
youre always pointing out my negative qualities
my analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people
raymond wed like to commend you on how well you fucked up tonight
a narrow street
daniel carries the cardboard tube as he walks with julien and raymond
they enter a warehouse
two large desks are lined up face to face
one is empty
the other is occupied by laurant bastaldi s all business
off to the side is marcel burot s
daniel julien and raymond enter
as they approach the desk daniel glances at marcel who is staring at him
amused i heard you almost got your ass blown off last night
a regular black panther
marcel glances at bastaldi to see if he appreciates his comments
a black panther was a member of an african american militant group in the sixties marcel
i think youre referring to the pink panther
pink panther black panther
who gives a shit
and i dont remember asking you a god damn thing you little turd
theres no reason to be abusive
youre projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism
what the hell is he talking about
im talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly
how about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick
both of you
youre giving me a fuckin headache
raymond and marcel stare at one another
we hear a muffled groaning sound in the b
wheres your brother
vincents in the states on business
a beat referring to the painting that it
daniel lays the cardboard tube containing the painting on the desk
bastaldi removes the painting
to him it is not a work of art just a commodity to be sold
he opens his desk drawer removes several large stacks of money and hands them to daniel
now ive got something i want to we hear the groaning sound again
bastaldi looks irritated
he gets up and walks over to a closet
he opens to the doors to reveal a man in his underwear his wrists tied behind his back his mouth taped shut
a wire noose is around his neck forcing him to stand on his tip toes to avoid hanging himself
do you mind
im trying to do some business here
the man looks at bastaldi through pleading eyes and mumbles something
one more sound out of you and im going to cut your fuckin tongue out
bastaldi closes the door
daniel looks at him inquisitively
you take someone in
give them a steady job and how do they repay you
by claiming to misplace a shipment of your merchandise
maybe he did misplace it
you misplace your car keys
you misplace your cell phone
bastaldi contd you do not misplace one hundred and forty seven wide screen tvs
laurant how long has he been in there
bastaldi looks puzzled
i dont know
what day is today
is it thursday already
this week has just shot by
bastaldi thinks about something for a moment then
you and your crew speak english dont you
daniel is still staring at the closet
snaps his fingers do you guys speak english
i have a job for you in america
bastaldi tosses a photo of a middle aged american couple
he points to a diamond necklace around the womans neck
the taylors from chicago
an acquaintance of mine recently quit working for mrs
taylor as an assistant
she tells me they keep all their jewelry in a safe in their bedroom
it seems like a long way to go for a necklace
besides we dont know the city and overlapping mr
bastaldi isnt asking you if you want to go
marcel contd hes telling you youre going
and if hes telling you youre going to be going then you are going to go
thank you marcel for that
extremely redundant explanation
cmon laurant america
the job is worth about two million euros
pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money daniel
you leave tomorrow
they know they dont have a choice
were going to need to find someone who knows the city
i know someone
the plaza is filled with tourists
moving through the crowd is sami zerhouni algerian late s a small time street hustler dressed in jeans and a i love paris tee shirt
he passes a man who is about to take a picture and lifts his wallet
sami moves on
he sees two overweight women standing at a vendors cart holding a large wad of money
the woman puts the cash back in her purse but does not zip it up
sami moves in behind her and slips his hand into the purse
she zips the bag closed
samis face fills with pain as the zipper catches the hair of his arm
the women walk towards the cathedral
sami has no choice but follow after them
he tries to match their pace so he doesnt alert them of his presence
the woman looks back and sees samis hand
she pulls her bag away ripping a section of hair off his arm then swings the bag putting all of her weight behind it
it hits sami squarely in the face
he lands on his back with a thud
wallets and billfolds fly out from every one of his pockets
he staggers to his feet and starts to pick up the wallets when he sees
his pov across the plaza of two police officers moving towards him
he knows he has no more time
he takes off running disappearing into the crowd
sami is at the bar
he sees marcel enter and runs towards the back
standing in his way is one of marcels men
sami turns around as marcel approaches and forces a smile
note all dialogue is now in english unless otherwise noted
i thought you were somebody else
if i knew it was you i would have never run
a long awkward beat as marcel just glares at him
youre probably here for the money i owe you
off marcels nod i dont have it
marcel opens the door to the bathroom and pushes sami inside
marcel closes the door
he is face to face with sami
you know this is how rumors get started
marcel punches sami in the stomach
he drops to his knees
the door to the bathroom opens and the large man peers inside
he stares awkwardly at what he perceives as the beginning of a sexual act
marcel slams the door then grabs sami by the ear and yanks him to his feet
todays your lucky day sami
breathlessly yeah i can see that
normally id be breaking your fingers right now but im going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself
we have a group going to chicago to do a job
youre going with them
you lived there
you know the city
ive still got a few legal problems back in the states
marcel glares at him
nervously but id be
id be happy to go
marcel stares at him with hard expression
if you try to leave town ill know
if you manage to leave town ill find you
and the next time we meet in a bathroom ill be cutting you up into little pieces
he hands sami a piece of paper
be at this address at nine oclock tomorrow morning
daniel sits with julien
at the end of the bar raymond is on the pay phone
in french yes mama
yes i have my vitamins
i have everything
of course im coming back
im not leaving you
im only going to be gone a few days
ill call you when i get there
ive got to go now
listens mama ive got to go
listens no im not yelling
sami enters and walks over to daniel and julien
marcel sent me
what is it you do sami
you know a little of this a little of that
ive boosted cars stole radios run a few scams
right now im into pick pocketing
a master criminal
hey i was told to come here by marcel
you guys dont want me ill be more than happy to leave
the door opens
no one knows his last name
he is s blonde hair leather jacket black pants
looks more like a rock star than a criminal
his eyes are flat and there is an intensity about him that is unnerving
zero casually nods to daniel
zero stares at sami as daniel leads him over
to sami this is zero
im one and this is two three four and five
sami laughs at his little joke
the others cringe
one look in zeros eyes tells sami what everyone else already knows this is not someone to fuck with
julien puts his arm around sami and leads him away from the others
let me give you some advice
you dont want to piss him off because hell kill you for the fun of it
what you want to do is keep your mouth shut and do what we tell you
in french so we are going to america
sami doesnt speak french
where are you from
and you dont speak french
well you know not all algerians speak french
its a matter of what school you went too
me i never really overlapping zero isnt interested in your life story
to daniel who gets killed
hopefully no one
confused no one
then why is zero here
sami leans over to raymond
he speaks about himself in the third person
feel free to correct him if you want
to zero i just want you there in case theres trouble
and if there is then zero can kill someone
daniel and the others step out carrying their suitcases
the door to a limousine opens and marcel gets out
the scene is in french
to daniel i thought i would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage
and tell you that marcel will be going with you
this is a considerable move up for you daniel
the temptation of having so much money might be too much for you
you dont trust me
i dont trust anyone
you dont get to the top of this game by trusting people
and after all you are a thief
its in your nature to steal
im just protecting my investment
for many of them this is the first time they have ever been inside a limo
julien pours himself a drink
sami plays around with the air conditioner
zero turns on the radio and clicks through a few stations until he comes to renaud singing des que le vent souffera
he leans back in his seat bobbing his head to the music
marcel doesnt like it
he changes the station
we hear johnny hallyday singing que je taime
zero doesnt like it
he pushes the button returning to the renaud song and stares at marcel
marcel not to be outdone returns the hallyday song
like two children they click the buttons of the radio switching back and forth between renaud and hallyday
bastaldi has had enough
both of you
he turns off the radio
a long beat
marcel like a child who has to have the last word starts singing to himself quietly but loud enough for zero to hear
singing que je taime
marcel sees bastaldi glaring at him and stops
daniel and the crew get into a mini van taxi
quick cuts of the familiar sights of the city
the sears building
chicago board of trade building
then with each successive cut the beauty of the city seems to fade until we are in
an industrial section of the city
run down buildings
graffiti filled walls and burnt out hulls of abandoned cars line the street
the taxi driver leans out his window
are you sure you guys have the right address
this aint no tourist area
marcel looks at a piece of paper he is holding
we are sure
the taxi speeds off leaving them standing on the sidewalk their bags in a pile
suddenly from out of nowhere three black toughs appear and walk over
daniel looks behind him and sees another two approaching from the rear
zero calmly sits down on one of the suitcases
let me handle this
lamar s the leader of the group steps forward
whats happening man
sami raises his hand as if to greet lamar
dont you brother me motherfucker
sami looks like an idiot with his hand up in the air
he casually lowers it
lamar looks over the group and grins
whats in the bags
lamar forces a laugh
thats a good one
let me explain something to you
this is my street and youre gonna give me want i what or im gonna bust your heads open
raymond steps forward and places his hand on lamars arm
lamar violence is never an answer to settling disputes
i can see you have a lot of anger
but this is not the way to get it out
get outta my face
lamar removes a knife
the others in his group bring out an assortment of clubs chains and pipes
now are you going to give me the suitcases
or are we going to have to take them
zero is still sitting on one of the suitcases
va te faire foutre
what did he say
he said to go fuck yourself
we are tired and bored with your bullshit
so put that stupid little knife away before zero shoves it up your ass
who is zero
to julien he speaks about himself in the third person
julien shrugs his shoulders
maybe zero would like to get off his ass and take my knife from me
if you insist
zero stands up and raises his hand
he is holding a
he aims it at lamars head
lamars brave exterior quickly fades now that he is looking down the barrel of the gun
the rest of his gang turns and runs away
zero aims the gun at his groin
leave now before zero shoots off those little raisins you call balls
lamar runs away
daniel and the others smile at zero as they pick up their bags and walk towards a building
zero is left with sami who stares at him with disbelief
you put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs
how stupid is that
zero did not put it in his bag
he put it in yours
zero grins and walks away
the crew stands at a door
a peep hole in the door is opened and an eye looks them over
we are looking for sophie
laurant send us
the door is opened by sophie the girl in the photo on bastaldis computer
she is late s beautiful
softly ouh la la
an old building the rooms are partitioned off by sheets hanging from the ceiling
the main area is an artists workspace where large abstract paintings lean against the wall
i wasnt expecting this many of you
ive got a few sleeping bags you can use
of to the side sitting on the couch is wayne s a burn out with long hair and a scraggly goatee
his face is buried in a bong as he sucks in a lung full of marijuana
he watches a cartoon show on the television
to all of them this is wayne
raymond walks over to him
i am raymond
thank you for allowing us to stay here
no problem man
offers him the bong hey you wanna hit
no thank you
raymond looks at the television and sees a cartoon show
oh pepe le pew
he is very funny and quite well known in france
yeah i dig him
although a cartoon i feel he shares a universal theme we are all searching for love
wayne stares at him with a dead pan expression as he tries to assemble a coherent thought
you guys hungry
because of the hour the room is not crowded
only a few people sit at the counter sipping coffee
a waitress s bee hive hair style face covered in make up arrives at the table
ready to order
julien looks up at her
could we see a wine list please
smirks thats cute
they dont have a wine list
oh then we will have the house wine
sure and would you like that before your escargot in white truffle sauce
i did not order escargot
they dont serve wine here
what kind of restaurant doesnt serve wine
i will have a beer
i dont think hes grasping the concept
iced tea lemonade coca cola sprite or root beer
to the others cest quoi root beer
hell have a sprite
well all have sprite
now that weve gotten the beverage selection out of the way dare we move on to the main course
zero grins as he puts a cigarette in his mouth
the waitress pulls it out of his mouth
and no smoking
in french no smoking
what kind of country is this
vinny s not the brightest bulb on the tree
his head snaps back as someone punches him in the face
blood flows from his nose
we are in
two gangsters stand on each side of vinny
they are joey two tons s could have a second career as a sumo wrestler
nicky the rake s thin a rail
they make a strange pair but they both have one thing in common they are stone cold killers
standing in front of the them is frankie zammito s a wise guy tough as they come
he wears a well tailored suit black leather gloves and polished shoes
frightened im sorry frankie
vinny gets off his knees and moves towards zammito
you bleed on me ill kill ya
vinny takes a step back
whatd i tell you
whatd i tell you when you came to me for money
didnt i ask you not to do it
did i not say that
to joey whatd i say to him
you said dont do it boss
i said dont do it
did you listen to me
you wanted the money
so i lent you twenty large
now its been three weeks and you aint paid a dime
what do you think that makes me look like on the street
i dont do something to you and everyone will think they can skate
frankie i shut up
dont you try to make me feel bad about this
you knew what would happen to you if you didnt pay
this is on your head not mine
to joey and nicky break his arm
vinny looks up at zammito through pleading eyes
jesus frankie im your brother
thats why were only breaking one arm
the table is littered with plates
sophie has sketched out a diagram of a house on her napkin
theres an exterior alarm system
theres also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector
the control panel is in the bedroom
i can handle the exterior alarm but the one in the bedroom is a problem
after the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window
zero and julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector
the rest of us will come in through the front door
what about transportation
you can use my car
not a good idea
someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you
raymond youll steal one
when do we go
i know they wont be home tonight
you ever hear of jet lag
take a nap
as they crew and sophie approach the door we hear the muted roar of loud music
as the enter the music is even louder
the bass pounds through the walls
wayne seems oblivious to it as he sits on the couch smoking a joint
what the hell is that
they do this all the time
i cant even hear myself think
how are we supposed to sleep with this noise
ive asked them a hundred times to keep in down
they dont listen
i will talk to them
sophie and wayne both find his offer amusing
not a good idea
its just a matter of communication
raymond walks towards a door at the end of the building
the music grows louder
he knocks on the door and waits
it is opened by a very large man
a biker type leather jacket full beard several long earrings hanging from his ear
he is holding a beer bottle
behind him are two other rough looking men
cheerfully loudly over the music hello
my name is raymond
i am visiting next door and i was wondering if you could make your music a little less loud
the biker takes a sip of his beer
but the music is very before raymond can finish his sentence the biker pours his beer over raymonds head
he slams the door in raymonds face
the music continues to pound through the walls
a soggy raymond steps into the room
he walks over to a chair and sits down his head hung down embarrassed
marcel is angered by this
he glances over to daniel who subtly nods to him
marcel leaves the room
marcel walks purposefully along the side of the building
he reaches into his jacket pocket and removes two black leather gloves
he slips them on as he approaches the door then knocks
the biker opens the door
listen asshole i told you marcel head butts him slamming his forehead into the bridge of his nose
the biker clasps his hands over his bleeding nose
marcel grabs him by the hair and rapidly punches him in face several times each punch backing the biker into the room
on the last punch the biker falls backwards crashing through a large glass coffee table
biker moves in behind marcel and throws a hard punch as marcel turns around
marcel bends his head down so that his attackers fists slams into the hard crown of his skull
biker painfully grabs his broken knuckles
marcel knees him hard in the groin
biker turns to his side and doubles over
marcel kicks the man into the back of his knee spinning him around and down on his knees
in a fluid movement he elbows the man in the back of head
biker falls face forwards and is out cold
marcel turns to the third biker who is standing by the stereo
he is smaller than the others and has seen enough
he quickly turns off the power
wayne is on the couch with raymond
impressed whatd you say to them
a plain looking building in an old neighborhood of the city
zammito sits at his desk
joey two tons and nicky the rake sit on the couch
bobby beans balding stocky enters
hey bobby beans
how you doin
he walks up to zammito and they kiss each other on the cheek
im doing good
how you doin frankie
maranzano sends his warmest regards
when you return please extend my regards to mr
maranzano and his family
zammito motions for bobby to sit down
can i offer you something
no thank you
i just got a shipment of espresso from sicily
cant find anything like it in the states
i understand youre interested in one of our properties
that warehouse over on merchant street
the volume on our import business has risen dramatically
the proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the overlapping super what
it means better than expected
then why not just fuckin say better than expected
everybody knows what better than expected means
im taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills
im not here to negotiate
why are you here
to tell you that were interested in the property
you told me that on the phone
what the hell are you doing here
showing off your communication skills
go back to your people and tell them when theyre serious to put a number on the table
i will relay the particulars of our conversation to mr
yeah you do that
bobby beans leaves
zammito looks over at joey and nicky
hows my brother
hes over at st
they had to put two pins in his arm
i said a clean break
hey boss its not a science
send some flowers
roses or carnations
and one of those get well soon cards
nicky gets up to carry out his instructions
oh and uh send a case of steaks over to his house
i dont want the kids to go hungry while hes recuperating
julien and zero are playing cards at the back of the room
sami sitting by himself sorting through a black canvas bag filled with shoes
sophie joins him
sami pulls another pair of shoes out of the canvas bag
you like shoes
no i like the bag
it would be good for the job tonight
it belongs to vincent bastaldi
he left it last time he was here
im sure he wouldnt mind if you used it
sami dumps the rest of the shoes out of the bag
so how did you get hooked up with these guys
just lucky i guess
howd you start working for the bastaldis
the art world doesnt fully appreciate my talent yet
i needed some way to pay the rent
laurant and vincent pay well for information
so you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed
theyre not nice people
she sees a tattoo on samis arm
its a heart with someones faded name
i like your tattoo
sami is suddenly self conscious of it
she traces along the letters with her finger
reading the name casandra
something like that
did she break your heart
something like that
it looks old
did you get it a long time ago
you ask a lot of questions
thats how you get to know someone
did it hurt when you got it
i dont remember
i was drunk
you got it in a bar
i got it in prison
i went in for three years
when i came out she was married to my best friend
i didnt mean to pry
it was a long time ago
ive been thinking about getting tattoo
you know a flower or something
on my ass
sami looks at her quizzically
whos gonna see it there
the lucky ones
she smiles flirtatiously and walks away
a car drives up
we can only see the outline of an old chevy impala
two men get out of the car leaving the engine running as they head for the liquor store
across the street raymond is checking out a buick lasabre but stops when he sees the flashing alarm light on the dashboard
he looks across the street and sees the impala
an old man is behind the counter
two masked men enter with guns and rush up to the counter
gimme the money
the old man opens the cash register and hands him all the bills
open the safe
i dont have the combination
raphael pistol whips him with his gun and drags him half way over the counter then presses his gun to the old mans head
i dont have it
raphael pushes him to the floor
he runs out of the store with the others
they run out and remove their masks
raphael ruiz s latin tough shaved head neck covered with tattoos
hector latin small cubby stops and stares at something with confusion
hey vato wheres your car
raphael stops as he sees the street is empty
hector has to grab raphael who is too stunned to move and drag him down the street
the crew gets ready
on the table a variety of gear is laid out
cells phones electronic devices all the tools of the trade
sami throws some items into the black canvas bag
a cell phone rings
julien answers it
hes outside with the car
they grab their gear and head for the door
sophie leans over and kisses sami on the cheek
he stares at her half surprised half embarrassed
the crew steps out to find raymond in the impala
we can see it clearer now
its a low rider car
bright orange flames are painted on the side wire wheels and chrome exhaust pipes
im glad you didnt get something flashy
raymond pushes a button and the hydraulics make the car bounce up and down
sami rolls his eyes as the others get into the car
across the street lamar is standing in the shadows with one of his friends watching
the six of them are crammed into the car as it moves down the street
julien studies a map
raphael sits on the couch
he can barely contain his anger
he looks up slowly his jaw clenched
hector sits across from him with a few other gang bangers
maybe you should call the police
hey idiot ive got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car
i just thought that overlapping dont think
youre not good at it
the other gang bangers laugh at hector
go do something get some beers for the guys
hector slinks out of the room
raphaels face hardens
when i find out who did this im going to mount their head on my dashboard
a family operation
checkerboard table clothes
candles burning in chianti bottles
on the stereo vic damone sings angela mia
zammito waits at a table
his cell phone rings
into phone yeah
wants to see you
ive got a date with a drop dead major babe
ill tell him that
zammito thinks it over
he walks over to the mario the owner of the restaurant
mario i gotta go
when my date arrives tell her i had an emergency
of course mr
the impala is stopped in the parking lot
i think we went the wrong way
oh you think
the map said to go left
yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right
amused oh yeah
zammito enters to find angelo bonanno s powerful head of the chicago mob
he is smoking a cigar with a glass of brandy
frankie come in
good to see you
you want something
no im good angelo
bonanno motions to the couch
zammito sits down
i understand bobby beans came to see you today
seems maranzano wants to talk about buying the merchant street warehouse
hes just feeling us out
hes trying to get a foot hold in our territory
he sticks his toes in the water again well cut em off
business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property
i heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary
bonanno stares at him
theyre gonna be what
it means better than expected
half tooth tony s built like a tank step into the room
he has the face of a boxer several of his teeth are chipped or broken
bonanno i just wanted to remind you that you have an appointment in ten minutes
half tooth tony leaves
someone else coming
nah thats just tonys way of telling me judge judy starts in ten minutes
you ever watch it
uh no you should
you can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that
stay and watch it with me
you know im kind of tired
im just gonna go home if its all the same to you
bonanno affectionately slaps zammitos cheeks
bonanno takes a sip of his brandy but his eyes stay on zammito
oh frankie whats this i hear about your brother
he missed three weeks
your own brother
you couldnt send someone else to do it
joey two tons and nicky the rake did the deed
but you were there
angelo we live and die by the rules we make
we are men of honor but honor without respect is a
horse less carriage
a long beat
bonanno thinks about what he said not sure what to make of it then
what the fuck does that mean
the impala is by the pumps
sami leans out the window holding the map as he speaks with the station attendant
an upscale neighborhood
expensive homes line the wooded street
the impala stops and the crew gets out
to raymond park on the next street over
well meet you when were done
julien attaches a device to the alarm panel
a series of numbers flash by as the computer cracks the code
one by one the numbers stop until the entry code is displayed on the screen
he enters the numbers on the alarm and nods to the others
julien and zero move around to the side of the house as daniel sami and marcel wait in the shadows
julien places a retractable ladder against the wall and climbs up
he pries open the window and climbs in
julien makes his way to the door and repeats the process with another alarm panel
zero sits on the corner of the bed and waits patiently
julien turns off the hall alarm and nods to zero
zero speed dials a number on his cell phone
daniel uses a locksmith tool and quickly pries the lock out of the door
they go inside
julien and zero wait for them
we hear a toilet flush
the door to the bathroom opens and a man steps out
in an instant julien and zero jump him
the others enter and quickly join in to subdue the man
raymond waits in the impala
he cant resist using the hydraulics raising the car up and down
the lights are on
the room is an interior designers nightmare
clashing colors zebra skin bedspread
we move along daniel sami marcel julien and zero as they stare at something
their pov tied to a chair his mouth taped shut is a very angry frankie zammito
he yells his voice muffled by the tape but its not hard to understand what hes saying
so much for no one being home
julien goes to a bookcase and finds the safe
at least they got this right
he removes his tools and goes to work
sami stares at zammito with vague recognition then turns to the others
weve got to be careful not to use our real names while were in here
ill be elvis and you overlapping i want to be elvis
its my idea
whining cmon i look more like elvis than you do
you can be elvis
marcel smiles happily
and the rest of us are
john paul george and ringo
marcel sees an autographed baseball on the book shelf
hey barry bonds
the home run king
marcel tosses the ball into the black canvas bag
daniel stares at him
its for my nephew
a surveillance operation
two fbi agents sit near the window
a small card table is littered with coffee cups
special agent agent hadley s a hardened field agent picks up a pair of binoculars and looks out the window
his pov through the binoculars of zammito tied to the chair and surrounded by the others
looks like zammitos being robbed
should i call c
yeah but tell them not to move until these morons come out of the house
from inside the safe we see julien open the door
daniel and julien look inside
there are a several stacks of cash envelopes and a small cardboard box
julien starts removing everything and puts it into the bag canvas bag
where are the jewels
there arent any jewels
marcel looks as surprised as they are
there has to be
im telling you ive pulled out everything in the safe
there arent any jewels
there must be half a million dollars here though
marcel we came here for jewels remember
sami moves closer to zammito studying his face
he moves over to the dresser where there are several photographs of zammito with various famous people
next to the photographs is a plaque that reads to francis zammito
we can see the color drain from samis face
he glances over at zammito whose eyes are locked on his
sami grabs daniel and marcel and pulls them aside
babbling nervously we have a problem
problem isnt the right word
no that really doesnt describe flatly do you know who that is
no thats not mr
sensing something bad is coming its not
thats frankie zammito
the under boss of the chicago mafia
confused why would they want us to rob the mafia
screaming a beat
the three of them turn and look at zammito
the seriousness of the situation finally dawns on marcel
he moves over to zammito and rips the tape off his mouth
zammito there seems to have been a big mistake here
may i use your phone
marcel picks up the cordless phone and dials
bastaldi removes a sleep mask and answers the phone
in french its elvis
in french its me
marcel continues his conversation
in french yes
marcel contd we went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some mafia guy
in french youre there now
in french youre calling me on your cell phone right
in french youre calling me on is phone
in french my numbers going to show up on his bill
in french should i call you back
we can hear bastaldi sigh over the line
in french youve already robbed the safe
in french take what youve got and get out of there
bastaldi hangs up
the line goes dead
walk out of here with nothing and ill forget this ever happened
youre not a vendetta kind of guy
ill find you
no matter where you go ill find you
you dont carry the same weight in france as you do here
marcel whispers into daniels ear
you think its smart to tell him were french
i think hes already figured that out
zero who has been standing quietly by the window sees something across the street
light reflecting off glass
he takes a pair of night vision binoculars out of one of the bags and looks out the window
zeros pov of agent hadley and the other fbi agent watching him
we are being watched
daniel grabs the binoculars and looks
theyve been there for months
think i dont know
daniel closes the curtains
he tries to think
the crew huddles together in the corner speaking softly so zammito cant hear them
what do we do
i was told to take what we have and go
the police are outside
daniel looks at the others
if we do this we all have to agree
marcel and zero nod
daniel looks to julien who appears indecisive
i dont know
maybe if we did just leave
cmon get real will you
you think hes just going to forget about this
these guys are all about respect
all about honor
hes coming after us so we might as well take the money
sami walks over and grabs the black canvas bag
youre all dead
zero grins then tapes his mouth closed again
the crew goes out the back door and climb over a fence
the crew arrives to find raymond still playing with the hydraulics of the impala
they get in
the impala pulls into a driveway and goes to the rear of the building out of view from the street
the crew waits as the door is unlocked
wayne opens the door in a stoned haze
the crew places their equipment on the table
wayne who is it
she enters and appears surprised to see them
i wasnt expecting you guys back so fast
howd it go
she quickly notices their angry expressions
howd it go
i dont know
daniel how would you say it went
i would have to say
pretty fuckin bad
you gave us the wrong address sophie
no i didnt
bastaldi got the address from you yes
and he gave it to us
it was an honest mistake
everyone get some sleep
were leaving in the morning
agent hadley checks his watch
what the hell are they doing in there
says they cant hold the units here any longer
they want to know if they should go in
agent hadley thinks a moment
tell them no
well advise if anything changes
zammito is still tied to his chair
his pov of the cordless phone of his bed
he pushes with his feet sliding the chair over to the bed then starts rocking back and forth until he tips over forward his face pressed against the mattress
using his nose he turns on the phone and presses a speed dial number
joey two tons is asleep in a sleeveless tee shirt
next to him is his wife her hair in curlers her eyes covered by a black sleep mask
the phone rings
joey answers it
we hear zammitos muffled cries for help
it almost sounds like someone moaning during a sexual act
joey is surprised at first then glances over at his wife to make sure she is asleep
he slides his hand under the covers and closes his eyes
uh huh zammito stops as he begins to realize what joey is doing on the other end of the line
he grimaces then shouts louder
joey is really going to town now as his hand moves slowly under the covers
we hear a loud scream on the phone
thats right baby give it to papa joey
he is really deep into his fantasy world when
joey who is that
joey sits up quickly
loudly for his wifes sake and dont call here again you pervert
he slams the phone down
a long beat
it rings again
this time he checks his caller id and sees that call is coming from zammitos house
again we hear the same muffled cries
raphael enters with hector and two gang bangers
the room is filled with low rider cars
working under the hood of a car is felix s sleazy
raphael walks over and slams the hood down pinning felixs upper body and squishing his face between the hood and engine
someone stole my car tonight
cmon raphael you dont think that i would steal your car
you run a chop shop for low riders
yes i think youd steal my car
raphael lifts up the hood and slams it down on felix again
i swear i didnt
and i should just believe overlapping to felix you stole my cousin enriques car
to hector hector dont interrupt me
he told enrique he didnt know anything about his car
i dont give a shit about your cousins car
were here about my car
so shut your mouth
you think you can do that
you think you can keep your big mouth shut
hector is embarrassed as raphael once again berates him in front of the others
raphael picks up a pair of pliers of the workbench
he clamps them down on the tip of felixs nose and squeezes
felixs face fills with pain
if i find out youre lying
if i find out you know anything about this im going to come back and cut off your nose
he gives the pliers one last squeeze then releases felix
to the others vamos
agent hadley sips a cup of warm coffee
he looks very concerned
sir do you think we could have a hostage situation in there
agent hadley is about to answer when he sees something
his pov of a lincoln town car pull up
joey two tons gets out goes to the front door and enters
hold on a second
joey two tons just pulled up
joey enters to find zammito tied to the chair face down on the bed
zammito stands behind the bar pouring himself a large scotch
they were all french guys
you mean like from france
with strained patience yeah french guys from france
whatd they take
boy you must be pissed
well you know when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night stick guns in my face tie me up and steal from me
it does irritate me
well i must say youre handling it very well
you know why im handling it very well
because youre going to get these guys for me
where are they
if i knew where they were you wouldnt have to find them would you
you didnt say find them
you said get them
just find them
zammito stares at joey for a long beat then
joey looks away embarrassed
sami cant sleep
he walks over to the table and sorts through the canvas bag containing the contents of zammitos safe
inside a small cardboard box he finds several cassette tapes
he removes the box and walks to the stereo system on the floor then inserts a tape into the cassette deck
a moment later sophie enters
im sorry things went so wrong today
its not your fault
she notices the box of tapes
what are you doing
i thought id listen to some of the tapes
see whats so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe
its three in the morning
not much else to do
she grins seductively then leans in towards him
i can think of something
sami is asleep on the floor curled up under several blankets
he wakes up and looks to his side expecting to find sophie
she is not there
sami looks around for her
wayne is sitting on the couch preparing his morning joint
shes not here man
where is she
i think she went to do some laundry
threw some stuff in a bag and left
it takes a moment for sami to connect the thoughts
sami runs to the table
the black canvas bag is gone
close on daniel asleep
sami shakes him
he opens his eyes
weve been ripped off
daniel and sami are with the crew
they are not a happy bunch
wayne is smoking his joint his eyes locked on the television
this is bullshit
you cant trust anyone these days
she took everything
didnt even leave us cab fare
a thought occurs to sami
he removes the tape he put in the cassette deck last night before sophie entered
i was going to listen to it last night but i he realizes it may not be the time to tell them what happened
wayne blurts out a sloppy laugh
no you didnt dude
you were bangin sophie
i saw you guys going at it
you slept with her
well actually i would say she slept with me
daniel stares at him angrily
whats the big deal
its not like i was on guard duty or something
you didnt think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you
chicks dig me
daniel grabs the cassette and puts it in the player
on the tape we hear a phone ringing
i need an answer from you if im going to move
were not just talkin about a piece of work here
were talking about a boss
sami is the first to realize what he is hearing
sami holds his hand signaling them to be quiet so he can hear the rest
bonannos a dinosaur
guy thinks hes fuckin vito corleone or something
the old ways are gone
if we dont change now were going to get pushed out
i need to know if i can count on your support
a pause on the line
the line goes dead
sami leans back
no wonder zammito didnt want us to walk out with this stuff
hes planning on killing bonanno and taking over the family
this wasnt the deal
the deal was to steal a necklace not get in the middle of a mafia war
the deal is whatever mr
bastaldi says it is
you know if you could get your nose out of bastaldis ass for two seconds you might see whats going on around you
i knew this was a mistake
i knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this
i could hear that little voice in my head saying dont do it
dont you do it
jesus why dont i ever listen to myself
yeah but you did do it
so lets deal with that
what are you guys so scared of
zammito doesnt know who we are
we just get out of town and its over
oh you think its that easy
we just go home
i agree with marcel
i say we go to the airport and get on a plane
theyll be waiting for us at the airport
you steal some money from a man he gets over it in time
but these tapes
hes never going to stop looking for us
we have to find sophie
how are we going to do that
i know where she went
they all look over at him as he takes a huge hit off his joint
i heard her talking on the phone
bay view motel
its about five blocks from here
a beat up ford pinto sputters down the street black smoke spewing from the tail pipe
raphael is at the wheel his eyes scanning the street for his car
in the passenger seat hector sits calmly
they come to a red light and stop
raphaels pov across the street is low rider car
raphael stares at it as he thinks about his own car
we see the impala pull up beside them
raymond is driving
daniel sami and zero are with him
hector glances over and sees the impala
raymond smiles at him and nods
hector slowly nods back
he looks over at raphael who is still looking out the window
the light turns green
the impala turns right
raphael looks over at a confused hector
tell me the truth hector
do you think well find my car
hard to say
a motel like any other
sami stands outside the office with daniel raymond and zero
how do we know what room shes in
behind the counter is the motel clerk middle aged balding
did a woman just check in
shes about five six
i cant give out information on our guests
cmon man i think shes having an affair
so are half the people in this place
i cant help you pal
sami nods and walks outside
through the window we see him talking with the others
sami steps back inside with zero
look i cant tell you before he can finish the sentence zero has his gun out and wedged under the clerks jaw
the others stand off to the side of the door
sophie opens the door and sees sami
before she can slam it he pushes it open
sami pushes her onto the bed
i really thought we had something special going
i cant tell you what a disappointment youve turned out to be
after last night i could say the same for you
sami feigns a smile
zero checks the bathroom to make sure she is alone
he looks at daniel and shake his head
raymond finds the black canvas bag on the dresser and checks the contents
the money isnt here
where is it sophie
i dont know
if you think because youre a women this cant go hard on you think again
she stares at them defiantly
who are you waiting for
stick around and find out
a knock on the door
sami clamps his hand over sophies mouth just in case she gets any stupid ideas
daniel opens the door
agent hadley steps in stares at daniel then feels the barrel of zeros gun pressed against his head
hadley steps into the room
daniel closes the door
zero searches him
finds a gun which he gives to daniel then a wallet
he opens it and sees his fbi identification
zero knowingly bends down and removes hadleys backup gun which is strapped to his ankle
he gives the gun to sami
what is she doing with an agent du fbi
sami looks at her at hadley at the black canvas bag
slowly it starts to come together in his mind
weve been set up
he stares at sophie angrily
we didnt go to the wrong house
we went to right one didnt we sophie
her expression gives away nothing
they send us to zammitos house
the fbi is right across the street watching the whole thing but they dont move
a crime is going down and they dont move
beat because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us
what does arresting us get them
to hadley you wanna tell him
youre telling it fine
daniel motions to zero
you see my friend over there
i nod to him and hes going to put a bullet in your knee
zero stares at hadley just waiting for daniel to give him the go ahead
zero aims his gun at hadleys knee cap
thats going to make a lot of noise
not much time for a conversation after you pull the trigger
they know hes right
hes got a point
sami lifts up a heavy brass lamp from the nightstand
he pulls the electrical cord out of the base then touches two wires together
before hadley can say a word sami touches them to his hand
hadleys body jerks violent as he screams
sami removes the wires
hadley winces in pain from the burn mark on his hand
weve been investigating zammito for years but weve never had enough evidence for a warrant to search his house
we got word through a snitch that zammito was planning on taking bonanno out
we know all this
you just dont take out a boss
you need permission from the other families to do something like that
our informant told us that zammito was talking with other bosses and recording their conversations in case they later claimed they werent involved
look at these tapes
the guy has recorded every conversation hes had for years
so we rob zammito
you arrest us when we come out and the contents of the safe is now evidence which you can use against him
agent hadley nods
to sophie what are you getting out of this
there is no point in hiding anything now
it was supposed to simple
in and out
sophie contd zammito wasnt supposed to be there
we see zammito walk over to mario
mario i gotta go
when my date arrives will you explain to her i had an emergency
of course mr
through the window we see joey two tons open the door to the car
zammito and joey get in and drive away
a taxi pulls up
the front door opens and sophie enters all dressed up and beautiful
she walks up to mario
im meeting frankie zammito sami stares at her with contempt
vincent bastaldi is in jail
laurant and vincent were in business with zammito
what kind of business
black market art
zammito got to a few key security guards at the metropolitan museum
the bastaldis supplied the artists to make copies of famous works
theyd switch the paintings send the originals to paris and the bastaldis would sell them to private collectors
were talking matisse renoir monet
we know for sure they replaced van goghs vase with twelve sunflowers last week with a copy
it was on loan from the london national gallery and theyre not going to be very happy when they find out about it
so bastaldi makes a deal with the feds to trade up for his brother
he delivers the goods on zammito
if we got what we wanted wed let his brother go providing he tells us where the van gogh and the other paintings are
no one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison
raymond get the bag
you walk out with that bag and you wont only have zammito and his people after you
youll have the entire united states justice department
how far do you think youll get
i know who you are mr
looks at zero mr
agent hadley looks to sophie
thats all i know
youll never get out of the city
they move to the door
daniel sami raymond and zero walk to the impala
he is fuckin dead
you want zero to kill him
im going to kill him myself
what about the money
it has to be at sophies
she didnt have time to go anywhere else before she came here
we dont know that for sure
forget the money
weve got bigger problems than the money right now
she probably hid it at her place
the six of us could find it in overlapping we dont have time to look for it
hadleys first move is going to be to look for us there
daniel dials a number on his cell phone
pack up and be on the street in five minutes
agent hadley steps out of the bathroom a towel wrapped around the burn on his hand
this is turning to shit
if word gets out of my involvement in this ill go to prison
listen we know their names
they dont know the city
youll find them
youre the fbi
i cant bring the bureau into this
if i do the tapes become evidence
theyre supposed to be evidence
thats why bastaldi set this up
fuck bastaldi and his brother
these tapes are gold
do you have any idea what zammito would pay to get them back
i thought you wanted zammito
the minute i get him some other gavone will take his place
ive been doing this for twenty years
when i retire its not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs
she likes the idea
already shes thinking how she can work her way into this
too many people know about my involvement in this
then we just have to make sure everyone who knows cant say anything
his jaw tightens
youre right about that
hadley is standing behind her
he lifts up the brass lamp with his towel and swings down hard towards sophies head
marcel julien and wayne are waiting as the impala drives up
raymond hops out of the car
i would like to thank you for your hospitality
hands him a card if you are ever in paris here is my number
marcel grabs raymond and leads him back to the car
daniel sees lamar standing across the street
to the others ill be right back
he gets out of the car and walks over to him
what do you want now
can you get them
man i can get anything
dont bullshit me
i aint bullshittin
i can get guns
i can get any kind of gun you want
but they aint gonna help your sorry ass
you aint been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in chicago looking for you
how is that possible
ive got a way with people
i can see that
the mans car you stole
hes head of the th street gang and one crazy motherfucker
and frankie zammitos got the word out hes looking for some french dudes
youre french aint ya
im from belgium
yeah id be from belgium too if i was you
you know zammito just put his own brother in the hospital
broke his arm cause he was late on a debt
i mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin for you
why havent you turned us in
i aint no rat
beat you got money right
and uh im going to have to charge you a commission
kind of like a brokerage fee
a thousand dollars
daniel hands him his cell phone
ill call you in a few hours
you tell me where we meet
wayne is on the couch watching tv
there is a loud knock on the door
he opens the door to find agent hadley
hadley pushes past wayne and enters
hey dude what do you think youre doing
hadley flashes his badge
excuse me but dont you need a warrant or something
where are your friends
they left about a half hour ago
where did they go
hadley punches wayne in the face
wayne falls to the floor
hey man you cant do that
agent hadley kicks wayne in the chest
agent hadley kicks wayne in the ribs
what kind of fbi agent are you
im your worst fuckin nightmare
now if you dont want me to keep on hurting you its important that i believe you and right now i dont
so tell me where did they go
i swear man i dont know
they packed up and left a half hour ago
points to coffee table all i got is one of their phone numbers in paris
hadley sees the phone number raymond gave wayne on the coffee table
he puts it in his pocket and stares at wayne then just for the hell of it gives him one last kick in the ribs
a maid stops her cart in front of room fourteen
she uses her key and steps into the room
we hear a loud scream
a large building near the freeway
raymond is on the phone
in french i know mama but i couldnt call you yesterday we were very busy
listens no nothings more important than you
listens i dont know
i think im going to have to stay a few more days
daniel sami and julien sit at a table
marcel stares out the window sadly
zero is flipping through the television channels
to marcel did you know about bastaldis deal with zammito
i think if he told me he was going to steal van goghs sunflowers in a vase i would remember it
correcting him vase with twelve sunflowers
he never told me about the van gogh or any of the other paintings
raymond hangs up the phone and joins the others
it makes sense
i mean do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up
i think hed cut his dick off if bastaldi told him to
you know id never go along with something like this
this aint about that and you know it
this is about you never forgiving me for leaving the crew
surprised you guys used to work together
yeah and he cant stand it that i tried to do something to better myself
in french you call being bastaldis lap dog better
in french better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night
all right knock it off
in french all you are is a professional ass kisser
in french im not a guy who is known for his patience and right now youre testing mine
in french what is that a threat
are you fuckin threatening me marcel
they take a step towards each other
sami steps in between them
i said knock it off
now as far as im concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over but right now weve got to figure out whats going on
bastaldis moving up
hes closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us
well i say the whole deal is off
in fact if you ask me there never was a deal because we were screwed from the start
zero turns to another channel
a news broadcast
we see a mug shot photo of sami on the screen
hey sami youre on tv
zero turns up the volume
sami zerhouni in connection with the murder of sophie nichols
sami is stunned
police have confirmed that zerhouni was seen entering the womans room by the motel manager
the reporter continues her story
zerhouni is also wanted by police for questioning regarding a robbery last night at the home of alleged mafia member frankie zammito
we are now in
zammito grimaces as the news of the robbery becomes public
the reporter continues
the other members of his gang are reported to be french nationals daniel foray marcel burot julien labesse
pull back again
lamar is sitting on the couch watching the news report with amusement
dumb crackers the reporter finishes her story
raymond gayet and an unidentified man only known as zero
pull back again
hadley grins as he watches the report
that should shake things up
a vacation get away on a budget we are back in
sami turns off the television and looks to the others
hadley has to be
freaking out this is bad
this is really fuckin bad
am i the only one who sees how bad this is
hey its not your picture on the tv its mine
so try to be cool
dont tell me to be cool
we were supposed to be in and out
in and out
in the last twenty four hours weve managed to get the mafia
the chicago police department and a group of latin gang members after us
i havent left out anyone have i
pretends to think about it i dont think so because weve already pissed off everyone in the fuckin city
weve got to get out of here
care to elaborate
sami gets into juliens face
youre not helping
julien what youre doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress
youre projecting your anger onto us
julien walks away
daniel picks up the phone and dials a number
the cell phone daniel gave him rings
he answers it
hey you guys are becoming famous
i was just watching the news and overlapping did you set it up
barclay hotel on river street
oh and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it im going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred
we had a deal
we had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime
the line goes dead
lamar grins happy with the money hes going to make
the others are looking at daniel
sami tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us
we need to rent a car and for that you need a credit card
why not just steal another one
we dont need to get pulled over because of a stolen car
maybe im missing the obvious but why arent we leaving town
any place has to be safer for us than chicago
it doesnt matter where we go
between zammito and the fbi theyll find us
we have to end this here
and how do we do that
i dont know
thats an excellent plan
well think of something
a lincoln town car drives up
zammito gets out with joey two tons and nicky the rake
they wait outside
bonanno is behind his desk
half tooth tony sits on the couch
bonanno walks around his desk and hugs zammito
why didnt you tell me about this
you have enough to worry about angelo
you dont need my problems
bonanno places his hands on zammitos cheeks and presses them together
an insult to you is an insult to me
bonanno releases him
they knew who you were when they broke in your house
what is happening with the world
there was a time no civilian would touch a made man
now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something
what did they take
the other stuff i can replace but theres a cardboard box
photos of my mother
theyre the only ones i have of her
were doing everything we can to find these people
weve reached out to everyone we know
if theyre still stupid enough to be in this city tony will find them
zammito steps out onto the street
joey two tons and nicky the rake are pitching pennies against the wall
they start arguing about something
frankie come here a second
zammito walks over
who is closer to the wall joey or me
impatiently get in the car
just tell me whos closer to the wall
zammito grabs him by the neck and smashes his face into the wall
now get in the fuckin car
both men walk to the car
zammito starts after them then stops
he turns back picks up the coins and puts them in his pocket
sami moves through a crowd of people
he looks around until he sees a man who looks remarkably similar to raymond
sami bumps into him and lifts his wallet
marcel waits as a salesperson brings over several boxes of electronic equipment
sami passes the shop
in the window is black canvas bag that is identical to the one that they used on the job
he goes into the store
an old building that has seen better days
daniel and zero get out of a taxi and go inside
looks even worse on the inside
a dark corridor is lit by bare light bulbs hanging from the ceiling
an old prostitute walks past them her smile signaling she is open for business
they arrive at room and knock
the door is opened by a very large black man
behind him we can see lamar with ellwood s sun glasses his neck draped in gold chains
very loud im gonna have to search you
well save you the trouble
daniel pulls back his jacket to reveal the gun he took from hadley in his waistband
loudly you cant come in here with that
daniel looks past him to ellwood
whats wrong with this guy
hes my cousin
daniel removes an envelope full of cash
were here to buy not steal
if you guys are straight theres not going to be a problem
ellwood stomps his foot several times on the floor
the black guy feels the vibration and turns around
let them in
the black guy steps aside
daniel and zero enter
ellwood is sitting on the bed behind several open suitcases displaying a variety of weapons
what can i do you for
daniel looks over the merchandise
how much for the nines

daniel starts counting out the money
ellwood points a
magnum hes been holding behind the open suitcase at them
what the hell you doing ellwood

zammitos offering twenty grand a head for these guys
you think im going to settle for four gs when i can make forty
to daniel all right
reach in easy and put the gun on the floor
daniel slowly grabs his gun and places it on the floor then kicks it under the bed
i said put it on the floor not kick it under the bed
ellwood speaks to his cousin speaking slowly and enunciating each word so he can read his lips
get that and add it to my inventory
the black guy get on his hands and knees and starts looking for the gun under the bed
as he does daniel glances over at zero with a look
ellwood aims his gun at zero
i assume youre carrying too
zero opens his coat and reveals his
okay put it on the floor
and do not kick it under the fuckin bed
he stares at ellwood calmly through dead flat eyes
did you just say no
listen cowboy if youre thinking about makin a move dont
nobody is that fast
ellwood is confused
daniel bolts to his left
ellwoods eyes leave lamar for a moment its a moment too long
in a blur of movement zero has his gun out and fires one shot into ellwoods forehead
ellwood slumps down on the bed dead
the black guy who has heard nothing continues searching under the bed
zero casually picks up the suitcase filled with guns and hands it to daniel
they walk out of the room
lamar stands there stunned then quickly runs after them
the black guy pops up with daniels gun oblivious to what has transpired in the room
daniel pushes lamar out the door
zero steps out behind him
he stares at lamar for a long moment then hands him the envelope
theres ten grand in here
im going to call you again
theres one more thing i need you to do
ill tell you when its time
in the background we hear the loud agonizing scream from the black guy as he finds ellwoods body
raymond and julien approach the counter
raymond is nervous
in french i am not comfortable with this
im not a good liar
in french relax
it will be fine
they arrive at the counter
the rental agent a man in his s looks up at them with a smile
i am robert m
carney from dayton ohio and i would like to rent a car with my visa gold card
raymond smiles a big friendly completely over exaggerated smile
julien looks at him and rolls his eyes
the rental agent walks down to the end of the counter and dials a number on the phone
into phone i got a couple french guys here trying to rent a car
i can stall them
vinny is in bed his arm in a cast and sling
his wife angie s big hair loud clothes
she sits on the bed feeding him
his two kids richie and tommy sit off to the side

vinny stares blankly at his brother
zammito takes a step back looks her up and down
he lays on the charm
hey youre looking good

zammito moves over to the kids and offers a quick hello
zammito pulls out a roll of bills that could choke a horse and peels one off
angie take the kids down to the gift shop and buy em something

angie looks at the money
flatly gee five bucks

several low rider cars are parked on the street

sami is recording something on a tape deck marcel bough
he sees marcel outside on the balcony and removes a piece of paper from his pocket then picks up the phone and dials
do you know who this is
i figured id be hearing from you
if you ever want to get those tapes meet me in one hour at grant park near the statue
the rental agent walks back over to raymond and julien
im sorry about the wait
there was a problem with the equipment
everything okay now
the rental agents eyes drift to a black lincoln town car parked across the street
a lincoln pulls up
zammito gets out and walks over to three wiseguys in another town car
one of the wiseguys points to the window of the rental agency
zammito looks at raymond and julien
i dont know the little one but the other guy is definitely one of them
follow them and call me when you find out where they go
zammito walks back to his car and drives off
an employee drives up in a cadillac de ville
he gets out and julien grabs the keys from him
in french ill drive
in french im the driver
in french ive never driven a cadillac before
raymond nods and gets in the passenger seat
the cadillac moves down the street
the lincoln follows a few cars behind them
julien drives the car
in french this is a car
i think this is the best american car ive ever driven
in french this is the only american car youve ever driven
agent hadley walks towards the statue wearing a pair of sun glasses
as he approaches sami steps out
you set me up you piece of shit
hadley pushes him up against the statue and starts frisking him
what are you doing
you think im going to talk to you until i know if youre wired
i aint wired
sami lifts up his shirt showing hadley his bare chest
he drops his pants down to his ankles
i believe you
you killed her
you killed her
manager remembers you going into her room
your fingerprints were found all over the place
she was alive when we left her with you
youre fucked sami
you know it
thats why youre here
look i just want out of this nightmare
i dont know these guys
a few days ago im in paris picking pockets and now im americas most wanted
where are the tapes
i can get them but what do i get if i do
how you gonna give me a pass
a witness can put me at the crime scene
witness can be convinced they made a mistake
without the murder weapon the d
wont have enough to prosecute you
they dont have a murder weapon
i have it
the one with your fingerprints and her blood on it
holds up his burned hand remember
sami is stunned then his thoughts snap back to
sami picking up the brass lamp off the nightstand and leaving his fingerprints all over it
sami stares angrily at hadley who appears to be enjoying his frustration
of course they could always get an anonymous tip
find it in the dumpster behind the motel
sami stares at him a long moment
you want the tapes for yourself
youre going to sell them
im going to retire with a shit load of money
find me a small country that doesnt have an extradition treaty with the states and live the good life
you didnt have to kill sophie
yes i did
lose ends are messy
what about me

when this is over you can say whatever the hell you want
ill be long gone
besides whos going to believe you
youre just a two bit crook
and youre a dirty cop
at least i dont pretend to be something different than what i am
hadley hands him a card
when youve got the tapes call me on this number
well make the exchange and thatll be the end of it
julien drives the cadillac along the north river
the lincoln keeps pace with them several cars behind
raymond clicks through a few radio stations
julien glances in his rear view mirror
his pov in the mirror of the lincoln several cars back
julien seems concerned
he turns the steering wheel hard to the right
the cadillac cuts across the right lane almost hitting a car and turns onto another street
the lincoln makes a sharp move to stay up with it
raymond looks over at julien
in french were being followed
julien hits the gas
the cadillac speeds down the street weaving in and out of traffic
the lincoln does the same
the cadillac reaches an intersection
the traffic ahead of them is stopped for a red light
the cadillac veers onto the sidewalk
pedestrians jump out of the way and the car streaks down the pavement
behind the lincoln follows
the cadillac screeches around the corner onto a one way street
julien concentrates as he weaves the car in and out of the on coming traffic
in french i knew i should have driven
in french stop talking
im trying to concentrate
the oncoming traffic veers off
the lincoln clips a car loses control for a moment then continues after them
at the corner the cadillac turns onto another street and joins traffic in the right direction
the lincoln moves up along side the cadillac
two wiseguys lean out the window with guns in their hands
the cadillac veers away just as they start shooting
bullets riddle the car
raymond removes hadleys backup gun
the lincoln pulls up beside them again
the sound of gun fire fills the air as raymond shoots from the cadillac
the rear passenger window of the lincoln shatters and raymond fires
the lincoln drops back
the cadillac turns the corner
the lincoln follows
the traffic is heavier here
the cars have to slow down
the lincoln moves beside them again
raymond fires his last shot
his gun his now empty
several rounds of gun fire come from the lincoln
raymond looks over to julien
in french what are we going to his voice trails off as he sees julien
a bullet has glanced his neck not deep but deep enough to sever an artery
blood pours down his neck and covers his shirt
his face is pale
he glances at the wound in the rear view mirror
julien steers the caddy onto another street
the towncar follows
julien looks at raymond
he is paler now his shirt completely covered with blood
he strains to stay conscious
in french when we get to the next corner jump out
in french im not going to leave you
in french we both know im already dead
raymond knows hes right
the car races into the next turn
in french go
raymond opens the door
he jumps out
of raymond as he rolls towards the curb
the caddy skids around the corner
the lincoln slams on its brakes in the middle of an intersection
raymond is dazed from his fall
he gets up slowly his pants torn and sees
the driver is reaching out the window with his gun to take aim and is just about to shoot when
julien comes racing into the intersection full speed and smashes into the lincoln
the impact sends the lincoln spinning around
when it stops the drivers window is facing the front of the caddy
the driver of the caddy takes aim and fires
the bullet goes through the windshield and kills julien
the driver looks over at the passenger just in time to see
speeds through the intersection and smashes head on into the lincoln
it crumbles like a toy under the weight
raymond limps into the street oblivious to the oncoming traffic
he stares sadly at julien
zero and marcel are checking over the guns
daniel writes some notes on a pad of paper
sami appears nervous as he sits off to the side
the door opens
raymond limps into the room
his face is dirty bruised his pants torn legs scraped
he stands there staring at them through empty eyes
daniel looks at the door expectantly
he knows the answer before he asks the question
raymonds face fills with sadness
he shakes his
there is a cold silence in the room
daniel stares at the sliding glass door staring out over the city
its not your fault daniel
he looks at them sadly
we had a chance to walk out of zammitos house
we all agreed to it
you had no way of knowing bastaldi was setting us up
i just want to live long enough to get back to paris
just long enough to kill bastaldi
i say we make him pay first
after that you can do whatever you want to him
do you have any idea what van goghs vase with twelve sunflowers is worth
i dont know
its gotta be millions
we still have to get out of here
maybe if we gave the tapes back strongly no
everyone looks to zero
they killed our friend
its personal now
besides if we do that then julien died for nothing
the tapes are the key
the tapes give us leverage with bastaldi
agent hadley sits on his couch deep in thought
he glances at the paper with raymonds phone number on the coffee table
he gets an idea
he picks up his phone and dials
do you speak english
listens you do
listens oh you taught raymond english
you did a wonderful job
im sorry to call so late but im supposed to meet raymond listens no i didnt know he was a difficult child
gayet im calling because listens no i dont have any children of my own
im supposed to meet raymond tonight at his hotel and i forgot what hotel he is at
i wondering if you listens the holiday hotel
thank you very much
tow trucks and cleaning crews work around wreckage of the cars
only a few police cars are there
a uniformed cop looks over and sees joey two tons on the sidewalk
joey motions with his head to an alley
the uniformed cop enters the alley and joins joey
whatd you guys find
the ones in the lincoln are your
and the other car
some french guy
at least thats what his passport said
you know joey i shouldnt be talking to you about this
are you forgetting who supplements your income

are you guys involved in this
ill come down and make a full confession later
right now tell me what else you found
a hotel room card
this sparks joeys interest
the holiday hotel
what room number
i dont know
i didnt look
the crew sits around a table trying to figure out how they can get out of town
airports train stations bus station are out
we know theyre connected to the car rental agencies because thats where they picked up raymond
even if we get out of town and go to another airport im sure the fbi and chicago p
has alerted customs
how about canada
what are we going to do take a taxi
sami opens a pack of cigarettes to find its empty
im going to get some cigarettes
because of the early hour the room is empty
raphael and hector are with freddy o s hard looking
he is wearing a bus boy uniform as he sets the tables
i cant believe someone would have the balls to rip off your ride
when i find them they wont have them for much longer
ill ask around
if they try to move it i can find out
raphael and hector exit
we move with them through the door into
raphael and hector head for the front door
the elevator doors opens and sami exits
they walk past each other as sami heads across the lobby and into the gift shop
as raphael and hector walk out the front door agent hadley steps in walks past them
he goes over to a woman clerk at the front desk
id like to see the manager please
she walks over to the hotel manager and points to agent hadley
the manager walks over
may i help you
agent hadley shows him his badge
im looking for several french men who checked in within the last twenty four hours
they checked in last night
i need you to take me to their room
agent hadley follows the manager as they walks towards the elevators and pass
sami who pretends to read a magazine covering his face so hadley will not see him
sami walks quickly across the lobby and passes
joey two tons nicky the rake and three other wiseguys enter the hotel
agent hadley gets in an elevator with the hotel manager
the doors close as the wiseguys approach
the moment the doors close sami bolts into the lobby and over to the house phones
all of them are being used except one
a man is just about to lift the receiver when sami pushes him aside
i was here first
sami ignores him as he waits for the hotel operator to answer
the phone just rings and rings
behind him another elevator has arrived and the wiseguys enter
samis frustration is growing as the phone continues to ring
the man who sami pushed away is still there
hey buddy you just cant push in here
i most certainly will not go sami quickly smacks him on the head with the receiver
the man slinks away
into phone room
the phone rings
to raymond get that will you
why do i always have to answer the phone
because youre the closest
im not any closer than you are
the wiseguys watch the floor indicator
the phone continues ringing
why is everything an argument with you
im just setting my boundaries
daniel looks at raymond and sighs then gets up and lifts he receiver
get out of the room
youve got company coming up
ill meet you at the chevy
daniel slams down the phone
the others can see the urgency on his face
raymond grab the tapes
why do i have to pick up the tapes
daniel grabs the canvas bag
the manager is about to open the door with his key
agent hadley takes it and removes a gun
you should go now
the manager runs away
agent hadley inserts the key and opens the door
his face fills with fear as he sees
agent hadleys pov daniel marcel raymond and zero are on the other side their guns pointed at hadleys head
daniel uses hadleys handcuffs and handcuffs him to a pipe under the sink
daniel raymond marcel and zero step into the hall
the moment they do the elevator doors at the end of the hall open
the wiseguys step out and see them
the door to the room next to theirs opens and a little girl dressed in a pink dress steps out
calling into her room cmon mommy
everything seems to move in slow motion
the wiseguys go for their guns
the crew goes for theirs
the little girl is caught between both groups
marcel lunges forward tackling the girl to ground
the wiseguys begin to shoot
the hallway fills with gunfire
marcel pulls the little girl into her room
plaster explodes off the walls as bullets rip through them
the crew rushes back into their suite
marcel hands the frightened girl to her mother then moves over to the door that joins with the crews
he shoots the lock and moves through the door
as marcel steps through he sees the crew all aiming their guns at him
daniel gets an idea
as zero holds off the wiseguys from the doorway daniel goes to the adjoining door on the other side of the suite
he shoots off the lock
the crew moves through the door
the crew runs across to the door
because the room is built at the intersection of two hallways the crew step out into a corridor out of the wiseguys line of sight
the crew exits and heads for the staircase
the wiseguys move down the hall and stop outside the door of the crews suite
they rush in
nicky the rake sees the open adjoining door and motions for them to follow him
the wiseguys step out just as the crew are going through the door to the stairwell
the wiseguys run after them
joey two tons lags behind
the crew runs down the stairs
above them the wiseguys follow
joey two tons is breathing heavily as he runs down the stairs
the door flies open as the crew runs across the lot
sami has already started the impala and is waiting for them
a moment later the stairwell door opens and the wiseguys run out guns blazing
the crew heads for the impala shooting behind them as they run
nicky the rake shoots
zero is hit in the leg
he falls to the ground then rolls on his side behind a parked car
he fights through the pain props himself up and begins to shoot back
two wiseguys step out to flank zero
zero takes aim and shoots one
he lines up on the other wiseguy and pulls the trigger again
his gun his empty
daniel and marcel run towards zero firing their guns as fast as they can pull the trigger
marcel takes aim and fires
the wiseguys dive for cover as marcel blazes away until his gun is empty
we hear tires screeching as the impala backs up
the wiseguys shoot blowing out the back window
they move in on marcel and zero
daniel runs forward with two guns firing at the wiseguys
as he nears marcel he throws the extra gun to him
slow motion on the gun as it flies through the air
slow motion one of the wiseguys has almost circle around the car
slow motion on the gun has it flies through the air
real time on marcel he looks to his left just as the gun arrives
it hits him on the forehead and knocks him down
daniel fires a few shots driving the wiseguy back
he runs over and with marcels help they grab zero and help him to the car
they dive into the back seat
the car screeches forward and races out of the garage
the staircase door opens and an exhausted joey two tons steps out gasping for air
daniel attends to the wound on zeros leg
the bullet went clean through
daniel stares at him
zero grins saying thank you
a distraught raphael sits across from hector in a booth near the window
hector has almost finished eating
raphael hasnt touched his food
he pushes his plate away
i cant eat
raphael lowers his head sadly
hector looks out the window
his pov of the impala driving by rear window missing bumper about to fall off
hector watches it go by then turns back
raphael looks up
so can i have your fries
a group of small bungalows built adjacent to the interstate
filled with cheap furniture
a small kitchenette is off to the side of the room
zero lays on the bed
daniel uses his belt as tourniquet to slow the bleeding
raymond sits at the table staring at the black canvas bag containing the cash and tapes
marcel is in the kitchenette
to zero when we get back to paris ill take you dancing
sami enters carrying a shopping bag
he places it on the counter
bring me the scissors
and the vodka
sami removes the items from the bag
he opens the bottle and hands it to zero who quickly gulps down a few mouthfuls
cut his pants up the leg to the groin
and be careful when you get near the top
zero has a very long one
he winks at sami
whats he joking around for
hes been shot
hes been shot a lot
hes used to it
raymond cuts the pant leg away
daniel walks over to marcel who is standing over the gas range
over the flame is a tire wrench the metal tip glowing red hot
sami opens the bag and removes some white bread
whatd you get
some bread and
he removes a can of cheese whiz and sprays the cheese onto the bread
all the french guys look at him as though he is from another planet
in a can
sami stuffs his mouth with a big bite
god i want to go home
hey you know you cant this in france
daniel uses a towel to pick up the tire wrench and walks over to the bed
sami and raymond grimace as they think about whats about to happen
to zero ready
daniel takes the bottle of vodka and pours some over the wound
daniel looks at marcel then releases the belt
blood flows from the wound
marcel presses the hot poker against the wound
zero grunts but does not scream
his face contorts violently from the pain
zammito sits at a table in the back eating an assortment of pasta
dean martin innamaraia plays on the stereo
eddie s arthritic finishes making an espresso
he starts carrying it over to zammito moving incredibly slow shuffling one foot in front of the other
zammito watches him with strained patience
joey two tons and nicky the rake enter
their faces tell the story
they sort of got away
well get back out on the street and find them before i sort of kill you
but we aint had nothing to eat all day boss
oh im sorry
zammito scoops up a handful of pasta out of his plate and throws it at him
joey two tons looks down sheepishly several pieces of pasta are stuck to his face
zammito walks over to him
try to get this through that fat stupid fuckin head of yours
if half tooth tony finds these guys before we do and bonanno knows what was in my safe we are all dead
they turn around and leave
zammito stares after them angrily
he looks over at eddie who is only half way to the table
you gonna bring that over here today or what
zero is passed out a half empty vodka bottle on the nightstand
the others have been up all night
raymond is across the table from sami
the new beaujolais come out in france next week
you like wine
im more of a whiskey drinker myself
glenmorangie is very good
sami realizes that raymond wants to talk about something
that will get his mind of the events that have lead them here
but ill have a glass of beaujolais with you when we get back
raymond forces a weak smile
daniel who has been watching them grabs a few things off the table
ill be back in an hour
daniel looks at sami and motions for him to come outside
sami steps outside
daniel is staring at him
can i trust you sami
hey who warned you that they were coming up to the room
if they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back
that would have left us with nothing
no that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead
you havent answered my question
does it really matter what i say
im leaving you with my friends
im trusting you to do the right thing today
daniel walks up to the front door and rings the bell
half tooth tony opens the door and looks him up and down
i would like to see mr
who the hell are you
tell him im the guy who robbed frankie zammito
half tooth tony searches daniel
he finds a small cassette player glances at it and sticks it back in daniels pocket
points to a door in there
half tooth tony stands behind him his eyes locked on daniels every move
bonanno is sitting in an armchair
either you are incredibly brave or incredibly stupid
which one is it
i guess were going to find out
you rob an associate of mine
a friend and overlapping not such a good friend
may i reach in my pocket
bonanno looks to half tooth tony
daniel removes the cassette player and turns it on
i need an answer from you if im going to move
were not just talkin about a piece of work here frankie
were talking about a boss
bonannos a dinosaur
zammitos voice contd guy thinks hes fuckin vito corleone or something
the old ways are gone
if we dont change now were going to get pushed out
i need to know if i can count on your support
daniel turns off the tape
bonannos anger is visible
ive got to tell you mr
bonanno this guys an idiot
how hes lived this long is a mystery
seething i dont think it will be a mystery much longer
hes recorded every conversation hes had with you for years
i assume you want something
weve got a lot of people looking for us

you want me to help you get out of the country
and for my help i would get what

i know who you are and what you could do to me if i dont honor my word
where are you staying
he isnt going to tell him
i only ask so i can call you when the arrangements are made
how about if i call you
zero and raymond are sleeping
we hear the shower running in the bathroom
sami is at the table
the black canvas bag containing the tapes is on the table
sami removes the identical canvas bag he bought at the store from under the bed and places it on the table
he takes the original and leaves
sami removes the card hadley gave him takes out his cell phone and dials
a taxi pulls up
sami gets in the taxi and it drives away
a moment later another taxi pulls up
daniel gets out
daniel enters to find zero and raymond still sleeping
he looks at the black canvas bag on the table
marcel steps out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel
hadley is waiting by the statue holding a cardboard box
sami walks towards him holding the black canvas bag
what the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night
i thought we had a deal
hey youre not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world
i took a shot
it didnt work
did you bring the tapes
sami holds up the canvas bag
hadley opens the cardboard box to reveal the bloody lamp base
sami hands him the canvas bag
just a second
you must think im a real moron
hadley removes a small cassette player from his jacket
he picks a tape and inserts it into the player
i just came by to tell that piece of work you asked for on johnny wicks its done
howd he go
like the crying rat bastard that he was
hadley stops the tape
he inserts another one
angelo we cant lean too hard on this guy
hes a congressman
i made peter dimiano a congressman
we pay him each month to look after our interests
this is great stuff
he looks up at sami
here you go sport
sami grabs the box and leaves
hadley starts whistling a tune and walks off the other way
as he reaches the tree line lamar pops out with two of his friends
all of them have guns
ill take the bag
you dont think i see through this
you tell sami hes dead
one of lamars guys searches through hadleys pockets finds his gun then takes his wallet
youre making a big mistake
im an fbi agent
hadley stares at lamar defiantly
lamar cocks the hammer back on his gun and presses the barrel to hadleys forehead
hadley drops the canvas bag
lamar picks up the canvas bag and runs away
hadley stands there fuming
lamar runs towards the statue and disappears behind it
daniel is waiting holding the other black canvas bag
as lamar passes they quickly exchange bags
from hadleys point of view lamar has merely run behind the statue as he heads for the street
lamar runs a few more steps then stumbles and falls
several cassette tapes spill out of it
lamars buddies are already at the street
lets get out of here
lamar gets up looks at the bag pretends to be panicked
he runs off leaving the bag laying on the grass
on hadley he cant believe his luck
he runs over picks up the loose cassettes and puts them back in the bag then leaves
on daniel he peers out from behind the fountain watching as hadley walks off in the other direction
daniel arrives to find sami and lamar
see i told you that you could trust me
daniel grins and pats him on the back
okay were square now right
theres just one more thing i need you to do
lamar is about to protest when daniel takes out a roll of bills
daniel and sami sit in the back
daniel is on his cell phone
into phone mr
bonanno i was wondering if you listens that would be fine
hadley enters with the black canvas bag
the receptionist hands him a package
this came for you
hadley opens the package and finds a video cassette
hadley pops the cassette into the vcr
on the screen we see sami speaking into a video camera
since were such good pals i thought id sneak you an advanced copy of my latest work
i call it i am a scum sucking fbi agent
on the television screen we see hadley and sami in the park on their first meeting
you want the tapes for yourself
youre going to sell them
im going to retire with a shit load of money
find me a small country that doesnt have an extradition treaty with the states and live the good life
you didnt have to kill sophie
yes i did
lose ends are messy
the color drains from hadleys face
sami reappears talking into the camera again
its a little arty i know but it has great content dont you think
you were so busy looking for a wire you probably didnt even think about a video camera
it was on the statue
anyway ive sent a copy of the whole tape to the chicago p
and the fbi
theyll get it tomorrow
if i were you id take the day off
the tape turns to static
hadley tries to think
he takes the vhs tape from the machine then picks up his phone and starts to dial a number
he thinks better of it hangs up and uses his cell phone
eddie is on the phone
zammito is at his usual table
hey boss some guy named hadley
says hes got some tapes you want
zammito springs out of his seat and grabs the phone
listens how much
are you nuts
theres an old warehouse on merchant street
zammito and joey two tons rush to the car carrying a briefcase
raymond knocks on the door
vinny answers it his arm in sling
i represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother
i dont know what youre talking about
the person who sent me wishes to help you

vinny looks on the street and sees the impala
a gift you could give to your brother
or anyone you owe money to as partial payment
the papers for the car will arrive tomorrow
an old building dirty windows and peeling paint
the main door is open
zammito and joey two tons are standing next to zammitos lincoln
hadley parks ten yards away and gets out with the black canvas bag

hadley starts to place the canvas bag on the hood of zammitos car
watch the paint
hadley opens the bag
it is filled with cassette tapes
zammito nods to joey two tons who opens another briefcase filled with cash

hadley starts to go
zammito motions him to stop
just a second
zammito picks a tape and tosses it to joey two tons
who puts the cassette into the cars cassette player
suddenly we hear wayne newton singing danke schoen
danke schoen darling danke schoen
thank you for all the joy and pain
hadleys face turns white
he produces an audible gulp as he looks at zammito weakly
the music continues as we hold on a wide shot of the building
pictures show second balcony was the place wed meet
through the dirty windows we see several flashes as the air fills with gunfire
second seat go dutch treat you were so sweet
zammitos lincoln pulls out of the warehouse and drives down the street
music continues in the cassette deck
joey two tons drives
zammito sits in the passenger seat

sami marcel and raymond help zero out of the taxi and towards a small plane
off to the side bonanno is standing with half tooth tony
daniel walks over to him

daniel hands him the cassette case with half the tapes
bonanno hands it to half tooth tony who takes them into the car and listens to a tape
theyre good boss
and the other half of the tapes

the lincoln pulls up
zammito and joey two tons get out
vinny is waiting beside the impala

vinny starts to walk away
yelling after him hey if youre well enough to be walking around youre well enough to start working here
a gang hang out
raphael is with several hard looking gang bangers
lamar arrives with two of his friends
dont come off like a hard on with me
im about to make you a very happy man
several gang bangers stand around their low rider cars
sanantas oye como va plays loudly on one of the radios
raphael talks heatedly with several of the gang bangers
music continues as several gang members check their guns
the santana song continues as several car loads of gang bangers drive down the street
the air is thick with cigar smoke
several gumbas hang around the bar
zammito is at his table with joey two tons and nicky the rake
dean martin return to me plays on the jukebox
outside we hear the sound of cars pulling up and screeching to a stop
the door opens and raphael and ten other very tough looking gang members step inside
the room falls silent except for dino on the jukebox
zammito stands up
anybody know about that car outside
the hell it is
im telling you thats my car
and someones gonna pay for it
and im tellin you it aint
now turn your taco eating ass around and get the hell out of here
fuck you grease ball
they are right on the edge of having a major disaster
the dean martin song ends
each group watches the other to see whos going to make the first move
the jukebox selects another record
the needle scratches against the vinyl intro
we hear the intro to jerry vale singing amore scusami
raphaels eyes burn into zammitos a gang bangers eyes dart from side to side
a wiseguy bites his lip
nicky the rake twitches his fingers nervously
sweat glistens on the forehead of joey two tons
at the bar eddie reaches behind for something without looking
he knocks over a bottle
it falls to the floor and breaks
the noise is enough to push things over the edge
my love forgive me
raphael goes for his gun
all hell breaks loose
people dive for cover as shots rings out
in the close quarters its like shooting fish in a barrel
i didnt mean to have it end like this
eddie lifts a shotgun from behind the bar and blows away a gang member
another gang member kills him
its a massacre
bodies drop like flies
the room is so thick with smoke you cant see two feet in front of you
finally it is quiet
i didnt mean to have you fall in love in love with me
we move through the room past the carnage
smoke swirls blood covers the floor
raphael is dead
along with joey two tons and nicky the rake on the floor zammito is against the bar
he sits up amazed that he is untouched
he gets to his feet and makes his way to the front door
zammito staggers outside and into the street
he laughs a nervous laugh at his good fortune
my love please kiss me
zammito turns around to see zammitos pov a lincoln town car speeding towards him
through the windshield he can see the smiling face of half tooth tony
the front of the car slams into zammito lifting him into the air
he flips head over heals then smashes into the windshield and over the car
he lays in the middle of the street dead
the lincoln speeds off down the street
arrivederci amore kiss me
bonanno sits on his couch eating a cannoli as he watches judge judy on television
remember when we part
agent hadley is leaning against his car his eyes open a large bullet hole in his head
youll have my heart
wayne is sitting on the couch an open package on the coffee table
he smiles as he stares at the stacks of cash the crew took from zammito
the crew sits quietly
i love you so
jerry vale continues singing as the plane glides through a clear blue sky
bastaldi steps outside into the crisp morning air
he takes a few steps then stops
bastaldi pov across the street standing side by side are daniel sami raymond marcel and zero
they look like a ragged bunch tired dirty
we pan across the faces of each one of them as they stare at bastaldi
a bus goes by blocking bastaldis view of the boys
when it passes the crew it gone
bastaldi bites his lip nervously
bastaldi looks around but there is no sign of them
we can see the five of them crouched behind a parked car
marcel peers through the window at bastaldi who is still trying to figure out where they went
they are all amused with bastaldis bewilderment
whats he doing
hes looking around for us
zero cant stay like this much longer
his leg is hurting
finally bastaldi turns around and goes back into his apartment
bastaldi is at his desk nervously tapping his fingers on the surface
the phone rings
he knows who is calling
he stares at the phone for a long moment then he slowly lifts the receiver
in french its daniel
in french daniel
listen im afraid there has been a big overlapping in french ive got the tapes
if you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what i say

in french i dont have it
thats why vincent went to chicago
they arrested him before he could bring it back
in french well you better get the money somehow

the line goes dead
bastaldi drives up
he gets out carrying a suitcase and nervously walks to the boat
no one appears to be there
bastaldis cell phone rings
he answers it
in french go back on deck
theres a small rowboat in the water daniel sami and zero watch the houseboat
daniel continues his conversation on the cell phone
in french put the money in the rowboat and untie it
the current will carry it down river
when we see that the money is there ill call back and tell you where the tapes are
daniels pov bastaldi appears on deck
he puts the suitcase in the rowboat and unties it
it drifts slowly into the current
the rowboat hugs the shore moving slowly down the river
marcel is on the shore with raymond
raymond reaches out with a long pole and pulls the boat to shore
marcel opens the case
inside are several stacks of five hundred franc notes
marcel looks to raymond with a grin and nods
raymond opens his cell phone
daniel sami and zero continue to watch the houseboat
samis cell phone rings
he answers it and listens
were in business
sami nods to daniel
bastaldis cell phone rings
he answers it
in french go down into the main cabin
the tapes are in the wooden chest
the line goes dead
bastaldi enters looks around the room until he sees the wooden chest
he walks over and opens it
inside there are several cassette tapes in the cardboard box
bastaldi grins and lifts the cardboard box out of the chest
he hears a click
he notices something is attached to the bottom of the cardboard box
its a long thin wire that has pulled the pin on an electronic device
daniel is now holding small black device
a yellow light starts flashing
he puts his finger on a red button
this is for julien
he presses the button
a digital counter begins counting backwards
bastaldi realizes that the device is a bomb
he stares at the numbers quickly speed by
the houseboat explodes in a brilliant fireball sending pieces of wood and metal flying into the air
a thick plume of black smoke swirls in the wind
daniel raymond sami raymond marcel and zero watch the smoldering wreckage
their blank faces show no emotion just a sense that justice has been done
did you have to use that much explosive
i promised bonanno id destroy the tapes
raymond opens the suitcase and looks inside
as he peels through the stacks of money we see that only the top bill of each stack is real underneath them all is white paper cut to the same
size as the bills
everyone turns to marcel
you didnt check it
the five of them walk across the bridge
i was caught up in the excitement of the moment
i should have checked
i made a mistake
i suppose that none of you have ever made a mistake before
no one answers him
sami reaches inside the black canvas bag and removes the autographed baseball marcel took from zammito
this is great
after everything weve been through weve got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball
the baseball is mine
you cant have the baseball
youre not entitled to the fuckin baseball
sami throws the baseball back in the canvas bag
im the one who took it
its my baseball
if you say baseball one more time zero will shoot you
raymond dont you think theyre over reacting a little
i think they have a right to express their anger with you in light of the fact that youre
something in him snaps raymonds anger takes everyone by surprise
even raymond is surprised by his outburst
all of you want to be angry
but im the one who took the ball and that makes it mine
give it to me sami
marcel tries to take the ball out of the bag
sami pulls it away
marcel grabs the bag
both of them tug on it
marcel pulls hard and the bag rips down the seam
the baseball falls out and rolls off the bridge into the river
marcel stands there holding the inside liner of the bag
sami throws the canvas bag to the ground in frustration
something catches daniels attention
daniels pov of the black canvas
the lining has been ripped away
a light breeze blows lifting the underside of the black canvas
there is a flash of color
another gust of wind turns the black canvas over
on the other side is van goghs vase with twelve sunflowers
daniels jaw drops
the others notice his stunned expression and follow his stare
their pov of the priceless painting
they stand there too shocked to move at first then rush forward
they have almost reached the painting when a truck passes them
the wind kicks up the painting blowing it over the railing
they reach out to grab it but it is too far away
they stand there watching as it slowly floats down to the river below
they look at one an other then without speaking a word they all jump off the bridge
as they fall towards the water we
