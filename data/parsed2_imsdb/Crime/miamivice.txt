written by michael mann based on miami vice created by anthony yerkovich first draft wgaw we are at the delicate interface between ocean and air
liquid and gas
the event horizon where molecules evaporate
this interchange is ethereal
then low frequencies rumble through depths
and the ocean surface is torn by a foot catamaran and the roar of horsepower rocketing at us at knots
has a canopy low like a b bomber and extends a half mile
it launches off two foot swells goes airborne pushes to knots with another rpm left
pilots the born to win in full helmet
on the throttle and flaps is ricardo tubbs
leads the frontrunners towards a finish line demarcated by a couple of million yachts loaded with media
at the last moment occurs a small power loss and born to win gets nosed into second place by the foot skater goddess
thunders to the dock throttled down at low revs
the canopy is up
crockett and tubbs helmets are off
dockhands tie it off
its the same crowd you catch at a grand prix nine figure money tall northern italian women and minor german princesses with swiss educations no bimbos and no questions about
the exception is born to wins sponsor a blonde dreadlocked bearded switek
he looks like a dot com entrepreneur who got out in time
next to him is a blonde ukranian lady with high cheekbones
well see her again
in second position to the japanese driver and throttle man of goddess neither of whom speak english
the boat bicardi silver was driven by david scott and throttled by john tomlinson
leave the winning circle among asian and mexican billionaires
as the small crowd breaks up
named nicholas in vuarnet wraparounds and buzz cut white hair glides by
low burnett whats crackin
maxin and relaxin
doesnt believe them sure
change your mind get inclined
let me know
whatever nicholas is soliciting crockett and tubbs dont want
nicholas brokers go fast runs moving loads from offshore into south florida
among guys who pilot offshore race boats there are one or two whove never run a load but no ones found them yet
a couple hundred thousand dollars worth of granite and steel
off screen a restaurant grade sub zero opens with a hiss
beyond the kitchen we see through a dining room to a den
a chair is overturned
we hear muffled sounds
we see feet extend through a door jamb
someones on the floor
a television is playing distantly
so close they almost come to life
a venezuelan family two boys and a girl in a pool
maria alonzo the two boys at their sisters baptism
and we see holding the baby daughter is riccardo tubbs
a family dinner at a south american restaurant
tubbs sits with the youngest daughter on his lap
maria is on the other side of him
this is the image that almost comes to life
we hear the vivacious latin ambience late on a sunday afternoon when families take the grandparents and have dinner
move from the bright glare of the interior onto the broad neck of a man
a viking is tattooed there
the image morphs into a naked woman presenting her rear to a muscled biker next to a chopper above a swastika residing between shoulder blades
ss lightning bolts are on his neck
pull back from this man who is bent into the frig because hes hungry
his head is shaved and hes naked from the waist up
a black hefty garbage bag is tied around his waist
yellow industrial gloves are on his hands
something bad is happening in this house
its a sikorski skimming across the water of biscayne bay on a moonlit night at living room level past stilt houses
pilots the chopper past the brightly lit windows of high rise collins avenue condos for the fugitive rich
and heads towards the macarthur causeway
whats our deal
backup in case the russians get physical
how luckys miss universe gotta be
skin has to touch skin
thats the requirement for the warrant
then he makes a credible excuse and he stops
beat her crew blackmailed and asset stripped the last mark down to his social security
in the back her long copper legs stretched out under a short skirt is gina calabrese
this i gotta see
beat the make up an excuse and stop part
i have faith
in horoscopes and fortune cookies
switek pulling this off
thats not faith thats delusional
wearing enough of nothing to hide the micro
which gina checks right now
theres a round in the chamber
aerial the sikorski crosses past the stacks of million condos to a landing pad on a roof
the miami of the s that twilight zone frontier built on coke fueled cash flow is over
the frontier development stage is passed
it has become casablanca
anything goes everything has a price
the chopper rockets in settles
crockett tubbs and gina descend to the th floor penthouse the target
as crockett and tubbs continue down to she looks over her shoulder at tubbs
two surveillance technicians rick and frank are glued to a monitor showing a bedroom in which nothing happens
castillo is there out of a past somewhere between cia and the jesuits
referring to the monitor on which there are no people in an they are watching air move
this is exciting
thats cause nothing is happening
it goes past him yeah
this is their surveillance
how they video their marks
see we jacked their fiber optics like we piggybacked their signal
they exit to
are met at the door by security who recognizes them and are welcomed by their host ugo
this is the baccardi cup after party
the same players from the marina
enter an square foot penthouse
offshore racer types players so bee models
runnin the biscayne
crockett wanders off
if a coupla new exhaust manifolds show up
approaches a bar and female bartender
gin and tonic
plymouth or boodles
scandinavian accent lemon or lime
lemon doesnt go in gin and tonics darlin
where ya from
leaning in gottingen
thats in sweden
you in miami workin on your complexion
shes beautifully bronzed
i was in namibia
with the united nations high commission on refugees
ginas listening on her personal comms
i did refugee relocation in somalia
but they transferred me out after i was wounded
gina rolls her eyes as she crosses by tubbs
only african he ever relocated was a an hour nigerian model for gucci and he got wounded when she took an nba draft choice to the super bowl instead of
he did volunteer one time
entering for a massage parlor bust
beat why am i here
trudy joplin is a tall african american
she whispers into a small mic
if you looked closely shes ripped
as if steel cables moved under her smooth skin
she slides past tubbs and gina
low to backup switek
but only if it gets lethal
because you cannot kill him
all white bling is arguing with his blade thin glassy eyed adrenaline junkie partner zito
approaching is miss ukraine
high cheekbones suggest one of genghis khans horsemen found her maternal ancestor as attractive as switek finds her
tubbs clocks three beefy russians in a corner one is unusually fit
and theres dmitri
the honey trap
and theres the honey
hello miss ukraine
miss ukraine brings switek his glass of champagne
she whispers something in his ear
and is led towards a back bedroom
gina ambles over
to crockett eleven to seven he blows it
whispers twenty on my man
youre giving away your money fool
tubbs opens his moto as if hes about to make a call
trudy looks over his shoulder
what we see is the feed from the monitor in the surveillance room downstairs
two blonde people starting to get naked
switek and miss ukraine
a second call comes in
tubbs ignores it
to zito you bet your partner
switek versus primal impulse from the amygdala
higher thinking versus the lizard brain
tectonic plates of libido confront the cognitive
she cops his joint
he pushes the button
whats so fucking difficult
crocketts cell phone rings
he separates from the group
on the phone
im sorry sonny
hes come outside to hear better
in the background gina shakes her head about switek
he blew it
trudy looks at crockett and sees crocketts focused hearing
who is this
hes cruising at
hes floating in a magnolia leather interior
but its bloodstained from his nose and mouth
hes been beaten
his white shirt is torn
he doesnt care
voice cracks its fucked up
recognizing him alonzo
beat what are you talking about
where are you
they had me from the gate
i dont understand
he catches tubbs eye and waves him outside
i gave up nothing on you guys

they had me from the gate
whatever you can do for them
breaks look what i did to them sonny
crocketts phone goes dead

i am trying to alert you here
beat you know whether or not

beat but we know this guy
i think you know this guy
normally he is cool
tonight he is distraught
that is atypical
that engenders foreboding
do you understand the meaning of the word foreboding
as in badness is happening to your deal right fucking now
rusting marine parts and corrugated metal fall into weeds next on a channel of the indian river
it cuts through inner city miami
in low light are strapping up
kevlar vests go over tattooed arms and chests
glimpses of swastikas
handguns in waistbands
smgs small machine guns slung from shoulders over white shirts business suit jackets
everybody wears surgical gloves
shoes are industrial
one carries a very long rifle with a flash suppressor
it is a bolt action
is a second aryan brother sniper team with an identical weapon aimed at an empty lot a thousand yards away across the indian river
two suburbans and an escalade pull out
caribbean freighters seized by us customs rust at the bank
two cadillacs are parked
a door opens
an interior light comes on
two russian slickster types
one looks at a watch
the other triggers his cell phone
a meeting is imminent
empty except for the fbi agent in a sweatsuit carrying files as if he stopped by when crocketts call came in
hes on a computer
he picks up the phone
guys involved in a meet
buy and walk
buy and bust
meet and greet
i flash you some of mine you flash me some of yours
and the deal goes down at another place at another time
so theres no industrial strength hrt weapons team out there tonight
crockett puts his nextel on speaker so tubbs can hear too
into phone haitian dominican russian israeli
white supremacist types
omgs mongols nazi low riders prison gangs
nlr we think
i wanna know
sarcastic oh good
what else what else did he indicate to you
i need to know everything he said
he is saying they had him from the gate
he is saying to my partner and i and to his family goodbye
what does that tell you
in the back seat get lucky
the pilot reacts as the technician in the copilot seat has picked up a signal from the firefly
on alonzos bentley
keys radio too much static tries cell phone sonny we got him
tubbs pilots it while crockett gets the location of alonzos car and repeats it into the headset to tubbs as the
banks hard left and heads for north towards lauderdale
three aryan brothers in business suits get out of the rear of the escalade and suburban with a driver in each
our two russians approach from their cadillac with a backup cadillac and one driver on the other side
closer aryan brothers
hip hop culture has invaded white supremacist gangs
a couple of diamond earrings
sample now is okay
and we want sample load when we do deal
what inventory you can supply
glass ice ks es mitsus ames ex
whatever you need
and colombian h
but give us a heads up
the aryan brother pops him a couple of vials
aryan brother contd ice
spectra analyze that shit
and party on with the coke
you are looking at ninety two percent pure
none of that jumped on powder they sell up in new yorioo
beat now lets see the green
one of the russians puts his hand on a weapon as the other opens up a nike sports bag
never seen money before
this is called money
aryan brother reaches into the bag at the wrapped stacks of hundreds
flips through a couple takes one or two at random
russian nods for him to go ahead
you got lotsa green
we got all the goodies
larryll call you in the am and talk money quantity time and place
everybody goes back to their cars
as the two russians get into theirs aryan brother turns from the running board of the escalade with his drivers door open
i forgot to ask you something my brother
he looks at his partner and nods who says something into a nextel
aryan brother contd they have a decent death benefit program in the fbi
for the russians in the car time freezes
as they start to react theyre blown up by
caliber rounds from the two sniper positions
caliber rounds go right through car bodies sheet metal upholstery glass human flesh bone more upholstery and metal and out the other end
another round goes through the passenger door through the passenger through the driver out the driver door and into the night
the three aryan brothers approach the steaming cars with the chopped up occupants and take the gym bag full of cash
the escalade driver dons night vision goggles
they load up and drive off as we hear the thump thump of air support and some distant sirens
at knots watching a thermographic image of alonzo stevens car on a monitor weave through traffic northbound on the
see tubbs sikorsky beyond switek zito as it swoops from a higher altitude right past the miami dade chopper banks and dives for the freeway
tracking with stevens bentley from the front
the black sikorsky is almost on the bentleys hood
tubbs racks the chopper sideways so that alonzo can see crockett in the copilot seat
has his handgun out and is waving alonzo over to the shoulder
tubbs keeps the chopper almost blocking alonzos bentley
alonzo pulls over
tubbs wheels around and lands on the shoulder
exits the bentley and walks toward crockett and tubbs
he holds his hand out to keep them at a distance
freeway traffic roars past
crockett and tubbs dont get too close heeding alonzos warning
incensed over traffic noise what the hell did you do
the feeb gig was i front a coupla undercover russian speakers to them
and broker the deal
set up the meet with the nlr types
stevens takes a low resolution e mailed image from his pocket and hands it to tubbs
tubbs looks up shocked hands it to crockett
stevens head rotates loosely on his shoulders
his minds elsewhere
alonzos wife francine is bound clothes torn to a chair in a tv room
on the floor are two young boys bound with plastic ties
paper bags are over their heads
francines eyes are as large as saucers
around her neck is a necklace of c explosive connected to a detonator
stevens contd shouts so i gave them up man
gave up the feds
gave up everything i knew
now i got to go home
howd they get onto you
how do i know
but it was from the get go
knew the fbi had run me into them
beat sonny i gotta go
and a miami pd swat team crash through the front door
another team through the back
trudy in a tactical vest is second in with a gauge
the house is empty
gina and other detectives hang in the rear
first swat team clears the living room dining room
second clears the kitchen maids quarters
last room to clear
center of the house
swat teams appear around corners
the looks on their faces tell us nobody is here
and what they see gives even these veterans pause as blood pools around the legs of a family and overturned chairs
alonzo didnt save anyone
after changing channel hello sonny
on police radio listens to a message from trudy while
to tubbs i gotta i gotta go
voice cracks alonzo you dont need to go home
now alonzo knows
they said they wouldnt hurt them wouldnt hurt them if
they been known to do that
alonzo stevens has a strange look in his eyes
he looks at crockett and tubbs as if to say something
crockett and tubbs walk towards him to reach him
to console him
looks at them sadly
and before they can stop him he steps out onto the freeway opens his arms and embraces the front bumper of a m
grim silent race through miami traffic to the crime scene we know is ahead because
over tubbs shoulder we see all the lights from two dozen emergency vehicles a quarter mile ahead
death is not procedural or casual not when its somebody you know like an informant you worked cases with
cell phone rings
whats your twenty
quarter mile away
we see the lights
taking cell we know these people
in a concrete space
weve entered mid scene
were not certain
you said nazi low riders
were not certain
we think nlr
we dont know
alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet
he wasnt deep into the crew
it doesnt track
white gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park
bounce around the old lady saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back
this is a distribution network out of south florida moving poly drug loads crystal meth through coke to nashville atlanta memphis cleveland
and computer fraud identity theft
its like that
to the point tell them what you want
they knew about alonzo before he made a move on them
they had our operation
theyve cut into us
we dont know
break your encryption
hack your e mail
somebody on the inside
we dont know
and thats the point
maybe theres a mole
whatever its a disaster
and its a joint interagency task force
i have dea atf u
customs components in on it
so the penetration could be from any one agency
what we do know is i have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions cause i have to assume our operational security is blown
as in your ass is dead in the water
but miami pd wasnt part of the j
and from what alonzo said he didnt give you up
so what do you want
to recruit you
i didnt want you around the crime scene because its crawling with federal law enforcement
we dont know whos straight up whos not
recruit us to do what
get into business with this crew identify them
illuminate their network
if youre lucky discover their source how they penetrated us
well indict and take it from there
how do we do that
make a buy
wry that went well
we supply to them
they got a steady stream of supply
a colombian producer
named archangel de jesus montoya londono
never heard of him
from the north valle area
low level we think
aryan brothers are not going to change up suppliers
how they bringing the loads in
they collect in miami
montoya the producer handles deliveries
thats his end and he varies the routes
we got some flir off an awac of a coupla go fast boats on one run thats all
fujima boots up his military spec laptop to view the flir video
track with me here
beat they knew the russians were undercover feeb
they should have no showed
but no these guys show anyway and commit murder upon federal officers
and steal all your money
beat to fujima what does that say to you
speculating it says we do not fear you
to fujima it says fuck off and die
it says we get down for recreation
fujimas dell laptop glows to life
two almost indistinguishable boats and their wakes are seen
crockett contd blow that up
crocketts attention goes to something atypical he spots about the wake emerging behind each boat
he exchanges a look with tubbs
but they say nothing
to crockett so
we could try to run loads into these guys
to fujima run a few loads for montoya into south florida
into this group
you need to consider a few issues
to crockett tubbs youd be operating outside territorial united states
your badges do not count
you have no authorization to carry weapons
if youre busted it could take a long time to get you re patriated
and theres no backup
to fujima and you will share with them all your intel on montoya
i mean full disclosure
from my side i dont want to know anything about what youre doing or how you do it
to castillo so let me know if were on
castillo waits until fujimas car pulls away
to tubbs about the stevens family im sorry
i know you were close to them
i was the kids godfather
i got to know
there is never any room for personal
for tubbs he is fine
and we know the jokes
when it gets vengeful things get messy
when they get messy the wrong people die
beat everybody gets it
and the answer is yes
beat before she met alonzo once upon a time a long time ago
beat you bet it was personal
and is now compartmentalized in the past
to crockett whatd you spot
three wakes off the back of those boats
who runs three sterling engines off a deep v hull
he any good
so whats gonna persuade montoya to change off sal maguda running his deliveries
its a rhetorical question
theyre two feet out of the water on their dry dock next to a marine shed
its an unlikely location because derelict factories cheap apartments weeds and marine scrap metal are the neighborhood
and a swat team in the weeds across the river
they include sgt
jean louis bastide a haitian in dark sweats
they all are in plain clothes
odile she say theyre pregnant
we dont know what that means yet
only jean louis and i do the talking
both steel doors explode as if their molecular structure itself disintegrated from one blast of tubbs m grenade launcher firing a canister of ball bearings like a king size shotgun
on steroids as
react but crockett draws down on one with an ak
bastide wounds the second guard who had drawn down his h k
a third guard begs to live in french patois
they own the place
and crockett sees
individually wrapped bricks of north valle colombian cocaine are on a table
comme on dit
like they said
charger et les recoit dici
load em up and get out of here
que fais tu
que faisons nous
de qua t il lair fou
nous voulons tous votre drugs
what are we doing
whats it look like were doing fool
we are stealing all your dope
suburban crashes through the wreckage of the door and backs to the table
jean louis and swat start throwing bricks into the back
tubbs with crockett exit
approach the two deep v hull go fast boats with three engines off the back
tubbs cracks the breech of the grenade launcher and loads a millimeter shell while he strolls down the dock
tosses two willie peters white phosphorus grenades into the boats
tubbs fires the m at a third boat which explodes flame followed by
destroy the smugglers strykers which we saw in fujimas video
crockett tubbs have just put sal maguda out of business
they walk away and around the side of the shed disregarding the curious citizens of little haiti come to watch the fireworks
crockett reaches into a paper bag full of cell phones and grabs one
he dials up a number grabs another and hands it to tubbs
in the phone hey sailor
pause yeah im good
beat got a hole in the calendar
looking to charge up the cash flow
waits yeah later
crockett struck out
into phone hey nicholas my ace
into phone we got idle all of an instant
you got something from somewhere thats got to go someplace somewhen which is not too distantly in the future
the guy with the white hair
it is fortuitous that you called
corrosion and decay
people look coldly at us
malevolence and malefaction on every corner
no ones picked up the garbage for a month
poverty in the caribbean half light
cross the street to camera from their rental car
the la perla section was a th century haven for pirates
its had little civic improvements in years
they enter a nightclub shabby neon
there are no customers
men stop them and frisk them
they expected that
were from nicholas to meet jose
theyre waved to the rear
they start towards a back table
a small group of people wait
hes a former right wing colombian paramilitary from the north valle near the pacific coast
he runs operations communications and security
he has cold eyes and a corpulent face
hes notorious for using torture to ferret out informants
right now he watches these two americans approach
security people are on either side of him
extends hand jose
this is my partner rico
as crockett sits he notices that at a table a few to the side is a woman
this is isabella
behind glasses she seems immobile filled with intelligence well dressed in subdued tom ford and staring at him
crockett holds the look that extra beat and turns back to business
to security dos cafe
hes security not a fucking waiter
but yero nods
security fetches coffee anyway
so lay it out my brother
nicholas said you okay
but how i know if you any good
who you run loads for
cause other than nicholas you knows you
tubbs looks at crockett
they thought it was a done deal
dark my mommy and daddy know me
isabella tilts her head imperceptibly
and we didnt come down here to audition
business auditions for us
beat and know who we are and know they want their load run by us before nicholas calls
that way we do not waste avgas or our motherfucking time
yeros security reacts to the tone and raises weapons
a few start up out of their chair as
appear at the door smgs from shoulder straps
zito flips a d hand grenade which crockett snatches out of the air pulls the pin and slams on the table
only crocketts hand pressure restrains the clip
crockett contd goes right up in yeros face you want to know shit
who the fuck are you
you got a side deal with u
customs to open up the coast in a few spots
in exchange you flip them some gringo runners
you wearing a wire
tubbs rips open yeros shirt
open to the waist
yeros people have weapons pointed their way
they outnumber switek and zito
slacks taken up on triggers
its on the edge
and the edge is overloaded
tubbs reads that warns yero
people gonna walk into this place and say ola hijo
that some crazy wallpaper
is that a jackson pollack
that was jose yero splattered all over his motherfucking wall
so we can close each others eyes right now
pause but then nobody makes any money
yero gestures his security to calm down
crockett and tubbs still hold the grenades
then crockett opens his shirt
so does tubbs
slow and low adam a s
yero looks quizzical carbon composite stealthy nautical mile range thousand ki payload
all the way to caravels and s from a source country to a transshipment point
weve done containers
and specialize in very fast go fast boats for coastal runs
what kind of weight
we dont talk weight
we talk logistics
isabella sits watching this
she drinks her coffee
jose yero contd you get longs and lats for the pickup
you run it in
on shore our people receive the loads
interrupts the people on shore who handle a load we run are our people not your people
no tweakers dopers first timers we dont know
they didnt do time with us they aint doing crime with us
what you get from us is a date
in the parking lot of a jack in the box in north miami
at such and such time an eighteen wheeler will be there
keys in the ignition
ready to roll
you pick it up
and you drive it
waves his left hand away
money thing is done in advance in places where there are no guns
because when money and guns get together there is violence
you afraid of violence
i am not john wayne
there is no s on his chest
we get down if the play calls for it
but we are into business and making money
and violence is extra
so how much weight you looking to move
cause how you do delivery on the beach i dont like
maybe this does not work
then it dont work
what happened to the last transporter you had
what do you care
to crockett do we need this
rises red light green light jose
doesnt answer leans back im also called cochi loco
that means crazy pig
cause i enforce security and get people to tell me what i need to know
that part of what i do you never want to find out about
pause other people will negotiate the money and go or not go
then what were we talking to you for
i had to lay eyes on you
isabella watches crockett
to tubbs you seem okay
to tubbs re crockett but him
i dont like
how he looks
everything goes from tense to lethal
has yero made them
what do i care what you think about how he looks
you wanna fuck my partner or do business
wait by the phone
pause you get a call
or maybe you dont
until then piss off back to where you come from
crockett flips the hand grenade and catches it with his left hand
and he drops it in front of jose yero
it spins on the table
he had reinserted the pin
and they back out
offscreen a door opens
entering is gina calabrese
she washes his back
she dumps too much shampoo on his head
he tries to clear it from his eyes
they start to make love under the water in the steam through the misted glass offscreen we hear an engine rumble
sonny can wait
tubbs and gina are not random lovers theyre in love
the look in her eyes the openness is pure femininity behind the bronx presentation
she smiles touches the side of his face
ties up a sun seeker
it looks like a deep v offshore racer on growth hormones
crocketts alone as dusk fades over the s ranch house on the river
its under tropical trees with one strip of white neon utility lighting outlining the flat eave
let himself in
hes at a kitchen stool at the counter when tubbs enters in sweats
gina enters in a robe
beat hi gina
putting shopping bag on table this is from frick and frack
re bag what do we got
crockett pulls out three overly large cell phones
supposedly sharper than the g
to gina how goods our background
tubbs and crockett look at the mac screen as gina boots it up
ginas fingers tap dance on the keyboard
youre so not the pd if you got busted on a dui youre in serious trouble
youre bad men back to grammar school
to tubbs san quentin
to crockett marine corps
pelican bay where you guys hooked up
now youre too smart and too fast to get jacked again
how will it stand up
if they ran the rental car or lease on this place
even if its epic database in el paso
theyd have to work through the layers of bullshit three weeks deep
then theyd find your deeper hidden criminal selves
no ones watching it
tubbs eyes are wide open staring
crocketts hand grabs it
its the summons from jose yero
lazily what am i supposed to do after i get my nails and hair done
reality tv and stay by the phone
thats what all wives in crime do
he leans over and kisses her
she holds firmly the back of his neck and looks into his eyes
you hear me
he winks at her in assurance and hes gone
her lazy smile drops off
shes not so sure he will be
crockett in the copilot seat
switek and zito are in the back barely awake
zito hands out coffee
switeks stashing weapons behind the fuselage upholstery
tubbs is clearing us air space as we
rockets through cumulonimbus against a black sky up to feet
where we meeting em
port au prince
touches down drives towards us
turns towards commercial aviation facility
switek and zito emerge to rental cars with two car rental clerks waiting
crockett and tubbs make a careful entry
hands on weapons carrying bags
what do we got
we see tradecraft
they clear the room
they check for bugs and external surveillance
they pull curtains
tubbs from a bag pulls a scanner
under the two beds
behind the picture
traps the room to reveal if it had been searched while they were gone
he aligns the suitcase perfectly parallel on the bench
a matchstick goes against the closed closet door
a ballpoint pen is leaned against the telephone
tubbs contd show time
from his bag tubbs pulls a smith wesson j frame hammerless in
he holsters this on his ankle
a remington shotgun with pistol grip sawed off to a inch barrel gets slung on a bungee cord shoulder strap under his right arm
mm under his shirt in his waistband and two spare magazines clipped to his belt
race gun with rounded sights and a magna ported barrel cross drawn and a blunt
para ordnance in the small of his back
crockett traps that door too with a small piece of tape
all of it tells us that where they are and where theyre going is a high wire act without a net
their badges dont work
there is no law there is no order
they are in a state of nature where people get killed for their shoes
shadows on white limestone monuments
and nothing happens
they watching us watching them watching us waiting for them
still apprehensive concluding theyre victims of a no show
approach their door
the tape trap is torn
weapons appear in their hands
someones been here
then they relax
they need not have bothered being so careful about detecting a clandestine surveillance
the room is overtly destroyed
not one piece of furniture is unbroken
walls have been opened
their stuffs strewn all over
haitian paramilitary in soccer jerseys and shorts with assault rifles
aks are aimed at crockett and tubbs heads
and his para ordnance are in each hand
tubbs shotgun is aimed at the front door his
mm at the men streaming in the windows
a womans voice
to crockett put your guns on the table
enters sits if we wanted you dead you would no longer be drawing breath in miami
we wouldnt have brought you all the way here
so what is this a party
crockett tubbs put down their weapons
well have room service wipe up the furniture
and bring drinks
isabella says something in french
the cops ease up
isabellas personal security frisks crockett tubbs and remain
glad we came
this place is a lot of fun if youre doctors without borders
isabella takes off her glasses
shes afro cuban
i run down the numbers
nothing is very negotiable
we pay three thousand a ki
we pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent
the next ten percent on u
two three thousand a ki
two thousand kis your end is
beat complex transshipments or dealing with containers these have front loaded costs we pickup
beat for this kind of weight the balance of is when our buyer picks up the load
beat transactions are offshore
dollars or euros
secure internet transfers
we have lists of cayman and isle of man banks infiltrated by irs to be avoided
beat no transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on u
beat thats the deal
i thought we had to meet the man
as she leaves
in the back seat on a rural road
isabella is not with them
one of her russians is
in the front seat his smg is ready his eyes never leave crockett and tubbs
a military hummer in the front carries isabella with her security
behind is a crew cab with bench seats loaded with haitian paramilitary
they approach a town
he nudges crockett
a police roadblocks ahead
has seen something else
he indicates the pager on his waist
thats whats surprising
tubbs pulls his cell phone
meanwhile theyre slowing down for the police roadblock
crockett gets tense
his cells signal strength indicator steps down to zero
stop the caravan
is this turning bad
check under the vehicles with mirrors
see all the weapons
usher the convoy past
exchange a look
then they get it
the cops work as security for the narcotrafficker
the caravan advances towards a major intersection
this one is blocked off by haitian military
is snatched open
haitian soldiers search crockett and tubbs
they defer to the russian speaking security
mercedes pulls forward
eyes his pager tubbs his cell phone no signal in an urban area
blocking signal traffic is something the cia does over baghdad
its not supposed to be happening in haiti on a dope deal
see a third circle of security approach
carrying automatic weapons some more casually dressed some with night vision goggles
the vehicles stop
crockett and tubbs are directed to get out
theyre pushed around and searched
a working class glaswegion scot a couple of brits are off to the side with short hair and shoulders that are too deep and faces like rugby players ex sas
russians are ex kgb
languages overheard smatterings of russian hebrew and english
crockett and tubbs look at each other they get it
this is the cream of private sector security
and it says top dollar infrastructure
four avenues lead in
each avenue is blocked
the square is closed down to vehicles and pedestrians
locals have disappeared
in the center of the square are four matching gestures to tubbs to look up
with night vision goggles
cross through a no mans land
it feels like being in the open in kosovo
checks out the first suburbans uplink satellite dish on a hydraulic mast
the rears converted into computer equipment sitting in ruggedized racks
the interior has been converted into a luxurious limo like office with swivel seats
isabella followed by crockett and tubbs enter
its occupied by archangel de jesus montoya londono
hes not flashy
he has smooth skin slightly opalescent black eyes
his right arm is normal length but shriveled
please take that seat on the side
polite friendly excuse me because i am very busy and have many things to do so this will be brief
beat not waiting we will try you on a run
to build trust
we do a thousand kis
in all matters when you work for us you must do exactly what you say you will do
beat in this business with me if you say you will do a thing you must do exactly that thing
you will prosper beyond your dreams and you can live in miami in millionaire style
beat if you are arrested there will be lawyers made available to you in the united states
you will use them
anything you need you will be provided by me
it cost you nothing
you will contact and work through jose yero on logistics and communications
to do with money you will work through my wife isabella
crockett notices that montoya lightly holds her hand
and he sees the slight smile on isabellas face as she watches he and tubbs
montoya contd more than i in finance and business she is very dangerous
i look forward to our doing work together
whether we do or not it is unlikely we will meet again
so i extend my best wishes to your families
to tubbs particularly to your beautiful wife
beat thank you for making this long trip to see me
dismissed they exit
subterranean alarms are going off
tubbs finds himself in this small city occupied by narcotraffickers and their security in the middle of nowhere
urgency agitates tubbs
he controls it
in the town square now too
but isabella stayed inside montoyas suburban
now she lowers her window
montoyas suburbans pull out
the security cordon deforms
it all disappears around them
it leaves only the mercedes a driver and crockett and tubbs
looks after the caravan
in the side view mirror on the passenger side
she is looking at him
holds that look
his attention is on the woman in the mirror
until its broken by tubbs attention to his cell phone
signal strength returns
tubbs punches in numbers
low who did we just meet
a phone rings
its picked up by gina
tubbs is relieved
calling to say hi
whats up with you
to tubbs thats good news
see you soon
and thanks for the flowers
the bouquet here
five hundred dollars worth of roses
there a note
you mean with the flowers
whats it say
salutations from the south
a deep chill
gina contd i
i thought it was from you
and now she gets it
gina is in the kitchen
alone in their secret safe house location
she and tubbs have nothing to say
he looks to crockett
the message from montoya londono is clear i know you
i can reach out and locate you our yours
you are not safe
were on our way
forced casual so why dont you
meet the plane
we sense this is code
it means get the fuck out of there right now
beat well grab a bite
gina ends the call drops to the floor to the wall kills the lights holds her sig
mm at her side as she moves deeper into the interior
close on their two faces
hes holding her hand under the table
the noise of the surrounding crowd is a roar
thats the idea
they want their words buried under noise
discreetly at the door watching the street
trudy switek and zito are at adjacent tables
the lease the phones the cars
layers of false ident
would take the fbi weeks
how long did it take them
re the note this means we can reach out and touch somebody
like bad teleflora
cuts in even if they could run the identities you built to epic all theyll find is more cover
trust what you built
its quality girl
leans in holds his hand tighter you are trying to reassure me because you know when people get anxious they make mistakes
youre worried about me
do not be
into his eyes i am careful
i am cool
i got trudy backup whatever
you worry about you
because you are the ones who are in denied territory not me
if your focus is on me youll miss something coming at you
thats how people slip up
and id die if anything happened
you worry about you
you and sonny
are in the dangerous place
gina leans back in her chair
their eyes still connect across the distance between them
their hands still touch
gina contd loud fuck em
they sent us some flowers
thanks for the flowers
gina calabrese shrugs
tubbs laughs and we are
half light washes the walls from passing headlights
tubbs are gina are naked
its the lovemaking of a man and a woman when they hold precious the moments they have because they know that in these moments they are safe
and that the present is fleeting
and they know their time together is about luck
because life is short
departure is imminent
nothing lives forever
its in their faces and their eyes
a lantern lights his face
the night is soft
crocketts with a couple of campesinos playing poker and drinking beer
whoevers shack this is is a tupac shakur freak
his image is on all the walls
a diesel truck starts and pulls away outside
checking the cargo tie downs inside an a adam aircraft
his shirts off
the cargo is ten black plastic wrapped and taped bundles
like any good pilot tubbs trusts nobody but himself to tie down the load
the rear seats are removed
theres a plastic bladder holding a reserve of gallons of avgas
the girls shriek
crockett pushes the money towards the campesinos
one will only accept the money if crockett accepts his randall hunting knife
tubbs is in the doorway
crockett kisses the girls gracious about the gift
tubbs looks out into the night
to the limit
you worried about the tree line us customs awacs or something else on your mind
gina in the miami pad
no answer you gonna give me phony denials
beat you gonna give me phony reassurances
so lets go
they head toward the strange looking plane
its a single fuselage with two propellers
one at the nose one at the tail
off the wings are two booms that connect to a rear wing
its a burt rutan aircraft design
there is neither metal nor exposed exhausts for radar or if to spot
it does knots at feet
itll fly forever kilos of flake worth million and the total air weight is less than two bentleys
its the smugglers dream airplane
heads for the tree line
it will not make it
at the last moment tubbs pulls back the stick and the plane lofts over the trees clipping the tops
throws a look sideways at tubbs
airborne over the caribbean heading north
into radio transglobal airlines flight zero zero zero
is in the air
tubbs points up and to the right
crockett wakes looks
an aero commander turbo twin is paralleling the a s course
now it slides over them
almost into a collision
it sits right over the a separated by only feet
handling a myriad of flights reacts
on his radar he sees next to the image of the aero commander a ghost image
eleven ten sierra do you have a visual on another aircraft
switek is flying and looks down at the a below
negative opa locka
keys his radio
opa locka air traffic control to jit seven six nellie charlie
hello opa locka
ive got an aero commander coming in on a two seventy nine heading but i had a double image
like theres another plane there now im only picking up on one
what do you read
let me see
his flir forward looking infrared picks up switek and zitos air commander
he flips through all the different modalities of detection including thermography for anything else suspicious in the airspace
into mic too many mai tais at lunch
youre seeing double
we get the joke
the a with its stealthiness under the aero commander together like a single footprint
piggybacked enter us airspace and cross the coastline into florida
from underneath the aero commander sweeps to the right on approach as tubbs radically dives for the trees hugging the contour at knots at feet
having snuck this plane and its load into the united states of america
alone in the acid yellow glare of the sodium vapor lights
we dont know why were here
and we reveal staked out are crockett jean louis and tubbs
neptune gonna show
we dont know who hes talking about
oh hell show
this is his kind of deal
crime on crime
whos gonna call the cops
skeptical usually his thing is street dealers
torture their families until they cough up the stash
cruises through the parking lot past the u haul it to the other side and disappears
tubbs contd thats slick neptunes escalades worth more than the real estate
but no ones supposed to notice his drive by
heres another incognito genius
cruises the other end of the parking lot
the escalade returns
both converge around the u haul it truck
out of the escalade steps neptune narrow shouldered and bald
from the malibu and back of the escalade four more haitian zo pounders with handguns shotguns and shades
pops the lock on the u haul it with a crowbar
he rolls up the door expecting millions worth of cocaine
instead he comes face to face with the barrel of a gauge
april fool motherfucker
trudy whips the butt end of the shotgun around caving in neptunes cheekbone and nose
goes down for the count
switek under the truck rolls out
crockett tubbs with shotguns jean louis and zito with car s emerge from the perimeter with bright lights on shouting for the haitians to freeze
to one et vous mo fo
zo pounder brings up his weapon
crockett blows the guys legs out from under him
zito disarms him
the other two are disarmed
is rolled over by crockett
he plastic ties his wrists and feet
others are manhandled
in french get the fuck in the truck
zo pounders plastic tied are thrown into the truck with the thousand kilos of cocaine
but not neptune
the gate is rolled down and padlocked
staring at his satellite cell
he looks out the window at the passing river
soft voices from another room
probably tubbs and gina
its five in the morning
client got delivery
but there were
extras in the back of the truck
extras tried to relieve us of your weight
beat and by the by you know of a player in overtown who goes by the name of things aquatic
we dont do business with him
he tried to
ill be there
cruises storefront churches chacouteries baptist missions haitian restaurants and palm trees
men in dark trousers and white shirts lean in doorways
the suv preceding yero stops three houses before us
the excursion with yero stops two houses beyond
security very casually deploys
now yero approaches
seen through the curtains of the window were looking through
reveal tubbs watching
and he crosses to the door and opens it as yero cautiously enters
and his face registers surprise
carefully stacked in the living room are the plastic wrapped hog tied and bleeding all over his clothes in the corner is neptune
his mouth is taped
hes shaking his head
disclaiming disowning and disavowing
this the load you lost a while back
he try to take tonights load
and what do i do with him
shrugs whatever you want
like we said were not into violence
yero looks around the corner and sees switek and zito in the dining room casually at ease with galil assault rifles
meaning dont even think about it
the empty mansion is on its own peninsula
through the windows we see a yacht and crocketts stryker its canopy open but without its racing supergraphics
the mansion interior
all beaumaniers limestone
is devoid of all furnishing
they sit on white plastic garden chairs from sears
suspicious i walk into neptunes house
but i also see you
and our drugs that got ripped from maguda
you dont like us finding your load
we can go and lose it all over again
how bout this
howd neptune know where to hit us
whose op secs got a leak
whatd neptune tell you
interrogations not in our skill set
beat so cmon what suspicions have you master minded off these associations
whispers in spanish to isabella heres what this is
ask how much they want to turn back to us our load
yeros certain about their motive
we want it back
whats the recovery
how much are you looking for
to crockett how much we looking for
as in free gratis
and as an investment in the future
takes off her glasses and looks at crockett future of
she holds crocketts look
as she did before
its yours cause whats yours is yours
and whats ours is ours
to yero like the second ten percent which is now due yero my ace
yero kicks across the floor a cardboard box full of money
tubbs glances inside
doesnt count it
tubbs contd whats up next
or is this a one time deal
to yero give them the shipment on the seventeenth
yero doesnt like it
she gestures do it
jose will fill you in
and she starts to leave
and sensing crocketts gotten up and follows her
meanwhile to yero lay it out
and crockett close behind isabella now
low there is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death defying risks we took to recover your product
low and what is that
this is the wife of narcotrafficker archangel de jesus montoya londono
let me buy you a drink
crockett may get killed right now
theyre near the open doors to the patio
low what do you like to drink
low im a fiend for mojitas
isabella looks over at crocketts boat
back to crockett
low how fast does that go
it goes very fast
isabella and crockett head outside towards the dock tubbs overtakes
can i talk to you for a second partner
they step aside
tubbs contd low re isabella whas up
low i know what im doing
and he leaves to help isabella board
switek unties and pushes off the boat
looking out the window at them is jose yero as perplexed as tubbs who covers
secure satellite comms
encrypted e mail the longs and lats for the transshipment point
its all cool
but i need a vector not a location
cause ships move
thats why they call them ships
its trying to be an apartment building
at sea that attracts attention
pulling away from the docks at knots repressing the thunder of the horsepower engines
crockett leaves the canopy slid back
theyre open to the air
he gives isabella headsets so they can talk over the roar
the wind starts to move her hair
shes not sure how to put on the headset
crockett lets the boat rock over the swells while he arranges her headset around her ears
his fingers brush her hair touch her skin
it was not intentional
but the look in crocketts eyes is as if a small voltage passed through him
he plugs her headset into the dash regains the wheel shoves the throttles forward and
cuts and then leaps over swells
in seven seconds theyre doing over knots
and crockett holds it there as
the wind whips her hair behind her now
the two are small against the smooth long hull
crockett hands her wraparound shades for her eyes
she doesnt want them
through headset so wheres the best place for mojitas
bodeguita del medio
its the only place for mojitas
off a little alley with cobblestones
hemingway went there
cubans dont like us or my business
are you afraid
smiles crockett shakes his head no good
and you dont need a visa
cause youre with me
rockets from one swell to the next getting airborne
wind and salt electrify isabella
she turns to crockett and smiles putting on the glasses now
crockett gestures to her knees
she should keep them bent
crockett pushes it to knots
in strong light ripped by wind
behind them are ocean and sky and twenty foot plumes which jet from the props and make a wake that vectors in diagonals to what each is leaving behind them
where theyve been
and converge to push them to the new places where theyre headed
behind the skies are leaden
theyre racing a storm
sunlight shafts through a gap in thunderclouds turning the clouds yellow
now they turn peach against the darkening open water and the grey sky behind
the boat vibrates the engines scream and
waves her over to join him behind the wheel
he holds out his left hand to steady her
he brings her to him
both lean against his high upholstered chair
he holds her to his side
indicates the wheel
everything comes to you through the wheel
stays on the throttle throttling back when the props are out of the water so you dont redline the engine and forward when reentering
the swells are now four feet
they launch off each get airborne cut into the next
crockett contd how do we get into cuba
my cousin is the harbor master
you must not bring in drugs
you cannot be armed
if youre carrying it has to go
or stow it inside
no one will go near your boat
you do business in cuba with your husband
i never do business in cuba
beat and nobody goes to cuba but me
smiles and he is not my husband
and he doesnt push it
were you born in havana
my mother was being a surgeon there
mozambique and mali too
over the wind those days in those days
she was part of cubas gift to the third world
she came from a bourgeois family with a house in verdado
we still have the house
we will go there
wheres she now
crockett looks at her
her perspective is that of the s and s the politics of national liberation the perspective of marcuse and franz fanon
went back to the fighting
isabella looks at the look on crocketts face
isabella contd go ahead and ask
hows he not your husband
i am no ones wife
i live in my own house
i do not live in a mans house
he has a wife
we are together
i am free
because of banking and finance and travel
looks at him shouts over wind and i can do anything i want
she has that combination of intellect beauty and youth
everything is possible
life will never end
she can ride this crest eternally
and crockett knows that her confidence makes her oblivious to peril makes right now too real because she believes she will live forever
cant help it
he looks right at her
she lifts her face to the spray
some clouds part and light strikes her
and crockett wants to possess her to protect her
he wants no one else to have her
he wants no harm to come to her
and this is an impulse that takes him over to the core of who he is
and as we move in closer crockett has to turn away
crockett looks back at her
their eyes connect
his left arm around her shoulder his right on the wheel
she rocks back against his body
they rip across the seas
piece afro cuban band
in the press of dancers at a small table crockett and isabella
shouts over noise mojitas
shouting back later
do you dance
they move into the crowd under two story high windows overlooking meyer lanskys hotel riviera freeze dried las vegas
whatever we knew about sonny crockett we did not know he could dance
their feet their knees and thighs perfectly matched they samba like lightning
he swings her around and turns her to a close embrace as their hips and legs parallel each others as he turns her under his arm stops her pulls her
backwards into his body her hips into his the fast beat the footwork and he spins her back facing him pressing her closer as it gets faster and
fall onto a bed shedding the last of their clothes making love in a house somewhere
beyond them is an open window to the ocean
the sky turns red and grey but the water stays molten
their eyes are open
because theyre locked together the whole time and their faces are steady and urgently surprised because this is not language not a symbol not a representation of a thing
jesus montoya is not here
miami is not here
this is discovery
this is fact
they have discovered each other and have never felt like this about anyone before in their lives
his eyes open
he wakes up
light and situation flood in
he does not know where he is
he pulls on his pants
barefoot he walks to the window
the interior is high ceilinged with immaculately polished floors
and crockett looks around a stranger in a stranger place
the paint on the outside of this house is peeling and patinaed with stain
the yard is overgrown
the stucco fence around the streamline deco facade is crumbling from weather and time
from the balcony of the futuristic villa in verdado
a futurism from peeling aqua aging science fiction
wherever we are in the world this place is out of the stream outside history
and isabella this woman from a different world enters brings him an oversized cup of coffee
in his trousers crockett drapes an arm across her shoulders and they stand in the air
hears voices from the interior
she looks after the place
beat this was my mothers familys home
in the funky yellow restaurant drinking mojitas
theyve had lunch served to them at the bar
frosted glasses have sugar on the bottom and are loaded with crushed cuban herbs
the bartender has been there for years
crockett and isabella look like regulars
theyve served chicken and plantains
like any restaurant the people eating at the bar are the regulars
they sit where hemingway sat in the slow part of the afternoon
tell me everything
beat macon georgia is where i was born
wound up in a juvenile facility
then the military
because i was dumb and angry
then i read
then i got smart
then i discovered what i know now
its all business
crockett contd to bartender my friend two more
beat what was your mothers name
a rubio like you
pause i see her in a dress
an old photograph from lucinda somebodys wedding
everybody is with couples
husbands and wives
they all pose
my mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting
she points she looks right into the camera
she is the most beautiful woman in the room
in a party dress
and she looked like she knew she would die alone
remembers she spoke many languages
we were in luanda when she died
i went to her friends in mali
they sent me to the ecole polytechnique in geneva to study mathematics where i met montoya in the discos
he had banking there
i was seventeen and very much into the clubs
and he sent me to university for an mba in finance
pause your mother
died in childbirth having me
and all that we owe them
isabella looks at crockett and smiles and puts on her sunglasses
you know how improbable this is
applies to an event that may be real
doesnt apply here
cause we have no future
are of today and not tomorrow
laughs thats right
and therafore there is no consequence
crocketts hand is around her waist and slips down her hip as he pulls her closer and takes off her glasses and she puts down her drink and kisses him
at the bar and crocketts eyes dwell on her and she looks back at him and now knowing what hes thinking
the water is like sheet metal as clouds allow only a sliver of light to illuminate the sea while rain greys out most of it
minute crimson is a freighter heading to the stone harbor
fabric billows in the wind
pull back into the room to crockett and isabella
one light skinned the other brown intertwine in the opiated moments after sensuality
the afternoon half light drapes parts of their bodies making a relief against which their eyes hold each others
its as if hes struggling to record the event of her in memory so shell sustain there because he compels himself to a different place now
then the shower curtain parts
it startles him
she touches his back
he turns to her with a smile
soft lets talk deliveries
isabella is not let down by the switch to commerce
she merely goes there too
after all this is their subject
crockett contd and a different kind of deal
like three thousand a ki
and i can supply the transportation into south florida and the gulf more reliable and on time than fedex
but three per ki was ok for openers
and why should continuing excellence cost more
thats the point
is it december
what do you mean
did christmas come early this year
better than that
beat we become partners
only in this territory and only on loads we run
and you dont pay us three thousand a ki
you pay us zero
why we get is thirty percent of the load
product or cash
and why youre thinking would i be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that
is he chipping
crazy for my love
too many mojitas
and the answer is of course but also no
it is because sonny can deliver what no one else can
good samba dancing
cause you dont lose loads
cause we guarantee every load
beat anywhere for any reason it comes up short we make good
your operations will from now on run risk free
and youre our thirty percent partner
her knowing smile speaks of experience beyond her years
isabella contd deadly seriously what if i tell you that your ideas are too big for your skin
beat that merely to propose this is a dangerous thing
then i would say to you this has been fun
theres a long pause
this is business
this is what is
the range should be between fifteen and seventeen point five percent of the p
to even consider it
i need thirty
calculate in also the cash you dont have to front
available cash is not an issue for us
twenty eight point five
what if i pushed to twenty one
i would say youre
hesitates holds up four fingers four percentage points away from a deal
maybe im only one
and she slides into his arms
well do it at twenty two
she kisses him under the shower water
and its tough to know who is pushing it further out onto the edge
crockett contd and now what
and now i make you breakfast again
her breathing is heavier as she buries her head in his neck
crockett is alone
black skies mottled with grey
rain and wind rip across his face
he left isabella in havana
crockett picks it up
where the hell are you man
into phone on my way back
he pushes it
it launches from one swell airborne and knifes into the next
crocketts thoughts and expression are about isabella
they are criminal conspirators a woman cheating on her narcotrafficker husband an outlaw smuggler whos really an undercover cop
rockets in and then throttles back
sitting on the u shaped jetty as we hear crockett kill the engines tying it off
gina stands halfway up the small lawn to the early s ranch house under tropical palms
tubbs mood is dark
as crockett approaches he looks blankly at tubbs offering no explanation
mutters the meet with castillo and the fed got set up
its in minutes
tubbs goes inside
as he passes gina
whats up sonny
crockett looks at her
he has no answer
while tubbs is strapping up
whered you go
hit a couple of jazz clubs
fell back to her place
its in the suburbs outside havana
beat dont we have a meet
where youre makin a move on the wife of archangel de jesus montoya
youre not makin a move on her
were makin moves on each other
oh that makes it okay then
weve entered a secret meeting mid argument
who said go exploring
we want this staying on track
to fujima whos the we
theres you and theres us
and all we got from you was bad intel
low level producer
what are you talking about
we went to meet the village priest
it turns into alice in the fucking vatican and heres the pope
of the north valle colombia dope trade
his operations are kingpin size and first class
his security is ex eastern bloc ex sas and israelis
their comms are satellite uplink with mainframe encryption significant sig int and in their zones of activity they have signal jamming capability
fujima is surprised
cia level stuff
and what does that level of spending on first class private sector infrastructure signify to you
mega tonnage and mega cash flow
haiti and puerto rico
money through dubai and geneva maybe
their loads are poly drug
e from holland methamphetamine precursors from jordan afghan h
mid ocean transshipments
his real business is hes a network
and we can illuminate part of it from the inside out
so we want to change up the mission statement
no identify and indict the white supremacist group of importers
end of story
everything else im hearing is speculation masquerading as intel
crockett flips him a set of keys
fujima contd whats this
keys to the boat
go do this motherfucker yourself
fujima looks at castillo
who is this insubordinate prick
who are you talking to
hes talking to you bro
beat what he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization
re fujima hey fuck him
chill out sonny
were the ones doing the death defying shit
and he wants us to give that up
a chump change bust so he can get his picture in the miami herald to impress the slug farm in dc
to castillo control your men
im my own man
and anytime you want to see how much man i am
everybody shuts up
castillo contd to tubbs where are you on this
we know tubbs has doubts about crocketts motives and methods nevertheless
then thats it
to fujima change the mission statement
crockett stays in
he keeps working up the ladder
the local importers get a pass for the time being
i dont know
yes you do
i got to talk to my ado
no you dont jim
beat cause if i close this down you got nothing to make a phone call about
and my guys dont have a week for a feeb bureaucratic process
every hour longer theyre in there they risk exposure
so right here right now theyre back in or i pull them out and close you down
whats it going to be
fujima nods acquiescence
when hes out of earshot
to crockett you fuckin better be right
step across to a second ship among the dozens tied up along the river
its crimson paint is peeling and its been stripped of everything salvageable
low what is going on
there is undercover
and there is which way is up
you think i am in so deep i forgot
i am asking
you to me
do you believe
i have forgotten i am a cop
i would never doubt you
this is the answer crockett needed to hear
tubbs contd and do you doubt i will slot anyone complicit in the death of maria alonzo and those children
whoever they are
no i do not
and we know that might mean isabella
we are on a peninsula with palm trees
a bluff dotted with a small forest of satellite dishes
a ribbon of white sand and beyond that is silver light off the water
it is rural and futuristic at the same time
and day futures with shorted canadian and us dollars
in pajama top and boxer shorts smoking a cigar
in a sweatsuit is isabella delivering a financial report
its from memory
nothing is written down in the tradition of the elite section of swiss private banking in which clerks commit portfolios to memory
there are no documents
and were looking at nigerian crude
precursor shipments from ras tanura and juaymah
transshipped to a malaysian container ship
not french registry
theyve been targeted
and pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now
jose doesnt like the deal in south florida
montoyas referring to crockett
alarm bells go off
cuts in burnett
shrugs they want of the value on loads they run into south florida
its the juarez cartel model
they guarantee the loads
the upside is our risk goes to zero
that frees up capital
but what does your intuition tell you
is he suspicious
does he suspect isabella and crockett are lovers
my intuition made him breakfast the other morning in havana
her lieson with crockett is the last thing we expected to hear from isabella
theyll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a deliverys handled
theyd walk away rather than compromise operational security
isabella contd but they have to be watched closely
a good deal like this with us for burnett will be good only temporarily
hell get restless because he believes nothing is forever
life is dust make it while you can
montoya appreciates her thoughtfulness
isabella contd so i predict a few good runs
then therell be a renegotiation
thats my girl
montoya uses isabella and her sexual allure to gather insight into the people he does business with
thats part of their deal
montoya contd on the next load jose wants to front them silver
but they them in lead
beat he thinks they are wrong
what do you think
revealing nothing i think jose suspects anybody he doesnt intimidate
and people who are good at what they do
they have egos too
careful what would you do
equally careful i like the diminished risk
it frees up capital reserves
i like working with self interested businessmen who are competent
you can predict their behavior
montoya looks at her very carefully
she stares right back at him
isabella contd on the other hand
if what you wish mi corazon is la plumba
then lets do that
accept their deal
after the load is received
we will close their eyes forever
she looks at montoya squarely
it hangs in the air
in his strange process of decision making montoya reaches a conclusion
lets try a few runs with these partners i think
i will tell jose
if isabella is pleased she doesnt show it
montoya continues to stare at her unwavering expression frozen in stone
he smiles then and starts to take off her clothes
he reaches for her hand and brings her to him
she kisses him and he puts aside his cigar pulls her face into his neck and she runs her hands down him
the door opens
she searches looking for someone as she descends the ramp
emerges from behind an suv
he came to meet her plane
expression changes but she masks it
businesslike she walks across the tarmac
there are two suburbans
one for her one full of security
crockett and her meet
no show of affection
her secretary carrying her briefcase accompanies her towards the second suburban
crockett and isabella climb in
the rear is customized cream leather luxurious with three telephones and a divider
as isabella climbs in followed by crockett she takes the briefcase from the secretary and indicates he ride in the front vehicle
windows go up
air conditioning comes on
she raises the divider blocking the driver and locks the doors
they are sealed in the back
and she assaults crockett with a passion thats desperate
as if making love to him puts her world back in balance
their clothes come off crockett pauses
he touches the side of her face
dont stop bad man
as they continue we
at the bar
cochi loco yero and his permanent bodyguard el tiburon pass smile
tubbs introduces yero to gina as his wife
yero shakes ginas hand
he indicates to the bartender that tubbs and gina are to pay for nothing
and he moves towards an office
cobalt blue light illuminates his face and his fierce yellow eyes are not filled with hospitality
deplaning his g crosses to his armored suburban
climbs into the back
its also a traveling communications center satellite uplink encryption the works
to an assistant do you have him
montoya takes the heavy handset
montoya contd jose about the americans
in spanish they are wrong
i do not trust them
in spanish why
in spanish too good at what they do i dont know
something i dont like
they are wrong
in spanish isabella likes them
we made their deal
montoya hangs up
jose yero looks at the phone
they join tubbs and gina
sees crocketts carriage with this woman
intuitively she exchanges a look with tubbs
crockett makes introductions
then they move away to dance to a fast samba in perfect synchronicity
and theyre also seen by
he watches them too
his yellow eyes are lit by strobes
his eyes locked onto isabella
dancing with crockett their bodies close
and in the way he looks at them hurt like a betrayed lover which he isnt and never could have been
we know now the core of his antagonism
its a year old well maintained carribean freighter with a steel table and u shaped bench
in the dark interior narrow spots reveal the group hovering over a ruggedized workpad with navigational software
transshipment point is here at hours on the rd
no predetermined places and times to meet
give me their heading and radio codes and i will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal
you give yours to me
we position all the assets hauling our loads
now how we do it blood
it risks signal interception and other bad things like people who dont need to know where were at knowing
tubbs hands jose yeros assistant el tiburon a pager
at ten to three on the th i will satellite page him with a website and encryption code
he will have ten minutes to log on and receive his new heading
ten minutes and thirty seconds website disappears and he can drive his fucking boat up to iceland
jose yero doesnt like it
to el tiburon give them their codes and heading
everything yero tells them feels to him like exposure
fifty gallon drums
a hundred kilos in each
you transship that to the malaysian boat
at twenty two thousand a ki
you work that out with la senora
beat you will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the malaysian ship
for collection in north miami
you warehouse it
release it when we say
beat im sure you have friends with fast boats
if you see a few new faces dont get jumpy
and jose my ace lots of transshipment
lots of action
skies are crowded
and the jit has assets on land air and sea
beat so any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare
jose yeros on the spot
check your e mail
yero gets up and leaves the confined dining room
he exits onto the walkway outside the bridge
his path takes him past
with switek and zito
trudys in a tank top
jose looks at trudy appreciatively
returns the look with a stare that says dont fuck with me
jose raises his eyebrow and after noting the two handguns holstered in the waistband of her hiphuggers
cochi locos security leads and tails behind as
to el tiburon you know what escobar used to do
goes on in the s air routes came into favor
it required many pilots
the best were american
former crop dusters
they didnt fly by the book
tell one put that down on this fifteen hundred foot runway
somehow hed do it
but pablo had a rule
after they flew six loads
this good pilot who facilitates so much good business
he would come back to medellin or barranquilla to pick up the next load
beat and no one would ever see him again
imitates pablo you a good pilot
make a lot of money for pablo
thank you very much
and then pablo would kill his ass
after six loads
pause and who was pablo escobar
a provincial who got busted out by the white collars from cali
when the gringos got him he was nobody
were three times better than pablo escobar
beat the means we kill these sonsabitches three times sooner
beat and do you know why pablo escobar did that
he didnt like pilots
enter from the cargo shed onto a roadway just as
passes by driven by switek
theyre en route to pick up tubbs
and put eyes on her
put eyes on her twenty four hours a day
isabella hands out banana leaves wrapped and tied around cooked rice and barbecued pork
gina and tubbs walk away down the beach towards phosphorescent waves
i forgot the napkins
and the chopsticks and fortune cookies
whats the best fortune you ever got
theyre all the same
financial security is around the corner
your friends love you
in kowloon once i got one that said live now because life is dust
crockett and isabella wander down the beach hard from the ebb tide
do you have assets somewhere else
to fall back on
you know a fail safe
do i need it
shrugs everybody needs it
laughs cause whatever can go wrong will
the perseids make the night sky over the water look like the fourth of july
something like that
the odds catch up with you
the odds are like gravity
you cant negotiate with them
at some point you should cash out take your money and run
as far away and as fast as you can
maybe later maybe sooner
what is sonny crockett trying to say to her
would you find me
where would i go
the comoros islands
somewhere in the indian ocean
theres twelve hundred islands there
smiles is this the protective male talk
deadly serious this is the talk of a man
if he were your husband
he would never put you at risk
he would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you
and if i were in the comoros in the indian ocean where would you be
a few more moments still in this business
then id find you
because if you couldnt i would be very lonely
i would have left the only world i know and have known since i was seventeen
smiles touches crockett but none of this will happen
so it doesnt matter
because we are on the guajira peninsula
and all you see around you
is archangel de jesus montoya londono
he is my man
and you are a smuggler moving a load
her eyes say that she listened to his warnings and will disregard them
life is dust
meaning is in the moment and thats right now
the intensity is because its impossible
because its impossible theyve been free to imagine
and thats made the heat of it stronger
in the morning
ill be on board by noon
crockett didnt expect that
isabella contd what did you think
this deal with you is my deal
i am responsible
she vouched for him
she has to stand behind it
he puts his arm around her waist
the freighter is anchored a half mile offshore
magenta breaks the horizon
trudy looks at crockett looks away
too many moving parts
zito joins them
but its your call boss
tubbs joins them
whats your take
whats the point
its going down
call the us coast guard come and arrest our ass
beat and switek resumes romancing miss ukraine
crockett looks at trudy
theres a connection between crockett and trudy
crockett has a special regard for her judgment
if we were for real and knew our shit wed fade this one
then you should
no if youre down were down for the play
she approaches along the sidewalk down the walkway under the banana trees and birds of paradise
motion sensors trigger exterior lights
gina cocks her ear waiting to hear
then offscreen tommy the dog barks
reassured her left hand on her
she reaches for her keys opens the door
a finger pushed the stop button
the dog stops barking
a leather sap arcs through the air and descends onto her left shoulder paralyzing her arm
other arms grab her push her head down
the same sap backhands with massive force across the back of her neck
slowly comes to consciousness
she looks around disoriented
her eyes roll back in her head and she slips into dreamland for a moment
she rouses and opens her eyes again blinks disoriented
stares at her from the back corner of the double wide trailer
with her is an overweight autistic boy of about
he plays in the corner and watches a small tv with a coat hanger for an antenna
the old woman pays gina no attention on her face is zero affect
there are other sounds in the room
and we see she is tied to a chair that is bolted to the floor
her clothes are disheveled and ripped
she tries to focus
then somebodys thick arms are fitting something around her neck
a blindfold goes over her eyes
around her neck is a c necklace like the one we saw on stevens wife in the beginning of the film
the arms and back belong to the deep chested aryan brother we saw from the stevens house and colemans double wide
move in on gina
he reaches below the frame and does something
gina writhes away from him in the chair
he backs away from her to camera
and holds something in his hand
he takes a digital picture
a tall wall of planting hides the house from the road
neighbors are double wide trailers
the house has some sophisticated radio antennas as well as a twelve foot satellite dish
on the driveway are two escalades and a bentley
out the back off the dock is a two million dollar sports fishing boat
someones entering numbers on a cell phone
the guy working the cell phone is the buzz cut aryan brother we saw in the stevens kitchen in the opening
colemans shirt open in the barcalounger watching espn
his watch is loaded with ice and a four carat diamond in his ear
he is all white bling
colemans tattooed up
not with cool celtic symbols
his tats are neo nazi white supremacist hard core prison stuff
in the hands of the deep chested aryan brother
three girls in cutoffs and halters are making sandwiches and laughing in the b
then el tiburon
coleman takes the satellite phone attached to a laptop
he enters a number
a frequency response graphic displays in the computer
his conversation with el tiburon is encrypted so the voices are distorted
in spanish meth precursors and the dutch party favors are en route
perfect spanish all i want to know is the where and the when
spare me mini moves progress reports and bullshit
in spanish okay
you got the item
i got the item
in spanish and our friend dont like the rest of the people bringin the merch to you
in spanish how many

coleman hangs up
in calm seas theyre tied up to a malaysian small container ship
on it yemenese with ak s maintain a watchful eye
from crocketts pov as
with an assortment of car s galils and two rpgs mount a similar guard
swung by the honduran freighters crane cross of open water onto freighters deck to join others already there
its the last of the transfer
loud hailer me a salama
ila l liqa
watches crew stow the cargo
then his satellite phone blinks red light
crockett boots up the computer to encryption
picks up the phone
phone filter hey captain kirk
i think maybe i have second thoughts
into phone you got something to say jose lets hear it
i confess i have succumbed to my weaknesses
an inability to see anothers point of view
beat ive discussed it with professionals
even with one of your friends
shes here now
crockett puts him on speaker
jose yero contd beat so i want you to deliver my product how i want my product delivered
isabella walks in
crockett gestures for her to be quiet
but dont worry
she is safe
to insure that i am keeping her close to me
its always good to keep people your friends care about close to you
tubbs reaches for the phone
trudy intercepts him
crockett turns it away and goes off the speaker
jose yero contd so i will tell you when youre minutes out where to drop the load into the hands of my people
you have minutes to enter government channel
head up the river
we will watch you
then i will call you
beat and you can reach out for la senora in barranquilla or wherever cause i dont give a shit
jose yero does not know isabellas on board
proof of life
how do i know mrs
cause she will tell you
he hangs up
turns on isabella you set this up
sarcastic of course
that is why i placed myself here with you knowing yero would pull this crap
yero doesnt know shes here
crockett looks at isabella whos distracted in calculating whats really happening
entering cigarette and the two starkeys are coming in
they grabbed gina
isabella punches numbers into a satellite phone
its all bullshit
jesus is out of communication in fals de iguazu
jose knows that
whatever hes going to do he has to do it fast because hes acting on his own
and he will need a story
they will kill you
and then they will kill your wife too
yero by himself
maybe with the crazy whites
zito enters makes the situation
were half loaded
like alonzos wife
cochi locos got her
dump the rest
lets get the boats up that river
crockett picks up the phone and dials
his eyes contact with tubbs has tubbs take isabella out of the captains bridge
she pulls her arm away
as they head down from the bridge
lines run from the freighter to two go fast boats
the fuel bladders with crampons slide down the rope into the smaller cigarette boats
dope on a rope
loaded takes off into the night no lights
a second one pulls away as the third boats being loaded switek and zito climb into a cigarette
on the satellite phone
jose yero changed up the drop plan on us
hes grabbed gina
wheres the new drop point
theyll have surveillance on us
well know only at the last moment
what do you think
its a rip and a hit
to someone else get me air support
to crockett well be airborne and assault the ambush
theyll kill gina
they may have already so we protect the living
proof shes alive
supposedly its coming
rip from one swell to another airborne in between their load
trudys on the comms
switek drives with night vision gear
tubbs is on the throttles
isabellas between them
then tubbs is sent a page
reads the number
picks up the satellite phone
crockett takes control of the throttles too
into phone hello
and tubbs hears
and weather on the southeast throughout today and looking into the weekend is broken clouds humidity small chance of rain
and coming up in four minutes at is lou dobbs with fridays market previews
todays friday the three hundredth and fourteenth day of the year
theyre proving its right now
and that shes alive right now
nice friends you got
trailer trash with a bad smell
the phone is ripped away from her
he puts it together
he gets it shes allergic to diethylene
she in a meth lab
crockett takes the phone dials castillo
just came in
shes still alive
safe house is empty
beat air supports set to jump when we know your drop point
takes phone shes sending a message
anything with interesting antenna arrays
theres three between miami international and the glades
im gonna try for her but this is triage
protect the maximum number of lives
you need to know that
crockett knows the sophies choice castillo may have to make
and it may cost gina
crockett glances at tubbs
crockett pushes the throttles forward
jam over the swells into government channel not slowing this time even though the limit is knots
barely missing sport fishing boats slower recreational craft
over his flir monitor scanning trailer parks
then he notes a double wide with two satellite dishes
to tubbs three possibles
on with castillo
swats on the next two
trudy and i are goin for gina
slams the scarab sideways spewing a huge wake driving it through a circle to slough off speed as he pulls into a dock
crocketts stryker does the same
tubbs transfers into this boat with trudy and zito
switek gets into the stryker with crockett and isabella
as they speed up government channel
if they attack you
finishes its gonna be an l shaped ambush
theyre not gonna open up until they got the party favors cause all theyd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight
they will wait till they got the goods before they do the deed
radio filter do you have her
trudy doesnt answer
shes totally focused on a clamshell video screen connected to a fiber optic
follow the fiber optic
as a swat technician feeds it into
where it meets the wall a tiny hole has been drilled and we see the mm diameter lens connected to the flexible fiber optic poke through
the cameras on the floor where it meets the wall
and trudy and we see in fish eye a long haired nazi low rider and the bulked out brother with the hefty garbage bag apron
deeper in the trailer her clothes torn blindfolded is gina with the c necklace
beyond her the woman in the house dress and her large retarded son
into radio to castillo have eyes on her
reacts to knock on the door
you order chinese
laughs no but im starving
laughs reaches for the door
holding the bag of chinese for the long haired nlr
he reaches and
rips long hair through the door down the stairs where two swat slam him into the ground
a baton slams twice across the back of his neck
handcuffed and tubbs and trudy are in the interior
bulked out aryan has a handgun in one hand detonator in the other
the old woman in house dress is screaming
her retarded son sees tubbs gina as a threat to his mother
grabs butcher knife
rushes forward during
aryan doesnt move
the farq like necklace of c around ginas neck
struggles against plastic ties to hear to see as
shouts surges past bulky aryan heading for tubbs
prepares for the autistic son not seeing behind him
rising from a bare mattress with an aluminum baseball bat coming up behind tubbs
slips the autistic son rotating his right arm around the kids right arm getting slashed on the back of his forearm but grabbing the sons wrist as the momentum propels
him past tubbs who torques the wrist back
screaming sons ruined wrist tubbs took the knife and as the aryan brother swings the bat
ducks the bat
it dents the faux wood paneling
tubbs slams the knife twice into the mans slide doubling him up leaving the ab brother to crawl bleeding with a inch butcher knife through his kidney into his right
and tubbs gun in his left hand has never moved off target of the aryan brother with the detonator in his hand the whole time until right now he snaps
a round into the wounded aryan brothers head
and that fast tubbs gun is back on target
a nihilistic smile dawns there
shoot me she dies
hey fuck it man
we can all go
cool thats not what will happen
that stops him what will happen is
as shes aiming her car and slowly taking up the slack on the trigger
what will happen is i will put a round precisely through the medula at the base of your brain at an entry point mid distance between your upper lip and
the bottom of your nose and you will be dead from the neck down
your finger wont be able to twitch
do you believe that
thats all he gets out
trudy does exactly that
aryan brother falls like a felled tree
tubbs retrieves the detonator
trudy unties gina
carefully tubbs pulls the sensitive remote detonator from his hands
puts his coat over gina
as she half leaves turns to the fallen ab
she kicks him in the head
tubbs grabs her to pull her off
on radio to castillo got gina
into loud hailer go
caliber burrows is hit about times from mpd swat firing from across the bridge on a down angle towards him
mpd helicopters suddenly light up the sky
observing from a block south on the bridge sees the police assault raises night vision binoculars
behind structures on the jetty
crockett fires with the mpd pushes send on his satellite phone
the technicians are eating in the next room
we hear the recording
in spanish isabella
the gringos are police
shes their informant
pulls out racing to get away from the firefight
but bright light freezes it
heavy rounds slam into the engine crack the block stream sprays it seizes up
suburban crashes into a car at the curb
yero bails out
half out of his seat a galil in full auto on his shoulder hovering above yero and the suburban
loud hailer freeze
youre under arrest
down on your knees
put your hands on your head
does none of that
enraged he pulls up a mm h k smg to fire up at the helicopter aiming down at cam
the assault rifle unloads in three shot bursts
the pavement the car and yero are cratered by the
yero goes down
tubbs bails grabbing his duffle bag and the rifle and turns down the street towards the firefight and crockett
holding isabella down fires past a toyota
its turned into a sieve
he tells isabella to stay behind the engine block
then he assaults the ambush
is shot in the calf spins goes down gets up limps to cover keeps firing
taking and returning fire from crockett and zito and from his left flank from the swat team on the bridge
knows every moment more hes here more mpd assets are coming in
he wants to finish it faster
bails off the freighter onto the dock
dark haired aryan brother with a full auto ak is with him
they move from cover to cover their heavy kevlar body armor absorbing rounds
and they attack crockett and zito who are outgunned
run for cover fire three shot bursts run and cover
runs from cover into the clear with her handgun firing at the crazy whites furious at the betrayal by yero
shes shouting in spanish
sees isabella moves
sees isabella swings his assault rifle onto her as
and sees coleman because hes turned hes exposed his legs and crockett slows and blows colemans legs out from under him
colemans on the ground scrambling for his rifle to kill isabella
dark haired nlr is pulling the trigger on crockett when boom
fires the m grenade launcher loaded with shot
dark haired nlr is nearly cut in half
fire at the prone coleman
continues as other nlr battle miami swat
goes to isabella pulls her into the shadows away from dockside keeping her low seemingly away from the police
ok how will they get out of here
approaches from the left
tubbs and crocketts eyes connect
sees his partner with this woman
the frozen moment
isabella doesnt understand the changed expression on tubbs face
all meaning is transmitted
and tubbs nods
and the nod means get her out of here
as tubbs speaks into his radio his right arm belted where it was slashed heading towards the diminished firefight now under mpd control as
through the weeds and scrap away from the firefight away from the freighters away from the police
beyond them we hear the gunfight diminishing
enter from the rubble filled industrial lot
cars have stopped their occupants seeking cover behind them
crockett hesitates not at all
he grabs a late s mercedes left with its door open
its owner a middle aged man at the curb starts to object
crockett raises his gun
crockett steals away in it down the street into the night its lights off
he steadies her
then crockett sees something and she does too
appears around the corner
rearview mirror flashing lights on his tail
nowhere to go
thinks this is it
swat shotguns and assault rifles approach
touch the windshield with your hands
let em see your hands are empty
approaching dont move
keep your hands where i can see them
then the swat sergeant stops
swat sergeant contd sonny
the police relax turn away
are you okay
going to miami general
check out gina
crockett nods and drives through the roadblock
he drives away into the night
does not look at isabella
he shoots up the on ramp onto i
his eyes at the moment are world weary and street wise
its all out
all is in the open
finally he looks over his right shoulder at her
stares at him
for the first time she realizes hes the police and has been undercover
and now she hits him
swerves across three lanes up on two wheels almost rolls cuts off a semi which barely recovers and spins out onto the shoulder off the shoulder down into the gravel
it comes to a stop and
tries to bring her
crockett overpowers her
takes the gun
she slams him in the face with a closed fist
he grabs her wrists spins her around pushes her at the door handcuffs her behind her back
he floors the mercedes
it spins through degrees scattering gravel and dust and pulls back onto the freeway driving out of the city away from miami out into the night
she wont look at him
she wont reply
shes frozen immobile withdrawn deep darkly into herself
isabella wonders where hes taking her what will happen to her but she wont ask
the cypress are silhouettes against a lighter mauve sky
then the mercedes enters and speeds down the empty two lane blacktop
and at the end the trees open up and theres the open ocean and beyond that the florida keys
we see a house
crockett leads isabella in
he uncuffs her
she rips away from his hand holding her arm
she walks to the other end of the large room with the picture windows overlooking the water and the jetty and a boat tied up there
sparse it was built in the s
she walks to a restroom slams the door
offscreen a faucet runs
suddenly the door opens
she comes out glaring shouting
what are you going to do with me
are you taking me to jail
you think i will turn into your informant is that it
in stencilled body armor storm in through doors and windows
it is a police action an assault
its as if no one had ever lived there
a few papers flutter in the breeze from the light wind entering through the open doorways
white papers against white marble against white walls
a profound statement of nobody is home
wherever montoya is he is not here
staring out the window at the narrow jetty
isabella sits distantly alone at the end
crockett joins her
shes withdrawn into herself
no part of it wasnt real
quietly and now
it still is
im so in this i dont know which way is up
all i know is i wont let anything bad happen to you
beat just like i said
beat and i know we cant ever see each other again
and we never will
isabella sits there for a moment
she glances at him looks away
you said time is luck
meaning who can tell
there may be a time for them somewhere else
luck ran out
beat this was too good to last
he touches her hand
and she leans all her weight against his arm
the moonlight is silver tinged with green
someone else had been in the bed with him but he is there alone now
crockett wakes up
he looks around
she was there and now shes gone
he gets out of the bed and looks out to the ocean and the jetty
the boats gone
sonny crockett looks out the window
