natural born killers early by quentin tarantino a coffee shop somewhere in new mexico
mickey knox his back turned to us is sitting at the counter finishing his meal
we hear the ping
of a pinball machine being played off mabel a waitress comes over and fills mickeys coffee cup
what kind of pies do you have
apple pecan cherry and key lime
which do you recommend
the key lime is great but its an acquired taste
i havent had a key lime pie in ten years
when ya had it did ya like it
no but that dont mean much
i was a completely different person ten years ago
lets give key lime a day in court
and a large glass of milk
mabel turns to her right
to someone o
should i make that two pieces
camera pulls back and we see for the first time mallory knox mickeys wife sitting on a counter stool next to him
her back is to the camera as well
annoyed my names not rosey
points at name tag its mabel
mabel exits frame
mallory hops from the stool walks over and grabs the jar next to the cash register then dumping out the coins on the counter she selects a quarter
hey what the hell do you think youre doin
mallory saunters past the cowboy playing pinball
as his eyes follow mallory he loses his ball
she walks to the jukebox in the back inserts the quarter selects a song punches the buttons a needle lands on a record and a good god almighty rockabilly tune
cuts through the coffee shop
mabel brings mickey his pie and milk
to mickey she ought not be doing that
thats for jerrys kids not rock n roll
camera moves around to a cu of mickey
this is the first time we see him
as he takes a bite of green pie i cant take her anywhere
mallory starts doing a slow seductive fandango around the coffee shop
shes really cooking and smoking
pinball cowboy and mabel are starting to wonder just who the hell these people are
mickey isnt paying much attention
hes too busy enjoying his pie and milk
a dirty pickup truck sporting a confederate flag decal pulls up to the coffee shop
sonny otis and earl three tough looking rednecks pile out
steam rises from beneath the pickups hood
goddamn this sumbitch is runnin hot
yall go inside
im gonna check er out
the loudness of the rockabilly song slaps sonny and otis in their faces as they walk inside the door
the sexy sight of mallory doing the ubang stomp stops them in their tracks
good god almighty
what the hell is that
thats a bitch outta hell son
otis and sonny exchange looks
take a run at er kiddo
otis heads toward mallory
sonny moves over to the counter next to mickey
otis stands in front of mallory trying to copy what shes doing
her eyes are closed at the moment so she doesnt see him
mabel sets the miller down in front of sonny
sonny takes a swig enjoying the floor show
to mickey thats some sweet piece of meat aint it
mickey turns from his pie and looks at sonny
his expression betrays nothing
her names mallory
the needle lifts off the record
the song ends
mallory opens her eyes and sees otis
dont stop now sugar
im just getting warmed up
otis gives her his best shit eating grin before turning to sonny
sonny gurgles out a laugh
hey i think shes sweet on you
otis turns to mallory as she punches him hard in the face spinning him around
sonny spews his mouthful of highlife
mallory grabs the back of otis head and smashes it down on the table cracking the linoleum
otis buckles dropping to his knees
sonny jumps off the counter stool but mickeys hand clutches hold of his shoulder
sonny spins around toward mickey loaded for bear and points his finger at him threateningly
before any threat can be made mickey whips a large buck knife out from its sheath and in a flash slices off sonnys finger
sonnys finger drops on his boot
he grabs his aching hand
blood flows from the wound
just because my womans mopping up the floor with your buddy is no reason for you to join in
mickey makes five lightning quick slashing swings
the buck knife slips back into its sheath
at first there seems to be no difference with sonny
finally blood flows from the slices made in his face and chest
the short order cook charges out of the kitchen at mickey wielding a meat cleaver and screaming
mickey whips out a
automatic from a shoulder holster inside his jacket and fires
bullets pov heading fast toward short order cooks face
short order cook puts his hands to his face and falls to the ground screaming
mickey spots earl whos standing outside the plate glass window
earls watched the whole shebang
earl mouths fuck
he turns and runs for it
mickey hurls the knife through the plate glass window which shatters
the knife plunges deep into earls back
he hits the ground dead
mickey turns to mallory
shes sitting on op of otis slamming his head repeatedly on the floor
mallory looks up at mickey
she gets off otis and moves to mickeys side
mickey trains his
on pinball cowboy whos shaking in his cowboy boots
mickey aims at mabel whos clutching the coffee pot crying
to mallory pick one
mallory does eanie meanie minie moe pointing back and forth from mabel to pinball cowboy
eanie meanie minie moe catch a nigger by the tow
if he hollers let him go
eanie meanie minie moe
my mom told me to pick the best one and you are it
she ends pointing at mabel
mickey fires the
the bullet chinks through the coffee pot mabels holding and explodes thunking her in the chest
she hits the floor dead
mickey and mallory join hands and walk over to the pinball cowboy who stands in a pool of his own urine
when you tell people what went on here tell em mickey and mallory knox did this
pinball cowboy nods yes
the two killers plant a big wet kiss on each others mouths
then holding hands mickey and mallory walk out of the cafe
mickey and mallory in a flashy cadillac coupe de ville
duane eddys rebel rouser blares on the soundtrack
is an outrageous process shot
the titles splash over this image s style

mcclusky puts the book down we see the title curtis fox the capture and death of a serial killer
author jack scagnetti
mcclusky sits on the edge of the table facing scagnetti
he lifts a file off the table then tosses it in scagnettis lap
i think youll find that good reading as well
mickey and mallorys file

scagnetti opens it
its the files reports and photographs of mickey and mallory knox
scagnettis face lights up

mcclusky lowers the book
youre a breathing icon of justice and thats why you were chosen to deliver mr

hold on scagnetti
scagnettis pov mcclusky stands next to a big iron door
he bangs on it with is fist
we stay on scagnettis pov through this scene
pete open it up
im comin through with a visitor
mcclusky opens the door and we follow him down the corridor
as soon as the door opens we can hear a female voice singing the song long time woman
mcclusky turns to scagnetti as they walk
well jack ill tell ya in all my years with the penal institution and ill tell ya thats no small number mickey and mallory knox are without a doubt the
most twisted depraved group of fucks its ever been my displeasure to lay my eyes on
i mean those two rat shits are a walkin reminder of just how fucked up our system really is
the song long time woman is getting louder as they proceed
whos the song bird
mickeys better half herself
this little lady drowned her father in a fish tank
cu of a home aquarium with fish swimming around
suddenly mallorys fathers head is shoved into the tank
while the two together burned her mother alive in her bed
medium cu of mallorys mother lying asleep in bed mouth open
what looks like a gas nozzle appears at the top of the frame pouring gasoline all over her face
she coughs and gags
camera pans up and we see mickey holding a gas can
cu of mallory with a lit match by her face
she tosses it in front of her
we hear the sounds of mallorys mother igniting
still scagnettis pov why
mccluskys still walking ahead of us
because they wouldnt give them their blessing for marriage
aint love grand
aint love grand
thats a good one
still scagnettis pov we look down from mcclusky to mallorys file in our hands
it contains her picture and lists her color of hair color of eyes height weight race etc
beneath that is a column which reads psychiatric remarks
as we read the remarks we hear a doctors voice read aloud
when pressed about the reason for the murders
patient became hostile
looking trashy wild and animalistic mallorys a sex machine dressed in a prison gown
she sits in a chair looking directly at the camera
i dont owe you an explanation
i dont owe you shit
im not here for your entertainment
if i dont tell you what you wanna hear what are you gonna do
throw me in jail
im already there you stupid pigfucker
you gonna give me some more time
ive already got life

id like to see you fuckin try
i havent met one motherfucker here whos shown me shit
still on scagnettis pov we look up from the fill and see mccluskys leaning against a cell door
we hear somebody signing long time woman inside the cell
we move to mcclusky who looking into the camera gestures toward the cell
here she is
you know her you love her you cant live without her
we pan from mcclusky to the inside of the cell where we see mallory her back to us singing and dancing
cu of mallorys face singing long time woman
singing years is a long long time
look at me i will never be free im a long time woman
somebody out here wants to meet you
mallory just keeps on truckin
singing been workin on the road now

and i wanna be free
mallorys pov we stare at mcclusky and scagnetti for a second
then like a bull we charge dolly straight at them
mallory screams o
we smash headfirst into the bars
mallorys pov flings up looking at the ceiling then falls backward
medium tight shot of floor mallory falls into frame out cold
cu on scagnetti through the cell bars
camera pans over to cu on mcclusky
dont worry about it
she does that all the time
back to mallory on the floor still unconscious with blood trickling down her scalp
camera is at the end of a long corridor
mcclusky and scagnetti approach from the other end
scagnettis studying the files
phil wurlitzer comes up behind the two men
you duckin me dewight
hey phil how the hell are ya
to scagnetti this son of a bitch is chairman of the prison board but its like pullin teeth to get him down to a prison
the only reason im here now is to set him straight and im on the next flight out

wurlitzer shakes hands with scagnetti
pleased to meet ya jack
i read your book
good work on curtis fox
from now on youll be dealin with phil
he can answer all the questions you got about the arrangements
im gonna be bidding you good luck and adieu in about twenty minutes
my flight back to sacramento leaves lax in a hour
and i want you to know well all cry a river when youre gone
they all laugh
whats the travelling arrangements
well mickey and mallory cant be together
so well put you on one of our prison busses and youll take mallory first then youll come back for mickey
and where do you keep mickey
we got his stinkin ass in the deepest darkest cell in the whole place
but it just so happens that right now hes got a special visitor
surprised wayne gayle
wayne gayle a young energetic commando journalist ala geraldo rivera is sitting on the visitor side of the county jail visiting area
wayne is alone and the visiting area is empty
apparently some arrangement was made for the visit
wayne has a miniature tape recorder in his hand and is testing it
into recorder testing one
over over over mickey knox meeting
wayne shuts off the recorder rewinds and plays it back
it works beautifully
he hits the record button and conceals the recorder in his sport coat jacket
the door opens on the prisoner side and mickey knox is lead into the room by two sheriffs deputies
mickeys wearing the country jail blue jump suit
he has a thick and wide leather belt around his waist with a metal ring built into each side
long sturdy chains with handcuffs on each end are wrapped across his body and through the rings binding his arms to his sides
his hands and feet are double cuffed
the deputies both have their guns drawn ready to blow mickey in half at the slightest provocation
for a man wrapped and bound in chains mickey seems strangely in control of his environment
even restrained as he is by the symbols of society the chains jail guards guns jump suit he remains a dangerous intimidating and fascinating figure
wayne takes in the image of mickey
to himself showtime
mickeys roughly shoved into his seat on the prisoners side of the glass
the deputies move to their place off to the side by the wall
weve never been introduced but im wayne gayle
i dont know if youve ever heard of me or remember me
i was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial everybody knows who you are
wayne pauses and retorts
i could say the same thing about you
smiles i want to thank you very much for seeing me
mickey is silent
i have a television show
its very popular
every week we do a profile on a different serial killer
you dont mind if i call you a serial killer do you
mickey shakes his head no
the episode we did on mickey and mallory was one of our most popular ones
did you ever do one on wayne gacy
whose ratings were higher
how bout ted bundy
ever do one on him
yours got the larger nielson share
yuppie piece of shit
what id like to do how bout manson
manson beat you
yeah its pretty hard to beat the king
weve been waiting to do a follow up episode on you for a long time
and that time has definitely come
pause i feel its apparent to anyone whos hip to whats going on that the prison board has thrown the constitution straight out the fuckin window
you and mallory may be killers but youre not insane
you belong in a prison not in an asylum
the prison board is blatantly railroading you into a hospital for the sole purpose of turning you into vegetables
now some people are saying so what
i am not one of those people
if we avert our eyes while they do this to you we give them permission to do it again whenever they see fit
today they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions are dangerous tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel what i say is dangerous
where does it all stop
no response from mickey
my problem mickey is that you dont exactly inspire empathy
im all alone on this
i need your help
i want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode
now i have interviews with chairman of the prison board dewight mcclusky about this issue
and im tellin ya mickey he looks bad
the two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court wont talk to us which always looks bad
i have an interview with both the judge of your trial bert steinsma and the psychologist and author emil reinghold both of which discount the notion that youre insane
you put that all together and what the state is doing becomes obvious
but the network isnt satisfied
they feel the show needs another element
it needs you
in order to put the show on the air i need to get an interview with you
you havent talked to the press since your trial
now a few days before you get transferred to an asylum you grant an interview on television with wayne gayle
were talkin a media event here
every son of a bitch out the with a tv sets gonna tune in to see that
well make their motives so blatant well shame em into dropping the whole thing
at least for a little while the publicity would keep them from just giving you and mallory lobotomies
well whatta ya say
have you talked to mallory about this
she wont even see me mickey
now youre not supposed to know anything about whats going on with her but im gonna tell ya somethin
since you twove been sentenced mallory hasnt spoken one word
she doesnt talk
not to anybody
what does she sing
hes a rebel leader of the pack town without pity that dusty springfield song i only want to be with you
thats what i hear anyway
her behaviour was the main thing the doctors report used against you
so even if she would see me which she wont i couldnt put her on camera anyway
if i ask her mallory are you insane
and she starts singing dead skunk in the middle of the road that blows our whole case
mickey cracks a smile
the guards come over to take him away
they grab mickey and jerk him from the chair
wait a minute mickey i need an answer
mickey doesnt respond
he just leaves with the guards
yells after him just think about it
but dont think too long
medium cu of mickey curled up by his bed writing mallory a letter
my cell is so cold
at night i get the chills
i pretend youre lying next to me holding me from behind with your leg draped over mine and your arms wrapped tightly around me
i lie in my cell
wide shot in cell behind mickey
we slowly dolly back
and imagine kissing you
not making love just kissing for hours and hours on end
i remember everything about our time
i remember every joke you ever told
cu of the letter being written over the wide shot
i remember every secret you ever shared
shared or revealed
i think shared is proper
i remember every single time you laughed
ecu of mickey mouthing the words as he writes we can hear mallorys laugh a distant haunting echo
i remember every meal we ever ate
i remember your cooking
i especially remember your casseroles
i remember watching david letterman
we hear the echo of television laughter
i remember driving fast
faster man fast behind the wheel of the coupe de ville
the sound of the coupe de ville swells until we
camera sits on the hood looking down at mickey and mallory driving fast slow motion
a hurricane of wind whips through their hair
mallory laughs wildly as she wraps her arms around mickey and kisses
you baby by my side
your bare feet up on the dash singing along with the radio needles and pins hes a rebel youre my world ring of fire love grows where my rosemary goes
coupe de ville parked on the road side
mickey is in the drivers seat with his feet on the dash watching mallory dance on the hood of the car
and your dancing my god your dancing
i lie on my bed and go over every day every minute of our happiness
every day take a day of our time and go through it hour by hour
i dont jump ahead either
i take it as it comes and i live that day again
that way when i get to our first kiss
the screen erupts with fire
mickey and mallorys faces appear in the flame kissing passionately
the killing of your parents our wedding
theyre not just memories
i feel that joy again
medium cu of wayne holding a piece of paper in front of his face and reading from it out loud
we hear waynes voice over mallorys singing before the last scene dissolves
reading out loud after taking a few days to reflect on your offer ive come to the conclusion that you are one hundred percent correct
a national tv interview would be very advantageous to both mallory and i
the only obstacle is theyre shipping me out to the funny farm in four days
however that is your problem and not mine
i feel confident youll manage
heres to us making television history
sincerely mickey knox
wayne drops the letter down from in front of his face
am i a god or what
we now see the restaurant adorned with the standard dennys decorum
waynes team is gathered in a booth that surrounds the remains of a greasy meal
in response to his last remark they all pretend they are praying to him
the team consists of scott the cameraman who wears wild t shirts presently a t shirt with the movie she devils on wheels splashed on the front roger the soundman
who wears wild hawaiian shirts and bermuda shorts and unruly julie waynes assistant a young lady who wears bermuda shorts a baseball jersey and a dark sports coat no matter how hot the weather is at any time
rogers never seen without his recorder scotts never without his camera and unruly julie always has her giant notebook
these dishevelled film types are all in their twenties and are a marked contrast to waynes stylish yuppie demeanour
unruly julie pops the cork on a champagne bottle
the guys hold out coffee mugs while julie fills
julie however drinks straight from the bottle
note this scene is to be played at a rapid fire his girl friday pace
this is a celebration
this is the day we received word we were gonna make television history
were gonna have the first sit down in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever one day before hes being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest
of his life
this is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalists career
this is wallace with noriega this is elton john confessing his bi sexuality to the rolling stone this is the tearful reporting of the hindenberg disaster this is truffaut setting
the record straight on hitchcock this is a robert capa photo this is woodward and bernstien meeting deep throat in an underground parking lot this is john reid reporting the ten days that shook the world this is the hippies bloody palms at kent state the maysles brothers at altamont this is the nixon frost interviews
this is raymond burr witnessing the destruction of tokyo by godzilla
whats the schedule mein fuehre
as wayne talks unruly julie writes furiously in her notebook
she never speaks just writes
we got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together
the day after that theyre shippin mallory
thats when we do the mickey knox interview cause the next day he goes
would the network really not run it without the interview
are you kidding
the last thing they expected was mickey knox to get up close and personal
they wanted a follow up episode and wouldve taken anything i had given them
im not gonna tell mickey knox that
im gonna make him think his grey matter depends on it
when i told woody and the brass about this coup they practically shit a brick
im talkin an adobe brick
they want to expand the show to a hour and they want it on immediately
how immediate is immediately
next weeks episode
waynes team all spit out mouthfuls of champagne
we dont got enough footage for a hour follow up
pointing at roger what he said
rape and pillage the first episode just change the order a bit
those sons of bitches out there aint gonna know the difference
all that shit is just filler for the interview anyway
we film a new intro
show some old footage from the first episode so the get a brief history of mickey and mallory
we introduce a new angle
what the prison board is up to
we see some of that new shit then the rest of the show is the interview
now whats so fuckin hard about that
oh julie make a note i need woody to get me thirty seconds of the live at five broadcast to promote next weeks show
well do a feed right from the jail while were wrapping up with mickey
unruly julie scribbles in her notebook
wayne snaps at scott
you too scott betacam and a remote keep it simple
scott closes his eyes in concentration and repeats wayne
betacam with remote and two way comm link
opens eyes how about the interview
what camera do you want to use
wayne closes his eyes
high contrast sixteen millimetre black and white and i mean black and white where the blacks black and the whites white
this is for posterity so fuck video
wayne pounds on the table
cu of unruly julie writing in her notebook film
so unruly julies comin with me and planning the interview
points at roger scott you two go down to the editing bay take the old footage and the new footage put it together and see what we got
get it into shape so when we finish the interview we can just stick it in
when do you want the assembly
camera leads wayne whos talking to unruly julie
as they march quickly through the halls julie writes furiously in her notebook
at that point ill ask him if he believes in god
if he says yes ill ask him what he thinks god would make of his actions
and is he worried about burning in hell
if he says no ill say well mickey what do you believe in
and hopefully hell say something like a live round of ammo the expression on the face of a man he just split up the middle mallorys eyes sex drugs and
rock n roll
hes bound to say something provocative
wayne and unruly julie enter the video editing room
scott and roger are sitting at the editing bay
everybody is wearing and looks like they slept in the same clothes as the night before except wayne whos in another sweater and looks alert and snappy
okay boys lets have it
well basically what we did was put part of the old show on first
but we changed the order around so it wasnt super obvious
then we added the new shit to the tail
so we film the interview and we can just slap it on at the end
wayne and unruly julie grab chairs and sit
okay lets see it
cu of video monitor screen
we see a show rewinding
now we got to film a new intro for the follow up episode
but we put the intro for the first episode at the beginning temporarily so you can see it with some scope
i hear ya
cu of rogers hand pressing a play button
then the opening slate for american maniacs fills the wayne gayle is standing in the middle of an empty highway
the camera looks up from the ground
with a wide angle lens he looks practically mythic
wayne speaks into the camera
welcome to american maniacs
im your host wayne gayle
and this is highway
wayne walks toward the camera
we dolly back
to some the fastest distance between point a and point b
to others a beautiful stretch to the american landscape
but to mickey and mallory knox it was a candy land of murder and mayhem
while we hear waynes narration we see a montage of home mm movie footage

this sequence is filmed in mm color cinema verite ala cops
the camera runs behind three blue windbreaker clad cops as they run up to the circle k shouting obscenities
in front of the store three windbreaker cops have mickey on the ground beating him with nightsticks
one cop lies on the ground near them holding his hands over his face screaming
to the left mallory is slugging it out with a windbreaker cop matching each other blow for blow
meanwhile the three cops we ran with reach the action and join in

they started off robbing type stores and gas stations and later graduated to banks and the big time
wayne gayle walks down the street
the camera walks with him
he speaks into the camera
mickey and mallorys idea of an armed robbery was a little different than most
it was an assault actually
wayne interviews bishop a young blonde kid with a flock of sea gulls haircut
bishops name appears on the screen
i knew that mickey and mallory kill everybody when theyre through except for one clerk
there were a couple of people in the store then and i was working with stevo
and i like stevo you know
but i was thinking what could i do to make them pick me to be the clerk that gets to live
this scene is shot through the stores black white video surveillance camera

mickey points his shotgun at bishop the store clerk and screams money
faster than that
bishop stuffs money in a bag as mallory guards the door shotgun ready
stevo the other store clerk walks in from the back room carrying boxes and wearing a walkman
mickey and mallory spin around and shoot him
as all this mayhem happens before our disbelieving eyes waynes narration happens over it
theyd storm in with shotguns and kill every customer in the place right off the bat
smiling photos of other victims
we cut from each photo to the next photo after shotgun fire
wayne gayle sitting on football bleachers
he stares into the camera for a few beats

wayne talks to us
apparently bored with banditry and murder the two outlaws proved what renaissance psychopaths they really are
to break up the monotony in between bank jobs or what have you they started butchering whole households at random
cut to montage of newspaper front page stories and headlines of family households butchered by the knoxs
wayne dressed in a pink shirt and suspenders talks to us in front of a blue screen that has wayne gayles american maniacs logo behind him
unfortunately the story didnt end with their capture
it just became more surreal
their subsequent trial turned into a sick circus
the camera captures the crowd in front of the courthouse
theyre a very mixed lot
as spectators reporters law students tourists gawkers the interested the curious the devoted and the demented were drawn to the los angeles county courthouse like moths to a flame
wayne talks to us
the mickey and mallory knox murder trial was so event filled it made the crime spree that took place before pale by comparison
the first point was the decision of mickeys to act as his own council
now this in itself is not unheard of for instance ted bundy acted as his own council as well
what was unexpected was how well mickeys performance would be
wayne interviews judge burt steinsma in his den at home
we spoke with burt steinsma who was the presiding judge during the knox trial
mickey was surprisingly effective
when i was told i was to be the judge of this trial and then i was told mickey knox would be handling his own defence i got a headache
that lasted five days
but at first i breathed a sigh of relief
mickey showed up very prepared and proved to be an excellent amateur lawyer
interview with state prosecutor wanda bisbing an attractive woman in her forties
however this opinion isnt shared by the states prosecutor on this case wanda bisbing
waynes with bisbing
judge steinsma said that mickey showed up very prepared and proved to be an excellent amateur attorney
oh thats rich
well considering that mickey knox turn his court into a mockery and personally made him look like a fool id say thats very benevolent of judge steinsma
as far as mickey being an excellent amateur lawyer maybe im old fashioned but when i went to law school we were taught the object was to win the case
which i did
wayne talks to us
the nation caught fire to mickey and mallory fever mickey and mallory mania if you will as the merits to mickeys talent as a defence attorney became apparent
law students from all ends of the country converged on los angeles as legal history took a new course
but that was only the lemon next to the pie
and that pie is you the american people
that pie is the way the strangely charismatic and make no mistake they are charismatic mickey and mallory have captured the publics interest fear and in some cases admiration
wayne interviews three long haired guys chuck steve and jeff

cut to wayne interviewing russell vossler harvard law student
tell me mr
vossler how many days of the trial have you attended
ahhh yesss ive been fortunate enough to attend two days
law history in the making
ive been a participant
and you being a harvard law student what is your opinion of mickey knoxs performance
ahhh mickeys pistolero savvy in the courtroom trial rivals dare i say conquers that of master melvin belli
hes like a magnificent loose cannon firing point blank in the prosecutors face
it is my anticipation back to the long haired guys chuck jeff steve as wayne speaks
youre talking about a man and a woman who killed innocent people
dont get us wrong
we respect human life an all
its a tragedy
if i was a serial killer which im not but if i was id be like mickey
cut to wayne talking with marvin a black man
theyre like that crazy mother in the first dirty harry movie
member that crazy ass mother
theyre like him
mickey and mallory be doin some cold blooded shit
when i hear about some of the shit they be doin on tv i say damn thats fucked bleep up
back to the two young girls morgan page as wayne speaks
laughing and blushing we sit in the courtroom all day and try to catch mickeys eye
waynes sitting in the gym
behind him muscle men are working out
their grunting sounds fill the background
wayne looks up and just off camera to the people hes interviewing
what do you think of mickey and mallory
ecu on simon and norman hun two brothers bodybuilders in a head shot
i admire them
i do too
confused but how can you say that
have you seen pumping iron
then youve seen the scene where arnold schwartzenegger is talking to lou ferigno
through the power of the simple word and a snake eye glare
and a snake eye glare arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence ferigno had
he squashed him mentally before physically defeating him
he had the edge
the minds edge
mickey and mallory have that edge
only on a much grander scale
theyve hypnotized the nation
schwartzenegger was the king of the edge before they came along
the cu of the brothers zooms back
you say this and yet
you two are both victims of mickey and mallory
shot has zoomed back to reveal that both simon and norman are in wheelchairs their legs maimed or gone
how can you say that you admire them
its like this wayne
two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack
these two people cant see each other yet they know theyre there
now they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom or one of them can make the first move
why cant they just shake hands and be friends
they cant because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the knoxs
so you may as well make the first move
and they made the first move
but you see thats okay wayne
they passed the edge along to us
by taking away our legs
now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else youll find in this gym
probably the whole city
they gave us the fighting spirit
before this happened i was content
now im pissed off
now im half a man and ive got to work like the devil to get whole again
but youll never be whole again
never is a very long time wayne
a word only the weak use
im not a sore loser
even if i dont have a leg to stand on im going to get up and fight this world until im on top again
thats the mickey and mallory way
thats the way of the world
theyre shocking the world into remembering the primal law
survival of the fittest
one last question
usually mickey and mallory kill all of their victims
why did they let you two survive
the brothers pause then turn to wayne
they had us tied down during one of their house raids youve seen the headlines and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us
just for fun i guess
and then mallory stops mickey and says hey these are the brothers hun
mickey stops sawin on my leg and says oh my god im your biggest fan
apparently theyve seen all our films
they were especially influenced by conquering huns of neptune
so mallory calls and they took off
they actually apologized
the couple proved so popular that a motion picture glamorizing their exploits was made
cut to a poster for the mickey and mallory movie called thrill killers is shown
it has a drawing of the movie mickey and movie mallory in a romantic pose ala gone with the wind both with guns in their hands
around them are smaller drawings of cars people shooting people fighting explosions etc
the adlines are ripped from todays headlines the true story the poster lists the credits starring jessie alexander warwick and buffy st
written and directed by neil pope
the movie thrill killers proved to be a tremendous box office success making stars out of the before then unknown cut to stills of movie mickey and movie mallory holding
weapons posing together creating mayhem
actors jessie alexander warwick and buffy st

shot of movie mickey and movie mallory driving fast and laughing their heads off
together theyre the thrill killers
the true story of the couple that shocked the world
shot of the movie knoxs firing guns
with a bloodlust of violence
shot of movie mickey and movie mallory kissing
and unbridled passion
shot of movie mallory with a knife to a cops throat
movie mickey holds a shotgun
when society catches up with you id hate to be in your boots
let me telly ya about society and its boots
it uses those boots for steppin on people like me and her
wayne enters an editing room where filmmaker neil pope is working at a movieola
we talked with neil pope writer and director of thrill killers for his take on the mickey and mallory phenomena
pope stops the movieola turns toward the camera and greets wayne m
it is my belief that mickey and mallory knox are a cultural phenomena that could only exist in our sexually repressed society
a flower that could only bloom amidst a grotesque fast food culture
a what i tried to do with thrill killers was trace the root of the problem all the way down the vine to the original bad seed
yet amidst the violence and murder and carnage youve got the structure of a wagnerian love story
in a back alley the conclusion of thrill killers plays out
the sound of sirens and choppers are nearing
movie mickey shotgun in hand runs down the alley stopping at a dumpster where the wounded and bloody movie mallory sits propped up against a brick wall
on the bottom of the screen the subtitle appears scene from thrill killers
mickey honey listen to me
movie mallory holds out her hand for him to take it
i cant go
im too fucked up
im not saying its not gonna hurt but i cant run with you mickey
i really want to
if i could i would but i cant
i gotta stay here
but you can still get out of here
no fuckin way
no fuckin way
if they stay theyll catch you and they dont have to catch you no fuckin way
mickey youre wasting time
i dont give a damn if a million united states marines all whistling the halls of montezuma are gonna come marchin down this alley any second
there aint not fuckin way in hell im leaving you
and thats that
movie mallory grabs his hand with both of hers
the siren and chopper sounds are getting closer
mickey my love if you leave me theyll catch me and take me to the hospital
if you stay youll make em kill you
then itd be like i killed you
i could bear anything but i couldnt bear that
so please please for me my handsome husband run for your life
the sirens and choppers draw closer
i cant do it
youre my wife youre my partner
a fella doesnt run when his partner cant run with him
mallory my angel if i could of left ya id of left ya a long time ago
well hell if you wont leave give me a gun so i can go out shooting
movie mickey hands her his
magnum from his belt
im gonna make it a little tougher for em
movie mickey runs to the end of the alley peers around the corner at the arriving cops
to himself time to get naked and boogie
movie mallory is out of movie mickeys view
she cocks the
then places the barrel under her chin
movie mickeys busy
he doesnt turn around
you made every day like kindergarten
movie mallory pulls the trigger
dolly down the alley to a cu on mickey as he spins around
movie mallory literally blew her head clean off
her headless body gun in hand remains upright in her sitting position
movie mickey runs toward her screaming her name in slow motion
why did you kill mallory
both of them are still alive
it was dramatic license no doubt
but i felt an operatic love story needed an operatic ending
the two of them kill for each other
they offer the death of their victims to each other like other lovers offer flowers or bon bons
so what more natural what more organic what more poetic than mallory offering her death to mickey
its where its been leading since day one
we worked it in the movie by using a what if they escaped situation
i think it works beautifully
youd be surprised
people come up to me at the end of the movie in tears
actor jessie alexander warwick sits on his motorcycle and talks to the camera
hes dressed in a levis jacket jeans a bandanna is wrapped around his head and as he talks he bogarts a smoke
his name appears at the bottom of the screen
one thing about mickey for sure hes definitely a man who has his moments
it was wild playin him
it was one of those get it out of your system performances
this interview is shot in buffys house ala barbara walters
buffy sits on the couch in her living room with a cat in her lap
from time to time she sips from a coffee cup
her name appears at the bottom of the screen
i didnt play mallory the murderer
i didnt play her as a butcher
i played her as a woman in love who also happens to murder people
i didnt want her to be at arms length from the audience or myself
if you play her as this wild maniac the audience never has to deal with her
if you see a decapitation in a movie you just say oh wow a neat special effect
because you cant relate to a decapitation
it doesnt mean anything to anybody because its not personal
decapitations dont fall into most peoples realm of life experiences
but if you show somebody in a movie getting a paper cut the whole audience squirms
because everybody can relate to a paper cut
did you meet the real mallory knox
i tried to but she wouldnt see me
but i read some letters she wrote to mickey before the murder spree
they helped me out a lot
jessie talks to camera
you met mickey knox didnt you
yeah i visited him when he was up in susanville
hes a little cerebral for my taste but all in all we got along
wayne sitting in a chair in front of a desk interviews dr
reinghold who sits behind the desk
to get a psychiatric view on the strange attraction mickey and mallory seems to have we talked with doctor emil reinghold noted psychologist and author
wayne begins his interview
can you shed some light doctor reinghold on why the public has taken a pair of sociopaths so close to their bosom
well for one the media has done a tremendous job of turning the husband and wife mass murderers into celebrities
but its the countrys youth who have turned the couple into the ultimate anti heroes
basically the very thing that makes them most lethal is the exact same thing that captures the publics hearts and minds mickey and mallorys operatic devotion to each other
in a world where people cant seem to make the simplest relationships work and the slightest emotional commitment is considered devastating mick and mallory have a do or die romance
of a shakespearean magnitude
to the countrys youth percent of which are coming from broken homes thats appealing
they have an us against the world posture which always appeals to youth
and theyve taken that posture seventeen steps beyond
its not us against the world its were gonna kill the world
i read their file and i find myself turning the page like it was a paperback
why do disillusioned youths get into mickey and mallory
why do disillusioned housewives read romance novels
why are you filming this special
because you know as well as i do you say tonight at nine charles manson speaks everybodys going to tune in to hear what he says
mickey and mallory have shocked a country numb with violence
theyve created a world where only two exist and anybody who inadvertently enters that world is murdered
shots of the crowd
this attitude from the young towards their ultimate anti heroes is nation wide
boy and girl dressed like the knoxs
you take all the great figures from the states
elvis jack keroac bukowski james dean jim morrison angela davis jack nicholson jim thompson martin scorcese
add a bloody pale of nitro and you got mickey and mallory
theyre like rebels without a cause except they have a cause
only nobody knows what it is
screaming their cause is each utter
two japanese teens a boy and girl dressed like the knoxs
they speak in japanese which is translated in english
as japanese boy and girl speak we hear keep the faith mickey and mallory keep the faith
two french teens a boy and girl dressed like the knoxs
they speak in french and we hear the translation in english
mickey and mallory have a love thats in english they are super cool
and as to almost give this whole misplaced admiration scenario a cherry on the top the rock band redd kross entered the charts last week at number with their song
natural born killers the saga of mickey and mallory
cut to a clip from the redd kross video of natural born killers
the third wicked twist to this story is grace mulberry
front page newspaper headline reads mickey and mallory kill six teens during slumber party
in smaller bold face under it one teen escapes killers clutches
on the front page is a photo of the teen who escaped
its seventeen year old grace mulberry
camera moves in cu of the photo
of the six teens murdered that night seventeen year old grace mulberry was the lucky one left to tell the tale
and this haunted young lady summoned up the courage to take the stand tell what she saw that horrible night and then allow herself to be cross examined by the
man who killed her brother and girlfriends
all kinds of people are gathered around
its a real media event
graces sedan pulls up to the courthouse
the many spectators and reporters surround the car
grace her father and bisbing emerge from the sedan and start walking up the courthouse steps
microphones and cameras are thrust at her as reporters ask questions
grace is afraid to face the crowd
her head darts in the direction of each question but she doesnt answer
she remains silent and scared
how does it feel to be the only survivor of mickey and mallorys reign of terror
has the experience marked you
some scruffy transient sticks his head in graces face
did ya watch your brother get stabbed up
how do you feel about mickey cross examining you
grace her father and bisbing shove their way through the crowd
after grace and her entourage enter the courthouse we hear the cry of mickey and mallory
camera whips toward the bottom of the steps as the car carrying mickey and mallory pulls up
the reporters race down the steps they just raced up
the mickey and mallory fans go apeshit
mickey and mallory handcuffed are being led up the steps by sheriffs deputies
wayne gayle and other reporters film them and shoot out questions
microphones are thrust into their faces
mickey how do you feel about cross examining grace mulberry
im keen with anticipation
what do you think of this turn out mallory
i aint never had so much fun
a cute reporter a tawny little type steps forward
do you have any regrets
not a one
yeah i always regretted we never got around to looking up my old history teacher miss bainbridge
now theres a big bad bitch not good for herself or nobody
whats your favorite pastime
you mean aside from what im being tried for
mallory playfully elbows mickey in his ribs
oh id say watching tv
all the reporters in unison whats your favorite show
have gun will travel
do you have anything to say to your fans
looking in camera you aint seen nothin yet
wayne by himself standing on the courthouse steps
to camera no apparently we had not seen everything
grace mulberry gave her tearful testimony
then it became mickey knoxs turn for cross examination
court sketches an artist sketch of mickey cross examining grace on the stand
grace was terrified of mickey
you have to understand most of their victims were normal people with normal lives that nothing out of the ordinary ever happens to
court sketch of mickey looking like the devil himself
then out of the blue theyre dealing with the devil incarnate
it was extremely difficult for us to find survivors who would take the stand and testify when they knew mickey would be cross examining them
court sketch of terrified grace
camera closes in graces face
grace was every bit as terrified every bit as haunted
but she felt her brother tim and her five girlfriends were counting on her
court sketch cu of grace staring intently
camera widens to include bisbing standing before the bench as mickey sits with mallory at the defence table
judge steinsma looks down at grace
the distinct sounds of a court in session can be heard in the b
the color of the scene fades to black white as the camera cranes up to reveal the court artist drawing while court is in session
off screen bisbing is wrapping up her examination of grace who is at the witness stand
judge steinsma resides at his bench
camera dollies into a med
overhead two shot of mickey and mallory who are sketching on a pad of paper
camera reveals the drawing of a man stabbing a woman
mickey is doing the actual drawing but every once and a while mallory takes to pencil and adds some touches as grace finishes her tearful testimony
no further questions your honor
emotional pause the silence
would you care to cross examine the witness mr
mickey scratches out the drawing
still holding the pencil he stands and leaves frame
as a matter of fact your honor i would
note the following scene is to be played with extreme close ups
not once is the courtroom seen in detail
however courtroom sound can be heard vividly in the b
cu of mallory who grins at mickey like a cheshire cat
cu of graces eyes as they look downward
cu of judge steinsma as he shuffles paper on his bench
cu of mickeys feet crossing the court floor
cu of bisbing as her eyes follow mickey across the court
mickey enters the frame with a pencil pressed to his lips in though
mickey is looking straight into the camera
mickeys pov of grace sitting on the witness stand staring into her lap
ecu of graces finger rolling a large male style high school class ring around her palm
cu of mickey glancing to the ring
mickeys pov of grace as she pulls from a reserve of strength
clenching the ring tight in her fist her eyes come up and lock hatefully on mickey
cu mickey as he walks forward towards grace
thats one helluva story miss mulberry
cu of grace
yes it is
at this point mickey begins to pace from right to left but always remaining in cu
i hope you dont mind if i call you grace
back to grace as we dolly from a med cu into a ecu
id like to talk to you about your late brother tim if you feel up to it
continue dolly once locked onto her eyes her head drops forward and we
ecu of graces eyes as her head is pulled back into frame
her eyes are wide with fear
the camera pulls back to reveal a gag in her mouth and a knife pressed against her throat
shes back at the night of the murder
mickeys wearing a black leather jacket over a white t shirt which is covered with blood
blood is smeared on his face and hes holding a knife pressed to his lips also covered with blood
but hes walking and talking with the same manner and poise as in the courtroom
i hope you dont mind if i call you grace
two shot revealing that grace is bound and gagged with mallory right behind her holding the knife and cracking gum
naw she dont mind
id like to talk to you about your murdered brother tim if you feel up to it
cu of grace in a daze
did you get along
mickey waits for an answer that doesnt come
back to grace
more or less
more or less
back to mickey
what do you mean by that
back to grace
well hes my older brother
when we were growing up there were times we could of very well done without each other
but when it counted we were close
cu of bisbing listening
grace is doing better than she thought
camera pans from shadows to find mickey the pan continues through his line
id like to talk about tims martial arts abilities
how long had he been studying
pan continues back into the shadows then degrees to find grace
he started when he was in the seventh grade so that would make it nine years
pan continues back into shadows then
camera pans from darkness into a well lit martial arts class room in full session
tim mulberry and expert martial artist is competing against a lesser opponent while their master looks on
camera pans back into shadows then
camera pans from darkness and locks on a cu of mickey
when you study the martial arts they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level youre at in your training
am i correct on that point
yes you are
what was the color of tims belt
the style of fighting that tim studied didnt believe in belts
is that a fact
well then grace could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that tim was schooled in
tim studied several styles but his favorite was jeet kune do
jeet kune do
now i did some research on that form of fighting and i found out that jeet kune do was a style developed by bruce lee
did you know that
yes i did
thats why tim studied it
because it was bruce lees fighting style
cu of court clerks hands typing in slow motion
now while i freely admit total ignorance on the subject i have heard of bruce lee
and i was under the impression that bruce lee was one of the if not the greatest fighter in the history of martial arts
thats what tim said
so i think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that bruce lee arguably the greatest martial artist of all times developed for nine
years that would be a fella who could defend himself
would you describe tim that way grace
yes i would
mickey points at grace with the pencil in his hand
point of fact werent tims hands registered as lethal weapons
yes they were
cu of mickeys hand holding the pencil
that means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife
am i correct on that point
yes you are
cu of mallory cracking a slight smile
yet in your testimony just now you described that tim
camera moves into a tight cu of grace
her eyes widen
kicked me four times in the head
insert the night of the murder
tim cuts loose and hammers mickey with four punishing kicks to the head
cu of mickey
and his trained martial artists kicks had little to no effect
camera is low angle as tim backs up after his attack
we notice the high school ring he wears on his right fist as he steps into a fighting stance ready for mickey to drop
mickey however spits out a stream of blood and smiles at him
cu of mickey
then after shrugging off four blows to the head like i was superman i lifted tim nine years of jeet kune do mulberry off the ground and threw him across
mickey with arms raised over his head pantomimes throwing tims body
wide shot as tim flies into frame crashing into the living room wall
we quickly pan down a number of items with white evidence tags on them
we stop at mickeys buck knife
mickeys hand comes into frame and picks up the knife
then i took
cu of mickey as he brings the knife into frame
this knife and proceeded to tear him limb from limb
and this man whose hands are lethal weapons cu of bisbing as she stands
objection defence is intimidating the witness with the murder weapon
knox put the knife down
mickey is locked on grace
mickey contd had little to no defence
yelling i dont know how you did it but you did it
mickey glances to the judge then slowly places the knife back on the table
how do you think a human being could possibly be capable of doing something like that
mickey locks eyes with eyes
yelling i dont know
mickey is on top of her
i dont believe that grace
i think you have a definite opinion on how i was able to do those things you described
now im going to ask you again
and i want you to remember you are under oath
grace collects herself
in your opinion miss mulberry how was i able to murder you brother tim mulberry in the manner you described
the judge looks down at grace
grace looks back into her open palm
cu of the ring
back to mickey bearing down on her waiting for an answer
back to grace as we slowly dolly closer she looks up at mickey timidly
softly youre not human
i thought about it a lot
and the only thing i could figure is that youre not human
bisbing hides her disappointment by looking down
mickey straightens up as grace continues
youre a vampire or the devil or a monster or cyborg or something like that
but youre not human
grace breaks down
putting her hands to her head to stop the pain
cu of mickey smiling down at her

cu judge steinsma betraying no emotion looks down at grace

after the deadly brewhaha in the courtroom the judge honorable burt steinsma passed down a sentence that was to make legal history
interview with judge steinsma in his den at home
shot of wayne and judge talking
we spoke with retired judge steinsma at his home in baltimore maryland
the interview was there any vengeance on your part with your unique sentence
after they did what they did in my court and judge worth his robe will tell you the same thing
it couldnt help but affect my decision
thats why they have judges
were supposed to be fair to a fault but when its showtime we have to make a decision
thats why we dont just input all the facts into a computer for the appropriate punishment
i couldnt give them the death penalty
see california hops back and forth on that issue
mickey and mallory went to court when it was out of favor which is actually good because it leaves more room for imagination
anybody can give somebody the chair
when you have someone who deserves to die and you cant kill them you have to be creative
and if the bastards had let it stand it would of been the perfect sentence
it hit em right where they lived
far more punishing than the death sentence
would you please describe for our viewers what your sentence was
well in a rogues gallery of killers mickey and mallory are very unique
ive seen a lot of killers in my day and theyre a very cold lot
they have no more feelings about taking a persons life than squashing a tiny bug
its all the same to them
well mickey and mallory were that kill em to watch their expression change attitude personified
except with each other
and since they lived only for each other i wanted to attack that at its very root
so in a nutshell my sentence was double life for each without any possibility for parole
that would be fairly standard in their case
the twist i added was that the husband and wife would have no contact or correspondence with each other for the rest of their lives
and they would never receive any word or information about the other
so basically once the cell door slams shut mickey and mallory will completely disappear from each others life
theyll never know when the other dies
but alas the best laid plans of mice and men
mallory in tears hysterically actually is cuffed hand to foot and being dragged by sheriffs deputies into the prison bus
reporters throw out questions photographers shoot photos tv news people capture the moment on video
the bus pulls out onto the street
photo mickey in prison uniform being led by guards
photo shot though bars of mallory in her cell
her back is to the camera
the sentence was never to reach that point
because after only a year mickey and mallory created so much mayhem that it was decided
that they were mentally ill and needed to be transferred to a state mental hospital
camera move into the picture of mickey and mallory on the front page of the newspaper

we talked with dewight mcclusky chairman of the california state prison board about this curious turn of events in the mickey and mallory case

why are mickey and mallory being moved to an asylum
and who made the decision
the prison board made the decision
a board of which i belong
were the who
the why is simple
mickey and mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctors care where hopefully theyll receive the help they need
mickey and mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial
well since that time theyve killed one person during their trail
and since their incarceration theyve killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates
when they were found competent before they had already killed fifty people
other than the fact theyre a disciplinary problem which frankly shouldnt surprise anyone i still dont see where this situation is any different then it was before
so i ask you again mr
mcclusky whats changed
whats changed mr
gayle is our minds
we felt they were competent a year ago
a year has passed sir a year where they were under close observation day in and day out and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong
who is we
the prison board and the doctors who examined them
were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the knoxs mental state asked to re examine them
using the same doctors is not common practice
i take it by your answer it was a whole new team
now that you bring it up yes
they were different men
i hadnt really thought that much about it
since many psychiatric opinions are by a rule sought out for this kind of situation
what do you think normally happens
the knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives
the state doesnt work like that
photo of dr
the two psychiatric opinions the board sought were those of albert rodriguez
photo of dr
both of the good doctors for whatever reason refused to be interviewed
back with dr
its a funny situation actually
if anyone besides mickey and mallory give a damn what the prison board is doing would be considered an outrage
the prison board is basically saying we cant handle these guys
theyve moved em around twice since their sentence started
they were a handful everywhere they went
now the prisons theyre at now want them outta there
but no other prisons gonna be stupid enough to take em
so the prison board is left scratching their heads wondering what theyre gonna do
well what they decided to do was to set up a kangaroo medical court that found them crazy
then they get them transferred to nystrom medical asylum or lobotomy bay as its referred to in the psychiatric circle
put em on a strict dope and electro shock diet and mickey and mallory cease to be a problem to anybody except the orderlies who clean out the bedpans which
if you want to see them get theirs thats all well and good
but theres something being said here
forget the immorality for a second
forget the corruption and the skulduggery involved
what the board is saying is we give up
mickey and mallory ran amuck in polite society
they were put in an alternative society and they ran amuck there too
all the powers that be cant deal with these two kids
and whatever cant be assimilated has to be terminated
so in your opinion mickey and mallory are not insane
a menace to living creatures yes
but to suggest that theyre insane gives the impression that they dont know right from wrong
mickey and mallory know the difference between right and wrong
they just dont give a damn
freeze frame on dr
waynes just finished viewing the show
he puts his hands on scott and rogers shoulders
good work my brothers
fan fuckin tastic
i think that interview stuffs too long we can lose some of that
keep the girls keep the long hairs keep the hun brothers keep the black guy keep the movie shit and keep the cop at the donut shop
lose the rest
and cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that
cut it after i ask i take it by your answer it was a whole new team
dont even let him answer
then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in dr
wayne puts his arm around unruly julie
children we have a show
to scott roger you two get some long well overdue sleep
cause tomorrow bright and early county jail and then journeys end
mickeys pacing back and forth in his cell trying out different jokes
theres this italian guy a french guy and a polish guy
and theyre all talkin about how they fuck their wives you know im gonna just rip off your dress and squeeze your titties
then little red riding hood whips out her
sticks it in the big bad wolfs face and says no youre not
youre gonna eat me
just like the story says
with a lisp fairy boat
i knew things were good in here but i didnt know we had our own navy
so this guy wants to take little johnnys sister to the drive in
but the mother says only if you take little johnny along and the polish guy says thats nothing
when i get through with my hanna i get up wipe my dick on the curtain and she hits the roof
mickeys pretending hes calming down a hysterical audience
youre too kind
through scotts camera were filming this in black and white mm
note everytime were viewing through scotts camera we are filming handheld in mm black and white
until otherwise specified the shots stay in scotts camera
scotts filming the back of the newsvan
rogers sitting in the back eating donuts as is wayne
unruly julies up front driving
with mouthful of donut hows it working scotty
rogers picking through a box of donuts
scott pans over to him then slowly zooms in on him
where the fucks the chocolate cream filled
did anyone get my chocolate cream filled
if you did its mine
cu of roger looking into camera
i pointed at a chocolate cream filled
you saw me do it didnt you
wayne starts talking
we pan from roger to a cu of wayne
you were there
did you see him put it in a box
we pan back to a cu of roger
at the time i was too busy explaining to scott the finer points of film
we zoom back to a wide shot
you know what he said
he said indiana jones and the temple of doom is spielbergs best film
wayne starts laughing
we hear scott laugh too
to roger you cant be serious
preoccupied im as serious about that as i am about going back to the donut store and dipping that stupid mexicans head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream
gimme that other box
this dozen is for mickey
that dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake
whats the big deal
take out my chocolate cream filled put one of these roasted coconut roger do you understand what the word no means
its important we establish a rapport
something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasnt had a donut in a year
so youre giving a man who butchers whole families little babies included my chocolate cream filled
unruly julie honks the horn
wayne gets up and looks out the windshield
okay guys were here
julie just park in the front
wayne roger im starting to get pissed
just drop this fuckin donut shit and gather your gear
the van stops
wayne slides open the panel door and steps out
back to color mm
wayne hops out of the van and is approached by superintendent phil wurlitzer whos followed by two deputy sheriffs
aside to scott heres the welcome wagon
wurlitzer reaches them and shakes waynes hand
im phil wurlitzer
we talked on the phone
its a pleasure to meet you
let me introduce my crew
and unruly julie this is
whats your title again
im the superintendent here at l
me and my deputies are who youll be working with while youre here
that sounds great
look i dont want any of this to intimidate you
this is not going to be a big deal
this is going to be very easy
to his crew i need to talk with mr
you guys get your equipment ready power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote
julie come with me
julie tosses the keys to roger and shadows wayne as he speaks confidentially to wurlitzer
the main thing i need is a big room shut off from the population so we can get some privacy
with a few electrical outlets
wayne and his crew have set up in the food supply room off from the cafeteria
being big roomy and unpopulated its perfect for an interview
theres eight l
county deputy sheriffs around the room along with wurlitzer
rogers setting up his sound equipment while unruly julie is checking her notebook
wurlitzer and a few deputies talk among themselves
camera moves from person to person without cutting
to two deputies this is just for an interview i was on the set of dukes of hazzard once
it was a much bigger deal than this
they had a crew of maybe seventy five people
camera moves to wayne and scott
were gonna be talking over here
but i want enough freedom so if i wanna get up and move around we can
wayne grabs scott and walks him to the left
take him and walk him over this way
pretending scotts mickey so mickey killing mallorys parents what the hell was that all about
pauses to scott then maybe take him to the window
he walks scott to the window
pretending scotts mickey so mickey if you were let outta jail today whats the first thing youd do
pause to scott little shit like that
i dont wanna have to feel i gotta stay in the chairs
were after a cinema verite anything can happen truth twenty four times a second kindda feel
end of single shot
wurlitzers talking with deputies
and when its lunch time they dont just go to mcdonalds
they got cooks there servin great food
wayne walks over to wurlitzer and deputies
hows everything coming mr
everythings coming along just fine
phil i wanted to know if i could have a small word with you
by all means
wayne puts his hand on wurlitzers shoulder
they walk around the room
you met the kids i have working for me
great bunch arent they
oh yes indeed
scott genius cameraman roger magician with sound
unruly julie i could sooner do without my arm than unruly julie
is that her real name
just a little nickname
yep theyre my kids and theyre all i need
after working together these past coupla years were like well oiled machinery
no more like a formula race car
no scratch that one too
what were really like is a swiss watch
small intricate compact
it shouldnt work as well as it does but it does
because of the craftsmanship the expertise and the artists loving hand
wayne gives wurlitzer a moment to digest this
now phil i dont know if youve ever been on a set before proudly ya know i was
acting surprised really
i was on the dukes of hazzard set about eight years ago
still acting surprised well
well then you know firsthand how hollywood does things
lights all over the place generators a hundred and fifty crew members oh that dukes of hazzard show there was probably ninety five people there maybe more
see what i mean
its a funny business isnt it
it sure is
they got a asshole over here
pointing to his left a asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there
points to his right a asshole perched up there
points straight up assholes everywhere
hey maybe if we were doin that kiss kiss bang bang stuff wed need all those assholes too
what were about is intimacy
were about two people having a conversation
say i was interviewing you
all i want you to worry about is what i ask you
i want a trust to develop
if youre thinking about all this
indicates the hustle and bustle of a set youre not going to relax a trust wont develop well be talking a each other instead of to each other there will
be no chance for intimacy
wayne gives wurlitzer a chance to take this in
thats why my crew is only three
an invisible three
switching gears which brings me to what i wanted to talk to you about
i have to get mickey knox to relax
mickey knox to share what hes never shared before
mickey knox to open doors which till today have been closed
well how can we expect him to do that when we got los angeles county sheriffs up the walls
suddenly things get short between the two men
snorts well just what the hell do you expect me to do
gayle do you have the slightest idea how dangerous knox is
wurlitzer i assure you i am very familiar with mickey knoxs career
theyre out and out angry
since he and his wife have been in custody theyve killed dont recite the fact to me
im sure i know em better than you do
well let me let you in on one more fact you obviously dont know
if i were to take my men away mickey knox would snap your neck like a twig
i can take care of myself
i grew up in a tough neighbourhood and ive handled some pretty rough customers in my day
mickey knox doesnt scare me
im a journalist and im prepared to take that risk
it aint gonna happen
believe me when i tell you it is in mickey knoxs own best interest to play this game according to hoyle
pause wait a minute
weve gotten into a advisory relationship here which is not what i want
pause but seriously phil look at this
wayne scans the room counting the deputy sheriffs
counting we got one
i mean jesus christ phil thats too much
lets lose some of these guys
wayne if it was anybody else phil im just scared hes gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place
they hate him
he hates them
what kinda intimacy am i gonna create with all this hate in the air
even you and i feel it
what are we talking about
ill take two guys off
no no no no no no i mean only two guys
i cant do that
ill cut it in half
four guys but thats it
mickey lays on his bed with his hands behind his head
camera dollies back to include the bars of mickeys cell door in the f
as two deputy sheriffs enter frame and slide it open
the deputies each carry shotguns and a shit load of chains and shackles
on your feet
turn your face to the wall
mickey gets up
now what youre supposed to say is five minutes mr
off screen the cell door slams closed
cu of mallory asleep in her bunk
the echo of mickeys cell door makes her up with a jolt
rise and shine mallory
mallory springs out of bed and into a fighting stance
camera whip pans to scagnetti inside her cell flanked by two deputies with shotguns
the deputies are bingham and beautiful day for a drive isnt it
cu of mallorys bare feet walking in front of bingham and washingtons shiny black shoes
the sound of mallorys bare feet slapping the concrete floor along with the clip clop clip clop of the deputies shoes reverberates throughout the scene
mallory walks slightly ahead of the two shotgun wielding deputies when scagnetti slips in beside her
he lights up a cigarette with his zippo and talks a long drag
its a long trip to bakersfield
long and hot
ever been to bakersfield
mallory looks straight ahead
see ive been there twice
and im not lookin forward to goin back
but im in and out
you on the other hand sweetheart are gonna spend the rest of your life there
now thats what i call cruel and inhuman punishment
mallory shows no emotion just keeps on walking
course youre not gonna give a shit
cause when the good doctors get through givin you the zap
he puts his finger next to his temple pantomimes being electrocuted you wont know where the hell you are
theyll just put you on a window sill and water you every other day
mallory lets out a big yawn
wayne stands at the window speaking to scott roger and unruly julie
one the other side of the room wurlitzer and his entourage of deputies are yucking it up and occasionally bursting into laughter
to his crew and when he gets here its no dickn around time
make him up clip a mike on him then leave him alone
i dont want you talking to him
i dont want you getting in his face
i want you hiding behind your gear
you are invisible
camera pans to the door as two deputies lead mickey into the supply room
mickey is shackled head to toe its a wonder how he can still walk
to his crew okay break
waynes team disburses
okay boys lets start undoing him
two deputies hold shotguns to mickeys head while two others start unlocking the chains
as they do mickey looks at wayne
wayne approaches mickey
to wayne okay now before we get started here theres a few things we have to get clear about
all right mickey
lets discuss it when im unbound
camera holds on mickey standing still as the two deputies remove the chains
camera is inside a holding cell fixed on the cell door
the cell door is unlocked then opened
the two deputies bring mallory inside
scagnetti wanders in trailing behind
bingham pumps his shotgun slide and places the barrel next to mallorys head
washington unlocks the cuffs around mallorys wrists
scagnetti leans up against the wall smoking his cigarette
turn around and face the wall
bingham and washington move to the door
wait outside for a second fellas
were not supposed dont worry about it
bingham and washington move outside
scagnetti takes out his gun and tosses it to washington
before they can protest scagnetti closes the door
mallory stands in the middle of the cell motionless her back to him
scagnetti walks up behind her
mallory doesnt move
want a smoke
mallorys steel eyes glare at scagnetti
cmon i already lit one for you
i know you smoke
mallory doesnt respond
scagnetti takes the cigarette from his mouth and puts it between mallorys lips
hold on c
i was reading the file on you
you know what it said during your trial whenever they put you on the stand no matter what they asked your answer was always the same
i love mickey
it also says that when they gave you a polygraph i love mickey was the only thing you said that registered as the truth
scagnetti appears at the side of frame next to mallory
who are you supposed to be
is that it
is mickey your charles manson
is mickey jesus
is that the attraction
or does he just got a big dick
scagnetti changes to mallorys other ear
thats it isnt it
mickeys got a big donkey dick
scagnetti presses closer
can you remember the last time you fucked
what i want you to do is close your eyes and remember
remember the last time ol mickey gave you the high hard one
are ya thinkin about it
dont ever forget it cause it aint never gonna happen again
cause when they get through with all that electroshock shit they got lined up for you two micks dick aint gonna be worth shit
mallory spits the lit cigarette unto scagnettis face
scagnetti spins her around and slaps her
youre gonna sit here for a couple hours while i finish up the arrangements
the reason they picked me to be your chaperone is they know i wont hesitate to put a bullet in you
scagnetti has mallory clutched tightly by her shoulders
so during our journey if any wild hairs spring up on your ass youd better slap a muzzle on em
fuck with me bitch even a little bit youre gonna get accidentally shot
mallory looks at him for a moment then gives his a massive head butt
as we hear the cracking of his nose scagnetti lets out a horrible scream
bingham and washington fumble with the keys to open the cell door
bingham and washington burst through the door to find scagnetti face down on the ground
mallorys standing her foot pressed against the middle of scagnettis back pulling his arms behind him trying to break his back
his body is bending like a branch and hes screaming
the two deputies proceed to beat the shit out of her with their shotguns
scagnetti rolls around in the b
holding his bloody nose screaming
she broke my fucking nose
that bitch broke my nose
washington comes over to him and helps him up
blood down his face she broke my nose
ill fix it
he grabs scagnettis nose then snaps it back into place
scagnetti lets out another horrible scream and hops up and down from the pain
when the rush of pain passes scagnetti brings his hands down from his face looking over at mallory
bingham has mallory in the corner of the cell with the shotgun barrel placed in her mouth
cu on scagnetti
hes a hand grenade with the pin pulled
hold her boys
scagnetti walks to the corner where mallory is
the shotgun barrels out of her mouth
bingham and washington stand on either side of her holding her in place
scagnetti grabs a can of mace from washingtons belt and brings it up to mallorys face
mallory and scagnetti trade looks
scagnetti gives her an intense blast of mace right in the face eyes and all over her body
mallory crumples to the floor screaming in agony
two shot of bingham and washington looking down at mallory on the ground
we can hear scagnetti still spraying her
they cant look at this anymore
mallory wiggles on the floor as scagnetti continues spraying her all over her body
cu of scagnettis bloody face smiling
we hear the sound of the can of mace running empty
it spurts to a stop
scagnetti rises up to the two deputies
he hands the empty can back to washington
i want this filled before we leave
the three men walk out of the holding cell closing and locking the door behind them
we can still hear mallorys screams of excruciating pain
mickeys sitting in a chair eating a donut
rogers attaching a microphone to his shirt
unruly julies applying make up to mickeys face
to unruly julie how come you never talk
she was born without a tongue
repulsed oh my god
to unruly julie sorry
unruly julie shrugs her shoulders like what are you gonna do and continues applying make up
wayne and wurlitzer talk

back to mickey alone in frame sitting in a chair and eating a donut
he takes a big bite
mouthful of donut what
mickey swallows the bite of donut pauses then recites a poem
talking in rhyme i stand amid the roar of a surf tormented shore as i hold within my hand grains of the golden sand how few
yet how they creep through my fingers to the deep while i weep while i weep
can i not save one from the pitiless wave
is all that we see or seem but a dream within a dream
mickey bites into the donut
mouthful of donut how was that
roger joins him in frame and adjusts the mike

wayne grabs a chair and sets it in front of mickey

wayne smiles and exits frame
lets start to settle down here
mm black white scene is now shot through scotts camera which holds a ecu of mickeys eye
camera focuses then pulls out to include his whole face

mickey looks to wayne off screen and nods
camera slate reading knox interview roll is thrust into view and clapped
the camera zooms out to include wayne in the so mickey tell us what you do for fun

camera zooms in on mickeys face
mickey looks at wayne takes a slow drag off his cigarette
where the purity comes into play the image on the screen starts to flutter and then jams
white leader fills the screen
im sorry wayne
mickey hold onto that thought
were back to color mm
white leader fades to reveal the wall of the holding cell
camera pans onto mallory on the floor splashing water on her face from the holding cell toilet
the pain has started to subside
all wet she lies down on the ground and sings singing love is a hurtin thang and it leaves a fiery sting
okay were up again

scagnetti walks down the hallway leading to the supply room
his face is a patchwork of medical tape to set his broken nose
bloody cotton protrudes from each nostril
scagnetti walks into the supply room
mickey is explaining to wayne why hes killed all those people
scagnetti cant believe what hes seeing
the entire room is in rapture
one night i was asleep and a noise wakes me up

wurlitzer sees scagnettis bandaged face

i walked into the place and had never seen so many guns in all my life

the deputy holds the receiver of the wall phone in his hand

wurlitzer rushes to the phone grabs the receiver

camera pans away from wurlitzer to the extremely curious eavesdroppers
camera glides by all of them scagnetti wayne scott roger unruly julie and finally ends up on mickey

a large coke and two orders of fries
when she finishes writing down mickeys order julie walks off silently
camera follows julie out the door and into
camera dollies with julie as she walks down the corridor
as deputies with shotguns and riot gear speed down the hall the camera passes julie and speeds down the corridor following the deputies into blackness
camera pans from blackness to wide angle of a dark jail wall masques with shadows of prison bars
the surreal echoing sounds of a riot swell until
a shadow of a prison guard stumbles into frame followed by a mob of other shadows carrying nightsticks and bars
the mob catches the prison guard and beat him mercilessly before moving on
camera tilts down to a cu of a thin stream of blood crawling across the floor
shot through scotts camera focusing on mickey whos standing in a medium shot
you guys wanna hear a joke i heard
now im no comedian but its pretty funny
its a little johnny joke
now in the joke little johnny cant talk
and little johnnys teenage sister asks her mother if she can go out on a date
as mickey tells this joke he moves around the room
scotts camera follows

a sheet of paper flashes through frame
heres the list of the rioters

wurlitzer reads the list to himself as he paces
reading the names alvarado issacs julian martinez newendyke olvera pool ramos schmidt spivey walsh westerguard
wurlitzer drops into a chair exhausted
he rubs his face with his hands
wurlitzer looks up then looks back down

wurlitzer holds a frozen look as if a fuse has blown and his mind has shut down
if he were to open his mouth now nothing would come out
he just sits
the hostages have been cut free from each other and sit against the wall
roger cradles the betacam in his lap rocking slowly as if in a trance while scagnetti feebly splints his broken fingers with the tape that hangs from his wrists
wayne is standing alert and ready for action
as for the two deputies hostage deputy sits in anger tight lipped and stoic
the other deputy duncan homolka is panicked and jumpy one may never see a more nervous man
mickey and mallory stand over them with their weapons drawn
okay were going out that door and were gonna march down the hall and right out of the building
to wayne donut said something about a news van

duncan begins to cry

roger snaps up and hoists the camera to his shoulder
shot through rogers camera image focuses on mallory as she points to scagnetti sitting on the floor
scagnetti gulps then rises knowing that he has fucked with the wrong woman
mallory walks up to him with pistol in hand
you probably thought it was pretty funny didnt ya
she raises scagnettis pistol aiming it at its former owner
scagnetti flinches and squirms
can you remember the last time you fucked with me
close your eyes and remember
are ya thinking about it
mallory fires three shots into scagnettis chest
rogers camera jumps then follows the body to the floor
roger holds on scagnetti slumped on the floor
were sending out a hostage
dont touch him
off screen the door is kicked open
rogers camera whips around to witness mickey and mallory jumping into the corridor blasting with their guns while using the hostages for shields
rogers camera moves out of the cell and
there are even more deputy sheriffs in the corridor
cross fire whistles by as roger dodges to catch up with the caravan
the footage is very similar to vietnam footage
its shaky real harsh and it captures the pandemonium of battle
the soundtrack is a mixture of yelling crying laughing and gunfire
hostage deputy is shot and discarded by mickey
the wild caravan runs down the hallway firing behind them
mickeys hit but keeps on running and firing
mallory sees this and screams
rogers camera runs along with them
man oh man
this is better than vietnam
more deputies appear at the end of the hallway
mickey and mallory get back to back with each other using duncan as a shield in front of them and wayne behind them
mickey fires from the front mallory fires from the rear
please dont kill me
dont kill me
camera whip pans to catch a deputy hopping around the corner
the screen flashes white with a blast
rogers hit and the camera goes haywire reeling out of control the thunking to the ground
roger screams o
camera lies on the floor video still transmitting
roger rolls into frame screaming
get the camera
get the fucking camera
back to color mm
as mickey fires cover for her mallory swipes the camera from rogers side
the knoxs start running again still holding wayne and last hostage
deputies are lying on the ground wounded and screaming or dead and silent
to mallory this way
the caravan bursts into the stairwell
mickey turns to duncan the remaining hostage deputy
to duncan where does this lead
duncan is hyper ventilating
mickey pushes him against to wall
th the ground floor
is that the front door
duncan nods frantically
mickey grabs duncan and the caravan starts running down the stairs
they go down a few flights
as they run down one last flight they find wurlitzer and a team of deputies waiting for them on the ground floor
the deputies raise their guns
mallory grabs hold of wayne and gets behind him with one hand pressing the barrel of her gun against his temple and her other are wrapped around his neck holding
him close to her
back off or ill blast him
back off or ill blast him
back off or ill blast him
none of the deputies lower their guns but they appear less likely to start shooting
i beg you dont shoot
please please please
wayne continues begging
wurlitzer steps forward
now mickey mallory just let me say shut up
dont talk i dont wanna hear it
you have to know i said shut up
mallory quickly lowers her gun from waynes head and shoots him in the thigh
she whips the gun back up to his head
waynes screaming in pain
the deputies jump back
and i mean shut up
theres a bit of a silent standoff
tears are streaming down duncans face as the caravan slowly retreats back up the stairs to the next flight
the deputies hold their present position
the caravan goes up one flight then stops
mickey and mallory let their two hostages sit down
duncan is out and out hysterical urine stains the front of his uniform
mallory leans up against the wall holding her side with her hand
blood trickles out between the fingers
we see now shes been shot
over duncans impassioned clamour they can hear wurlitzer yelling from below
theres no other way out
mickey sits down utterly exhausted
mallory sits down next to
she winces in pain
he puts his arm around her
look lover boy were not getting outta here
so i say the hell with going back to our cells
lets do a butch cassidy and the sundance kid
run down these stairs shootin go out in a hail of bullets but take as many of those motherfuckers with us as possible
suddenly mickeys exhaustion lifts
he has a plan
well do that when all else fails
we still got a few tricks up our sleeves
mickey confronts the two hostages
he points at duncan
oh i dont wanna die
are you married
do you have kids
duncan nods pathetically
people were goin all the way to the front door
now the only way were gonna get there is if they dont want to kill you two more than they want to kill us
shots of deputies with guns in their hands just itching to kill mickey and mallory
we hear mickeys voice over this shot
right now i find that highly unlikely
so lets help em out shall we
mickey is squatting in front of wayne
now say i tell those guys down there if they shoot or make a move im killin wayne gayle
and they shoot or make a move anyway
now say by some freak accident you didnt die you live though it
what would you do
mickey pulls the roll of gaffers tape from his shirt and starts tearing strips of tape and sticking them to the wall
what would i do
me and my network would sue the entire los angeles county sheriffs department for flagrantly disregarding my safety
id go straight to my buddy the mayor and make sure everyone of those son of a bitches down there ends up on the unemployment line
in fact id sue every man down there personally
i would make it my lifes ambition to bring the la county jail to its knees
i would do expose after expose on the brutality and the conditions and the inhumanity that exists here
mickey tosses the tape roll to mallory and gestures to duncan
mallory winks at mickey
mickey smiles and begins wrapping tape around the barrel of his shotgun
thats what i thought
you tell them that
when we go down those stairs i want you to scream what you just told me
my name is wayne gayle
i am the star of american maniacs watched every week by how many people
on average forty million
every week by forty million people
i am a respected journalist
have you won any awards
are you kidding
the golden globe the edward r
respected journalist on your knees
wayne kneels in front of mickey
while mickey speaks he props his shotgun under waynes chin and wraps the tape from the barrel around his neck
continues winner of the golden globe and the edward r
murrow award among others
tell em the name of your personal lawyer his firm his address and phone number
tell em about the mayor and the unemployment lines
you getting the idea
mickey stands with wayne as he tapes his trigger hand to the stock of the shotgun
all the way out the front door and into your van
and if you stop screaming i swear to god ill blow your head off
mickey grabs the camera and lifts it to his shoulder before shouting to duncan
whats your name
duncan cant answer mallory has gagged him with his tape
mallory grabs duncan by the collar and lifts him off the floor before reading his name badge
wurlitzer and the deputies are deciding their next move when they hear start
wayne and duncan come into view with the knoxs behind them
the deputies quickly raise their guns but soon realize if they take out either mickey of mallory that wayne or duncan would die
mallorys right hand is taped to the trigger and stock of the shotgun thats wrapped firmly to duncans neck
the pistol in her left hand is trained on wurlitzer
mickeys left hand masters the shotgun leash on wayne while he monitors the deputies with the camera on his right shoulder
note the following scene will intercut between video footage and color mm
wayne starts belting out his speech as mickey focus the camera on wurlitzer
duncan simply cries and begs for his life to be spared
yelling my name is wayne gayle
i am the star of american maniacs watched by forty million people every week
i am a respected journalist winners of the golden globe the edward r
murrows award among others
if anybody puts me in danger my network will sue the los angeles county sheriffs department
my estate will sue every officer personally who fires
the networks law firm is rowlands davis and sinclair
mickey knew what he was doing
this has an effect on the deputies
yelling make a path
the wall of deputies starts moving backward
the knoxs and their hostages start moving forward with wayne yelling all the way
the deputies keep their guns trained on the caravan but they keep giving ground until they reach the doors of the front lobby and they begin to part like the
wurlitzer stands his ground
how far do you think your gonna get
right out the front door
thatll never happen
it is happening
the caravan marches forth
wayne and duncan keep shouting their speeches
nobody dares to move on them but the deputies keep their weapons ready
wayne stops his speech to take a breath
wayne starts up again
the deputies are completely frustrated
mickey and wurlitzer are nose to nose
to mickey i will personally hunt you down blow the head off your fucking whore wife and plant your sick ass in the ground all by myself
calmly another day perhaps but not today
mickey leaves frame
the doors swing wide in slow motion as the caravan of mickey mallory wayne and duncan take their first step into the open air
a crescent of deputies frame the group in the b
while wurlitzer stands defeated just behind mickey
freeze frame on wide angle
image dissolves to black white before burning into white the white leader is disrupted by a fogged image in black white
the image settles into a ecu of wayne
hes being filmed by a mm camera that he is presently balancing on a fence post
this entire scene is played out cinema verite
the sound is not in sync as wayne steps back into a med shot
he looks directly into the camera
this is wayne gayle
im wounded and my crew roger and scott are dead
this may be out of sync cause we are shooting with a wild camera and a standard recorder we found in the van
mickey knoxs plan worked
we walked out the front door into my news van and made our getaway
when we were followed by patrol cars mallory knox killed deputy sheriff duncan homolka and tossed his body out of the back
mickey told authorities over my police band that i would surely be next if they didnt give up the pursuit
they took mickey at his word and called off the pursuit
why helicopters werent employed i dont know
my only thought is it all happened too fast for arrangements to be made
weve just pulled off to the side of the road to do this interview
tensions run high mickey screams o
we aint got all fuckin day
without any further ado mickey and mallory
wayne steps forward and picks up the camera and while conducting his interview the camera remains hand held
camera focuses on mallory sitting on a stump while mickey paces in and out of frame in the b
mallory what did you think of mickeys plan
did you think it would work
it wasnt till we got on the ground floor that i totally realized they werent gonna shoot unless we shot first
when we got out of the stairwell i remember thinking oh my god
this might work
but mickey knew it would work all along
there wasnt any doubt in his mind
its not like there was and he just didnt show it
he knew it would work
what did you think then
i wondered how long it would be before wed get to be alone together
and i wondered if i could wait that long
did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room
havent you been listening to a fuckin word i said
oh im sorry
can i say fuckin
i cant can i
try to keep it to a minimum
we had nothing to do with that riot
that riot was just whatchmacallit mickey can be heard faintly in the b
what he said
we didnt know jack shit about and riot
it just happened
it was kismet
we didnt even know those people
how are we supposed to organize a riot when weve been in fuckin isolation for the past year
just bleep out the fucks and jack shits
laughs i mean its not like we care
if they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing let em
it wont exactly keep us up at night
but you said you wanted the truth and the truth is we were just lucky
mickeys snapping his fingers in the b
cmon cmon lets hurry this up
so what now
well now me and mickey are gonna take it easy
just enjoy each others company stop and smell the roses notice the color purple stuff like that
how do you intend to disappear
youre probably the most famous couple in america
well back in slave times they had a thing called the underground railroad
and we got a whole fan club out there just waiting to be conductors
to the camera so you kids out there keep the faith
cause mickey and mallory will be comin to your town real soon
okay thats enough
end of interview
we gotta move
mickey approaches wayne
camera goes a little haywire as wayne lowers it from his eye
okay just let me swing around and film myself asking the questions
and then ill do my little wrap up
mickey takes the camera from wayne and while he speaks he balances it on a fence post
oh were gonna do a little wrap up all right
but it wont be you starin in the camera looking dumb and acting stupid
instead youre gonna be starin down the barrels of our shotguns and were gonna be pullin the triggers
wayne forces a chuckle
mickey steps away from the camera and into a three shot
the news van is parked in the b
thats a joke right
mickey pumps the slide of his shotgun
mallory grabs her shotgun from off the ground
just wait one fucking minute
i said id give you a interview
now unless im mistaken we just did a interview
to mallory we did an interview didnt we
looked like an interview to me
i said wed give you an interview
i never said we wouldnt kill you
i dont know but i kinda felt during this
this whole escape that a kind of bond wayne is shaking
continues developed between the three of us
were kindda in this together dont ya think
dont touch those triggers
i think ive already proven that a live wayne gayle is much more better that a dead
i was your passport out of jail not duncan homolka
ill be your passport outta just save your breath wayne
we hate you
if anybody in the fuckin world deserves to die its you
wayne is grasping for anything
you cant kill me
mickey and mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale
points to camera your camera
mickey turns to mallory
john wayne voice lets make a little music colorada
the two interview subjects start pumping rounds into wayne whos body dances like a puppet before collapsing to the ground
mickey and mallory kiss each other passionately then climbing into the news van they drive away
waynes body lay peacefully in frame until the camera eventually runs out of film
a noja production
