written by joel coen ethan coen high in the air so high we an see the curvature of the earth
the eastern seaboard stretches away flecked with clouds
as we dissolve in closer the picture bleaches of color
we are looking down at the city of washington d
dissolve closer still a black and white aerial photograph of a neighborhood in suburban d
dominated by a sprawling building
computer type quickly bleeps on c
headquarters langley virginia we track at floor level following the well shined shoes of someone walking down the well polished hallway
we hear a door opening and a silver haired man rises behind his desk
a nameplate on the desk identifies him as palmer debakey smith
osbourne cox entering is a middle aged man in a striped shirt and bow tie
you know peck and olson
the two men sitting on chairs facing the desk nod at osbourne who is surprised to see them
peck yes hiya

palmer nods at olson

osbourne gets to his feet agitated
this is a crucifixion
this is political
dont tell me its not
he storms out the door
i have a drinking problem
the door slams
palmer smith looks at olson
olson arches an eyebrow
bow tie loosened he stands at a kitchen counter
his shoulders twist as he does something below frame we hear the crackle of ice cubes wrenching loose from a tray
behind him we see the apartment door opening
katie an attractive middle aged woman enters taking her key out of the door but stops surprised to see osbourne
osbourne continues making himself a drink
hang on to your hat honey

i did you pick up the cheeses

wider shows the cocktail party meagerly attended but in full swing
besides osbourne and katie there is harry pfarrer who has just inquired about the cheese bearded forties rugged his wife sandy and a shiny faced young couple doug and tina
osbourne holds a cocktail tumbler
because i have lactose reflux
but i can youre lactose intolerant

theyre two different things
harry looks at him coldly
i know what they are
then you misspoke yourself
so i thank you for correcting me

he eats a piece cupping one hand under his mouth
i was just explaining to your husband here i have a condition katie tries to separate the two men by including doug magruder
harry works with the marshalls service

he looks down at the floor
harry is looking around the kitchen taking in the fixtures
absently about us he knows about us
dont be an ass he doesnt know a thing
harry is staring down at the linoleum again
what is that forbo
a car drives by
harry driving his wife next to him
a long beat
finally what a horses ass
i dont know why we see them
well shes all right
she is a cold stuck up bitch
harry opens his mouth to reply considers doesnt
she is staring in front of a mirror face covered in cold cream one hand arrested on the way up to daub on more
osbourne is buttoning a pajama top
well thank you for letting me know
i tried to tell you this afternoon
and then what the aphasia kicked in
our guests came
for fucks sake ozzie
im just i dont know
i got so tired
tired of swimming against the current
independent thought is not only not valued there they resist it they fight it the bureaucracy is positively did you get a pension or severance or something or i didnt
retire you know i i quit
i dont want their benefits
but i suppose my benefits are all right i suppose you can live with those is that the idea
its not like thats the only way to make money
whatre you gonna do
ill do some consulting
yes to help while i ive always wanted to write
ive been thinking about it
a book a sort of sort of memoir
katie stares at him in the mirror
she bursts into laughter
a small yacht
osbourne stands at the wheel a light wind in his face as the boat sails under motor power
after a beat he moves to the front of the boat
an old man sits on a bench on the prow facing out into the wind
he has snowy hair and a stern yankee face
he wears a tweed cap
he doesnt much react to osbournes approach
you okay there dad
the old man remains silent staring
osbourne sits next to him and idly tucks in the plaid blanket resting over the mans knees
dad i left my job at the agency
the old man stares out into the wind
dad government service is not what it was when you were in state
things are different now
i dont know maybe its
the cold war ending now it seems like its all bureaucracy and no mission
the old man stares out into the wind
im writing a memoir
i think its going to be pretty explosive
but i dont think youll disapprove
i dont think youll disapprove
katie has had trouble accepting it
sometimes theres a higher patriotism dad
yes change is hard
its hard on katie
but well be okay
well be okay
life is change
this is good
we were all blocked up katie and me
this is this is a blessing in disguise
ill go into training you know
lay off the sauce
like you did
you managed to do it
and then i can concentrate on you know
and thisll all have been for the best
dont you think dad
the old man stares out into the wind
he taps the old man on the knee and rises
i guess we should head back
the sailboat docked at the end of a marina
osbourne is pushing the old man in a wheel chair down the pier away from the boat
weve seen this
white hair bushy eyebrows a florid face
he is in a law book lined conference room
he wears an expensive suit suspenders a white shirt with blue collar and cuffs
he is bogus terikhian
i know this kind of man
weve seen this
wider on the conference room shows that katie cox sits at the table along with terikhian another lawyer and an assistant
cox you cant let this man take advantage of you
and he will
this is my fear
hes trying he says hes trying to pull himself together but
look sure i im obliged to tell you you should try to salvage things
and you should
people turn themselves around
not unheard of
you you havent broached the possibility of divorce yet
well thats good
because first you should get all his financials
before hes forewarned
because heres a man heres a man practiced in deceit this is almost you could say its his job practiced at hiding things and there is no reason it is
not improper there is no reason for you not to get a picture of the household finances
paper files computer files whatever this is your prerogative
you can be a spy too madam
do this before you put him on alert
before the turtle can draw in his head and his uh
he waggles his hands groping for the word
and hopefully everything will work out
he will reform
if not forewarned is forearmed
osbourne is splayed on an easy chair wearing a bathrobe over pyjamas
he stares at the ceiling motionless arms out flung like marat in his bathtub
a long still beat
a clock ticks
abruptly osbourne raises one hand to speak into a microcassette recorder
we were young and committed and there was nothing we couldnt do
we thought of the agency less as
the thought such as it was peters out
osbourne rises and wanders around the room glassy eyed
he suddenly raises the microcassette again
the principles of george kennan a personal hero of mine were what animated us
in fact they were what had originally inspired me to enter government service
like the state departments china hands of yore or in a different forum in a different venue in a different medium in um
murrows boys the fabled in a different he suddenly stops head cocked listening
faintly a ringing phone
at the cut osbourne is thundering down a steep carpeted stairway
he inclines his head to clear the ceiling that juts over the bottom half of the stairwell
the phone is louder here
a semi finished basement with cheap paneling and a low dropped ceiling of water stained johnson armstrong tile
the ringing phone is on a cheap government surplus desk
the answering machine with osbournes voice picks up
you have reached the cox group
osbourne robe flapping shuffles hurriedly in his slippered feet toward the phone
we cant answer your call right now
please leave a heavy breathing hello
he eases into the chair having swiped up the phone
a listening beat
no call her number
no shes not but leave it on her machine
we are looking over osbournes shoulder he is still in his robe as he sits hunched on an ottoman looking at a daytime game show
a few beats of the show
roaring laughter from the studio audience
mild chuckle from osbourne in the foreground
osbourne paces with the microcassette recorder
he raises it with a thought draws a breath and then stops and looks off
the ticking grandfather clock ornate hands on an ornate clock face two or three minutes to five
osbourne stares for a long beat
shoulders twisting as we hear ice clattering out of a tray
he pours coke sizzling onto the ice
he pauses for a long beat
he takes a bottle of rum out of a cabinet
he pours some into a hatch marked shot glass
he looks at it
the amber liquid tops the hatch mark
he conscientiously pours the overage back murmuring single
he dumps the shot into the coke
as before the boat docked at the end of the marina pier is seen in long shot through the windshield of a car
closer on the boat
as water laps against pilings and the boat gently bobs and creaks we hear muffled the sounds of a couple having sex
when it builds to climax we cut minutes later
we hold on a door for a quiet beat then we hear the gurgle of water and then the door opens
harry pfarrer emerges from the small bathroom buckling his belt
in the bedroom which he emerges into katie cox is just finishing dressing
harry looks at his watch
i should try to get a run in
katie is letting herself in
katie enters and sees a note on the counter paperweighted by a plate of used lime wedges
honey at fenningers
reunion committee dinner
see you later
long lens hand held point of view seeming harry pfarrer is jogging in his treasury sweats
closer on him
he spins jogs backwards looking
his point of view nothing unusual traffic on the bridge no pedestrians particularly close
harry mildly puzzled slows and stops
he turns again
point of view up the bridge empty
harry starts jogging again
we are tracking toward the desk in the corner at which katie sits
she cracks open a cd case and loads the cd into osbournes computer
a suspense drone builds as we track in
katie starts typing then suddenly stops
she holds still listening for noises in the house
she resumes typing
we hear male voices beginning to swell in song
the voices continue after the suspense drone snaps off at the cut to a musty steakhouse
on the walls are hunting scene prints and steel engravings of english country houses
a placard resting on a chair outside the georgian room from inside the room male voices tune every heart and every voice
a dozen middle aged men around a long table each holding high a glass
bid every care withdraw
let all with one accord rejoice
the men are sweaty tie loosened dinner stuffed and boozy
in praise of old nassau
close on osbourne as a rotund middle aged classmate fills his glass to brimming
the two sway unsteadily with the music
in praise of old nassau my boys hoo rah hoo rah hoorah
all swing their glasses side to side in rhythm her sons
glasses are thrust high with a ringing finish in praise of old nassau
someone with a marker is drawing on the flesh to illustrate we take all the chicken fat off your buttocks here
and the upper arms
and a little off your tummy
the camera is arcing around a standing naked middle aged woman to reveal the doctor sitting on a stool in the examining room facing her
he reaches forward again with the marker
and we do breast augmentation with a tiny incision here
and what about the thigh area
well we can do liposuction there as well but that area will respond to exercise
buttocks and upper arms begin to store more fat when you get up around forty the body just tells it to go there but the thighs will respond to toning
i know i can work out on my arms til the cows come home but
and of course there are also genetic factors
the litzkes are big
uh huh well everythings my mom had an ass that could pull a bus
well thats a predispo fathers side too although dad tends to carry his weight in front of him
in the gut area
derriere not so much
the continuing track around is also booming up to reveal the face of the patient linda litzke
and what about the face you know the window to the soul
very well put
well your eyes are one of your best features
but we can do something about the incipient crows feet
baby crows feet
little chicklings feet
i mean chicks
chickie chickie chickie
ha ha yes again well put
you have a way with words
we cut here
and we pull the skin tight like stretching the skin over a drum
not too tight though
we dont want that worked on look
you need sufficient slack for the face to remain expressive
yeah i dont wanna look like boris karloff
heh heh so you dont want a sex change
no im all woman
doctor and patient now dressed sit on either side of a desk
so linda what were talking about here is four different procedures
ticks them off the liposuction
the facial tuck which i would strongly recommend over the chemical peel
yeah i dont want to get anything burned off
and why should you
with that lovely skin
and lastly the breast augmentation
now we can also do something about the vaccine scar i dont know if you wear sleeveless dresses much not with these ham hocks
yes well once theyre nice and svelte post op you well i dont know
is the vaccine thing can you counsel me on this
i dont know is it unsightly
i see it a lot a bunch of people have it
some women dont mind it at all
linda litzke in a hardbodies polo shirt with linda stitched on the breast leans out of her semi enclosed office on the gym floor
chad feldheimer trainer fortyish and well muscled has a gym patron up on a table and is helping him stretch a leg back
im sorry was that too much

linda slaps his arm

linda is showing someone around the floor
this is the cardio area
a lot of machines here so that believe me theres never a wait
what youre seeing now this is our busiest time and theres still a couple of open treadmills i see three stairmasters i call it the butt blaster couple of lifecycles
chad is working with a medicine ball and a heavy young woman

chad is one of our trainers

linda is leaning forward at her desk phone wedged between ear and shoulder one hand up at her forehead
after a long still beat yes
another still beat
yes hi this is linda litzke should i give you my account number

i was informed that i needed pre approval for these surgeries and then
yes it was denied

her jaw sets
she controls her fury
quieter yes i do understand
could i speak to your supervisor please
we are on a long lens point of view from several cubicles over of linda now slumped at her desk head in her arms
we faintly hear her sobbing
reverse shows ted treffon middle aged balding the soulful manager of hardbodies
he looks at linda puzzled and a little alarmed
he tenses as if to rise but doesnt and hovers uncomfortably unsure of whether to intrude
linda walks down the promenade dressed in a smart pant suit
her moving pov passes over a couple in conversation an old woman feeding the birds a man in a business suit reading a newspaper
she passes the man and turns around
he has looked up from the paper and is staring at her
he wears aviator shaped glasses with clear plastic rims
he may have hair plugs
are you uh
a poster advertises totally stoked
with dermot mulroney and claire danes
on the screen dermot mulroney dressed in a tuxedo cranes his head to look steeply up and off
linda sits next to alan in the half empty theatre nervously watching the screen
first you tell me that you cant commit then you would you get down linda laughs raucously then catches herself and looks at alan
the couple sit across from each other at a small table
they pick at their food
the couple are making love in the dark room on a frilly comforter
alan still wearing his glasses wheezes asthmatically
alan is snoring
after a long beat linda gets up and puts on a robe
she bends down near the bed and picks something up out of alans trousers
she sits into a chair near the window in the dark room and opens alans wallet
a discover card drivers license a condom
a photograph of alan holding a large bluefish
she unfolds a piece of notepaper
written in a feminine hand in pencil please pick up plunge honey nut cheerios
oh for petes sake
she catches herself looks around
the snoring off continues
she looks out the window
the lights of the freeway twinkle
we are in the bedroom
the boat rides gently at anchor
harry has an arm around katie in bed
both stare at a point in space
after a beat that is silent except for the faint sloshing of water against hull and then you know you grow up
i guess thats whats happened with me
we married when i was what in my mid twenties
we were kids
you think its forever
then you know youre older you begin to feel your mortality you start to think well theres no more time for dishonesty
you go im not that person
the choices you made you cant just through inertia im thinking of divorcing ozzie
harry doesnt react a careful studied non reaction
after more sloshing im just thinking whoa
i mean frankly im thinking whoa
i i i guess thats what i should be thinking about too
thats what you were just saying
and you should be getting rid of that bozo
no question about that
so if i were divorced well yes if you were uh you know yes

i thought i was loud and clear
not just fun and games
the sloshing of waves
harry pfarrer pulls a length of metal tubing from a shelf
he sights down it examines the gauge hefts it
he slides it back in and pulls a length wider gauge from the shelf below
long lens hand held point of view seeming harry is pushing a red shopping cart through the parking lot
standing in the cart are lengths of metal tubing that he steadies with one hand as he pushes
linda has a hand cupped to her forehead and the phone pressed to one ear
after a short beat she hits a button on the phone console and cradles the handset
from the speaker we hear important to us
please stay on the line for the next available agent
linda listens for a moment then abruptly lifts the handset and slams it back down
ted treffon the soulful manager of hardbodies stands with one hand on the back of his chair which chad occupies and one hand on the desktop looking over chads shoulder
at a computer screen that chad is scrolling down
standing behind both men is a short mexican indian man also in a hardbodies uniform
ted can i talk to you about our mickey mouse health plan
ted continues to stare at the computer screen in mounting alarm
he responds absently to linda uh huh

a dark blue ford taurus three or four car lengths back on a quiet chevy chase street
harry pfarrer glances at the rear view mirror
behind him we see the steel pipe from home depot laying across the top of the back seat of the station wagon
harry is just getting out of the wagon which is parked in the driveway of the suburban house
harry is struggling through the front door with the length of pipe
we hear his wife call down from upstairs harry

yeah yeah its me
he takes the pipe opens the staircase door to the cellar sets the pipe inside on the upper stair and closes the door behind him
harry is at a workbench welding a length of trimmed pipe to a short piece of hardware clamped in a table vise
his home shop is in a caged off section of the basement
there is also haphazard storage
one shelf holds stacked boxes labeled with magic marker oliver in the oval office yea and nay for oliver point of order oliver
harry loosens the vise and takes out the piece of hardware
he drops it a small bearing mounted clip onto a length of pipe held horizontal in another vise
he experimentally slides the clip along the length of pipe it slides smoothly back and forth nicely balanced
linda litzke and ted treffon the soulful manager of hardbodies are at a table in the yuppie bar monkey daves
to a waitress absolut saketini please

he looks at her appraising
let me show you something
he reaches into his wallet
he pulls out a picture a snapshot of a soulful man in a dark robe and a high caftan standing on a curb in front of a large stone building
linda shrieks omygod is that you
ted nods gravely
fourteen years a greek orthodox priest
congregation in chevy chase
well jeez thats a good job
he looks at the picture for a sad beat then shrugs
he stuffs it back in his wallet
its a long story

its not going to do any good linda
ted have you ever heard of the power of positive thinking
it is night
linda sleeps in a darkened bedroom under the frilly comforter
we hear a distant banging
finally the banging stops and a moment later the telephone rings
linda stirs wakes and reaches for the bedside phone
hurrow she removes an appliance from her mouth
where are you
just a second
we hear a door being buzzed open
at the top of the staircase an apartment door opens and linda appears in a robe
her pov down the steep staircase chad feldheimer is walking up towards the landing dressed in a black lycra bicycle unitard with lime green flames
he holds a bike wheel in one hand and a plastic squirt bottle in the other
he looks up foreshortened
chad enters with his bicycle wheel and squirt bottle
linda shuts the door behind him
chad you know what time it is
so like i couldnt tell you this on your totally unsecure phone but i know who the guy is
he leans his wheel against the wall and sits on a low chair that brings his knees up near his chin
he looks smugly at linda
the guy the secret guy
is he high up
i dont know if hes high up
i mean i know his name not like his rank
what is it
never heard of him
oh like youre so plugged in to the intelligence community
im just saying to the layman well i think like the quality of the intelligence dictates how high up he is
not what we know
and i also got his do you have any water
i gotta hydrate
i have tap water

how did you find out who he is
what do you mean sources

he rises and heads for the kitchen
you know how far this is from my place
how do you know his name
i have this geek friend ernie gallegos
he does computer stuff hooks up peoples computers and programs their vcrsn shit
so he examines the files and he pulls off the digital watermark that tells what computer they were created on
fucking childs play for ernie
chad opens the refrigerator and starts rummaging
i also have his telephone number
that was a little harder
chad straightens up with a bottle of orange juice which he rolls across his forehead
shall we give him a tinkle
because hes gonna wanna know that his shit is secure
you know hes gonna be relieved
he might even be so relieved he gives us a reward i would be very fucking surprised if he did not
like you know the good samaritan tax
which is not even a tax really since its voluntary
chad is looking at a crumpled piece of notepaper and punching numbers into a wall phone
in the background we see linda watching him from the living room couch
we hear the call ring through
the click of the connection being made and chad silently gestures with an upward sweep of his hand for linda to pick up her extension
he has the phone pressed groggily to his ear
yes uh who is this

we are dutch on her as she leans down a staircase one hand on its rail calling to be heard over the buzz of a bandsaw honey
the bandsaw whines higher cutting through steel
the whine hums down
my cab is here im off
her point of view down the stairs oddly cropped by the angles of dropped ceiling and walls we see harrys lower body as he throws a drape over his project
he emerges from the shop cage and closes its mesh door and padlocks it
what is that thing
he comes up the stairs pushing goggles onto his forehead
youre gonna knock em dead
at the top of the stairs he kisses her
how many cities
seattle san francisco los angeles chicago
he picks up her bag and they go out
why do they always have you do seattle

ill be sad
but ill be okay
not too sad
just the right amount
he kisses her
i am crazy about you baby
he slams the car door after her
as the car pulls out his look travels with it and then lingers up the street caught on a ford taurus parked dark
harry hesitates then starts walking up the street towards the parked car
when he has taken several steps the ignition is turned in the car
a shape briefly visible in the drivers seat is lost when the headlights flash on
the car pulls out from the curb into a u turn and drives away
harry watches the tail lights recede
twisting a gold cufflink like a worry bead
wider shows the attorney bogus terikhian at a conference table in a book lined room
tony bennett toni morrison and zoe caldwell
it was marvelous

connie could you bring in your copy of the cox financials
the secretary rummages through a gym bag that has the hardbodies logo
there are gym clothes among the odds and ends
she picks up her handset

i think you understand what im saying
itll piss ozzie off
terikhian i have given my husband second chances galore
there are limits to my charity
but since we are at the point of no return i always urge my clients at this juncture to give it one more day of reflection
linda walks down the promenade dressed in a smart pant suit
her moving pov passes over people relaxing in the park a mother with a stroller kids running with a ball
her look settles on the bench that formerly held her first date now occupied by a man spitting sunflower seeds
the point of view arcs past him as linda gives him the once over
she doubles back
harry and linda eat with appetite as they talk
yeah i did the whole bodyguard thing for years
my guy was in state the secretary in fact so of course i traveled a lot
harry talks into his sleeve cuff as if into a radio transmitter ironside is leaving the building
we called him iron ass
not to his face of course

linda cackles again harry smiles
ah he was okay
but personal protection thats a young mans game

in a situation where your man is threatened the training kicks in
reflex those are outrageous
he stabs another dumpling off lindas plate
linda swings the door open leading harry in
harry talks as he looks appraisingly around the apartment
but there was just a hell of a lot of political infighting petty petty shit and then basically the old man stepped on goldbergers throat
he is evaluating the place
he stamps on the floor
wide plank pine
harry is taking off his coat
listen full disclosure here linda
he holds up both hands and waggles the fingers
im not wearing a wedding ring but i am married

linda reacts to his gun in the shoulder holster thats not gonna go off is it
well lets go in the other room and find out

linda looks over chad feldheimer in his trainers polo shirt is knocking on the cubicle window
he gestures urgently for her to come out
linda and chad emerge from the health club through a heavy back door
no you cant go like that
you gotta wear a suit
well you mean go home and change
i was gonna ride my bike
do i have time
harry and katie are at a downtown d
restaurant in the middle of lunch
which to my mind is all the more reason to lower the boom on ozzie
wondering if its the right time
of course its the right time
why wouldnt it be the right time
does it threaten you
no you and me are rock solid
thats why i uh i think we can afford to be big
we can think about ozzie whether maybe we should let him get himself together a little before you hammer him with um is that how you see me hammering him
of course not but werent those your words
yes but i dont hammer
no uh huh of course not
but im saying im no friend of the guy
you know that
i think hes an arrogant little geek
but for christ sakes you and me have all the time in the world and he just lost his job he didnt lose it he quit
most of the people who quit in this town were fired
katie looks at harry reckoning
he returns her look with an open one
i feel sorry for the guy
and hell be easier to deal with when he doesnt feel
as long as were talking about ozzie and not you
of course were talking about ozzie
baby i stand by you whatever you do
i adore you
she nods thinking still gazing at him
her cell phone chirps and she reaches into her purse

she flips open the phone
is there blood in his stool
she looks at her watch rises
its after two
i have to get back to work
harry rises to kiss her
i love you so much
wider shows osbourne cox sitting in a car parked on a downtown street consulting his watch
he looks up irritated and glances around
his look is arrested by the side view mirror
it shows a man approaching on bicycle along the sidewalk wearing a suit and a bike helmet
the man dismounts several paces behind the parked car locks his bike to a fence separating the sidewalk from a small park and takes off his helmet
it is chad
he walks along the sidewalk to the car opens the passenger door and sits in with his bike helmet clamped under one arm
and you i take it are mr

what youre engaged in is blackmail which is a felony
thats for starters
appearances can be deceptive

osbourne has punched him in the nose
chad stares at him stunned
his nose starts bleeding
give it to me fuck
he opens the car door and gets out hand to his nose
he slams the door
as chad goes over to his bike osbourne leans across the front seat and cranks down the passenger window to bellow i know who you are fucker
he pulls out

chad looks surprised
linda is pulling up
her passenger window rolls down
wheres the money

oh for get in
he is thrown back against the seat as linda floors it
recovering hey whatre you linda is coming up fast behind osbournes car in traffic
the crash of impact ramming osbourne
he recoils from the impact
holy fucking you fucking morons
the follow car is speeding up again but it doesnt hit him
it swerves out screeching to pass and linda angrily flips him the finger as she speeds by
thatll give him something to think about
chad is chuckling
suddenly he sobers
we gotta go back
lindas jaw is set
the car is ripping through traffic
i knew this would happen
we gotta go back
its on to plan b
its just a kryptonite lock you can open those fuckers with a bic pen
heavens sakes where we going
a skidding turn sends his weight against the door and the car lurches to a halt
what is this
the hulking embassy building
linda stands before a reception desk
chad is just behind her his shirt front spotted with blood and his head tipped back with one hand pressing a hankie to his nose
his bike helmet is clamped under his other arm
i told mr
krapkin i might be stopping by

linda and chad sit in chad with a moistened hand towel now pressed to his nose
behind the desk sits a sixtyish russian functionary with the beetle browed sphynx like look of the brezhnev era bureaucrat
this is krapotkin
i am assistant cultural attache
the organs of state security are not allowed to function within the borders of your country
the organs of state security
but if i had oh say secrets of a highly um secrets that would interest the organs of state security
she trails off nodding encouragingly at krapotkin
krapotkin looks blankly back
a long beat
she rummages in her handbag and pulls out the diskette
she holds it aloft waggling it for krapotkin
linda sets the diskette on the table and slides it across
this is just a taste
after a beat of looking at the proffered diskette krapotkin leans forward to take it
krapotkin turns the diskette over a couple of times looks sadly up
may i ask the source of this
linda slowly shakes her head eyes locked on krapotkin
no you may not
very high up
im just saying hes high up
a large drop of blood has gathered at the tip of chads nose
it now drops onto his shirt
finally pc or meck

when the door closes behind him the fish

a long beat
linda looks at her watch

chad is slumped back with his head tilted back
linda looks at her watch
the door opens
a man in a suit could you accompany me please
the three people linda chad the man in the suit walking
linda gazes around chad has his head mostly back
vladimir putin glares down from a framed photograph on the wall
chad and linda are sitting before yet another man even blander than the first
can you tell me where this material comes from
linda makes a pantomime of zipping her lip
the man looks at her impassively
name rank and serial number
the russians focus shifts to the man with the bloody nose excuse me
we know our rights
the man stares at him
this is just a taste
the mans look swings back to the woman for another staring beat
at length yellow revision

linda holds up her watch and taps at it date
the man sighs

point of view from a car pulling into hardbodies
ted treffon the soulful manager stands on the sidewalk in front of the gym squinting into the approaching car his arms out to either side palms up what the hell

a line to check in towels piling up
manolo running around like crazy what happened to your nose

he shakes his head
the car is parked in the driveway of the cox townhouse its back crumpled
reverse shows katie looking at it furious her jaw set
katie marches in the door
goddamnit ozzie what have you done to the car
osbourne lightly sheened by sweat is in the easy chair in his robe his microcassette recorder under the hand splayed across his chest
amber fluid puddles a glass on the side table
osbourne snores softly
katies fury mounts
she visibly fights it down
in harry pfarrers house
harry stands before the mirror humming as he meticulously trims his eyebrow hair with a hoffritz scissors
we hear his phone ringing then the answering machine sandy and i arent here to take your call
please leave a message
after a beep can i see you please
harry please call me
im very upset
harry continues to hum trimming his eyebrows
the machine beeps off
harry walks into the living room
he takes some as yet unfolded packing boxes and strews them with studied randomness across the floor
as he does so we hear a cell phone chirp
harry fishes the phone out of his pocket and holds it at arms length squinting at the number
still humming he stuffs the phone back in his pocket
linda meets harry with a kiss
im sorry am i late
no no doesnt start for five minutes
he is escorting to a movie theater entrance
you havent seen this have you
no no i havent
our follow move brings in a light box displaying the one sheet for totally stoked
with dermot mulroney and claire danes
as they tail out of frame i hear its terrific
on the screen dermot mulroney dressed in a tuxedo cranes his head to look steeply up and off
first you tell me that you cant commit then you would you get down along with linda harry laughs raucously tossing popcorn into his mouth
the door swings in and harry and linda enter
harry refers to the boxes littering the floor pardon our dust i uh the ex is in the process of moving out
i told her i wanted to expedite this
we uh you know you try to act like an adult
oh its never easy

well im very open to new experiences
the overhead light is switched on
as harry and linda come down the stairs i gotta tell ya i saw an ad for this in a gentlemans magazine twelve hundred bucks
i take a look at this thing i think jesus you gotta be kidding im a hobbyist this is basically nothing but speed rail i could probably go to home
depot and whip this up myself for like a hundred bucks
he sweeps the drop cloth off his project
it looks like a rowing machine though with a higher seat
its function is obscure
what is it
smug what is it
you siddown feet in the stirrups and
he pushes the seat with his foot
it slides forward then back forward and back rocking
on its forward arc a dildo emerges from the center of the seats pipe track angled toward the seat bottom which is cleft to accommodate its entrance
a long beat as the seat squeaks back and forth the dildo rhythmically bobbing up and down
at length omygod
another couple of cycles
isnt that somethin
hundred bucks all in if you dont count my labor
and the you know cost of the dildo
those things are not cheap
but i lack the uh im not set up to mold hard rubber
both stare at the rocking love seat squeak
sitting in a bar booth staring incredulous
across from him a man of osbournes age
russian embassy yeah
hey the guy was not hard to follow
as you know
why the fuck would they go to the russians
the man responds only with a shrug and a commiserating head shake
why the fuck
osbourne struggles to compose himself
thank you hal
he leans in voice lowered
ozzie i hate to be the paranoid old spook but those two guys seem very interested in you
you havent gone poofy on me have ya oz
there are two men with drinks at a booth
at osbournes look one of them who has been staring looks hastily away
sharply can i help you
the man meets his look again
he smiles rises ambles over
sorry to stare i just couldnt place the
youre princeton arent you
i just didnt remember your
osbourne extends a hand
he smiles as he deposits a large manila envelope in osbournes extended hand
he nods toward his companion watching from the booth
have a good evening
the man walks off his friend hastily knocks back the rest of his drink and rises to follow him
osbourne stares stupidly at the envelope in his hand
the car corners into a driveway and its headlights rake the front of the cox townhouse which is dark
a couple of pieces of luggage and several cardboard boxes are stacked on the stoop most of them protected from the rain by the eave but some not
what the fuck
the car stops
osbourne emerges runs through the rain to the front stoop
rain drums against cardboard
what the fuck
he puts his key in the lock and it doesnt turn
he nudges a cardboard box with his toe
he looks up at the dark house squinting against the rain
linda and chad sit at the counter linda drinking a large protein shake chad idly twirling a straw wrapper around one finger
why did you tell him we could get more stuff
well maybe we can
thats all manolo found
that was everything
whatre we gonna tell manolo to scoop some more secret shit off the locker room floor
i dont like the snideness
nor the negativity
abashed im sorry
im just trying to work this thing
if im going to reinvent myself i need those surgeries
and those surgeries cost money
this is not just fun and games
so lets figure this thing out
chad your berry blast is ready
we know who he is right osbourne cox
so we can find out where he lives right
you should change
into your suit
so you dont look out of place in the neighborhood
there are certain elementary things
well remove the laundry marks and labels
and you should not be carrying id
chad your berry blast is waiting
a car is pulling into the driveway
katie cox emerges from the drivers side
reverse shows chad in his suit watching from a parked car across the street
now harry pfarrer emerges from the passenger side wearing a brown pin striped suit
encumbered by something bulky he follows katie up the walk
it seems to be some kind of pillow or cushion under his arm but very large and wedge shaped
katie is letting herself in harry gives a furtive glance around as chad sinks back in his car seat before entering with the wedge cushion
the door closes
chad relaxes straightens up
he looks idly around
he notices another car parked on the same side of the street further up
someone is just straightening from a slouch to become visible over the drivers headrest
chad looks puzzled
chad is sucking the dregs of his jamba juice up a straw when a noise brings his look around
the door to the townhouse is opening
katie emerges in a change of clothes
harry follows in sweats
they get into her car
it pulls out
chad watches it go up the street
he is about to open his door but pauses seeing the parked car up the street
katies car having passed it now pulls out and follows at a discreet distance
both cars disappear
chad opens his door and gets out
he is crossing to the townhouse when he notices another car parked on the other side of the street
a man sits in the drivers seat smoking
chad proceeds on to the house
there is a barred garden level door tucked under the stoop
chad checks out the caging on the door
he looks up the facade of the house
it pulls over at one end of the potomac bridge that we have seen before
whats the odometer say
about five or approximately five
i mean about f for fucks sake harry its five miles
five point two
okay fine i gotta do at least five
five and a deuce is okay
im surprised you have any energy left
you kiddin pull around the corner well do it again in back
you are very coarse
no back of the car
i didnt mean a rear entry uh ach
im late the car squeals away leaving harry on the shoulder
chad is cornering the house on the driveway side appraising
a low wall separates driveway from back garden
chad gives a quick glance around
chad vaults the wall to land in the garden
the garden steps down to a back door
chad checks out the windows in back then goes to the door
it is locked
it has a large window
we can see chads form outside the door
its pane is tapped once
he spins jogs backward
his point of view a car traveling slowly
harry cuts across a park lawn
chad is nosing around the basement
he notices ozzies office set up
emerging from the park onto another street
he looks around and satisfied that he has lost the tail jogs on
chad is looking at the screen of ozzies computer
he fishes a cd out of his suit pocket feeds it into the computer
jogging entering a residential area
chad is emerging from the basement
he is looking idly around heading toward the front door when a shape materializes in its frosted glass sidelight
there is scraping at the lock
chad quickly mounts the stairs
chad freezes listening
the downstairs door swings open shut
a tread on the stairs chad scurries into the first open door
chad hotfoots into a closet and eases its door most of the way shut
the footsteps mount the stairs
chad peeks out
his pov the bed bedclothes rumpled
in the middle of the bed a wedge cushion
beyond the open bedroom door shows a slice of hallway and stairs
harry arrives at the top of the stairs
he nudges back a drape on the window at the top of the steps
he looks down one way then the other
he lets the drape fall back and seems to relax
harry enters the bedroom
he strips off his shirt and steps out of his pants on his way into the bathroom off the master bedroom
he leaves the door open
chad reaches gingerly for the closet door to close it but stops abruptly as we hear the shower turned off and the curtain whipped back
harry emerges from the shower
he rinses off humming born free and walks into the foreground pulling on shorts and shirt and a pair of dress pants that was draped across a bureau
chad shrinks back into the closet as harry approaches
harry stops just outside the cracked door
through the crack we see only the white of his shirt
abruptly harry turns his back to us and recedes into the room and bends to pick something off the floor
chad leans in ever so slightly to see but draws back again as harry approaches
chad looks over to his right on a hanger the brown pinstripe coat that matches harrys pants
the closet door is thrown open
harry jerks up the gun which hes pulled from the shoulder holster in his other hand and bam shoots chad in the face
the gun bucks
unused to the recoil and still screaming harry staggers back and trips over the edge of the bed and drops the weapon
he crabs briefly backward and then flips over and scrambles off on all fours
in the hallway he rises and tramples down the stairs
he stops at the bottom of the steps panting
he looks back up the steps trying to control his heavy breathing so that he can listen
a long silence
he looks around
he opens a drawer closes it opens another
harry enters from the kitchen and starts slowly mounting the stairs a chopping knife in one hand
harry tops the stairs
he pauses looking at the bedroom door ajar
inside his gun lies on the floor
harry takes cautious steps toward the door
he pauses at the cracked door
he plunges through the door and runs for the gun and scoops it dropping the knife
he stands and spins panting
his point of view the closet
its door ajar
legs protrude into the room as if chad hidden within is sitting with his back against the closet wall contemplating his next move
harry walks cautiously over
with a bare foot he experimentally waggles one of chads feet
harry nudges the door
it creaks fully open
chads face is a powder burned chewed up mess
omygod who are you
he gingerly crouches down
he tries to avert his eyes as he feels in chads suit pockets
omygod my god
he comes away with a wallet and hastily stands
inside are a few dollars and nothing else no credit cards drivers license empty
what the fuck
he leans back in trying not to look but for some reason feeling obliged to return the wallet
as he opens the suit coat to slip it back in the inside pocket he notices the suit label has been cut away
he fingers the raveled fringe
oh my fuck
he straightens up again
i killed a fucking spook
he gazes down at the body
what are you doing here you fucker
we track at floor level following the well shined shoes of someone walking down the well polished hallway
we are low outside an office door
the shoes enter frame and the door is swung inward away from us to show palmer debakey smith seated behind his desk
he looks up
the door slams shut
some time later
our camera position is higher
at the cut the door swings open and palmer smith strides out grim faced
tracking behind his shoes down a different piece of hallway
palmer smiths back enters and he swings the door open
a silver haired man looks up from his desk where he is leaned back eating orange sections off a paper towel on the desktop
not quite certain sir but its
he seats himself facing the desk
a desktop nameplate identifies his superior as gardner mcc
palmer hands a folder across grimacing
kolyma tells us that they have computer files from an ex analyst of mine osbourne cox
our man in the russian embassy
it was brought to them by a woman who the russians
it was brought in by linda litzke an associate of a guy named harry pfarrer
pictures in the folder
treasury agent whos been um screwing mrs
must be how they got the files
or maybe ozzie knows about it they all seem to be sleeping with each other
but this treasury guy its gotten
he just shot somebody in ozzies house

palmer shakes his head
ozzie wasnt there
our man surveying hears a gunshot sees the treasury guy wrestle something into his car follows him he dumps a body in the chesapeake bay
well whatd he do that for

gardner chubb is flipping bemusedly through the contents of the folder
well so we dont really know what anyone is after

he reaches the folder back to palmer
for now just keep an eye on everyone see what they do

and keep an eye on everyone see what they do
report back when um i dont know
when it makes sense
his hands are on his hips
he is darkly mediterranean and very fit
he smiles into the camera as he hops in time to upbeat music kicking a leg out on each beat
to the left
to the right
wider shows that the man is on tv leading the viewer in exercise
the viewer in this case is osbourne cox on his boat
he follows along in his underwear in the cramped quarters belowdecks
boxes and luggage are strewn about half unpacked
he pants as he exercises im bigger
we are on a long lens point of view from several cubicles over of linda slumped at her desk head in her arms
we faintly hear her sobbing
reverse shows ted treffon the soulful manager of hardbodies looking at her unsettled
we are in her cubicle now her weeping bumping up at the cut
a tap against the cubicle window brings her head up
ted treffon opens the door
im fine ted im sorry
he sits at the chair alongside her desk

he looks down
linda still has his hand
he tries to cover his reaction to the physical contact
we just dont give that out at hardbodies
the phone beeps
a voice comes through the intercom linda theres a mr
krapotkin on line two
she punches a button on the phone
this is ilan krapotkin
returning your call
ted im sorry

looking at her ted sighs
he shakes his head sadly rises and goes
linda pushes the door of the cubicle shut with her foot

linda glances up
outside her cubicle window ted waits at lindas look he turns palms up whats going on
linda holds up a finger one second
do you know where he is
is he not
no i look can i come in and discuss this
harry pfarrer stands at the kitchen counter chopping carrots
he is intensely focused and chops very very quickly producing slices in high volume
reverse shows katie cox in a chair in the living room frozen in a look up a file of papers forgotten in one hand as she gazes over half glasses
his chopping continues unabated
after a long look and much chopping you seem distracted
still chopping do i
the last two days
the chopping continues
katies eyes shift down to the countertop back up to harry
thats enough carrots dont you think
for the salad
the chopping stops
harry slaps the knife down
he stares at katie jaw grinding for a beat
you know youre really a very negative person
through grit teeth ive tried
to ignore it
and stay upbeat
katie unused to backtalk from harry is stunned
she returns in a manner as hard as his harry stop the foolishness
stop the foolishness
you are not talking to one of your
her fingers form quotes shithole buddies
harry glares at her vibrating with rage
her look at him is equally hard
harry abruptly turns and stomps up the stairs
brief tromping on the second floor
katie sits in puzzled suspense
footfalls descend the staircase
harry reappears at the foot of the stairs with his wedge cushion tucked under an arm
he flings the front door open goes out slams it shut
harry stomps to his car in the driveway and flings in the cushion
he gets in seething
after a beat he pulls out his cell phone and dials
a female voice hello

something wrong harry
can you come home
your baby needs you
can you please come home
harry you know i i can show you your present
i cant just leave the book tour
there are two days left
theres still seattle
i love you harry

he folds the phone miserable
as he pockets it his attention is caught by something in the side view mirror the car parked across the street
a mans shape in the drivers seat
harry jaw set gets out of the car and starts down the drive
the parked car starts
the car tries to pull out but is closely hemmed in by cars front and back it will need a couple moves
harry runs back to his own car starts it throws it into reverse and backs straight down the drive toward the frantically shuttling car
he t bones it
harry amped throws his car into drive pulls halfway up the driveway
he again throws the car into reverse
the man in the other car abandons his attempt to pull out and scrambles frantically toward the passenger side
harry again smashes into the car
the other man emerges from the far side
he flees down the sidewalk as fast as his weight will permit pocket change jingling yelling as he runs fucker
harry runs after him calling who do you work for
who do you work for
the overweight man does not have harrys stamina harry closes leaps and tackles
he crawls up the mans body hand over hand panting who do you work for
the other man is panting much harder tuchman marsh
this stops harry
he isnt sure what hes heard
your name is
tuchman marsh hauptman rodino
harry stares at the man underneath him
the gasping man explains i work for them

which is a law firm
a rock band
yes its a law firm

harry is blindsided
he slowly sits up digesting my
my wife hired you
the freed tuchman marsh man also sits up still panting heavily
your wife hired tuchman marsh
tuchman marsh hired me
i work for tuchman marsh
youre youre a divorce detective
credit missing persons whatever
but this is divorce
harry rises and walks stiffly zombie like up the street
the man watches him go
after a few paces harry stops and sits on the curb
he starts weeping
the man still breathing heavily calls out jesus grow up man
it happens to everybody
harrys cell phone chirps
he fishes it out and unfolds it sniveling
harry its osbourne cox
harry stares trying to fit this in
osbourne prompts after a silent beat harry
harry could i get your wifes number
this is osbourne cox could i trouble you for your wifes you cant tell her anything she doesnt already know fucker
harry again stares maybe he has this figured wrong
after a silence is this
echoing up the street blue revision
can i use your phone
to call a tow
osbourne paces the cramped cabin belowdecks a phone to his ear
he is unshaven wearing a robe
filtered rings then a connection hello
hi its osbourne cox how are you
sorry to call out of the blue but i have a well a publishing question and i thought you might be the person to ask i have this manuscript something
to do with my professional experiences not to go into too much detail but i think its pretty explosive stuff and i think that it could merit a fairly wide readership handled properly and it isnt quite finished yet but theres a situation where im worried about it leaking now and maybe excerpts being published or on the internet whatever without my permission and a lot of the impact being um blunted so im actually anxious to bring it to market sooner than id planned i mean like now in fact so i was thinking i know you and you seem to do well so i was wondering if you were happy with your publisher
the people you use
a long beat
youve written a childrens book
no no a a kind of a memoir but doesnt your company have an adult arm
or isnt it uh the childrens arm
of a regular publisher
pappas swain do childrens literature
so they dont okay
are you well
very well thank you
okay well thank you sandy
good talking to you
osbourne yanks the rubber band off a bundle of mail
two pairs of footsteps echo down a long hallway as linda litzke is escorted by a solemn russian staffer
a waiting room
a long beat linda sits waiting
a door opens
linda stands to go to the inner office but krapotkin motions her back down
can we help you
what kind of mickey mouse embassy are you running
ive been waiting here for fifty five minutes and im i am so sorry madam
an urgent matter
well this could be urgent too since you know chad has been missing for forty eight hours now and i dont know the whereabouts of chad madam
well he was gathering information for you when he were not interested in such information

linda is dumbfounded
a silent beat
krapotkin fishes something from his pocket
would you like your disk back
krapotkin stands with the disk extended toward her
im so sorry i cant help you
linda recovers from her astonishment and is moved to outrage ill tell you whats dribble
you listen to me mr
i am blue revision
looking the opposite way
we hear two pairs of footsteps
they approach for several beats and then linda and her escort enter frame and recede footsteps echoing
the staffers hand is on lindas elbow
as we hold on their backs and they continue to walk linda jerks her arm away the staffer regrabs it
she jerks away again
cut it out
an exercise show plays on the tv unwatched
osbourne sits at a little table looking at a notice torn from a windowed envelope
he brings the notice close squints at it
what the fuck
he quickly shuffles through the rest of the mail pulls out another envelope rips it open
osbourne paces drink in hand staring at another piece of mail
what the fuck
osbourne is back at the table drink half consumed listening at the phone
yes i want to know why the check for my slip fee was returned for insufficient funds
slip fee for docking my boat the check was returned

my savings account
i dont know the fucking number

we are looking at the exterior of the house in wide shot
from inside the house though we can faintly hear sobs punctuated by sounds of exertion
each gasp of effort ends in a dull clang
the wracking sobs bump up loud at the cut inside
harry is weeping as he demolishes the love seat with a sledgehammer
blue revision a
ted stares horrified
after a beat no o o o o o way
no way linda
she sits opposite him in his office
ted shakes his head
but ted i cant do it i dont know anything about computers

weeping she storms out
ted stares shell shocked
in close shot ted sits onto a bar stool
dim bar tinkling piano
whatll it be
ted stares straight ahead
a long beat
he finally focuses on the bartender off
linda is asleep in her bedroom
the buzz of the in house intercom
linda stirs wakes and reaches for the bedside phone
hurrow she removes an appliance from her mouth
harry is gazing off slack jawed haunted
after a beat you think a marriage is
and then you
the thought drifts off
a sad shake of the head
linda enters handing him a drink
she sits opposite
but this was a long time coming
harry looks up surprised
he catches himself
his gaze wanders back to the haunted empty spot
youre depressed harry
hollowly i am depressed
i gotta exercise
i havent run in three days
do you think i could stay here for a little while
linda starts quietly weeping
this focuses harrys attention
he looks at her as if just now noticing her
whats wrong baby

harry moves next to her and puts an arm around her
whats wrong baby
youre not here for me

piece of cake
illuminated by a small light
the tongue starts to rise and the mouth starts to close
no stay open
wider a pediatric examining room decorated with colorful prints of cartoon characters and clowns
katie cox in a white smock has a tongue depressor in a five year olds mouth and a light sight in one hand
she withdraws both as the child finishes closing his mouth
the childs mother stands by
katie grasps the child by the upper arm
you have to let the doctor look in your mouth
the child keeps his lips pressed together
now you listen to me young man
you do as i say or ill ask your mother to leave the doctors office and the two of us will sort out whats what
the child looks at her fearfully
the wall phone bleeps
katie rolls to it on her castored chair
she listens briefly
with a patient
she hangs up
osbourne in dressing gown and pyjamas is barking into the phone
the same patient shes been with since yesterday
cox has suggested you call her attorney yeah right
tell her i got the new fucking keys
he slams down the phone
the hatch is thrown open and osbourne emerges from below
there is a large built in toolbox just by the hatch
he yanks it open and pulls out a hatchet
osbourne strides grimly down the dock in his bathrobe hatchet in hand
sandy pfarrer is sitting in an armchair on a morning show living room set surrounded by a dozen eight year olds sitting on the carpet
hosts del and connie sit next to her in swivel chairs
reading and it was just then at that very moment that oliver sneezed can we just im sorry to interrupt but we have to let the folks at home see
can we just get a shot of that
he is holding the book open face out on his lap
there there it is
interrupting the filibuster with
the book is point of order oliver
and the talented author is sandra pfarrer
were gonna go to a station break and then be right back with bud fraighling the sultan of salad and part two of our special interview with dermot mulroney
so keep it where it is
del and connie and sandy all wear smiles that stay fixed a beat too long
then del relaxes and turns to sandy
yeah you know we thought it might be fun if you joined us with bud fraighling and help make the fiesta salad when we move over
over on the kitchen set
that wasnt discussed
only if you want to
your segment went great we just thought im sorry i made plans
great to see you again sandra
she gives them a cold smile as a technician finishes unclipping her lavaliere and she leaves
connie looks at del and mouths bitch
osbournes crumple backed car roars up
it cuts a corner of the lawn and squeals to a halt in the drive
osbourne emerges still in robe and pyjamas with the hatchet
he goes to the front door and bashes at the knob with the blunt end of the hatchet
hows this for access
hardware starts to fall off and jangle onto the stoop
osbourne tries the sharp end of the hatchet a couple times decides he prefers the blunt end
hows this for motherfucking access
more things fall off
the knob wobbles in the door
osbourne pushes the door open
sandy pfarrer is accompanied by a bright young pr woman
that was way out of line
we were so unbelievably clear with them just an oliver segment
del and connie are such putzes
great uh sandy entered her dressing room is already shutting the door on her
inside a man lounges reading a magazine
he looks a little like harry but younger
thought that would never be over
the man rises and kisses her
let me scrub this crap off my face
osbourne opens a cabinet muttering just for starters
he takes out liquor bottles and starts putting them in a packing case on the kitchen counter
people sit on benches eating lunches
harry pfarrer is on the bench where he and linda met once again spitting sunflower seeds
linda walks up
they greet each other with a kiss
hello there sunshine
you look great
well you seem better
harry does indeed seem more like his old self
yeah i snuck in a little gym time this morning
and our exercise last night didnt hurt
linda is shocked but secretly pleased harry
boy i am through banging my head against the wall
i am gonna start doing whats right for me
thats how i believe also
you have to do whats right for yeah
i mean i had a shock recently and i realized you know life is not infinite
no ones immortal
no ones immortal
you have to get from each day its full uh squeeze the juice from every day because there but for the grace of god exactly
the important thing is to maintain a positive outlook
thats right dont sweat the small stuff
linda chimes in linda and harry and its all small stuff
harry reaches for linda and she slides closer
he puts an arm around her
this is where we first met
of course i do
you never know what the important days are until
the thought drifts away as his gaze fixes on something
with his look still fixed i told myself i was gonna stop being paranoid but
is that guy looking at us
linda follows his look
on a bench a short distance away a middle aged man with aviator glasses and hair plugs is staring at them
hastily no no
a slightly overweight woman stops tentatively in front of the man in the aviator glasses and they start to talk
linda turns to harry
have you found out anything about chad
nothing yet ive made a couple calls
i dont think itll take long
oh yeah there are so many data bases now its a joke
relaxing now that he sees the man in aviator glasses engaged in conversation harry warms to his theme
back when i was in pp there was still some art to finding people
not any more
and now with the cell phones
pretty soon theyre gonna know where everyone is
at any given moment
i mean its almost the reality now
you would be amazed
did he when you left the jamba juice did chad say anything about where he might be going
oh i know where he was going
a residence in alexandria
on hillsboro drive
harry has stopped chewing
he is staring at her
linda feels obliged to fill the silence
linda doesnt know what to make of his fixed stare
the residence of a guy named osbourne cox
harry is beginning to look sick
a long silence
then quietly who are you
now linda stares unsure of what to make of the question
lindas eyes widen
she is a little frightened
people nearby turn to look
it is a scene
harry reaches up
he grabs her by the shoulders and shakes
linda is at sea
she answers in a small voice im
harry stares at her
a long beat
he leaps to his feet and looks around in a panic
his point of view sweeping the park
nearby the man with plugs though talking with his date is looking at him again
farther away a man sits in a curbside sedan
hard to say
harry turns and runs
osbourne sets the packing box heavily down on a bureau in the upstairs bedroom
the box is a third loaded up with liquor bottles
it also holds a mixed drink which osbourne now takes out
the ice cubes clink as he sips poking through things in the bureau
one drawer holds scarves and accessories and a large case
he opens the case and starts dumping jewelry from it into the cardboard box
he yanks his hand back and shakes it
he looks at the ball of his thumb
he sucks it
he carefully picks a brooch out of the jewelry case and flings it across the room
he resumes dumping jewelry into his box
he suddenly stops a faint knock
the front door
the knock repeats
the front door creaks open
osbourne carefully sets down his drink
he steps quietly to the closet and pulls a small cedar chest off a high shelf
linda flings open the door to her car parked on the street bordering the mall
she gets in and turns the ignition
pulling into traffic she checks her rear view and her look snags on a dark four door sedan pulling out a few cars back
it falls in behind her
its driver is a man in sunglasses
he reaches up and touches fingertips to one ear
she looks forward glances again at the mirror
another dark car pulls into the lane next to the first
its driver is also a man in sunglasses
downstairs osbourne rounds the corner from entryway to living room a handgun at the ready
his drink is in his other hand
ice cubes clink as he moves
the living room is empty
osbourne advances cautiously
a quick sidelong look at the kitchen
he proceeds to the basement door
she gives worried glances at her rear view
the light ahead turns yellow red
cars ahead stop
a rhythmic thudding sound
it almost makes her car vibrate
she looks around
she rolls down her window sticks her head out looks up
a black helicopter hovers overhead rotors thudding
a black clad body leans partway out
the person seems to be looking down
linda draws her head back in
oh for petes sake
osbourne is slowly descending the stairs gun and drink in either hand gun up ice cubes clinking
the basement comes slowly into view
someone stands behind his desk at the computer
osbourne descends further
he stops on the bottom step and stares at ted treffon the soulful manager of hardbodies
ted stares at him
a long silence between the two men
then quietly and you are
my wifes lover
then what are you doing here
osbourne takes the last step down
he advances slowly gun trained on ted
osbournes look holding on ted changes
i know you
youre the guy at the gym
ted licks his lips
im not here representing hardbodies
i know what you represent
you represent the idiocy of today
ted shakes his head
i dont represent that either
youre the guy when i went to ask about that moronic woman
shes not youre in league with that moronic woman
youre part of a league of morons
youre one of the morons ive been fighting all my life
my whole fucking life
but guess what
today i win
ted is shot in the upper chest
he grabs a three hole punch from the desktop and flings it at osbourne and charges
bang another shot goes off
ted barrels into osbourne knocking him over oooph
and goes on past him lumbering up the stairs
osbourne gets to his feet
ted staggers out of the house a hand pressed to his chest
he has reached the front lawn when osbourne emerges robe flapping pursuing with the hatchet
he quickly catches up to ted and whacks at him
osbourne whacks him down
he keeps whacking at him
gardner chubb is behind his desk
palmer debakey smith is seated across from him
gardner chubb rubs his forehead
wait a minute
wheres the treasury guy
in a detention room at washington dulles
he was trying to board a flight to venezuela
we had his name on a hot list the ins pulled him
