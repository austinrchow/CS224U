written by peter stone based on the novel by john godey th april
the busy block between th and th streets in the middle of a weekday afternoon
buses taxis trucks shoppers messengers teenagers
in one corner of the screen the time is superimposed now a man green is zoomed in on little of his actual face is visible because of his thick white
hair large bushy white mustache dark glasses and slouch hat
the rest of him is encased in a knee length raincoat
he wears gloves and is carrying a large brown paper covered package by a wooden handle attached to the twine securing it
the box has been addressed in black felt marker everest printing corp
and appears quite heavy
but green has the gait of a man
younger than he appears
as he turns and heads down a flight of stairs camera zooms in even more to the single word on a sign a level above the locals two above the
green appears and joins the line waiting to buy tokens
wordlessly he shoves two coins under the grille receives his token moves on drops it into the slot pushes through the turnstile and heads for one of the descending stairways
camera holds on a sign identifying his choice green comes off the stairs and arrives on a line with a placard that hangs over the edge of the platform bearing
the number black on a white ground indicating the point where the front of a ten car train stops
now the sound of a distant rumbling growing louder makes green turn
cross to the platforms edge lean out over the track and peer into the darkness of the tunnel beyond the far end of the platform
as the four lights amber and white markers over white sealed beam headlights come into view and the train roars and clatters into the station
camera pans with the head car as it stops its breaks sighing and a pair of doors in extreme foreground rattles open
camera now moves forward into the car then turns and through the still open door focuses on the t
cop still standing on the platform regarding green camera
from the platform featuring the conductor bud carmody as he leans out of his window surveying the station
he has a young boyish face surrounded by long curly red hair
the door to the conductors cab is open as bud continues to lean out the window
directly behind him is matson an older conductor of retirement age who is busy instructing the younger man
cmon kid out loud sos i can hear what youre doin
im checking the passengers getting on and off front and back okay its all clear im shut ting the doors
rear section pushes a button then the front section and the doors are closed
he pulls his head in and checks a row of lights on a panel
now i m checking the indicator box to make sure that the doors are all locked okay
the train starts with a jerk
igo back out the window for a distance of three car lengths to see that nobodys being dragged i remove my door key and then the skate key and then
i hit the transmitter button
into a mike fifty first street next stop the next stop is fifty first street
turning to matson howd i do
how come you wanna be a conductor anyway

watch it were cumin in
bud looks quickly off sees the approaching station and hits his transmitter button
no it aint fifty first street sorry the station is fifty first street
never say youre sorry kid somebodyll come back here an bust your goddam nose
bud sticks his head out the window remembers what matson told him and pulls it partially back in
shooting through the conductors window as the train enters the station
we flash by the rear enders those i waiting for the last car and gradually slow until we stop and we are looking right into the face of a man
grey whose frame and features while entirely different from greens are covered by the same identical externals thick white hair bushy white mustache dark glasses slouch hat gloves and raincoat
he looks at the conduc tor camera for an instant then darts away
riders entering and exiting the train as grey heads down track
he carries a large tan valise trimmed in dark brown
grey just makes it to the car as the doors close holding them back until hes squeezed through
the train starts with a lurch as he heads for the rear of the car and takes up a position leaning his back against the storm door and placing his
valise on the floor between his feet
he surveys the car with cold heavy lidded eyes
green has a seat opposite the shut steel door of the motormans cab
his package is on the floor between his knees his arms resting on its top
two boys ten and twelve brothers are at the window of the front storm door their eyes glued to the track and tunnel before them playing
at driving the train
bud is removing his key and activating his mike
grand central station next stop the next stop is grand central
yeah if i was you id start studyin for that motormans exam right now
to tell you the
matson i have been
want to hear some thing
every car on the irt is seventy two feet long cost and weighs pounds
it holds seats with room for standing
cept at rush hour when you can push in another at least
honest to god i
know personally of a case where this guy on a number train dies of a heart attack at union square and he has t wait until the grand concourse in
the bronx before enough people get off sos he can fall down

he crosses to the nearest door as the train decelerates
his mike and announces waving to matson as he does
grand central station change for the express
this is grand central
the train stops the doors open and matson steps out colliding with a very large man brow
pn who is in a hurry to get aboard
his face is adorned with a large white bushy mustache dark glasses a lot of white hair a slouch hat and covering the rest of him a raincoat
he carries an outsized florists box big enough for several dozen long stemmed roses under his
arm and wears gloves
whats your hurry chief
we wont leave without you
brown says nothing to matson does not look at him does not even seem aware of their cohtact
matson goes off into the crowd on the platform and brown heads for the front of the car
still sitting still facing the motormans cab
the two boys continue to play at the front window
the doors can be heard slamming shut and the train jerks into motion
thirty third street next stop is thirty third street
suddenly greens hand clutches at his shirt collar unbut toning the top button and loosening his tie
he breathes a sigh of relief then notices that his left leg is vibrat ing
he quickly stills it by placing a hand on his knee
leaning back against the storm door
now he picks up his valise turns and
looks through the door across the platform between the cars into the fifth car and catches sight of brown who nods almost imperceptively
grey makes no sign of recognition at all
he turns and starts forward through the car heading for the third car
at the far end a man is standing in front of the door leaning down to talk to a seated girl
grey stops and waits a moment
finally your ass
the man looks around and surveys grey
what about it
the man glances at grey for a moment then moves it
grey opens the door and steps out onto the platform between the two cars
the tile mosaics spelling out th street
camera now dollies to a tight close shot of still another man with a white bushy mustache white hair dark glasses slouch hat gloves and raincoat blue
the time is superimposed a
blue stands at the downtown end of the platform near the number placard carrying a bulging canvas valpac in one hazed and a trombone case in the other
a rumbling sound is heard building until a train roars through on the northbound express track its lights flashing between the pillars
in a moment it is gone and the sound dies
now a young black
dressed in the latest extravagant pimps fashions flaring double knit trousers three inch heels wide lapeled jacket and white extra wide brimmed hat swaggers loose jointed to a spot near
blue and waits cool and relaxed
he becomes aware of blue observing him
whats wrong dude aint you never seen a sunset
blue smiles softly and looks uptrack
twenty eighth street next stop is twenty eighth street
green glances at his watch then turns to look at the storm door at the far end of the car
the far storm door with greys face seen through the glass
as he nods to grey
as grey comes back inside closes the door and wedges his hip securely against the brass handle
as the train roars in brakes and grinds to a stop
camera zooms in on a sign on the side of the first car pelham bay park until only pelham fills the screen
he hangs back until everyone has gotten on or off the train then without haste carrying the valpac in one hand and the trombone in the other he approaches the
front of the first car
the motorman denny doyle a middle aged man with a ruddy face and wearing pin striped overalls is leaning far gut of his window looking back along the platform
blue puts down his bags puts his right hand into his raincoat pocket and leans against the train with his left shoulder blocking doyles view of the rest of the
hey how do you expect me to
he stops suddenly aware that blue has removed a very large army automatic from his raincoat pocket and has placed the muzzle against his doyles head
doyle jerks his head back suddenly banging it hard against the windowframe
blue crooks his hand inside the window and now places the gun against the motormans cheek directly under his right eye
for gods sake
what do you want
im taking your train
as he hangs out his window of the fifth car looking down track trying to see doyle
blues lack by the head car blocking any sight of the motorman
confused for a moment then turn around i ve got some thing to show you
bud turns back inside the car then looks down
the snub nosed weapon has been pushed into bud s midsec tion
still against doyles cheek
blue speaks calmly and quietly
unlock your cab or
doyle seems dazed in a trance
blue presses on the barrel of his gun depressing doyles cheek
pay attention to me
open your cab door or i
come in and turn around slow
brown florists box and all has moved into the small cubicle
when bud pulls his head in from outside they are very close
as it gropes blindly for the latch finds it and turns it with a click
the door opens and camera tilts up to dis cover green standing outside
browns gun is still pressed into buds side
go back out the window and tell me what you see
bud nods licks his
dry lips and leans out looking to the left downtrack
blue is still leaning against the head car his back to us
theres someone leaning against the head car
the second he comes aboard shut the doors
now blue turns picks up his valpac and trombone enters the train and the doors close
as green has moved in with his large package a gun in his hand
doyle stares at him still terrified
get rid of your seat
doyle springs to his feet and swats up the folding seat with a clatter
just take it easy
now move over to the window and if you try to touch the mike pedal with your foot ill shoot it off
a sharp rapping at the door and green opens it
blue squeezes in placing his bags atop greens package
it is becoming very crowded in the cab as blue again pockets his gun
all right mr
a hundred percent
then get it started
green moves over to face the controls
he stares down at them for a moment then reaches with his left hand to the controller his right to the brake handle
pressing down firmly on the controller he nudges it to the left
as the train starts to move forward slowly
brown still holding his gun on bud
okay announce the next station
bud presses the transmitter button
twenty third street next his voice croaks then fails he cant finish
brown prods him with his gun
bud clears his throat then tries again
i next stop is twenty third street
come on were
taking a walk up front
as the train crawls slowly through the darkened tunnel
greens eyes are on the controls as blue and doyle watch the track
you say when mr
keep going youre still in switching
why dont you peg it up to series
youre green all the way through
were in no hurry
suddenly theres a popping sound and the power fails for a moment
she mustve bucked
you said you could drive this thing
it wasnt mel its the train she bucks all the time especially in switching
shes a dog
green glances quickly at doyle and grins
whats your name motorman
denny doyle sir

running a red signal
the trippers stopped us cold and i hadda climb down and reset em by hand but by that time control knew i was lying dead
i never got written up since
how about you
once on the canarsie thats right mr
green tell him all about yourself
green stops and looks at blue
theres the emergency power box
green knocks off his controller and eases the brake handle to the right
as the train slows and screeches to a stop
yeah im taking the brake handle and the reverse key denny and i want your cutting key too
he pulls the reverse key out of its receptacle and holds out his hand
doyle fishes into his overalls pulls out the large key and gives it to green who puts the brake handle and the two bulky keys into his two raincoat pockets
then squeezes by blue and the packages and goes out
as green comes out of the cab and closes the door after him
the two boys are still there
he smiles at them and starts back through the car
a couple of passengers glance at him but without interest
blue and doyle
youll be hearing from command center in a minute r two but youll ignore the call you wont answer is that perfectly clear
they can call all they
to im deaf
i want to stay alive
as green nears the storm door grey who stands guard in front of it glides to one side and opens the door for him
dont mention it mr
brown slides open the door for green then slides it shut again
they speak in low tones
give me your cab key
as bud hesitates you got three seconds to live conductor one two bud whips the key from his pocket and hands it to green who unlocks the cab door theyre
standing next to and enters closing the door after him
whats he going to do
you wouldnt want me to spoil the surprise
as green seats himself before the panel and begins arming it
he fits the brake handle into place then fishes
the reverse key out of his pocket it is five inches long with a shiny surface and a wrench type handle that fits into a receptacle on the flat portion
of the controller and finally inserts the cutting key similar to the reverse key but with a slightly smaller head and turns it
close shot subway train couplib gs as they disengage
blue and doyle waiting neither saying anything
sud command center calling pelham one two three come in please doyles foot moves toward the mike pedal and blue kicks him hard in the ankle
owl im sorry z couldnt help it its automatic pelham one two three do you read me
come in pelham one two three doyle looks imploringly but blue shakes his head
finally pelham one two three where the fuck are emu
l two men are walking at a rapid pace caz dolowicz super vising towerman an overweight man in his fifties and a plumber a short man dressed in overalls and
a cap carry ing a long wooden box of wrenches he struggles to keep up with dolowicz
the time is superimposed
whats the goddam hurry
i told you one of my towermen dropped his wedding ring down the john
yeah but whatre we runnin for
they pass the nedicks stand and caz pushes through a gate marked to supers office
how come that gate aint locked

christ it stinks down herel where the hell are we goin
then whatre we goin down hey slow up will ya
thats it up ahead those windows
what kinda tower
theyve come to the door of the tower room
they turn go up some steps and disappear inside
a long unadorned room with a row of desks with phones and a door marked toilet
several towermen and mrs
jenkins a black towerwoman sit at the desks before the flashing phone consoles talking to dispatchers trainmasters and other towers
the predominant feature of the room however i is the electronic model board stretched high across one wall recording in colored slashes of light the movements of every train that
passes through the sector all of it superimposed on a painted map showing the lines track routes and stations
one of the towermen marino rushes over to caz as he and the plumber enter
jesus christ caza you picked a helluva day to be late you wanted a plumber down here didnt you
whose goddam wedding ring was it
im sorry mr
dolowicz it just slipped off
what were you doinr with your hand in the john anyway

hes laying down between th and rd
what the hell for
couple three minutes
command centers been trying to raise him but so far he dont answer the radio
jesus caz why dont he answer the radio

maybe he jumped a ball and hadda leave the cab to reset a tripper or a door got hung and he hadda go fix it

its been too long caz then maybe his radios busted and the sonuvabitch is too lazy to climb down and use a telephone
im gonna write him up for
this goddammit im gonna have his assn hey its moving
everyone wheels around to stare up at the board
for jesus christ sake
the dumb bastards moving backwards
slowly the second to the tenth cars are moving away from the first car which continues to lie motionless on the track
the rear cars roll about a hundred feet
as green leaning out the window and looking behind him now applies the brake handle and the train grinds to a halt
caz marino and the others are staring up at the model board
hes stopped again
stopped is better than backwards
as green removes the brake handle and the two keys stuffs them back into his pockets and leaves the cab
brown and bud are waiting as green steps out
bud stares at him
whats wrong with you
i didnt know these thingsd c o o backwards
lets go mr
he opens the storm door and holds it as green goes through first
as green comes out onto the threshold plate crouches low to ease the impact then jumps down onto the concrete roadbed
bud is next and green helps him down
they walk quickly throughthe tunnel to the first car
grey has opened the storm door for them and steps out onto the plate to help them up
blue and doyle the latter watching wide eyed as the former opens his trombone case and removes a submachine gun
he checks it then sets it aside and removes the cord from greens package
come in pelham one two three for chrissake come in i blue opens the package removing a second identical automatic weapon
as he checks it out a rapping sounds at the metal door and blue opens it
green squeezes in

picking up his submachine gun and holding it vertically along his pants leg blue eases himself through the door and shuts it after him
pelham one two three can you hear me pelham ond two three
green quickly replaces the brake handle and eases the controller to the left
as the single subway car starts to move slowly forward
as a set of red slashes begin to flicker
all eyes staring up at the board camera
shes moving again forward this time
i got eyes havent i
well whatever it was hes okay now thank god
it is moving slowly
blue stands by the cab his gun still held hidden behind his leg
he looks down the length of the car
he undoes his flower box and removes another submachine gun
he has opened his valise and has taken out still another submachine gun which he grins at happily
he comes forward to the center of the car now making no attempt at inconspicuousness any more
some faster than others the passengers in the car are either distracted from their reading or talking or around from their limbo of subway dead headedness
registering different degrees of interest surprise confusion or in
some cases upon seeing the guns fright and even terror they turn to face blue
there are some sixteen of the black modishly dressed pimp in his s seen earlier on the station platform

this news is met in stony awe struck terrified silence
except for the pimp who smiles seemingly relaxed
i shoulda knowd you was the main man man
as the slowly moving car comes to a stop
he is staring up at the board

the large granite f aced building in the borough hall complex
the following legend is superimposed elevators and the information desk
clive prescott a black plainclothes lieutenant in the transit police is pacing waiting
the time is superimposed
a uniformed transit cop sits behind the desk watching him
finally an elevator door opens and a smart efficient secretary emerges followed by four japanese in business suits
prescott it was nice of you to leave your duties long enough to show our distinguished guests around the facilities
may i present mr
mat sumoto mr
tomashita and mr
the small framed
orientals bow in turn
who are all directors of the tokyo metropolitan subway system

clive prescott of our own transit authority police
a pleasure gentlemen
when youre through the chairman would like to say goodbye per sonally so send them up to thirteen will you

she smiles at the japanese and walks back to the elevators pressing the up button
prescott looks at the four men for a moment uncertainly then goes after the secretary and speaks to her in low tones
eak english dont they
were not sure
weve been proceeding on the assumption that they do
the elevator door opens and she steps in smiling sweetly
the door closes
prescott shrugs then turns and smiles at the visitors
they smile back
he takes a deep breath then begins
the new york city subway system is the largestin the world with miles of track and seven thousand cars that carry over a billion and a third passengers every year
making it also the busiest railroad in the world
i can see that this last fact surprises you
the japanese look anything but surprised
prescott goes on resolutely
well grand central is the busiest station passenger wise train wise its west th st
on the i
now if youll step this way gentlemen they step no way at all
prescott gestures broadly
this way he hurries ahead of them to open the door and hold it for them as they finally follow
we are entering the headquarters of the transit police occupying the entire second floor of this building
we call it the nerve center
a huge police map covering one wall divided into pastel shadings of yellow red orange blue and green showing the various areas of the system
colored lights red an yellow are continually changing and flickering
the status board pinpoints the disposition of every transit authority policeman presently in the field
things are usually jumping pretty good in here
camera begins to zoom back revealing the scene a large room cut
up by glass dividers into a maze of squares and rectangles manned by uniformed t
policemen sitting at desks with telephone consoles
the place is absolutely dead some reading some eating some sleeping
we have one of our own t
cops on every station and every train in the entire system between the hours of eight p
and four a
since we instituted this watch weve out crime in the subways by about
cap era has finished its zoom and now pans to include prescott and his four japanese
im sure you have your own share of crime on the tokyo subway right
they merely stare at prescott and smile
clears his throat loosens his tie and looks around for help
uh follow me gentlemen he starts off through the room the japanese following
these are the assignment desks one for each of the three lines the i
and the i
over here the oper ations lieutenant sol garber
prescott has stopped beside a desk
garber stocky dour with a dark stubble that requires shaving twice a day is absorbed reading the village voice
uh sol id like you to meet some friends of the chairman
garber looks up over his paper for a moment
good friends of the chairman
theyre uh directors of the tokyo subway

to be a cantaloupe
he and prescott look at the japanese
how about another one sol
well uh thursday there were three unrelated knife fights in a single half hour two dead and three wounded one critical
the japanese smile
im busy clive okay
he goes back to his newspaper as prescott leads his four charges away
in the course of a normal week the t
police have to deal with such crimes as robbery assault murder drunkenness injury illness vandalism abusiveness sexual molestation and exhibitionism
you know flashing
to illustrate he waves a bottom corner of his jacket at the japanese who nod appreciatively
then he lifts a pistol from his shoulder holster just far enough to show the handle
we carry firearms of course off duty as well as on and were fully empowered to make arrests
in fact youre all four under arrest right now
you get me
im tossing you all in the pokey and throwing away the key
he smiles and they smile back
he feels much better
all right you creeps lets go upstairs to the command center
they start off
as a taxi pulls up and caz jumps out after paying the hey
these are subway tokens sounder than the u
he disappears down the steps
a train is standing with its doors open and lit within only by the emergency bulbs
caz hurries south along the platform heading for the first car his ample stomach bouncing over his low slung belt camera leading him until he comes to the front of
the train and stops to talk to the motorman a grizzled old timer who needs a shave
when did the power go
who wants to know
the supervisor of the grand central tower wants to know
oh sure it went a couple of minutes ago
he starts off
what happened down there a man under
who wants to know
as caz comes to the end of the platform climbs down to the roadbed and starts through the darkened tunnel
he breaks into a trot only to slow to a walk and then stop as he sees something approaching in the darkness a large crowd of people being guided by
doyle who uses a flashlight
caz scratches his head
what now for chripsake
as blue surveys
the rear section is empty
the sixteen remaining passengers and bud are sitting quietly
brown and grey stand mid car guarding from that side
now blue joins green at the front end
what timeve you got mr
time to start
any thing you want to say first
iin going to die today could be
he turns and enters the motormans cab
pelham one two three do you read me now
shooting dot n at the enormous block long high ceilinged area in which the three divisional units irt bait and ind are scattered widely using so little of the space
that the arrangement looks provisional
over this one voice can be heard corrells continuing from the previous scene

camera pans to pick up prescott as he leads his four japanese through the room moving and speaking rapidly
each train is identified by the name of its terminus and the time of its departure thus an express leaving woodlawn at p
would be woodlawn six three oh while on its return trip its new destination might be flathush eight two five
i hope youre memorizing all this junk im going to ask questions later
he has said this within earshot of a dispatcher who now reacts
jesus prescott have you lost your marbles or what

he disconnects turns and shouts
sargent get me our guy at lex bedlam
the train still stands idly empty now its doors closed
theres a crowd milling about some pounding futilely at the doors of the train others just standing around waiting
artis james a black t
cop is talking
to a small group of irate citizens
he carries a radio on a strap over his shoulder

i saw him a couple of minutes ago lieutenant he was headed down track on foot

caz is hot in conversation with doyle as the long line of passengers files by on their way out of the tunnel
i dont give a goddam what they were armed with your job is to
stay on that train until you get authorization to leave
they said theyd kill me for gods sake
youre like the captain of a ship youre supposed to go down with it
as he passes bullshit
all right tell command center im on my way to investigate

hey i wouldnt if i were you
i know you wouldnt
he leaves doyle and starts down the track
a few passengers in the line call to him
you work for the ubway

he is trotting following caz passing the line of passengers headed the other way
ill tell you whose goddam fault it is its the mayors goddam fault
whys it his fault
cuz hes the head o the city aint he
that makes him respon sible
they oughta impeach the bum
as he sees the first car ahead of him and as he gets closer the silhouette of a man grey through the rear storm door window
he stands guard at the rear storm door
now he sees some thing moving in the tunnel and slides open the door calling
stop right there cowboy
as they look around surprised
who the hell are you
the voices echo and distort in the tunnel
youll find out if you take another step
he is scooting along crouched hearing the voices advancing from pillar to pillar using each for a brief instant of concealment
im warning you mister thats city property youre fooling around with i
thats just too fucking bad
why didnt you ga grab a goddam airplane like everybody else
were afraid of flying
tellin you buster clear out or i ill shoot your ass off
stand back im coming on board
he starts forward
i warned you stupid i dead silence as camera advances toward grey
now the sub machine gun hes pointing at caz camera begins spitting fire and spewing out the spent shells
only his face as his eyes and mouth open wide in shock and disbelief and sudden death
his face peeking out from behind a pillar the flashes from greys gun reflected in his eyes and on the pillar
as he continues firing
astonished unfeeling horror struck
as his dead body hits the ground bounces and rolls over face up eyes still open
the sound returns with a rush
blue rushes out of the motormans cab and runs down the length of the car camera following as he goes past green and brown without speaking to them
he looks out the rear or for a moment at the dead body
i warned the bastard but he kept on coming anyway
was he alone
i didnt see anybody else
i guess i got us on the scoreboard huh
without a word blue moves to brown at mid car
take over back there
i want mr
grey up closer to me so i dan keep an eye on him
he s a little trigger happy
maybe it was necessary i didnt see it
he loved every minute of it
as he peers around the pillar hes hiding behind
smoke from the gun still hangs in the air
he ducks back behind the pillar unslings his radio and holding it close to his mouth whispers into it
patrolman james calling operations this is garber it comes in too loud and james frantically lowers the volume
whats going on

un shaven lying in bed the covers
pulled up to his chin suffering from the flu a glass of juice on his bedside table along with sprays and vials of pills and the nurse an elderly white

he disconnects and sits back in his chair staring at the ceiling
christ to hear you pleading with that chickenshit it makes me ashamed to be an american
go away frank go play with your trains
as blue steps out of the cab
green is staring at the hostages nervously
everything quiet out here mr
yeah except i think weve got our selves a cop
what do you mean
one of the hostages fuzz if i ever saw it
on the right on the right side of the car from face to face
the fourth fifth sixth seventh thats him next to the freak its the w
type who is staring off into space i sitting next to the hippie who seems hypnotized by his own wiggling toes
you ever see anybody look more like a cop
id better frisk him
he walks slowly down the aisle and stops
in front of the on your feet
you heard me stand up
nervously the man stands
blue frisks him quickly and expertly
when he fails to find a weapon he takes the mans wallet
okay you can sit down
as the man sits blue looks through the wallet
you ever been told you look like a policeman
all the time but i cant help blue tosses the wallet back into the teachers lap then turns to face the other hostages
listen to me everybody
im sure youve all figured out what happening by now youre hostages
the passengers some groaning some frightened the puerto rican crossing himself the hippie smiling softly etc
shot blue r that means when we get what we want youll be released unharmed
until then you will continue doing precisely as youre told
and if you dont get what you want
we expect to get it
the brooklyn bridge and the myriad ramps leading onto the drive
an official city limousine curves around a ramp and heads uptown its siren wailing
the time is superimposed
the police commissioner sits alone in the back seat
hes on the phone
from the front seat music can be heard coming from the radio
f this is the police commissioner get me theborough commander
to the driver turn off that goddam music will you george
im heading up to see the mayor right now
whats it look like down there
the borough commander sits on the front seat of a prowl car his feet hanging out the open door talking on the phone
around him spectators cops activity noise and confusion
its murder phil as usual theyre coming out of the woodwork
i wouldnt be surprised if we got a couple of thousand thrill seekers they really smell blood on this one
your barriers up
hell yes and were pushing the overflow into the side streets
we arent gonna win any new friends do we ever
how about traffic
i stuck a patrolman at every inter section from th to th and crosstown from nd to th
whos your number two
deputy chief inspector daniels
c ontd from special operations
hes a good man phil he handled that protest at bryant park last month
how are you deployed
ive got about fifty men inside the as we see what the borough commander describes riot police armored and helmeted scurrying into positions resembling a commando raid
north and south of the train well concealed all wearing vests and armed with machine and sub machine guns shot guns riot guns hand guns tear gas grenades and a
half dozen snipers with night scopes
we could fight the goddam third world war down there
just make sure they stay out of sight if the hijackers see them we may have a massacre on our hands
we have a snipers report that theyre moving around inside the car pretty freely and the one in the motormans cab is fully exposed and a damn easy shot
under no cirl umstances
do you understand me phil
were taking their threats seariously
whatve you got above ground
th street borough commander again if feasible we can see what he describes
trucks cars emergency medical and rescue units searchlights bullhorns the works phil
ive got two men stationed at every emergency exit as far south as union square
any direct communications with the hijackers
its awkward as hell
command center in brooklyn has the only direct contact
harry tell me something will you
theyre in a tunnel surrounded on all sides top and bottom how the hell do they expect to get away
beats the shit out of me phil
as the commissioners car swings into the circular drive leading to the side entrance and comes to a lurching stop the siren trailing off behind three other official black limousines
the commissioner jumps out and trots up onto the verandah
as he sneezes into a kleenex
as camera pulls back he dries off his upper lip wads the tissue and throws it onto the floor
jessie his wife with frosted hair and harlequin glasses jumps up from a chair and retrieves it
nate for gods sake
she baskets it then turns to warren lasalle
warren tell him other mayors have to use the house after were gone
theres a knock and warren hurries to open the door
in walk three men the commissioner the controller and the chairman of the transit authority
thanks for coming up on short notice fellas you all know jessie dont you
the police commissioner the controller the chairman of the transit authority
yes its nice to see you again
mayor hi jess good afternoon
coffee for everybody and some cake
uh better skip it jessie were running a little short of time
we all know whats going on underground right
so the main issue is whether to pay the ransom or not
all the rest is secondary
what do you think
well were fully mobilized i can go down there any time you say with enough firepower to wipe out an army but i cant guarantee the safety of the hostages
in other words youre for paying the rarlsom
we dont want another attica on our hands do we
so your vote is
the safety of the passengers is the only concern of the transit authority
pay the two dollars
sure two dollars id pay
but its a million barfly a one with six zeroes
is it coming out of your pccket
come on sid save the poor mouth for later
how do you vote
im not through discussing it yet
yes you are
my concern is with the taxpayers someones oughta be
millions for defense but not one cent for tribute
so thats a no
all right nate youve heard from the three wise men what do you say
everyone turns to the mayor
he sneezes into a kleenex and tosses it onto the floor
whatre they gonna say warren
everybody the press the man on the street he means the voters
just what youd expect the times will support you on purely humani tarian grounds the news knock you for coddling criminals and the post will take both sides at the
as for public opinion youll carry manhattan lose queens and staten island and split down the middle in brooklyn and the bronx
the rich support you likewise the blacks the puerto ricans wont give a shit
so how about it nate
stop trying to bully everybody warren this is supposed to be a democracy
were trying to run a city not a goddam democracy
stop farting around
weve got to pay
what do you say jess
i know a million dollars is a lot of money but just think what youll get in return
seventeen sure votes
go ahead warren arrange for the pay off
as everyone rises you heard it fellas
phil pass the word to the bad guys that were coughing up
sid what bank do we do the most business with
city national trust ill give em a call
ill call youre liable to spend an hour trying to knock down the interest rate
come on everyone downstairs lets move it
the mayor and jessie are left alone
she picks up the crumpled kleenex
i thought i handled it all right
a regular fiorello laguardia
as blues hand is busy filling in a word
a knock is heard and camera pulls back as blue opens the door
as blue shakes his head theyre sure taking their time
dont worry theyre going to pay
they have no choice
at first i thought to myself five of em are spades whos gonna pay anything for spades
but they dont know who weve got do they
it wouldnt matter if all seventeen were dope pushers they have to pay so relax
i know they have to but what if they dont
then a lot of people are going to die
either you live or you die
its y not better than trying to sell mutual funds for example
did you do that
i thought you were in the army
thats where i developed my expensive tastes
in the army
sure on three fifty a month
the biafrans paid me twenty five hundred for leading a battalion
holy christ l whyd you ever get out of that

stretcher for him

prescott turns and sees that the others at nearby desks have been watching and listening
he stares back at them for a moment
then checks his watch
twenty five minutes after that we can start scratching them off one per minute
shooting down the length of the car
most of the passengers excepting the wino lady and the hippie
both are enjoying their own reveries
your attention please at the far end brown guards the rear door
at mid car grey stands with his legs astride
including blue and behind him at the front storm door green
the city has agreed to pay for your release
no one quite knows how to greet this news except the pimp who slowly mockingly claps his hands together
far out man blue starts forward walking slowly looking at passengers on both sides of the aisle as he goes
as soon as the money gets here will you let us go
no but soon afterwards
do you mind telling us now how much youre getting
what difference does it make
a person likes to know his worth
a million dollars
thats not so terrific
blue still walking toward mid car stops at the hippies estended legs and taps the soles of his sandals with the muzzle of his submachine gun
pull in your feet someones liable to get hurt
hippie looks up at him smiles and slides his feet back
blue continues until he comes to grey
he speaks quietly to him
stop fooling around with that girl mr
whats the big deal
shes a twenty buck a trick hooker
i said leave her alone
dont worry i could do this job and hump that broad at the same time without missing a stroke
i once ordered a man shot for talking to me that way

blue ive always done my own killing

number the large stone fortress occupying the entire block its ground floor windows barred

the president stands in the middle of his large green rug putting golfballs at a gadget that automatically catapaults them back
as he finishes lining up a long one and is just about to stroke the office intercom buzzes
a little annoyed he crosses to his desk
the chairman of the city national trust on five seven he said its important
the president pushes a button putting the call on the speaker phone ar d he returns to his golf
hello ben what can i do for you

a seriea of head on television interviews with various individuals in the large crowd gathered at the scene
they all speak directly to camera with the voice of a well known six oclock news personality o
this is roger grimsby for eye witness news here at the inter section of th street and park avenue south the scene of this incredible subway hijack
a group of the blue helmeted cops manning the lines and pushing back part of the crowd
youre looking now at members of the t
the tactical police force as they attempt to deal with this enormous crowd which is con tinuing to grow every minute
officer officer this is eyewitness news an officer turns to camera
officer how would you estimate the size of this very large crowd
would you describe it as unruly
compared to some ive seen roger id have to say it was ruly
middle aged overweight
dyed blond hair
excuse me madam do you have any comment on the drama thats unfolding beneath our feet at this very moment
what particular part of the drama do you want me to comment on
some people feel that our subways have becomes jungles

wearing glasses and braces
would you feel more secure if instead of eight hours a day the trains and platforms were manned by the transit police twenty four hours a day
twenty four hours minimum
dogs all they gotta do is loose a pack of doberman pinchers an sic em onto that train yeah i definitely heard it on the radio theyre asking a million

presid ent is seen walking down the corridor
the president passes a few wooden trucks on wheels being pushed by armed guards
farther on his left cages marked paying receiving on the right sorting counting

the sorters mostly women occupy a large office of
the bull pen variety
each is sorting bills by denomination from a batch in her hand separating them almost faster than the eye can see into the slots of a counting machine deviating only
to throw old overused bills away into a basket
camera pans to correll in his shirtsleeves and sweating now jumping around checking teletype messages and bits of scratch paper talking over several phones at once
shut up and listen to me
all lexington avenue trains departing from dyer avenue and th street in the bronx

a silence in the room as everyone turns to watch prescott as he speaks into the mike

you son of a bitch
a single clerk is now assembling the ransom money
he selects ten bundles of fifties and five bundles of hundreds each bundle containing ten packets of one hundred bills and after cutting the strings holding the bundles together proceeds
to pair the packets into two hundred bill thicknesses one inch and fasten on the two rubber bands
blue as green enters the cab
i heard you on the radio anything wrong mr

it is now neatly piled together the fifteen thousand bills make a block approximately twenty inches high and twelve inches deep
camera pulls back as the clerk stuffs the money into a canvas bag then pushes it through a raised window
two guards take the bag leave the room cara following and hurry down a corridor to the right
another guard opens a gate leading to the security elevators
a police panel truck its motor running parked at the side walk in front of the loading bays
in front of the truck eight police motorcyclists astride their bikes the engines also running and occasionally racing them with a flick of the accelerator
the time is superimposed
it is manned by two patrolmen of the special operations divison wentworth the driver a young red headed man with a boyish face and ricci slightly older on the moody
it sure is taking them a helluva long time

he slams down the mike

as the two guards run out of the federal reserve each holding one end of the money sack each with his gun drawn and head for the police truck
the time is they throw it into the front seat on riccis side and slam the door
the motorcycles are already starting to move shoving off their sirens wailing and the truck starts after them
a cop on the corner waves the procession motorcycles and truck right on nassau one of the narrowest streets in the city cars are parked half up on the sidewalk
and they head uphill toward john street
from the roof of one of the office buildings as the police truck continues along nassau past john fulton ann and on toward beekman the eight motorcycles leading it
camera panning with the truck as it follows the cycles out of nassau a swing to the right at spruce and then enter ing park row with city hall on
their left heading up the wrong way against the traffic cops at every intersection
shooting through the windshield from the drivers point of view the eight cycles clearing the way the oncoming traffic pulling over and the expressions on the drivers faces as the
truck careens through
wentworth is grinning really enjoying himself
ricci holding the sack of money on his lap is scowling
beautiful really beautiful
ive always wanted to do this were scaring the shit out of everybody
whats wrong with you albert

as tires screeching the truck swings over to the right side of the street
traffic coming off the brooklyn bridge is being held up at the ramp
the time is superimposed camera pans with the truck as it passes chambers street and heads up centre
as the cycles sirens screaming followed by the truck race past the federal court building the city courthouse and the criminal courts building
hes on the radio

as a cop at the corner waves the cycles and truck left on canal the traffic ahead on centre being too heavy
the time is superimposed
wentworth and ricci the latter on the radio
proceeding west on canal street on our way to lafayette
keep it coming a youve got five minutes

enttiorth five minutes
no sweat albert you want to stop for a beer
jesusl look out i as the cyclists turn right onto lafayette against the on coming traffic lafayette is one way downtown at this point the two lead bikes sideswipe each
other and going out of control topple over sending their drivers sprawling
the truck slams on its brakes
screeching to a stop just short of the pile up
a sergeant manning the radio at the command post shouts to the borough commander who is off to one side issuing orders to a small squad of policemen
sir theres been an accident jesus christ i dont believe it
he starts for the radio in one of the vehicles
the time he grabs the mike
this is the borough commander what the hell happened
two cycles went down both riders got banged up pretty bad
theyll need an ambulance
drop off two more bikes to look after them and keep going do you hear me
as the truck led by only four cyclists now continues speeding north
the time is superimposed
fourteen david heading north on lafayette approaching vannrnare

o cs at him youre kidding around again
but i had you going there for a minute didn
t i albert
as it sits in the darkness
the time is superimposed
as now the seconds are shown running and will continue to do so throughout the following scenes
as the superimposed time continues running
and blue regards his watch
then he opens the cab door
green appearing at
coming up on one minute
have you decided which one its gonna be
does it make any difference
i guess not
whos gonna do it
does he know
he wont mind
neither would mr
with hint its just a job not kicks
he looks at his watch as the
superimposed time continues to run
to fifty seconds then we erase one
as the four motorcycles and the truck sirens all going whip through the intersection against the light a cop holding traffic
the superimposed time continues running
fourteen david crossing houston heading for cooper square youve still
got twenty eight blocks floor the sonovabitch
wentworth is bent over the wheel all determination now
tell him im doing over sixty now
holy christ the streets blocked
hold on im going through
shooting through the windshield as the superimposed time continues to run
the tail lights of the cycles are twinkling redas they begin braking a tractor trailer is stretched across the street lining up its rear end with the narrow opening of
a loading bay in preparation for backing into it
now the truck starts backing and while there is still some space open on the sidewalk it is closing fast
the cycles screech to a stop but it is clear that the truck doesnt intend to as it bumps up onto the sidewalk and starts for the opening
but it is now too narrow
the screeching brakes of the truck are heard as it starts to skid around the panorama flashing by sickeningly and perhaps a crash and perhaps the scene flopping over as
the truck perhaps rolls over onto one side
the police truck lying on its side its wheels still spinning the siren still running eerily
and the super imposed time still running
on the radio the time still superimposed and running
daniels for gods sake answer me
wheres that goddam money
hello prescott the trucks been wrecked somewhere on lafayette street
their radios gone dead what the hell are you talking about
it cant be wrecked were out of time goddammit
what do you want me to do

what do you mean thats all
theyre just about to shoot some poor sonuvabitch
what do they expect us to do
if they know were wrecked how can they ask us to they dont know anything for chrissake
how can they know anything down where they holy shit thats it
he punches a button on the console as the superimposed numbers now reflect the time down to the tenth of a second
fl shouting into radio pelham one two
the moneys arrived repeat the moneys arrived
you made it just in time prescott
the superimposed time freezes
prescott exhales sharply and sits back in his chair exhausted
the super imposed numbers disappear
you still there prescott
im still here
tell me something if we were a couple of seconds late youd have knocked off an innocent person
now if youre ready ill give you instructions for the delivery of the money
again ill have to insist you follow them to the letter
two unarmed policemen will walk down the track one with the money the other with a light which hell flash continuously from side to side in a sweeping motion
when they reach the car the rear door will open and the one with the money will throw it in onto the floor
then they will both turn and walk back to the th street station
ive got it
is that all
but keep it in mind that the same ground rules apply any wrong move by anyone and well kill a hostage
guessed that part
you have ten minutes to deliver the money
if it isnt here by then yeah i know its getting mono tonous
i dont suppose youll give us longer than ten minutes tens more than enough prescott
unless you werent telling the truth about the money having presco
i t its all right ten minutes is fine
no further discussions then
when we have the money in hand ill call you with the final set of instructions
you dont really think youre gonna get out of there do you
the clocks running prescott ive got three fourteen youve got until three twenty four
over you bastard
as two motorcycles sirens blasting push their way through the crowd and stop at the borough commanders command post
one driver alights and goes to help the other remove the canvas sack of money off the back of the second bike
they carry it together to the borough commander
well its about fucking time
you two he has addressed two uniformed men a transit cop miskowsxy and
a tactical policeman okeefe standing together drinking coffee out of containers
they hurry over and salute
which one has the flashlight
i do sir he shows it hanging from his belt
all right then you carry the money
now move it youve only got about eight and a half minutes
as they salute never mind the goddam salutes just get going
they take the sack from
the cyclists hike it up onto okeefes shoulder and hurry off running down the steps into the subway
now a chorus of booing is heaxd
christ its the goddam mayor
i dont see him no but i can sure hear him the mayor wrapped in a blanket is smiling and nodding as he passes through the crowd led by a
wedge of cops flanked on one side by the commissioner and on the other by warren lasalle
the boroughrcommander waits for him shaking his head in disgust
and to think that i voted for the ba stard
the mayorand entourage join him
hello commander his honor wants to go down into the tunnel with a bullhorn and make a personal appeal to the hijackers
im afraid not
i wasnt asking for your permission all you have to do is clear the way
the commander looks at the commissioner who stares right back blankly
then he turns to the mayor
i appreciate your wanting to help sir but youve come at a very bad time
commissioner will you order your man to comply
cool it warren the commander knows the situation here and we dont
nate im warning you i feel shitty warren im going back to bed
the mayor turns and starts back through the crowd warren chasing after him
for gods sake nate
subway tunnel r all that can be seen in the darkness is a flashlight its beam swinging back and forth coming toward camera
the time is superimposed
miskowsky and okeefe walking along the roadbed between the rails miskowsky swinging the flash okeefe
carrying the sack on his shoulder both looking around nervously camera moving with them
finally my names miskowsky
pleased t meet ya
you get the feelin were not alone down here
what do you mean
i thought i sawsomeone a couple of times in fact sharpshooters we got a couple dozen of em spread all over the place
theres one a figure in the shadows standing behind a pillar seen only in silhouette as camera passes him his helmet his high powered rifle etc
looking very menacing
you realize we got four submachine guns ahead of us and all those jokers behind us
i feel like im walkin into the fuckin o
look there it is i can see it
theres somebody standin in the rear door
the lone car lit from within and the silhouette of brown at the rear storm door
standing behind his pillar
now he turns his peaked cap around and turning his face to the pillar slowly moves his head to one side
shooting from behind the pillar
as the camera slowly crabs the subway car comes into view and we see brown standing at the rear door much more clearly than before
peeks around the pillar
now slowly he brings his right hand up and pointing his index finger
like a gun fires
pchoo pchoo pchoo he blows imaginary smoke from the end of his finger pleased with himself
from the other side of the pillar as james ducks back behind it turns his back to it and looks around for another way of amusing himself
he notices his real gun in a holster at his belt and unbuttons the strap freeing it
then he assumes the stance of a gunfighter hand poised over it knees slightly bent
then moving suddenly he slaps his holster wheels fires without aiming and theres a reverberating bang the shattering of glass and the figure in the subway car reels back
james looks at his hand in amazement theres no gun in it
then at the same time brown has recovered his balance and begins firing his submachine gun the bullets ricocheting off the metal pillars
as they drop onto the roadbed bullets whining all around them
for chrissake theyre shooting at us
okeefe pushes the sack of money in front of them and they press flat behind it
blue is hurrying from the conductors cab to the rear of the car passing between the two rows of stunned passengers who watch in silence
the storm door window has been smashed
and there is glass all over the floor nearby
brown is just in the process of sitting heavily in the single isolated seat near the door a dark red patch blossoming on his sleeve just below the right shoulder
his sub machine gun resting in his lap
he begins examining his wound with his left hand
grey s ands at the rear door pressed flat against the wall peering out
return to your position mr
maybe theyre not through you heard me mr
i dont think therell be any more
reluctantly grey goes back to mid car
its not too bad i think it went right through
blue spots something bends and picks up a lump of metal which he tosses to brown who watches it in his bloodied left hand glances at it then throws it
how does it feel
okay i never feel pain too much
how many shots were there
just one the rest was me
i didnt see anything i guess i just got mad no sense to it somebody got nervc
us or bored theyve been out there a long time
we cant let it pass
im not mad any more forget it
we cant afford to
looking around at the passengers ill go pick one cut
his back to the pillar he has his radio up to his face whispering into it
i dont know who did it lieutenant it came from behind me somewhere in the dark
it hadda be one of them snipers they got down here acting on whose orders
i dont know maybe nobodys
you mean somebody just took it into his head to fire
on his own
how could he do such a thing
easy real easy
can you see whats going on inside the train
not too good
what do you think theyll do
i dont know but id sure hate to be in there finding out
camera panning the passengers sitting on one side of the car the passengers staring back at camera blue then we cross the aisle and pan back up the other side
stand up please
as they turn to look at whomever blue has indicated
the conductor as he looks up and touches his
chest with a finger
you mean me
thats right conductor
would you come along with me please
what are you going to do
theres something you can help us with
bud still hesitates
dont worry conductor come he leads bud by the arm back to the rear of the car every passen gars eye on the conductor as he passes his free hand
moving from overhead strap to strap
all you have to do is walk uptrack about a hundred feet and wait for the men delivering the money
they have reached the rear where bud manages to avoid looking at brown while blue slides open the door
ill help you down onto the track
why do i have to go
i told you theres nothing to worry about
now please go
bud looks at him then accepts blues offer of help as he starts to swing down onto the roadbed
still face down behind the canvas sack
now okeefe raises his head
look somebodys being helped down onto the track christ hes coming this way hes headed straight for us
as the conductor heads for camera
he hesitates turns back to the subway car behind him then continues walking
suddenly brown looms in the doorway his submachine gun poised and now fires a short burst the muzzle flashing
as he staggers reaches upward then crumples as he passes camera falling forward camera following him down
one of his outstretched hands comes to res near a pillar and a black shoe
camera then pans up to james terrified face
prescott on the radio
what the hell are you talking about sol
how do you know they shot a hostage
because one of our own cops is right there
the body almost landed on him for chris sake

miskowsky and okeefe regard one another then get slowly to their feet and brush themselves off
ill never get this crap off
one of these days they oughta clean up this subway
he switches on his flashlight
brown at the rear door watching the track
now he turns and calls
blue theres the light
blue returns to the rear and stands watching with brown
as they proceed miskowsky sweeping the light from side to side and okeefe carrying the sack
now miskowskys light
picks out buds dead body on the track and then caz dolowitz
it looks like vietnam down here
they continue toward the first car
blue now opens the rear door as the flashlights beam sweeps across the back end of the car
now miskowsky and okeefe appear only their faces peering into the car
okeefe tosses the sack off his shoulder onto the cars floor and it lands with a thud
miskowsky and oi eefe look up at blue and brown who merely stare back
no one speaks
then the two policemen turn and go
blue now busies himself with opening the neck of the sack then lifting the other end so that the bricks of money spill out onto the floor in a heap
in rapid succession blue brown grey and green their eyes glued on the money and then various passengers the pimp the hooker the old dian the drama critic the hippie
the puerto rican the fag
grey he gestures for grey to join them which he does his eyes on the money all the time
well will you look at that get your things off both of you and start loading up
blue watches while both grey and brown remove their raincoats jackets and finally their shirts
brown has a blood stained kerchief tied around his right upper arm
both wear what can only be called money vests canvas sleeveless fitting over the head like a mae west with ties on the sides and containing pockets in all front
grey you do mr
brown then hell do you nineteen packets each
blue continues to observe for a mc ment as grey starts inserting packets of pills one to a pocket into browns vest as brown stands stiffly his hands at his
then blue walks to the front end of the car joining green
all that money i cant believe when theyre finished itll be your turn
grey will load you up
but dont go down there until nr
brown has come here to take your place
ill load up as soon as i talk to prescott
i just wish it was all over already
pretty soon now
he goes into the motormans cab and shuts the door
prescott at his desk waiting
then this is pelham one two three do you read me prescott
punching a button this is prescott im going to give you five specific instructions
each one i
to be followed precisely is that clear
one at the end of this conversation you will restore power to the entire sector
restore power twos you will clear the local track all the way from th street to south ferry
by clear i mean switches properly set and all signals green
i emphasize green prescott if eve so much as see a red light let alone get tripped by one we will shoot a hostage
local track cleared to south ferry and all signals green three
all southbound trains behind us local and express are to remain lying dead
likewise all northbound between south ferry and here
got it four you will con act me as soon as the track is clear and all signals are green
go ahead five you will remove all police personnel from the tunnel
if we see a single cop between here and south ferry we will shoot a hostage
in fact any deviation from these instructions and we will shoot a hostage
are you aware that youre insane
after a pause let me know when all five points have been complied with
over and out
prescott sits back for a moment thinking
then he punches a button
sol you there
im here clive whats up
hold on while i cut in the city punches a button daniels
this is prescott come in prescott this is daniels daniels ive got lieutenant garber of the transit police on the line with us
i have the latest instructions from the hijackeraa

what do you think theyve got in mind
dont all talk at once
intercut a prescott garber daniels beats hell out of me clive
i wouldntve picked a tunnel to make my getaway from in the first place
but they did pick it and since everything theyve done so far has
been organized down to tha smallest detail it stands to reason theyve got the rest worked out too
power restored and the track cleared so theyre gonna move their car obviously
but why south ferry
if i remember right it comes after bowling green what comes after south ferry
bowling green again the track loops around and heads back uptown
all theyll do is bottle themselves up
thats no good
so that means they want south ferry
do you think its the water sol
maybe theyve got a boat waiting in the harbor dr a seaplane who knows
better play it a step at a time
clive you see about restoring power and clearing the track
daniels and ill start pulling our units out of the tunnel
we can follow them just as well up above on the street

he disconnects then rises and crosses to frank correll whos still frantically leafing through teletype dispatches and shouting into a phone
what do you want me to do for chrissake
the goddam powers still off

he slams the receiver down then notices prescott looking down at him
whats going on prescott do i get my trains back now or dont i

do you realize that in less than an hour the goddam rush hour starts
will you shut up and listen
ive got a new set of instructions

prescott reaches into his pocket removes his service revolver and grabbing correll by the chin pushes his head back and places the muzzle of the gun into his eye
if you dont do what i tell you frank youll be having dinner tonight with caz dolowitz
it stands as before
in the semi darkness
then suddenly the lights in the tunnel and inside the car flash on the power has been restored
the time is superimposed all lights are on and the passengers react to the sudden brightness
brown fully dressed again but looking even bulkier with the addition of the money stands at the front end of the car now
is at mid car also dressed again
blue and green are at the rear end the latter having just finished filling the formers money vest and now helps him on with his jacket and raincoat
blue moves to the center of the car
your attention please in a moment were going to start moving again
you will all remain seated and quiet
we expect to release you unharmed in a short while but until then you must continue doing exactly as youre told

he heads for the motormans cab green right behind him
the pimp looks at grey for a moment

blue stands to one side as green sets up at the controls and checks the track ahead
green all the way down

green edges the controller forward and the car responds
as the car starts to move
as the red slashes representing pelham one two three are moving
featuring marino who is staring up at the board

jesus look at em hanging over the edge
when i was a motorman i had nightmares about them falling off in front of me
as the lone car passes slowly through
the long stranded would be riders start to shout whistle and bang on the windows and side of the
slowly passing car
terrified passengers and the uncertain brown and grey as the car runs the gauntlet of the irate crowd outside they all shy from the poundi ng fists
the red lights moving past rd street
camera whip pans to mrs
jenkins on t e radio
pelham one two three passing rd street station
a police squad car inches along crossing rd street heading downtosm
daniels and a uniformed police driver
continuing slow at around five miles per hour what they call the switching position
go ahead daniels
i just had a terrible thought what if theyre not on the train
what if they set the throttle and jumped off
while were chasing the train theyre sneaking out an emergency exit somewhere behind us
ingenious except for one thing its impossible
little gizmo called the dead mans feature
it was built into the controller handle in case a motorman should ever drop dead
it has to have a mans hand pressing down on it at all times in order to work
otherwise the train stops cold
nice try though
but in case
radio prescoti contd youre still worried i was just about to call them
ill let you know if i get their answering service
greens hand pressed down on it
command center calling pelham one two three camera pulls back to include green and blue
this is pelham
whats going on
the track isnt clear to south ferry yet how come youre moving
slight change of plan
we decided to put some distance between us and all those cops you had hidden in the tunnel back there
if you keep moving youre gonna start running into red signals
i dont want you to blame us for it
well be stopping soon
just get back when youve cleared the rest of the track
do you think hes figured anything out
all those questions perfectly natural under the circumstances
theyre thinking just the way we want them to
closed down for some years the station platform is no more brightly lit than the rest of the tunnel giving it an eerie look
the first car of pelham one two three rolls slowly through
look sharp now its coming blue and green are straining their eyes against the darkened tunnel ahead
do you see it
its that white light about a hundred feet ahead
all right this is close enough
green starts to apply the brake
the red lights representing pelham one two three stop
camera pulls back to include marino mrs
jenkins and some of the towermen all watching the board
shes shut down again

coiitiand center pre scott day goddarani

he sits back and thinks for a moment
then he turns to correll
frank how long before youre clear all the way to south ferry
you mean before this railroad is so totally fucked up that itll take a goddam computer to put it back together

five or six minutes

come on up here and take over on the radio but dont tell em the tracks clear until i check in with you
i dont want them starting up again before i get there
subway first car ihiotorf ian s cab as it is pulled from the valpac a cast iron shoe like
form with a molded hollowed out area on one side
it is clearly heavy enough to require both of greens hands to heft it
caitie a pulls back to reveal him grunting setting it over the controller handle which it fits perfectly
blue stands by watching
blue now hands him a length of pipe some six inches in length
green takes it fits one end into a socket on top of the gimmick facing toward the windshield and screws it in
then blue hands him his submachine gun
green looks at him for reassurance
green attacks the windshield with tine stock of the gun opening a great splintered hole
as the passengers react to the sounds of breaking
glass coming from within the i iotormans cab
the front window is almost completely out only a few pieces of glass cling to the frame
get it all its got to look right
green uses the guns barrel to scrape around the edges clearing away the last traces of glass
blue now hands green another length of pipe this one about three feet long
green fits one end over the protruding end of the attached short pipe not screwing it merely fitting it
the other end extends straight out the glassless windshield
it once make sure it comes away clean
green yanks at the long pipe and it separates from the shorter one
he reattaches it
now j um down ill hand the other oiece through
green leaves the cab
brown standing guard as green comes out of the cab
the two men exchange glances but no words as green opens the storm door stepping out
as green jumps onto the roadbed and comes around in front of the car his shoes crunching the broken glass
lbove from the cab blue hands green down still a third pipe this one the same length three feet as the second
green now screws one end of the third to the protruding end of the second but at such an angle that the construction now turns sharply left extending toward the
tunnel wall beyond the side line of the train
make sure its tight
come on back in
green returns to the storm door c there brown extends his left hand and pulls green back up into the car
blue is inspecting
the placement of the gimmick over the controller as green enters
its all set to go
i only wish we were
dont worry ten minutes from now well be free and clear
union square park
a police squad car sits at the curb
the time is superiiiposed
daniels on the radio

as daniels hangs up the mike the rear door opens and prescott sticks his head inside
who the hell are you
i thought i dont know what i thought
prescott climbs into the back and closes the door
theyre still down there
if the street collapsed wed probably land right on top of them
grabbing the mike prescott to command center garber

as it pulls away from the curb
blue and green
command center to pelham one two three come in pelham thats not prescott this is pelham what happened to prescott
even stars have to pee
just letting you know the tracks clear all the way to south ferry
thanks command center

you can do it youraelf at the arraignment
over and out
he gives the mike a strong tug and snaps the wire
i want this train moving in thirty seconds
brown and mr
rcan cut the emergency brake cords
green leaves the cab
blue examines the gimmick one last time then follows green out
as the rope with the red wooden handle which dangles some six inches from a hole in the ceiling of the car is cut by a pair of clippers inserted
into the hole
camera pulls back to include brown standing on a seat behind the motormans cab
including grey who is cutting the brake cord at the other end of the car
now submachine gun in hand brown opens the front storm door crouches and drops out of sight
then grey starts for the rear door hesitates returns to the hooker and bends to whisper something in her ear
you and what army
snickering he returns to the rear door opens it and disappears
at the front of
the car green backs out of the door closing it after him and is helped down to the roadbed by brown from below
only blue is left
he holds his submachine gun easily cradled in one arm as he moves through the car
you will remain in your seats
dont try to get up
you mean ever
i mean remain seated
he has reached the rear walking backwards and now gropes behind him for the door handle
arent you going to tell us what a great bunch of hostages weve been
blue doesnt answer as he opens the door and backs out onto the metal landing
then he closes the door and drops down to the track
the passengers left alone look at one another uncertainly
the four hijackers are deployed along the side of the car green in front with brown blue in back with grey
all right mr
green green a hand on the protruding pipe connected to the controller handle inside the motormans cab now grabs it with both hands and pushes inward toward the train
as it is moved clockwise through switching into the series position
the train starts to move
as it does green tugs sharply back on the pipe and the two longer sections angled together disengage and come loose in his hand
he starts to lose his balance but brawn grabs him and pulls him back to the tunnel wall
the train it picking up speed rapidly as it slides by them
as it accelerates
the passengers continue looking around not sure whats happening
suddenly without warning the hippie jumps to his feet and running in a crouch toward the rear of the car draws a revolver
they said to remain seated i im a police officer
he slides open the rear door of the now rapidly moving car and dives out leaving the passengers even more confused
as the car rattles away and he lands hard rolling over perhaps hitting a pillar dropping his gun and sustaining arm and head lacerations
he lies face upwards semi conscious fairly bloody
as they group
lets move along gentlemen theres no time to waste
you all remember the drill
whats wrong mr
i thought i saw something fall out the back of the train
what did it look like
i dont know a shadow couldve been a person im not a hundred percent sure i saw it
hefting his gun want me to go check
peering aid thinking forget it theres no time
the red blips are moving
jenkins voice grand central toner to cozna
nd center pelham one two three in motion prescott still in the back seat daniels up front with the driver
passing th st
station and running
speed approaching miles per hour
were right on top of her
it doesnt make any sense they know were monitoring their position that weve got to be following so
so its dumb
whoever said crooks were smart
but these have been up to now that is
they havent made a single mistake
i tell you were over blue green brown and grey have moved to the door leading to the exit chamber under a grating in the street above beneath the bare
all right we do it exactly as we did in the drill by the numbers
drills numbers its all chicken shit
why dont we just do it
shut up and do what youre told
they set them down on the roadbed
hats glasses wigs and mustaches they remove their disguises anal we see their faces for the first time
as it bumps and rattles along
the passengers have remained seated
can you imagine
that beatnik being a policeman
hippie they dont call them beatniks any more
they dont call them hippies any more either
how can they let policemen dress like that
thats his job hes in cognito
hes also dead most likely
we were moving pretty fast by the time he jumped o t
theyre trained to do that
jump headfirst off a subway
where do you think theyre taking us now
dont worry theyll let us go pretty soon
the hooker has been looking around with growing anxiety and now she stands up
you dumb bastards cant anybody count
they all four got off
theres nobody driving the fucking train
theres a moments silence as everyone digests this news
then the mother screams
as the lone car hurtles through the station
he raises himself on one elbow and shakes his head
he wipes some blood off his face and looks at his fingers
remove your coats turn inside out and put back on
he looks off
as blue green brown and grey take off their coats and begin turning them inside out illuminated by the over head bulb
he blink still in a foa
he lcoks at his empty hand for
a moment trying to remember what should still be in it but isnt
then he begins groping around on the ground and whispering to himself barely audibly
gun gotta find my gun as they are putting their coats on again
greys is now a light beige poplin browns a mediumn grey with fur collar greens a tan herringbone weed blues a salt and pepper donegal
they remove new hats from their coat pockets greys a powder blue low crowned golfing hat browns a grey with short upturned brim greens a grey russian astrakhan blues a
brown cap with short visor
remove gloves as the squad car goes through siren screaming
pelham one two three reported halfway between astor place and bleeker speed increasing christ theyre gaining on us
it has something co do with that short move they surprised us with from th to th st
their scheme its tied up some how with that move it has to bet but whyd they do it
i give up
to get away from the cops in the tunnel thats what they said all right why not
suppose they were doing something they didnt want anybody to see
softly and evenly like getting off the train
daniels turn around were going back
like hell we are
theyre not on the train im sure of it
look presoctt im the one who suggested that in the first place but you shot me down something about a dead mans feature they figured out how to beat it
thats their aanl thats what they started with
daniels considers for an instant then turns to the driver
turn it around and burn rubber
as it pulls a u turn in the middle of the block broadway tires squealing barely avoiding a bus
the time is
blue green brown and grey
check handguns in coat pocket they each remove a snub nosed pistol check it then return it
remove magazines from submachine guns
all of them pick up their submachine guns but only three remove the magazines and then place the guns back dcwn again
grey merely watches the other three
continuing to hold his gun under his arm a slight smile on his face
did you hear me mr
disarm your gun and put it down so we can i get out of here
im not leaving it it goes out with me
put it down mr
grey what if somethings gone wrong
what if theyre waiting for us up there
i want moren just a dinky pea shooter
nothings gone wrong
the plan depends on our walking away un noticed
you cant do that carry ing a submachine gun
i wont just carry it ill hold it under my coat this is crazy
do what he says so we can get going
youre leaving your gun here mr
in a pigs ass mr
blue without any warning blue whose wright hand has been in his pocket fires his pistol through his coat catching f grey full in the chest
he staggers back bumps against the tunnel wall and collapses landing on his side
blue bends pries the submachine gun loose from greys death grip removes the magazine pockets it and tosses the gun away
green has watched all this in near panic
oh my god brown watches with a detachment bordering on disinterest
i what about his money vest
green will put it on over his own
youre the thinnest one itll show less
hurry up and undress
brown help me with mr
they start to work on the dead body as green starts undressing
the red lights progressing
ca era pulls back
shes passing canal st
doing around fifty miles per
thats a pretty good clip i hope they know what theyre doing
only four more stations to south ferry
as the single car roars through the station the darkened front window divulges nothing
some of the passengers have gone to the front of the car
is trying to open the door to the motormans cab but theres no outside handle so all he can do is pound impotently against it
the mother remains in her seat holding her two boys pressed against her
now the old man starts pushing his way up front
my friends please the situa tion isnt as lousy as it looks just a little lousys good enough for me
i never knew these things went so fast
were going to be killedl no no we wont
i admit that right now were on a run away train but its only temporary the car careens into a curve and sways wildly as the metal wheels scrape and
theres a good deal of scream ing and shouting from the passengers as several fall down
the old man starts to topple but the pimp steadies him
thank you brother
ahelluva lot you know but i do know ive been riding the subways for over sixty years im an expert
why dont we cut all this crap and beat down that goddam door for it isnt necessary
they got something called stoppers or trippers or stickers or something old man contd like that so whenever a train goes through a red light these things automatically stop it
looking cut the theres jest one thing baby whats that
they all green
shooting straight ahead from the front of the train
nothing but green lights ahead as the train races along
propped up now against a pillar straining to look at something off
blue and brown are tying the second money vest on green then help him on with his shirt nd coat
he returns his attention to the business of locating his gun
he scrapes the heel of an extended leg to his extreme discomfort along the ground hoping to discover it and does
seeing it he now goes through the painful exercise of reaching for it finally managing this too
now lifting one knee as a gun mount he holds the revolver in both hands and starts to take aim
with the gun in the foreground its sight being shifted as the three men are preparing to leave through the emergency exit
now the hippies vision focus blurs for a moment and when it clears green has already disappeared through the door and brown is right behind him
the gunsight centers on browns broad back and the gun fires
brown convulses and topples backwards
the squad car racing uptown now
youd better be right about this even if i am were probably gonna be too late
blue stands behind a pillar his gun in hand peering into the darkness trying to locate the marksman
green is in the well of the emergency exit beside the metal ladder that leads up through a grate and out onto the street
between them before the open doorway to the well browns body lies face up on the ground
green now gestures for blue to come across the open area separating then
come on i id never make it i it came from down there someplace ive got to
go on green hesitates looks up the ladder looks back at blue
i ill wait for you blue looks at him fora moment then checks his pistol and slowly steps out from behind the pillar
a shot rings out immediately and the ricochet off the pillar zings loudly
blue calmly fires twice at the muzzle flash
both shots have connected one hitting his arm and sending the pistol flying away the other into his upper chest below the right shoulder
he topples over sprawling across one rail onto the roadbed
he has stepped back behind his pillar again to listen
did you hit him
he listens again then leaves his pillar and hurries downtrack to the next where he again waits and listens inadvertently he groans
he has heard
now he steps out from behind the pillar and starts forward to the next a little more secure
as the single car flashes through the station
as before shooting straight ahead from the front of the train
still nothing but green lights
most of the passengers are now packed at the front of the car staring out at the track ahead
where are the goddam red lights
there arent any
were not stopping were going to be killed
i old man theres gonna be a red light there has to be
and what if there isnt
there has to be
now he can see the hippie lying across the track ahead
he slowly starts toward him calm his pistol at his side
its all right
go on up ill be right with you
as he climbs up the ladder and starts pushing up the grating above his head
barely conscioous unable to move he watches blue approach
as he continues walking unhurried toward the hippie
finally he arrives stops looks down at the injured man
you were on the train
are you a cop
almost imperceptibly the hippie nods just once
then the mayor will come to your funeral
x he lifts his gun to aim and fire and the hippie manages to turn his head away
then theres a shot and blue crumples to the ground dead
as prescott comes up and stands looking down at blues body
then he turns his attention to the hippie bending beside him
all he can see is the long blond hair
ill have an ambr lance here in no time at all miss every things going to be all right
identifying the stop south ferry
camera ti hip pans to the track as the lone car of pelham one two three roars in and speed undiminished roars out
the old man is sitting now his head in his hands
the hooker the pimp and one or two others are still jammed up against the window
my god look
a sharp curve ahead
were going too fast to make it i the train rushes into the curve and then as the wheels start to screech a red signal comes into view and camera
zooms in on it
look i its red
if possible showing the trippers working on the car to stop it
with a hissing sound and as everyone is thrown forward the car decelerates quickly and finally stops and there is complete silence
the puerto rican crossing himself
the mother hugging her two sons to her weeping
the pimp sitting his head back staring at the ceiling
a cigarette with trembling
he slowly looks up then around finally at the hooker and he smiles
i told you it would stop didnt i
you win pop
she opens her rheumy eyes for the first time
forty secon stree awready
travelling with prescott as he walks and surveys the scene several squad cars standing at the curb their red lights flashing and revolving and now an ambulance siren wailing pulling
a couple of cops help the attendants with their wheeled stretcher and hurry off with it
prescott heads for one of the squad cars and the time is superimposed he arrives at the car and leans in to talk to daniels
what about the train
stopped itself just past south ferry
thats a break
so whats the score
on our side two dead and a long haired cop on the critical list
and dont forget
him he indicates the back seat with his thumb
camera pans to pick up green sitting sadly staring at nothing in particular
at his desk operating furiously on the phone the radio with dispatches his sweat soaked shirt clinging to him
maintenance you got those trippers reset yet
about fucking time
tower the south ferry loops open again repeat south ferry loop open opera ons this is my last warning if all your cops arent out of the tunnel at th
in thirty seconds im gonna run em down what
well why the hell didnt you say so
to all motormen to all motormen resume normal routes and schedules effective immedi ately
he shuts off all his lines and sits back looking around
his relief man is standing by
okay augie im givin you back your railroad full ser vice restored try and keep it that way will you
he rises wearily takes his coat off the back of his chair and relief man great job frank great job
correll nods and starts out
y its gonna be pretty dull around here tomorrow frank whatre you gonna do for an encore
bring charges against that nigger cop
he waves and starts off across the large room
the others watch him go
with that mouth he eats
the time is superimposed
then coming into focus a group of men the mayor the commissioner warren lasalle and a doctor are standing looking down at the hippie camera lying in bed
i believe hes awake now including the hippie in bed and a news camerman standing by
the mayor is wrapped
in a heavy overcoat a woolen muffler and a fur hat with ear muffs
congratulations patrolman berry robert g
patrolman berry all right if i call you bob
you performed an act of extraordinary valor bob the people of the city of new york are in your debt
shake his hand nate the mayor reaches out to shake hands but the hippie is too weak to lift his so the mayor picks it up from atop the covers
and pumps it
a flashbulb pops from the photo graphers camera
then the mayor sneezes again
splendid work berry the de partments very proud of you
ive already put you in for pro motion
thank you sir i only did what any other man on the force wouldve so long now bob hurry up and get well will you fella
and congratulations again
thank you sir i only did what any other man on the force but theyre already moving toward the door
he looks better than i do probably feels better too
the hippies eyes slowly close as he goes back to sleep
the time is superimposed
as prescott comes down the front steps alone wearing a raincoat against the nights chill
he starts off down the street
most of the stores closed their iron grills drawn as pres cott walks along
he stops at a corner newsstand thats just being boarded up by an old woman
he spots the daily news headline i
and buys one
know whats gonna go next
the empire state building
i wouldnt be surprised
he starts off down the street again having folded back the front page and
now reading the third page
suddenly he crumples the paper into a ball between his two hands fakes dribbling it along the sidewalk makes a good move fakes one man spins away from another and
hooking a high arching shot at a wire mesh trash basket watches it hit the rim and bounce away onto the pavement
he keeps on walking as the time is superimposed
