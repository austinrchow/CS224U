a screenplay by paul mayersberg shooting script a roulette table
the punters place their bets
twelve players nine men three women
the faces of the men all ages intense hopeful fearful
which of them is jack
now he had become the still centre of that spinning wheel of misfortune
a mans hand spins the wheel
the ball is thrown against the spin
hands faces chips
the world turned round him
leaving him miraculously untouched the little white ball circles the spinning wheel
the punterss faces as the ball starts to bounce
all eyes are on the bouncing ball
the croupier had reached his goal
he no longer heard the sound of the ball
the back of the croupiers hand his slicked back short hair razor cut
the camera moves around to his face
to begin with he was jack manfred
whistling sound takes jack back in time
jack is walking through a maze of open plan partitioned offices
he ls casually but fashionably dressed hair dyed blond long a nervous elegance about him almost unrecognisable from the croupiers face
he searches for the right office
he finds it
the name on the open is giles cremorne
giles cremorne a public schoolboy in his late twenties comes forward and vigorously shakes jacks hand
jacketless he wears yellow braces
next to his tidy desk is a slot machine
take a pew jack
you look well
whats it been two years since we broke bread
giles has an upper class accent but an acquired street manner
three years two months
what a memory youve got
maths always was your strong suit
what happened to the moaning lisa
she went back to south africa
digging did she
smiles you were pretty thick at one time
we all played the field
giles frowns at a memory an implication
giless mobile phone buzzes
he picks up
ill call you back
to jack now then
suddenly i want a job giles
cautiously all right
i was thinking perhaps i could be a reader
you employ readers dont you
for unsolicited manuscripts
we pay twenty pounds a manuscript
you might get two maybe three in a week
can you live on sixty pounds
jack opens a pack of gitanes
this is a no smoking office jack
youve written a book havent you
i didnt read it myself but a woman secretary puts her head into the office
give me ten minutes fiona
fiona puts a fax on giless desk smiles at jack and goes
fiona used to read for me
he winks at jack
let me tell you about our operation
we like personality authors
people the public recognises
celebritys what sells books
we can always find someone to do the writing
first we need the face
then the concept
he is reading the fax right now im looking for a soccer novel
something where a tycoon buys a lousy team and takes it to the top
seven figure transfer fees
corruption all down the line
violence on and off the pitch
got any concepts
it could be a thug story
i tell you what
why dont you think about it
a couple of pages
got any concepts
it could be a thug story
i tell you what
why dont you think about it
a couple of pages
smiles with plenty of sex of course
giles pops a coin into the slot machine pulls the handle waits
i will think about it
the machine spits out several coins
giles takes them
let me give you three words of advice jack
dont give up
stick with it
who persists wins
thats my motto
write write write
jack nods extends his hand
a firm handshake
jack had three words for giles
go fuck yourself
giles smiles goodbye pockets his slot machine winnings
the untidy evidence
to the accompaniment of the music a discordant version three dog eared copies of the invention of the wheel a novel by jack manfred
a pile of literary magazines
two elegantly arranged vases of flowers
womens fashion magazines
books everywhere including scarne on gambling the education of a poker player delta of venus and other books by anais nin
a womans dress back from the cleaners
a framed etching of cape town south africa in the eighteenth century
beneath the iron barred window with a view of the iron steps down from the street jack sits at the dining table
in front of him is a word processor
he toys with a glass of vodka smoking a gitane and leafing through a soccer fan magazine
he starts to touch type looking at the screen not the keyboard
words appear letter by letter
by jack manfred
he pauses to drink
a man face unseen steps into a phone booth
close on his hands
it is impossible to tell where he is
he opens his pocket book addresses diary etc
and searches through for something
he finds what hes looking for a small photograph among others of girls of a ten year old boy in school uniform
on the back are three phone numbers two of them crossed out
the man lifts the receiver inserts coins
he starts to press the numbers
there are close ups of his finger pressing the sequence of digits each one closer longer than the one before until
the phone rings
jack looks to the answering machine waits for the voice
jacko if youre there pick up
i want to talk to you
jack hesitates then picks up
dad im here
the man is handsome tanned ish white shirt dark tie
he is jacks father
hows it going
the subsequent conversation is intercut between sitting room and phone booth
found a job
well ive got something for you
in london i mean
ive been chatting to some friends
do you know the golden lion casino
its in bayswater i believe
theyre looking for a dealer a croupier
jack sr pulls out a cigarette a gitanes
thats not what i want to do dad
jack stubs his cigarette out
lighting his cigarette dont be stubborn
the pay wont be grand but its regular
thats what you need isnt it
i know you dont like taking my advice
drinks its not that
ive set this up for you
call the golden lion and ask for mr reynolds hes the manager
i dont know him personally but ive spoken to his boss
dont say no jacko
give yourself a break
jack reaches for a cigarette
all right ill think about it
just do it
youve got the knack youve got the personality you got that from me
jack lights up
you understand the punters
think about it you can write during the day and sleep knowing the bills are paid
as he speaks he watches passing women
for christs sake jacko dont look a gift horse in the mouth
have you written that name down
reynolds at the golden lion
exhales exhales all right dad
yes ill call him
jack is not enthusiastic but he scribbles the name down on a pad
so how are you doing dad
ive just started a new company
pause i love you jacko you know that yes i know that
dont let yourself down
jack hangs up
stubbing out his cigarette jack sr
leaves the booth
we now see where he is
a beach bar in south africa
he walks to the bar and
goes behind it slipping on his barmans jacket
a woman in dark mirror glasses and a bathing suit is waiting
smiles sorry to keep you
whatll you have
jack disturbed by the call pours himself a vodka
he looks at what hes written the ball
a novel by
jack knew something was wrong
hed forgotten giles advice
giles said three words
jack inserts a word in the title
it now reads on the ball
after a moment
jacks voice no
jack knew it still wasnt quite right
he types in the balls
then on reflection deletes in the
through the iron bars jack watches feet pass on the street above
a drunk drops a beer can over
the can falls in slow motion but the clatter is loud
i want to fuck the whole world over
the camera turns around the fake glitz of the interior brass drapes polished wood mirrors and moves towards the front door
welcome back jack
to the house of addiction
the door opens
against a blaze of street daylight jacks silhouette appears
the camera moves forward to greet him
jack removes his wristwatch
jack shakes hands with david reynolds a cold man in his late forties dead behind the eyes
david reynolds im the manager here
sit down john
reynolds examines a file in front of him
youve been recommended by the management here
they know your father
he has a bit of a reputation hasnt he
frowns has he
in any case i understand youve had some previous experience
in south africa
jack nods youll find the rules a little different here
before we start you havent got a police record have you
reynolds opens the door
he lets jack go on ahead
where did you go to school
surpised i was at beadles
i dont think i know that one
private i suppose
the full overhead lights give the casino an exposed tacky appearance devoid of mystery or glamour
the place has roulette tables and blackjack counters
it is deserted except for several cleaning ladies vacuuming emptying ashtrays
reynolds walks with jack talking
there are three types of casino in the u
thats middle of the road
do you have a salon prive
but there wasnt enough business
the punters like company
reynolds goes to one of the tables with jack
lets see you handle the chips
he slides open a box and tips chips of varying denominations onto the table
i have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond
we check every four days
and not three or five
shrugs its the procedure here
now sort the chips
jack starts to stack the chips in piles from a hundred pounds to five
jacks fingers work fast
in a matter of moments he has the lot stacked
pounds or pence in fours
he presses a stopwatch in his hand
jack quickly sets out four neat piles three of one of
all four piles are in denominations of ten and five
now take these colours
he throws a pile of blue and white chips on the table
the blue are the white are
i want but i want in denominations of
jack nods and gets to work
his fingers make reynoldss ticking watch seem slow
impressed very good
now at a roulette table reynolds has prepared the bets for fifteen punters
its a set up to test jacks style and concentration
reynolds gives jack the white ball
you use two alternating dont you
hands him a second ball hesitates wheres the magnet
theyve been tested
jack spins the wheel throws the ball against the turn
no more bets
as the ball begins to bounce but before it stops reynolds turns to a cleaning lady whos emptying some ashtrays nearby
could you stop that for a minute
the woman looks up surprised
jack watches then catches sight of reynolds surreptitiously moving a chip onto the third line
im sorry sir ive called no more bets
jack reaches across takes the chip and puts it on the wood grounding the wheel
reynolds nods approvingly
the ball stops
he now rakes away the losers chips and pays out the smallest first before getting to the major pay out on
its all very efficient and speedy
reynolds is increasingly impressed
havent you forgotten something
thinks i dont think so
wipe your hands
jack takes out a handkerchief
not with your own cloth
besides your pockets will be stitched
what happens if i want to sneeze
not without permission
they like each other
now lets move on
a blackjack table
jack is turning cards over for five punters in an arc
reynolds is moving from one chair to the next playing each of the five hands
how many aces are left
i make it six
reynolds looks down at the table
what makes you so sure
its a rule
always stand by your first count
the odds are youre right
jack pulls out the shoe
you want me to check
irritably i said good call
reynolds walks away
jack puts the shoe back
he takes his watch out of his pocket glances at it
it had taken him minutes but jack now had mr reynoldss number
the man couldnt count
back in the office reynolds is talking to jack
on reynoldss desk is a framed photograph of his suburban wife and two kids
let me just run through a few things
as a dealer you never gamble not anywhere
well need your picture
for the database
it can be accessed by every casino in the country
we have the same system for punters
i dont gamble
i dont gamble mr reynolds
reynolds doesnt pursue it
friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged
relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden
we had the same rule at sun city but it was impossible to check
this isnt south africa
wed know because someone would report it
believe me someone always does
or does report
what would happen if i knew something like that and didnt report it
there are no secrets in this casino
youd be punished
first offence verbal warning
second offence written warning
that ones filed and sometimes copied to the gaming board
third offence youre sacked on the spot
youd never work in a casino in this country again
theres another rule youre forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino
if you see someone whos gambled here even if its just casually on the street you must ignore him
youre not married are you
jack shakes his head girlfriend
shes not in the gaming business is she
a cctv centre over the casino
jack crosses the room looking down through a glass floor at the empty casino below
reynolds walks over to a series of twenty or more banked tv monitors with many video tape decks
this is our crows nest
im showing it to you now but youll never see it again
we have tapes in here that go back six months
let me show you something
reynolds presses a button
together they look at a tv monitor which shows an overlook of a roulette table where a woman is cheating
reynolds freezes the frame
that was six weeks ago
the dealer missed it
the guy up here missed it but i watch these tapes after hours
nothing gets by me
now the ladys in jail
its easier to take ten million pounds from a bank than take one penny from this casino
again in the office
reynolds extends his hand
jack shakes it
you can start monday week
that hair will have to go
are you planning to make a career in casino work
and end up like you
i just want the job
jack youre not the usual type we get here
mr reynolds was right
it was true
jack was up above the world
an artist living in the clouds
a high angled shot of the office jack and reynolds
the phone rings
reynolds picks up and listens
the camera descends
i cant talk about this now
no im with somebody
they can wait
ill be home at the usual time
all right ill call you back in an hour
hangs up dont ever get married jack
casino work doesnt mix with house and garden
the camera reaches a low angle on jack looking up
whats the salary
the street lamps have come on
jack is at the wheel of a sixties austin healey
the casino paid its staff monthly in arrears
he would have to wait six weeks for his first cheque
he needed money now
under a canopy of coloured lights a car dealer is walking round jacks car examining it
fake american accent what kind of deal you looking to
whats the blue book price
thats not relevant
an old car like this it depends on the condition
the car was a gift from jacks father
thats to say jack senior had given it to him before the bailiffs arrived
the dealer picks at the cracked leather seats the protruding stuffing the chipped dashboard the rust
this aint exactly what youd call mint
he bends down and looks underneath the car
how about fifteen hundred
how about five hundred
how about we split the diff
is that your idea of arithmetic
im not a mathematician
im in business
the dealer looks at jack
jack stares back
its as if one is waiting for the other to blink first
he suddenly wanted to be rid of it
hang on tightly let go lightly
it was a saying jack remembered
jack leans into the open car and takes out his hat and cigarettes
he has accepted the offer
the music begins
jack stands with an unlit cigarette in a crowded moving train
he looks at the faces men and women
he sees people reading books
he looks at the titles romantic fiction classics business management thrillers self help cooking
jack imagined people reading his book
one day he would enter their heads play with their imaginations test their feelings
jack crosses the road
he turns down a side street where victorian houses have been converted into flats
there are scores of for sale and to let signs down the street
he would tell them you have to make a choice in life
be a gambler or a croupier
and then live with your decision come what may
he goes down into a basement closing the iron gate behind him
jack unlocks the door goes in to the accompaniment of street sounds and a dog barking
marion saw life differently
she was a romantic
and thought he was too
radio music is playing from another room
an orchestral version of try a little tenderness
jack comes in hangs his hat up looks around
he sees a neatly arranged vase of flowers that wasnt there before
he goes to the bedroom
jack sees on the bed an open box and a carrier bag from a designer department store
among the white tissue paper is a simple black silk dress and lace decorated black underwear
he smiles and picks up the knickers
he goes to the open bathroom door from which comes the music
a radio plays beside the bath
the water is draining away
marion neil a red haired woman in her mid thirties wearing a bathrobe with the name marion on it is examining the lines on her neck in the half steamed
she sees jack turns with a smile
jack holds up the black knickers
i couldnt resist them
you mean i wont resist them
jack goes to her
im not ready for you
theres some vodka in the freezer
you want me drunk
laughs i wont be that long
she pushes him gently with the flat of her palms towards the door
jack comes back into the bedroom
marion pushes the bathroom door not quite closed
jack tosses the knickers onto the bed
jack takes the vodka bottle out of the freezer pours himself a glass
he sees two bottles of wine opened food neatly prepared ready to cook an open cook book
he pours a glass of wine
jack sits drinking his vodka
looking up through the barred window he sees womens legs passing on the street above
on the desk beside the computer is the glass of wine
marion materialises in the door to the bedroom
she is made up wearing the black dress and high heeled black shoes a black scarf around her neck
jack takes the glass of wine and gives it to her
you really are a beautiful woman
pleased its not just inner beauty is it
marion whirls to show off her dress
youre all i desire
he reaches for an envelope on the desk
he gives it to her
marion opens it
there are several fifty pound notes inside
where did you get it
sold the car
you shouldnt have done that
i know what it meant to you
i owe you for the rent
its only a car
i can get another
take it back
till you sell your book
come on marion
lets face the truth
nobodys going to publish it
of course they will
you just have to be patient
im betting on you
she raises the glass of wine drinks
im not much of a bet
he drains his glass
you are to me
she takes her scarf puts it round his neck pulls him seductively towards the bedroom door
come into my world
she winds the black scarf across his face covering his eyes
whispering youre my prisoner
ive got something to tell you
i want to hear it
ive got a job
startled what job
marion pulls the scarf from his eyes
she wants to look at him
in a casino
as a croupier
how did you land that
it came my way
what did you do just walked in and said i want to be a croupier
dont you need training
i had training
in the republic
you were a croupier there
you never told me that
i thought you just knew some gamblers
i start monday week
from the street comes the whining sound of a car alarm
ive never earned that in my life
youre an enigma you are
a fucking enigma
not an enigma just a contradiction
marion looks deeply into his eyes
you sold the car
you got a job
whats the third thing
theres no third thing
dont be superstitious
i love you jack you know that
and he half loved marion
and she knew that too
outside the car alarm stops
jack takes marions head in his hands
she reaches for one of them examines it
are you trying to read my palm
youve got such beautiful hands
the hands of a conjuror a woman had told him once
or a card sharp
their hands interlock
she leads him into the bedroom
jacks hands are being worked on by a woman manicurist
what line of work are you in
im an undertaker
the manicurist stops for a moment looks at him with curiosity
a barber is cutting jacks hair
he goes up jacks neck with electric clippers
jacks hair is now black
do you work round here
my office is in shanghai
surprised what do you do
im an arms dealer
the barber stops for a moment nonplussed
in front of the mirror jack buttons a white shirt and skillfully ties a black bow tie
his short hair is lacquered back
he reaches down for his black jacket
puts it on
the transformation is complete
as he scrubs his nails jack sees a woman in the mirror
she is changing her clothes
she pulls off her indian cotton dress
shes wearing pants but no bra
quite unselfconsciously not looking jacks way she dresses in her casino clothes
jack dries his hands
the woman smiles at him
fits herself into the uplift bra welcome to the cesspit
is it that bad
starts to do up her top how do i look
like trouble bella
you look fine
the punters love it
tits in uniform
jack appears at the head of the table
the punters look at him not recognising him
the usual bunch
they didnt know jack but he knew them
good evening ladies and gentlemen
a fat indian punter addresses jack
wheres the other fellow
he doesnt work here any more
well lets hope you know your job
a middle aged woman trying to look as young as possible throws pounds in cash to jack
she turns to the woman next to her who looks very similar
perhaps this man will bring us luck
the woman has sensed her friends interest in jack
to jack whats that aftershave youre wearing
never converse with the punters
it slows things down
speed is volume and volume is profit for the casino
aim at twenty spins an hour
jack pretends he hasnt heard the question
in the background reynolds is watching as jack spins the wheel
last bets please
a plastic looking blonde woman heavily made up sits at the table
she nods to jack
punters are placing their bets
she has casino chips of denominations in front of her
jack notes the large sum
the blonde puts on red and on black
punters round the table are astonished at the size of the bet and the strangeness of betting both red and black
jack spins the wheel
black comes up
jack takes the red loss and moves it across the table to the black win
the blonde picks up the without a reaction and leaves the table
jack notices that she goes straight to the cashiers desk
jack clears the chips away starts to pay out
a white haired man on jacks right speaks to him youre new here
youll get used to madame claude
she comes in once or twice a week and does that
he knew the scam
come in with five grand cash
no questions asked
launder it by getting a casino cheque when you cash in
jack wondered why mr reynolds permitted it
after all theres was no profit in it for the casino
or was there
a different set of punters
the wheel spins
a greek man sits at the table
he doesnt attempt to bet
he looks around to see a croupier in his late s waiting to replace jack at the wheel
this is matt
he gives jack a curious complicitous smile
jack collects the chips and pays out
thank you very much ladies and gentlemen
im going to hand you over now to my colleague
matt takes over
good evening ladies and gentlemen
reynolds appears and takes jacks arm
quietly good work jack
you handled yourself well
at the table matt glances at the greek man
jack is now dealing to five punters
he has a and a exposed for the house
two players go bust
one player sticks on the next on
the last player buys a card for
jack turns over an ace for the house
he twists again
its a making
the two losing players groan
the last player is paid evens for equalling the house
one of the players whos gone bust gets up having lost all his chips and leaves
suddenly a delayed wave of elation came over him
across the casino an oriental man mr tchai is walking towards the table with reynolds
behind him is a foot bulging bodyguard
reynolds comes up to jacks table
why dont you take a break jack
puzzled all right mr reynolds
he moves his chair back nods at the remaining players
mr tchai sits down watched by the bodyguard
bella comes up smiles sweetly and takes over from jack
good evening mr tchai
tchai pulls out a sealed bank packet of
enjoy yourself mr tchai
reynolds waves to a waitress who comes over
to mr tchai your usual sir
he hands her a note
thank you sir
enjoy your game
for a diet coke
waitresses were the true winners in the casino
they were the only members of staff allowed to accept tips
on a good night they could get between and
the waitress goes
the other players at the table look at mr tchai wondering who he is
reynolds walks with jack across the casino
mr tchai always likes to play at that table and only with bella
does he win
smiles hes a good customer
a good customer is a consistent loser
was that what mr reynolds meant
jack is changing into his street clothes
the young croupier matt comes up to him
where do you live jack
over the river
have you got transport
jack shakes his head
im going over the river
ill give you a lift if you like
matt puts the car into gear drives off jack sitting beside him
so how do you feel your first night
ill bet youre on a high
shes my baby
how long have you worked at the casino
coming up to two years now
mysteriously but i was away for six months
youve done pretty well
smugly not bad
i have other interests of course
matt spins the car round a corner
im off to a little watering hole
why dont you join me
no thanks matt
i need my eight hours
ill lay you five to one you wont sleep
in this job you have to unwind
otherwise itll kill you
i mean that
some other time
jack pours himself a vodka smoking a cigarette
jack starts to take his clothes off
marion is asleep in bed
whats the time
i dont know
clock beside the bed reads
how did it go
he gets into bed beside her
she takes him in her arms
what is it
thisll relax you
she starts to massage his neck his hair
i loved it blond
its only hair
i havent changed
marion is dressed in a suit preparing to leave
she throws her nightgown into a laundry basket
jack is asleep
she bends to kiss him
when you get home im asleep
when i leave home youre asleep
dreamily ill see you in my dreams
marion drops a set of keys into her bag glances at jacks covered computer
she draws the curtain back
daylight illuminates the old etching of cape town
jani de villiers is something blonde tanned expensively dressed in designer clothes
she gives jack ten notes
in s please
he slots the cash into the bank beneath the table then counts out in chips
he slides the chips towards her looks at her
there are ten other people at the roulette table
an arabic looking man with a moustache behind jani is looking down the front of her dress
frowns place your bets
around the table the punters move their chips onto numbers lines colours
jani throws three chips to jack and calls the numbers
jack places them for her
jack could see this woman was an experienced gambler
professionals always place their bets through the croupier
that way there are no comebacks
the wheel spins is the number
jack calls the number and puts the dolly on
jani smiles faintly
jack pays out across the table
jani leaves two chips on the man behind jani puts his chips on
jani glances up at him
she sees the man is betting with her
jack spins the wheel again
jani bets again on number
the man follows suit
the wheel spins
jack watches the table
jani glances at him
the man moves closer to the table to one side of jani
concealed in his hand is a chip
as the ball bounces round and lands again on number the man deftly adds the chip to the square
jack clocks it
im sorry sir thats a late bet
in arabic accent what are you talking about
its ive won
with this lady
carefully youve won with the two chips you placed earlier but the third chip was a late bet
i put them on together
im afraid thats not so sir
reynolds who has been watching the tables sees the beginning of an incident
he comes over
the man is getting angry
now look here you
is there a problem sir
this croupier is accusing me of cheating
it was a late bet
this gentleman has been following the ladys numbers and
the man interrupts jack and touches janis arm
to jani do you think i cheated
jack and reynolds wait
jack glances at jani
in my opinion
it was a late bet
i think we should talk about this sir
away from the table
i want to be paid
he bangs his fist on the felt
jack waits for reynoldss decision
reynolds looks at jack
pay the gentleman
reynolds steps back jack pays out jani and the man
the man takes his winnings
he looks at jack with hatred then leaves the table
reynolds watches him looks to jack and nods
jani collects her winnings and throws two chips to jack
she stands up to leave
im sorry madam we dont accept gratuities in the uk
its different in south africa
surprised you know where im from
jack nods and gives her back the two chips
ive lived there
sweetly well thank you anyway
jack watches her leave
bright woman he thought
she knew the rule of gold
quit when youre ahead
jani heads towards the cashier
jack sees reynolds arguing with the irate arabic man near the entrance
he looks back to the table
place your bets
on his way out the arabic man looks towards jack and makes an occult sign with his hand
it is late
there are few punters left at the tables
jack tidies up his table which is next to matts
he looks across at matt and sees the greek man who was at the table the first night when matt took over
the greek wins on a number
matt clears the table and counts out the greeks winnings quickly and efficiently
he sees that something is wrong
matt moves piles of chips across to the greek who doesnt look up
jack glances in the direction of the hidden video cameras and the crows nest
reynolds is in the back ground has seen nothing untoward
jack watches the greek pick up his winnings and leave
again matt is driving jack home
hesitantly look matt theres something i have to say to you
i saw you cheating
violently what the fuck are you talking about
that greek guy who won at the end
you paid him out in s not s
angry i dont cheat jack
youve got it wrong
im not going to report it
matt slams on the brakes
the car comes to an abrupt stop
matt turns to jack furious
what are you a cop
if i see you do it again ill report it
i dont get you
even if it was true which it isnt what the fuck difference would it make to you
because if a supervisor knew id seen you and i hadnt reported it id lose my job as well
and i cant afford that
so its mr clean
wise up jack this whole business is bent
the casino is nothing but legal theft
and thats ok
its the system
half the punters who come in are using stolen money drug money they havent earned it
we earn our money
softens im on your side jack
i dont need an enemy
youre talking about complicity
i dont know what that means
im talking about not rocking the boat
matt holds out his hand for jack
jack shakes it
ok now lets unwind
he puts the car into gear and drives off
matt was an escape artist
like jacks father
matts car pulls up in the parking lot at the back of the restaurant
he and jack get out of the car and go through the open kitchen door
the kitchen is full of people some involved in cooking some standing around smoking and drinking mostly greek
he shakes hands with a guy who looks like the owner
this is jack
jack shakes hands too
they cross the kitchen and go through a bead curtain
piped greek music is playing
a smoke filled private dining room
there is a poker game in progress
five men are playing a dozen girls are dotted about watching
there is a trestle table laden with greek food from stews to salad buffet style
an improvised bar with ouzo vodka and wine
its help yourself
who are these guys
mostly people in the casino business
a few drug dealers
and the girls
what are you drinking
on the rocks
jack pours himself a vodka scoops up some ice with his hand from a bucket
clouds of smoke envelop him
the noise is close to deafening
does bella come here
the poker game
a man with fair hair gets up kisses a girl whose dress is a bathing suit puts his arm round her and they wander off
matt is at the table
jack is replenishing his vodka
hey jack join us
laughs dont worry i wont report you
i dont gamble
girl appears behind jacks shoulder
you dont gamble but do you smoke
the girl has a joint in her over ringed hand
she is dressed in purple indian cotton
hands him the smoking joint how about now
she blows smoke in his face
jack drains his vodka pours himself another
jack comes into the gents another smoke filled room
three or four men are arguing over a drug deal standing in front of the urinal
one of them has an envelope full of cash another a packet of drugs
jack goes to a lavatory stall opens the door
in the stall the fair haired man who was at matts table is sitting on the lavatory his trousers round his ankles
the girl in the bathing suit is sitting on his thighs bobbing up and down
jack sees a butterfly tattoo on her left cheek the queen of spades
im on my way
jack puts his arm on matts shoulder at the poker table
i need to sleep
loosen up jack
if you dont this jobll get to you
the pressures too much believe me itll break you
the world breaks everyone and afterwards many are strong in the broken places
jack turns and leaves helping himself to another drink
wasnt he the one who shot himself
jack comes to the flat
he is drunk
he starts across the dark room
suddenly the light comes on
jack turns to see marion sitting in a chair in her night dress
whereve you been
ive got to give evidence in court at nine
dont play the cop with me marion
take that back
furious fucking take that back
im not a cop any more
i take it back
youre not a cop any more
youre a store detective
are you drunk
this fucking jobs getting to you
you havent written a fucking word since you started
do you have to swear all the time
hurt well thats my poor upbringing
i didnt go to no private school
i havent got no class
i want to live with a writer
not a fucking croupier
i dont even know what the word means
marion stop this
near to tears what do i mean to you
i want to know
there is a pause
youre my conscience
havent you got a conscience of your own
jack has no answer
he goes into the bathroom
the computer is still covered
jack is standing at the table dealing cards practising
one card slips
he swears silently
he flexes his fingers cracks his knuckle joints
he looks at a skirt legs high heels passing above the barred window
jack emerges from the underground one of the crowd
jack goes into a large department store
marion is store walking in the womens underwear department
it is sale time
baskets of tights and knickers on display
customers are rummaging
she is on the look out for thieves
she jumps as jack places his hand on her hip
what are you doing here
looks round nervously you know the rules
what about a drink on the way home
i dont finish till eight
make it nine and youre on
im on at nine
well thats our life now isnt it
jack pauses in front of an airline office
there is a large picture of cape town and a special ticket offer
jani comes out of the office
her hair tied back earlier in the casino is now glamorously fluffed out
she sees jack
he doesnt see her
thinking of going back
jack is startled
he doesnt recognise her for a moment
smiling you know what
id like to buy you a drink
its against the rules
dealers are forbidden to talk to punters
what are the odds of you being seen with me
impossible to calculate
jack knew that in reality all odds are calculable
the art deco bar
expensive people around
jani and jack are installed on a sofa
a waiter puts down two martinis
raises her glass to coincidence
drinks theres a casino in this hotel
im not much of a gambler really
i just like this bar
so why did you come to my casino
i was at a loose end
a friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership
first visit to london
i come every couple of years
i always think im going to stay
im from cape town originally i was born in the transkei on the wild coast
near the casino
in the casino
now theres a coincidence
my father used to gamble there
i loved the atmosphere
but it destroyed my poor mother
and the lies
gamblers are born liars
nods and superstitious too
its like witchcraft
theres an african in all of us isnt there
we all came from africa supposedly
do you believe in astrology
but then im a gemini and geminis dont believe in astrology
jani laughs out loud
you know you dont strike me as a typical croupier
jack notices her wedding ring
jani catches the look
im not married
i wear it to keep the flies off
looks at her watch i must go
let me pay for this
toss you for it
i dont gamble
jani nods stands up takes out a notepad and pen
she looks round feigning conspiracy
low voice i know this is verboten but if you feel like a chat or maybe dinner give me a call
she scribbles her name and phone number on the pad tears off the page gives it to him
ill understand if you dont
smiles but i hope you do
jack watches her go looks at the page shes given him
in front of a mirror jack trims his hair with nail scissors
he is dressed in his croupiers uniform
he straightens his bow tie
he didnt know why but hed started to dress for the casino at home
jack sits in the compartment
like a musician in his tuxedo going to the concert hall on public transport
an arab at the end of the table kisses all his chips and sets them out on the table
the wheel spins
jack looks round at the punters
the ball bounces falls on zero
a mediterranean looking man with a gold bracelet coughs
a gob of phlegm from his mouth lands on a pile of chips that jack is raking away
a woman in her mid thirties is appalled
would you mind being more careful sir
ive got flu
he coughs again but into a handkerchief
then go back home
to the zoo
jack clears the piles of chips to one side
he signals to a supervisor
the supervisor hurries over
this gentleman accidentally coughed onto these chips
i dont think it would be hygienic to stack them
the supervisor signals a waitress over
these chips have to be counted and put into the steamer
she looks at jack grimaces and takes the chips away
the last punters are leaving
the overhead lights come on
a croupier is wheeling away a trolley with thousands of chips
two men are covering the tables with shrouds
reynolds watches as jack and matt count the thousands of pounds putting them in piles
behind them is a large open safe
i cant give you a lift back tonight
reynolds places the notes in steel boxes
jack comes out
bella hurries after him following him round the corner
do you need a ride
my cars in the garage
maybe another time
ill take you up on that
he straightens his hat and walks off
bella walks the other way
a man lurks in the shadows ahead of jack
jack doesnt see him
but as he comes past the man steps out blocking jacks way
he is the arabic looking man jack earlier caught cheating at the casino with jani
you dont recognise me
you had me barred
you fucking little worm
wait a minute
you got yourself barred
it was you you shit
the man reaches forward and grabs jacks tie
he yanks it with farce
he rams his elbow into the mans chest
the man kicks jack on the shins
the man leaps at him
jack knees him in the groin
the fight is untidy and vicious
both men collapse struggling onto the pavement
a car appears a mini cooper
bella is driving
she sees the fight
jacks nose is bleeding
the man kicks him in the back
jack yells with pain gets to his feet
now im going to kill you
he boots the man in the head
bella gets out of her car and runs over to them
the man is screening under jacks repeated blows
bella pulls jack away
jacks face is masked with blood and fury
bella is frightened by jacks violence
we dont want the cops here
before she can get jack into her car he goes back to the man groaning on the floor
he stamps on the mans hand
bella is shocked
coldly he wont cheat again
bella pulls him away bundles jack into her car gets in drives away
water is running in the basin
bella puts jacks jacket on the lavatory seat
she starts to undo his tie
jack wipes his blood stained nose with a wet flannel
its the tension
she undoes his shirt and takes it off
she washes his torso cleans him up
jack looks at his shaking hands
bella takes him by the hand leads him into the bedroom
she sits him on the bed
the room is lit with coloured lamps
excuse the mess
jack pulls her suddenly into his arms pulls her onto the bed
she is startled
jacks hands open her blouse
he reaches for her breast
bellas surprise becomes excitement
he kisses her hungrily his hands rummaging in her clothes
she reaches for a side zip in her skirt
dont tear anything
bella kicks off her shoes
there is a burst of passion between them
for jack a continuation of the violence with the man on the street
for bella its a sudden release
her naked foot knocks over the bedside lamp
jack spreads bella on the bed
she tugs his trousers down
he rips her black underwear away
jack is lying sprawled on the bed with bella
she reaches across him and retrieves the fallen lamp
its funny isnt it
if that guy hadnt come up to you you wouldnt be here now
jack strokes her bottom
i hate cheats
all men are cheats
bella picks up a joint from the bedside and lights it
i spent two years on the game
i dont mind telling you that
jack looks at her
but dont worry im clean as a whistle
i only did s m
she hands the joint to jack no blow jobs
why did you quit
i got scared
inhales i can imagine
im happy being a dealer
at least the punters keep their hands to themselves
you called the casino a cesspit
well it is
but i know where i am
jack hands the joint back to bella
ive been watching you work
youre the best in the place
but you know that
i despise the job
ah we all say that
but if we hate it why do we do it
jack doesnt answer
jack wanted to say we do it for the money
but that wasnt really true
bella leans over jack and begins gently to massage his flesh
what do you really want to do
she puts the joint in an ashtray
the indian rope trick
look now im pumping you
its none of my business
its just that youre not like the others
not like matt you mean
now hes a real shit
dont get friendly with him
im sure hes got his hand in the till
you know what he said to me once
i want to fuck the whole world over
thats my mission
bella touches a bruise on jacks body
she kisses the bruised skin pulls him to her
bella simply wants to be held
jack could hear matt saying it
jack is at his desk typing intently
there is a pile of new pages in the sunlight
i want to fuck the whole world over
its my mission
marion passes in the foreground
she kisses him on the back of his head and leaves
jacks fingers move across the keyboard dancing
at last he had found what hed been looking for
a clear and simple theme
and a hero to act it out
pause chapter one
matt is shaving
i look like shit
jack is scrubbing his nails at a basin
rough life jack
a young woman appears in the mirror behind the two men
her name is pat
she is dressed like bella
matt and jack say hello
matt appraises pats appearance winks approval at jack
to matt what happened to bella
ill tell you later
jack is mystified
jack is dealing to mr tchai and three other men
one chair at the table is empty
what happened to bella
she was re assigned
he turns over his third card a king
the bank busts
jack pays out
jani sits down in the vacant chair
jack conceals his surprise a hint of nervousness
formally good evening
jani nods impassively
jack knew this was no coincidence
why had she come
the men look at the glamorous woman
mr tchai doesnt register her presence
he is as inscrutable as his bodyguard who hands him an envelope
jani takes out money from her purse
jack counts it
one thousand even
jack slots the money down counts out chips
bets are placed
the cards turn
mr tchai splits two aces
jani has a and
mr tchai receives two los and wins big
jani gets a and busts
he wondered if she believed he would bring her luck
janis face is impassive
she receives her cards
jani busts again
jack sweeps away the chips the cards
jani reaches into her bag takes out another thousand pounds
the men at the table look at jani
or did she think he would help her win
jani loses again
she is down to chips
she looks up at jack
their eyes meet hers desperate his helpless
mr tchai picks up on the look
he knew how to fix it for her
his father had taught him the trick
switch the sequence
bust the bank
the casino wouldnt spot it
but jack was wary of the punters
jack glances at the men at the table
he could see mr tchai was counting
he couldnt risk it
jani places her last bet glances at the mountain of chips in front of mr tchai
jack catches her look
jani reaches for her next card
jack observes her left hand
he noticed she wasnt wearing her ring
odds on shed sold it
jack plays out the hand
she immediately gets up
she is crushed
she walks away from the table
thank you she said
for what jack thought
jani de villiers knew the odds
tchai looks at jack
jack is sitting on the bed fully clothed
he is carefully sewing a button on his croupiers jacket
through the open bedroom door marion can be seen sitting on the sofa legs tucked under her reading the new typescript
the phone rings
in the bedroom jack picks up
is in a public phone
coloured lanterns hang round in the night
hows it going jacko
intercut between jack and jack sr
i took the job
good for you
i was wondering what happened
i tried to call you dad but they said your line was disconnected
jovially ah yes i moved house
needed a bigger place
hows that book of yours coming along
in the sitting room marion looks towards jack in the bedroom
im getting there
its good to have the job to fall back on isnt it
pause there goes my other phone
he hangs up
marion turns the last page of the typescript
jack comes in from the bedroom
marion says nothing
she puts the typescript down
marion gets off the sofa
i dont like it
i dont like it at all
you had a wonderful character before the gambler
he was so romantic
he was a loser
this guys a croupier
he cant lose
people have shat on him all his life
now hes in control
hes a winner
is that your idea of a winner
he doesnt give a shit about anyone
he uses people and interrupting its because of the sex isnt it
you dont like the sex in it
i dont give a fuck about the sex
most menll fuck a lamppost
hes just a miserable zombie
is that the way you feel now
is that whats happened to you
its a book
then why is he called jake
why dont you come clean and call him jack
softens theres no hope in it
its the truth
without hope theres no point to anything
now wait a minute
whats so hopeful about your job
spending the day catching poor people stealing
you said yourself the organised gangs get away with it
at least in the casino everybody gets caught
rich or poor the odds are the same
its all relative
its not relative
like your casino
its designed unfair
and your croupiers a little shit because he goes along with it
jack sees marion is getting really angry
he crosses the room pointedly takes marions handbag opens it takes out a national lottery card and receipt
the doorbell rings
coldly youre just like all those other dummies out there
fourteen and a half million to one
is that your idea of hope
the doorbell rings again
the door jack
jack hands her the lottery card and goes to the door opens it
bella stands there
you fucking little shit
you shopped me
what are you talking about
marion watches numb
reynolds got a doctor in
they forced me to take a dope test
it was positive
as you knew
i dont know anything about it
bella looks over to marion
your boyfriend fucked me smoked my dope then shopped me
what do you think of that
i cant get a job now
to jack you bastard
youre no different from matt
a pair of vicious little shits thats what you are
firmly look bella i dont know anything about this
you should talk to matt
youre all scumbags
without looking at marion bella suddenly kisses jack on the lips
bella looks hard at jack then leaves
jack pursues her
bella runs up the iron stairs to the gate at the top
without looking back she flings the gate shut goes off down the street
go after her
marion slams the door to the flat
jack is half way up the stairs alone
the rush hour
in the evening
jack watches men and women coming out the store
jack had no idea where marion was staying or with whom
he realised he knew little about her life
but then he had never asked about it
jack now sees marion
he is about to go up to her moving through the flow of the crowd then he stops
a man in his s tall with a moustache greets marion
hes been waiting for her
jack watches the two of them unseen
the man and marion exchange a few words
she smiles takes his arm
he leans forward to kiss her
for the first time in a long while jack thought about his mother
shed left when she couldnt take it any more
his father had said dont worry jacko shell come back
jack turns and walks away
but marion wasnt his mother
jack stands behind reynolds who is playing back a video of the earlier incident in which matt cheated with the greek
hes paying out in stacks of
i can see
he freezes the frame presses a button zooms in on the detail of matts hand covering the chips
on another video monitor matt is dealing blackjack
reynolds looks at the screen
his existence was forming an interesting pattern of betrayals
sometimes he was unsure whether he was the betrayer or the betrayed
reynolds looks up from the screen
grudgingly thanks for the information
pity about bella
she was a real asset
but what could i do
jack lights a cigarette
shakes his head sorry
no smoking in the nest jack
working at his computer jack lights one cigarette from another
he pauses from his typing
on the desk beside him is the note with janis phone number
he picks up the phone starts to dial then stops replaces the receiver
he looks distracted lost
on the table marions flowers are dead in the vase
jack comes downstairs from the upper floor
he is looking at a book he has selected scarne on cards
across from the cash desk near the entrance a book signing is in progress
a small crowd surrounds a middle eastern author called habib dressed in a kaftan
giles is with him
a photographer is there
a few camera flashes
giles sees jack at the cash desk
he is uncertain for a moment then smiles
hearing his name jack turns
giles comes over
i thought it was you
its the hair
touching the back of his neck im working on that soccer story
suddenly look i must get back to habib
hes a terrorist
hes written a kill and tell book
puts his hand on jacks shoulder take care
giles heads back to the signing
the cashier puts jacks book in a bag
giles stops thinking of something
he comes back to jack
jack look next weekend im having a house party
removes a card from his pocket book its near oxford
why dont you come
itll just be social
conspiratorially bring a friend
ive plenty of room
looks at the card ill try and make it
giles goes back to his group
jack looks round the bookstore sees thousands of books in piles
books piled like chips
stack em high
sell em fast
make a killing
you think youre a gambler giles but youre not
youre a dealer
a camera flash
janis white honda winds its way through the wintry oxfordshire countryside
the moon is bright
jani wearing dark glasses is driving
jack beside her reads a map with a torch
i dont know how you can drive at night with those glasses
she turns and smiles at him
her left hand is bandaged
how did you hurt your hand
just an accident
turn left ahead
the car turns into a lane
jani theres something i want to say
before we get there
i dont know what the sleeping arrangements are
giles probably expects us to share a room
the hondas tyres crackle on the gravel drive which leads to a floodlit yellow stone country house
there are three cars parked outside the entrance
the honda stops next to them
jack prepares to get out
jani catches his arm
she takes off her dark glasses
her right eye is bruised
theres no point pretending it was an accident
i had a fight with someone thats all
in the distance there is the sound of a tennis ball being struck
a floodlit tennis court
a racquet smacks a tennis ball
jack sits with giles drinking bloody marys watching a game of mixed doubles
everybodys wearing sweaters
jani is playing with one of giless friends gordon
on the other side two girls fiona from giles office and chloe gordons girlfriend
jack follows janis game
she is far and away the best of the four
giles is also studying janis movements her knickers when she serves
shes a dab hand with a racquet your friend
south african women are very sporty
jack watches janis strong leg muscles as she moves about the court
i can see
how did she get that shiner
jack has been waiting for this
i found her in bed with someone
surprised who was he
youre a dark horse jack
on court jani delivers a winning overhead smash
the four players shake hands across the net
they come off the court
gordon puts his arm around jani
his girlfriend chloe notices
jack is irritated
giles catches the moment
to jack you dont play tennis
i dont play anything
how boring for you
jani moves deliberately away from gordon who clearly fancies her and sits down beside jack
she pointedly kisses him on the cheek
giles glances at gordon who shrugs
fiona comes up to giles
wheres our drinks
theyre so bloody selfish
to jack im so glad you brought me
jack wouldnt have come without her
jack and jani giles gordon and their two girlfriends are sitting down with drinks at a card table
gordon opens a fresh deck of cards
i dont gamble
dont be a spoilsport
its only a few quid
its nothing to do with money
i dont gamble
giles looks to jani to persuade him
he doesnt gamble
insinuatingly jack likes to watch
to jani does he like to watch
jack is getting angry
jani is calm
to gordon one more remark like that and ill break your balls
there is silence
gordon is embarrassed
fiona looks at chloe theyre shocked and impressed
laughs ill bet she could too
jack defuses the atmosphere
ill deal but i wont play
he sits down picks up the cards
you sure you know how
jack takes the pack of cards splits it expertly into two shuffles by pressing the two halves together open palmed
there is a rattling noise as the cards fold mechanically into one another leaving the pack as if it hadnt been shuffled
fiona and chloe are fascinated
do that again
jack gives the cards to his right gordon cuts them
another immaculate professional shuffle and out come the cards from jacks right hand flicking across the table
as the cards land they fall exactly next to one another in front of each player
at the end of the deal five players are looking at a neat fan of five cards before them
dont they look pretty
they all pick up their cards
frowns theres nothing pretty about this hand
youre not supposed to talk giles
hes probably lying
he does that
jack catches janis eye
jack deals the cards
ive got an idea
why dont we
were not having that again
glances at jack although
ill stick to bluffing
thats what im best at
jani smiles says nothing
jack slides the pack to jani
she looks up at him and cuts the cards
jack deals the cards deftly
the five players pick up their cards
before each player calls we hear jacks voice
in the end he correctly predicts their call
is it telepathy
or something else
oh i dont know
the players examine their hands
the women are pleased
the men say nothing
jani puts her cards together
the betting begins
no one drops out
the raising goes round three times
i havent got any more cash
the betting comes to an end
jack watches as they turn their hands over
gordon turns over a straight
chloe turns over a flush
fiona turns over a full house
not so fast darling
disbelieving hang on chaps
giles turns over four of a kind
hows about that for impossible
laughter cries of amazement
whats going on
jack is impassive
they all look to jani who turns over one card at a time a straight flush
what are the odds for this happening
more laughter cries of amazement
thousands to one
i couldve won if id been able to bluff
jani leans forward and takes the pot
giles looks at jack then at jani
i get it
smiles are you accusing me of cheating
good god no
but with skill like that what do you want a job for
you dont need to work
jack sits on the side of a four poster bed and takes off his shoes
on the other side of the bed jani unzips her skirt
she looks round the room
here was an interesting question
was writing work
jani puts her skirt over a chair and goes into the bathroom
she doesnt close the door
jack continues undressing
from a hold all he removes a pair of pajamas
he glances at the open bathroom door then climbs into his pajamas
he has two ugly bruises on his chest from the fight with the arabic man
jani comes out of the bathroom naked
she sees his body
remember the guy who cheated at the table
you dont like cheats do you
she walks across to her case opens it rummages around and takes out a nightie
this without the slightest hint of embarrassment
jack goes into the bathroom to brush his teeth
jani climbs into bed
which side do you like
calling you choose
they get into bed
that trick tonight i dont think ive ever seen that before
it can only work with amateurs a pro would have spotted it
then youre not a pro
jani leans over and turns off the lamp
her hair brushes jacks face
in the deserted hall is a nineteenth century painting a copy of gericaults raft of the medusa
the picture light illuminates the group of men and women clinging to the raft and to each other
i need your help
jack wakes drowsily
im in trouble
what kind of trouble
i owe a lot of money
was that why you did the two grand
i couldnt help you
i know that
but you can now
i dont have any money
switches on the light
jani is looking distressed
some people i know theyre planning to rob the golden lion
jack sits up turns on the lamp
you dont mean that
jani pulls up the bedcover around her body
they mean it
one night around three in the morning theyll come into the casino interrupting forget it jani
itll never work
the point is they want a man inside
laughs and i thought you were a bright woman
you dont have to do anything criminal
smiles robberys not criminal
jack gets out of bed tours the room
you dont have to be criminal
a man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat
youll see him stop him and the guy will make a big scene
therell be chaos
and thats when itll happen
you wont be committing a crime
the man will cheat youll just be doing your job thats all
jack comes right up close to jani in bed
and i thought you were only after my body
ive come to know you
takes his hand i trust you
whatll you do when it all goes wrong
but if it does
you keep the ten thousand pounds
what ten thousand pounds
jani gets out of bed
these people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after
they want someone they can be sure of an honest dealer
thats the point
not all dealers are honest
mr reynolds will never suspect you
youve done your research
she puts her hand on his
i didnt know what else to do
youre my last chance
she takes his hand and puts it on her bruised eye
next time itll be my neck
what about my neck
jani is close to breaking down
her toughness evaporates
i want to go back to cape town i want to start again clean
i cant do it jani
im asking you as a
youd be saving the life of a friend
jani goes back to bed
she turns out the light
jack stands in the middle of the dark room
jack comes out of the bedroom in his pajamas wearing his hat
he walks slowly down the passage
he hears the sounds of love making coming from one of the rooms
he passes the raft of the medusa as he goes down the stairs
jack comes into the kitchen switches on the light
he goes to the refrigerator takes out a bottle of vodka
he washes a dirty glass and pours himself a drink
jack wondered why he was even considering it
that was why
but jack didnt need the money
his father would have taken it like a shot
but his father was a gambler
he downs his drink and leaves the kitchen
jack walks back to his room
there is silence now no sounds of sex
he was always broke
jake suddenly realised
it was jake who was considering it
jack comes in tosses his hat on the bed
jani isnt in the bed
the bathroom door is afar
he hears the sounds of gasping
he rushes to the bathroom
jani is holding her head over the lavatory bowl
jack runs some water in the basin
he helps her to her feet and gives her a glass of water
she washes out her mouth
she looks at him tears running down her face
i want you to forget what i said
wait a minute
no forget it
the bets off
she reaches forward for a toothbrush and starts to clean her teeth
what about your father
can he help
she spits the water out of her mouth kisses him on the forehead and goes back into the bedroom
jack looks at his reflection in the bathroom mirror
he strokes his hair down
why dont you just go back to south africa
he leaves the bathroom
jack gets back in bed with jani
they turn away from each other and prepare to sleep
how much do you owe
let it go
did they tell you to sleep with me
i told you all bets are off
jack wakes as jani is dressed getting ready to leave
she bends and kisses him
i have to take the car
she looks at him then leaves the room hang on tightly
let go lightly
jack comes into the kitchen
giles is making coffee
chloe is sitting at the table half asleep in her nightgown
and your lady
she had to leave early
she asked me to thank you
a bit unexpected wasnt it
hows that football story corning along
you said it was going to be social giles
he was overcome with a sense of urgency
he had to get it down
jack comes in puts down his overnight bag
he yawns heads for the bedroom
suddenly he sees that the vase of dead flowers is now full of fresh blooms
underneath is a small box gift wrapped
jack opens it
inside the tissue paper is a tiny gold charm on a chain
he examines it
close up the charm is a book no title engraved
jack is touched
jack comes into the room
marion is in bed asleep
he looks at her smiles
he starts to get undressed
jack puts the book charm around his neck
she moves from the middle to one side of the bed making room for him
he holds the charm
i hope it brings you luck
marion i havent brought you much luck have i
perhaps we shouldnt be together
that girl she works at the casino i dont care about her
of course i was angry
but not with you
the book is yours not mine
i was wrong what i said about it
i hurt you didnt i
youre entitled to your opinion
its none of my business what you write
and your job thats none of my business either
i love you
and ive done everything wrong
jack takes her in his arms
ill leave the casino soon
he strokes her hair i promise
within a month
believe me im going to quit
they begin to make love
she holds the back of his head
then you can dye your hair blond again
jack is asleep in bed with marion
he is murmuring indistinguishable words
it wakes her
she gently touches his shoulder
he opens his eyes
you were talking in your sleep
jack is at work alone
the phone rings
he leaves it and continues i working
then he hears janis voice
i need to see you
i have a new number
please call me
there is a click
jack scribbles the number down and resumes work
jack gets off a train
he is dressed as a croupier
he walks to a public telephone on the platform taking janis note from his pocket
he dials the number
the noise of the train and passengers makes it difficult to hear
the phone at the end rings and rings
i want to speak to jani de villiers
ill come over now
he takes out a notepad and writes down the address
jack walks down a street of rough transients hotels
the street lamps are on
jack had decided to see her
the challenge was essential
he comes up to a hotel called journeys end
he goes in
jack climbs the creaking stairs under the fluorescent lights
he knocks on a door
jani opens it
she wears mens pajamas
she looks unslept
she glances up and down the passage
jack goes in
jani carefully closes the door
jack looks round the dingy room
its not the ritz this time
she switches on a standard lamp looks at him
is it yes
reflected in a mirror she opens her bag and takes out an envelope gives it to jack
he looks inside
four bank packets of
it doesnt seem fair
youre offering me ten grand in cash but you cant afford a decent place
well lifes not fair
we know that
its all relative
i need the money too
the dates not set yet
ill call you
one last thing the man youre going to catch cheating he may get violent
but you know how to deal with cheats
looks at her face that bruise has cleared up nicely
touches her eye oh yes
touches his chest ive still got mine
jack looks at her hand
and your hand too
coolly i took the bandage off yesterday
she crosses to pick up a bottle of scotch
would you like a drink
no thank you
jack puts the envelope in his pocket
they look at each other
i dont think we should meet again
nods its a shame there arent more men in the world like you
jack goes up to jani and kisses her on the mouth
she puts an arm around him
there was a part of jani he really liked
he turns and leaves the room
jack comes out of the hotel walks up the street
question was he gambling taking janis money
because he wasnt betting with his own money
he was being paid in advance for a service
at the roulette table jack spins the wheel throws the ball
in reality there were two clear elements of risk in this exchange
one the possibility the cash was counterfeit
two the possibility jani or her creditors would want the money back if the plan failed
a middle aged man is sweating
he fingers his last chips
he reaches for a number hesitates
jack sees that the mans hand is shaking
to begin with he put the odds at against
he checked a random selection of bills at a bank
they were all good
across the table a well dressed jewish woman in her fifties is sitting next to a young man a gigolo type the top three buttons of his shirt undone
she too hesitates with her bet looks down at her card marked with the last thirty turns
so now his odds were decidedly better
he put them at to
the fact that the notes were good gave him one less negative
at the same time mathematically he had one more positive
the woman looks up at the young man
she hands him the chip
bring me some luck
the young man smiles
takes the chip and puts it on
the middle aged man puts his chips on and
he prays silently
the roulette table
the ball is bouncing in and out of numbers
no more bets
the middle aged man closes his eyes
the woman puts her hand on the young mans arm
he had to be secure at to against having to give the money back so he wouldnt spend it
if after one month no one had approached him he calculated the odds of keeping it at to
after three months he figured to no one would turn up
the ball bounces into
the woman gives a cry of joy
she grips the young mans hand
he leans over to her eyeing her diamond necklace and whispers something seductive in her ear
she stiffens with apprehensive pleasure
the middle aged man opens his eyes there is a look of misery on his face
jack sweeps away the lost chips pays out five minor winners
he calmly counts a small pile of chips and slides them to the middle aged man by sleight of hand
then he prepares to pay out the woman
no one has noticed the pay out to the middle aged man
the man looks at jack incredulously
jack smiles mechanically
the man mouths the words thank you to jack
the woman looks up at the young man
she gives him a pile of chips
he gives them back
he kisses her neck
how about a drink to celebrate
the middle aged man stands up his face creased in emotion relief
to jack cash me in
jack converts the green coloured chips to in house chips
the man nods at jack who smiles formally
the man leaves the table
punters place their bets for the next spin
jack sees the man stop by the next roulette table
jakes experiment with the man would prove the point
the man hesitates
he cant resist
in close up the man puts two of the chips down
people dont change
marion drops a plate as shes drying the dishes
she swears and bends to pick up the pieces
marion undressed pulls the old nightgown from the laundry basket
she lets it fall back goes to look in the chest of drawers for another
she cant find one among the underwear
she goes on to jacks drawer and pulls out a shirt
she unfolds it
out drop the four packets of
she bends to pick them up
she looks at them incredulously
jack pushes several notes into the slot and counts out two piles of chips for a punter in front of him
he watched their faces as they lost hour after hour night after night relentlessly
jacks face as he deals
he questioned the conventional wisdom that gamblers are self destructive
the faces of punters around the table concentration grimness apprehension
he had come to believe that in reality they want to destroy everyone else their families and loved ones everyone
fuck over the whole world
the white balls lands
the faces of the losers resigned desperate angry
the punters who are cleaned out get off their chairs tear up their sequence cards turn and walk away quickly slowly
without emotion he watched them go
marion is lying awake alone in bed
the phone rings
she leans over to pick it up then doesnt
from the sitting room comes the message its set
the day after tomorrow
the twenty fourth
marion gets out of bed
she goes into the sitting room
marion replays the message
she stares at the phone
then carefully she presses the erase button wiping the message
she goes back into the bedroom
jack is at work
marions hands are massaging his shoulders
the little book charm dangles round his neck
arent you ever tempted to gamble
looks up never
why do you ask
i can just imagine being around so much money all the time
gamblings not about money
gamblings about not facing reality
ignoring the odds
she takes her hands away from his neck
i must be a fool
i never think about the odds
the sound of an underground train
jack sits impassively among noisy christmas travellers
the train stops
someone pops a balloon
jack gets up and alights followed by a streamer
he disappears into the crowd
jack hangs up his hat and coat examines himself in the mirror
he picks up a small roll of paper
he unfurls it
a christmas party hat
a christmas festive atmosphere
the casino interior is decorated with red and green balloons silver and gold streamers a large tree hung with chips
jack is dealing at a blackjack table
like the other croupiers and dealers he is dressed in a fancy red coat with green trim
he wears a silly paper hat
the punters at jacks table include mr tchai and four expensively dressed chinese men
the bodyguard stands behind them
they are gambling big money
wads of notes are changed into chips
jack is coolly winning for the house
reynolds looks on impassively in his santa claus suit
three or four punters are watching the chinese lose heavily
mr tchai and his friends occasionally exchange a phrase in chinese but they show no emotion as they lose
with each hand they prepare to lose even more
jack pushes hundreds of pounds into the box beneath the table
reynolds signals a security man to collect the cash which is building up
he comes over with a safety cart
during a short break the money is taken from under the table in a box loaded into the cart and wheeled away
two cold looking men in suits are drinking mineral water at the bar
they watch the security man with the cart pass by and disappear through a green baize door marked private
one of the suits looks at his watch five minutes to midnight
jack is now at a roulette table
he sees a punters watch
the atmosphere around the crowded table is noisy laughter loud voices
one of the two men in suits from the bar eases himself into a chair
jack sees him
the suit throws him
ten of them
what colour chips
jack gives him ten pale blue chips and puts another pale blue chip into the rack alongside the rainbow of colours used by the other punters
the suit looks at his watch
two men in raincoats detectives approach reynolds and talk to him
reynolds becomes nervous looks around the casino
the table at the bar where the suits sat is empty
the private green baize door slowly closes
the ball bounces into number
there are cheers of delight from the winners is heavily covered
the suit casually slides a pale blue chip onto the number at the side
jack sees the obvious cheat
so do other punters
stiffens sir i cant accept that bet
the suit gets up and comes around the table to jack
are you calling me a cheat
you are a cheat
i saw you
grabbing jacks lapel im talking to you
jack pushes him away
the suit hits jacks face with his fist
uproar around the table
jack hits the man
the suit grabs jack and pushes him backwards across the table knocking all the chips over
the punters start shouting
they grab their chips especially the losers
one punter tries to restrain the suit
jack kicks the suit hard
they fight trading blows
at the blackjack table mr tchai and the other chinese see the fight
mr tchai barks at the bodyguard in chinese
the bodyguard heads for the fight at the roulette table
two dealers rush over to stop the fight
somewhere in the distance there is the sound of a gunshot
people start screaming
the suit punches jack in the stomach
jack doubles up
the suit breaks away rushes across the casino pushing screaming women aside heads for the door
mr tchais bodyguard blocks his way and fells the suit with a hammer blow to the head
the two detectives come up
one of them handcuffs the suit who is lying on the floor
the casino is in uproar
a strange violent christmas party
jack lies groaning on the floor
mr tchai is standing watching jack
reynoldss voice comes over the tannoy system ladies and gentlemen please be calm
theres no cause for alarm
reynoldss voice is replaced by a breezy version of rudolph the red nosed reindeer
jack struggles to his feet amid the chaos
he falls back in pain
mr tchai and the other chinese leave the casino with the bodyguard
jack is sitting in a christmas decorated cubicle a curtain drawn round
an indian nurse is bandaging his arm
he has two large plasters on his chest
the nurse finishes the job smiles
there you go
she hands him two pills and a glass of water
in the background there are party sounds
the nurse leaves
jack fingers the charm around his neck
there is a pause
then the curtain is pulled back
she carries a bottle of wine and two cartons of chinese take away
jack is surprised
how did you know i was here
i thought you wouldnt want to spend christmas day alone in here
she starts to pour wine
jack is still puzzled
did you go to the casino
marion hands him a glass of wine
they touch glasses and drink
noodles or rice
as she opens the cartons jack watches her still uneasy
quietly i dont want a criminal for a boyfriend
suddenly there was a message wasnt there
its probably easier for you to eat the rice
what did you tell the police
nothing about you
give up being a croupier jack
or ill shop you
all you have to do is keep your word
its that simple
jack sinks back on the bed
she hands him the rice dish
use a spoon
leave me alone marion
youre already alone
he had always been alone
he had always believed it would make the decisions easier
i dont want to lose you
i swear to you
marion kisses him
why did you take the money
i hate public transport
i want to buy a car
laughs how can anyone be that naive
jack sits in front of reynolds
how do you feel jack
take your time
three if you need it
well pay you sick leave
i dont want to lose you
youre a good man
he hands jack an envelope
he opens the envelope
inside is a casino cheque for
smiles happy new year
have a drink on the company
youve earned it
jack is sitting at his computer drinking vodka dressed in his croupiers suit
on the soundtrack we hear the casino noise
its all numbers the croupier thought
a spin of the wheel
a turn of a card
the time of your life
the date of your birth
the year of your death
in the book of numbers the lord said thou shalt count thy steps
theres a ring at the doorbell
he looks at his watch
the i ring comes again
jack thought this is it
the famous two in the morning knock at the door
it wad pay back time
jack goes to the door
at the door
it was pay back time
jack goes to the door
but he wasnt afraid
he hadnt spent one penny of the ten grand
hed covered himself
he knew the odds
jack calmly opens the door
a uniformed policeman stands there
jack hadnt expected this
the sound of the roulette ball bouncing against the numbers
a police doctor uncovers a body on a gurney
the sound of the ball find ing a number
jack can hardly bear to look
it is marion
what were the odds of being killed by a car
on new years eve
she was on her way home
jack looks away from marions face
he sees the man with the moustache standing on the other side of the gurney the man he saw with marion on the street
he is detective inspector ross
jack is disorientated
marion had been visiting his mother
no no not his mother her mother
to ross she was visiting her mother
suddenly who are you
detective inspector ross
who did it
he grabs rosss lapels
ross carefully removes jacks hands
we think its a hit and run
a drunk driver probably but there is a possibility of a revenge killing
as you know she was a wpc with the met
up until two years ago
jack fumbles in his pocket for a cigarette
there is a no smoking sign on the wall
ross produces a zippo and lights jacks gitane
she called me last week
shed got wind of a planned robbery at your casino
what had that got to do with her death
you didnt recognise the man who attacked you did you
loudly of course i recognised him
surprised you did
i know a cheat when i see one
the man was a cheat
ross sighs looks at marion
jack suddenly reaches down and pulls the white sheet back over marions face
to ross do you gamble
ross is puzzled
jack drops his cigarette on the floor grinds it with his shoe
ross gives jack his card
if anything occurs to you call me
jack walks away from ross without a word
the doctor is now filling out a form
from the door jack looks back
ross waits for him to say something
jack doesnt speak
i was in love with her you know
there is a reprise of jack covering marions face with the sheet
in his croupiers suit jack walks the night streets
quoting the world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places
but those that will not break it kills
it kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially
if you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry
he passes a poster for the national lottery bearing the legend it could be you
jack doesnt see it
a woman smashes a plate over a mans head
its plate smashing party time greek style
twenty drunk people having fun
plates are thrown stamped on smashed
jack sits alone at a corner table drinking watching the fun unsmiling
one plate cracks into a wall behind him
a man stumbles backwards into jacks table
jack swiftly moves his drink out of the way
the man apologises turns to jack
it is matt
howre you doing
shakes jacks hand vigorously i heard about the raid
pity they didnt pull it off
i wish id been there
matt has to shout above the noise and music
quietly but you were there matt
matt doesnt hear
you know what happened to me dont you
that bitch bella shopped me
id like to beat the shit out of her
id like to buy you a drink
happy new year
i really like you jacko youre so fucking straight
suddenly hey you havent changed your clothes
there are four or five people left among the debris
matt has gone
jack is still there drunk now
the music stopped jack was drunk
he was back as a child in the wild coast casino
a black woman comes over to him
her name is lucy
youve been avoiding me
blearily have i
and what do you do lucy
im a witch
a white witch
why dont we move on
are you going to put a spell on me
lucy guides jack to a parked car
he is drunker than she
when he sees the car he starts to laugh
it is his austin healey
how much did you pay for it
she opens the door for him
they climb in
lucy starts the car
turn left at the lights
they drive off
a deserted intersection
the austin healey swings around a corner
a woman steps out from the kerb
he swings the wheel
the car swerves missing the woman
i saw her
jack looks back
the woman is shouting after the car
you dont trust women drivers do you
jack didnt trust anyone
jack sits at his computer
he is watching the printer unloading page after page
jack assembles the typescript
it was finally finished
he thought of sending it to giles
but that wouldnt be right
he would select a publisher at random like a number
close up the dedication to marion
the sound of the ball bouncing against the wheel
the ball falls into
jack puts the doll on
no one at the table has the winning number
jack sweeps away the losing bets
a blackjack table
the bets are placed
jack turns over the banks cards a king and an ace
he takes all the chips from the five punters
to jack youre wasting yourself
with your luck you ought to come over to our side
jack comes up to a bookstore window
a sticker reads its a winner
there are quotes blown up from the reviews an exhilarating contempt
the display is just one book i croupier
even his publisher had no idea who the author was
he had done the deal through a lawyer
it gave him a good feeling no one knowing
reynolds is reading the book
he laughs out loud at something
it never occurred to anyone at the casino that the golden lion had been his model
why should it
werent all casinos the same
jack is sitting in his croupiers suit on the crowded tube
he sees a woman reading i croupier
for the first time we see the back cover
it gave him an exquisite pleasure being an underground man
with all his money he hadnt even bought a car
jack knew the truth about himself he was a one book writer
a one time winner who had quit while he was ahead
five in the morning
he changed nothing in the flat bought nothing spent nothing
the only thing he did was to remove the bars outside the window
jack comes in
the phone rings
jani is holding a mobile phone
in the background is the casino room the lights colours rattling sounds
jack hesitates then picks up
the following conversation is intercut
where are you
ive been meaning to call you for months
smiles how are you
im getting married
at least i think i am
did you solve your problems
im all over that now
jack hold on a minute
theres someone here who wants to talk to you
a mans hand takes the phone from jani
jacko howre you doing
his arm round jani talks into the phone
i never thanked you properly for your help
jani told me you behaved like a perfect gentleman throughout
i knew you would
i know my son
jacks face is a mask tight fixed
the woman thinks im going to marry her
but you know me
its a shame things didnt work out
but we saw you all right
you didnt gamble the ten grand did you
huskily as a matter of fact i did
but i won
thats my boy
hows that novel of yours coming along
jack slowly puts the phone down
he takes a deep breath
so that was it
the final card
his father eight thousand miles and twenty seven years away was still dealing to his son jack from the bottom of the deck
close up a copy of the book i croupier
but jake the croupier had a sense of humour
laughing jack pours himself a vodka raises his glass
to both of you
he drinks at a gulp
standing in the doorway is bella wearing a nightdress
she is sleepy
what are you laughing at
who was that on the phone
a couple i know are getting married
bella puts her arms around him lovingly
a whistling sound
we are back in the first scene
the ball bounces around the spinning wheel
the faces of the punters
they are almost still
we do not see the croupier
now he had reached the point where he no longer heard the sound of the ball
nothing moves except the little white ball in the spinning wheel
the ball slows
the spin of the wheel had brought him home to the place where he was born
a hint of a smile
the croupiers mission was accomplished
the ball falls into green zero
jack rakes all the chips off the table
there are no winners
the film ends on a close up of jacks face
a look of calm satisfaction
at last he was master of the game
he had aquired the power
to make you lose
