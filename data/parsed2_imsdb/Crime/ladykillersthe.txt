screenplay by joel coen and ethan coen based on the movie the ladykillers by william rose specifically a garbage scow
we see it from on high chugging down the placid but mighty mississippi
head credits play over coverage of the garbage scow
no sound except for an incongruously heroic score
the coverage is a little rough coarse grained along with the overbearing score it almost suggests an industrial film rather than a feature
one piece of sound the toot of the boats horn is obviously library
and not a new library either
the garbage scow passes under a bridge spanning the broad sluggish waters and proceeds on to its landfill a steaming river island
disturbed gulls and other scavenger birds rise from where they were picking through trash
their squawks like the boat horn are not quite believable as sync
the head credits end as the anthemic music resolves
lies on the weather grayed and roughened planking of a front porch
the porch is half shaded from the noonday sun
it is quiet except for the chirr of heat bugs close by and very distant many voices in chorus engaged in divine worship in a baptist church sufficiently far away
that vagaries of breeze fan them in and out of audibility
we once again hear the toot of the scows horn distant now and played as real not slapdash effect
at this the dog lifts his nose to catch the breeze sniffs and then whining lowers his head to the floor and covers his snout with his forepaws
he huffs briefly and goes to sleep
we drift up to show that the dog is sleeping before the your source for worms lures etcetera etcetera
we travel over to reveal that the modest one story structure houses two establishments its other front door leads to the a campaign sign in the window on the municipal
side shows a black man of late middle age beaming and giving the viewer a thumbs up re elect wayne wyner sheriff he is too old to go to work
we hear snoring on top of a low steady hissing sound
we are drifting toward the door of the lock up which stands open
the small cell is empty its bed neatly made
we are arcing slowly around a jailers key on a ring that hangs from a nail
the offscreen snoring and whirring continues
the tracks shifting angle now makes the light catch a spider web spun between the key and the wall
we drift across the face of the radio
the peaceful steady hissing jumps in louder at the cut it is uninterrupted a transmissionless crimeless misdemeanorless idle radio hiss
the snoring is also louder here
as we travel off the radio we are coming onto a pair of feet propped up on the desktop
they belong to sheriff wyner tipped back in his chair fingers laced on his chest head lolling forward
as the moving camera finally ends on him there is the ring of a telephone muffled not present
it nevertheless rouses the sheriff who almost strangles on a snore as he awakes and then rocks forward to pick up his phone
the muffled ringing continues the sheriff looks puzzled at the phone
now the ringing stops and we hear a muffled voice next door worms
the sheriff replaces the phone leans back again adjusts his hat and is about to go back to sleep when we hear the front door open
the sheriff looks and reacts with genuine if momentary fear
he manages to compose himself and give the intruder a smile afternoon miz munson
entering is an elderly black woman in a floral print dress and fruited bonnet

john the apostle said behold there is a stranger in our midst come to destroy us
munson closes the door behind her
she wags a paper fan and mutters hes a good man
just needs instruction
dog you in peoples way
the dog stirs with a whine and ambles off
with a neatly tended garden
it is the last house on a street of other similarly modest but well maintained homes beyond it the street disappears down a bluff
the empty space beyond suggests a wide river and indeed we can see the top of an anchored gaudily painted paddle boat poking over the rise
the paddle boat is apparently anchored at the near bank of the river
munson is entering by the gate
she stops in the garden and stoops to pull a tiny weed marring the otherwise perfect row of flowers
munson lets herself in
a cat lopes up to her the bell around its neck tinkling and leans mewing into her leg
you need somethin to eat angel
munson hand cranks a can opener around a tin of cat food
the cat paces back and forth between her legs leaning into them and purring responding to the snap of tin as the cover comes off the can
the can contains cubed processed gizzard in a gelatinous medium like the stuff that clings to gefilte fish
above the fireplace is an oil portrait of a serious looking black man of late middle age with a neatly groomed mustache starting to gray
a couple of candles sit on the mantel below the portrait giving it the semblance of a shrine
munson enters and lights the candles
othar i wentn complained about weemack i hope itll do some good
that boy hangin by a thread
over the pit
i left my wallet in el segundo
she shakes out the match and sits in a rocker and takes up her knitting
as she sits she gives an audible groan
sixty seven years of life forty six years of marriage you mean to tell me you never one time suffered from piles
its the human condition most humans anyway
like that ball player said worlds got two kinds of folks them thats got piles and them thats gonna get em
but you was always healthy as an ox
there is the distant moan of a riverboat horn
passed on before you got piles
thank the lord you wasnt sick
you dont wanna sicken n die
no you wanna pass nice n peaceful
go to sleep one night wake up in the glory land
a gust of wind hums under the eaves the candles below the portrait flicker
munson looks around the room vaguely towards the ceiling sensing a negative aura the cat arches its back and hisses
at this moment the doorbell rings
well whos that now pickles
she grunts as she hoists herself out of the chair
she opens the door a draft the candles below the portrait of othar go out sending up thin wisps of smoke
the cat shrieks and bolts out the door past the man on the stoop goldthwait higginson dorr iii
he is a middle aged southern gentleman wearing a panama hat and a cape over a cream colored suit
he has dark circles under his eyes
the smile he attempts mournful yet courtly is wiped away by maam
go get im
i do beg your pardon
go get pickles i didnt let im out
tasting the name pickles
dorr walks down the stoop followed by the old lady
oh hes up the tree again
your gonna have to shimmy on up
i am so terribly sorry madam
but wont the feline eventually tire of his lonely perch and pining for his masters affection return on his own initiative
no he wont come down less you fetch him
hed set there til gabriel blows his horn if someone didnt shimmy up
up with you now
well then couldnt we perhaps offer him kitty treats and enticements or if not foodstuffs perhaps squeaky little toys of the kind formerly manufactured in hong kong but now produced
in the other so called little tigers
his fingers form the quotes
of the pacific rim
the point bein do we have to actually ascend the tree look i dont want no doubletalk
if you aint gonna fetch him down i guess i gotta call the po lice
his face darkens
they aint gonna be happy
every time they come fetch him down they swear they wont do it no more
dorr casts his hat aside and starts awkwardly climbing the tree
he gasps as he climbs no need to call the authorities
i did this often as a youth why i was a positive lemur
the cat backs away down a branch arching its back and hissing
dont upset him now
dorr on his stomach inches after the cat grunting i wouldnt dream of it
harmless little felix domesticus
come to the branch breaks hinging down to slam dorr face first into the trunk from where he drops the rest of the way to the ground
othars portrait upside down seems to be looking bemusedly down on us
an objective angle shows dorr lying on the couch a damp washcloth on his forehead eyes rolled back to look at the picture
munson is entering with a cup of tea
dorr swings his feet out to sit up and accept the tea
i thank you madam for your act of kindness
well you let him out
i certainly did and i do apologize no end
allow me to present myself uh formally goldthwait higginson dorr ph
what like elmer
beg your pardon maam
no no ph
is a mark of academic attainment
it is a degree of higher learning bestowed in my case in recognition of my mastery of the antique languages of latin and greek
i also hold a number of other advanced degrees including the baccalaureate from a school in paris france called the sorbonne
sore bone well i guess thats appropriate
you ever study at bob jones university
i have not had that privilege
its a bible school only the finest in the country
i send them five dollars every month
thats very gener im on their mailing list
im an angel
they list my name in the newsletter every issue
i got the literature here you wanna examine it
perhaps when my head has recovered from its
munson are you at all curious as to why i darkened your door as the expression has it on this lovely camelia scented morn
i was wondering til you let pickles out
then in all the excitement i quite understand
the fact is that i saw the sign on your window advertising a room to let and it is the only such sign among the houses of this charming charming
yeah i got a room
im lookin for a quiet tenant
fifteen dollars a week i quite understand
madam you are addressing a man who is quiet and yet not quiet if i may offer a riddle
he sets down the teacup and rises
perhaps you can show me the room mrs
munson and allow me to explain
well you can see the room but i dont like double talk
munson precedes him
up the stairs
you see madam i am currently on sabbatical from the institution where i teach the university of mississippi at hattiesburg
i am taking a year off to indulge my passion i dont believe that is too strong a word for the music of the renaissance
i perform in and have the honor of directing a period instrument ensemble that performs at renaissance fairs and other cultural fora
they enter a small bedroom
there is a small bed on a brass frame a chair a wash basin and cheerful yellow chintz drapes on the window
dorr appreciatively takes it in
thoo out central and southern mississippi
we perform on the instruments for which the music was originally composed in the belief that
why this is lovely
wait a minute
you got some kind of band
dorr once again wiggles quotes with his fingers the word band would be in this context something of an anachronism
though we do play together hence the word ensemble the nature of the music is such that one would hesitate to apply the epithet band with its connotations of jangling
rhythm and ear popping amplification
so you dont play hippity hop i left my wallet in el segundo songs with the titles spelt all funny
madam i shudder
the revulsion i feel for modern popular music and all other manifestations of contemporary decay is i have no doubt the equal of yown
why we play music that was composed to the greater glory of god
well inspired by the gospels certainly
the vintage of course is no more recent than the rococo
well i guess thatd be okay
but i certainly dont propose to inflict our rehearsals on you
may i enquire do you have a root cellar
dorr ducks while descending the steep narrow stair in order to avoid an overhead beam
he is followed by mrs
yes yes yes this looks promising
he pulls on a hanging string to light a bare bulb overhead
little dank aint it
oh indeed but that only improves the acoustics
he experimentally claps his hands
these earthen walls are ideal for baffling the higher registers of the uh lute and uh sackbutt
thats why so much music of the cinquecento was played in crypts and catacombs
yes this will do nicely
he dry washes his hands with enthusiasm but his tone remains mournful
this is perfect
this is more than perfect
i can scarcely contain my glee
you containing it okay
he starts to peel cash out of a large well worn billfold allow me to pay you a week in advance
allow me to pay you two weeks in advance
allow me to pay you a month in advance
i cannot countenance the thought of these charming apartments being tenanted by someone unappreciative of their special je ne sais quoi
that would be a shame
on the cart is a boombox
it is playing i left my wallet in el segundo
it is being pushed through a casino empty of customers
as the cart stops and a wastebasket is emptied into it you gotta peel this shit out sticks to the bottom
shows two youngish black men in the khaki uniforms of custodians
emptying the wastebasket is weemack mackatee funthes
he is instructing gawain macsam
you wouldnt believe this shit sometimes even out here on the casino floor you gonna find sanitary napkin shit stuck there tucks i dont know what the fuck people do
while theyre gambling here man
i aint peelin funky shit with my human hands man
thats a prescription for disease and viruses and shit attackin yinsides
as they roll on we see more of the gambling floor which is on something less than the scale of a las vegas casino
the floor is not yet open and dealers stack and count chips at the tables pit bosses with clipboards looking over their shoulders
other dealers strap on visors and sleeve garters preparing to work
you gotta do it
gudge checks everything
man is a motherfuck
shit looka this
after a furtive look around he plucks a chip from the next wastebasket and slips it in his pocket
you keep an eye out man
i found a hundred dollar chip once
fuck that man
i aint pawin through used tucks for a fi dollar chip
i said it was a hundred
man your guts gonna turn to soupn leak outcha fuckin asshole
the cart jitters loudly on the dimpled plastic floor
this tunnel leads back onto land
to the office for all the people work for mannex
owns the lady luck n three other boats
the two men are entering a windowless fluorescent lit office area
a row of wooden office doors and one heavy steel door
this is where they think on their corporate shit gudge and them
he stops to empty a wastebasket
the lights is ugly but it aint as many tucks
he bangs on the steel door yo motherfuck
whats the password
kiss my ass
we hear a deep chuckle and the door steel reinforced swings open
the two men enter weemack nodding at the security man this is where they count the dough
you try to take any of it elron there shoot your ass
again the security man chuckles
weemack picks up some fast food wrappers
this place is a fuckin pigsty
you a pig man nothin but a squeaky ol motherfuckin pig
he is an enormously fat man his chuckles come from deep deep in his chest
you got fuckin kocoa krispies in ya uniform man still got breakfast there and you eatin motherfuckin lunch
elron uses one hand to swipe crumbs off his uniform shirt chuckling
you a disgrace before motherfuckin god
you a motherfuck oh hello mr
gudge how we be this mornin
a man in a buttoned white shirt nods at him
hows the new man
he is a cleaning motherfucker man
is that a fact
it is a ruin of a field charred trees point bare and gnarled limbs toward a gray sky smoke drifts across the desolate waste
something is bounding towards us from the deep background
we boom down as it approaches a bulldog running avidly toward us on its stumpy little legs
an offscreen male voice clark pancake one mountain
there is an explosion that showers dirt in front of the dog and makes it veer
something strapped around the dogs neck bounces as he runs
another explosion makes the dog veer back so that it once again bears on us
the thing that has been bouncing around its neck flies off
our continuing boom down has brought us to ground level just as the dog arrives in front of us to feed at a dog food bowl in the foreground
the yellow plastic bowl has a k ration logo facing us
we hear another offscreen voice director cut goddamnit
his canteen fell off
the directors feet enter in the foreground
he hooks the dogs belly with one foot and hoists it roughly away from the bowl
we the director
he scowls down at the animal
a man in a hemingway field jacket with multiple pockets and also a loaded utility belt trots up toward him his belt jangling as he runs
this is clark pancake
pancake is a florid beer bellied man in his late fifties
he has a full blond grey grizzly adams beard and wears multi pocketed shorts that form an ensemble with his hemingway jacket
the director is angry
the goddamn things canteen fell off
it would have been a good take
pancake is unperturbed
were prepared for that
he hits a button on the radio on his belt and talks into his headset mountain bring otto with the apparatus
he strains at his lead muscling forward as quickly as his minder and his own stumpy little legs will allow
he peers through the two goggly eyeholes of an antique leather gas mask its pignose breathing apparatus covering his own snout
his phlegmy breathing is amplified by the device
we tilt up the lead to show his minder mountain girl
she is a solid woman in her late forties with freckles beginning to merge into age spots
her long straw colored hair is tightly braided into heidi pigtails bound with red ribbon
otherwise her dress is unadorned
the director squints at the dog
what the hell is this
pancakes manner is professorial world war i vintage gas mask
strapped on of course so it cant fall off
the animal is free to be as active as he wants doesnt inhibit his movement and i think it really sells the whole doughboy thing it looks like a fucking
pancake stares at the director for a moment and though not doing anything makes a sound of concentrated effort nnnnrnff
the director squints at him what
pancake comes out of his trance or whatever it was no nothing uh
youre absolutely right the gas mask is a whimsical concept how the hell does it eat when it gets to the kennel rations
the dog looks up from person to person as each speaks twisting its neck to peer through the eyeholes
its breathing is growing louder
well youre absolutely right dont let the client see this
of course not that would be inappropriate or the humane fucker
no no the dog gets down on its knees slowly like a camel breathing ever more loudly
theyll shut the fucking spot down pancake
put the goddamn canteen back on
that says hes a soldier
dented tin canteen
just tie the damn thing to his collar
the dog flops over into the mud
easiest thing in the world
i just thought but the canteen is much better
lets go with that whats he doing
the dog has started to convulse
well hes uh
just breathe normally otto
the fucking dog cant breathe
oh he can breathe that thing is just breathe normally otto
the dogs breath is rasping and horrible
the fucking dog cannot breathe
get that fucking thing off him
easiest thing in the world
he stoops and fiddles at the straps
its on good and tight i uh
just breathe normally otto
he starts thumping at his pockets
get the fucking thing off him
dont have my leatherman
give me your leatherman
get the fucking thing off him
chitra make sure the humane fucker doesnt come over here
bring him to craft services
as he makes to scoop up the dog good idea
ice water treats not the dog you idiot
the humane fucker
he goes back to work on the mask
oh my god hes bleeding
no thats me i the leatherman
here we go
his hand gouting blood he finally manages to get the gas mask off
a crowd is starting to gather and gape
the director barks at a grip put up a couple solids here i dont want the client seeing this
pancake thumps on the inert dogs chest
come on otto
otto is fucking dead
mountain have electric run me a stinger
dont give up on me otto
mountain i need two live leads
more people crowd in to look
clark the gennies a hundred yards away
ottos gonna have brain damage in about ninety seconds
he pulls the dogs lips back exposing its teeth and slobbered tongue
kiss of life
he sucks in a deep breath and starts mouth to mouthing the beast
we are looking out from inside a football helmet we hear the super present breathing of the helmets occupant
just over the breathing we can hear the muffled shouting of a snap count
we are in a crouch position looking downfield
at the call of hike
we and everyone on the field spring into action
we sprint downfield the breathing becoming even louder
a very big person downfield is sprinting toward us
after several yards still on the move we pan quickly around to look back for the quarterback
barely visible among converging bodies he is releasing the football toward someone else
easing up on the run we pan back around to look downfield just as the oncoming defender is upon us and crunch slams into us
a strobing pan leaves us looking up at the sky
our loud breathing has stopped
after a long beat the breathing resumes with a raggedy labored inhale
it continues irregularly
another helmeted player appears above us to peer down into our helmet
he extends a hand to help us up
we are looking back and forth around the circle at our gathered teammates
delta thirty seven
all with a simultaneous hand clap huh
lined up opposite us is a snarling defender
once again over loud breathing we can just hear the shouted count
we straighten to meet the defensive lineman lunging at us
his mouthpiece clatters against ours and in horrific close up he strains against us his animal gurgles of effort audible over our own ragged breath
with a primal roar from the defenseman our pov tips back and up booming down to stop with a crunch against the ground staring up
once again our breathing has stopped
after a beat a foot is planted on our helmet as a looming running back steps on us in his charge downfield
he is pursued by defenders some of whom leap over us and some of whom by the sound of it step on various body parts
the same back and forth pan
okay epsilon twenty two
you the man
this brings our wandering attention panning back to the quarterback you the man
a very very present voice hudson me the man
the same breathing and count
we sprint downfield
the same distant defender sprinting toward us
we hear low but very present a dismayed unh
our breathing is torn by rasping wheezes of effort as we continue to run
we look back
every player is looking directly at us
a huge spiralling football coming at us too close too soon and it bounces off our mouth guard and flies up
we are looking forward just as we are hit by the defender
we once again land face up
very steeply foreshortened right over us we see the defender juggling the live ball
with a moan our own hand reaches weakly up towards the ball and the high distant defender
he finally gathers in the ball and securely tucks it and starts back upfield
we climb wearily to our feet
we look back upfield just in time to see the defender start an elaborate victory dance in the end zone
he pauses for a moment to point a gloved hand directly at us then resumes his strut
shouting from the sidelines brings our panning attention over
the coach face twisted with fury is shouting at us and using his clipboard to wave us off the field
we trot toward the sidelines
all of our teammates stare at us some in shock some in anger some in pity
at the sideline bench our pov swings round as we seat ourself
a hand reaches up to the mouth guard to pull off the helmet and we our first objective shot as the player hudson finishes pulling off his helmet
he is a big blond boy
his entire body including his face is solidly built
an offscreen voice hudson
the boy hudson turns to look and we cut to one last the coach is striding up swinging his clipboard at the camera with a loud crunch
it brings on it is a typical sunbaked concrete strip mall with a seven eleven a launderette and a hi ho donut
the hi ho donut sign shows a pink donut with sprinkles and says in much smaller lettering and croissants
a beat up impala pulls into the lot pulsing hip hop music
after a long rumbling idle the ignition is killed
both front doors open
two black kids get out and look around with a manner that is if anything too casual
there is faint muzak and loud air conditioner hum
glass cases display donuts identified as glazed jelly and fancies
fancies ooze yellow goo
the jelly on the jelly donuts is developing a crust of age
the glazed also look moth eaten
one customer a disheveled older man sits at one of the little formica tables staring into a coffee cup
next to the coffee is a brown paper bag from which a straw protrudes
behind the counter is a middle aged vietnamese woman in a neat white blouse
the two youths enter pulling out enormous handguns from underneath their windbreakers
all right dragon lady give us all the fuckin money
the woman stares blankly
we want that donut money
yao gin nyap
a man appears from the kitchen in back
he is a middle aged vietnamese gentleman in a crisply pressed khaki leisure suit
an ascot is knotted at his neck
he wears aviator eyeglasses
in his mouth smolders a half burned down filterless cigarette
this we shall learn later is the general
okay papa san we want that donut money
and we aint fuckin around mr
the two youths look at her briefly
nothing else is forthcoming
the drunk looks up from his paper bag
look this fuckin thing it aint complicated
you give us all the fuckin money you dont get shot in the head you make more donuts get more money
thats how it works see
the general stares at him
as with his wife none of it seems to register unlike his wife he seems unperturbed
give us the money
he is pointing the gun directly at the generals head
you got three fuckin seconds
you understand one two three
im gonna count one two three and then shoot
three sec huh
the general has swung his fist up to hook two fingers inside the youths nostrils
his gun clatters to the floor
the fingers are way way up his nose
only one knuckle shows on each finger
the youth is staring cross eyed at his own nose
his friend is also stupefied
very nasal his fingers are way the fuck up my nose
the general still impassively sucks on his cigarette
the first youth is on the verge of tears i think theyre in my brain man
he raises his gun to start firing
as he does so the general uses his hook hold on the other youths nose to slam his head backwards down into some fancies
the door opens and a customer walks in a semi elderly lady with a cane
youth eyes rolling wildly swings to cover the door then back to the general who has his friends head pressed into the fancies then uncertainly over to the vietnamese woman
who is loudly yelling at him in vietnamese
cigarette still dangling from his lower lip the general calmly plucks a pot of coffee from the coffee warmer and tosses it into youth s face
the car is still pulsing hip hop music
youth stumbles out of the hi ho hands covering his face and sinks to his knees
the general now has the first youths face pressed into the fancies from behind
without disturbing his smoking the general repeatedly kicks the youth in the ass
his wife muttering irritably in vietnamese is wheeling a water bucket and mop to where the floor is covered with coffee
at the cut many voices are swelling in a song of worship
it is a black baptist church and the music has great energy
the white robed choir finishes singing a preacher takes the podium
i know you all remember that when moses came down the mountain carrying the word a god come down that sinai peak he caught those israelites red handed
what he catch em doin
he caught em worshipping a golden calf
shouts of thats right
he caught em with their backs turned on god
more shouts of thats right
he caught em worshipping a false god
a god of earthly things
he caught them israelites in decline
he caught em
because backslidin is decline brothers and sisters
you hear talk these days and i know youve heard this talk you hear talk of decline well all that means is we done turned our back on god
people say civilization doin this civilization doin that civilization in decline
well it aint no civilization
it aint no them
its us brothers and sisters
we are tracking among the congregants disproportionately women mostly of middle age and elderly mostly wearing elaborate go to church hats
its whats in our hearts each and every one of us when we like them israelites
slidin awa a a ay down that godly slope slippin and slidin toward the mire and muck a the stinkhole of greed thats thats decline
the continuing track brings us onto mrs
munson wearing like most of her peers an oversized hat hers is adorned with a great deal of plastic fruit
and what did moses do when he saw those declinin backslidin never mindin sinners
what he do
moses smote those sinners in his wrath yes he did
yes he did
yall know what smote is
we done smote
to smite is to go upside the head
because sometimes brothers and sisters that is the only way
yes it is
to smite is to remind
we got to stop that decline
and scramble back up to the face a the almighty gyod
stead a worshippin that golden calf that earthly trash on that garbage island
that garbage island in that shadowland way outside the kingdom a god
that garbage island where scavenger birds feast on the bones a the backslidin damned
yes they do
and so let us pray
it is a white clapboard country church
the preacher stands at the door chatting with the congregants filing out
you preach a wonderful sermon brother cleothus
why thank you sister rose
that man has a lot to say
yes he does
and every word of it the truth
jesus well pleased with him
deed he is
oh now ladies
pleased as he can be
oh now you gracious ladies
munson is at the kitchen table
she folds a five dollar bill into a sheet of paper raising her voice as she does so it was a good sermon
that man has a lot to say
we have cut to the portrait of othar over the mantel
he does not answer
from the kitchen stout too
it wouldve been a comfort to you
munson has stuffed the paper enclosed bill into an envelope which she is now laboriously addressing to bob jones university
and the choir was all in good voice
mm mm there is a knock at the door
who could that the cat yowls and hisses
munson swings open the door
dorr stands on the stoop mournfully dry washing his hands and obsequiously ducking his head
my dear mrs
munson i do so hope this is not an inopportune time for our first practice somebody die
i beg your oh
he looks back at the long black vintage lincoln hearse parked at the curb behind him
no no no bereavement though it is so kind of you to enquire
no the hearse is simply a vehicle commodious enough to accommodate all of the members of our ensemble
and of course our instruments contrived in an age ignorant of miniaturization
he turns and gestures at the vehicle
at his sign gawain the custodian emerges from the drivers side
clark pancake emerges from the front passenger side
the general wearing a different but equally pressed khaki suit and ascot and with a smoking cigarette in his lips emerges from a back door
gawain goes to the back of the hearse and opens its hatch to let out lump hudson the football player
lump helps unload five large and oddly shaped instrument cases each man taking one except for lump himself who carries two
as the parade of losers and misfits winds its way up the walk let me introduce you to my friends my colleagues these devoted and passionate musicians
this is gawain macsam our bassoonist
gawain nods as he passes by
general nguyen pham doc viola da gamba
no smoking in this house
the general tosses his cigarette away and bows stiffly as he passes
clark pancake a multi instrumentalist but with his remarkable embosser clark specializes in wind instruments and is especially accomplished on the french horn
he nods passes
and finally aloysius lump hudson
lump is our sackbuttist and thank you lump i see youve also brought my fiddle
as he hands dorr the violin case heres your fiddle doctor
munson sizes up the group
you aint gonna make a racket are ya
oh no no no no no
no we shall recuse ourselves to the basement where we shall be i think here the expression is uniquely appropriate
he gives a sickly smile
as quiet as the crypt
the general stands stock still his nose an inch away from the earthen wall studying it squinting through the smoke of the cigarette pinched between his lips
the rest of the men are opening their cases and taking out the instruments
gawains case contains however not a musical instrument but a boombox and several tapes
he loads one of the tapes into the machine
what do you think general
present any problems
after a beat the general turns away from the wall to give dorr a look into which one might read anything or nothing
gawain hits play on the boombox and the cellar is filled with the fussy strains of baroque chamber music
he spreads a map open on the sackbutt case
all right gentlemen why dont we all crowd around and go over the plan
the biggest feature on the map is a wavy roughly north south pair of lines a river
a boat icon sits at one edge and from it a dotted rectangle extends inland
dorr taps at the boat icon with his fiddle bow
this gentlemen is the lady luck gambling den cash cow sodom of the mississippi delta and the focus of our little exercise
here is orchard street
he is tracing a street that parallels the dotted rectangle extending from the boat
the street is lined by small house icons on either side the bow comes to rest on one of those icons
and here is the residence of marva munson the charming lady whom yall met moments ago
bow taps emphasize you
this brings us to this square
the bow indicates it and then withdraws
dorr uses the bow as a swagger stick to punctuate as he begins to pace
gentlemen i believe you are all aware that the solons of the state of mississippi to wit its legislature have decreed that no gaming establishment shall be erected within its
borders upon dry land
they may however legally float upon any watercourse defining a state boundary
but while the gambling activity itself is restricted to riverboats no such restriction applies to the functions ancillary to this cash besotted bidnis
the casinos offices locker rooms facilities to cook and clean and most importantly its counting houses the reinforced secret and super secure repositories of the lucre may all be situated
gawain where is wherever
dorrs smug smile fades
testily where is the money
end of every shift pit boss brings the cash down to the hold of the ship in the locked cash box once a day all the cash boxesre moved to
the counting room
and where is the counting room
in that square there
where you pointing
and what to flog a horse that if not at this point dead is in mortal danger of expirin does the dotted square represent
gawain hesitates the questions obviousness suggesting to him some trick
dorrs eyes close
a smile of feline contentment curls his lips
he murmurs underground
during the casinos hours of operation the door to the counting room is fiercely guarded and the door itself is of redoubtable pittsburgh steel when the casino is closed the
entire underground complex is locked up and the armed guard retreats to the casinos main entrance
there then far from the guard reposes the money cosseted behind a five inch thick steel portal yes but the walls gentlemen the walls of that room are but humble
masonry behind which is only the soft loamy soil deposited over the centuries by ol man the meanderin mississip as it fanned its way back and forth across this great alluvial plain
he has pried a fistfull of dirt from the cellar wall
he crumbles it letting it sift to the floor and then pleased with himself he smiles
lump looks around then hesitantly raises his hand
what does cosseted mean
once again dorrs smile fades
he does not dignify the question with answer
the general here whose curriculum vitae compahends massive tunneling experience thoo the soil of his native french indochina will direct our little ol tunnelin operation
the general acknowledges with a curt nod
clark pancake while a master of none is a jack of all those trades corollary to our aim
he will be doin such fabricatin and demolition work as our little caper shall require
clark acknowledges verbally happy to be on board
gawain is the proverbial inside man
he has managed to secure a berth on the custodial staff of the lady luck thereby placin himself in a position to perform certain chores whose precise nature neednt detain
us here but whose performance shall guide this expedition to its happy conclusion
ya damn skippy
and this brings us to lump
to look at lump you might wonder what function could he possibly fill what specialized expertise could he possibly offer to our merry little ol band a miscreants
well gentlemen in a project of such magnitude and such risks it is traditional nay it is imperative to enlist the services of a hooligan a goon an ape a
physical brute who will be our security our fist our batterin ram
lump is our blunt instrument and on all our behalfs i wish him a warm mississippi welcome
well gentlemen here you are men of different backgrounds and differing talents men with in fact only two things in common one you all saw fit to answer my little
advertisement in the memphis scimitar and two you are all going to be in consequence very very incredibly rich
let us revel in our adventure gentlemen
let us make beautiful music together
and above all gentlemen let us keep it to ourselves
what we say in this root cellar let it stay in this root cellar
theres no i in team
all stare at him
lump has a very excellent point
the music swells supported now by a male chorus that has the spirited manliness of the red army choir
we the men at work tunneling
the cat sits on the cellar floor head cocked gazing at the hole now opened in the wall
lump in a sleeveless undershirt glistening with sweat wields a pickaxe at the forward point
at the mouth of the hole clark pancake shovels dirt into a heavy plastic refuse bag held open by gawain
dorr sits on a camp chair one hand idly waving time to the music reading an old and yellowed tome with half glasses perched midway down his nose
the general hops nimbly out of the tunnel and unzips and steps out of his all in one to reveal underneath his neatly pressed leisure suit and ascot
later dorr stands at the head of the cellar stairs looking around the empty parlor
he gives a nod down the stairs and the men troop up past him carrying sacks of earth
over the mantelpiece the eternal flame of the devotional candle almost animating his features othar seems to watch the men as they cross to the front door
the men load the earth into the hearse
we are at the mississippi bridge that we saw in the prologue to the movie but now in dead of night deserted
the hearse is pulling up at the middle of the bridge and dimming its lights
the men emerge when they open the back of the hearse to pull out the sacks the cat bounds out to watch from a distance
we watch the men from high angled down along the masonry of a tower that stands in the middle of the suspension bridge
an ornamental gargoyle leers in the foreground
the garbage scow is approaching
we hear the low toot of its horn as it nears the bridge
lump is poised with the first sack hugged to his chest leaning over the railing
the nose of the barge enters below us
lump releases the sack
we watch it drop dead away like a bomb from an airplane
it thuds distantly onto the barge
the next sack has been passed up to lump and is released
the cat watches
its orange eyes blink
its pupils adjust
a pull back shows that the cat is in fact back in the basement
its pov continued tunneling
back to the cat watching then turning its head at a noise at the head of the stairs the cellar door is opening
a whistle from the general and lump and clark pancake scramble from the tunnel
they whip a curtain over its opening and all men grab up their instruments as dorr covering with a cough turns off the cd player
the general his ever present cigarette smoldering between his lips tongue and lips it up and backwards so that it is inside his mouth which he now closes
marva munson is heavily and carefully descending the stairs
as the men come into view they are looking up at her lump holding his sackbutt but still glistening with sweat and smeared with dirt
thats okay dont stop on account of me
lump looks around saucer eyed then blows gamely into his sackbutt
it sounds like goose farts until dorr waves him down
no no madam we were about to take a break anyway
the glissandi on this particular piece are technically very demanding and i think we would all welcome a moment of relaxation
i just thought you might like to see what a you gotten up to honey
why you sweatin like that
it is directed at lump who looks down at his own sweat stained undershirt
that man plays one bitch barrelful a sackbutt
aint no one can blow the tenor sackbutt like lump hoowee
goes at that thing like it was a pu uh like it was a woman
he she cuffs him on the head
i dont want that kind of talk in my home even in the root cellar
this is a christian house boy none of that hippity hop language
sadly gawain is given to whap
she slaps gawain again
sometimes its the only way
he untenses after what seemed like the final blow but whap
she slaps him again
im tryin to help you son
as well you should maam
but gawain at times is so far transported by his love of the music of the early renaissance as to dont make no never mind hes transported
dorr has her by the elbow and is ushering her back up the stairs
i understand your she pulls her elbow away and sniffs
you been smokin
certainly not madam
i understand your indignation
and i was offering explanation not excuse
i myself am offended by those who cannot find the proper words to express themselves and have recourse to gawain calls up the stairs dont you be explainin me dawg
you cant look into my mind cape man
dorrs tone is soothing as he shuts the door at the top of the stairs
a fiery lad
but then youth is fiery
a fact often remarked upon by the poets of the romantic era
my youth i was in church i wasnt walkin around fiery
youth aint no excuse for nothin
only came down to show you the fife
she hands him a thick roughly whittled piece of cane
dorr holds it looks at it dumbly
he is for the first time that we have seen anyway non plussed
he burned his own
dorr tries to summon conversation as the two sit with their backs to the fireplace did he
i thought maybe bein a musical man youd be interested
oh i am indeed cut it himself and burned the holes
israelites called it a kalil
kalil fife same thing
you can read about it in the bible
aint nothin new under the sun
gone these twenty years
he was some kind of man
from othars pov slightly high we see them both twist in their chairs to look up at the portrait
reverse of the portrait low angle
othar looks down at us with what appears to be bemusement
marva munson and dorr gaze up at the portrait for a motionless beat
at length marva munson sighs blowed the kalil
dorrs eyes remain on the picture as he inquires i dont suppose othar ever turned his hand or uh heh heh heh turned his lip to the shofar
prompted by her silence he adds the ceremonial rams horn sounded by the priests of the hebrews
i dont know nothin bout that
othar didnt study no shofar to the extent a my knowledge
the kalil was good enough for my othar
she gazes at the portrait
some kind of man
following a woman in a red dress
hey baby dont be cruel
jus sneak one little peek
the woman looks back over her shoulder smiling as she continues to walk
dont let this uniform fool ya leads gawain macsam pushing his wheeled trash bin
you dont need to be gamblin honey you lookin at a sure thing
they call me mr
baby cause thats how i measure up
i am the original black jack honey accept no substitutions
you can pull my lever all day long sweet mama i aint never gonna come up lemons
thats right sugar you can blow on my dice any ol time
gudge has his feet up on the desk and is filing his nails with an emery board
gudge she had an ass that could pull a bus
this lady was fine fine dandy divine
i dont care how big her ass was macsam
there is no fraternizing with customers on the lady luck
clean out your locker
but gudge get out of here
you cant fire me
i sue your ass

ya damn skippy
i know you firin my ass cause im black
everyone on the custodial staff is black macsam
your replacements gonna be black
his replacement will no doubt be black
fuckin judge is gonna be black motherfucker thats who gonna be black
you gonna stand tall before the man
we are looking down past the distinctive pylon mounted yellow letters waffle
the band of miscreants is seated around a table with cups of coffee
dorrs wardrobe makes no concession to the informality of the setting he still wears his cape and a black string tie
his manner is more mournful even than usual oh my
oh my my my my my
this is a severe setback
i am distraught
i am more than distraught i am devastated
oh my this is quite the monkey wrench heaved into the meticulously engineered construct of our little escapade
yeah it fucks things up
i am beside myself
i am at a positive loss for words
you still talkin okay though
have you all decided
dorrs intensely mournful agitation is brought to bear upon her oh madam we must have waffles
we must all have waffles forthwith
they hand in their menus
oh we must think
we must all have waffles and think each and every one of us to the very best of his ability
perhaps if you apologized to the man and gave him flowers or perhaps a fruit basket with a card depicting a misty seascape and inscribed with a sentiment
shit man it aint about apologizin
he fired me cause im black
he cant do that
you could sue him
open and shut case
this is not
mans a fuckin bigot
well then perhaps surely a chocolate assortment has been known to warm the heart of even the most hardened misanthrope especially if its a premium chocolate imported say from switzerland
or the netherlands or some other of the so called low countries be they dutch or flemish or walloon walloon my ass the man aint gonna roll over for a fuckin candy bar
im afraid theres a setback on the tunneling front too
weve run into a pretty large rock and rock
all turn to look at the general
he continues to stare at a spot in space
he slowly releases some inhaled cigarette smoke murmuring very bad
oh my my it seems that the poet was right troubles never singly come
oh we can get through the rock no worries there
simplest thing in the world
why we blow right through it ive got a pyro license we bore a hole in the rock pack in a little plastique igneous blows pretty good and we is
he gonna want a piece of the action
all turn to look at lump
lump hesitates looking at the inquiring faces that surround him
a female voice hello clark
am i ordering the prima cord
the men look up at her
yes mountain we were just talking about that and some plastique
all the men are staring at her agog
the fuck is this
this is mountain girl
mountain is my right hand
she helps me with ordnance
helps me with damn near everything
the men stare
you brought your bitch to the waffle house
there is tension in the air
dorr clears his throat
i confess myself to be puzzled as well
i thought we all understood that so far as our little enterprise is concerned mum as the saying would have it is the word of course
i understand that
but this is mountain
i dont keep secrets from mountain
thats not how you maintain a loving caring relationship
you brought your bitch to the waffle house
he looks around
man brings his bitch to the waffle house
look you ill thank you to stop referring to mountain that way
shes the other half of my life
everybody lookin at me like im a fuck up losin that sorry ass job and this motherfucker bring his bitch to the waffle house
pancake lunges across the table sending dishes clattering to the floor as he grabs gawain by the shirt
you son of a bitch punk
shut your goddamn mouth
he shakes him vigorously and rears back to take a swing at him
gawain draws a gun
come and get me motherfuck
come on baby lets get it on
mountain starts screaming
people look aghast
the other men pry pancake and gawain apart
gentlemen this sort of behavior does you no credit in the eyes of your colleagues or in those of the other patrons of this waffle house
pancake grumbles as he composes himself and straighten his clothes
nobody talks to mountain girl that way
she had an abusive family
fuck you man
i got syrup on my safari jacket
he embraces mountain who continues to sob quietly
gentlemen i propose that we consider the matter of this woman mountain water to be mountain girl
i am so very sorry
i propose that we consider this matter to be closed and we shall chose to trust her since we now have no choice and since she shall share only in
pancakes portion of the booty
over the shoulder of the quietly weeping mountain girl of course
wouldnt have it any other way
damn right you wont
up yours punk
and the manner of disposing of our igneous impediment is also settled
that leaves only the question of gawain retrieving his job
couldnt you just bribe the guy
all turn to look at lump
othar looks serenely down from his spot over the mantelpiece
marva munson knits g
dorr sits nodding over an ancient volume of half forgotten lore reading glasses perched midway down his nose
curtains waft lazily in the summer night breeze
you just a readin fool aint you mr
yes yes i must confess madam that often i feel more at home in these ancient volumes than i do in the hustle bustle of our modern world
to me paradoxically the literature of the so called dead tongues has more currency than this mornins newspaper
in these books
he removes his glasses and lazily twirls them
in these volumes there is the accumlated wisdom a mankind which succours me when the day is hard or the night lonely and long
wisdom of mankind what about the wisdom of the lord
oh yes the good book mm
i have found reward in its pages
but for me there are other good books as well the heavy volumes of antiquity freighted with the insights of mans glorious age
and then of course i love love love the works of mr
ed gallan poe
i know who he is
oh no madam noooo
not of this world true he lived in a dream an ancient dream
dorr himself is lost in a dream helen they beauty is to me like those nicean barks a yore that gently oer a perfumed sea the weary wayworn wanderer bore
to his own native shore
who was helen
she wasnt a loose woman was she
some kinda whore a babylon
dorr is still lost one doesnt know who helen was though i picture her as bein very very extremely
he comes to himself focuses on mrs
miz munson i was tryin to think of some way of expressin my gratitude to you for takin in
this weary wayworn wanderer
the professor takes a small ticket envelope from where it had served as bookmark and hands it across
its just a modest little ol present why its practically nothing at all
beaming she takes two tickets out of the envelope and inspects them
dorr why you are such a gallant man
oh no madam i blush
no i just happened to hear of this gospel concert tomorrow night the mighty mighty clouds of joy and i thought you and a friend from church perhaps
othar loved that music
yes i got a widow lady friend
the concert is up in memphis but i have arranged for a car service to transport you thither and needless to say back home at the concerts termination
my friends and i will be rehearsing here tomorrow evening so you neednt worry about the security of your charming little old house
there is a knock at the door
munson swings the door open to sheriff wyner
his squad car is parked at the curb
sheriff wyner how you doin
the professors eyes widen with concern as he hears the voices off evenin miz munson i just came by
the sheriff is tipping his hat and already backing away trying to make his visit brief to let you know i had a word with weemack
he says he gonna comply with your request keep the music down and neighborly
he calls from the bottom of the stoop so you have a pleasant evening now and just let us know hang on there sheriff somebody i want you to meet
maam im a little pressed for time why you chasin a gang of bank robbers
get on in here say hello
the voices approach we was just havin tea talkin about othar the two enter and mrs
munson stops short looking
the living room is empty
even the professors teacup is gone
bussed his own dishes
you can always tell a gentleman
the sheriff hat in hand gazes about
someone was here maam
mm hm with men othar
once again he tries to excuse himself well maybe ill catch him next time
come on up to his room
the door opens and the two look in
the neatly made bed next to the small barren dresser
mm hes neat
probably went down to the cellar to play with his friends
maam i really have to
top teased by a dust ruffle in the foreground we see mrs
munsons heavy orthopedic shoes turning to pass sheriff wyners shiny black boots
shows dorr cheek pressed to the floor his teacup and saucer under the bed with him
be gettin back
munson is about to go out the door but notices something a corner of the professors cape protruding from under the end of the bed
the heavy orthopedic shoes approach and then with loud mr
mogul sounds of effort mrs
munsons hands and knees hit the floor
her head drops in to view to peer in her own cheek against the floorboards
we see the sheriff watching and his high pov of mrs
munsons enormous ass
what you doin havin tea down there
dorr makes silent hand waves to disavow his own presence
munson roars with laughter
with difficulty she pushes herself back upright still laughing
land of goshen
get out from under there
miz munson my pager just went off
why of all the
the sheriff is already backing down the stairs fraid i gotta respond
he opens the front door and calls up ill try to meet your friend some other time
dorr shimmies out from under the bed
well that was very
as you know
he gets to his feet slaps dust from the front of his pants
we academics are inordinately fond of wedgin ourselves into confined spaces
at yale the students will see how many of their number they can enclose in a telephone booth harvard a broom closet
why i never
there was the goldfish swallowin craze of course a different but related phenomenon
i hope i didnt spill any tea
the box is being pulled open
what the hell is this
shows gawain in mr
gudges office as gudge behind the desk looks at the gift wrapped box
its just my way of sayin well goddamnit i dont know what its like walkin in your shoes bein all tightass and all and you dont know what its like
to walk in my shoes but well
gudge is opening a card that was inside the box
its floral front says in gold script im sorry
if i hurt your feelings
you know theres the custodian and then theres the man inside the custodian yunderstand what im sayin
gudge opens the card
inside is a hundred dollar bill
and that man has needs dig and i guess those needs mr
gudge which they usually involve women with big asses well those motherfuckin needs sometimes well up over the custodian like the motherfuckin johnstown flood
but my point is it aint gonna happen again
not if its humanly possible
gudge reads the card flips it over to look at its back
but jesus if youd seen the ass on that girl mr
gudge youd a wanted her sitting on your face too
well were all human
ya damn skippy
this apology buys you a one week probationary period
stay away from the customers macsam
pancake is on his stomach wearing goggles boring a hole into a rock face with a power drill
we hear the whine of the drill faintly here all but covered by the sound of the chamber music on the boom box
the other men sit around
dorr gives a casual glance at his watch as the whine subsides
pancake emerges from the tunnel covered with grime
the drill bits getting awfully hot
gawain maybe you could fill a hudson sprayer and spritz it down while i drill
fuck you man i aint your house nigger
im the inside man
look are you gonna have a bug up your ass for the rest of the time we work together
ill get the sprayer
no no me and this gentleman here have to get square
let me tell you something macsam
you wanna know something
i dont wanna know shit from you
pancake leans against the wall and pushes his goggles up on his forehead leaving raccoon eyes
im gonna tell you how i came down to mississippi
wasnt born here you know
im from scranton pennsylvania
abruptly he stares off into space
pancakes eyes regain their focus scranton pennsylvania
came down here in
with the freedom riders
you know who the freedom riders were macsam
i dont give a shit who they were
just tell me when they gonna leave
the freedom riders my fine young man were a group of concerned liberals from up north whites negros and yes jewish people all working together just like we are here
concerned citizens who came down here so that local black people could have their civil liberties
so that people like you could have the vote
all look at pancake
quiet except for the delicate chamber music
gawains tone softens you know what man
i dont vote
so fuck you
pancake darkens why you fucking and the bus you rode in on
he peels off his coat
lets step outside macsam
there is a knock on the cellar door
the men freeze momentarily then scramble for their instruments
the general flips his cigarette backwards into his mouth
dorr turns off the boom box then calls yes madam
the door opens and mrs
munson comes down the stairs holding a large plate covered by a checked napkin
my friend mrs
funthes is here so im about to go on out
i just wanted to leave yall with some cinnamon cookies
she takes the napkin off and carries the plate from person to person each obediently takes a cookie with a murmured thank you maam
yall sound pretty good
itd be nice if youd come by the church some day give us a recital
dorr takes her by the arm and escorts her back to the stairs
oh madam you are too kind
our music however is how shall i put it
rather roman in its outlook many of our pieces were commissioned by the holy see
oh i see all right but we dont make a big whoop dee do about denominations everybody welcome at our church
weve had methodists come in
even had a jew come in once with a guitar back in the sixties
excuse me one moment maam and i shall see you off
they have reached the top of the stairs and the professor ushers her out but stays behind himself
he turns to address the rest of the men below if you gentlemen can labor harmoniously in the course of my absence then perhaps upon my return we shall be
prepared to explode that vexin ol piece a igneous
hes the motherfuckin piece of igneous
the professor emerges from the cellar
munson awaits with her friend who is likewise togged out in fancy sunday dress and carrying a shiny black purse
professor this is rosalie funthes rosalie professor g
oh my thats an awful lot of letters
well of course in my youth i was simply known as goldthwait
pancake is taking the boom box off the table to clear some space
all right safety meeting lets listen up
general could you hand me the prima cord and the compound there
before we set the charge well run through our procedure
various paraphernalia are laid out on the table
the cat sits in a corner of the cellar watching carefully and it seems listening attentively
i have earplugs for whoever wants them
just wedge them in your ears
now here we have not yet lump
lump stops putting in his earplugs
time comes we pack the hole in the rock with the c and insert two leads
he holds up one lead
he holds up the other lead
charge comes from a battery that is inside this plunger
ordinary auto battery you can pick it up at sears easiest thing in the world
a black town car idles at the curb
dorr is just escorting the two ladies out the front door and down the stoop
i remember my father telling me and it is one of the few memories i retain of the man from one of his visits home and how i do cherish
it he said goldthwait you are not formed as other little boys
he a man of learnin
number two was self educated he had no career as such though the state recognized the breadth of his readin by making him librarian at the state nervous hospital in
meridian where he was a distinguished inmate
pancake sets down the two electrical leads and picks up a hammer
this is the same procedure we will be using when we collapse the tunnel after entering the casino vault and returning to the root cellar
he looks pointedly at gawain
this is for your own protection so pay close attention
once these materials are combined only the professionals may handle them
that means me or the general
separately they are harmless completely inert
why you could light this stuff on fire hit it with a hammer he swings the hammer down onto the plastique and there is the dull thud of an explosion
and the houses windows rattle in their frames
the professor at the open door of the car into which the two ladies have just sat looks up at the house as do the ladies
what in the name of heaven was that
dorr stares at the house appalled
that there is
no cause for alarm
he struggles for self possession
why im not even absolutely certain that i heard anything at all
didnt hear anything
well something perhaps but
marva munson starts to get out of the car
nothing that need discompose us was the sense i was trying to convey
he urges her back into her seat
miz munson i will not have you missing your musical recital
why you go ahead now
miz funthes you as well i beg of you
he is backing up the walk
i shall call the gas company or the water company or whatever subterranean utility is implicated in this little
i shall see to the matter
as only a highly educated classicist could
at the door now he gives the two women peering out the car window a smiling but vigorous wave away which they do not heed and then he enters
the room is filled with smoke
othar slightly askew over the mantel looks a little huffy
we hear clomping and screaming on the cellar stairs
lump bursts out shrieking blood professor
oh my god
the general comes bounding up the stairs like a panther a cigarette burning in his lips
he lands catlike in the living room glides to the blubbering lump grabs one shoulder firmly with one hand and with the other slaps him sharply once forehand once backhand
lump stares at him shocked his blubbering cut short
more noise is coming from the stairs why its nothing to make a fuss about
perfectly all right
happens all the time
you gotta go find it dipshit
pancake emerges from the stairwell his hair singed his face and the front of his jumpsuit darkened by the blast
he is clutching one hand with the other
really im perfectly all right
gawain has ascended just behind to hector him over his shoulder perfectly all right
you just blew your fucking finger off
sure but well get back down there and find it man
i aint pickin up your goddamn finger
i gather there was a premature detonation they can sew that shit back on jack
like that guy his wife cut his dick off
just sewed that motherfucker back on
simplest thing in the world
microsurgery saw that motherfucker in a porno
thing still works
pancake is pale from loss of blood and his pontifications lack full conviction oh yes they have remarkable abilities in the uh
the two women sit in the idling car looking at the house
from the house there is very muted bellowing
still looking toward the house mrs
munson offers a word of explanation to her friend they using the house to practice music a the rococo
the cat with a human finger in its mouth sidles cautiously to one side warily eying someone
the general pluming cigarette in his mouth tensed arms extended outwards sidles cautiously to cut him off
i propose that we get our fallen comrade to the hospital and the general shall follow when he manages to recover the severed digit
i dont know what all the fuss is about
the cat jumps
the general leaps to follow
the two women looking
the front door of the house opens
lump the professor and gawain emerge escorting pancake
just before gawain finishes closing the door the cat slips out
the door is yanked fully open and the general races out after the cat
you catch pickles now
the cat races across the lawn and with no break in stride up his favorite tree
the general follows and also without breaking stride clambers up the tree after it
tree limbs shake with activity hidden by the leaves
we hear the hiss of the cat
the men are bundling pancake into the hearse
dorr calls to the women before climbing in the house is perfectly in order but we need medical attention for mr
pancake who during the disturbance pinched his finger in a valve of the sackbutt
the cat leaps out of the tree and runs away down the road
you let the cat out
the general leaps out of the tree to land catlike on the street arms tensed casts a look both ways and then pursues the animal down the road
we hear the retreating padding footsteps of all six feet
the general is even now exercising every effort to retrieve your mischievous little pet
please go go and enjoy your concert and we shall see you later in the evening
au revoir mes dames
a new day
the garbage scow chugs down the mighty mississippi
it toots its horn
it shows the underground complex and stretching towards it in a line drawn with a blunt pencil is the tunnel
it is now almost to the vault
a violin bow enters to tap at the line
despite our little setback we find ourselves on schedule to penetrate the vault
the bow taps at the vault outline
here this afternoon having successfully blasted that little ol rock to pieces during miz munsons choir practice
the violin bow withdraws
clark perhaps you can run us through the game plan for what remains of our tunnelin
a bandaged hand enters frame and a finger stump points at the end of the penciled line
why its childs play now easiest thing in the world
only a couple of feet separate us from the vault
the men are clustered around the map spread out on the sackbutt case in the cellar
clark continues just the usual spadework until we hit the masonry of the vault and then we drill through
and will you be able to wield the drill with your maimed extremity
oh i should think so its only one finger
inhibits me in doing finer work of course
ill always have to live with that
maybe and im just thinking out loud here maybe since as you say it will present problems later
well maybe and this is something ive talked over with mountain girl and she agrees with me so its not just one persons opinion maybe i should get a little
extra compensation for the accident
a long stony silence
somewhat larger share
why if this were any other line of work id be getting workmens comp wouldnt i
might even have a pretty good lawsuit
you gonna sue yaself for blowin off your finger
well that is simply asinine yes but you see clark this is not what you just called some other line of work
but if it were this is a criminal enterprise not to put too fine a point on it entailin all manner a risks not involved in honest labor
governmental regulations an civic safeguards cannot be assumed to apply to antisocial pursuits
yeah but he lost his finger
we dont give a shit
man can blow his own dick off dont make no nevermind to us
we dont gotta pay the man for goin around blowin off body parts
getcha head outcha ass man
look you i think that in this instance gawain has a very excellent point
i no extra share
all stop and stare at the general
clark grumbles well okay majority rules like i say it was just a trial balloon
hands not so bad really i even get some phantom feeling
you pull on your prick you get phantom feeling
now that that matter is settled let us synchronize our watches before gawain reports to work
it will be twelve sixteen exactly
it will be twelve fifteen
no in fifteen seconds now eleven seconds it will be twelve sixteen
five yes lump
i dont have a watch
it is the weathered doorway to the main entrance of the lady luck
a hand enters to rap
a low chesty chuckle
the door swings open and gawain enters
a garbage bin is being wheeled across the empty casino floor
gawain is wheeling it
he is approaching the tunnel to the corporate annex
as they roll down the tunnel
loud singing at the cut
we are looking at mrs
munson in the middle of the choir holding forth in song
gawain leans back against the wall next to the vault door arms folded across his chest
faintly from inside the vault we hear the whine of a power tool
gawain leans over and punches the button on boom box that hangs from the rolling garbage bin
the hallway pulses with i left my wallet in el segundo
more singing mrs
munson and the rest of the choir now clapping as they sing
the power tool whine is louder here
we are looking at a patch of wall
after a beat and with a loud rev as resistance gives way a drill bit emerges from the wall spitting out bits of the masonry
the drill withdraws
after a beat hammer blows
the chunk of masonry begins to buckle
the general opens the door still somehow immaculately groomed
the gospel number rising to climax supported by the organist and the rest of the congregation
clark and lump covered in dirt and plaster dust have started stuffing bundled bills and small sacks into large garbage bags
an irregular hole about three feet across gapes in the far wall
gawain punches off the boombox looking at all the money
well aint that somethin
clark suddenly freezes in the act of collecting money
he straightens slowly
he stands stock still wincing gazing off into space
he whispers hoarsely urgently the other men look at him
irritable bowel syndrome
is there a mens room down here
oh man you shouldnt be using the mens room or a ladys room
you shoulda shit back in the house man
we dont want elron finding you in the goddamn crapper
clarks voice is still hoarse
he does small knee bends of urgency no choice
its a medical condition
you are disgusting man
all right follow me
we are close on gawain peering anxiously to one side
he turns and peers the other way
we hear a toilet flush and after a beat clark emerges from the mens room door next to which gawain stands
his manner is now completely relaxed
feel thirty pounds lighter
they start walking back to the vault
thank you for being so understanding
not everyone is of course which is why the biggest challenge of ibs is educating the public
afflicts over two million people yet most of us have never heard of it
and it strikes without regard to age gender or race
oh fuck man i dont wanna know about it
thats the kind of attitude were fighting
well maybe you should sign me up man cause you startin to irritate my bowel
the choir finishes a number and sits all except for marva munson who unties the knot on her robe at the nape of her neck slips it off and with
murmured goodbyes slips away
as the two men enter clark is still holding forth i guess i never told you thats how mountain girl and i met
they had an ibs weekend at grossingers in the catskills
of course the tourist business up there has suffered with the demise of the borscht belt
so they have different promotions mixers so on
this was a weekend for irritable bowel singles to meet and support each other and share stories
man i dont wanna hear a single one a them stories
well some of them are very not one fuckin story
you one fucked up motherfucker
you they stop short looking the general and lump are standing in the middle of the floor stock still each clutching a bag of money staring up at the same
corner of the ceiling
lump turns to clark and gawain
hey lookit that
gawain and clark join them in the middle of the vault and look up at the corner of the ceiling
a small video camera aimed squarely at the four men
black and white video very wide angle high shot of the four motionless men below goggling up at the lens
smoke plumes from the generals cigarette
looks like an ikegami
he slips on his reading glasses as he gets a leg up on a shelf just below the camera and hoists himself
he peers in at the lens
clark looming into extreme close shot
im not sure whether its broadcasting
he is fingering the back of the camera
down below gawain looks at the wire snaking along the seam of wall and ceiling
at the opposite corner it travels down the joint of the two walls
he traces its path down and then across one wall at chair rail height towards the door
the other men follow in an anxious herd as he traces one finger along it
just before reaching the vault door the wire goes through the wall in a hole finished off with a grommet
gawain goes out the vault door
and picks up the line where it emerges on the other side travels down to the joint of wall and floor and then continues along the floor
gawain follows it and the other men continue to follow him
he traces it anxiously down the hall in a hunched lope
the other men scuttle behind into
the wire winds around into the room back up to chair rail height along one wall behind some cabinetry which gawain hurries past to find it again on the far
side and then down to a video recorder
it is not however hooked up to the video recorder its pronged end swings loose just by where it would be plugged in
inside the video recorder is a casette which gawain ejects
the men crowd to look over his shoulder as he examines it shevanns schvanz
there is a pile of other videos by the monitor charlayne and the chocolate factory big dick blaques big night out lemme tell ya bout black chicks anus andy
just next to the pile is an old bowl of kocoa krispies
the general climbs into the tunnel with a garbage bagful of money followed by lump likewise encumbered
lump hands back out a satchel to gawain who sets it on the vault floor by the hole
from the way he handles it it is quite heavy
pancake also with a bag of money is getting ready to climb in look i didnt choose to have ibs shut the fuck up
lump hands gawain a smaller lighter satchel which he likewise sets on the floor
theres no cure you know
not complaining just fact
and i did meet mountain
grab your bag and get in that fucking hole
munson is leaving with singing still audible from the service that continues inside
we are looking from inside the tunnel towards its mouth where the professor stoops slightly to peer in anxiously dry washing his hands
a reverse shows the hunched over men scuttling along the tunnel towards us holding large garbage sacks
welcome back gentlemen mission accomplished i see
i am so very very delighted
he gives a hand down to each man as he exits the tunnel
i have some cold duck on ice for the occasion
maybe we could have something to drink too
gawain left behind is muttering to himself as he uses a trowel and other instruments from his satchel to patch up the hole at his end of the tunnel
motherfucker cant stop talking cant stop shitting
motherfucker tell everyone about his motherfuckin asshole
no one gives a shit about his asshole
nobody interested in another mans asshole
or his bitchs
munson is letting herself in
the men are sitting around the table champagne glasses raised
on the table sits the money stacked in orderly piles
gentlemen to we few
we who have shared each others company each others care each others joy and who now reap the fruits of our communal effits shoulder to shoulder from each accordin to
his abilities so forth whatnot
we have had our little diffences along the way its true but i like to think they have only made us value one another the more each coming to understand
and appreciate the others unique qualities potencies and yes foibles
i suggest that we shall look back upon this caper one day one distant day grandchildren dandled upon our knee and perhaps a tear will form and we shall say
well with wit and grit and no small amount of courage we accomplished something on that day a feat of derring do an enterprise not ignoble we merry band unbound by the constraints of society and the prejudices of the common ruck we happy few
gentlemen to us
munson runs water into a teapot humming to herself
having finished patching gawain starts painting
he turns on his boombox and out comes the big bassy i left my wallet in el segundo
the men having drunk deep are setting down their glasses
pancake looks at his watch with some concern
charge shouldve gone off already
i do beg your pardon
the charge to collapse the tunnel
i set it for eight minutes
dorr looks at his watch
well that time and more has most certainly elapsed
looking toward the mouth
the men stoop over and peek fearfully in
they again stand upright
dorr clears his throat
i need not remind you of the importance of obliterating any trace of a connection between the vault and this house
it was of the essence of this plan that it should appear that the money had simply vanished
without a trace
spirited away as it were by ghosts
the conundrum of the undisturbed yet empty vault the unsolvable riddle of the sealed yet violated sanctum is of the utmost importance not only to make our caper innelectually satisfying
it is also exigent as a matter of practical fact i remind you that if a tunnel is ever found leading to this house this houses owner knows all of
she certainly does
therefore to draw the unavoidable conclusion someone shall have to reenter the tunnel to reset that charge
pancake hunched over scurries along the tunnel
he reaches the remnants of a large rock where the tunnel grows smaller
he drops to crawl position and elbows his way forward toolbelt clanking along
we are getting closer and closer to a muffled but thuddingly bassy i left my wallet in el segundo
the music loudly present at the cut
gawain takes a handheld blowdryer out of his satchel and flips it on directing it at the fresh paint on the wall whose repairs are now invisible
music once again muffled
pancake has reached a little led displaying timer with leads trailing off of it
he grabs it puts on his reading glasses squints
the display shows time remaining
the colons in the display rhythmically blink but the number does not advance
for some reason stuck
he reaches to his tool belt pulls out his leatherman
munson is setting places at a large table
there are about a dozen place settings
pancake now has a mini mag light clenched between his teeth aimed down at the timer
he opens the phillips head on his leatherman but abruptly stops and stares off into space
he is squinting with pain
the muffled hip hop song is beginning to recede
gawain is wheeling his garbage cart out the door
the vault is completely empty but looks completely undisturbed
he closes the heavy vault door behind him leaving quiet
quiet here as well now
pancakes moan trails off to nothing
the moment whatever it was has passed
he looks back down at the unit flicks it with his finger and it emits a soft beep
he squints at the back of the unit
as it beeps again he turns the unit over to look at its face
the readout now says
as he watches peering down through the bottom of his glasses it continues to advance with a beep as each second slips by
what the his eyes widen and he frantically shakes the unit
it continues beeping
he briefly and sloppily tries to fit the phillips head into one of the four screws on the back of the unit but immediately gives up and starts a panicked
wriggle back up the tunnel whimpering
gawain is wheeling his garbage cart past elron
munson is placing the last piece of silverware just so
pancake is in full panicked awkward flight as boom
we cut to the cellar and pancake is shot out the tunnel like a human cannonball trailing a comet tail of dirt dust and debris that wafts what were neatly
stacked bills up into the air
the portrait of othar jostles back to square
he now looks a little angry
the cat arches her back emitting a startled yowl
munson stands frozen then looks slowly around trying to assimilate what has just happened
gawain and elron are staring at each other frozen also reacting to what just happened
finally you just fart
heh heh heh
munson is looking at the cellar door
dust drifts out from under it
she takes a slow step towards it
she opens the door
there is no visibility in the cellar due to swirling clay dust
she takes one step down the stairs waving at the air in front of her face
paper money wafts in and out of the dust
we hear voices perfectly all right
not a problem
well there sure as shit aint no tunnel left
the clearing dust reveals the caped professor anxiously dancing from foot to foot gathering money out of the air
as he reaches up to grab a bill that has him facing up in mrs
munsons direction he freezes
his pov reveals her through dissipating dust
professor im surprised
there is a long beat through which all stare at her
properly speaking madam we have been surprised you are taken aback
though i acknowledge that the sense you intend is gaining currency through increasing use
further dissipation of the dust reveals how much money there is settling now to cover the floor of the cellar
you have returned from your devotions betimes
we hear the ring of the doorbell
i hadda fix tea
i wanna talk to you professor dont you be leavin
and dont make any more noise
she points at the general who in the excitement has neglected to hide his ever present cigarette
i told you i dont want any smokin in here
she clomps upstairs and shuts the cellar door
we pull her towards the front door angry and lost in thought
her look softens somewhat as she opens the door
it is a chattering infestation of hens all of her friends from church push in wearing church dresses and elaborate hats
the men are still frozen looking up toward the door
the muted cackle of church ladies
the men gradually unfreeze
she saw everything
she saw our hole
he turns to dorr near tears she saw our hole professor
dorr rubs his hands anxiously thinking yes
what do we do
well first my dear boy we follow the generals example
the general remains staring up at the door frozen but for the smoke pluming from the cigarette in his mouth
and refrain from panic
secondly we cooly calmly collectedly think
the gaze of all the men drifts back up to the cellar door and we look down at them gazing up
the chattering ladies are gathered at the table mrs
munson pouring them tea
the cellar door creaks noisily one might almost say gothically ajar and the professor peers out with an ingratiating smile
the chattering abates and the ladies all look at him
his smile broadens into ghastliness and he crooks a finger toward mrs
munson if i might have a word
you get back down those stairs
i assure you i shall be hush
down those stairs
we havin tea now
i be down shortly
he nods meekly and retreats easing the door creakily shut
the ladies look inquisitively at mrs
munson as his footsteps are heard descending the stair
hes the tenant
as the professor rejoins the still staring and silent group
the money has been picked up and is once again in stacks upon the table
she shall be down shortly
explaining he indicates upstairs with a jerk of the head tea
the men nod murmuring
the cellar door squeaks open
there is the clomp of careful footsteps on the stair
using only tongue and teeth the general flips his smoking cigarette inwards into his mouth and gives mrs
munson his usual deadpan look
she halts halfway down the stairs still wearing an apron and holding a spatula
i dont know what you boys been up to but i wasnt born yesterday and i know mischief when i see it
now i want an explanation but first i want you boys to get your fannies up here with yalls period instruments
i been tellin the ladies about your music and they wanna hear you play
she turns to head back up the stairs but abruptly stops to turn and give the general a hard look which he innocently returns
she turns again and clomps back up the stairs
the general opens his mouth and again without using his hands restores his cigarette to its usual place on his lower lip
lump is fretful professor
i cant really play the buttsack
the cellar door opens and the men troop out g
dorr leading and the other men following rather sheepishly behind
madame or rather mesdames you will have to accept our apologies for failing to perform since as you see we are shorthanded
gawain is still at work and we could no more play with one part tacit than a horse could canter shy one leg
perhaps i could offer as a poor but ready substitute a brief poetic recital
though i dont pretend to great oratorical skills i will happily present with your ladies permission verse from the unquiet mind of mr
ed gallan poe
lump pancake and the general sit and awkwardly accept dainty teacups
the professor rises spreads his hand and pronounces ladies thy beauty is to me like those nicean barks of yore
close ups of the various ladies some sipping tea or slowly munching biscuits but all eyes glued to the declaiming man in the cape
that gently oer a perfumed sea the weary wayworn wanderer bore to his own native shore
murmuring voice amen
a slurp of tea from another quarter
dorr bears on on desperate seas long wont to roam thy hyacinth hair thy classic face thy naiad airs have brought me home to the glory that was greece and
the grandeur that was rome
a long silence
then scattered mm mm
a lady holding a teacup turns to the general that was soooome poem
the general stares at her
you know any
we hear the front door opening and gawain enters still wearing his lady luck custodial uniform
his pov church ladies with teacups and his comrades seated among them also holding teacups and scones
yall been celebratin
the bustling and chattering ladies are just finishing leaving mrs
munson is seeing them off at the door
evening is gathering and we hear the lonely toot of the distant garbage scow
the men as well stand by the door and affecting good cheer wave off the departing ladies
we had such a pleasant time
munson closes the door and her manner instantly darkens
now i wanna know whats goin on
yes indeed and the thirst for knowledge is a very commendable thing
though in this instance i believe when you hear the explanation you will laugh riotously slappin your knee and perhaps even wipin away a giddy tear relieved of your former
you see lump here is an enthusiastic collector of indian arrowheads and having found one simply lying on your cellar floor a particularly rare artifact of the natchez tribe he
enlisted us in an all out effort to sift through the subsoil in search of others
well in doing so we apparently hit a motherlode of natural gas i myself became acutely aware of the smell of rotten eggs and it was at just this unfortunate
moment that the general here violated one of the cardinal rules of this house and lit himself a cigarette
the general stiffly bows so sorry
the professor nodding smiling and dry washing his hands continues to look at mrs
munson though his story apparently has ended
she returns his ingratiating look with a stare
what about all that money
dorrs smile fades
the money is
he only just re mortgaged his house in order to pay for the procedure that will correct the wandering eye of his common law wife mountain water who suffers from
astygmia and strabismus and a general curdling of the vitreous jelly
pancake however is an ardent foe of the federal reserve and is in fact one of those eccentrics about whom one occasionally reads hoarding his entire life savings either under
the proverbial mattress or as in mr
pancakes case in a hefty bag that is his constant companion
under her stare he elaborates steel sack
dont trust the banks
she thinks decides
this dont smell right
im callin sheriff wyner
a chorus of gasps
madam if you please
it was a lie
a fantastic tale
you have us
dead to rights
but please allow me to tell you the truth in private
he escorts her to sit beneath the portrait of othar sits across from her and leans confidentially in
the words do not come easy
what i am about to reveal to you you may find
munson i must tell you that we are not
what we appear
we are not in fact musicians of the late renaissance
nor of the early or mid period
we are in fact
desperate men madam
we have tunneled into the nearby offices of the lady luck gambling emporium and have relieved it of its treasure
lord have mercy
it is true that the lady luck is a den of iniquity a painted harlot luring people into sin and exciting the vice of greed with her false promise of
oh her gains are ill gotten yes but i offer no excuses save one
we men have each pledged half of our share of the booty to a charitable institution the general to a placement service for southeast asian refugees mr
pancake to the blue ridge parkway conservancy and lump to the united jewish appeal
as compensation for use of your house we had planned to donate a full share to bob jones university without burdening you with guilty knowledge by informing you of same
but you have wrested the information from me
now it is all on the table
now you have it the whole story the awful truth
yes yes shamefully i admit it yes
but find the victim mrs
munson i challenge you
even the casino itself that riparian gomorra shall suffer no harm
it has an insurance company a financial behemoth that will cheerfully replenish its depleted vaults
that is its function
and the insurance company itself is made up of tens and tens of thousands of policy holders so that we have done the calculations mrs
so that at the end of the day at the final reckoning each policy holder shall have contributed only one penny one single solitary cent to the satisfaction of this
just one penny
think of it mrs
one cent from thousands upon thousands of people so that bob jones university can continue on its mission
why i have no doubt that were the policy holders aware of the existence of that august institution why each and every one of them would have volunteered some token
amount to the furtherance of its aims
well thats probly true
the professor warming has resumed dry washing his hands yes madam sadly the criminal stain is upon my soul but the benefit shall accrue to any number of worthy causes
as long that is as the secret stays with us
and i surely shall not be the one to divulge it
munson nods musing
its hard to see the harm in it
her gaze drifts around the room a smile beginning to warm her face
the smile freezes though as her look catches on something
her pov othar above the mantle looks down with a disapproving scowl
im sorry professor
dorr is taken aback excuse me maam
dont you be leadin me into temptation
madam i must strenuously protest no its just plain wrong
i know your intentions were good and i wont call the police if you give the money back
but i gotta see that you do it
madam and all a you gotta go to church with me next sunday
the professor is incredulous and
engage in divine worship
i made up my mind
you can double talk all you want but its church or the county jail
but she rises
you think it over
i gotta feed the cat
the men all sit around the card table lit from below by an oil lamp
the general is neatly packing the stacks of banknotes into the sackbutt case
munson has rather complicated the situation i know how to discomplicate it
put a cap in the old ladys head
then everything simple again
the group lapses into silence considering
even gawain needs a moment to digest the horror that he himself has proposed
the professor is solemn not easy to do
practical ones a quiet neighborhood a sleepy town
reasons of moral repugnance a harmless woman a deed conceived and executed in cold blood
no gawain would that it were simple
well fuck man
what we gonna do give the money back and go to church
he turns to the general
you sir are a buddhist
is there not a middle way
the general grunts as he closes the clasps on the sackbutt case full of money must float like a leaf on the river of life
and kill old lady
the men murmur
i suppose you are right
it is the active nature of the crime though that so horrifies the squeezing of the trigger the plunging of the knife
but think a moment look at the other tools we have at hand
he looks around
we have the cellar
we have masonry and trowel
perhaps we could simply
sure easiest thing in the world
i could whip up a little mortar in one of those snow saucers lay the bricks anchor in some chains mountain has a source for the manacles
ahh but gentlemen we delude ourselves
think of the womans piteous moans as we lay tier upon tier of brick
think of her lamentations as we fit the last brick into place appealing to our better selves the higher angels of our nature our recollections of our own sainted mothers
no i fear that we lack the sand to commit such an act
shortest and most painless is best
let us confront reality
the retort muffled by a pillow
into the brain
the affair of an instant
the only question is
who wields the weapon
he looks around the table
i believe it is traditional in such circumstances to draw straws
well sure fair enough
he takes a broom leaning against the wall bends back and snaps a handful of its bristles
im thinking though that since i lost my finger i mean literally lost it because of that goddamn cat maybe i should be excused from this thing
hard for me to squeeze a trigger anyway you one whiney motherfucker
i squeeze your nutsack you keep that up
listen punk gentlemen no special pleading no exceptions
its in the nature of the situation that we would all prefer to be excused
pancake grumbles as he counts out five bristles takes one and snaps it in half displaying the short straw to the group and then hands the four long and one
short to the professor well okay
it was just a trial balloon
with a flap of his cape the professor jumbles the straws and encloses them in one hand
sweaty close ups
each man stares at the straws
some hesitant some resolute they draw first the general long straw
his reaction impassive
next lump long straw
his reaction relieved
you all see it
all your fuss over nothing punk
two straws left
gawain stares at them licks his lips
he reaches for one straw touches it hesitates
he touches the other straw hesitates
he goes back to the first straw closes his hand around it closes his eyes and pulls
he lifts the straw into frame before his squeezed shut eyes raises his eyebrows and slowly opens fluttering eyelids to look short straw
the professor smiling opens his fist to confirm that he holds the last long one
slowly slowly gawain mounts the cellar stairs
behind him gathered in a semi circle and looking up from the foot of the stairs the other men wait
as he plants one plodding foot in front of the other gawain raises the gun slides back its primer to make sure there is a round in the chamber and
then slides it shut as he reaches the door
in the foreground mrs
munson sits knitting humming an old temperance tune
in the background the cellar door swings open
marva munson doesnt notice her knitting needles continue their rhythmic clack
we pull gawain gun at the ready as he takes slow cautious steps across the floor
we intercut his pov of the back of the old ladys head bowed over her knitting
as gawain passes the sofa he picks up a cushion and buries in it his hand holding the gun
he looks back up at the old lady
but now still cautiously approaching he cocks his head his expression bemused
nearing the old lady is now different somehow
the perspective is somewhat lower the humming woman sounds not quite the same the rocking chair and the room itself are subtly different
he is a runty ten year old child walking slowly across the floor he is cradling not a gun in a pillow but a squirming little puppy dog
the dog yips the woman turns to look at us
it is not mrs
munson but another black woman of about the same age
what you got there gawain
why nothin mama
nothin my ass
you got a dog there
a filthy noisy little pest of a puppy dog gonna shit all over the house
he wont shit in the house mama im gonna train him i promise gonna train him real good whap
she cuffs him on the side of his head
im gonna train you real good
i told you dont bring no stray dogs into this house
you wait til your daddy gets home he gonna lay into you proper
the little boy weeping throws his arms around his mother please dont hurt me no more
i love you mama
daddy gonna kick your ass
bringin in a filthy dirty dog
gawains little brothers and sisters drawn by the commotion have gathered excitedly to watch
mamas whuppin gawains ass
eagerly aint you gonna use the strap mama
gawain is sobbing please dont hurt me mama
now it is the adult gawain blubbering
the clack of knitting needles stops and mrs
munson turns to look
what you doin
what you doin with my pillow there
he surreptitiously slides the gun into his pocket sniveling im sorry maam i whap
she cuffs him on the side of the head
im displeased with you
colored boy like you falling in with that trash downstairs
ashamed a yourself
didnt your mama raise you right
gawain is tramping down the stairs
i cant do it
the men are stunned
this is most
she reminds me of my mama
i cant shoot my mama
you motherfuckers just draw straws again
wait a minute
youve got to accept your responsibilities young man
and your irritated bowel
i cant shoot that old lady
now look here its the easiest thing in the world
pretend her head is a casaba melon and the gun is a melon baller and what the fuck you talkin about man
you think this a melon baller you do it man
my my this is most irregular
look with equal rights come equal responsibilities im afraid that mr
pancake is right my dear fellow
we cannot draw straws again the exercise loses all credibility if you show that the loser can simply beg off doing the job
gawain shoves the gun toward pancake
she just an old colored lady to you you do it man
why you sniveling little coward
what you say you whiney motherfucker
i come up your irritated ass with this motherfuckin gun he is waving the gun
you think you scare me you mewling punk
you dont scare me
bull connor and all his dogs didnt scare me
he shoves gawain
be a man
he shoves him back
pancake shoves be a man
you aint no fuckin man fuckin a sixty year old lady in pigtails
they are shoving each other now getting into it
he lunges at him with a bear hug and his inertia sends both men tumbling to the floor where they roll and wrestle
i seen virginia hams id rather stick my dick in than your old bang
a muffled gunshot
the two men have stopped rolling
they stare at each other where they lie pancake on top
at length oh my god
horrified he slowly rises
i think hes hit
the men gather round and look down
gawain still stares up at the ceiling
pancake stoops waves his hand in front of his eyes
ill just check the carotid artery
he checks the carotid artery
thats a negative
is he dead professor
sure hes dead
i checked his carotid artery
well this is most irregular
we will need a hefty bag
the professor lump and the general peek out
the living room is empty but a sliver of the kitchen is visible its light is on and we can hear water running
dorr hisses she is in the kitchen
i shall distract her while you steal out with the carcass
dorr enters breezily mrs
munson is at the sink filling a teapot
dorr positions himself so that to talk to him mrs
munson has her back to the living room
well my dear mrs
munson i have outlined your position to my colleagues and i now return to you to return our collective verdict
behind her the general peers around the corner and starts a catlike advance across the living room
there was much spirited discussion and an atmosphere of frank give and take
some of our number were initially appalled at your proposal that we simply return the money some were more receptive
i dont care they was receptive or not
and that attitude madam was a factor in our discussions
to a man i must say they were devastated at the prospect of not being able to contribute to their respective charities
the general signals to lump who now crosses the living room with a big garbage bag slung over one shoulder in a firemans carry
well that is a shame
but at the end of the day your position prevailed and the men have decided that we shall return the money every last cent of it
and attend sunday services rather than spend the remainder of our years wasting away in the mississippi mens correctional facility
though that was the original preference of some
well im glad yall came to see the light anyway
im gonna have some tea and go to bed
the professor seeing that the general and lump have made it out the door is anxious to wind things up so the money shall be returned tomorrow at the opening
of the casino office
enjoy your tea madam
backing out he looks to one side
through the living room window he can see the hearse pulling away from the curb
there is another car an old volkswagon microbus slowly tooling the opposite way down the street
dorr looks back to mrs
and congratulations on having recalled to the fold five poor confused sheep who had momentarily strayed
we are at the middle of the bridge the tower gargoyle looking blankly down at the doings below
in the misty night lump and the general are braced over the railing looking down each holding one of the feet that protrude from the hefty bag cinched around gawains
a cigarette burns on the generals lower lip
behind the two men we can see the idling hearse
there is the toot of the garbage scow
lump and the general release gawains feet
their pov shows the sack receding and flumping into the garbage piled onto the scow that slips by below
a flock of scavenger birds disturbed by the impact lifts off the scow with angry caws
dorr skulks at a corner of the living rooms picture window peering out at the street
the volkswagon microbus again cruises slowly down the street in the same direction as previously apparently it has been circling
the professor scowls
the hearse pulls up to the curb
the professor clomps down the cellar stairs
pancake is loading their digging implements into a satchel
they back yet
dorr is absent yes
yes they just arrived
pancake straightens from the satchel
ill go dump these in the hearse
he mounts the stairs with a satchel in either hand
we can hear the front door opening as the other men enter
dorr bemused but apparently moved by a hunch advances slowly to the sackbutt case
he slides the catch that lets its spring clasp pop up
he lifts the lid
mother jones magazine
piles of mother jones magazines
what in heavens name
he riffles a pile confirming that it is in fact all magazine no money
lump and the general are clomping down the stairs
we are pulling clark down the street a satchel in either hand
the microbus parked halfway down the block ominously idling
we are close on its side view mirror
someone leans from the drivers seat for a view into the mirror and in the mirror we see her pigtails swinging mountain girl
clark pancake still rather small approaching up the empty street
pulling him again
a smile is beginning to play at the corners of his mouth
no extra share huh
the smile abruptly fades
he stops in his tracks for no discernible reason
at length nnnrnf
behind him in the deep background we see the general bounding into the street and silently toward us
the moment passes
pancake shakes his head as if to clear it and resumes his walk
we are nearing the bus
mountain girl sits in the idling bus waiting
with a thunk and a gentle rock of the bus we hear its back doors opening and pancakes voice
we hear an oof
of exertion as pancake hoists each of the two satchels into the back
the oofs are followed by nnrungh
to show pancake being garotted by the general
the tower gargoyle stares sightlessly down
lump and the general are at their accustomed place each holding a foot shod in a large hiking boot
behind them we see the hearse idling
near them on the bridge both hands grasping the railing as he gazes dreamily out into the night is the professor
like those nicean barks of yore that gently oer a perfumed sea
we hear the toot of the boats horn and the men drop the body
they quickly stoop and grab another bag swaddled body out of which even larger hiking boots protrude
the weary wayworn wanderer bore
they drop the second body
to his own native shore
we hear the distant flump and the cawing of scavenger birds
with three protruding straws
lump picks a long straw relief
the general picks a short straw
a short grunt
i believe at last we have the right man for the job
munson lies on her back gently snoring
at the open window sheers ripple in the evening breeze
a large clock ticks upon the mantle
it is almost one oclock
it creaks open
the general looks stealthily out
a cigarette in his mouth plumes smoke
he pushes the door fully open emerges
munsons snore catches on an inhale
she mutters something sighs and resumes snoring
the general treads lightly noiselessly up the stairway leading to the second floor
he slides one hand into his jacket pulls out a garotte
with the faintest whoosh he whips it in a complicated loop and snags the other handle with his other hand
the general emerges from the staircase and advances on the closed bedroom door
as he reaches for the knob he performs the no handed flip of the burning cigarette into his mouth
the door swings noiselessly open
the general pauses to survey the still room
the ticking clock
munson a large sleeping mound upon the bed
the general advances raising the garotte in both hands
he closes on her sleeping form
the garotte is lowered toward her exposed neck
it is a foot half a foot inches away
somewhere a muted gear ratchets and triggers the toll of the clock striking one
it is a cuckoo clock but instead of a bird emerging a berobed jesus comes out with his hand resting on the head of a child who gazes up in
the general starts at the noise and then suddenly freezes his eyes widening
jesus retreats back into the clock
the general has swallowed his cigarette
he reaches up to his throat panicked
in a silent frenzy he yanks loose his ascot
he gazes wildly about
he reaches for the water glass at mrs
he tips it back into his mouth
there is a rattling sound
the uptilted water glass is sending false teeth full uppers and lowers rattling toward his face
he frantically but still noiselessly sets the glass back down
wildly looks about one hand clamped to his throat
a mad but silent dash for the door
plunging for the head of the stairs a brief yowl from the cat recoiling from where its tail has been stepped on a hiss and a flash of its claws
at the generals leg and he falls down the stairs each thudding impact bouncing his body like a rag dolls
at the bottom of the stairs he lies still
a close up shows his head bent at an unnatural angle unblinking eyes staring
traces of smoke wisp from each nostril and his open mouth
over the mantle othar returns the dead mans stare
he looks somewhat smug
the professor and lump responding to the noise look slowly up toward the ceiling
the body is laid out in a garbage bag by the rail
the professor stands looking at it contemplatively
lump stands looking at it contemplatively
the cat sits nearby on its haunches looking at it impassively
the professor muses twas our ate brought us to this pass
there is the toot
of an approaching scow
dorrs manner is still absent his regard still on the corpse our overweening pride
the old woman is a more potent antagonist than one had imagined
he rouses himself goes over to the bagged corpse
lump follows him and the two men hoist the body over the rail
now lump im afraid it falls to you to finish the job
they let the body fall onto the scow passing below
the comedy must end
the professor turns to lump and tries to hand him gawains gun but lump uncomfortable declines to take it
professor i been doing some thinking
oh dear oh dear oh dear
maybe shes right
maybe we should be going to church
oh dear lump
i feared that those would be your words
not that i dont appreciate your giving the matter the benefit of your thought
but please recall young man our respective functions in this enterprise
i am a professor the professor as you yourself so often say the thinker the brains of the operation trained in fact in the arts of cogitation
you lump are the goon the hooligan the dumb brute whose actions must be directed by a higher intelligence
yeah i know but no buts dear boy
do not repeat the error of thinking
now is the moment of praxis
now my dear boy you must act
lump reluctantly takes the gun that the professor thrusts upon him
i cant do it professor
a nice old lady like that
think of the riches lump that you and i alone shall divide
recall the dream of wealth untold that first drew you to this enterprise
but and reflect also that if you decline to act forcing me to do so then you shall no longer have any entitlement to the money
your offices shall have been nugatory
you mean you mean youre gonna kill her
my hand would be forced
i cant let you do that professor
a nice old lady like that
you stupid boy
you very very extremely stupid boy
we hear the toot of an approaching scow this one very long sustained under all of the following oh yeah
he points the gun at the professor and well who looks stupid now
squeezes click on an empty chamber
he turns the gun to have a look
shows the foreshortened barrel as he experimentally squeezes the trigger
the professor on the bang
and after a sad shake of his head lump in time to see him finish toppling back over the rail
the scow horn ends
it had to be thus
he goes to the railing to look down
lump face up on a pile of garbage glides away
disturbed birds flap upward
the professor muses
lo in yon brilliant window niche how statue like i see thee stand
his gaze rises with the ascending birds
among the white gulls is one black bird
the professor eyes it as it rises past him
we look down on the professor the black bird rising to perch on the gargoyle on the suspension tower in the foreground
the bird settles on a loose teetering piece of masonry
looking at the receding red light on the bridge of the receding scow
the agate lamp within thy hand
the teetering chunk of masonry tips away and the perchless bird flaps off
very dreamy he sees something in the distance beyond time and space ah psyche
from the regions which are holy land
this is punctuated by the crunching impact of masonry scoring a direct hit on his head
he falls over the rail
his cape snags on the railing and he hangs limp and lifeless
directly below his dangling body the stern of lumps barge is slipping away to leave black waters and the clanking of chains
the fabric of the professors cape begins to tear
his body drops in fits and starts as the fabric gives way
finally the body rips free
it falls away from us
as it does so the clanking chains are pulling into view the second banger a garbage barge being chain towed by the receding scow
dorrs body lands neatly on the barge
a gust of wind
the cape flaps free of the railing and is wind tossed away amidst the cawing birds
the cat watching blinks
it is resting on the very edge of the night table protruding in fact past the tables edge
it is morning
we hear rustling from the bed
hands reach into frame and hesitate finding the glass empty of water and precariously perched
the hands tip the glass and take the teeth
we hear complicated oral noises
the door opens away to reveal the morning paper lying on the stoop
munson leans into frame to pick it up and we adjust as she straightens to have a look the headline says
million disappears from lady luck casino
the subhead police baffled
munson is walking down the stairs
she stops midway down and looks the empty cellar
money stacked neatly on the card table
munson sadly shakes her head
couldnt face the music
munson is climbing the porch in her sunday best
she feints at the dog who lies curled in the sun scoot now
outa the way
the sheriff is busy on the phone there is a deputy today also on the phone
the sheriff seeing mrs
munson enter covers the phone with one hand
sheriff i gotta make a statement

the sheriff exchanges a significant look with the deputy then murmurs into the phone call you right back
he cradles the phone and smiles at mrs

the deputy pauses to look up from his phone howd it get there marva

the sheriff looks back at mrs

she picks up her handbag and heads for the door
well long as everybody knows

youre welcome sheriff
just doin my duty
munson is walking home
it is a beautiful spring day
from far off wafting toward us on the breeze we can hear the church chorus singing
munson joins in
she has a strong voice leaning leaning safe and secure from all harm
lean on jesus lean on jesus leaning on the everlasting arm
she turns up the walk to her house
what a fellowship what a peace of mind safe and secure from all harm
lean on jesus lean on jesus leaning on the everlasting arm
when she opens the front door the cat slips out
it races off down the street
pickles scurries along the walkway
we hear the toot
of an approaching scow
the cat reaches the middle of the bridge
he sticks his head through the bars of the railing
when we cut close on the cat as he looks down at the water we see that he holds in his mouth a human finger
as the scow passes underneath the cat opens its mouth and lets the finger drop
the finger falls away and is barely visible by the time it hits the scow
the cat looks up into the lens and blinks
its sideways irises adjust
the scow is gliding away
with the low mournful toot of its horn we tilt up the river to the great garbage island where scavenger birds pick through the trash
