lock stock two smoking barrels by guy ritchie this whole scene is shot using only extreme close ups of eyes cards tapping fingers and mouths
we open on a bright pair of eyes
one is bruised and slightly swollen but this does not detract from their clarity
three card brag is a simple form of poker you are dealt only three cards and these you cant change
if you dont look at your cards youre a blind man and you only put in half the stake
three of any kind is the highest you can get the odds are four hundred and twenty five to one
then its a running flush you know all the same suit running in order then a straight then a flush then a pair and finally whatever the highest card you
there are some tell tale signs that are valuable i am not going to tell you them because it took me long enough to learn them but these can only
help a player not make one
so you want to play
what have you got
we cut to a beady pair of eyes and then to his cards as they are turned over three hearts of no consecutive numbers are exposed
thats a good hand
a flush beats my pair
what about you
cut from completed film
another pair of excited eyes widen to the question
we see more cards a run is revealed
and heres me trying to explain the game to you
hustlers youre all hustlers
we cut to a shot of a small amount of money being scooped up
you got some real money
ed scoops up a large pile of money
odds chaps you gotta remember the odds
a loud slam of a door
we cut to a wide shot of a policeman who has just entered
it is then revealed that two of the three players are also policemen
they stand to attention red faced with embarrassment
i hope i am not interrupting
i havent slept for forty eight hours got a dozen broken ribs can feel a case of the flu coming on and
interrupts all right all right dont think i wouldnt like to get rid of you but before i do i need to know whats going on son
if you think youre in the dark i am in a black hole blindfolded
we pull back out of the black to reveal that we have been sitting in the inside of a shotgun
the barrels recede further then boom
lock stock are shot out of the top of the screen in peppered letters
we wait for a while as the barrels reappear through
we then see one smoking barrel boom
the other is let off and two smoking barrels joins the sentence
we open on a smart casually dressed man selling perfume and jewellery on a street corner
a crowd has gathered attracted by the alarming volume at which he is advertising his wares
see these goods they never seen daylight moonlight israelite fanny by the gas light
if you cant see value here today youre not up here shopping youre up here shoplifting
take a bag take a bag
i took a bag i took a bag home last night and she cost a lot more than ten pounds i can tell ya
tell me if i am going too cheap
not ninety not eighty not forty half that and half that again thats right ten pounds
dont think cos its sealed up its an empty box
the only man who sells empty boxes is the undertaker and by the look of some of you here today i would make more money with me measuring tape
a well dressed zealous character eddy appears from behind the crowd waving money
it seems he cant wait to get rid of it
bargain thats a bloody bargain if i ever heard one
ten pounds you say
ill have five
ill just wrap
changing his attention
excuse me misses sorry sir ladies first and all that
a tourist spectator rather than a buyer has been
put on the spot
she fumbles through her bag hastily all too aware of the attention of the crowd of which she is now the focus
she passes her money like its contaminated
others follow suit
buy em you better buy em theyre not stolen they just never been paid for
this really stokes the fire
the money cant come fast enough
just as business reaches its peak there is a call of alarm from the first enthusiastic punter who seems to be rather more familiar than he first pretended
bacons expression changes dramatically
a series of crash zooms between eds bacons and a third partys eyes the police reveal there is a problem
theyre off eddy and bacon run like they have done this before
they go down an ally ed jumps some stairs we freeze
voice over ed can run fast talk fast eat fast and play cards fast but hes fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz
voice over the reason he is called bacon is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them
but he is a big boy now and it is time to move on
we cut to a shot of ed as he lands
he has made good distance
eddy arrives at a grocers shop
we meet tom
tom is talking to nick the greek
what are you talking about
i am bloody skinny pal
of course you are
all right ed
nick the greek always a pleasure
all right tom what you been eating
tom examines his midriff and adopts a confused expression
please both join me in my orifice
they work their way past a maze of boxes
fingering and admiring one of the boxes how much did you say it was tom
you know how much it is nick
and that does include the amp
you know it doesnt include the amp
tom and ed make their way through a busy well equipped kitchen
this is obviously a smart and serious establishment
they stop in front of the man whose uniform is covered in blood he appears to be the head chef
what have you come as
thats the last time i am getting any more fruit off you tom
call that fresh
there was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit
you should open a butchers not a grocers
if you will order stuff that comes from kat man fucking du dont be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route
never mind that what about the money
get your fingers out of my soup
soap pulls out a bag from under where he is sitting
voice over soap is called soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour
he is proud of his job and even more proud that its legal
voice over hes a stroppy sod but hes got more balls than a golfer only he doesnt know it
cut from completed film
ed looks in bag
are you sure you can afford twenty five
well that depends on how you look at it
i can afford it as long as i see it again if thats what you mean
you got the rest from the fat man and bacon
tom looks on with suspicion
whos this fat man then
bacon the fat man and myself and its time to make a call to harry
a hard looking man of about fifty is sat behind a large antique desk
on this desk is a hatchet resting in a block of wood poised like a judges hammer
harry is obviously in the sex game
cluttered up in a hazardous way are a selection of dildos spanking paddles etc
a cabinet of fine looking shotguns is placed behind
we have a split screen involving eddy and his friends listening in and hatchet with one hand on the phone and the other on a shotgun
you got it all
a hundred grand
voice over you see its not easy to take a seat at this table the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of
voice over the man who decides if you can play is this man harry or hatchet harry as some including himself like to call him
well if you got it you got it
now if you dont mind
the phone is slammed down
voice over when the old bastard is not playing cards hes chasing a thousand debts that ill fated individuals owe for an array of reasons
voice over sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in harrys stone cold heart
cut from completed film
whats this eddy like then
the camera spins round to reveal a massive monster of a man sitting opposite hatchet
meet barry the baptist
voice over hatchet has a colleague a monster of a man barry the baptist
voice over the baptist got his name from drowning people for hatchet
voice over but he needs him because he is good at making sure debts get settled and jobs get done
eddy been shaking the knees of a lot of good players
the boy has a rare ability he seems to make cards transparent got bluffing dow
interrupts all right all right so we can say he is good
better than good he is a fucking liability
where did he get a hundred grand
he has got some adhesive mates they have tossed up between them
and jd is his dad and owns the whole property
no mortgage no debts lock stock the sodding lot
dont worry i got it under control
good you can get this under control now
a glossy christies brochure displaying a pair of impressive antique hammer lock shotguns is shoved in barrys face
it seems lord appleton smythe has run out of money and these little beauties are up for auction but i am not paying quarter of a million quid for em
if you know what i mean barry
one of my associates has given me an address and the location of these lovelies
make sure we get everything from inside the gun cabinet
i dont want to know who you use as long as they are not complete muppets and dont tell them what theyre worth
changing the subject
hold on what do you think of these
we are selling hundreds
holds up one of the spanking paddles
er very nice harry
whats it for
dont play innocent with me bazza spanking
the paddle is brought down hard on the desk slap
meet the dog
dog is horrible
he is large and intimidating
administering pain is dogs forte
he is also the guy we cut from the last scene slap to the teeing of a golf ball
dog pulls a sadistic and alarmingly pleasurable face
its a dog eat dog world lads and i got bigger teeth than you
we see an individual hanging upside down tied up with gaffer tape but otherwise naked
an orange is stuck in the mans mouth
dog is standing on another mans chest who has a tee stuck between his teeth from where dog fires golf balls at the other unfortunate figure
the tied up man is gordon
the other is slick
gordon nods his head erratically implying that he has reached a decision
to plank i think your man is trying to say something
perhaps not maybe i should have another swing just to make sure
agonised muffled screaming from gordon
slick who has a tee in his mouth shuts his eyes in horror as the golf ball thumps into gordon
yes gordon is there something you would like to tell us
the orange is removed from gordons mouth
rushing to get the words out in the kitchen under the floor
interrupts shut it you idiot
dog swings the golf club round slicks jaw knocking him unconscious
you were saying
its in the karzi pull the fishing wire under the seat
jesus for gods sake let me down
i think you want to have a look at this
plank returns holding an assortment of drugs and cash
gordon starts to scream
dog picks up a steel for sharpening knives and throws it across the room
ed bacon soap and tom park outside their house
as they get out they pass plank and john who have also just parked
they ignore each other and go to their separate doors
bacon places a pile of money on a table
the rest are eating tom keeps looking at his plate distastefully
twenty five from me tom soap and yourself a hundred grand to the pound
you dont need to count it
i still will if you dont mind
eating so a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty for twenty five grand invested
thats going on previous experiences
thats going on optimism
whatever its going on its still enough to send you on a cooking course
youre not funny tom youre fat and look as though you should be funny but youre not
tom is definitely not overweight quite the opposite in fact
he examines himself to see if something has developed
who are you calling fat
what are all these fat jokes about
the light switch above toms head lets out a few sparks causing him to cower in a sharp defensive action
its good in here aint it
trains overhead walls exploding
why the hell did you move in
because its cheap like a budgie
and nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to a bit anti social you know
bacon beckons tom to a cupboard built into the wall
what do you mean
he means theyre thieving dogs
i mean when they are not picking peanuts out of poop theyre ripping off unfortunate souls of their hard earned drugs
bacon opens the cupboard doors and puts his finger to his lips
the noise from next door immediately gets louder
not exactly thick these walls
off no you prat thats for me
dog has a small pile of money and pills that he is distributing to his lads
how many times do i have to explain this to you plank
you find a job worth doing and you will find your share improving
now do you have a problem with that
he obviously doesnt
tom raises his eyebrows and frowns to bacon
big boys gym solarium night meet big chris and little chris twelve years old
how long has he been in there son
about twenty minutes
is he on his own
just carrying a bag
lets have a look shall we
son have a look under that one
little chris looks under one of the sunbeds
its not him dad
try that one
little chris returns from a peek and nods in confirmation
sleeping like a baby
big chris then approaches and raises the sunbed
this is one of those high powered numbers isnt it
john odriscolls eyes widen chris slams down the sunbed on top of him as hard as he can
got some bad news for you john
what the fu
big chris slams down the sunbed on top of john
mind your language in front of my boy
big chris repeats the earlier treatment twice more
that includes blasphemy as well
now tell me john
tell you what chris
a man opens the sunbed mom door
i say hold on
i say shut it
he said shut it
chris pulls a mean face the door is closed
tell me john how you can concentrate on improving a lovely tan and it is a lovely tan by the way when you have more pressing priorities at hand
bang as sunbed comes down again
did i say speak
and its mr harry to you
now dont disappoint me and chose your words carefully
you may speak
ill have it for mr harry in a few days
i have been busy and i am nearly there
son have a look in his locker
no chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there
cut from completed film
yeah all right
big chris lifts it then smashes it down again
now you want me to lift it up again
little chris pipes up
obviously familiar with counting money he has flown through it
hes not poor
five hundred and sixty pounds and thats just in his wallet
fuckin ell john you always walk around with that in your pocket
the expression on big chriss face changes
next time you use language like that boy youll wish you hadnt
right well put the rest of the stuff in that son
you can go home in a plastic bag tonight john
you owe what you owe arid before this tan has faded you want to have paid
chris punches john unconscious and turns the time dial up
jds bar is an impressive sort of uptown downtown establishment with pretty girls serving a laddish clientele
the boys are propped up at the bar looking straight ahead in silence
they look nervous
the silence is broken by ed
i am going to the john
he walks off
what you telling us for
the only thing i care about is whether you get your rest in
tom youre all heart
listen cooky you want to make sure that man rests before he plays its in all our interests
the bar owner and eds father all right lads
hows it going soap
cooking all right
wheres that son of mine
each time a question is asked the lads try to answer but are just left with their mouths open which remain open as a gorgeous girl walks through the bar
we cut to a small humid artificially lit illegal forest being cultivated for profit
someone is smoking a joint and raising his eyebrows at his friend
these two characters are j and charles they have got hair down to their shoulders small try hard goatees and science lab coats with nothing much underneath
coughing this gear is getting heavier you know charles
i got a suspicion we should have been rocket scientists or noble peace prize winners or something
a horn blows the door bell
who the hell is that
the door opens to reveal willy
under each arm is a large bag of fertilizer
give me a hand charlie i could break sweat at any second
a voice comes from behind them
at the top of the stairs stands winston
he slowly starts to walk down
charles why have we got this cage
er for security
thats right for security
so tell me charles whats the point in having it if we dont fucking use it
well because its willy and willy lives here
yes charlie but you didnt know it was willy did you
chill winston its me and charlie can see its me so whats the problem
the problem is willy that charlie and yourself are not the quickest of cats in the alley at the best of times so just do as i say and keep
the fucking cage locked
pause as the two in the door look slightly pissed off at being shouted at
winston sighs and looks at what willy is carrying
what are you carrying willy
you went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer
alarm bells are ringing willy
we need fertilizer winston
we also need a fucking money counter william
we have to get the money out by thursday and ill be buggered if i am counting it
and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer couldnt you be a little more subtle
what do you mean
i mean we grow copious amounts of ganja and you dont look like your average hort er fucking culturalist thats what i mean willy
winston turns on his heels and walks off
ed returns to the bar to find tom soap and bacon looking in disbelief
pointing to watch what the hell are you doing here
why whats up
er let me guess my foot in your arse
a game of cards and hatchet harry
youre supposed to be getting some rest boy
ed grimaces as his father approaches
he has overheard this last statement
jd you playing cards tonight with harry
pauses dont be silly dad i wouldnt have anything to do with that
we calm down for a while
a cool track is playing
ed is now smartly dressed sitting in an armchair
we have a close up of his face
he is motionless eyes closed he looks asleep
the camera slowly tracks down his body we reach a single hand he is cutting the pack skilfully and faultlessly he is very much awake
there is a knock on his door
his eyes open
near naked girls are gyrating against blue poles which keep distracting these mens attention
meet the two scousers gary and dean
the scousers are in their late twenties one big one small
gary the smaller sports a large demi perm
they bear strong liverpudlian accents
they are meeting barry hatchets man

youre doing it for me is all you need to know
you only know that because you need to know
i see one of those on a need to know basis things like a james bond film is it
careful remember whos giving you this job
a bit of confused eye rolling goes on
barry eventually looks at his watch
i am off its all yours now
call me when youre done
as he leaves the two scousers eye him distastefully
to dean i hate these southern shites
on his way out whispering to himself fucking northern monkeys
eddy and the lads have all made an obvious effort with their appearance
they are met by a doorman
yeah invitations you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it
well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the queen on it
will that do
all right just you the others can wait in samoan jos next door
yon mean the pub
hold on bollocks no one but card players in here tonight sonny and i do mean no one
eddy enters the boxing gym on his own and raises his eyebrows at the thought of climbing into the ring
everybody else is sitting down counting their money and converting it to chips
ed takes the only empty chair and has a quick look around particularly behind
evening frazer phil don
this is a bit dramatic isnt it
is it supposed to be symbolic
all right ed
apparently its for security
i would have brought my gloves if i had known
you must be eddy
yup you must be harry
sorry i didnt know your father
never mind son you just might meet him if you carry on like that
there is an attractive blonde croupier shuffling the cards
eddy evening tanya it has been a while
as the boys walk in to samoan jos a man comes tearing out of the door covered in flames followed by his friends trying to put the flames out
the lads look on in mild shock
i heard this place was rough
the scousers make their way to the front door and unravel their lock picking kit
samoan jos night what sort of a pub is this then
a samoan one
receiving a monstrous leafy cocktail whats that
a cocktail you asked for a cocktail
no i asked you to give me a refreshing drink
i wasnt expecting a fucking rainforest you could fall in love with an orang utan in that
you want a pint go to the pub
i thought this was a pub
its a samoan pub
well whatever it is could you get your man to turn the tv down
you ask him if you like but i would leave him to it if i was you
bacon looks at rory breaker the man watching the tv
excuse me could you turn the tv down
he takes a swig of whatever he is drinking and frowns at bacon
bacon frowns back then soap interrupts
this is the english brazil game isnt it
this is three card brag gentlemen
that means that three threes is the highest then three aces and then running down accordingly then its a running flush a run a flush then a pair an open
man cant see a blind man and it will cost you twice the anti to see your opponent
dont fuck around fellas you all know the rules and you know i wont stand for it
what sort of shirt is that then ed
three hundred open
the type of shirt that has buttons on the front and collars at the top frazer
one hundred and fifty blind
three hundred and fifty open
cut from completed film
three hundred and fifty open
youre the only fella in london who wears shirts like that
three hundred and fifty open
no frazer its just im the only classy fella you have had the pleasure of seeing in london
one hundred and seventy five blind
four hundred open
four hundred open
like that do ya son
when my knees stop knocking ill live with it
four hundred blind
barry who is sitting among sweaty towels takes out a four inch monitor and switches it on and hey presto we can see the card table
the camera is placed behind ed in one of the four posts
barry zooms in pauses on the back of eds head gets his focus and jibs down to view his cards pauses and re focuses because ed is playing blind
he hasnt raised them there is nothing barry can do
we cut to barrys other hand
he is pressing a button on a remote control
we cut straight to harrys leg which is receiving the pulse
listen ladies this is cards
men play cards you want to talk soft you should be at the fucking hairdressers so shut up and play
dramatic pause i fold
two thousand open
one thousand blind
two thousand open
deep end eh
two thousand blind
there is a pause as don examines eds brow looking for a trace of nerves
youre still blind
you have been eating too much english beef mate honkers mad
well you going to play
cut from completed film
fucking right i am going to play
three thousand there
four thousand to an open man you know that
we can feel the confidence emanating from eddy
don continues to search eds forehead waiting for a break of nervous moisture but its as dry as a desert disco
donald do you know how to play this game
the reason i put in half the anti is because i dont know what i have got
now play or fold
don is thrown out on to the street screaming and cursing
the scousers having now entered make their way through the large house
ok gary we call each other kenny all right
all right kenny
dean looks at garys disguise with some distaste
he has a stocking pulled over only half his face
a sexy thigh grip is replicating an artificial frilly moustache not giving the desired menacing look
a big bouffant head of hair is neatly being conntrolled up on top
cant you pull that stocking down further kenny
it just cost me fifty quid to have this done
lovingly rearranging his hair if you think i am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards youre mistaken kenny
we cut to a montage of ed hatchet and barry at work
ed must be about up but the game is getting out hand and pieces of paper are being signed ious
dean returns down a corridor carrying an armful of rifles and enters a large bedroom
there are a couple of toffs english aristocrats tied up in bed
the old man has bits of tissue between is toes which gary has seen fit to light in order to extract information
briefly meet lord and lady appleton smythe winston and daisys parents
what are you doing kenny
gary is on the point of lighting another piece of tissue
finding out where he keeps the money
kenny you twat does it look like these people have got any money
they cant even afford new furniture
weve got the guns now if you dont mind
at that moment they are interrupted by the sound of a shotgun cartridge
the ancient butler has made an unexpected entrance
he is holding an equally ancient pair of hammer lock guns the ones from the catalogue which he has obviously got little control of
the recoil knocks the butler clear off his feet
the second shot hits the ceiling covering the old boy in plaster
we cut to a pov of the butler on his back
we see dean looking down
you want to be more careful old fella
you very nearly took my mans head clean off with that
you all right kenny
we cut to a shaking shell shocked gary mouth agape
the gun shot has torn through the centre of garys bouffant hairdo leaving him with a pair of smoking mickey mouse ears
shock prevents him from answering
ten grand blind
we see hatchet feeling his leg he looks shifty barry zooms in again he can see nothing
twenty thousand open
eddy looks at his cards he has a running flush
twenty thousand open
barrv sighs with relief and types in the relevant information
having received this information hatchet pauses then
we hear lots of oohs and aahs
eddy frowns slightly this is odd play
rather than looking happy he has a discrete glance over his shoulder satisfied that nothing can be amiss he collects his money
dont go spending that all at once boy
barrys phone rings
he jumps in shock and fishes around to find it
the scousers reply gary is still unable to speak due to his shotgun experience
i thought you said no staff bazza
you get the guns
you should see what they did to poor gary
gary wanders past the phone box in a gormless state
he obviously doesnt know what day of the week it is
gary get back into the van
barry frowns down the telephone
yeah yeah we got em
ill speak to you later
barry clicks the phone off
dean looks at gary and raises his voice as if speaking to a deaf person
gary gary if you can hear me i think we better get you back in the van now ok
dean takes his arm and guides him back into the van
stakes have increased dramatically
there is a pause as frazer looks at his cards
twenty thousand open
my doctor would beat me to a heart attack if he knew what was going on here
got some cards there boy
back to you already eddy
hatchet looks impatiently at the door
hatchet scours eds forehead
it is still dry
barry who is trying as hard as he can to see eds cards frustratedly zooms in and out eventually ed raises them just enough barry jibs hey bingo he sees
eds got nothing but a pair of sixes
barry excitedly starts tapping away
one hundred grand
hold on fellas i know
hatcher interrupts j i know youre not in which means nobody cares what you know
two hundred and fifty
hatchet and eddy minutely study each others hairlines waiting for a nervous droplet to appear
sweat breaks a drop on eds forehead fills frame
slowly we follow a droplets journey coursing down eddys brow eventually this is met by a large unblinking eye at this point the pause is broken
that is quite a raise one hundred and fifty on my hundred
and is there something else you want to say
eddy as you know this puts us in an awkward position
i dont have enough to continue
we will have to see both your cards if no one loans eddy the money to continue
its a loan or we see both your cards
a lot of nose scratching and examining of imaginary dirty ftngernails spreads contagiously throughout the remaining company
it doesnt look
interrupts i will
you will what
i will loan you the money
the sweat bead reaches the bottom of eds chin trembles for a second then unattaches itself
very slowly it falls
we follow its long silent journey
eventually it is greeted by the back of eds cards
it explodes dramatically in sound and vision symbolizing this worrying news
i think i would rather just turn them over
i am not interested in what you would rather i want to keep going
i am also offering you the money so we dont have to turn them over because you can borrow
i need two hundred and fifty grand
no you need five hundred grand to see me
eds face is now awash busily blistering with sweat
thats if i want to see you
well youre going to have a problem carrying on aintcha
the pause is painful
you can still fold
eddy doesnt like the sound of this
there is sympathy in her voice
harry looks sharply through narrowed eyes at the croupier the croupier pleads with eddy
ill see ya
for half a million
unless you are going to accept twenty quid
and still got a sense of humour
thats not monkey nuts son you can still fold
pause ok before i loan you this i expect if you lose of course my money back within a week crystal
thats sunday ok
these last few words echo in the distance of eds mind and ours
he is committed but has now left the world of the conscious
hatchet turns over the first card its a seven
eddy ushers him on another seven it looks as though he will have three then the third its a four
there is an anti climatic silence
after a loud pause
is that it
cut from completed film
he was bluffing
hatchet looks content and rather nonchalant
lets see your fucking cards
nobody is impressed by hatchets cards all eyes fall on eddy expectantly we crash in to eds pupils with a loud swoosh
they contract to the size of pinheads
his world has changed for ever
voice over i knew he was bluffing but somehow the worst card player round the table had fucked me like a frozen virgin with a pair of sevens
a series of blows to my head with a baseball bat would have been greeted with a grin compared to this
ten minutes earlier i was two hundred thousand pounds richer now i owed half a million
harry approaches ed and whispers in his ear
i know your friends are responsible for most of that cash so ill give you all a week to find it
after that ill take a finger off each of you and your friends hands for each day that passes without payment and when you have all run out of digits
then who knows what
ed gets up
we stumble with him in slow motion
he is hardly able to stand
he wobbles over to the door
harry continues to talk over the top
business is business and i am good at making mine work
i like your dads bar jds so dont get clever or lethargic
if you cant pay in a week a few fingers and a bar for starters
ed stumbles out of the door doubles up and vomits all over the f door
ed has made his way into the bar
all his friends have fallen asleep
one of bacons eyes opens to see ed cleaning himself up
this doesnt look good
the others wake on this statement
we cut between the lads and their frozen reaction
voice over i then explained the unfortunate position we were in
harry was going to start sizing up all our fingers in a week cause he knew there was no way i could raise that kind of money on my own
harry saw it as their money on the table so it was also their debt off the table
i hate to admit it but i could have kissed the old bastard for that
if i said i wanted to settle this debt on my own it would have been a lie
listen i wish he would let me settle it on my own
tom drops his drink and rushes eddy
ill kill him
intercepts tom stop fucking around tom and think
what are we going to do
whats all the fuss about harry
why dont we just boycott the payment
they all look at soap like he is mad
voice over let me tell you about hatchet harry
once there was this geezer called smithy robinson who worked for harry
it was rumoured that he was on the take
harry invited smithy round for an explanation
smithy didnt do a very good job
within a minute harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand which happened to be a fifteen inch black rubber cock
he then proceeded to batter poor smithy to death with this that was seen as a pleasant way to go
hence hatchet harry is a man you pay if you owe
ill think of something dont worry
ed who looks like he is close to suicide has developed a two day stubble and his eyes have disappeared into black sockets
he stumbles along the street with a bottle of scotch poking out of a pocket
he stops outside jds looks at the entrance and decides not to go in
sloanes sitting room day the ridiculous door bell horn blows
who the hells that
its only twelve
use that cage thats what its there for
off who is it
off plank open up
this is done without the use of the steel caged security door
this weed is getting quite a reputation you know fellas
gloria remains motionless in her chair
plank waves his hand about in a sort of how you doing way to everyone and goes to take a seat
at the last minute poised like he is sitting on a potty he realizes he is about to sit on this girl
never saw you there
gloria doesnt respond
plank waves his hand over her face
still no response
plank looks around for some acknowledgement
is she er compus
doesnt look up what do you think
plank takes a close look at the girl
plank jumps back completely taken by surprise knocking over a pedestal of shoe boxes stacked up against a wall full of fifty pound notes
charles pissed off looks at william like its his fault
fod gods sake
clean that up charles
sod you you clean it up
sorry fellas but that stupid cow
never mind could you please just sit down and stay out of the way
anyway how much do you want
trying to look like the money hasnt had an impact on him i am after a half weight
thats one and a half thousand
pass those scales willie and sort out the gear charlie
any chance of seeing your money
cut to bacon soap and tom sitting and talking in the back of jds bar
they dont look a lot better than ed
the odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand
i would rather put my money on a three legged rocking horse
the odds are a hundred to one for a good reason bacon it wont win
so where is ed with all the bright ideas
at the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days its hit him hard
its hit us all hard
yeah but he has got to tell his dad he is about to lose his bar
tom who has not really been listening suddenly interrupts
listen to this one then you open a company called the arse ticklers faggot fan club
you take an advert in the back page of some gay mag advertising the latest in arse intruding dildos sell it a bit with er i dunno does what no
other dildo can do until now latest and greatest in sexual technology
guaranteed results or money back all that bollocks
these dills cost twenty five each a snip for all the pleasure they are going to give the recipients
they send a cheque to the company name nothing offensive er bobbies bits or something for twenty five
you put these in the bank for two weeks and let them clear
now this is the clever bit
then you send back the cheques for twenty five pounds from the real company name arse ticklers faggot fan club saying sorry we couldnt get the supply from america they
have sold out
now you see how many of the people cash those cheques not a single soul because who wants his bank manager to know he tickles arses when he is not
paying in cheques
there is a long pause while bacon considers this
so how long do you have to wait till you see a return
probably no longer than four weeks
so my friend what fucking good is that if we need it in six no five days
well its still a good idea
listen to this one
we see the back of a head
so do you know these geezers well
i have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years
what they like then
nothing heavy four public school guys
soft as shite
soap is finishing off his suggestion for raising money
and you keep all the money pause
bacon and tom frown at soap
i have heard some fucking stupid ideas in my time but yours makes bacons sound inspired
ed fumbles with his keys at his front door
he enters his house in a sort of zombie state takes off his jacket and opens the cupboard doors
he hangs his coat up it promptly falls off the hanger and he collapses in a pile on the floor
the cupboard doors now being open he can clearly hear next doors discussion
we track in very slowly on ed
they ponce around in funny hippie clothes all day talking bollocks
theyre just good at growing weed thats all and business has got bigger than what they can keep up with
if youre so fucking clever why dont you come up with a suggestion
i am thinking i am thinking
off listen they cant be all stupid if they got a container load of cash sitting in shoe boxes a skip load of class a gear and you dont think
there is anybody sensible involved
we reach the end of our track
eds head is on a pitiful angle in full close up
it straightens and his dark eyes widen immediately on this news
what about security
theres one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it
what do you mean never
well what have they got it for then
i must have been there fifty times its never been locked theyre not suspicious
everybody who goes there are toffs
theyre all into that karma crap if i dont harm nobody nobody harms me stuff
is there no way they can get back to you
even if they could theyd be too shit scared
they have got no muscle theyre gutless faggots
barry and harry are talking
harry is polishing a shotgun
it is very different in appearance to the hammer locks
is big chris on his way
should be here any minute
i think youre making a mistake harry
thats a lot of money for chris to be running after
i wouldnt trust him to bring it back here
hatchets speech is laced with cut aways of big chris in action and on the ascent with little chris of hatchets stairs
voice over what do you know about chris eh
you put big chris on a job and he will make sure it gets done no matter whats in his way
his dad used to collect debts and his dad before that and that monster of a boy will after he has gone
it seems that the almighty himself requested them to collect debts for eternity and not to fear knocking on old nicks door himself if he was behind on his payment
but he has never nicked a picker in his life
straight as an arrow and as strong as the bow that fired it
if you dropped your tenner he would search till he found ya
the only problem is he isnt stable has a temper like a runaway train and he hits twice as hard
heaven protect anyone who touches that boy not that the boy needs protecting
we see big chris walking up the stairs
he reaches the top and knocks on the door
big chris is sitting in front of hatchet barry behind chris
want a drink
hello son would you like a lolly
piss off you nonce
oi watch it
no thanks harry we are both all right
one of a pair holland and holland
here you want to hold it
nah not my thing thank you harry
i imagine thats what i am here for
harry leans the gun against the side of the desk and takes a seat does a breast stroke movement to clear his desk of all the sexual debris takes a
big breath of air and begins
i want you to forget about any other debts at the moment there are fresher fish to fry
its a bit of a priority
four young fellas who got in deeper than they could handle they owe me half a million pounds
tom bacon and soap are sitting in front of ed who looks as though he is about to launch in to a speech
whats the flapping about
you told the old man yet
eddy i hope i wont need to
i got a plan
so listen carefully
look he set us up
that means he put money into us which means he expects money out of us
you dont need to be an economist to work that out
he might think we smoke a lot and burn a bit of profit but he cant have any idea about the hard currency weve accumulated
we can just slice it off the top
you guys youve got to realise who this chap is
hes a fucking lunatic
if he gets the slightest inkling that we are not throwing straight dice you and fuck it me are going to know what the sharp side of a kebab knife
charles come on we are in this for the cash however it comes
the phone rings
winston picks it up
cut from completed film
she is upset winston
i know who it is
whats the problem
the situation has been explained
there are thoughtful frowns on all foreheads
there is a pause
well what do you want us to do about it
hit the fuckers
pause while this is digested
i know it sounds a bit heavy but its not like you are doing anything illegal
i dont know how youve reached that conclusion
they cant report they have had all their drugs and money nicked can they
how heavy are the fellas anyway
they dont look all that
hitler didnt look all that
all right but for christs sake were in the soup and this is the silver spoon
if you can think of another way to get out let me know
its not like weve got all the time in the world either
silence falls over them
i am game
well we hit them as soon as they come back
well be waiting and prepared for them
pause as eds voice drops a little
and they are armed
what was that armed
what do you mean armed
armed with what
er bad breath colourful language and a feather duster
what do you think they will be armed with
guns you tit
you never said anything about guns
a minute ago this was the safest job in the world now its turning in to a bad day in bosnia
jesus soap stop being such a mincer
i thought about that and
and what exactly
and we will just have to find out whos going to be carrying them
they could all be carrying them for what we know
no just one of them is in charge of them going to the job
so i assume he will still be carrying when he comes back from the job
oh you assume do ya
what do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuck ups
its the mother of fuck ups stupid
well excuse me brother mother or any other sucker doesnt make any difference they are still fucking guns and they still fire fucking bullets
soap if you got a better idea to get five hundred grand in the next few days you let us know
in the meantime tom speak to nick the bubble about moving the weed
tom and nick are stuck away in a corner playing on a fruit machine
not normal weed
this is some fucked up skunk class a
i cant think let alone move shit
doesnt sound very good to me
neither me but it depends on what flicks your switch and the lights on and burning bright for the masses
youll need samples tom
no can do
a place near katmandu
meet me half way mate
listen its all completely chicken soup
kosher as christmas rolls his eyes jews dont celebrate christmas tom
never mind that now
i also need some artillery you know a couple of sawn off shotguns
bloody hell tom
this is a bit heavy
this is london not the lebanon who do you think i am
i think youre nick the greek
theres a cacophony of seventies funk and football filling the room
we meet rory breaker
rory is a very well dressed cool looking black dude
he is in his own way sophisticated considering what he does for a living
his help however are less well informed
rory has nick the greek in front of him
nick i dont have anything to do with weed normally but if it is what he says it is ill give him three and a half thousand a key thats
if it is what he says it is
i dont want to see it after a sample i dont want to touch it after a sample
ill leave you in the capable hands of nathan here
he will work out the details but let me get this straight
if the milk turns out to be sour i aint the kind of pussy who will drink it
know what i mean
the scousers are handing over all the shotguns from their previous job to barry and assistant
dean has got a complicated hair arrangement to disguise his accident with the butler
barry raises his eyebrows at this new look
is your hair supposed to look like that then
gary ignores this question
next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money or we are going back to post offices and cars
wherere the others
barry is looking with same concern for the hammer lock purdeys
there are no others
now stop fucking around
the others the old ones
i dont know what you mean
dead serious there were two old guns there where are they
not in the cabinet there wasnt
there was a couple of old hammer lock muskets the butler was carrying they were ours and we sold em
well you just better un sell em sharpish
interrupts i am not fucking interested
if you dont want to end up counting the fingers that you havent got or sharing a bed with the anti christ i suggest you get those guns quick
we are facing nicks large behind builders cleavage poking out of the top of his trousers
nick is unwrapping two long implements from a sheet the hammer lock purdeys
jesus if i pick them up will they stay in one piece
where did you get them from
i got contacts
listen tom if you pointed them at me id shit myself or do whatever you said to do
either way you still get the desired effect
they look nice i agree
but lacking in criminal credibility arent they
i might get laughed at
how much do you want for these muskets
seven hundred each
whats that a pound for every year they have been around
i know theyre antiques but i aint paying antique prices
and theyre a bit long arent they
sawn offs are out tom people like to have a bit mare range nowadays
i dont want to blow the arse out of this country granted but i dont want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either
i want to look fucking mean
of course you will look mean tom you will look really scary
all right lets forget about them for the time being
what about your weed man
rory breaker is standing by
you stand to make a lot of money tommy boy
we are looking directly at jds shell shocked face
he gently lays down an empty glass on the bar
i understand if this has come as a bit of a shock but ill tell you how this can be resolved by the good father
big chris in completed film
the camera spins round to reveal hatchet and barry the baptist
i like your bar
i want your bar
do you want me to draw a picture
harry that boy doesnt know his arsehole from his ear hole or you from a hoodwink
this bar is mine and he has nothing to do with it
what and i care
remember you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your sons life
and you do have a reputation so ill choose my words carefully
but not to put too fine a point on it fuck yourself harry
barry pulls a kind of mock scared face and clutches his heart
oh careful jd youll give barry a heart attack
we crash zoom again into harrys eyes to see the pupils contract
its time to look mean
ill put that down to shock but only once only once can or will i let you get away with that
your sons still got three days to find half a million but make up your mind which one you prefer your son or your bar
we have a slow motion close up of the drink being slammed down proving a point
bacon has rigged up an amplifier to the hole in the cupboard along with a ridiculous amount of recording equipment
the house lights still flicker on and off
we start the first part of the conversation looking at bacon who has his headphones on
we cut to dog halfway through the second sentence
theres nothing to worry about its going to be easy
there is no such thing as easy in my experience and if you think this is going to be easy youre a dick
it may be easier than most but its not going to be easy
bacon has a kettle next to where he is sitting
it steams away quite happily but a worrying noise starts to come from the plug socket
bacon prepares himself
he disappears into black
they react to the boom
dog looks at the wall with suspicion misses a beat then continues
whats that idiot doing next door
points at paul we use your van
its up some stairs this place so well stick out like balls on a bulldog
plank is going up first
there is a cage but it is never locked is it plank
and it better bloody not be
once he is firmly in place he gets the rest of us in
well get nasty with a couple of them shit em up scare and gag em
i cant see these wankers giving us a problem but they might have a couple of tools hanging around like any cowboy
when the job is done well come straight back here
its dark by then unload and roberts your fathers brother
right tomorrow eight oclock well do it
apparently these stags dont get out of bed till midday lowest ebb and all that and thats how i like it
bacon is now lit by candle
off so no messing around tonight
we leave eight a
its happening tomorrow morning
get back here now
staggering where did you get those from a museum
nick the greek
how much did you part with
seven hundred for the pair
drachmas i hope
i would feel safer with a chicken drumstick
they could do more harm than good
jesus tom do they work
i dunno but they look nice
i rather like em
top of the list of priorities how nice they look
ladies if you dont mind back to a more important issue
weve only got two real guns
apparently thats what they are
we find a good place to hide next door
when it sounds like the right time we jack in the box look nasty and stuff cocoon them in gaffer tape then we nick their van and swap the gear
into a new van and then bring it back here
as long as we are all out of our hiding places quickly its the last thing theyll expect
if tom and anyone else feels like kicking them around a bit i am sure it wont do any harm
a bit of pain never hurt any one thinking about it if you know what i mean
also i think knives are a good idea you know big fuck off shiny knives the ones that look like they could skin a crocodile
knives are good because they dont make any noise and the less noise the more were likely to use them
thatll shit em up and make us look like pros
there is a pause as they look at soap with suspicion
is there something we should know about you soap
i am not sure whats more worrying the job or your past
ed and bacon etc are all mounted up on top of one another looking out a crack in the curtain
they are observing dogs party en route to work
they are dressed as kebab shop assistants
where the fuck are they going
to butcher a sheep
i thought this was a robbery
where did they get those outfits from
havent we got some like that tom
well not exactly like that
dog and troop load up
cut to sloanes
they are up and unusually awake
today is the day to move the money so they are comparatively alert
there is lots of activity
you fucking jelly heads move it
you have been up for two hours you should have got somewhere by now
the gear and the money has got to be out of here before twelve
the horn blasts
j dont you dare open the door until you use that cage
i am serious and find out who it is first
raising his voice for the door hello can i help you
all right its plank
is willie there
no im afraid hes not
hes out at the moment
well perhaps you can help
well perhaps i cant plank if you know what i mean
look could you just open the door so i could talk without shouting
i cant help you plank
i think youll find it is in your interest
look willie its plank outside asking for you he says its in our interest
i dont care if its king fucking kong he is not coming in here not today
hold on we are in business and correct me if i am wrong but that is business
corrected thats a walking accident that we can do without
william jesus hes ok he knows only to buy weights now so we are looking at least a couple of thou just one last time
what do you think winston
willy this is the last time and dont let him know that youre here otherwise he will be here all day and get rid of him quick
we have work to do
frustrated what the fuck is going on
do you want me to have a look dog
no you silly fucker stay still
whispering whats going on
come on i cant wait out here all day
starting to get anxious that the whole deal could be off plank looks down the stairs and waves at dog as some kind of reassurance
off all right just coming
j unlocks the door after getting the cage ready
theres an external door and then a small corridor before the cage
j is inside the cage
two or at a push three people could fit in this space before they would be poking out on the outside world
i thought you were going to leave me out there all day
i didnt know you were a kebab man plank
taking the piss lives and learns doesnt one
then devastation slaps him hard
keep the gates locked now do you
sorry got to do business like this now cant be too careful these days
suddenly turning very nasty whispering
now shut it
you say a fucking word the right knee goes another word then your left
confused and believing its a joke until he sees the gun
what are you doing plank
what do you think i am doing
what are you doing
unlock that gate
i said unlock that fucking gate
j has found it all too much and has passed out with fear collapsing on the floor in an awkward contorted position
plank is desperately trying to find the right key
things are not going as well as planned
dog in the meantime has decided its time to start the show go
fucking run you two
they all go charging into the open door only to slam straight into plank
the keys go flying out of planks hands and through the cage
plank cries with frustration reaching out with his hand to retrieve them
dog finding the gate locked is none too happy they are also still exposed to the eyes of the world due to the lack of space between the outside door
and the inside cage
mesmerized the fucking gates shut you prick
just hold on i got the keys
having clawed them back with the end of his shotgun
seeing an unconscious man at his feet what the fuck did you do to fauntleroy
fumbling and panicking i didnt touch him he just passed out
j whats going on out there
realising get the rifle out charles
were being fucked
get the sodding gate open now plank
plank is busy fumbling about not really getting anywhere because of the pressure being applied
trying to convince himself as much as dog it must be this one
just give me the keys
the gun with which plank has been entrusted is pointing straight at dogs groin
point your gun in there dick not at me
mick has unwrapped his gun from his case
dog turns and looks amazed at the size of the weapon
what the fuck is that
its a bren gun
you could have brought something a bit more fucking practical couldnt ya
we hear the sound of an air gun pellet hitting the bars
trying to salvage some credibility dont you stags move or ill kill the lot of ya
amazed by this stupidity who are you going to kill plank
theres no one there
we hear another pop and plank gets shot in the neck
this understarulably sends him into a real panic thinking this is curtains
gurgle they shot me
panic unashamedly exposing itself
trickles of blood start flowing from in between planks fingers
unimpressed well shoot them
plank shoots at everything and nothing
smoke fills the corridor leaving them in a cloud
a bit of coughing goes on then silence
jesus plank you could have got smokeless cartridges i cant see a bloody thing
another pellet is fired hitting john in the chest
ah jesus shit ive been shot
i dont fucking believe this
could everybody stop getting shot
sit down john you cock patch yourself up its only a fucking air rifle
dog is interrupted by an enormously loud blast of machine gun fire
dog and the boys panic cover their ears and hit the floor
after this outburst dog looks up at mick and sees he is the culprit
mick looks down at dog expecting a congratulatory nod from dog he doesnt get it
what the fuck was that
that was the bren gun
if you use that again youre a dead man do you understand
he speaks softly but he is quite shaken
he then raises his voice he has had enough of all this mincing
he shouts to the sloanes while dragging the semi conscious body of j up to use as a shield
before i go any further i am going to shoot your mates toes off
no sooner said than done his toes go
the smoke problem repeats itself and j faints again but an unfazed dog continues
now if you want us to be gone in two minutes open the fucking gate now
hell probably kill us if we do
well j will certainly get it if we dont hes serious
look what he did to his toes
off right his legs going now
all right all fucking right i am coming
turning and whispering willie he doesnt know you are here just sort something out ok
willie slinks off with a like what
look on his face
and all your friends theres a good lad
there is only three of us here
do you want me to take his leg off
wheres the fourth
i mean it there is only three of us here
gurgle gurgle yeah one of thems out
ok open the gate
no sooner said than done
dog hits one straight on winstons forehead with the butt of his gun and drags him to the stairs
up boy up up
they reach the top of the stairs
tie em up john and plank you come with me
wheres the money
there in those shoe boxes
dog opens them
there is nothing in them
if looks could kill plank would be pushing up daisies
gun to the head of winston where
out the back
and the weed
out the back
your hands now
i cant i am tied up
well well shake your head or something
all right plank get paul out of the van
this is done on a walky talky
the door opens
willie is waiting behind it armed with a machete
he turns to his opponent and eyes shut for dutch courage hacks straight into micks arm
micks machine gun goes off and william loses a finger as he tries to push the barrel to the side
he starts screaming uncontrollably to plank give us your knife
dog is going to put an end to this screaming and is making his way to its source
william is silenced through fear of the approaching dog and slumps on the floor in a silenced wreck holding a bleeding hand
the point of the blade resting on williams throat enough
mick how you doing
how do you think i am doing
he has fucking nearly chopped my arm off
dogs attention is diverted as he sees a table full of cash neatly packed and stacked
paul in doorway visibly shocked gordon bennett
whats been going on in here
shut up you idiot
you got the bags
can you get it in
theres a lot here all right
i dont think we will be able to get this all in the van
bollocks youll get it in even if you have to do two trips
a traffic warden appears as paul goes outside to load up
you got a ticket already and if you dont move it now sir we will move it for you
ill only be a minute
youve already been fifteen
paul realising that persuasion is futile decides other means are necessary to despatch this nuisance
he looks down both sides of the street the coast is clear
go on look
at what exactly
my van is half full
so ive just got to put you in and i am off
having made their way to the rear of the van paul opens the back doors
paul smacks the traffic warden on the side of the head
the momentum carries the warden into the van unconscious
paul has another quick look round and lifts the wardens legs up and pushes him deeper into the vehicle
my neck dog
dog shows no sign of pity thats the last bag
turning to mick
how about you
ill be fine when have dealt with this little shit
mick grabs the machete that was used to disable him and puts down the machine gun
do it quietly
gloria who has been forgotten by the sloanes and unnoticed by dog and troop has sat through the whole episode without apparently realising the gravity of the situation
she is kick started into action by the sure demise of willie
the machine gun has been placed not too far away from her
she picks it up and fires it into the already wounded body of mick who is almost instantaneously transformed into dog meat
gloria who has found a gear that nobody probably not even herself knew existed destroys everything she points at
bodies jump for cover and winston and the rest close their eyes and hope for the best
eventually the gun which seems to have a limitless supply of lead goes quiet
we cut to close ups of everybody opening their eyes cautiously
looks of relief come from everyone not least the sloanes
dog who is closest stands walks straight up to her and punches her on the jaw gloria is knocked out
what was that
where did she come from
thats fucking it
tie her up
we are getting out of here
eh bunk us up over the wall
bacon forces one of the windows open
he looks pleased and beckons the others over
they keep in contact with soap by cellular phones
everything all right out there tom
on phone right as rain
where the hell are we supposed to hide
ed looks into an almost empty room in which they are to find cover
he shrugs and goes to sort himself out a cup of tea
what are you doing ed
do you want one
no i fucking dont
you cant make a cup of tea edward
the whole of the british empire was built on cups of tea
and look what happened to that
if you think i am going to war without one youre mistaken mate
dog turns to admire a full van
you wont get away with it
dog turns around and sees the tragic warden
paul whats that
thats a traffic warden
looking straight at paul whats he doing in the van
dog and the others look at the tragic warden mercilessly he was about to call the cozzers
paul hits him again sending him back into unconsciousness
we will deal with him later
dogs house day tom is on the mobile phone
dog opens his door enters the front room dumps his two bags down and is met by a bleeding plank who is grunted at and john who is rubbing his
dog sighs and turns to get more bags
the action starts
its hard to tell who is who because of the balaclavas
the lads jump out of their positions
down down get fucking down now this is like d
there is no response as the three of them seem not to believe whats going on
bacon hits dog with the butt of his gun establishing whos boss
dog does down with a thud
plank hits the floor immediately
paul enters sees trouble drops his bags and prepares to run
he is met by tom who greets him with a smash round the kneecaps with a lead pipe
this has more than the desired effect and paul has to be dragged in screaming by tom
it all went rather smoothly tie em up tape em up face and mouth
keys i want the keys
ill find you
of course you will sweetheart
this one search this one
ed finds the keys without any trouble
ill meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there
there is silence
for a few seconds all we can hear is the noise of their breathing
well jesus that wasnt so bad was it
when the bottle in my arse has contracted ill let you know
bacon see what we got
lets have a butchers
jesus theres lots of everything
weve got god knows how much of this stinking weed weve got a shit load of cash and weve got a
a traffic warden
look whats this
he holds up the hat
shit ed weve got a traffic warden
i think hes still alive
hes got claret coming out of him somewhere
what did they want with a traffic warden
i dunno but i dont think we need him
dump him at the lights
its about time you give my young friends a visit chris
tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word and i cant have that now can i chris
no harry you cant
dog struggles free and unravels the tape from his head and gets the other three out
i dont know who they think they could be for me not to find em
of course ill find em
i dont give a flying fucking fish who they think they are
ill kill fur and feathers burning wheel south african style kebab em peel em slice em and dice em hang draw and fucking quarter em
two vans are parked back to back
we see ed and the boys putting one last trunk into the back of the new van
thats it all done we are off
you think its a good idea taking it back to yours
there is nowhere else to keep it and its the last place they are going to look
anyway the battles over and the war is won
ed passes a handful of grass to tom
tom take this to nick and lets get rid of it quick
nick has given the weed to rory for inspection
lenny has stepped in
it is skunk
and its as good as it gets
ok ill take it off you half price
i dont think hell like that
you said three five a key thats what he wants and you know thats a good price
it was yesterday i said three and a half grand and today is today if i am not mistaken
turns back to the tv
ill take it tomorrow for half price
if he wants to move it quick hell take it
now ive got another game coming up in a minute so if you would be kind enough
pointing at the door
lenny take this to snow white and the three little chemists they should have a gander at this
i want a proper opinion
lenny and nathan rorys minders pull up outside the sloanes house to have the weed analysed
for the first time it is revealed that rory breaker owns the sloanes
somethings not quite right here
go in slowly nathan
fuck you funny man you go first
winston is tied up and squirming
for christs sake get us out
well not a bad days work
that takes care of harry
pushing a massive pile of notes to one side
whats left over
hold on give us half a chance to count it
what about all the gear
ere have a pull of this
passes ed the joint
i dont want that horrible shit
give it to soap
can we just lock up and get drunk now please
we see winston nathan and the torso of lenny standing in front of rory like naughty schoolchildren
we had the gates up but they stuck a shotgun through
poor bloody j got shot it was a right mess
the gravity and reality dawns on rory
it will cost you more than your lifes worth if you jest with me
some girl took one of em out but hes a bit of a mess
proudly j we shot one of them in the throat
what do you want a fucking medal
ill shoot you in the fucking throat if i dont get the gear back
he pauses rubs his forehead and continues slightly calmer
you shot the one thats in there now
no another one
this is more like it
so wheres he
they took him with them he was still alive
well what did you shoot him with an air gun
there is an embarrassed pause and a look of how did you know
rory doesnt need an answer and slaps his forehead
we grow weed were not mercenaries
you dont say
there is a pause while rory searches for the right words
the silence is deafening
stupidly who could it be
where do we start rory
rory looks up amazed
today my name is mr breaker
you think this is a coincidence
not many benny
this white shite steals my goods and then thinks it is a good idea to sell it back to me
they got less brains than you lenny
get nick cum bubble round here now if he is stupid enough to still be on this planet
dog has all his boys round
i want you to search the house for bugs
i mean i want you to strip it
what is the point in that
even if it was a bug they would have taken it with em
it is too late for you to start thinking john
it is a possibility and that is good enough for me
and after you strip the house i want you to get every thieving slag this side of ceylon and torture them badly
i want to know who is responsible otherwise i will hold you responsible
all kinds of characters have made an appearance
a game of cards is in motion the forfeit now being alcohol
barfly jack the barman is sitting at the table
they are already on the road to being comfortably comatose
yeah i know rory
this next section is subtitled
this is to keep everyone even those familiar with cockney rhyming slang up to speed with the narration of which even tom is unsure
as with the police scene earlier this is a voice over and we cut to the relevant scenes
voice over rorys got few interests in life darky music football bees and honey and kicking the shit out of anyone that interferes with that shortlist
a few nights ago rorys roger iron rusted so he has gone to the battle cruiser to watch the end of a football game
nobody is watching the custard so he has turned the channel over
a fat mans north opens and he wanders up and turns the liza over
now fuck off and watch it somewhere else
rory knows claret is imminent but he doesnt want to miss the end of the game so calm as a coma he stands and picks up a fire extinguisher and
he walks straight past the jam rolls who are ready for action then he plonks it outside the entrance
he then orders an aristotle of the most ping pong oddly in the nuclear sub and switches back to his footer
thats fucking it says the man
rory gobs out a mouthful of booze covering fatty he flicks a flaming match into his birds nest and the man lit up like a leaking gas pipe
rory unfazed turned back to watch his game
the flaming man and his chinos ran outside to extinguish the flames and rory cheered on
his team won too four nil
after a while ed sees daisy making a sneaky sharp exit and tries to pursue her running out on to the street
daisy is nowhere to be seen
nick is blissfully ignorant of the situation
he is sitting in front of rory
your one saving grace might be your stupidity
looking quite petrified er
dont fucking er me greek boy
how is it that your so fucking stupid soon to be dead friends thought they might be able to steal my gear
and then sell it back to me
is this a declaration of war
is this some sort of white cunts joke that black cunts dont get
cos i am not fucking laughing nik ol as
there are four interests i have nick
football music money and the annihilation of anybody who interferes with that shortlist
i know you couldnt have known my position because youre not so fucking stupid that if you did know you would turn up here scratching your arse with that whats
going on here look slapped on your chevy chase
but what you do know is where these people live
we look at the white faced nick
he doesnt open his mouth
the penny has dropped
if you hold anything back ill kill you
if you bend the truth or if i think youre bending the truth ill kill you
if you forget anything ill kill you
in fact youre going to have to work very hard to stay alive nick
i hope you understand everything i have said
because if you dont ill kill you
now mr bubble and squeak
you may now enlighten me
paul john and plank are lined up like naughty schoolchildren in front of dog who is black eyed and pissed off so we have a bit of a problem dont
er well yes we do
in fact it is a little more than a bit of a problem isnt it
you could say that in the scale of these things this is the mount fucking everest of problems couldnt you
and the reason it is such a mon fucking strosity of a problem is because you dont have the first fucking idea who did this to us do you
dog we have been up all night
its no one round here
we have had them all against the wall
if it was a toe rag from the area we would know
dog starts slapping his troops round their heads
you wouldnt know if it was the next door fucking neighbours you prick
you find em you hear
and find em quick
now get out and start looking
dog loses his temper and throws plank across the room
planks head breaks effortlessiy through the wall
a dust covered plank blinks in confusion as he looks on to a heap of recording equipment
recovering from the night before
scarface i have watched scarface
you want to know how to do a drug deal you watch scarface
that inspires confidence that does
this guy rory breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling
its not worth him giving us trouble he knows we would be a pain in the arse and who wants a pain in the arse
i would take a pain in the arse for half a million
you would take a pain
the arse full stop
tom the fatter you get the sadder you get
jesus would you two stop flirting for one minute
after we pay hatchet this deal puts us up near enough two hundred grand each
not bad for a days work i think you will agree
a seventies style split screen
a very shaky nick answers his cartoon telephone
thats no way to answer the phone
is that you dean
what can i do for you
you know those shotguns i sold ya well i need em back
not likely i am afraid i dont think ill be seeing them again
i got the money to pay for em

gary looks at dean
if we cant get em we cant get em
hatchet harrys office day
barry is on his mobile moments later

we made a deal for everything inside the cabinet
inside out fuckin side
i dont give a shit you get those guns because if you dont
yeah bazza what
you heard of harry lonsdale
otherwise known as back you up with a hatchet harry infamous for his removal of digits
dean pauses for a while a look of concern coming over his face
well this is james bond need to know time
when you dance with the devil you wait for the song to stop know what i mean
hatchet has had enough
he grabs the phone from barrys hand waving the infamous fifteen inch big black cock in the other hand
hatchet goes on to put the shits up the scousers
do you know who i am
i am split in two there is me and there is my patience and patience has gone to the hospital you are not far behind know what i mean
i mean find em torture em kill em and bring back what belongs to me because if you dont
hatchet slams the phone down
dean looks at gary in horror
who was that
that was hatchet horrible harry
jesus i have heard about him
were in the spite
they were his fucking guns that we sold we gotta find em
dean dials nick immediately
no fucking about nick where can i find those guns
dog and boys have made a large hole in the connecting cupboard wall which they have crawled through
dog is holding a large bag which he has found
dog i have found the cash
the stupid bastards
shit dog theres a lot
dont you want to do this next door
were not going next door until weve flayed these dead men walking
count it out the back
i dont want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in
interrupts give it us here you dozy sod
you hide and get the guns ready
wait until they are well in then give it to em
rory breaker is amassing his troops and preparing to go round to eds
we are going to do a proper decoration job
i want the grey skies of london illuminated i want that house painted red
winston here is coming along see if he can recognize any of em then we bring whats mine back here
watch out for these fellas theyve got a bit of arsenal and they dont mind using it
now you know what youre doing yes
big chris and little chris are waiting outside
dogs gang are waiting for eds gang inside
rorys gang are going to eds
six heavy looking black guys are loading their weapons
dogs gang are also loading their weapons and concealing themselves among the furniture
dog is counting out the money in the side room and has the two antique hammer lock shotguns resting on the table in front of him which were found with
the rest of the bounty
rorys boys stop the van outside eds and back up to eds front door
the rear van door is opened when it is completely flush and lenny with gun prepares to do his worst
there is a loud bang and the front door disappears
in its place is a large black man pointing an even larger machine gun
nobody seems to be at home it appears to be quite an anti climax
a long pause follows as both gangs dont quite know what to do
rorys guys jump over the machine gun to explore further
under his breath what the fuck is going on here
dogs lot are confused as to why these guys appear to have broken into their own home carrying weapons of mass destruction and looking to use them
we cut to a close up of planks pov under the sofa
he can see numerous pairs of boots and they are multiplying
at last plank cant take any more his fingers shaking too much on the trigger
we see the windows shattering from the outside as bullets hail through
dog who was counting the spoils in the adjoining room is more than aware of the seriousness of the situation
he quickly closes his suitcase of money and grabs the two old guns opens the adjoining door gets splattered in blood and smoke and quickly closes it
he then checks his escape route out of the front window and exits
dog looks quite pleased with himself as he still has the money and his life and is holding the infamous guns in each hand like a mexican bandit
big chris watching the house intrigued and interested by all the activity has made his way closer and low and behold looks what walks straight into him
got something here for me have ya
dog is stunned by this come on chop chop
before dog has a chance to use the shotguns chris grabs one in each hand and knocks dog down with a swift headbutt
dog moans not knowing what day of the week it is
chris opens the case sees its full of money takes the two shotguns then leaves
thank you very much
on reaching the car he gives the case to his son putting the guns on the back seat
count that son and put your seatbelt on
follow that car gary hes got the fucking guns
eds place has been shot to pieces
only rory and winston in shock seem to be left
rory is throwing the bags of weed into the back of his van then he kicks over one of the bodies
its a blood covered plank
this is one of them
winston nods in confirmation
plank to rorys surprise still had a loaded gun
rory and plank despatch each other simultaneously
tom bacon ed and soap look hung over ed is driving
theres six black cocks sitting on the side of the road
how many beaks have they got between them
how many wings have they got between them
how many feet
er well twelve
so how many whiskers has the little white kitten got
how the fuck should i know
how come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white pussy
the end of this joke is interrupted by a van swerving past them dangerously close
the lads lodge a complaint and then they stop outside ed and bacons so that they can pick up the money
cut from completed film
what has been going on here
they look into a smoking blood covered house
the money the gear
thats fucked it
what do we do now
no money no weed its all been swapped for a pile of corpses
ok dont panic lets think about this
you can think about it for as long as you like
i am panicking and i am off mate
big chris is about to walk in to hatchets office
the door opens and out walks john odriscoll with a serious sunburn
i wont be seeing you again chris i have paid him every last penny
i am sure you have no one was accusing you of being dishonest john
off that you chris
how did you get your hands on these
he drops a vagina shaped penis massager realising that these are the guns he has been after
he then tries desperately to conceal his excitement
the boys had em
i know you like these things wondered if you wanted them
er yeah sure ill have em
was it any trouble getting the money
well not especially but they seem to of upset a few characters
have you counted the money
yeah its all there to the pound
they were going to pay then
it looks like
but who knows
the opportunity was there
in my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there
good job chris
chris exits pushing his wages into his inside packet
harry is ecstatic about the guns and starts chuckling to himself
the scousers watch big chris walk out of hatchets empty handed we gotta get those guns
this is dangerous shit dean we dont even know who lives in there
listen i dont care who lives in there all as i know its got to be preferable to death by hatchet
furry muff lets go
i hope this is the right move
its either that my old boys place and we lose a digit daily
i am going to call him
as if hell care
hell care all right
that was going to be his money
whether he cares about us is different
pass your phone
think about what youre going to say ed we are on thin ice
the two scousers with guns in hand creep their way up the stairs
theres only one door in front of them
dean gets ready to kick it open
gary leans against the wall and delivers a professionals style kick
harry is in his offtce playing with his guns
the phone rings
that you boy
on phone its ed if thats what you mean
its pay day aint it
on phone i wanted to talk to you about that
i bet you did
i have got half a million nicker sitting in front of me which means that some poor sod doesnt
you must have upset a few people boy
but that isnt really my concern is it
but what does concern me is the guns you had
i want to talk to you about that
get your arse over here now and i do mean now
ed puts the phone down after a pause
his state of shock is obvious to the rest of the lads
impatiently well what did he say
he said he thinks we have paid him and he wants to talk about those guns
what are you on about
listen if he has the guns he might have the money
i think we should go and see him
i think youre a sandwich short of a picnic mate you want to start making sense
we cut to a time lapse
hatchet puts down the phone while resting his bum on the front of his desk
he is ecstatic with the guns
he loads and plays with them aiming at imaginary moving birds
the door is suddenly kicked wide open and lo and behold there is a scouser standing in the door
dean has a thousand ugly thoughts flying through his troubled mind most of which are based an regretting the decision to kick this door in shit what the hell is
that and why is he holding a shotgun
hatchet realizes that the man standing in the doorway who is posed like de niro in the poster of taxi driver holding a gun in each hand has nor come
to deliver the mail
the pair are blissfully unaware that employee has met employer
hatchet harry has effectively contracted his own demise
the pause is eventually shattered by reality there is a rush to pull their individual triggers
there is a race between the two bullets to reach their prospective targets
both barrels are emptied into deans chest
the scourer is airborne by the sheer power of the cartridges
one of deans bullets finds its way into harrys shoulder
gary can do nothing to stop this atrocity
he watches helplessly as his pal flies clean past him
overtaken by emotion or fear gary charges in gun blazing and proceeds to perforate hatchet who is now unarmed
hatchet flies over his desk
gary comes into the room to finish the job and fires one last bullet into hatchet who is lying on the chair side of his desk
it is then revealed that barry is sitting in his chair behind the door
the scourer cant see barry and barry cant see garys face
barry throws the hatchet that is sitting next to him in a butchers block
it hits gary in the back
gary spins round firing wildly and lodges a bullet in barrys stomach
it is then clear to them both that this has all been a terrible mistake
what are you doing here
then both collapse into dead lumps on the floor
you and me tom
what do you mean me
they stand outside hatchets door and are just about to ring it when tom notices its open
oh jesus not again
the two pause while they build their confidence
they enter hatchet harrys room
its still smoky
there on the table is the money
thats it i am off
ed tiptoes over to the bag containing the money
tom this is our case
this is our money tom
now i think we should go
tom sees his guns
his eyes widen in surprise
ill meet you in the car
i am taking these guns
tom dont mess around lets go
i meet you in the car
ill only be a minute
a job well done son we made a few quid out of that one
as he puts the key in the ignition there is no reply from his little boy son
made a few quid did ya
now where is it
we cant see dog but we can see the sharp side of a knife resting along the front of little chriss throat
the dog is lying down in the back
big chris assesses the situation
you all right back there mate
very fucking funny
wheres what i want
its in an office i have just left it in the office
well you had better go and get it from the office
thats if you want to see your son reach his next birthday
now chop fuckin chop
all right furry muff
big chris doesnt seem too bothered by this problem
he shrugs and starts the car
what are you doing
well its a five minute walk or a thirty second drive
you had better be careful
big chris starts his car up looks across to make sure that little chris has got his seatbelt on and pulls out on to the road
he gets faster and faster until dog pokes him in the shoulder with his knife
chris pulls hard to the left and rams into the nearest parked vehicle
bang dog goes flying forward hitting the windscreen
another time lapse
well whats going on
i dont know but what i do know is that theres no more harry which means theres no more debt and if theres no more debt theres no more problem
and theres no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead
i think if i get this right we havent done anything wrong anyway which means we are in the clear
big chriss car hits them straight in the rear
the bag of cash goes flying through the car landing on the dash
the lads are knocked unconscious
big chris having removed the knife from a stunned dog proceeds to smash his head against the dash and has the most amount of fun in doing so
never never not as long as i can remember has anybody been as rude to me as you have
dog is being thrown around like a rag doll
we are looking through a two way mirror
dont think i wouldnt like to get rid of you but before i do i need to know whats going on edward
if you think youre in the dark i am in a black hole blindfolded
the camera spins round to see the traffic warden standing with a policeman
there is a long pause far consideration
eventually he shakes his head
no thats not one of them
the policeman then knocks on the door
the serg looks round to see the policeman
they exit and ed is left on his own
after a short pause the door bursts open
all right son youre outta here
and you want to stay outta here
all the lads are sitting in the bar
ed is talking to tom who is interested in whatever he has to say
the traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear
they got no case against us because there is no evidence against us
apart from those shotguns
and tom took care of them
pause while tom looks embarrassed about something
you did take care of the guns didnt you tom
ed looks at tom who looks even more embarrassed
i wanted to talk to you about that
well not exactly no i got em sitting in the car actually i thought we might sell them back to the greek but i am having a bit of a
problem getting hold of him
you dippy bastard
the only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside
we paid seven hundred quid for those guns
they could hardly trace them to you could they
i dont think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid
tom go and throw those guns off a bridge
and throw yourself off while youre at it
soap now tom
there is a pause
tom leaves looking a little sulky
the silly sod
big chris walks in
he approaches the bar
pause you come to collect something chris
should i have something for you
can i help
i think i can help you as it happens
i have got something for ya
well for your boy actually
well i suggest you speak to him then
they all look rather shocked
he is carrying their bag and he places it on the table which increases the shock factor
it seems that hatchet under estimated your lot and that seems to have cost him
i am not going to make the same mistake am i
i have decided to bring your bag back
the words you are looking for start with thank you
now you have presented me with a problem
i dont have an employer any more
so i have taken care of myself and my son and if you think that is unfair you just come and pay me a little visit but you better be
waving the white flag high and clear otherwise it will be the last little visit you lot ever make
thats all i had to say
its been emotional
big chris turns to walk out
the lads stare at the bag and then at each other
big chris walks out into the street
we see a shiny new sports car
little chris is sitting in the passenger seat
that should take care of that lot
we are now officially in the money loaning business all right son
all right dad
well put your seatbelt on then
ed goes forward to open the case
the rest are still in shock
ed opens the bag
theres nothing in it
what do you mean
i mean its fucking empty
bacon lunges forward and stares in
he sticks his hand in and extracts an a envelope
they look puzzled
ed feels the package and starts to tear the top off
as this is done it creates a split screen
on the other side of the picture tom is on a london bridge with the car boot open
he looks at the guns with regret and give them one last polish
then he folds the guns up and places them on top of a handrail
simultaneously ed extracts a sotherbys brochure on shotguns
they still look confused
they turn the brochure upside down and recognize the shotguns
slowly they start to turn the pages
torn pushes the shotguns over the top rail they fall
he starts walking but stops for some reason
he retreads his steps and peers over the guns had just fallen on to a shelf
ed sees the price of the guns a series of alarming zooms cut between eyes and prices
they panic and reach for their mobile phones
tom is climbing over the bridge now and has to hold on to the rail with one arm
ed starts screaming at the other two that the number is engaged and asks them to put their phones down
tom now had one hand on the guns and one on the rail
his mobile phone starts to ring in his top pocket he has either to drop the guns or let go of the rail to answer the phone
the shot freezes
