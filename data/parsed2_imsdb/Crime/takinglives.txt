seitz david ayer february small canadian rural
just the native american cashier jotting down sports stats from the paper
slight pale and frail new clothes a tag still hangs from his stiff work jacket
martin stands in front of the cashier a beat
nervously tugs an earlobe
sir may i have a ticket to montreal please
i need a ticket to montreal
forty three dollars
martin pulls out an envelope filled with crisp twenties and carefully counts out three
the cashier gives martin his ticket and change
points at a bus outside
the driver loading bags
a half dozen passengers
martin steps aboard takes a seat
dan soulsby martins age sits next to him offers a hand
nice to meet you
where you heading to
away from here
dan produces a couple beers from his pockets
offers martin one
at least its cold pisswater
heres to getting away
they clink cans
the driver enters the bus
unlocks the airbrakes
puts the bus in reverse gives it gas
the engine throws a rod
smoke wafts into the windows
the driver kills the engine
martin and dan trade looks
that was bad
bummed its gonna take all day to get another bus here
martin sighs looks out the window
a car rental place
martin fingers the envelope of cash in his pocket
you have a license
they took it away
i got one
journey on the radio
martin checks out dans guitar
dan shows martin his teeth
theyre all fake
you take a hockey puck in the face
my stepdad socked me
i flew across the room and dented the sheetrock in the kitchen
my mom saw everything and still took his side
you got cracked good
i hate that guy
two hundred pounds of worthless grease
whyd he hit you
i wrecked his sixty five mustang and his boat in the same week
i totaled them
i would have popped you too
it was worth it
but i didnt deserve the tour in hell
dan rubs his close cropped hair
dont ever go to military school if you can help it
a beat i jumped the wall two days ago
you going back
im done with that racket
im going to seattle and playing music
martin tries the guitar hes not that good
i know some chords
think you can learn drums
the land rolls endlessly
dan plays his guitar
hes really good
im the next billy squire
krokus will be opening for me one day
the car hits a bottle
a front tire deflates
martin guides the crippled vehicle to the curb
the middle of nowhere
martin flips a coin
dan hauls the spare from the trunk
sets the jack under the bumper
a pickup truck approaches
still a mile away
martin watches dan lean in the trunk for the tire iron
the pickup gets closer a big one
heavy with bags of animal feed
martin looking at dans back
martin shoves dan hard into the highway
in front of wham
it plasters dan
he goes over the hood shatters the front windshield
bounces off spins like a rag doll into a ditch
the pickup has lost control it rolls
several times a heaving mass of steel
the truck folds itself around a husky tree
no survivors thats clear
he cant believe what he has just done
he takes in the carnage tugs at his ear
establishing the river bound city
a large ferry plies the unstoppable waters
gliding toward skyscrapers
the signs in french
crowded with passengers waiting to board
as more passengers pour off the just docked ship
a woman runs through the crowd
terror etched in her face
she knocks aside several people
runs toward a row of restaurants
even in her turmoil she is patrician elegant
two beat cops eat at an outdoor table
the woman approaches them frantic
i just saw my dead son get off the ferry
the cops trade looks
listen to me hes been dead eighteen years
he just walked right past me
an inspector pours the woman tea
she has calmed down
he takes his pen looking at her statement
you need to open that grave
it cant be my son in there
i lost my mother two years ago
every day i think i see her
driving to work in the car next to me
shopping i see her but this is someone elses mother
the woman lays a hand on his arm looks him in the eye
there is something formidable about her
inspector im saddened by your loss and touched by loyalty
but lets focus on the matter at hand
he walked right past me
we made eye contact
i know he recognized me
it was my son
a mother knows these things
i will sign anything i will swear before a judge
and thank you i do have all my faculties and friends who can vouch for my character
did you talk to this man he is a man now
of course hes a man
hed be thirty two
and no i did not speak with him
low serious inspector my son was very very disturbed
he had serious emotional problems
i assure you he was
a beat is
is a dangerous person
he hands her some forms
the police department cannot resolve your problem
you need to get permits from the coroner and health and safety department
you pay for an exhumation
you have someone qualified examine the remains
if it is the wrong body the forensic examiner will confirm there is a problem and call us
then we open an investigation
a beat no quebec city police will investigate
he is buried there no
the woman bristles
stands takes the forms
he is not
in the mountains
near a roaring river
a log vacation cabin is being erected by construction a back hoe digs a trench
the scoop snags something a wetsuit worn by a long dead corpse twirling slowly hanging from the buckets steel teeth
the back hoe operator jumps off the huge machine stares at the headless body he has just dragged from its grave
workers gather and gawk
someone call the cops
inspector laval and inspector reynaud rock solid french canadians pin photographs of the body we just saw on the wall
laval steps back
takes in the display
subtitled french think she will like this
laval tosses him a newsweek
subtitled french we are lucky the fbi is sending her
she is the michael jordan of criminal profiling
off reynauds look the guy le fleuer of profiling
she will save our ass
the phone rings
subtitled french inspector laval
a beat have the airline check again
look around baggage claim
to reynaud she was on the flight but they cant find her
reynauds cell rings
into phone oui
reynaud grabs his coat
turns to laval
subtitled french i know where she is
we hear breathing and the soft rush of a river
two eyes open reflect moonlight
the footsteps drawing closer
a flashlight turns on
revealing grace vanderholt lies in the grave where the body was discovered
it has been excavated by criminologists the soil sifted the grass and brush removed
grace sits up
grace holds out her fbi creds shielding her eyes from the bright light
its okay im supposed to be here
the light goes off
revealing laval and reynaud
agent vanderholt we requested your help
im inspector laval this is inspector reynaud
look im not ready to talk to you guys yet
i need a little more time here
reynaud and laval trade looks walk toward two uniforms guarding the site
grace lays back down
concentrates on the sounds
wind in the trees
then laughter would you mind trading one liners somewhere else
i need to hear the natural sounds
i appreciate it
the policemen have gathered in a chummy knot
laval gestures for them to walk down the road
she steps out of the grave
sits by it
writes some notes
everything glistens in the moonlight alive
grace takes it in for a beat
then howling the lonely song of a distant wolf
grace rises crosses to the river to a big gravel bar
used as a campsite complete with a large fire pit
grace sits by the fire pit
more howling closer this time
grace looks down river sees the glowing eyes of a timber wolf staring from a clump of trees
the animal stares a beat then runs off
grace has the chills
grace walks quietly toward the trees
grace just a few feet away
she cautiously moves aside a sapling
a timber wolf nestled amidst the trees gnaws on something a human head
grace stands there alone the wolf is long gone
she stoops pushes aside brush
she finds a hollow under some roots
grace clicks on her flashlight
a human skull stares up from the hollow
picked clean weathered
laval and reynaud and the two uniforms smoke and joke
a quiet beat as the wind picks up
their cars up the road in the b
something moves in the woods
inspector reynaud draws his glock
shushes the men
laval signals for the men to spread out
holsters are unsnapped
reynaud is all eyes and ears as he picks his way toward the trees
grace emerges from the trees a laser aiming dot on her forehead
she reacts to reynaud raises her hands
dont shoot im on your team
reynaud holsters his gun
the men relax
grace takes inspector laval aside
call who you have to call
i found his head
gloved hands carefully remove the skull from a box
the medical examiner places the skull on an exam table and begins cleaning it
grace walks around the headless body
the wetsuit has been removed the body has been autopsied
headless skeletal hands the legs are surprisingly well preserved
director gillet is tall heavy smoking a cigar
hes a cops cop and all around nice guy
i cant tell you how excited we are to have you here
you only have one victim
usually theres two or three by the time i get called in
this case made page one of the globe
the tabloids say there is a headhunter on the loose
the mayor wants closure
thats his vacation house they were building
i get calls from supervisors i didnt know i had
you clear the mayor
we cleared the mayor
he read the article on you in newsweek and insisted we fly you up
the papers say two campers had a drunken fight and the loser lost his head
what do you think
i dont solve crimes anymore i balance budgets
this was not a heat of the moment killing
and the victim was buried complete with head
the grave was five foot ten
the victims height
with square corners
dug with a shovel the killer had the foresight to bring
thirty five detectives searched the area saturday
my investigators think youre a witch
ive been called worse
the medical examiner finds two small holes in the skull waves the photographer over
look at that looks like he got ice picked
she simulates fangs with her hands they match marks on the skull
a large canine did that
probably an old or sick timber wolf that couldnt hunt
it dug up the body and chewed off the head
it felt safe in the trees away from the riverbank away from the other wolves
the medical examiner looks at a chewed vertebrate
id say youre right
into tape recorder postmortem scavenger damage to c
the medical examiner examines the skulls teeth
the victim was afraid of dentists
inspectors laval and reynaud enter
both give grace wary nods
inspector laval hands the medical examiner a paper bag marked human remains
this was a meter from the skull
at soil level
the medical examiner opens the bag
removes a wig
no not a wig someones ponytail and leathered scalp
tangled with the hair is a braid of green nylon cord tied to two pieces of broomstick
the photographer snaps some shots
the medical examiner gingerly untangles the cord
look at this
grace crosses grins
grace studies the cord noting the intricate knots
thats your murder weapon
it might be trash a camper left
look at it braided parachute cord two pieces of broom stick
you approach the victim from behind loop it around his head and hold on for all your might
the more the victim struggles the quicker he passes out
and now you have convenient handles to drag around two hundred pounds of dead kayaker
that is a theory
thats exactly what it is
that evidence supports
when the suspect is in custody you can ask him yourself what happened and you wont need me
laval bristles he crosses to check his cell messages
gillet looks at grace at the cord
turns to her quietly
laval and reynaud are my stars
very smart very persistent investigators
on the street theyre magnificent
i can see that director
youre lucky to have them
go ahead director say what you have to say
youre the expert
if you have any suggestions on how to proceed
a forensic anthropologist can draw the victims face based on the skull
i know someone at quantico who can do it by tomorrow
we have people
then show the results to everybody around who was selling outdoor goods two years ago
you have his initials mrc inside the wetsuit
the long hair is distinctive someone may recognize him
its a semi long shot
no thats bread and butter detective work
checks his watch we should get upstairs
they cross to the exit
director gillet barks orders in french at his two star inspectors
photos maps newspaper articles cover the walls
twenty four hour news on a tv
six detectives man the phones
rookies fetch reports pour coffee
the long table is crowded
inspectors laval and reynaud
three more police officials
a pair of city councilmen
grace sits next to gillet
you found the skull
i had a case once where wild dogs had removed remains
so i can tell my people there isnt a headhunter running around the wilds of quebec
no headhunters sir
however a killer is out there
do you have the victim identified
no name yet sir
we have someone from the university recreating his face from the skull
why after two years has nobody reported him missing
he wasnt missed
he had no family or moved often
he had the musculature of a serious outdoorsman
he spent a lot of time in his kayak
the big question is who killed him
always is sir
i can give you a rough profile white male thirty to thirty four
has some college but no degree
neat in appearance
at least six feet tall
charming when necessary
he uses murder as a tool probably in furtherance of a criminal endeavor
hes killed before and will again unless caught
laval and reynaud write furiously
gillet is impressed
as are the councilmen
we really appreciate the fbi sending you
when can we expect your report
a couple days sir
grace writes notes on a yellow pad
inspectors laval and reynaud cross laval shows her an artists sketch of the victim
say hello to a dead man
insert sketch the victim has a deep stare rugged features long hair
good looking guy
this is more than we had
laval has declared peace
reynaud still keeps his distance
a very nice bed and breakfast
grace enters and finds her luggage waiting
she loves the room
grace finds a bottle of wine and a note from gillet
grace checks the mini fridge bingo
cracks a moosehead
her cell rings
into phone vanderholt
filtered we named the victim curtis kohler
the forensic dentist just verified the id
with a c
k o h l e r
the initials are for the montreal river company
kohler worked there as a guide three years ago
the owner remembers him because he stole the wetsuit
can you do a full records search
criminal credit commercial history
filtered yes of course
youre an awesome investigator inspector
run his name on every database you can
ill see you in the morning
grace hangs up
makes notes on the sketch
slips it into a picture frame
grace reynaud and laval look through a haystack of computer printouts for needles of information
grabs a donut from a box
offers the box to laval
fruit of the gods
you know you want one
laval gives in takes a plain cake
she offers donuts to reynaud
he rubs his eyes shoves aside papers quietly to laval subtitled french lets take her down the street
i will not eat one of those hockey pucks
lets go down the street
very good food
we are inviting you
grace grabs her jacket and an armful of reports
the inspectors favorite spot they are like family here
grace laval and reynaud at a table in back
covered with reports and plates
grace stops reading
tosses aside a printout
kohler has been dead two years
no doubt about that
very solid time of death
two years ago
so before he died he got his paychecks paid his taxes
patronized sporting goods stores
and had long spending gaps where he was enjoying the great outdoors
that pattern continues a year after his death
he gets some paychecks
rents an apartment
buys a three thousand dollar kayak
pays his taxes
dead and buried and still paying his taxes
then everything stops
last visa charge was to travelocity for a plane ticket to mexico city
dead men dont pay their bills
its identity theft
this isnt someone renting limos and fancy dinners on someone elses credit
lifestyle and habits dont change
too many independent systems
beat we work organized crime sometimes maybe a hit man wanted to lay low
he assumed the life of a civilian until things cooled off
you really think a gangster is going to break his stride and become a long hair groovy river guide
inspector this guys whole life has been stolen
someone killed him and became him
down to profession and taste in clothing
laval and reynaud trade looks
the lights are still on grace has fallen asleep on her bed still in her clothes paperwork everywhere
case photos now fill the picture frames cover the walls even on the ceiling
knocking at the door
crosses to the door groggy
she checks the peephole
cracks the door
its inspector laval
you are a heavy sleeper
whats up laval
a man was killed tonight
attacked from behind
asphyxiated with a nylon cord with handles
and theres a witness
or a suspect
were not sure yet
we should go
cop cars everywhere
crime scene tape
the coroners van
a couple news cameramen
grace crossing with laval
reynaud places a handcuffed man in workout gear in the back of a cop car
he says he saw the killer
reynaud slaps the cop car it quickly drives away
grace and laval arrive at a body dressed in sweats
a gym bag nearby
a pair of uniforms stand guard as a criminalist processes the body
thirty ish healthy his generic looks marred by bulging bruised eyes
grace squats by the body
clicks on her mag lite and inspects the victim
bruises on his neck
hes still warm
grace shines her flashlight along the corpse
a couple hairs glow in the strong light beam
want to get those
the criminalist takes a lint roller collects the hairs
where is it
under his car
grace shines her light under a car
a garrote is there made of broomsticks and knotted nylon cord
has le directeur been notified
im letting the poor man sleep a couple more minutes
pointing things out twenty four hour gym is there next door
he has a membership card in his wallet
thats his car
grace looks around the garage
taking it all in
getting a feel for the scene
she carefully examines the victims car with her flashlight
the door has been brushed with black print dust
director gillet sips bad coffee in a rumpled suit and t shirt
looking through a two way mirror
grace reynaud are with him
is that our killer
so far he checks out as an art dealer from winnipeg
john costa sits at the small table
glasses moppish hair
laval sits across from him
costa is sincere and frightened
i walk out of the gym
walk to my car
im unlocking it and i hear a scuffle a fight
over by this car i see this guy getting choked from behind and i shouted
what did you shout
i ran towards them
then the person doing the choking lets go and pointed a gun at me and ran
im so stupid
i could of been shot
i called the police gave him cpr until the paramedics came
you touched him
i was giving him cpr
you removed the garrote
the thing around his neck
i took it off it was choking him
did you see where the attacker went
away from me
what kind of gun did he have
frustrated the kind that puts really big holes in people
was it black
was it silver
i am getting information
he had a large black handgun
listen to me
i can draw a picture of his face
i saw him
you want to draw a picture
i can sketch him
im very good
how could you see his face in the dark
costa realizing he is under suspicion
he leans forward looks inspector laval in the eye
i did not do this
i saw two guys fighting and should of ran the other way but i didnt
as if to a child you need to find the person who killed this man
in french you need to find the guy who did this
grace doesnt like the turn
you need to confirm hes a suspect or clear him and kick start a manhunt based on costas id
if he is a legit witness hell get heated up and start forgetting details
i think theres a way to clear him without pissing him off
grace knocks on the interview room door
i need a moment with you
laval exits the room shutting the door behind them
a rookie hands director gillet a cup of coffee and a new dress shirt wrapped in plastic
i was getting into his mind
i have a shortcut
can you get any of his school transcripts
its all on line
grace takes an evidence bag containing the garrote from the latest crime scene
she drops it in her computer bag
grabs a case file
call the winnipeg police and have them fax or e mail his drivers license photo
grace crosses opens the door enters
john costa smiles at grace as she enters
sets her bag on the floor
the case file on the desk
i hope you guys are playing bad cop smart cop
im the dumb one
call me grace
she slides typing paper and a pencil over to costa
he had these real intense eyes
costa about to start drawing
before you do that i need some personal information from you
can you write down the name of the elementary school you attended
and your elementary school teachers as many as you can remember
costa looking at grace a beat
are you kidding me
lady i saw someone get killed tonight and youre asking me about grade school
i apologize i know its random but its the best way you can help me
i dont remember any of that
youd be surprised
writing i attended two
holy trinity and mother of good counsel
i remember sister bernard
i dont know father jeffrey
oh and mrs
sebastien she had a glass eye
she takes the list of names
she tips over her briefcase with her foot the evidence bag spills out
costa glances at the garrote reacts
thats it isnt it
the thing around his neck
costa looking at grace realizes its a mind game
i told the other guy ill tell you
i did not do this
i saw who did this and i can show you what he looks like and you can go catch him
costa is unambiguously sincere
graces attitude softens a bit
she tucks the garrote back in her bag
go ahead and draw the face of the man you saw
costa draws a simple smiley face
he shows her
well get an artist to help you
i can draw him thank you
grace crosses to the door
costa begins drawing in earnest
grace emerges from the interrogation room
reynaud hands her a printout of costas school records
grace checking costas list against his transcripts
you left a file in there
see if he tries to peek in it
the real killer couldnt resist
hell want to know what we know
laval watches costa
costa draws with skilled hands delicate but strong
the file is ignored
grace hands laval back costas file
can you remember any of your grade school teachers
he remembered three
a rookie crosses with a photo hands it to laval
heres his provincial drivers license photo
hes checking out
laval shows grace the photo
it is definitely costa
have a nurse take a dna sample
just to make sure his dna isnt in the victims car or anything weird
well run the tests
costa has finished the sketch
he holds it up to the mirror for those he assumes are watching
reflected in the two way mirror is costas sketch
cold piercing eyes chiseled features
the door opens expecting grace costa is disappointed to see a tough looking paramedic unwrapping a cotton swab
please open your mouth
the sketch is taped to the dashboard now labeled unknown assailant
the cops cruise the business district eyeballing the arriving office workers
grace slams an espresso shot as she reads the globe
this is his personal space tons of hockey paraphernalia
a couple tired easy chairs
the medical examiner eats a slice of pizza
grace studies an evidence bag containing a mans ring
fell out of his t shirt when i removed the clothing
it doesnt fit the victim
off the ring wvss
west vancouver secondary school class of
not the victims
i called the school and had someone find them in a yearbook
heres the original owners name
but it could have been through a dozen pawn shops since then
he hands her a piece of paper
grace has a big smile
doctor can i take you back to quantico with me
i must remain where the hockey is good
grace hands the paper to reynaud
reynaud and grace crossing through the parking lot
into radio subtitled french this is special unit fourteen
i want a complete name search
surname is edwards
can we swing by the crime scene before we head back
reynaud nods yes
they get in his unmarked car
tape still up
the hour gym is closed for the day
grace looking around
laval studies a shrine of candles on the sidewalk
grace sneaks up on him
she gets real close
laval watches the candles burn
cmere a second please
they cross to the victims car
borrow your keys
stand there like youre going to choke me
grace pantomimes unlocking the door drops the keys and reaches for her throat
keys drop straight down howd they end up over there under that car
they were kicked
during the struggle
kick them as hard as you can that way
laval looks at her kicks his keys
not even halfway
grace crosses to the candles
i had this case
this young hundred pound woman was abducted from a parking lot
she kicked off a mirror broke a window dented her door
everything you are saying you are saying one thing do we trust costa
do we trust costa
an unmarked car pulls up
grace and laval get in reynaud guns it
grace belts in
i found a current address here in montreal
reynaud leans on the horn aggressively maneuvering through traffic
you guys have an extra weapon
i didnt want to cross the border armed
the glove box
grace opens it and finds a compact glock
she checks it shoves it into her pocket
reynaud swerves into the wrong lane
stops cold in front of an apartment building
and gets out
a mere two blocks away from the crime scene
laval gets out
an upper floor
grace reynaud and the manager cross to a door
the manager studies costas sketch of the attacker
i never met him
we conducted our business by phone
they arrive at a door
reynaud about to knock
grace stops him listening at the door
i smell smoke
back where im from anyone can kick a door if theres a fire
its the citizens arrest of search warrants
then the smoke alarm inside the apartment buzzes o
reynaud and laval trade looks
reynaud cocks a leg
the manager unlocks the door a beat before reynaud kicks it
laval is no danger junkie hes a little hesitant to enter
grace gets down low enters carefully she knows what shes doing
its dark drawn shades
a small studio
reynaud and grace move tactically with drawn guns
grace enters the kitchen
reynaud approaches the futon a person sized shape under the blankets
reynaud whips aside the blanket
grace checks under the sink
reynaud checks the bathroom and shower
a coffee pot smokes sizzling sludge on the bottom
grace checks around the fridge now satisfied no one lurks in there
grace turns off the burner
she crosses to a window whips aside the curtains and opens it
got a lung full
grace looks at a glass of orange juice a half eaten plate of food on the table
looks like this guy ran out in the middle of breakfast
laval has entered he stares out the window
grace looks out the window reacts
the apartment window has a perfect view of the gym parking lot where the killing occurred
reynaud sees that and also reacts
we should get out of here
dont touch anything
they back out of there
grace watches a criminalist bag a comb from the medicine cabinet
a couple hairs entwined in its teeth
in the kitchen another criminalist dusts for prints
reynaud taking pictures with a large still camera
laval knocks on the walls
laval moves a picture frame
a photograph falls out
laval picks it up with surgical gloves
insert photo a dead ringer for costas sketch carousing in a thai bar
laval shows grace
resembles the man costa sketched
beat have you released him
you dont want your star witness steaming in a holding cell
he went home twenty minutes ago
agent grace where do you think monsieur edwards is
i bet monsieur edwards is in a deep grave with square corners like messieurs kohler and ford
which looks like all the victims
maybe hes subconsciously killing himself
grace finds a guitar case
its a mobile office it has postage stamps
assorted stationery different address labels
a cd titled learn flamenco guitar
hundreds of practice signatures
victims personal effects
well take that with us
in french put a number and seal on that case
reynaud snaps pictures of the guitar case
grace is absorbing everything this little apartment can tell her
bonding with the space
she smells a pillow
ever see a hermit crab
its a crab that lives in the shells of dead sea snails
they have one big claw and curl up tight
laval takes a long sharpened screwdriver from his jacket
begins prying off a door molding
grace sits at the kitchen table
when they outgrow an old shell they search for a new empty shell crawl up to it and quickly switch
they live in these beautiful shells because they have these soft ugly bodies
they couldnt survive without the shells
neither can the guy were after
laval exposes several mini dv and micro cassettes hidden under the molding
surprisingly clear video shot with a long night vision lens
todd ford exits the hour gym gets in his car
the director grace reynaud and laval watch the video on the tv
director gillet turns it off
he is not in a good mood and that has laval and reynaud on edge
we could have had him this morning
we are getting close
the hairs recovered from the apartment match the hairs recovered at the crime scene on fords body
we found hours of video like that of the victim
he has been following him filming him for weeks
he tapped his phone and has recordings of fords calls
even a cd with copies of mr
fords e mail folders
with that much detail you could become anyone
so he hunts people and wears their lives as a kind of trophy
more like a kind of camouflage
whats his real name
we know what he looks like we have his fingerprints we know what he had for breakfast
but his name eludes us still
angry find it laval
laval and reynaud quickly exit
director gillet and grace walk down the hall
theyre working really hard
someone died last night because the asshole were after isnt in custody
its happened to me before and im sure it will happen again
its a pretty miserable feeling
i havent felt it in a long time
a beat dinner
i promised the boys id hang out tonight
grace reynaud and laval have mussels and beer
laval watches the guitarist a little melancholy
im fair and i keep my promises
my informants trust me
i have eyes on the trains on the buses
if they see him they will tell me
subtitled french maybe they will tell you
why do you trust junkies
makes a fist i trust their fear of this
subtitled french dont say that in front of her
subtitled french its okay
i was a street cop in philadelphia for three years before i joined the fbi
grace speaks french
as does laval
you like to play games
ford worked as a cruise ship musician
he would walk around and play his guitar on the decks at night
life is pretty cold sometimes
mans just trying to spread a little music and gets murdered
he targeted mr
ford the night before he was supposed to get on a plane and meet a ship in aruba
only the new improved mr
ford was going to meet he ship
think he has a plan b
i doubt it
hes been so meticulous and effective in the past i bet hes never needed one
we can assume he has all sorts of fake ids and passports
but thats not enough for him he has to be someone else
he gets off impersonating people
and he knows his current persona is compromised
laval and reynaud have stopped eating are looking at her
youre always thinking
save something for tomorrow
we have three boxes of evidence to go through
pretty cavalier attitude for a man who just got his ass chewed by his boss
my papa dropped dead of a heart attack in front of a drill press at work
laval clinks her beer reynaud too
im dropping by costas i still have a couple questions
off lavals look i cant turn it off
a warm night people are out
some old men argue politics
grace approaches the gallery keeping a low profile as she finds an angle to look inside
john costa shares some merlot with a statuesque elegant woman
shes laughing flirting
costa is making her laugh
grace quickly crosses to the entrance
an older man joins them the woman is his arm candy
costa shakes his hand
the older man and the elegant woman exit
costa sees her reacts genuinely glad to see her
and that throws grace a beat
she really likes his smile
you caught me
grace looks over the art
toussant jean bernard
i met him in haiti last year
very troubled life
outlived all his children
and he had ten
he lost his wife to cancer and went blind
passed away last year
overpriced folk art
is it the work of a soul that has suffered
are his explorations as an artist groundbreaking
and i was going to send you two and charge them to your amex
i couldnt afford it
costa is looking at her looking through her
what about daddys amex
ive sold quite a bit of art to poor little rich girls like you
grace grows tense
try the wine
im partial to beer
and i dont have long
i came by to thank you for your help
and i apologize if you were detained
you did the right thing
trying to save him
why thank you
gives her a card im having a show friday
you should come by and meet some good people
whered you learn cpr
before i dropped out
i had a moment of clarity in anatomy class i realized id rather draw bodies than cut them up
and when i realized i couldnt make art i decided to sell it
its taken me all over the world
about monday again did you see mr
ford fighting back
at first i thought i was interrupting something you know
no i dont
i thought they were hugging
then the gun came out when he saw me
i guess thats it
grace hands him a card
if you remember any details or need anything
off his look anything related to the case please call me
think about friday
grace will she exits
grace has turned the romantic little room into a cave of paperwork
notes and photos cover the walls
grace reads a phone bill taped to a lamp
circles a number that keeps reappearing
the place is gearing up for a new day
grace crosses to where laval and reynaud struggle awake with coffee and the morning paper
grace takes a seat grabs the sports section
a young detective eats a grapefruit
can you run this name
she got twenty hang up calls from edwards phone
the young detective takes a post it from grace and crosses
what happened to that beautiful thumbprint on the orange juice glass you get an id
hes never been fingerprinted
any activity on edwards accounts
i think he became edwards a year ago
he was a software engineer
did everything by the internet he never met anyone face to face
grace trades reynaud for the front page
why a year ago
edwards went on a river trip
kohler was a guide
laval tosses her some papers
those are e mails between kohler and edwards discussing the trip one year ago
you connected edwards and kohler
somebody was working all night
i couldnt sleep
our suspect kills kohler on the river lives his life a year kills edwards and assumes his id for a year
then he stalks ford kills him but is interrupted by costa
think hes pissed at costa
the young detective returns with a report hands it to grace
agent vanderholt a report came back on the name
laval drives fast through a neat modest neighborhood
grace marveling at the police report
she must have sounded like a total fruitcake
this is it
grace watching laval
he looks pretty rough this morning
let me go and be non threatening
knocking on the front door
the woman from the ferry answers the door
her name is rebecca asher
she opens the door smiles warmly at grace
hi please come in
thank you for coming
grace sips earl grey
admires the impressive antiques
im glad they finally sent someone those hang up calls have me terrified
they started right after i saw him
a beat i looked him directly in the eye
there was a moment of mutual recognition
do you think its martin calling and hanging up
it couldnt sound crazier but who else
were you ever asked to identify his body
yes they showed me some remains that had been hit by a pickup truck
the upper body was crushed
there was no face
i got physically ill
asher studies grace
youre not canadian are you
im with the fbi
grace shows her creds
there was three
about two weeks ago
i began turning off my telephone when i go to bed
you have some very nice things mrs
some of them have been in my family for several generations
please call me rebecca
grace looking at pictures on the wall of a good looking athletic kid
they stop at age fourteen
is that martin
martins older brother
he drowned in a terrible accident
grace notes a photo of a smiling young reese receiving a long distance swimming trophy
im so sorry rebecca
how did he drown
the san michel river
martin fell out of their raft and reese jumped in to save him
there was a lot of snowmelt that year
martin reached the bank
it was their fourteenth birthday
their fourteenth birthday
they were twins
you said reese was older
by three minutes
they were very different boys
to lose one son so young then to lose the other two years later to think youve lost him
that must have been devastating
asher lights a cigarette
crosses to the window so poised so tragic
grace studies her with a critical eye
reese was very charismatic and outgoing
martin was introverted
he never thrived like reese
he was a very disturbed young man
reese was martins world
martin never recovered his equilibrium after we lost him
martin began to intimidate me
he could be very menacing
he began imitating reese at school and that lead to fights with other students
at sixteen he stole some jewelry that was very precious to me and ran away
a few days later the thunder bay police called and said my son had been killed changing a tire
the police want you to sign this so they can exhume the body in martins grave and verify identity
asher takes the paper
ill sign it
i already know somebody elses son is in that casket
the phone rings
asher crosses to the kitchen and answers
grace looking around takes a look down a hallway
asher chats with a friend
grace pokes her head in looks around
nothing of note
the door opens and grace peers in
flowing silk throw pillows like a sultans tent
grace opens the door
more laughter o
a bed still made
an r on the headboard
on the other side shadows on the wall where pictures used to hang
indents in the carpet
where a bed used to be
graces brow furrows
martin has been erased
sees a diminutive doberman snarling at her
the miniature hound guards a door
a door with several locks
grace takes a step toward it
the tiny dog bares its fangs
grace reaches for a deadbolt
the little dog growling
one deadbolt is open
grace opens the other one
grace cracks the door
darkness stairs leading to the basement
the bathroom is there
asher is right behind her
i was snooping
grace closes the door
asher escorts grace away past the boys room
re the boys room my friends call it the shrine
it can be difficult to let go
hes killing people isnt he
grace nods yes
asher assumed as much
that doesnt surprise you
grace gets in
laval shaving with an electrical razor
laval pulls out
that lady is definitely a queen without a country
i should have curtsied
watches him shave hygiene on the road
the razor dies
leaving laval half shaven
grace trying not to laugh hands him a form
a back hoe rips a bucket of earth from amidst the graves
a couple uniforms watch
a cheap wood coffin sits on a gurney
the lid has been removed
grace laval and reynaud peer inside and react
reynaud looks ill
could be worse after getting run over by a pickup and twenty years in the ground
the body has been moved to the exam table
covered with mold the corpse seems to be upholstered with baby blue velvet
the medical examiner checks the scale
bodies get mixed up all the time
police found the wallet called the mother and nothing was cross checked
this was his head
medical examiner pulls a plastic bag from the coffin
slices it open revealing skull fragments and teeth
passes them off to an assistant
to the assistant get that to doctor shivani and make sure someone signs for it
to grace shell rebuild his jaw line and check it against martin ashers dental x rays
how soon sir
shrugs this is a priority case this afternoon maybe
five xl sized cops pump iron before their shift
shes doing sit ups on a decline bench holding a pound plate to her chest
shes a machine
the cops cant help but to be impressed
graces cell rings
she doesnt stop does sit ups faster
at the last second she answers
into phone panting vanderholt
filtered am i interrupting something
the x rays dont match
find the real martin asher
hes your killer
a beat you better get his mother someplace safe
an unmarked parked with laval and grace inside
they watch mrs
asher checking in
howd she finagle a room there
shes a very slick woman
she didnt have one picture of martin
even cut him out of the old yearbooks
and she had a basement door like a vault
shes hiding something
in the basement of her house
what is it ten minutes away from here
laval looks at grace decides he can trust her
if shes under our protection and something happens to her house her belongings the department could be liable
there could be a lawsuit
we should make sure her front door is locked
laval makes a u turn
the front door opens
revealing grace and laval as he pockets a lockpick gun
ill stay outside
kill him if hes in there
yeah ill get em
grace enters with a flashlight and a pistol
she cautiously clears each room until she is sure she is alone
grace crosses to the hallway
the little dog is there
grace tosses it a hamburger patty
lets be friends
the dog happily attacks its treat as grace opens the deadbolts on the door the little dog was guarding
grace descends creaking stops
shining her light around
grace is looking for something and shes not sure what
she spots a door chain
she moves some boxes
finds a leather razor strop hanging next to a small door
graces hand undoes the chain
lifts the latch and opens the door as rusted hinges squeal
grace moves aside cobwebs with her big flashlight
the room is tiny
exposed joists overhead
grace sits on the cold concrete
a sleeping bag rolled in the corner
one wall is just chicken wire
her flashlight beam stabs at the yawning darkness beneath the house
there is a public school desk chair combo
the name martin neatly carved into it then scratched out
a broken light bulb overhead its wires running to a corner of the house
grace cautiously unrolls the sleeping bag
a pair of socks underwear t shirt neatly folded inside
she rolls it back up
finds a large jar picks it up
very old feces inside a makeshift toilet
she sets it down
grace pulls the door shut
and turns off her flashlight
she sits there in the musty little cage
listening to her breathing to her heart beat
so lonely so frightening
a tear rolls down her cheek
she sniffles wipes away the tear
grace hears scratching
she clicks on her light
young martin asher is huddled in the corner shivering crying and whimpering
martin looks at us with haunted eyes
grace reacts nothing is there
chuckles for scaring herself
grace feels the chicken wire
something moves closer
she swings her flashlight on two fiery eyes
something big slams into the chicken wire
teeth flashing growling
its a badger
grace almost shoots it
the fearless beast growls
grace kicks the door open and runs out of there
laval driving back to montreal
grace is shaken
i think i just shaved ten years off my life
ah you do feel fear
rabies scares me
her cell rings
into phone vanderholt
someone broke into my office
at the art gallery
my office here
are they still there
did you call the police
you told me to call you if anything happened
well be right there
im sending a car
dont touch anything
two police cruisers screech to a stop outside
wooden painting crates everywhere
a table saw for making frames
costa is distressed
grace looking at a message typed onto his computer screen
i do all my calls to europe and shipping stuff at night
my address book was on the screen when i went out for coffee
i came back and this was on the screen
how long were you gone
when i returned that was on the screen
reynaud takes a picture of the screen
laval checking the doors lock
finds no marks
gives costa a look
is this about the strangling
is that guy after me
please relax mr
we dont know if theres a connection yet
is anything missing
a beat shit
he took my organizer and my business checkbook
grace nods for laval to step outside with her
grace and laval
how do we know costa didnt stage this
for attention or something
hes happy to see you
but the alarm was jumpered
do you think costa knows how to jumper an alarm
we should take the computer
costa who has followed them out overheard
dont take the computer
thats my brain
costa turns to grace
im not making this up
grace shrugs sees an atm facing the alley
should i believe you
grace crosses to the atm
peers into its security camera
or should i believe this
believe what you want
hes cocky grace likes that
being fast forwarded
costa exits his office
locks the door
he walks toward camera and exits frame
a mans silhouette in the alley
crossing towards the office door
an atm customer blocks the shot
the atm customer moves on
nobody is there
then martin asher exits costas office
closes the door
approaches camera nonchalant
his face is clear the piercing eyes the sharp features
asher exits frame
fast forward some more until costa enters frame and crosses to his office with a cup of coffee
the video stops
freezes on asher
costa grace laval and reynaud
costa stands there looking at ashers image on the video monitor
is that the man you saw choking mr
fear flashes across costas face
i must of walked right past him
costa is that the man you saw kill mr
ford in the parking lot
that is the man i saw murder todd ford in the parking lot outside my gym
now will you go catch him please
i just needed you to say it
who is this guy
hes like a ninja
sneaking into my office
how dangerous is he
does he want to kill me
john no harm will come to you
listen to me
no harm will come to you
anyone who wants to hurt you will have to get through these two for starters
she gestures at laval and reynaud
costa turns to them
how many people have you killed
you will be safe my friend
we want you to be there tonight
a beat costa smiles
realizes shes serious
im not meeting him
you ever go fishing
the bait always dies
he wont get within fifty feet of you
the second we see him the cuffs go on
adamant grace no
costa gives grace a look as reynaud tapes a microphone to the body armor he is wearing
what if he shoots me in the head
i will take the bullet for you like the secret service
reynaud is serious
grace helps costa with his shirt
you could move a lot of art if you wanted to
their eyes meet for a beat
and inspire some too im sure
right then something very rare happens grace blushes
the dance floor throbs with clubgoers
the dj thumps a eurobeat
costa sits at the bar
people all around him jostling to buy drinks
two busy bartenders sling booze
costa finds the noise and crowd absolutely nerve wracking
he twirls the ice in his scotch with a finger
staring at the clock
hes nervous sweat beads his forehead
a big bartender an undercover cop pours costa a scotch
youre doing fine
could you look any more like a cop
could i have some water
im cooking in this thing
costa scratches around the neck of the hot body armor
the bartender gives him a dasani
various angles a half dozen undercovers are mixed in with the clubgoers
camera finds reynaud sitting at the bar near costa gives costa a reassuring nod through the crowd
parked outside the club
grace and laval watch costa via the tv built into the dash
costa fits ashers choice of victims
travels the world looking for art
no kids or anything
looking around ashers here somewhere
with all the patience in the world
i wish i had his patience
he should be a cop
his mother should be punished
like the owner of pit bulls that attack kids
you got kids
dont keep them in a cage
costa looks miserable
overheating anxiously nursing his water
he looks around
a note sits on the bar top
right in front of him
costa looks around
only sees strange faces
costa carefully unfolds the note
it reads meet me in costa walks down a narrow hallway
red light bulbs hanging from the ceiling
approaching the mens room costa looks over his shoulder
no one is watching
costa cautiously pushes open the door
the room seems empty
costa swallows bends down
checks under the stalls
at the far stall
a pair of mens shoes
facing the stall door
backs away as
the stall door slowly swings open
a foot a trouser cuff
a leg stepping out
a black man emerges
one of the guys at the end of the bar
a bundle of nerves
costa eyes him
were calling it off
costa bursts from the fire exit fed up
he rips off the wire he struggles out of the body armor
grace and laval watching
i have a life
i cant play superhero for you
i dont handle stress very well
i have an art show to open tomorrow and i dont know what im putting on the walls yet
i know you have a life
so did the people who have lost theirs
someone else might die if you do not help us
every time someone dies it affects forty fifty lives
costa looks at her arms on his hips
grace ive been cooperating
i even drew you a picture
you cant put your responsibility on me
you have a badge not me
if somebody else dies and you know you could have done more to stop it youre going to feel like shit for a very long time mr
that resonates with costa
i want to help you guys but i dont have time to hang out and listen to bad techno
its okay to be scared
im off the charts terrified
theres a pissed off serial killer after me
i mean what did i do to him
you saw him and thats enough
dont stop living your life
youll be protected by armed officers twenty four seven
until hes caught
softly i cant promise you that
costa is torn grace empathizes with him
i have a lot of work to do
a car is watching the gallery
youll be okay
costa looking at grace
he decides to trust her
director gillet leans against a wall smoking a pipe
grace laval reynaud sit on the tired couches
so who was in ashers grave
he went missing from the alberta military institute two days before the accident
im sure soulsbys death was a homicide asher saw the opportunity and took it
he became soulsby and bummed around seattle for a couple years
why is asher after costa
why isnt he in mexico getting a new face
costa saw him
costa caught him in the act caught him being martin asher
seen first by his mother then by costa
for the first time hes failed at taking a life and since we found the apartment he cant be edwards
to be seen to be recognized is a horrifying thing to asher
he has no identity and wants it that way
where is the real mr
likely dead and buried south of the border somewhere
beat south of the american border somewhere
visa records put asher using kohlers id and edwards at a mexican surf resort
edwards last charge was sixteen hundred dollars at a no questions asked facelift clinic in guadalajara
director gillet taps out his pipe
looks at a new more detailed portrait of asher
have you contacted the clinic
they are also no questions answered
kohler suddenly paid off his credit card bills thanks to money from edwards
keeps the collection agencies off the trail
how do we flush mr
hes focused on costa
who fits the profile of ashers victims
he went on costas computer and e mailed copies of costas files to an e mail account in denmark
constant threat of discovery asher will become more disorganized
laval and reynaud agree
my office will arrange a press conference
i will tell a room full of correspondents we have a suspect who is dead and murder victims who are alive
and ill sound like a madman
it does sound crazy
thats what the press likes sir
director gillet stands tall before a podium
blinded by lights
a bouquet of microphones in his face
beside him is a haunting poster sized portrait of martin asher
asher we know who you really are
we will find you and we will arrest you
you can hide no longer
posters advertise summerfest
city workers put up barricades and porto potties
two carpenters uncrate and hang paintings
lost in thought
he studies a series of vivid paintings leaning against the wall
changes the order
something isnt right
costa some men in that car have been watching this place all morning
the carpenters looking out the window
theyre protecting the art
go ahead and hang those
be very careful
costa hears a police radio
grace and reynaud have entered
costa is apprehensive
grace gives him a reassuring smile
security is going to be very solid tonight
she waves him out of earshot of the carpenters
their faces are close
grace gets butterflies
is he going to show up tonight
what do i do offer him a drink
he wont show
but we want to be here in case he does
four plainclothes officers will form a perimeter watching the four corners
a perimeter excellent
and four plainclothes officers will be in here
i dont need four bruisers crashing through my clientele
the officers will be very discreet
we wont interfere with your thing
with my thing
will you be mingling
if you feel safer
summerfest a street festival is just warming up
it could be mardi gras plastic cups and glowsticks
a cutting edge club feel
a dj spins a captivating mellow mix
the gallery is filled patrons abuzz with chit chat
inspector laval and reynaud study the patrons
subtitled french this painting costs more than my house
reynaud shakes his head
shes stunning and shy about it
she examines a painting
a gentle hand touches her back
he hands her a highball
you look a little anxious
re her dress this isnt me
its all you
grace gives costa a look
she sips her drink nods at the painting
im trying to get into the show but i mean
what is this
it looks like somebody napalmed the garden of eden
ripe mangos hanging on a branch
now she sees it
why the borders
almost every painting has one
was he in prison or something
costa reacts impressed by grace
most people dont notice
this is from his prison series
he could see a mango grove through his cell window
he made some of the pigments himself
from his own blood
what was his crime
he attacked his neighbor with a machete
there was a woman involved
grace sips her drink letting herself relax
she enjoys costas company
he had a lot of lovers didnt he
he was a consumer of lifes pleasures
now hes dead and you get rich
his children formed a corporation i take ten percent
im not a buccaneer grace
grace looks at costa and smiles
i dont think ive ever met anyone quite like you
youre very sensitive for
an fbi agent
the elegant woman spots costa and crosses
she lays a hand on costas shoulder
he turns and they kiss cheeks
john its amazing tonight
i want to cry im so touched
grace watches her hand linger on costas arm
and is amazed that she feels jealous
she catches costas eye
costa i would like to discuss an arrangement for the series
the elegant woman reacts
just a sec john
she crosses to the older man in b
costa is miffed
what are you doing
shes not writing the checks
the elegant woman returns with the older man
he grabs costas hand
john its incredible what youve put together
aside to costa the thing we were talking about the other day well id like to proceed
hell im sick of making two percent in the market
dick theyre yours
the older man smiles shakes costas hand
the elegant woman looking at grace arms crossed enjoys her victory
grace plays along stalks off hiding a grin
a few minutes later costa finds grace at the turntables looking through the djs records
dont you miss wax
you helped me close the biggest sale of the night
whats my cut
what do you want
grace smiles coyly
i dont know
costa looks at grace for a long beat
not sure what her game is or if he wants to play
let me know when you do
costa walks away
grace reacts she didnt want that
costa takes a leak
hes in a good mood
the window above the stalls is open
the noise of the partying crowd on the sidewalks outside
costa finishes washes his hands
smoothes his hair
costa looks in the mirror and reacts
martin asher stares at him from the mirror
no doubt who it is
asher is wound tight not at all happy
put your hands on the wall
asher jams a gun in costas back
costa is very scared
please be cool with that
i dont wanna get hurt
i should blow your spine out
my face is everywhere
i have to hide in the shadows like a fucking animal because of you
i apologize for everything you think i may have done
were moved past sorry
you ruined everything
john soon to be dead costa
ashers eyes flash
asher slams costas face into the mirror
costas nose bleeds
reynaud stands near the bathroom
he heard that
he approaches the door tests the knob
the door opens
costa hits the deck
asher spins aims at reynaud and fires
pop pop pop pop
reynaud drops and rolls out of the line of fire
asher bursts from the bathroom running right over reynaud who draws his pistol
grace pulls a pistol laval too
asher running through the patrons
grace takes a knee and aims
she doesnt have a clear shot
asher aims his gun straight ahead as he runs
people hit the deck
out of my way
asher shoots a window shattering it
he shoulders his way through the safety glass
grace and laval follow
summerfest is in full swing
a swirling boiling crowd of shiny faces
asher dives into their midst
grace plunges in after him
inspector laval follows
costa is stunned reynaud checks him for bullet holes
from reynauds radio filtered subtitled french jean he ran into the damn crowd
reynaud bolts out of there
asher and his pursuers leave a wake of disturbed revelers that reynaud follows
careening rolling bouncing off people
he has the tireless power of a soccer player
locked onto asher like a missile
grace is slowly gaining on asher
laval behind her
screaming in his radio
subtitled french were heading east
form a line at seychelles
a dozen uniforms charge through the crowd
police radios busy with chatter
uniforms clear a path for two patrol cars
sirens whoop as they coast in tap bumpers blocking the intersection
police officers form a formidable skirmish line
shouting for revelers to move aside
gun in his pocket
elbowing his way through the crowd
he sees the gauntlet of uniforms and patrol cars blocking the intersection ahead
asher shoves his hand in his pocket
grace hits the deck
the uniforms hit the deck
the crowd screams claps and whistles
its not gunfire
fireworks unfold in the night sky like giant flowers of fire
rivers of sparks
grace recovers her feet with palpable relief she thought she was dead for a second
grace looking around for asher
laval reaches her
you see him
pop pop boom
laval gestures for some uniforms to spread out
from an apartment building
grace runs into the building
laval follows her
grace and laval running
more screaming o
they run upstairs
an upset woman is in the hall standing by the just been kicked in door of her apartment
grace and laval charge inside
the sliding glass door to the balcony has been shattered
below and beyond is a long rooftop
madly lit by a swirl of bright lights
a huge outdoor dance floor throbs with energy in a park along the st
asher jump from the far end of the roof
laval will go no further
grace gets a running start jumps from the apartment window tucks and rolls
on her feet again grace sprints along the roof
fireworks boom and pop overhead
grace reaches the edge of the roof
reynaud has caught up with her
asher has vanished into a vast sea of dancers adorned with strobing and glowing jewelry
the beat dominates all sound
grace and reynaud trade looks tenacious street cops at heart they holster their guns and jump into the crowd
a dozen yards away
he stalks a dancing raver who wears a huge bundle of glowing necklaces
asher snatches necklaces
disappears into a wall of she and reynaud scan the moving bodies for asher
grace glimpses the back of ashers head
grace and reynaud tear through the crowd like bulls working together a bonding moment
asher is an arms length ahead of grace
she reaches out her fingers snag the cloth of his shirt
grace shoves him aside and moves on
she sees a disturbance up ahead
grace shoulders her way through the crowd
grace and reynaud converge on the disturbance
they cleave through onlookers to reveal
two drunk college jocks slug it out
grace looks around no asher
angry frustrated grace grabs one of the jocks hurls him to the ground
six uniforms swarm in and arrest the two jocks
reynaud throws up his arms in frustration
he looks at grace they know theyve been beaten
pull back to reveal grace and reynaud surrounded by an ocean of bodies in motion
some dude with his shirt off grinds on three hotties
his face is an evil green from his mane of pilfered gel glow necklaces
red plastic cup in hand asher enjoys the boisterous anonymity
dangerous and cold
they track grace as she moves through the crowd
asher grabs one of the hotties begins making out with her
grace searching the crowd
grace passes within feet of asher
now another hottie wants a kiss
costa has a beer his nose bandaged
inspectors finish up questioning patrons
grace enters crosses to costa
shes tense wound tight
need a ride home
costa looks at her
despite everything his face shows he is glad to see grace
costa in the passenger seat
the night started out great
everyone was happy
you helped land a big fish and the feeding frenzy started
six figure pieces were flying off the wall
shivers he said he was going to blow out my spine
i was thinking surgery
six months in bed
never walking again
grace looks at him
costa is worried
he was in my bathroom and none of you could stop him
i need to leave town
that might be a good idea
until then ill check under your bed for monsters
costa looks at her
grace gives him a warm open stare
i would appreciate that very much
a beat can i profile you
i read your book
thirty something single white female
best schools best grades
discovers adrenaline policing the inner city
cuts in john stop it
lets shift the conversation from me and my business onto something inbounds
are you going to my funeral when martin asher cuts my throat
they both know shes been lowballing the threat
we can tell grace is truly concerned for costas welfare
you let him get away
grace takes that hard
i meant you in the general sense
a beat can you catch him
we got his name
we catch everyone sooner or later
costa and grace enter
costa scoots aside a pile of clothing
cool art sketches images all over the walls
reminiscent of graces hotel room
and a very cool view of downtown
grace taking everything in
art books sketch pads
piled high on the desk
she looks at the ceiling
sees notes and sketches taped up
grace laughs to herself
its a sty
must be a profiling mother lode
im done profiling you
i got you figured out
a failed healer a failed artist
grace looking at a drawing on the wall
costa winces he didnt want her to notice it
is that how you see yourself
i did it last night
this is how you see me
its how i think you see yourself
and how do you see me
costa licks his lips
that would be out of bounds
grace looking at him
costa looking at her
a staring match
costa and grace try not to laugh
they end up giggling
what was that
i dont know
john games are fun
but head games are dangerous
then keep your head out of it
grace shrugs back to business
the justice minister is going to relocate you to another city until mr
asher is in custody
i dont know what your deal is
one second youre so there then all i get is the badge
i apologize if youve been getting the wrong signal
they want you on a flight tomorrow morning
this monster comes into my life and i have to leave
a uniform sergeant enters
my people are in place
thank you sergeant
the sergeant exits
this is surreal
what do i pack
what you need
movers can get the rest
i need tomorrow morning to finish up my business here
ill let them know
this is goodbye
neither of them feels very good about it
i thought you were going to check under my bed
grace smiles plays along crosses looks under the bed stretching for costa
driving him nuts
grace holds out her hand
i probably wont see you again until the trial
if there is a trial
costa leans across her braces himself against the wall
a bold move
now they are eye to eye
grace kisses costa for a long beat
grace breaks the kiss
holds a finger to her lips shhh
she turns and exits
the door shuts behind her
costa is going to miss grace
the next morning
laval pulls up in unmarked next to the patrol car that has been guarding costas apartment
with a wave the uniform behind the wheel drives off
laval exits his car
crosses to costas door
reynaud and grace have just pulled to the curb a half block away
reynaud behind the wheel turns to grace
you spent a lot of time with costa
grace isnt sure if thats an accusation
i like him

laval ringing the bell
a white plumbers van pulls up behind lavals unmarked
a plumber gets out
crosses to another apartment
costa opens the door
with two packed bags
laval takes one
costa takes one last look at his home
locks the door
laval watches the plumber knocking a couple doors down
costa and laval cross to unmarked
the plumber approaches them
costa looking at him the plumber is martin asher
a gun in his hand
laval drops costas bag reaches for his holster
pop pop pop
asher drops laval with three to the face
costa stares in disbelief at the mortally wounded cop
asher shoves costa into the drivers seat of unmarked
reynaud guns it
costa behind the wheel
asher in the passenger seat
you just shot a cop
costa hits the gas and pulls out
reynaud slides to a stop
leaps from the still moving car and checks his friend laval
who is no more
grace wants to get asher
you staying or going
im not leaving
grace slides behind the wheel
and takes off in the muscular cop car
scared to death
asher has the gun in his lap aimed at costas face
asher looks exhausted
asher notes the police radio
jesus he was a cop
hes dead because of you because you made the choice
the choice to fuck with me
that john was a very bad choice
a t intersection ahead
costa makes the turn
it leads to a highway
youre dead john costa

costa is shaking looks in the rearview
asher rips the rearview off the windshield
im flooring it
costa pulls onto the highway buckles his safety belt
asher scoffs at the gesture then does likewise
give me your wallet

asher looks through it pockets it
costa tries to focus on driving
are you going to kill me
youre goddamn right i am
ive been dreaming about it john
grace flooring it
sails onto the highway
costas unmarked races northward out of the city
grace catching up
costa gets stuck behind a slow moving truck
pass the truck john
before i blow your head off
god help me
costa swings out to pass the truck
a head on imminent
the buick swerves onto the shoulder
just missing them
grace watches costas unmarked scrape past the truck
a side mirror is knocked off
the oncoming buick swerves back onto the asphalt
overcompensates now heading right for grace
grace reacts swerves
the cars hit
grace gets a face full of airbag
graces car spins off the road
stops in a ditch
the buicks hulk blocking the road
grace exits the unmarked
dazed but unhurt
she crosses to the buick
three high school girls are in the car
is everyone okay
they seem alright
i think so
omigod i have to call my mom
a police car screeches to a stop
then another police car
grace runs to one of the police cars
points up the road he just shot a cop
grace jumps in the passenger seat
the cop looking at her
bad guys that way
the cop nods punches it
costa is driving towards the mountains
driving through the pine forest
a hard to see side road
costa jams the brakes to make the turn
asher slaps him
you dont want to do this
yes i do
john do you have any idea how many people i have killed
its always been business
this time is personal
please be cool
cmon we dont even know each other

costa speeds up
i got money

i am not martin
there is no martin
what do you want
whats my life worth to you
this is deeper than money

just shut the fuck up
asher lights a cigarette
a sharp turn ahead
costa speeding up
okay please martin
asher aims his pistol at costas head
really pissed who the fuck is martin
costa sets his brow in determination he is driving straight at a large tree
costa jams his thumb into the release button of ashers seatbelt
asher angrily pulls the trigger of his pistol
the unmarked car hits the tree
costas body is slammed by crash forces but stays put
asher goes over his airbag
ashers head goes through the windshield
the cop guns it into the mountains
a fork in the road
which way do i turn
which ways the river
go to the river
the cop makes a right
oil smoke and steam pour from the unmarked
costa is alive cut bad
he looks at asher
rot in hell martin asher
ashers head is stuck through the windshield his throat cut bad by glass
asher panic sucks deep breaths
costa undoes his safety belt
grabs the door handle
the door pops open
costa pulls himself from the wreck
flames spread under the car
they race along a mountain road with a view of the st
lawrence river below
they can see far up the road no sign of the unmarked
grace looks behind them reacts
a column of smoke rises from behind a ridge
subtitled french turn around
costa lays by the road
motionless he may be hurt bad
is now martin ashers funeral pyre
flames engulf everything
even the glass is melting
costa stirs crawls on his hands and knees into the road away from the wreck
pop pop pop
ammunition in the unmarked explodes from the heat
a police car arrives
screeches to a stop alongside costa
grace leaps from the passenger side
she grabs costa helps him into the back
pop pop pop
more ammo cooking lets go
the cop backs up fast
now the tree has caught fire
grace examines costa running her hands over costas battered body
i think my hand is broken
grace looks at it
there is no doubt
dont move okay
presses his split scalp
youre going to the hospital
youll be fine
is he dead
costa relaxes significantly
he realizes grace is holding him in his arms
so does grace
it feels good
a fire engine heading to the crash passes them
crime scene tape
policemen form a perimeter
the fire is out
a fire truck pumps water for a three man hose team cooling the hot metal
a plume of steam rises up the scorched tree trunk
the car is nothing more than blackened sheet metal
asher has been reduced to a charred torso
reynaud sits by himself his head between his knees
mourning laval dead on a nearby gurney
director gillet crosses to him
lays a comforting hand on reynauds shoulder
reynaud sees who it is stands crisply wipes his tears embarrassed
i am sorry sir
i called your wife
im having someone take you home to her
there is nothing left to do here
reynaud doesnt want to leave his dead comrade
im ordering you home
a uniform escorts him out of there
director gillet crosses to grace who was watching him
she sips coffee an icepack on her ankle
youre really good with people
he got off light
with a broken wrist and fifty stitches
my luck has run out
until today i have never had to bury a friend
grace squeezes his arm
im sorry director
thankfully its over
we have our man
ashers dna matched the hairs recovered on fords body and in the apartment
costas scalp is being stitched shut
costas wrist is in a splint
she watches the doctor sew flesh for a beat
grace smiles warmly at costa
winces ouch doc
thats not rawhide
ill inject more anesthetic
grace leans against the wall smiles
thank you for rescuing me
do you know where he was taking you
to my grave
he was going to kill me
a beat let me take you out tonight
lets have some fun
i owe you that
whats fun for you
you want to go to the shooting range or the morgue
grace is hurt by that
its going to take a couple days to depose you and get a full statement
i thought you might enjoy a break before you have to
i know a place
grace and costa chill on throw pillows and tapestries
persian trip hop and hookahs
grace and costa have melted into a corner where they sip tea
nobody has been more comfortable
costa pours beer from a pitcher
im happy to be alive but its like this door has been opened
i dont think i was naive
but everything is different now
youll fold this experience into your life and be stronger for it
how do you deal with it
all the misery and pain and violence
i can stop monsters john
and because i can i have to
so is it a calling or a curse
its just my job
when i was in med school i saw a guy on a harley get t boned by a daihatsu
he was screaming in pain and needed help and i knew what to do i had all my certs but i saw all this blood and froze
i failed the big test
bye bye med school
hello graphic design
the man on the harley
so you knew about that
no wonder you knew what to say to keep me cooperating
youre a sharp one john costa
you threw me in a tiger cage like a piece of meat
you were the cheese in the trap
we stopped a monster
thats what matters
grace is utterly unapologetic
it makes costa like her even more
grace is in manic cleaning mode
she pulls papers off the walls
shoves a pile of clothing in the closet
sweeps coffee cups into a wastebasket
she opens the door for costa
the room is still a mess but it feels safe cozy
im a pig
i dont trust anyone whos too organized
grace puts some music on the clock radio
want a beer
she grabs a couple cold ones from the mini fridge
which is it are you a runner or chaser
whats that mean
people like you people like me
yeah people like you
gung ho people like you
and you know what i mean
people like you are either runners or chasers
grace looks at costa
you are a trip john costa
hes not letting her off the hook
she plays along
i guess im running and chasing
i didnt know
growing up i quit speaking after that
i didnt say a word for three years
when youre not in the conversation you get forgotten real quick
so id watch people
the mouth can say anything but the body doesnt lie
the tilt of the head the way the hands move
grace draws closer
costa watching her mouth
howd you get your voice back
the day my uncle died
the truth exploded out of me like a vision
my uncle and father had been arguing there was a gunshot and my father was dead
you are very intense you know that
i remember my uncle telling me not to say anything
and i didnt
i made myself forget why
the day he died my voice and my memory came back
i screamed for an hour
i havent shut up since
why did your uncle do it
great grandpa owned half of pennsylvania
my uncle wanted control and sold it all
all thats left is an old farmhouse and a horse pasture
sadly my fathers murderer got away with it because i couldnt open my mouth
thats a hell of a lot of responsibility for you to put on the shoulders of an eight year old girl
grace blinks looks at costa
thats exactly what she needed to hear
something good game out of it
the dead cant speak
now im their voice
costa cups her face and kisses her
grace breaks away a little hesitant
something is bothering her
martin asher is dead right
can we please forget about him
thats the point
hes dead so there wont be a trial where you or i would have to admit under oath that we did anything inappropriate
we havent done anything
thats about to change
grace stands pulls him off the couch
begins undressing him
she finds horrible dog bite scars
in college we tried to make my friends german shepherd take a bong hit
serves you right
costa pulls grace to her feet
step by step across the room
the immediacy building
costa grabs her
up against the wall
the phone clatters to the floor
graces eyes widen
costas hand reaches up her skirt
his hand reaching into her panties
graces eyes looking away
as she grabs his arm
their breath mingling
costas lips crush down on hers
the kiss devouring
knocking pictures off the walls
graces hands pulling him closer
costa picks her up
throws her on the bed
he tears at her blouse
her white lace bra
graces back arching
her legs wrapping around him
as her eyes flutter open
looking up at the ceiling she gasps
to see what shes looking at
surprised to see pictures of ashers victims the crime scenes
staring down at them
costa turns to grace whispers
let them watch
grace looking deep into costas eyes
nods her head
costa flips her onto her stomach
grace and costa spoon
kisses the back of costas head
hes utterly still
grace enters groggy
turns on the sink
flips on the light
grace reacts stumbles back
shes covered with blood
grace panics feels herself for wounds
grace shakes costa
tears well in her eyes
he sees the blood
doesnt really react
my stitches must have ripped
grace hands him a towel
presses it against his shoulder
i thought you were scared of blood
you better take a shower
asher looking at martin ashers remains
the charred torso blackened thighbones
asher reaches for ashers red swollen face
please dont touch the remains
she gives him a withering look
nineteen years ago i stood in this same room and your predecessor showed me a washtub full of blood and guts and told me it was my son
i will touch anything i want doctor
im not going through this a third time
he hands her a pair of rubber gloves
asher snaps them on she reaches for an eyelid peels it back
stares into the clouded eye
asher reacts quickly withdraws her hand
its not him
thats not my blood
you people are incredible
the medical examiner sighs thinks shes a kook
ill swab your cheek and test your dna against the body
will that do it
good idea doctor
hes smarter than all of you do you know that
the doctor staples costas scalp
is that going to hold
im not coming back
grace enters in a serious mood
that was my boss
im going back to quantico tomorrow
suddenly that seems like the end of the world
costa looks at her
washington dc has some of the best art in the world
georgetown would be a great place to open a gallery
grace realizes what hes saying
staple his mouth too doc
graces cell rings
she exits to take the call
grace leans against a wall
i ran mrs
ashers dna against the suspect down here
no way its her son
not her son
lab ran the test twice
was he adopted switched at birth
listen for a minute
there was a match
john costa is mrs
ashers biological son
its a joke
so john costa is really martin asher
dear god i wish i was joking
grace turns and reacts
costa has been standing there
he tries to read graces expression worry etching his face
grace is looking at costa her mind racing a million miles an hour
graces world crumbles as she puts it together
are you martin
the very thought is painful
grace im john
costa hoping against hope everything is okay
but its not okay
grace has a calamitous expression
costa takes a step toward her
the street cop motions for costa to stay back
graces purse sits on a chair in the exam room
her pistol visible
costa takes the gun from her purse pockets it along with her fbi credentials and car keys
costa backs away from grace
costas physicality transforms from hip art dealer to something much more menacing
the monster martin asher
grace looks him dead in the eye more angry than scared
note costa will now be called asher
she screwed it up didnt she
i should have cut her throat when i saw her on the ferry
thats the least she deserves
please dont do anything grace
it would hurt me so much if i had to hurt you
dont hurt me
costa shakes his head his brow set with a grim determination
he turns enters a stairwell and exits the building
graces heart is breaking
she kicks the wall and gives chase runs into the stairwell
asher gets into graces unmarked
and drives away
grace exits the building watches him go
grace has no way to follow
she sees a cop talking to a cute nurse by his patrol car
we need to pursue him
hes a murder suspect
the cop cocks his head looks at grace like shes a nutcase
grace dials her cell phone
director gillet theres an emergency can you please tell this officer to cooperate with me
grace hands the cell phone to the cop
a patrol car stops in front
grace leaps out and runs into the building
an unmarked pulls up
reynaud jumps out and enters the building
reading room numbers
reynaud appears in the hall
grace finds the right room
reynaud joins her gun drawn
the door is ajar
grace pushes it open
a maid changes the sheets
asher is gone
asher answers a knock at her door
asher hello mother
asher forces his way inside
sirens screaming flashing lights as six police cars zip by at
grace over the shock and harder than steel
reynaud drives fast
grace on her cell
she turns her phone off
asher sits on her couch
the teeny doberman walks into the room sniffs asher
what happened to rex
he was a real dog right mom
rolls up his sleeve revealing the dog bite scars
dont show me that martin
i had rex put down after you ran away
asher looks at her defiantly
asher stands gets in his face
how dare you defy me
you will sit down on that couch and you will do it now
asher lays a hand on his leans forward her eyes intense and earnest
martin you have severe emotional problems
i know youre in a lot of pain
theres hope and help martin
look at me martin
i love you very much
i know now that what you did to me was not love
asher sitting on the couch
ill stand if i want to stand
i can do anything i want to do
and ive done some great things mother
im not a scared little boy you can push around anymore
ashers head neatly adorns a silver platter
grace holds on as reynaud slaloms around a corner in ashers neighborhood
i hope the son of a bitch doesnt shoot me with the gun you gave him
what else did you give asher
an accusing look
shut up and focus
that kind of shit helps no one right now
reynauds car slides to a stop
police cars take position around the block forming a perimeter around the house
grace and reynaud exit the car
grace has a shotgun
four uniforms also with shotguns join them
the ad hoc entry team runs up the steps onto the porch
get right i got left
reynaud kicks the door
grace is first in
grace reynaud and the four uniforms enter
weapons sweep for targets and clear sectors
grace moving down the hallway
slowly breathing hard
grace enters approaching the couch
someone is there
grace sidesteps quickly raises the shotgun
sans head sitting on the couch
grace turns away reacts
she sees mrs
reynaud looks at grace
grace feels hollow miserable
graces hotel room is now a crime scene
criminologists process the scene
the sheets are bagged as evidence
reynaud crosses to her
my best friend died protecting a serial killer so you could get laid
the cat is out of the bag
thats none of your business
its my case
back off reynaud
asher fooled you too
at least i didnt fuck him
grace walks off
reynaud intercepts her
touch me again and i will kick your ass
i am taking you to the director
gillet sits at her desk across from grace
his eyes are harder than normal
theyre on their way from the airport
grace nods chews a nail
your old life is over
there is no going back
youre still young
whatever happens be strong
beat where is he grace
how do we find him
director im the last person you should be discussing the case with at this point
you know his mind and his heart
where is he
this city no longer has the psychic gravity to hold him here
try mexico getting a facelift
we idd the remains in the morgue
the real id
he hands her a picture of the man whom we thought was asher
reads richard hart
hart rolls painting canvases into a tight cylinder
inserts it into a fancy lamp
a hypodermic stands by to reward his work
he was an addict
and a thief
an art thief
he hits galleries in europe and north america
traveled back and forth smuggling and selling stolen canvasses
grace puts it together
let me guess costa was selling stolen art for hart and never gave him the money
now hart is just another one of ashers victims
costa owed him eight thousand
those are e mails off harts computer
reading go to hell
i wont pay you a dime
im not scared of you
richard hart checks his e mail and nearly has a heart attack
come and get me
i will never pay you dumbass
thinks a beat asher taunted hart into a confrontation
it was right there in my face
i was interpreting behavior from two different suspects
he had us all fooled grace
all of us
if asher can do that what else can he do
anything he wants
gillet stands crosses opens his door
two fbi supervisors enter
grim silver haired
ah the undertakers have arrived for my career
grace hugs gillet
and the fbi men escort her out of gillets office
grace is on the spot
her lawyer by her side
facing a panel of seven senior agents
microphones water pitchers
have your rights been explained to you and has an indication to that effect been made in your employee record
grace is exhausted but holding up well
the questions dont stop
why would asher kill ford if nobody knew he was costa
if he wasnt going to use fords identity
he needed a murder he could link not only richard hart to but also to his past victims
upscale euro hip
hart slams down the phone
shoves a gun in his belt and exits
harts behavior was consistent with a disorganized drug addict following the rules of the criminal road by attempting to kill a debtor who wont pay
he had no idea he was being manipulated by a serial killer
asher enters through the front door
hart isnt home
asher steals floss from the garbage can
takes harts toothbrush
some dirty laundry
asher wasnt becoming disorganized and decomposing into madness he was evolving
asher his face obscured with a sweatshirt hood pulls todd ford from the trunk
the ford murder was staged and i missed it
asher drove fords car there with ford unconscious in the car
ether maybe ghb
something that disappears
asher works out heads to the parking lot
pulls ford out of the trunk
and strangles him
he left a couple of harts hairs on the body
asher leans over todd ford strangling the unconscious man with the garotte
asher places a couple of harts hairs on the body
asher drawing the sketch of who we now know was hart
is that a sly grin asher has
he draws a nice portrait of mr
hart and hes now inside the heart of montreal pds investigation
in the bathroom asher wearing surgical gloves places harts comb in the medicine cabinet
puts harts trash in the wastebasket
evidence at the ford crime scene led to an apartment with more of harts dna
and evidence linking hart to ashers crimes
hart never set food in that apartment
asher staged everything
grace chasing hart
hart not asher murdered the montreal inspector correct
hart thought costa was systematically destroying his life
harts violent explosion was inevitable
how could asher plan on hart snapping like that
my guess is asher intended to kill hart and make it look like suicide
the authorities would find the body and close the martin asher file
things are wrapping up
this ethics panel has no choice but to recommend terminating you for misconduct
do you wish to make a statement
grace shakes her head no
please speak up for the record
grace leans into her mike
i have nothing to say
grace does the walk of shame in front of her former colleagues
she carries a cardboard box full of personal stuff from her office
two gsa police escort her
grace heaves the box into the back of her audi
a gsa police car stands by
dick colton her ex boss intercepts her before she gets in
this is a bitter loss to the unit
want some good news
rcmp closed their investigation and the minister isnt indicting you
this could have been a real train wreck for you grace
grace gets in her car
no one has any clue where asher is
that son of a bitch might fixate on you
please watch your back grace
ill dig a hole and hide in it
dont fade away grace
youre still my friend okay
grace pulls out
heads for the road that will take her out of quantico
grace has the top down
the wind snatching papers from her box
grace doesnt care
grace watches tv in the dark
drinking a beer
her cell rings
grace looks at it
sees out of area on the caller id
im sorry you lost your job
grace grabs the big
by her thigh
i miss you
why dont you come and see me
i miss you too
im at the gainesville virginia
the motel off highway
there is a strange tension in her voice
she hangs up
turns off the tv
she gets off the bed crosses to a corner
she sits settles in for a long vigil
the rising sun reveals grace has not moved
she is now realizing asher isnt going to show
grace drops the
and begins to cry
grace exits the clinic reading a test result
she freezes in her tracks returns inside
she has a quarter ton bag of dog food
gallons of spaghetti sauce
its an ice storm
freezing rain accumulates on existing snow and ice
grace loading her supplies into her truck
its miserable out and getting worse
grace turns to watch a car slowly sliding helpless across the ice
it stops just short of hitting a parked car
ten minutes later grace checks her p
finds some baby catalogs
a local pregnant woman enters
wow you know the question
grace is very pregnant
good luck sweetheart
get yourself home its miserable out
grace smiles exits
old and falling apart
overgrown with branches
the wind picking up
graces truck slowly navigating the ice
the only vehicle around
the accumulating ice is beautiful but deadly
grace drives with extreme caution picking through the ice in low gear
she drives around a fallen tree branch
the state police have said to stay off the road unless its an absolute emergency
several of their cruisers have already been damaged
there is ice everywhere
on the way in tonight i saw the snowplow slipping and sliding
everybody stay where you are
this is only the beginning
grace turns off the radio
turns on the defroster
her windshield shatters
a tree branch overburdened with ice has fallen on her truck
the truck slides across the ice
grace fights to regain control to keep it out of the ditch
pulls the branch off the hood
the last remnant of the once proud vanderholt holdings
grace pulls open a large garage door
assaulted by rain and sleet
she slips on the ice
regains her feet finishes opening the door
she gets back in her truck and parks it inside the garage
filled with family heirlooms
another family that has decayed from glory
she turns off the alarm
then hangs up her heavy jacket
grace crosses to the kitchen
grace takes a glock from her pocket and sets it on the counter
she pours water into a kettle
puts the kettle on the stove
turns on the stove
grace notices water on the kitchen floor
reaches for the glock
a hand lands on top of her hand
its martin asher
he snaps a handcuff around graces wrist
asher has the upper hand he spins her pulls her down into a chair
she throws a punch
asher blocks it
asher yanks on her cuffed arm
grace slaps him
asher pulls her into a chair
grace is now cuffed to the chair
she struggles futilely against the cuffs
asher catches his breath
knock it off
youre not going anywhere
grace stop struggling
asher looking at her huge belly
im not going to hurt you
youre so full of shit your eyes turned brown
asher is happy to see her
grace looking at him
still astonished to see him
her arms behind her back her belly is so vulnerable
how the fuck did you find me
you told me everything i had to know
get it over with
just get it over with
ever since i met you youre all i can think about
i had a way of life
and i cant go back to because of you
i want you in my life grace
please listen to me grace
i have a proposal
asher takes out a couple passports a pair of drivers licenses
you become her
i become him
we are married see
asher slides a womans wedding ring across the table
we have the babies
we raise them
however you want
i just want to be with you
grace looking at asher not sure whether to laugh out loud or start crying
he seems edgy he needs her decision quick
what happens if i dont want to assume this womans identity and raise my babies with a serial killer
grace dont be morbid
if anyone can deal with this you can
i know you felt what i felt
answer my question
ill shoot you in the head and burn this place down
she can respect that
grace looking at asher
hes scary feeding off some fantasy about her
youll do what you have to do
i can respect that
how do you know its still real
maybe its gone
what we felt
grace tilts her lips looking in his eyes
asher leans over to kiss her
asher kneels beside her the kisses become hungry desperate
graces eyes are so open so vulnerable
god i missed you so much
asher leans in to kiss her
grace head butts him
smashes his nose
she drives her feet down and her shoulder into his chest
asher already on his knees falls back
grace scrambles over him gets out of the chair
she shoulders over the kitchen table
there is a holster mounted underneath the table
grace turns her back so she can grab the gun from it
there is no gun in the holster
asher looking at her matter of fact i searched everything
asher stands reaches for the glock on the counter
grace cant let him get it
she lunges at asher collides into his knees hurting him
asher grabs a large knife from the butchers block
plunges it into graces belly
grace gasps looking at the knife embedded in her stomach
a beat as grace and asher stare at the knife
grace uses the pause to kick away from asher
she gets on her feet and runs from the kitchen
grace exits the kitchen door running with her hands cuffed behind her
running for her life
she runs for the nearby woods
her shoes crunching through a layer of fresh ice over old snow
fighting for balance
pop pop pop
asher opens fire on her from the house
bullets hit the ice around her
grace runs into the woods
branches sheathed in ice
smacking her face
asher exits the house firing pop pop pop pop
bullets explode the ice around grace
she dives to the ground
she takes the opportunity to move her handcuffs from behind to in front
she unties and removes the heavy prosthetic belly she wears
grace is not pregnant
she pulls the knife out
grace runs deeper into the woods
asher running in the woods behind her
the gun in his hand at the ready
asher is hunting
he intends to kill her
keep fucking running grace youre only going to die tired
batting away ice covered branches
drenched with sleet
grace emerges from the woods
running along the icy road
she slips and falls
cuts her hand on the ice
grace stands and keeps running her hand bleeding the knife getting slippery
gaining on her
grace slips again scrabbling on the ice trying to keep moving
a slow motion nightmare
here comes asher
he aims the gun at her face
grace raises her hands to protect her face
the bullet intended for graces forehead hits the knife ricochets into the trees
grace looking at the now creased knife
ashers gun is out of rounds
the slide is locked back on an empty chamber
grace slices ashers legs with the knife
slices each shin deeply
asher kicks the knife from her hand
then kicks her in the face
he tries to kick her again but she grabs his leg
asher slips hits the ice hard
grace is on top of him wraps the handcuffs around his neck
wraps her legs around his body
grace chokes asher for all hes worth
his eyes bulge his face reddens as he meets the same fate as his victims
asher has a seizure as his oxygen depleted brain dies
grace doesnt let go
a long death embrace
finally when she is sure grace releases from martin ashers body
she checks his pulse
the rain falling on her
ice and moonlight
grace spits blood looks around
looks at ashers corpse
better you than me asshole
walks back toward the house
