screenplay by ehren kruger lies face down in a nighttime expanse of snow
one of the bodys red sleeved arms is twisted at a sickening angle
the white snow beneath the figure is spreading with red
the figure in the suit lies motionless
dark rustic wood an office with broken windows and whistling winter beyond
a second body in a santa claus suit lies dead in the doorway
its a man with a large build
the suit is riddled with holes
his face is missing
more snow falling
a handful of cars in the lot
a third body in the same red and white outfit lies atop the hood of an old pontiac
his head is not visible having smashed through the windshield
his suit is charred and blackened
a halo of broken glass outlines him
his black boots hang off the front bumper
the parking lot is silent
a floor scattered with shiny silver quarters
reflections of neon
theres a fourth santa here face down in a red pool
the suit is far too big for him
not that it matters now
where the fifth and final santa lies at the edge of a ravine which plummets a hundred feet down
the man rests precariously atop the slope upside down eyes closed
his burned suit is smoldering
he has a sly but tired face late s sandy hair cold and scarred
this is rudy duncan
he opens his eyes
i never was much for the holidays
rises as a title appears seven days before
and then to complete the sentence
snow drifts down onto the stone walls and wire fences of the iron mountain michigan s
winters been here awhile
rudy duncan lies in his top bunk staring at his ceiling where a handful of paper cut snowflakes have been pasted
the sounds of yelling inmates and gates slamming shut echo through the fortress
rudy watches a spider scurry across the paper snow
its his excitement for the day
he turns to the wall where theres a photo of his teenage self with some co workers at an auto body shop
and a family photo cheery midwesterners with rudy a scowling artful dodger
shows the dates have been crossed off up to december th
december nd is circled again and again
rudy muses at the calendar then hops out of his bunk
drops to the floor crosses to a desk finds a chewed on pen
turning back to the beds we reveal where rudys cellmate nick mason rugged mustached and well built sleeps soundly
in contrast his bed wall is a collage of photographs twenty maybe thirty of them
almost a mural
all of them photos of a beautiful young girl mid twenties smiling out from beaches parties and snowy scenes
gorgeous brown hair heartbreaking smile
stares at the pictures for a moment wistful
nick snores turns over
rudy climbs atop his bunk again with the pen this time
and crosses december th off the calendar
the two of them nick and rudy shivering by the fence
nick absently whistles some silver bells then digs for a smoke
whats the first thing man
whats the first thing youre gonna do
havent thought about it
hell you havent
get to thinking about it it wont happen
we walk outta here we hit that road whats the first thing youre gonna do
aint there yet
three days man
fuckin christmas man
fuckin christmas on the outs
dozens of uniformed inmates wander the yard stamping feet hands tucked away breath frosting
nick tries to light his cig but the wind plays havoc
nick curses tosses it
get a hot mug of chocolate
nods first thing im gonna do
smiles and a slice of pecan pie right
and some pecan pie
nick laughs stares through the fence at the gates of the prisons entrance road
shes gonna be out there man
right there waiting
gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms
got us a motel out highway bringing her own damn sheets you read that part
silk damn sheets
lock ourselves in the whole week drinking wine taking baths man see if they got those room service steaks
anything i want to do
remember when she wrote that
anything i want
they stand there shivering
its freezing but the time they get outside is too precious to give up
all those pictures shes sent
you sure theyre all of her nick
you hear sometimes they dont send their real pictures
could be her cousin or something
nick studies him
why you gotta say a thing like that
im just saying
why you gotta
we were gonna give you a ride someplace man
now i just dont know
im just talking

they trail off in silence
nick looks out at the prison road again
a snowy wasteland
im gonna marry this girl
rudy lies in his bunk staring at the same paper snowflakes
hey hey listen here
ive made my list and ive checked it twice and as long as youre naughty its gonna be nice
these cold winter weeks have been killing me nick as i lie here alone
its not enough to have your warmth in my heart anymore i need your warmth next to me
work at penneys has been busy because its christmas and thats when we do almost half of our business for the whole year okay whatever whatever skipping on my managers
still mad at me for asking for the whole week off whatever whatever smiles here we go
and all that gets me through the day is to close my eyes and imagine holding you and kissing you and touching you and tasting you everywhere because i know
at that moment ill feel ive found the reason for my whole entire life
rudy still stares at the stone ceiling
for twenty five she sounds pretty mature
you grow up in detroit you get matured real quick
nicks doing pushups on the floor below smoking a cig reading sheets of pink stationery
with a new photo of the same girl in a bikini by a lake
vamping a childish pose
sure as hell dont make me miss millie bobek
guess i owe millie though
if i hadnt been rollin her i woulda never ended up here
and i woulda never met ashley
studies photo thats the world for ya
nick climbs off the floor paces back to the bunks marvelling at the latest letter
what if she sees you man sees what you look like
and its not there
you just dont do it for her
me and her got a connection
hands page to him read this part
read the part about stuffing her stocking
nick drops the page on his stomach
rudy sighs picks it up brings it to his nose
shes using a new perfume
no i think thats just oranges
she writes here shes eating oranges
shoulda written to that magazine rudy
im gonna walk outta here walk right into a relationship
not some one nighter man
youre gonna walk outta here with bus fare
searching for the drunkest skirt in the room
more egg nog
shoulda written rudy
nick drops back to his bunk pasting the new lakeside photo among his collage of pictures
admiring his pen pal shoulda got yourself a girl
above rudy peruses the page nick gave him
some lipstick marks pressed to the paper
he passes it back closes his eyes
all i want
is to make it to sidnaw and sit down for christmas dinner
watch some ball with my old man sleep in my old bed and have leftovers for bout six months
thought you hated sidnaw
just taste that christmas turkey
thought you hate your old man
five years nicky
shrugs i just want to go home
theres the echo of crashing metal gates
nick smiles still staring at his girl
me and ashley
well be thinking about you
guards monitor prisoners as they file out of their cells for the afternoon meal
rudy and nick are motioned out by a mean guard his bitter world etched in his face
they join the line
across broadway a parallel line is forming
a tall tattooed native american the alamo steps out of his cell
his hands are the size of a mans skull
dont look like he missed the sunlight
pinscher told me alamo thinks im the one ratted on him beating up cree
since i was there i saw it he thinks i got him sent to solitary
at that moment alamo glances over
finds rudys eyes
rudy swiftly looks away count me outta mealtime he slaps nick an the back heads back for their cell im not hungry im gonna the mean guard pulls his blackjack
another guards ready behind him
they want rudy to give them trouble
slides back into the line of prisoners
looks across broadway
the alamos walked on up ahead
rudy swallows heads toward the mess hall
a gloopy spoon of chunky red and green jello gets splooshed on rudys plate
same with nick
its the cafeteria line
what the fuck is this
whats this shit in it
swallow and see
the ugly staffer grins from under his plastic hairnet
nick looks to rudy then turns back to the help just so you know this man and i are outta here in two days
so while were inhaling london broil and lobster bisque youre gonna still be standing here smelling up the mystery creamfuck
nods whos in prison now
the ugly staffer curls his lip
rudy moves on taking his tray off the rail and turning right into the chest of the alamo
he looks up into the most scarred and vengeful face a man could ever dread to see
the alamos a lifer
many times over
when you dont expect it
it wasnt me alamo thats when
the alamo strides into the cafeteria line
rudy finally takes a breath as if hes dodged death
nicks at his shoulder
they share a grave and worried look
trying to help two days
rudy and nick sit at a cafeteria table
beside rudy is a frail nervous fiftyish inmate zook
zook sits alone talks to no one always has the shakes
so maybe after our week beneath the sheets well head down to motor city for new years
she says her roommates skipping town for a few days have the place to ourselves
remember how her brothers a truck driver down there
im thinking he might be able to help get me some work
what working security
no im through with that shit
gotta start doing something i got a stake in
get a business going
i dont know ive seen the business world
hotwiring cars rudy does not qualify as a small business
chop shop consultant doesnt work on a resume
he checks across the room on the whereabouts of the alamo
the big indian has his back turned
ashleys talking about maybe we can start something up together
next to rudy zook has stopped eating
he is still as stone staring at his tray
whatsa matter zook
they both watch zook put down his utensils and reach into his red and green jello with his bare hand
the hell you doing zookerman
gloppy gelatin drips from his hand as the frail man lifts a large black cockroach out
just a roach zook
good for you
monsters in the gelatin
its a roach guy there are monsters
voice rising in the gelatin
oh man zook stands up holding jello aloft shakes his head fuckin zookerman a grumbling murmur sweeps through the cafeteria as inmates sift through their jello searching for sonofabitch
he pulls something bug like out of his dessert holds it aloft and then hurls it at the cafeteria line
a staffer ducks away
the inmates laugh and suddenly theyre all on their feet grabbing handfuls of jello and throwing it at the cafeteria line
inmates get errantly splashed and respond by wheeling on their fellow inmates red and green globs flying to and fro
as guards immediately rush in to restore order rudy dont move two days we got two days
dont do nothing
dont touch nothing an inmate at the end of their table picks up their table and overturns it sending food flying
rudy and nick stand back hands raised in surrender
jello hits rudy in the face
dont move rudy
standing right here man
zook is still shouting until a guard clubs him senseless with a blackjack
whistles are blowing
guards scream for order
as a guard eyes them ate the jello jello was fine
the guard leaves them alone runs on
the melees still out of control
as rudy turns and suddenly sees the alamo charging across the room with murderous eyes a metal shank in his hand
five feet away
nick grabs him trying to push him out of the way and the alamos shank plunges deep into nicks stomach burying between his ribs
the alamo pulls the blade out with a ferocious yell pushes nick to the floor and spins on rudy
rudy blocks with a chair stumbling back cartwheeling over a table as the alamo roars over him for the kill and two guards tackle the big indian out of nowhere
knocking the knife away hammering him with blackjacks
it takes another three guards to keep the alamo down
rudy scrambles across the floor
nicks on his back blood pumping freely from his gut in shock alamo
no ones helping the guards nearby all subduing the alamo
nick grabs rudys shirt gasping to speak jesus rudy take it man
youre all right
hold it in
oh fuck rudy
no no no
choking tell her
ill be there
youre gonna be there
were getting outta here
be with her
blood spills out nicks mouth
his eyes go vacant
and rudys suddenly hauled backwards
a trio of guards descend grabbing nicks body as his life fades away
dragging his figure out of the melee
whistles are blowing
rudy struggles enraged and gets blackjacked across the skull for his trouble
he hits the jello covered floor
and the world goes dark
darkness and shadows
rudy sits in a corner holding his head
the cell block silent for the first time
bootsteps from down the row
a shadow falls across rudys somber figure
its the mean guard
he stares at rudy with distinct pleasure
the man had two days
least he wont be coming back
the guard grins a gold tooth
rudy looks at him and then springs to his feet charges the room grabbing through the bars
the guard takes a calm step back
keeps the cruel smile
you need company tonight rudy
you just give a holler
he puckers a kiss and walks on
starts whistling are you lonesome tonight
several shadowed voices request that he shut the fuck up
the bootsteps and melody drift down the row
turns back starts toward his bunk
his eyes on nicks empty bed
and the wall behind
smiling laughing playing kissy face
hearts drawn on the photos
all colors of stationery taped to the wall
takes a seat on nicks bed
theres a shoebox at the foot of it
rudy opens it
its filled with ashleys letters
he trails a finger along them must be over a hundred pages
he selects the one nearest the front
rudy man here we go here what she wrote here the cars waiting
the motels waiting
and im waiting
ive waited for so long
im burning for you nick
my whole body
my whole heart
im burning for you
rudy turns to the wall
to the lakeside picture of ashley a swimsuit siren
rudy stares sadly
he was burning for you too
and puts the letter away
as his hand slashes through december st
near blizzard conditions
a heavy steel door bangs open held by an exit guard
and fifteen convicts make that ex convicts trudge onto a fenced drive covered in snow
your world and welcome to it dumbfucks
dont be a stranger now
well keep the lights on for ya
rudy stumbles out with the group shivering in a goodwill hand me down coat
thin canvas wouldnt keep him warm in summer
he clutches his sides with his hands hunched over
all fifteen huddle and herd toward the gate at the end of the fenceway
there are a dozen friends and relatives waiting
a few men several women a couple kids
bundled in winter coats hats and hoods
a prison shuttle bus is parked behind them
the released cons reach the gate where a gate guard unlocks the fence to the outside world
fifteen men are free
the ex cons and relatives scan each others faces
wives rush over to embrace their men
pals nod to ex cons and trade slaps on backs
the snow batters them wind whipping
rudy keeps his head down leaning forward keeps walking
toward the bus
but he cant help himself he glances up bundled in a silver ski jacket pink wool hat with a poofball on top scarf and mittens
scanning the released prisoners
drops his head looks away
climbs onto the shuttle bus
rudy shakes his arms basking in the vehicles warmth
takes a seat at the back
a couple other lone ex cons climb aboard
then the cons with relatives start to pile in
rudys window is steamed against the cold
he stares into his lap then reaches for his coat pocket
takes out the picture of ashley in her bikini by the lake
stares at it
he rubs his window with his sleeve
outside the woman in the silver coat turns this way and that troubled
shes watching the other ex cons climbing onto the bus with their loved ones
the woman looks back to the prison
the guard closing the gate
the steel door has been shut
no one else is coming
rudy watches her sadly
aboard the bus the seats fill up
ex cons are feeling up their wives kids are climbing on their absent daddies buddies are jawing loudly bout how the neighborhoods changed
the woman outside is now alone
silver coat pink poofball
rudy looks at the bikini picture again
then at the shivering bundle
dont do it rudy
the bus engine starts up
in the seat beside rudy an ex con makes out with his wife while his bratty kid punches his leg
out the window the young woman is scanning the bus windows
then the prison again
she turns in a worried circle
rudy looks swiftly away
closes his eyes
dont do it
the bus door closes
it revs and starts forward
rudy sighs with relief
the photo of ashley falls to the floor
the young woman watches the bus pull away down the snowy road
but it doesnt get fifty feet before it suddenly stops
the door opens
and rudy steps out
the bus revs up again and groans off into the winter
the young woman pushes her poofball hat out of her eyes
we get a look at her face for the first time
skin pale lips turning blue but its the girl from the pictures
she watches rudys figure trudge back toward her
snow obscuring him until hes right in front of her
both of them shivering
both of them standing there
and finally you ashley
and rudy sadly smiles
rudy and ashley sit at a coffee shop booth
coats still on
big rigs bluster by on the highway outside
two untouched cups of coffee sit before them
shes watching him in silence
i like your coat
ashley says nothing
rudy looks at his own this this is just something they gave me at the door
wasnt snowing when we signed up yknow
hows your coffee
ashley looks at it like shes just realizing its there
she lifts the cup takes a sip
puts it down
gotta be ten degrees out there
radio said negative five
i dont think its negative five
thats probably what they meant
rudy bites his lip
i was scared
scared you were gonna take one look at me and change your mind
scared i was walking into heartache
all those words
you put a picture in your mind of where they come from and when you see where maybe its not the same as your picture
he trails off
i figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way no no saw my outfit or something my coat no hey i like your coat
saw me ashley no
that was me thats what i was scared of
i mean be serious
i aint exactly looking like mr
you are to me
rudy goes silent
thought you wrote you had a mustache
i can get another one going
yknow hey whatever you want me to no no no
be like you want to be
another awkward pause
rudy picks up a milk dispenser beside the coffee puts it to his lips
it gives him a wide white mustache
he stares straight faced
ashley gives a bashful smile covers it
do that again
ashley smiles again blushing now
no one more
trying not to no cmon ive been dreaming about that smile ashley mercer
for a long time
they stare across the table drifting into one anothers eyes
youre better than the picture in my mind nick
softly youre real
outside another truck rumbles by whipping up snow
and rudy and ashley slam inside kissing passionately limbs intertwined pawing at each others coats
rudy kicks the door closed
mouths devouring hands lost in snowy hair
they collide with a side table knocking over a lamp tumbling onto the lumpy bed
rudy tears at her silver coat and sweater and turtleneck and capilene and whatever elses she got on as ashleys lips explore his neck and body
writhing and wrestling and rolling off the bed
rudy and ashley fuck like lovers in r rated movies
the bed sheets lie tangled on the floor
rudy and ashley rest naked amidst them
her pretty young head on his chest all their inhibitions gone
rudy strokes her arms
tell me something

go to hell nick mason whats that supposed to mean no not that no
laughs kisses her i mean this the whole thing

ashley studies his face smiles in reflection

they just want to qet inside
when they do they think that means they know who i am

she turns over playfully eases herself back atop him
ready to make up for lost time
with a kiss and hed be here right now
ashley runs through an xmas decorated megamall dragging rudy behind her
both of them laughing as she hauls him over to some cookie bakery company where the hell are you going
we are not leaving that motel room again till after new years we need ten days worth of provisions
to cookie matron whats good

ashleys tearing through mens clothing racks all love and confidence
rudys got a bunch of purchase bags weighing him down you need a coat
ash youve gotten me enough no boyfriend of mine is going to walk around in negative five degree wind chill without a goddamn good looking coat
she pulls out a hellacious black leather fringe number

she puts the jacket against his chest smiling
its two hundred dollars ash she whips a penneys card from her purse grins wickedly you forget where i work

ho ho ho
she runs off with the jacket
rudy turns to a dressing mirror left to stare at his reflection
an ex con in rags with a half dozen holiday shopping bags
to himself just for the holidays nick
then well tell her
well let her
have her holidays
rudy nods till he convinces himself
cant help but smile
puzzles barbies and dinosaurs
kids scurrying parents chasing
rudy and ashley with a scared teen clerk you cant find
toys for adults
where are your toys for adults
how old are you sixteen
we sell childrens toys slams money down i got fifty dollars to spend in your store jesus of nazareth
can you help me or not
the clerk glances around then low slinkys in aisle five twisters in aisle one moon muds in aisle four
as bottles of wine vodka and rum cartons of egg nog and orange juice and countless prepackaged sandwiches come scrolling past
you know what i was thinking after our holiday hideaway
instead of going back to detroit maybe we could go gambling
drive up to that indian place you worked at
wouldnt that be fun
i havent gone gambling in forever
light snow falls
rudy in his new black fringe eyesore and ashley carry grocery bags across the icy asphalt well i dont know about that blackjack nick blackjack i am good at

he kisses her
she nods dismisses it kisses back
well they dont know what the hell theyre missing
ashleys chevy nova pulls back into the lot of the roadside joint
theres an artificial silver christmas tree tied to the roof
she and rudy climb out she heads for the office baby im gonna go tell em not to disturb us for the rest of the year
i get back in that room you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane
ill see what i can do

she smiles sashays sexily away
rudy watches her go admiring his good fortune
then pops the trunk collects some of their shopping score
gifts and goodies
sings sotto i have no gifts to bring parum pum pum pum
no treasures for the king pa rum pum pum pum
loaded down he struggles to the motel room balances bags on his knee gets the key in the door and heads inside
rudy fumbles his way in but i got a girl to be with rum pum pum pum
rudy drops the shopping bags whirls around as a stocky black shadow merlin all pounds of him kicks the door shut what the fuck and swings a baseball bat toward
rudy gets an arm down to deflect the blow but it still stings like a mother
merlin comes at him again and this time rudy slips by
merlins bat shatters a dresser
rudy grabs him by the neck kicks out his knees and wrests him to the ground
grabs the bat and gets decked from behind by another shadow pug a little white guy with a snarl
they go crashing onto the bed grappling for leverage and then to the floor where rudy grabs a champagne bottle from the groceries and bashes it backwards shattering it over
pug lets go as rudy scrambles up and merlins got him again in a bear hug
rudys struggling whirling with him crashing into one wall then another yelling for help until he hears the pump load snap of a shotgun
rudy stops still
a lamp clicks on
standing in silhouette a figure in a leather duster holds a sawed off on him
welcome home nick
another lamp comes on
rudy still in merlins choke hold gets a look at the gunman gabriel
weathered face stringy hair early s
handsome in a scuzzy way
hes seen a lot of road
rudy stares totally thrown
pug the little guy bad teeth bad hair bad skin gets up spitting blood and champagne
i owe ya a drink ya fuck and slugs rudy in the gut
merlin yanks him back up
merlins a black widebody wears a goatee and brass knuckles
behind merlin stands a fourth intruder a stone faced indian in a grateful dead longsleeve
guarding the door
gabriels studying rudy up and down
merlin relaxes his choke hold so rudy can breathe
you dont know me oh i know you nick
i know you real well
no you cant the hell i cant
as the rooms door gets kicked open watch out baby
im bringing in the fucking tree
and the silver fake evergreen fills the doorway getting forced through with ashleys grunts and groans merlin traps his jaw shut
the tree comes squeezing through followed by ashley face in branches im telling you we got the best one in the store
i dont know why people want their houses smelling like the stupid woods
shes grabbed from behind by jumpy
ashley screams but he slams her against the wall
the tree hits the ground
rudy fights to help her but merlins got him
pug locks ashleys arms
she fights muffled cries but jumpy and pug have her held firmly
her face to the wall re the silver tree hope her taste in mens better than her taste in christmas
ashleys turned to face him
her eyes widen
rudys jaw drops
he looks to ashley
then to gabriel
ashley yells enraged kicking and clawing
jumpy slams her back against the wall for her trouble jumpy dont hurt her now
gabriel steps to rudy

ashley stares back confused searching his eyes

gabriel ratchets him across the chin with the gun butt

gabriel puts the gun to rudys head

gabriel kicks rudy in the jaw
gabriel motions to his boys jumpy and pug drag her outside
gabriel kicks rudy again
rudy lies there and takes it
merlin lights a cig examines rudy and ashleys grocery bags hey

merlin nods tucks the bags under his arms leaves the room
gabriel drops beside rudy with a sick smile ive read your letters motherfucker
dont play no reindeer games with me
as we swoop down onto a four lane stretch of winter highway arcing into the blackness
closing on an wheel tractor trailer rumbling onward emblazoned with great lakes trucking
theres an airbrush painting on the door to the cab of a skeleton looking thru a flaming radial tire and the legend motor city monster
gabriel at the wheel merlin smoking jumpy eating cookies
a truck passes gabriel waves
a moment later the cb crackles hey there monster

eyes closed dried blood head rocking side to side
he winces waking with the headache to end all headaches

her hand strokes his face
rudys eyes struggle open
theyre in the back of the truck
theres some packing mats rope two tall storage lockers and ashleys chevy nova
rudys head is in her lap
he struggles to sit up finds his wrists tied with cord
he looks at ashley follows her gaze
in a corner pug sits guard in a beanbag chair
hes dipping chewing tobacco reading road track headphones on
gives rudy a bored glance then back to his magazine
i wont let em nick

rudy looks around remembering
the truck driver
hes not a bad person nick
from the corner pug spits some chaw

if you say that if you keep saying that they will kill you
if they think youre not you they will kill you
dont you see
i know what youre doing but it wont work
nick died for me
i wont let him hurt you
he just wants what you know
ruefully maybe i die for nick
just tell him what you know nick
thats all they want
and well get out of this
rudy gives her a stone cold stare
ashley crumbles touching his face shaking her head tears
he found them
i swear nick
helpless he found them
the truck shudders through downshifts to a groaning stop
ashley embraces rudy fiercely holding on for the last
the trailer gate rattles open into the trucks roof
ashley shuts her eyes
the rig all alone at a snowy rest area
gabriel merlin and jumpy climb inside as silhouette sentries
gabriel surveys then lifts a piece of paper my sweet sexy ashy lashy i have been dreaming of you constantly and knowing you are out there makes these walls not
seem so close or so strong or so cold
to merlin jumpy women live for this stuff
reads on dreaming bout your this dreaming bout your those gettin x rated on me here nicky
where are we
oh right other side
turns paper over someday im gonna take you up by lake s
before i went in before goddamn millie fore i had my situation i used to work up at this casino working security
used to watch for people stealing chips counting cards getting piss drunk that kinda shit
indian place they hired this reject outta vegas to run it got about as much business sense as a buffalo patty
anyways its a fun place to run some numbers and play
gabriel puts the letter down
youre a good writer nick
i give this writing an a plus
i never worked at no casino
rudy steps out of her hold and stalks forward thats the guy i was in with i did my last ten months with him
he rode a two year bit for manslaughter split a guys skull open at a bar for harassing his girl
thats nick mason
he worked at that casino
hes the one who wrote her letters
me im a damn mechanic my last job was a quickie lube i did five for lifting cars
i dont know shit about blackjack i dont know shit about indians
im not him
gabriel stares at him
then crumples the letter
bury this guy
merlin and jumpy grab rudy and throw him from the truck
he hits the snowy parking lot on his side hands bound
gabriel you promised
i promised that when he helped us wed be gone
when he helped us
loverboy dont want to play
merlin and jumpy drop to the snow picking rudy up
you promised me
and you promised me youd get your sweetheart to help
rudy meets eyes with ashley
hed rather die than be with you hed make a fucked up boyfriend anyway
to merlin jumpy bury him all over the place
she charges at her brother
gabriel grabs her spins her into control and punches her in the jaw
she goes flying out of the truck
hits the ground hard
merlin and jumpy march rudy across the lot
a stand of dark and snowy woods ahead
beats prison i guess
rudy struggles desperate but held firm
jumpy loads a handgun as he muses for the very first time the problem with prison
is that it is founded on the fundamentally flawed perception of rehabilitation through punishment
a society cant hope to create a changed man by surrounding him with the worst in his fellow man what it rehabilitates is solely a conviction that if he can
survive the inhumanity of prison what then can he not withstand
he has seen mans darkest soul and kept his sight what is left for such a man
at the woods edge jumpy gives the gun to merlin dont get no blood on my boots the gun goes to rudys head
a bullet fills the chamber
rudy shuts his eyes tight and merlin and jumpy stop
ashley stops screaming
about the tomahawk
what the hell do you want to know
his guards look to gabriel
rudy nods sweating
i spend six months writing poetry and my goddamn pen pal fucks me over
thanks for the stamps ash
you want me you got me
whaddya want to know
ashley gasps relief
merlin and jumpy march rudy back
still on the ground i love you
nick i love you
rudy wont meet her eyes
she says she loves you nick
she says a lot of things
shes getting you to help us
cause she knows if you dont youre dead
you just tell us what we need to know you two live happily ever after
my sister loves you motherfucker and i aint gonna have you break her heart
wish i had a brother like you
a girl says she loves you you say something
rudy looks at ashley
her eyes plead forgiveness
i had better sex in prison
be nice convict
were gonna be working together here
to his boys get him back in the rig
merlin and jumpy wrench rudy backward
ashley reaches out to him starts to speak
he looks right through her
she goes silent casts her eyes to the snow
hes not the guy monster
everyone looks to the truck
weasel faced pug has sidled next to gabriel
spits some chaw
it hits merlins boots
whole time you were driving he was telling her hes not the guy hes not the guy
i know why hed tell us hes not the guy
whys he telling her hes not the guy
what if hes not the guy
gabriel considers jumps off the truck
walks to rudy the man who wrote those letters loved ashley boys
he lived for her love
nods lets see him live for love
gabriel puts a gun under rudys chin
wheres she work
forces gun harder wrote you a hundred letters didnt she
wheres she work
beauty and fragrances
whats her middle name
thinking hard samantha
whatd they call her in high school
whatd they call her in college
whered she drop her cherry
be more specific
a station wagon in canada
whats her greatest fear
its her brother
rudy stares him down
he puts the gun away
ashley regains her breath
lets get back on the road
its time to start talking nick
time to start telling tales nick dont talk till nick gets something
gabriel gives a challenging stare
rudy stares right back
its a showdown
the trucker slowly smiles
his crew chuckles
you want that for here or to go
i been in iron mountain for two years truck driver
i do one more crime im back there for good so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends
you want to hear about some goddamn job of mine
i want some hot goddamn chocolate
theyve stopped laughing
and some pecan fucking pie
the six of them sit in a booth ashley leaning on rudys shoulder apologetically
the four truckers watch him scarf his pie
white christmas plays over the speakers
so when you worked there rudy raises a finger sharply
he continues eating
scrapes the last of his pie crumbs
you knew the place hey
rudy stares hard
gobbles the crumbs washes it down with his hot chocolate
sets the mug down
yknow i could really go for some onion rings
gabriel nods to jumpy who snaps his arm up smashing his knuckles into rudys face
you said talk to him
thats all you ever said
were talking arent we
rudy holds his nose
how much moneys in that casino
day to day
i dont know
the hell you dont
sighs a guess five million
you wrote ash that letter you told her that story bout working christmas eve bout how theyd send half the security guys home nobody comin in that night
and the rest of you got shit faced drinking hot buttered rum
that a true story now
you know where the guards are
you know how to get in and out
you know where the money is
nods were taking down that casino convict
youre the guy gonna tell us how
rudy turns slightly pale
been two years we got faith in you nick mason
smiles youre our inside man
rudy slams in letting the door smack shut behind him
its a tiny windowless closet
rudy kicks a stall door pacing
goddamn it rudy
goddamn girl goddamn nick
youre so smart so fucking smart
he stalks a circle grabs a sink and stares at his reflection in the mirror
he looks a wreck
he settles down
wheres your christmas dinner now
a couple leaves the booth behind gabriels crew
pug and merlin reach over steal their leftovers and dig in
jumpy regards the garlands painted on the windows beside ive read where the retail industry does fifty percent of its business between december st and december th
half the years business in one months time
it seems to me an intelligent society would legislate a second such gift giving holiday create say a christmas two late may early june to further stimulate growth and prosperity
for who would protest such a holiday
taking the fifty percent model a christmas two would grow this countrys annual per capita income by close to one third
everyone stares at jumpy
the indian nods
gabriel shakes his head
ever since you started night school you been givin me headaches jumpy
to merlin pug go see whats taking him
rudy crouches behind the door a piece of iron pipe in his grip ready to strike
as the door slams open swinging fast and bashing him in the head
rudy tags the floor drops the pipe knocked out
merlin and pug gaze down on him shaking their heads
pug spits tobacco
hits merlins boots again
rudys back with a new facial bruise
ashley reaches for his hand he pulls it away
gabriel unfolds a piece of paper its a crude map
here ya go convict
we cased the place in the fall got the layout down
what youre gonna do is show us where each of these doors go what the upstairs level looks like where they got the alarms all of it
and where they hide the real money
merlin exhales some smoke in pugs face
pug hacks shoves him
if you even think about setting us up giving us some bad information
we go down
you go down
lets it settle now
how many guards are there gonna be
rudy surveys the table
all five waiting for him
and which of these doors here lead up to the security level
gabriel passes the map across the table
rudy stares at it
start talking nick
rudys still staring
start talkin who the hell made this map
i said who the hell made the map
this isnt the tomahawk
what the fuck are you talking about
this is the front entrance right
you get through the slots you hit craps here not blackjack
blackjacks here to here lined up
whats this the cage
cage is over there hard to get to you got it all mixed around thats what it looks like
what the hell is this room
whaddya think it is
buffet is by the goddamn bar
what the hell kind of map is this
gabriel reaches across the booth grabs rudys shirt pulls his face to table level we walked the place for a week
and i worked there
for a year
neither man blinks
map is kinda dirty monster
they changed the layout
rudy nods pretending to be dawned upon
they changed the layout whadda they call you
they remodeled the place
when i worked there listen to me guy that managed the joint guy who ran it jack
right jack bangs
guy was always talking bout fixing the place up
maybe get a better crowd
musta gone and done it while i was in the mountain
pushes map away i dont know this map man
how the hell am i supposed to tell you what door goes where
they wouldnt have changed the security setup
when i worked there this was bangs office
he kept a little safe in the
uh the wall money held take for himself skim from the indians
called it the
stumbling the powwow safe
the powwow safe
his personal safe he gave it a name
now youre telling me theyve taken his office put the buffet there
then who knows what else they changed
gabriel stares at him suspicious
so what the hell good are you
youd have to get me inside
carefully get inside watch where the moneys moving see where the guards are going
then i could work with your map
you walk in there they recognize you
they recognize him theyll remember him after the job goes down
they wont recognize me
they wont recognize me
well trust you when were rich
cause youre gonna get me a disguise
rudy locks eyes with gabriel
i give you the wrong information youre gonna shoot me
well i dont know your damn map
so you can either find a way to get me in there
or you can shoot me right now
a waitress comes over drops their check on the table
it rests near rudy
rudy locks eyes with gabriel
and pushes the check his way
the motor city monster rumbles along a two lane blacktop
across barren michigan tundra
a sign reads you are now entering powahachee indian lands
gabriel drives with ashley beside him
rudy sits in the sleeper jumpy sitting guard
they pass a brightly neon lit building with a parking lot full of cars
the tomahawk casino with a red neon axe pointing the way
and a marquee which reads x odds on craps
prime the truck motors on by
gabriel nods to rudy bring back some memories nick
more than you know
a midwestern castles and camelot themed chain hotel amidst an outcrop of roadside exit civilization fast food and gas
the great lakes trucking rig parked in the hotels lot
faux stonemasonry and torches
regal purple carpets
gabriel and his crew escort rudy into his quarters
jumpy marches rudy to the bed snaps a handcuff around his ankle what the hell is this
what happened to working together
and snaps the other cuff to the bedframe
rather be back in the mountain
might as well be
dont have weather channel in the mountain nick
gabriel tosses him a tv remote
merlin rips the rooms phone out of the wall takes it
they return to the hallway
sleep good loverboy
tomorrow you got singing for your supper to do
the truckers leave
rudy tugs at his ankle cuff sighs collapses back on the bed
ashley has remained
rudy sits up sees her
get your own room
she approaches instead
gently he said he wanted to talk to you
when he found the letters
he said when your boyfriend gets out i wanna talk to him
i thought he meant back in detroit
i thought he meant but you knew why
knew why didnt ya
ashley stands her ground guilty
i thought wed have a few more days
you to talk me into helping
what he promise you a share of the winnings
well shit judas you shoulda at least gotten that nick
he wants to know how to rob it and hell leave you alone
thats all he wants
breaking down i hate him nick
you know how
so get him outta your life
get out of michigan
they got perfume counters in chicago dont they
not without you
she reaches to touch him
rudy turns his back on her
since when do some trucker pals start thinking big anyway
they run routes mostly east retail stuff warehouses
but gabriel knows some guys in new york miami guys he helps get guns to detroit
hides em with his regular loads
he working for them on this one
he wants to be working for himself someday
and im his ticket
considers whats the last place they took down
gabriel and his guys
whats the last place they robbed
i dont think theyve ever robbed anything before
i think theyve just driven guns
rudy looks at her with new interest
theyve never done a robbery
shrugs theyre truck drivers
for the first time in a long time
then they do need me dont they
they really need me
were gonna get out of here nick
were gonna get out of this
rudy stares at her
the smile gone
get your own room ashley
get your own room
ashley pulls away walks to the door
turns back wanting to say something but rudys not even looking her way
if id told you what he wanted youd have been gone
youd have gotten on that bus and stayed on it
and if thats selfish i am
if thats lying im a liar
but i been dealing with fucked up brother and his fucked up friends for a long time and i was stronger than him then and im stronger than him now
cause he showed up for money
i showed up for love
hard and if youre so ready to make me your enemy
then what did you show up for nick
what did you really want
with a fiery look she strides from the room
rudy stands cant get far cuffed to the bed
checks the end table finds a bible and a deck of cards
out his second floor window is a view of the rear parking lot
rudy watches as a chevy blazer parks and two drunk fishermen get out
the trucks bumper sticker reads ice fishermen do it all year long
rudy watches the good ol boys stumble toward the hotel
he turns back surveys his new prison cell theyve never done a robbery
nods christmas is looking up
the bed has been dragged to the door to the bathroom the comforter and pillow are on the floor miracle on th st
is on the tv and rudy lies asleep on the ground ankle still cuffed
two shadows fall across him
rudy is brusquely dragged out by jumpy and merlin passing ashley who lies asleep in the hall head on a pillow
having romance problems romeo
not with you
they march him onward
rudy glances over his shoulder at ashley
who spent the night at his door
a wood panelled room adjacent to a small indoor pool with arcade games and a dart board
gabriels with pug tossing darts as jumpy and a chain smoking merlin haul rudy in
there any part of the day you dont smoke
there anytime you dont got a mouthful of shit
gabriel thwaps a dart into the board to shut them up
take a look what pugs bought for ya
pug empties a shopping bag on a pinball machine
cowboy boots spurs a black cowboy hat a black rhinestone jacket and a longhaired wig tumbles out
youre going to send me into an indian casino disguised as a cowboy
have you thought this entirely through
put it on
merlin and jumpy shove rudy toward the merchandise
gabriel slams another dart into the board then turns youre a country western singer up from nashville for the the holidays
visiting your grandma on the lake driving into the tomahawk for some scotch and slots
you only play the slots you got that
dont want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you you sidle up to shoot some craps
what kind of half ass cowboy plays the slots
at least gimme video poker
shut the fuck up
you play what your girlfriend plays
ashleys going in with you
you talk to her otherwise you dont talk to nobody
you walk the room as many times as you want but the second you come out i want to know the run of the place
rudy examines his new hair and cowboy gear
do i get a country western name
you get recognized convict you get a country western funeral
the chevy nova crunches into the parking lot in the shadow of the gaudy neon axe
rudys in disguise paste on goatee tinted shades and black cowboy gear
very nashville network
hes wedged between jumpy and merlin wearing handcuffs
gabriel ashley and pug in the back
yknow what guys
i woke up this morning i got a really lucky feeling going on
i mean it im feeling that good
i wouldnt be surprised if i walk in there pull a handle and hit jackpot
hell we wouldnt even have to get out
rudy stamps feet shivering in the cold as merlin unlocks his cuffs
gabriel reaches to help ashley out get your goddamn hands off me she edges toward rudy then stops
a chill still there
you got one hour
im gonna need some money
gabriel hands a bill
what do i do with ten dollars
if were working together here we gotta be working together
i cant walk in there looking like the lone fucking ranger with ten bucks to throw down
you dont want me getting noticed right
not getting noticed costs a guy at least a couple hundred
gabriel glares turns to his crew
mutters rubs his fingers together
merlin pug and jumpy reach for their wallets grumbling
gabriel takes a few twenties from each
rudy nods thanks as gabriel hands him the cash threateningly dont
rudy pockets the wad hooks his elbow for ashley to slip her arm through
grins with a drawl you ready to gamble darlin
she regards him warily but puts her arm in his
to the boys yall take care of my guitar
he tips his hat and strides for the casino entrance
gabriel and his truckers watch them go
grumbles whos robbin who here gabriel
get in there and watch em
watch their every fuckin move
the cascade of jingling and jangling coins fills the brightly lit horrendously carpeted space
wooden beamed ceilings suggest a rustic theme but the neon slots lush green tables and red wheels of fortune are pure midwest vegas
the tomahawk is tiny by nevada standards about the size of a large bingo hall
this morning about fifty gamblers mill about
skimpily dressed cocktail waitresses most of them powahachee indians pimp drinks
bored dealers deal
as the sound of slot machine payoffs suddenly go silent and some scattered cassettes labeled big winners little winners and medium cash
a hand pops the tape currently in the system big big winners and flips it over
the sounds of jingling and jangling return
an office overlooking the casino floor through smoked glass
jack bangs late s silver hair capped teeth shark suit and high blood pressure paces his office
hes got the air of a washed up gameshow host wink martindale peter tommarkin one of those hacks
right now hes all caffeine
theres an s word id really like to throw in the discussion here guys cause its a big part of whats going on
big element kay
its a serious issue serious factor so im just gonna get it out there throw it an out there so we can know it we can talk about it we

two indian governors sit before him
business dressed with overcoats ponytails
one gray haired one jet black
theres no snow in vegas kay

the tribal governors stare him down
we understand the paiutes casino saw a net profit of twelve million dollars last year
the paiutes they cook their books
the waitela reservation made seventeen million
perhaps you have researched this mr
is the snowfall on our side of the lake that much greater than the snowfall on theirs
jack bangs stares at them both
considers his next move im bringing in this great showroom act next week these three russian girls they look like meryl streep they can juggle anything

nobody does that in michigan
the tribe is concerned that many of your
new ideas are not resulting in any new venues

like the paiutes and the waitela
the young man stands stares jack bangs in the eye
we want you doing the job
that we brought you here to do
rudy and ashley move away from a change booth with a bucket of quarters
rudy messes with his cowboy getup noting two security guards punch a code in a private door step inside so does it look a lot different
here and there
restaurant uh thats the main expansion
tablesve been moved around the big mans office i dunno might be upstairs now
they settle at a slot machine
another security guard walks past them
rudy turns his back
that guy knows you
at the door merlin and jumpy enter wandering through the slots
rudy sees them
you start spending your brothers money
im gonna take a circuit around the joint check for any new ins and outs
ill snag us some drinks
as he strides away sotto be careful nick
with rudy ambling among the tables making a show of checking out the layout
in reality hes surveying the gamblers
passing the cage he walks right by jack bangs and the indian governors
jack bangs is all smiles while the governors turn their backs an him and storm out
couple rum and cokes please
you want that rum and coke or rum and pepsi
rudy gives him a strange look
the bartender shrugs
rudy still scans the tables settling on where a trio of college kids are forking over chips
one of thems dark haired with a goatee a sweatshirt and jeans
rudy studies this kid for moment
gimme a goddamn bottle of anything
jack bangs sidles up distraught
the barkeep hands him a bottle
bangs takes a swig
i cant go back to vegas bear
theyll fuckin kill me kay
i cant go back
what does the tribe want
they want gold paved roads is what they want
talking bout the fuckin paiutes
fuckin paiutes are on the interstate
nothing i can do about that man i didnt pick the spot for your reservation
neither did we
yeah yeah whatever
rudy gets his drinks as jack bangs turns his way hey
jack bangs i run the place
nice to have you in the tomahawk
tell me something
rudy winces glancing to see merlin and jumpy watching him
frowns on their faces
does upstate michigan need another roadside casino or does upstate michigan need an international gaming destination
wants outta here roadside casino
jack bangs smile falls flat
well so howd you hear about this place then
word of mouth
rudy shrugs smiles takes off with his drinks
bangs looks sick turns to a fat guy on the next stool over
but before he can ask the guy shakes his head i just stopped in to use the can
bangs turns to the bartender puts his head in his hands i cant go back to vegas bear
from the slots we hear a jackpot payoff
walks rudy as merlin sidles up next to him what the hell was that about he didnt recognize me
back off willya
he didnt recognize me
merlin eyes him darkly but lets him walk on into the slots
as he nears ashley he glances to the blackjack table where the college kid has left
heading for the bathroom hey nick
were up fifty cents
and as a barely dressed cocktail waitress crosses between rudy and ashley blocking her view of him rudy pretends to crash into her splashing the rum and coke into his
own face heyyyy
reaching ashley his goatee is dripping nick what happened there went my
well doesnt seem like securitys all that switched
ash shit this mustache is starting to fall off
i gotta fix this thing hands her his glass drink this for me
he hustles for the bathroom
a moment later jumpy storms by
stops at ashley
he started losing his hair
the college kid is zipping up when rudy slams into his back money in hand crashing him against the wall hundred bucks to wear this jacket jesus man dont kill
nobodys killing you kid
santas giving you a rhinestone jacket and a hundred bucks
merlins at a slot machine watching the hall to the bathrooms
a waitress arrives hands him a beer thanks sister
how are ya
you work here long
since it opened
how long ago was your makeover
no the place
moving everything around
the waitress frowns
the tomahawks looked the same since i started mister
shrugs only the losers change
merlin stares at her
then drops his drink to the floor charging for the bathroom
as merlin crashes in seeing the cowboy hat and jacket back turned adjusting a belt
as the figure turns around
its the college kid
merlin stops in his tracks as rudy crashes into him from a stall kicking his legs out driving his throat into a countertop
merlin hits the ground gagging
rudy wears the kids sweatshirt the college kid shaking hustles out the door
as the college kid in rudys black getup strides out of the bathroom hall walking for the casino exit
from the slots ashley and jumpy glance up seeing him go
from their vantage it looks like rudy
as theyre watching the kid hit the door rudy darts out of the hall heads the other way
gabriel and pug sit sentry seeing the cowboy figure leave the casino
wandering into the parking lot
away from them
where the hells he going
where the hells your sister
as the figure unlocks the drivers door of a trans am get him
pug revs the engine speeds through the lot cutting off the trans am from backing away
gabriel jumps out hauls the cowboy from his car and sees its the college kid
scared shitless oh man
its your jacket isnt it
merlin stumbles out of the bathroom holding his throat
catches jumpy and ashleys eyes from the slots trouble
as rudy charges toward cooks holding a buffet plate aloft medium rare
you call this medium hands them the plate hurries past them and out the to the back of the building
in his stolen clothes he charges across the staff parking area and into the snowy expanse of meadow beyond
running for a thicket of winter woods
merlin and jumpy stride out to join gabriel and pug
ashley follows stumbling to keep up
where the hell did he go
there never was a structure change
this place was built the same from day one
that motherfucker and monster
he was talking with the casino manager
nick was talking to him
rudy races as best he can through the waves of snow
he keeps struggling losing his footing fighting his way toward the cover of trees
from far away
rudy turns back to see merlin jumpy and pug round into view back at the parking lot
they see him
and charge into the snowfield
rudy breaks into the trees
gabriel pushes ashley into the nova and peals out of the parking lot
onto reservation roads
rudy darts among barren oaks and brush pines crunching deeper into snowdrifts slowing him down
stumbling forward shivering breath frosting as merlin jumpy and pug reach the treeline
gaining but struggling too
with guns held
rudy keeps battling through the drifts as gunshots start to ring out
rudy glances back to rest the truckers are a hundred yards distant
but as he turns to struggle on treebark splits apart beside him
rudy keeps running
bouncing over a snowy dirt road having found a shortcut into the woods
gabriel searches the trees ashley too
merlin jumpy and pug keep up their steady march
rudys running figure now only fifty yards distant
you keep running nick
keep running now
cant keep warm if you dont keep running
well just be right back here
keeping track of your trail
angle to show merlins striding right in rudys bootprints
pug fires off two shots
they kick up snow just behind rudy struggling panting
wherever you run
well get there
fast as you want
well be there
we drive for a living nick
twelve fifteen twenty hour days
rudys anguished ducking behind some pines trying to brush away his footprints
realizes its useless
a bullet whistles through the pine branches
we got nothing but time
rudy takes a breath crashes onward then stops at the sound of a rumbling
its a cars engine
rudy spins for the source focuses and manages to make out a snow covered dirt road fifty yards away down a swale
another bullet smashes treebark
rudy runs for it
as rudy leaps out to wave down the car as around the corner comes a chevy nova with gabriel and ashley inside
gabriels eyes widen he floors the gas racing right for rudy
rudy scampers toward the opposite roadside a steep wooded slope cradling a meadow and frozen river no
as ashley grabs gabriels steering wheel swerving the other way
gabriel fights her for control as the nova just misses rudy who dives off the road hits the slope and tumbles head over heels toward its bottom a hundred feet
down kicking up geysers of snow
on the road the nova skids to a stop
ashley and gabriel leap out as merlin jumpy and pug reach the road
rudy pops to his feet a dazed snowball
gabriel grabs a rifle from the nova steps to the slope top edge and takes aim as ashley suddenly slams into him from behind sending the both of them tumbling
down the slope
sliding and tangled the rifle flying from gabriels grasp where they come to a tangled snowy halt
gabriel struggles to clear the ice from his face as the butt of his rifle cracks him in the jaw
thats for reading her mail
he extends a hand to ashley come on
and hauls her to her feet
as gabriel howls the two of them scramble away from the woods rudy with the rifle toward the meadow and its frozen pond
more gunshots ring as merlin jumpy and pug slide their way down the ravine
rudy and ashley race out across the ice
the tractions slippery but theres no way around
theres a highway bridge two hundred yards away with sparse truck traffic
we get to the bridge were all right
nick the ice is get to the bridge
waving at traffic he grips her hand tighter as shots crash into the ice at their feet
suddenly the ground splinters and gives way and ashley goes plummeting through to the river
she vanishes from sight in an instant
rudy scrambles back onto sturdy ice
he stares stunned at the ripples in the freezing water
ashleys not coming up
looks to the truckers in pursuit
coming down the ridge
then the highway
safety within sight
but he cant run
cursing himself he grips the rifle tightly and leaps into the ice hole plummeting underwater the temperature hitting his body like needles
he writhes spinning around and sees ashley ten yards away desperately pounding at the ice above her
strength giving out
rudy struggles to her wrapping an arm around her
she fights panicked clawing at the ice both of them pulled further away from the opening
with ashley safely in hand rudy raises his rifle arm pressing the barrel against the ice above them and fires
a hole blasts a shaft of light into the gray blue
rudy fires again
another hole caves in
ashley reaches for a sheath of ice splashing clutching frozen ground treading water
rudy surfaces beside her the both of them gasping facing the bridge
instinctively they spin around standing right behind them
rubs his jaw at the rate youre going nick
im gonna have a hard time ever considering you family
he extends his hand a gesture of help
how lucky ya feeling now
we can barely make out a huddled fetal form quaking and trembling
dripping wet on the verge of hypothermia
trying to stay conscious i i i i have n n no g g gifts to br br bring pa rum p p p p p struggling pum pum pum
n n no treasures for the k k k waits king
the trailer doors swing open crashing harsh light upon him
he squints into the light shivering madly
pa rum pum pum pum
gabriel is hurling darts again focused expressionless
merlin and jumpy haul rudy in
he collapses at gabriels feet unable to stand
a couple kids scamper into the doorway game rooms closed
and merlin slams the door in their face
gabriel hurls another bullseye then retrieves his darts from the board
a for effort nick honestly a for effort and an honorary degree
im surprised you never escaped from the mountain
teeth chattering never
nick heres what were gonna do
in the spirit of the season im going to give you a chance
i understand youre unhappy
right outta the lockup here against your will its the holidays and theres reruns on beat so were gonna have a contest
gabriel strides back to him with two darts
were each going to get one of these
whichever one of us hits closer to the bullseye
gets what he wants
beat you land closer you get ashley
and you guys get to go free
i land closer
and we start getting your help
he lifts rudys shaking hand puts a dart in it
rudys fingers are half frozen they dont bend
gabriel has to wedge it in
may the best sportsman win
gabriel turns to the board ten feet away and tosses his dart
it thunks in the wedge of the outermost ring
he steps aside for rudy
rudy struggles to raise his hand trembling badly
he focuses on the board teeth chattering tries to reposition his fingers rears back and throws except the dart remains in his frozen grip
he brings his icy hand back tries to move his fingers
and the dart finally tumbles out and hits the floor at his feet
gabriel smiles steps close
got something to say to me nick
two out of three
gabriel grabs his jacket and hurls him backward
rudy crashes into a chair flanked by video games
whatd you tell that casino manager
you were talking to him
whatd you tell him
i promise nothing
gabriel spins to the dartboard pulls out a fistful and wheels
he whistles a dart at rudys head
it smacks the wall beside his ear
he whistles another
it trunks right above his head
a third hits the wall by his chin
he thought i was some gambler
he didnt know me
he didnt recognize me
i been driving rigs a long time nick
four five million miles of road
worked for people who wouldnt keep me on less i was driving fifteen hours a day
tell em i needed sleep i needed rest shit theyll hire someone else
gabriel flings another dart
just misses rudys other ear
dispatchers screaming for me to haul ass hes got a load on the runback for me
shippers making me wait for the pickup receivers bitching bout the count
another dart nails the wall right through rudys hair
got the cops at the bottom of every mountain got the dot at the top
and every day every day i see all those faces in their little airbag hot wheels moms and pops and jam faced kiddies giving me that look to go to
hell and get off their happy goddamn highway
they dont gotta get two thousand miles by sundown or the gang dont eat come sunrise
gabriel strides to rudy sitting stock still his head ringed by darts
stares him down
its time for me
to be working for me
i want mine nick
and i need you
frightening calm did you tell your manager theres gonna be a robbery
gabriel pulls the darts free
backs away again
he asked me
how id heard about his place
he didnt know it was me
and then lowers it
believing hes gotten a reprieve rudy relaxes his shivering coming under control
just dont start trying to hit me
i been trying to hit you
gabriel rears back and whistles another dart
it plugs into rudys chest
gabriel fires another skewering him in the ribs
then a third fourth and fifth
rudy howls in pain his body too numb to defend itself
five darts protrude from his chest colorful plastic feathering and spreading rivulets of blood
maybe thatll help sharpen your memory
gabriel stalks close
tonight were gonna take another look at that map
and this time youre gonna tell me what i need to know
rudy gets hurled inside by merlin and jumpy
he hits the floor beside the bed where ashley sits prisoner
pug sits guard watching how the grinch stole christmas on tv
jesus nick she falls to his side
merlin cuffs rudys ankle again to the bedframe
he and jumpy head out pug
pugs engrossed in the cartoon
theyre singing in whoville
pug snaps to
shuts off the tv spits some chaw on the floor and gone
rudy and ashley are left alone
nick oh my god whatd he do to you
whatd he do
she touches his bloodied chest
rudy winces badly
he had some points to make
ashley helps pull his shirt off sees the wounds jesus christ stay here dont move stay right here near delirium all i wanted
was to make it home
for a little of dads turkey and moms stuffing
aunt lisbeths acorn gravy
aunt marys cranberry buns
ashley has leapt to the bathroom
she brings wet washcloths back to clean and dress well get there baby
well get there
havent had cranberry buns
in five whole years
two years nick
you havent had cranberry buns in two years
she kisses him softly
rudy meets her eyes
staring to get his bearings back
you saved my life
beat you could have run but you didnt
you saved me
you saved me
i saved you because i love you nick
smiles whyd you save me
rudy studies her hopeful face attending to his wounds
still weak and distant guy i was in with
i used to read your letters to him
i know they were private
i know but
you spend twenty four hours a day with somebody you gotta talk yknow
you gotta share
or the room gets even smaller
beat and sometimes id be reading them and hed close his eyes get a smile on his face
and id know somewhere inside he was pretending you were writing to him hed see your face your pictures on the wall
beat some nights i think he fell in love with you too
rudy touches a hand to her hair
you gave a couple guys hope ashley
and with hope there aint nothing you cant survive
ashley stares touched still kneading the cloth into his chest
rudy struggles up his face level with hers
she kisses him tenderly
and this time rudy responds mouth seeking working down her neck
her eyes flutter closed
im sorry nick
im so sorry
dont say my name
i love you nick
dont say it
dont say my name
carefully strokes his chest
hes still kissing her softly still somewhat delirious
a small frown i love you
as he returns to her lips mouths joining
ashleys eyes close again as they fold into each other
and move slowly tenderly back to the floor
a bitter cold sunset
through a rooms window rudy and ashley lie tangled in sheets on the carpet
ashley nestles against him
rudy stares skyward
theyll have guns
you said theyve run guns in their trucks
so theyll have guns
to do this robbery
theyll have serious guns
i dont know
well need one
theres a new look in rudys eyes
im going to have to be inside that casino
when it happens
ill need to be part of it
i cant just be drawing some map
nick what are you talking about
we need to find a way to make me part of it
rudy meets her eyes
if were helping them with their robbery were gonna be doing more than just walking away
like thats some christmas bonus
he nods scheming the way hes always known
you want him outta your life
you want a real new year to look forward to
bravely if were gonna do this
were gonna do it to get it all
a medieval themed biergarten
a happy family of five sits at a booth singing along to good king wencelas
in the booth beside merlin and pug are holding court
merlins puffing smoke rings
pug watches dully chewing knew a guy in joliet smoked ten packs a day like you
his lungs got so black they couldnt find em with an x ray
i used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there
shit rotted out his tongue had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk
you ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue
the happy family stops singing
pug considers spits a wad
the guy from joliet those black ass lungs were the least of his problems
got so much smoke in him his lungs couldnt even hold it
got into his system man
into his blood
coming out his ears man coming out his eyes
guyd be walking the row smoked be puffing out his skin
the happy family trade discomfited looks
merlin shrugs takes another drag
met a girl in a bar one night she didnt know his situation
hes drunk shes drunk they get to mackin hot and heavy and the woman swallows it
sucks it right down
my guy would walk into a room set off the goddamn sprinklers
his lips went next
you ever see some silicon fucking lips
the happy family flees their booth
pug and merlin glance over
and grab their leftovers
rifling the grub with disgust vegetarians
behind them gabriel and jumpy file into the biergarten leading rudy and ashley to the booth
rudy battered and freezer burnt gets shoved in first
gabriel throws down the casino map start singing
i have no gifts to bring pa rumpum pum pum sing it in pictures nick
rudy takes the map glances at ashley and then takes charge
for the first time hes giving the orders what you gotta worry about first is the guards
place doesnt look much richer than when i worked there so lets figure youre gonna have to deal with ten of em
therell be two on the floor walking the room that leaves eight up above
eyes in the sky
they see something up theyre the ones wholl hit the silent alarm and youre fucked
how do we take them out
you gotta get someone upstairs
how do we do that
rudy takes the map points to the gaming tables area across from blackjack theres a security doorway
whats the code
they change it every month
i wouldnt know
beat if theres trouble on the floor youll get security coming through
what you gotta do is get inside that doorway once they do
you gotta draw em out
without having them hit the alarms
i got an idea on that one
once youre up there you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there
theres a security camera room that videotapes everything
youve gotta destroy every last one of those tapes
what about the money
you lock down security you move behind the cage
you hit the count room
therell be a guy in there but hes got no guns rooms accessed by another code
cashiersll know it
theyll have alarms
what about the powwow safe
the powwow safe
the secret safe
you said the managers got a safe in his office where he hides skim money
thats uh upstairs
his confident manner wavers
gabriel notices narrows his eyes
rudy quickly grabs the map again so
youre gonna need a man through here two men at the cage one to cover the count
youre gonna need a lookout outside a sweeper through the back and a gun guarding the front
beat you need six
we got five
putting ashley outside
you need six
gabriel eyes him darkly
you go in with five youre either leaving an alarm free or an exit free
someone hits an alarm youre fucked
someone gets to a phone gets outside cross the street whatever youre fucked
you need six
nods six is me
you guys get caught i go away for good
i got an interest in making sure you dont
you need a sixth man covering an exit
whatre you gonna do about it
whatre you gonna do about it
she puts an arm around rudy smiles
thats her man
i want a map of that security level
every room every guard every thing
six men means six guns
im no threat without a gun
no youre not
therell be people in that casino
i cant keep them from leaving if i dont get a gun
i dont need bullets monster
but i gotta be a threat
whats the matter gabriel
this is what you wanted him for isnt it
gabriels eyes dont leave rudys
what you guys have to plan out then
is how youre going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anythings wrong
running in with ski masks and bullets flying aint gonna do it
that part nick
was planned out the day i read your letters
we all gonna dress up like cowboys
not cowboys nick
not on christmas eve
pulled open to reveal five santa claus suits hanging side by side
red polyester coats and pants white felt trim and black buckles black boots and red caps
as gabriel lifts a santa claus suit and presses it against rudy
ashley merlin jungy and pug look on
you gotta be kidding me
tis the season convict
he puts the suit back in the locker pulls another
finding rudys size
cant be attracting attention right
what we walking in there and delivering toys
he turns to see merlin open another locker
this one stacked with rifles carbines and handguns
of a floor plan a sheet of paper overlaid on gabriels map of the casino
a pencil draws a boxy room and labels it security video room
then an eraser wipes it out
still cuffed to the bedframe pulled close to a desk
hes sitting working on the security level map
the door opens ashley enters looking worried he wants to see your map
im almost done
he says he wants it now
if he wanted a photographic memory he shoulda kidnapped one
im working on it here
ashley walks over puts her arms around his neck
whispers how are we gonna do this nick
youre the getaway girl
the moneys gonna get to you eventually
gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it
but i cant do that without a gun
any luck talking to him
bullets or no bullets he wont do it
is there any way you could get into his truck
we need a gun ash
we need a gun
rudy studies his map then quickly pencils in the security video room in a totally different place than he drew it before
hands the paper to her
heres the picasso
is he in his room
they all are
nods thinks keep em there for a little while
ashley takes the map frowns
rudy kisses her gently
were gonna get you out of detroit ash
get you out of beauty and fragrances
smiles then remember that
after all this is over when you know me when you really know me
remember it was me
she searches his eyes not quite understanding
rudy smiles back nods toward the door
ashley slips out
when shes gone rudy stands and turns to the window
outside the blazer with the ice fishermen do it all year long bumper sticker still sits parked
rudy reaches for his jeans pocket and pulls out one of the game room darts flecked with blood
rudy lies on his back under the bed frame dart in hand
he tears off the plastic feathering to get at the cross shaped end furthest from the tip
four protruding metal edges
he finds the phillips screws on the bedframe and tries to work the dart end into the grooves
it scrapes and jags but with pressure hes able to do a quarter turn at a time
the screw starts spiraling out
as two metal pieces split apart and rudy wriggles his ankle handcuff off the frame
as rudys hand grabs a paper covered wire hanger and rips the paper off untwisting the wire
as rudy slides it open and climbs outside
light snow falling
rudy drops from the second floor window into some snowy shrubs and an empty parking space
he stealthily darts ahead to the ice fishermens blazer
rudy peers in the windows spotting fishing rods tackle and gear boxes in the back seat
he takes his wire coat hanger now stretched straight and slips it between the drivers window and moulding jamming it around until it trips the door lock
the lock pops up rudy pops in and raids the gear box
bait reels fishing wire
a first aid kit
gun gun cmon boys like you gotta be keeping a gun
he rustles around in the backseat
ice cooler open bag of pork rinds another gear box
some headlights sweep past the blazer
rudy ducks down pockets the switchblade
munches some pork rinds
rudy scrambles out heads to try another car a pickup truck
and then suddenly drops to the ground seeing stride outside talking casually kicking snow on their way toward the nova
voices too low to hear
rudy crouches behind the pickup slips around the other side
merlin and jumpy walk right by him
rudy criss crosses through the parking lot hidden by cars heading away from his rooms window
rudy glances back to see if the truckers notice that but they dont seem to
they stand at the nova talking
rudy shivers waiting
theyre not leaving
when their backs turn rudy dashes twenty feet to the cover of the building
he slips around the corner out of sight
rudy hops through snowdrifts pressed to the wall moving toward a side entry when he stops hearing a womans laughter
above his head are a row of windows
reflections of rippling water on the ceiling inside
its the hotel pool behind this wall
sounds of splashes
rudy stands absolutely still
his breaths stop frosting
because his breathing has stopped
rudy creeps down the darkened hall past a sign that reads pool closed
open am to pm no lifeguard on duty
rudy steps closer back to a wall standing in shadow
the small pool becomes visible flickering blue water
from an unseen end a figure splashes backwards into view its ashley
hair wet naked beneath the surface
smiling and splashing someone offscreen and hes saying were not gonna help him just to walk away
if were gonna help him
were gonna get it all
she splashes again
taunting he wants to help now he wants to rob it now we could probably stay right here hed go on and rob it by himself as gabriel steps into
view also undressed moving toward her in the pool
he wants the money
he wants me
gabriel reaches her puts his arms around her
whoever she is
and they kiss entwining together reflections and ripples
a steamy embrace
nick masons gonna help us more than we ever dreamed
in the shadows hearing them
staring into darkness
gabriel turns with ashley wrapped together
all those letters are about to pay off baby
all those letters
to all those cons
searching for a money man
we musta written what twenty of em
and they were before this guy
one two letters apiece ten to the racetrack guy in leavenworth till he fucked his parole plus the forty to mason
how many letters is that
thats a book baby
presses closer thats a book of love
they kiss again
gabriel strokes her wet hair i cant take watching you touch him
i cant take his hands on you
one more day baby
one more day to christmas
ive been doing good though
didnt have to hit me so fucking hard
didnt have to throw me outta the goddamn truck
didnt have to send me down a fucking mountain
what he should see me help you catch him
still in the shadows welling with betrayal
hes shown us the setup hes drawn us the map hes helped us do the plan
he wants a gun give him a gun
take the bullets out whatever but give him the gun
the more manpower weve got in there the better
he wont try and make his move till the moneys in hand
hell be dead when he does
gabriel and ashley rock slowly coupled in the water
yknow something baby
if you were my sister
id still want to wake up christmas morning with you
and id still want to be the tinsel round your tree
and as their words turn to moans and murmurs
rudy is gone
rudy strides a corridor eyes dead ahead passing a stairwell on his way toward the exit sign posted above a door
hes almost there marching fast heres my present to you truck drivers where the hells gabriel
and rudy dives to the stairwell out of sight just as merlin and jumpy stride back inside
with his girlfriend
making up for nick time
im going down to the bar you want something
get me a brew
im gonna check on our convict
they separate jumpy down the hall merlin to the stairs merlin trudges upward while rudy steps from hiding one flight down
checks the hall for jumpy then races out rudy slams out the side door scrambling straight for the same blazer
he jimmies the lock again leaps in tears free the engine panel and searches for ignition wires like a pro
stripping the plastic trying to spark contact catch dammit catch
like riding a bike its like riding a bike
but theres nothing
the engine wont start
merlin reaches the second floor steps into the hall
rudy jumps from the blazer looks at the lot the highway the woods
his own footprints in the dusting snow
how far you gonna get rudy
realizing the answer rudy looks to his rooms window
forced to race back
he tries clambering the wall standing an shrubbery but he cant reach
he whirls desperate
and his eyes find the blazer
merlin ambles the corridor
approaching rudys room
rudy flings open the blazer door slams the emergency brake down
forces the gearshift into reverse
merlin reaches rudys door
searches his pockets for the key
rudy darts to the front of the blazer slipping and sliding on asphalt ice
he drops to his knees pushing on the front bumper
the wheels start to move
merlin finds a room key
puts it in the lock
turns the handle but the door wont open
merlin checks the key
the blazer starts to roll backwards toward the snowy shrubs ringing the building
headed for the empty parking space below rudys window
rudy keeps pushing
the blazer picks up speed rolling on its own
merlin searches his pockets again finds the right key
the blazer rolls toward the building
rudy scrambles to his feet runs after it leaps his left foot onto the bumper the right foot onto the hood then onto the roof getting two roof steps worth
of running start as the blazer slows to a rest against the snowy shrubs and rudy dives into the air torpedoing himself right through the window to his room where he crashes headlong to the floor turning a somersault and landing sprawled across the carpet
the key in the lock merlin hears the crash and as merlin opens the door he finds rudy sitting calmly on the floor ankle cuff locked once again to the
spreading a deck of cards out before him
starting a game of solitaire
he looks up
merlin frowns takes a suspicious look around the room
the windows open
rudy continues his card game
merlin watches him for a long time
then pulls the door shut
once hes gone rudy collapses to the floor
breathing hard heart pounding
the cards go flying
the lights go out
rudy creeps back to the window checks outside
and stops still
in parking lot
a cigarette glow burns inside the nova
from the drivers seat
rudy steps back into the shadows
closing window and watches the falling snow
caged again after all
rudy asleep on the floor as ashley creeps back in
seeing hes asleep she lies beside him pulls a blanket over them both nestles into his body and kisses him
merry christmas eve my love
my love my love
merry christmas eve
ashley closes her eyes
with a smile
a moment later rudys eyes open
turning to look at her smiling sleeping face
with a convicts vengeful stare
in a elfin cap smiling cheerfully hello gentlemen
and how can we help you on this holiday morning
three grim faces
the three truckers stride to the nova where jumpy guards rudy and ashley
in the b
the ice fishermen are by their car wondering how the hell it switched parking spaces overnight
gabriel marches straight to rudy and slugs him in the gut
rudy hits the snow gabriel
thats for the hundred bucks worth of pay per view
then kicks him and thats for the two hundred you took outta your minibar
chokes pained you guys were paying for the room i just figured gabriel kicks him again then pulls a handgun points it at rudys head
ashley screams rushes him as gabriels gun shoots a thin stream of water into rudys face
its a forty five caliber squirt gun
cruel smile you wanted a weapon convict
you got one
gabriel tosses the water pistol onto rudys chest
jumpy and pug haul him up
with venom merry christmas eve
the motor city monster cruises the snowy landscape with lake superior beyond
pug drives the nova in convoy
gabriel hands copies of rudys sketched map to merlin and jumpy
rudy and ashley are in the sleeper
commit this thing to memory
every guard every exit
dont tape it to your fuckin wrist remember it
thats the gospel right there
matthew mark luke and john
rudy watches them studying his made up map
ashley strokes his arm gives a loving smile
rudy stares at her
he smiles right back
the rig and the nova blow by a roadsign now entering powahachee indian reservation lands
the storage locker with the santa suits slams open
merlins hands pull automatics and shotguns from the weapons chest
pugs hands unload ammo
a red and white santa coat gets pulled on and buttoned up
jumpys hands apportion guns and ammo on a picnic table
black santa boots stamp tight in the snow
a shoulder strap assault rifle gets hidden under a santa coat
ammo clips are taped inside a fat black buckle belt
a handgun gets tucked under a santa hat
and the rigs trailer doors come crashing shut
lake superior shimmers in the dying light
the rigs in the empty rest area lot
on a nearby bank four men in santa claus suits and one woman without sit scattered at picnic tables guns at their sides
staring out at the lake
sit apart from the rest
rudy in a red suit black boots cap in hand
ashleys head is in his lap watching the sky
where should we go nick
when were gone from here
where should we go
the nova drives into the lot
pug gets out carrying several fast food bags
hurrying to stay warm okay who had the cheeseburger with bacon what about a roast beef ive got two roast beefs here cheeseburger n bacons mine i got a bacon
too there another bacon in there
i got a bacon for him and a bacon for me theres four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs somebody better give me something with some goddamn bacon as they continue
chow dispersal rudy stares over the lake
not even aware ashleys there
this time right now
dads stacking wood out back getting ready for tomorrow
little blaze in the fireplace
moms setting out the good silver hanging her cinammon sticks up in the doorways
getting out her scratchy old records
rudy smiles to himself
hes got a faraway look
i dont know where youre going
but im going home
we go together nick
we go together
im going home
sits by the water staring over the lake too
with a white cotton santa beard resting on his chin
he unwraps his roast beef sandwich pulls his beard down to his neck and takes a savage bite
munches away stares to rudy and ashley
she meets his eyes
and looks again to the water
the snowy rest stop the glistening lake
and the six figures scattered watching day turn to night
the neon axe lit up in full regalia with christmas lights now strung along the buildings roof
there are fewer than a dozen cars in the parking lot
filled with the jingling jangling slots but theres only two fat women sitting at them
three indians at a poker table
an old timer in his s playing blackjack
a ragged headquarters looking down to the casino level through smoked glass
desks file cabinets pin up centerfolds
a room with video monitors to one side
stairs to a camera catwalk that rings the casino
jack bangs is at a table of wassail and cookies
he opens a battle of brandy pours a bit into the punch and takes the bottle for himself
walks over to his head of security watching the lack of activity below and all through the house
not a creature was stirring
sighs why dont you go ahead and send most of your guys home ed
merry x mas
the boss smiles heads off
jack bangs swigs his brandy eyes his high tech security gear glumly hell
nobody even comes here to cheat
the nova pulls into the lot and parks
merlin pug and ashley inside
on the road the motor city monster slows to an idling stop
in the cab gabriel turns to rudy and jumpy go
rudy gives gabriel a withering look
he and jumpy climb out
gabriels rig rumbles up the road
note all five men save ashley from now till storys end are in their santa claus suits
make their way across the lot heading for the entrance
hey jumpy i want to ask you something
you have any problem with the fact that were on our way to take millions of dollars from an indian casino
the native american considers
as they walk nick
its true that indian gamings gone a long way toward restoring wealth and pride to communities whove been economically isolated and enslaved for centuries
stronger infrastructure better schools higher employment
theyre all the results of reservation casino success stories
still many natives believe that these are temples to a godless materialism and greed that will only infect the souls of indigenous peoples until their love of money has destroyed
the spiritual values their ancestors died to protect and their homelands have become no different from any united states suburb satellite city or industrial park
destroying the indian legacy once and for all and leaving behind a nation of selfish angry natives of which i its true am one as they hit the tomahawks doors
and slam inside stumbling into each other suddenly laughing and slapping backs
surveying the casino hey hey egg nog for everybody
rudy spreads his santa arms wide and whoops
jumpy laughs with him steadying his balance
drunken and slurred lets win some money
money money the few gamblers inside look up at the commotion
bear the bartender
two cashiers and one waitress
ed the security boss strides over smiling tightly how you gentlemen doing tonight
were out of work tonight thats how

shakes his hand hi santa claus how are you

rudy grabs a wad of bills from his pocket drops some to the floor
jumpy retrieves them bunch of us got together for the union party
hey how late are you open

a waitress sidles close checks with the boss
he nods okay

santa drinks american beer
to jumpy whats your game guys

the security boss stares him down
then good luck gentlemen
he steps aside and indicates the tables
jumpy claps him on the back pushes rudy on through the slots
gabriels truck at the roadside hazards on with signal triangles as if broken down
gabriel places the last one hurries back down the casino road
ashley sits between merlin and pug
gabriel jogs by the car
ashley checks her watch three minutes
rudy and jumpy sit at a blackjack table beside the old timer
jovial ad libs as the waitress brings rudys beer
rudy doubles down busts and gets belligerent to the old timer that was my card pop

to the waitress how are you tonight

behind them gabriel slams through the casino doors

gabriel sidles to the table claps rudy on the back

the waitress circles around what can i get ya santa
the old timer hits and stays
rudy hits and busts pop

ashleys eyes on her watch
nods to merlin and pug go
jumpy has left the table sidling to a change booth glancing at his watch
passes a bill could fat man with flying horse get some quarters please
gabriel slides off his stool punches rudy in the shoulder be back wal mart

rudy nods slugging beer
hes becoming an unruly drinker
the old timer motions to hit but before the dealer can pull the card rudy slams the table points to it that is my card guy
he hit mister
he didnt hit
to old timer you didnt hit
youre not hitting
but you dont even know what it is
the dealer hits grandpa to twenty one
then hits rudy and busts him
rudy stares darkly
gabriel walks to the mens room door
adjusts the rifle under his red coat
and turns back
jumpy is handed a bucket of quarters
merlin and pug march toward the entrance hands in pockets
the security boss returns upstairs beside jack bangs whos watching the video monitors
on one screen a parking lot cam shows merlin and pug approaching theres two more coming
hell there we go
thats the spirit
he drunkenly clinks his battle to the security boss wassail
the boss frowns
is there a union for department store santas
rudy bolts up suddenly sends chips and his chair to the carpet
points sternly at the old timer slurring switch seats with me
youre taking my money
switch seats with me
switch seats with me if youre not taking my money im ninety two years old then get yourself another table
youre hitting santas cards and youre taking santas money
there is no other table rudy grabs the blackjack table and wrenches with all his might overturning it cards chips cash scattering two security guards at the door
rush for rudy gabriel steps from the restroom hall moves toward the keypad door to the security level jumpy carries his bucket of quarters past the cage rudy tackles the
old timer fists and false teeth flying as the guards arrive trying to wrench him off the poor guy hard whisper stay down pop
trust me stay down
as gabriel stops just beyond the keypad door the security boss grabs more men while jack bangs merely smiles at the sight
guards wrestling a drunken santa help them down there
three guards charge out of the keypad door right past gabriel who slips deftly inside opening his coat pulling his assault rifle right at the top of the stairs right
at the top of the stairs
charging to the top starting right and running smack into a wall
he spins sees the doorways on his left with three doors
gabriel stops at the first grips his gun video room video room and swings open a closet bathroom
he frowns confused
jumps to the second door map said video room and swings open a storage closet
gabriel grumbles leaps to the third door and flings it open map said goddamn video room
with two guards sitting at their posts and jack bangs the security boss and the video guard in the doorway to the video room
which is on the far opposite side of the space
as they turn to see the furious santa claus with the ak as he sprays the ceiling with gunfire
where the rifle sounds just as jumpy grips his bucket of quarters at the cashiers cage and wheels throwing a fragmentation grenades worth of quarters at the two cashiers
bits of metal flying between the bars
they scream stepping backwards in defense and jumpy whips a sawed off shotgun from his coat step back from the desks
the five guards wrestling rudy spin and scramble pulling pistols from shoulder holsters as charges through the casino entrance shotgun held from the floor but the guards dont
whirling on merlin who opens fire blasting two of the guards off their feet
rudy stays on the ground covering his head holding the petrified old timer down as the other three guards fire back forcing merlin to race behind the slots
bullets rip into slot machines as gunshots ring out from the casino restaurant
two of the guards spin to look behind them as pug storms in contorted glee twin pistols blazing popping a steel flurry into an outgunned guard
merlin spins from hiding behind the slots
he and pug both open fire blowing away the two remaining men from both sides
one of the guards falls in front of rudy gun in hand but as rudy reaches for the guys pistol hold it right there nick
your squirt guns all you need
merlin steps to him gun aimed
he and pug collect the guards weapons
rudy gets to his feet pulls the water pistol from his pocket
moves to round up the old timer the waitress the poker players and the fat slots women
but what the hell were you doing here an christmas eve anyway
the two guards lie on the floor with security boss and video guard
and the ruined jack bangs
gabriel storms to the video rooms doorway
slams a new clip
im begging kay
this is not some card club kay
this is the tomahawk
were an international gaming destination
were in guidebooks
you cant do this
you cant do this to me
he opens fire blowing away the wall of monitors and vcrs recording the robbery
sparks and metal fly
ashley waits in the nova checking her watch
behind her a red wrangler rolls in and parks
a fire chief and his deputy just off duty stroll toward the casino laughing
ashley sinks low panicked
presses her horn
the firemen spin around but dont see her
rudy forces the gamblers and employees behind the bar
onto the floor with bear the bartender whispering hard get down and stay down and youre gonna be fine
just dont do anything
my friends are disturbed the hostages do as told
rudy breathes relief squirt gun in hand
and then stares at the array of bottles around him
merlin and pug force the cashiers to the floor whats the security code to the count room
what security code
you just use a key
pug bangs the guys head off the floor stalks to the count room door
just a key lock
pug blows it away with his guns kicks the door open and gets shot to hell by three count men inside pistols blazing
pug puppets dead
a wad of chaw hits the ceiling
stunned merlin fires back
as the firemen hear the gunfire pulling holstered pistols while merlin dives out of the cage joining jumpy taking cover as the count men fire away as rudy scrambles back
from the bar you said no guns in there
merlin and jumpy leap up guns blazing firing through the cage bars at the count men
killing all three just as storm through the doors pistols ready merlin and jumpy are caught
trade a look
and let their weapons fall turning just as crashes through the casino doors mowing down the firemen
the car slams inside crashing into slot machines
the slots send sparks showering into the air
which set off the casino floors sprinklers
the room fills with watery spray
ashley swiftly climbs out of the mangled vehicle
rudy stares darkly at her
she knows he knows
and she doesnt care
wild eyed yeah
she storms on by
the slots pay off behind her
jumpy merlin ashley and rudy step inside the count room
there are stacks and stacks of bills
ashley smiles wide throws jumpy three laundry sacks
merlin meanwhile slams rudy against the wall you knew there were guns in here
merlin i didnt know you got pug killed
you tried to get me killed
you just lost your get outta jail free i promise you i didnt know
as merlin puts a gun to rudyls head over casino speakers santa claus santa claus and santa claus
would you please bring our
to the security level
merlin stares daggers at rudy
shoves the gun away
gabriel stands at the windows overlooking the watery carnage
the taped jingle of slots still plays
poor jack bangs lies on his desk beaten to a pulp
blood runs down his face and shark suit
tears and shock i cant go back to vegas
what the hell is with this place
thought the video room was back there merlin and jumpy lead rudy in
they carry bulging money sacks
gabriel stares rudy down
i told you not to fuck us with that map nick
i told you not to and you did
how am i sposed to keep my promises now
ashley joins him hows she sposed to keep hers
he kisses her hard
then points to jack bangs he wont tell us where it is
the powwow safe

gabriel hammers him with the butt of his rifle
the powwow safe where you steal your money
where you cheat your indians
i dont steal any gabriel cracks him again
gabriel grabs rudy pulls him over
we know about the powwow safe
we know its in here
we know how you work
because we know whos worked for you
smiles remember a guy named nick mason
a security guard named nick mason
gabriel pushes rudys head toward the desk
jack bangs drooling blood eyes swollen turns his face to see
jack bangs stares at rudy
rudy stares back
so where is he
laughs mocking where is he
where is he
hes not nick mason
the smile fades from gabriels face
worked for me two years ago
a spark of recognition hes some cowboy
gabriel grabs rudy slams him against a wall
he glares at ashley for answers
she stares in disbelief
rudy meets her eyes
fucked the wrong guy ashley
shrugs story of your life
i did time with nick mason monster
told you that from the start
ashleys putting it all together

ashley charges him
gabriel stops her merlin and jumpy help hold her back
gabriel spins on rudy with his rifle you are lucky convict
youre spending christmas with the birthday boy himself hey
there is a powwow safe
i did time with nick mason remember
i knew he worked here didnt i
well some shit he told me
rudy steels himself for the shot
it still doesnt come
nick told me his manager kept a safe in his office his stealing safe
his powwow safe
i swear please
nick told me
looks to jack bangs behind the liquor cabinet
jack bangs dully meets rudys eyes
gabriel steps to the liquor cabinet feels at the shelves
they split in the middle
and there is a combination safe mounted in the back
gabriel turns to jack bangs open it
he pulls him off the desk
jack bangs wavers struggling
he looks at gabriel
then at rudy
i cant go back to vegas
jack bangs steps to the safe
spins the lock
jack bangs looks at rudy
and jack bangs opens it reaching inside in the same swift motion so that as the safe swings open to reveal its a rack of weapons that lies inside jack
bangs already has an uzi in hand bullets as he turns back to the room sending gabriel ashley and merlin diving for the floor
jumpy cant get down as bullets riddle him dead and blow out the smoked windows overlooking the casino jack bangs keeps turning in a madmans circle blowing out the windows
to the parking lot shattering the liquor sending rudy scrambling under his desk he and ashley both scramble for the windows jumping out with two of the money sacks and landing on poker tables below overturning them jack bangs keeps firing into the casino shredding the tables but missing gabriel and ashley as he jumps right after them
merlin scrambles to his feet whirling with his gun looking for rudy just as rudy slams into him
merlins shot hits the ceiling
the two of them crash down wrestling and rolling toward the parking lot window
two guns spill to the floor
rudy grabs one just as merlin kicks out leaping up and freezes seeing rudys got a pistol on him
before merlin can make a move rudy fires and a thin stream of water shoots out
leaving a stain on his shirt
its the water pistol
rudy stares blankly
as merlin swiftly snatches the second gun a real gun off the floor
rudys dead to rights
im gonna take pleasure in this
with the gun on rudy merlin finds a cigarette in his pockets
pops it between his lips raises a lighters flame and hesitates
sniffing the air
at the stain on his shirt
his lighter still lit me too
and rudy fires the water pistol again this time catching merlins lighter which turns the stream into a arc of fire
hes filled alcohol in the gun
flaming liquor shoots into merlins face and eyes
he drops the handgun
rudy keeps squeezing the squirt gun spreading the fire down his neck and chest
merlin howls wildly and staggers back blind and helpless pinwheeling himself and crashing down on the hood of a pontiac head through the windshield boots on the bumper dead
smoke em if you got em
gabriel and ashley have scrambled to the nova tumbling in with the money sacks
jack bangs gets up stalking toward them still firing and babbling
gabriel fires back hitting bangs in the chest
he staggers but stays upright
his bullets riddle the car shattering the windshield but gabriel and ashley keep their heads down slamming it into reverse and burning rubber backwards out the casino entrance into the
parking lot and speeding out of sight
jack bangs stops shooting
he staggers back toward the bar totters there and turns gun still raised
rudy stands at the base of the stairs to the security level
he puts his hands up until he sees the dying look in bangs face
the uzi drops to the ground
even the slots have stopped
jack bangs stares blankly
surveys the wreckage of his poor mans empire
and gives a small shrug
thats why they call it gambling
he slumps against the bar and hits the floor
rudy ambles out into the snowy night
the lot is quiet
he takes a few wary steps toward the road and hears a click
he turns to see ashley standing behind him with a gun
shaking her pretty head
rudy shuts his eyes for the end
the nova drives up a ramp into the back of the truck in reverse
gabriel gets out pulls shut the trailer
ashley collects the hazard triangles
they hurry to the cab
the motor city monster storms through the night passing a couple police cars sirens wailing speeding the other way
gabriel and ashley inside with the money sacks with the wrong fucking guy
we took the place down with the wrong fucking guy
is that christmas
is that christmas
he grabs ashley kisses her wildly
then turns back where rudy lies sideways hands bound with his santa belt
god bless us every one
a winding two lane road overlooking a small ravine at a grassy overlook
the road is dusted with snow theres been no traffic here for awhile
the motor city monster steams to a stop beyond the overlook
then starts backing up such that the gate of the trailer is fifteen feet from the edge of the ridge
a hundred foot drop into the ravine below
gabriel and ashley pile out of the cab
they lift the trailer gate extend the tire ramps
the ramps run from the trailer to five feet away from the ravine drop
gabriel pulls rudy out of the sleeper
marches him back and gives him a look
forces him to his knees
ashley is in the truck trailer splashing the inside of the nova with a can of gasoline
you almost got away with it santa
got outta the tomahawk got to your car got halfway to canada till you caught some ice in the road
by the time you hit bottom down there whole car was burning like a comet
musta burned up all that money too
rudy glances to the trailer
ashley tosses a couple handfuls of bills into the car
buncha guys in red suits busted in theyll say
they wont be able to remember
if it was three or four
four dead santas and some burned up cash
merry christmas the end
was it your plan monster
or was it hers
gabriel smiles at him
she told me bout the convict magazines
had to figure thered be some boys in the pen with some useful knowledge
with nobody to talk to
nobody to listen
so we stocked up on stationery
ashley hops down
gabriel puts an arm around her
hard life being a truckers girl
rudy eyes ashley
she stares darkly back
i saved your life
you shouldnt have
he did love you you know
he did love you
but rudy doesnt pause
maybe this is where you wanted him ashley
at the bottom of a ravine dead as ice with a burnt up heart
but it didnt happen
cause what you did for him was make him the happiest held ever been
you showed him hope and taught him mercy
and he died a peaceful man
you wanted to destroy some convict
and all you did was save his soul
love your money and remember that
ashley shivers a touch shaken
but steels herself merry christmas rudy
im glad it was me
get in the car
gabriel hauls him up
marches him to the trailer
rudy stops at the ramp
rudy doesnt move
get in the car
howd you know my name
he turns back to ashley
howd you know my name
what are you talking about
rudy looks at gabriel
to ashley you said merry christmas rudy
you told me your name was rudy
you told me a million times back in the truck telling me you werent nick no you were screaming you werent nick
and we just didnt fucking believe you
but i never said rudy
you said it a million times
i never told you my name
he stares her down
then stares at gabriel
howd you know my name was rudy
howd you know my name
ashley stares daggers
shakes her head ruefully men
and pulls a handgun shooting gabriel in the heart
gabriel falls to his knees in the snow his mouth a ring of shock
blood spurts through his red coat
he stares at ashley incredulous
she steps forward and puts another bullet in his neck
gabriel falls still
ashleys breath frosts in the cold
rudy watches her
finally she meets rudys eyes
they stare each other down for a long moment before where is he
no one moves
and finally the crunch of footsteps from around the side of the trailer
a shadow moves across the snow behind the trailer and soon steps into rudy and ashleys view
its nick mason
alive and well
merry christmas rudy
her muscles and mustache man pen pal is here
i missed you beautiful
i missed you too nicky baby
they share a passionate kiss
ashley malts at the sight of him embracing happily
then turns to rudy for your information
i never fuck the wrong guy
rudy just stands there his mind playing catch up
have you two been properly introduced
sweetness this is rudy duncan i did almost a year with him in the mountain
read him all your letters talked about you all the time made him feel like he really knew you
turns to rudy my friend

rudy doesnt notice its started to snow
millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers real big talkers talking bout a real score one day
i was in the mountain man what the hell why not let her get friendly with em
let her tell em an idea she had bout writing guys in prison
getting one who could show em a sure thing

tell her new trucker man shed pose as some sister of his named ashley
and you set me up

way back when i worked there
what better way than to get some guys to rob it for me
prods rudy up the ramp
into the trailer paid the alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me
hes a lifer what does he care
paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story i was dead
once the wound healed up
notes cash sacks got out of the mountain this morning
and tonight im a rich man
howd you know id do it
walk outta there and tell her i was you
nick looks back at ashley
because every time i read her letters rudy
to ashley keep your gun on him
nick forces rudy inside unties the belt from his wrists and lashes them to the bottom of the steering wheel
five santas walked into that tomahawk rudy
thats what the witnessesll say
so we gotta have five santas not walk out
gotta have five
working thisll burn right away
in the fire
nick gets rudys wrists locked to the wheel
hell you never needed to convince ashley you were me
just the dumb fucking truckers
i figured id talked enough about the tomahawk in the pen for you to get by talked about the old mans weapons stash probably forgot id remember hm
theyd have killed you if you werent me rudy
we knew youd start convincing em soon enough
nick slams the car door locking rudy in
they had the weapons and the willpower
we just gave them their inside man
you gave them me
i gave them me
shrugs smiles said some nice things about me rudy
i appreciate it
but dont worry
i do love her
and she loves me
you had that right all along
nick reaches across him releases the brake
puts the car into drive
turns to ashley sweetness
lets light up the tree
ashley steps toward the ramp taking out a matchbook
nick steps further into the trailer to the back of the nova
rudy immediately wriggles his hands trying to touch his wrists together
trying to press together the white cuffs of his santa suit
trying to get the right pressure point as a blade suddenly springs out of the cuff
the switchblade hed stolen from the blazer its lashed to his right wrist
rudy starts sawing his wrist back and forth cutting through the santa belt his hands at the bottom of the wheel too low for either ashley or nick to see
ashley is at the hood of the car lighting her match
nick is at the back bumper ready to push it down the ramp goodbye rudy
nice spending time with you
the belt breaks
rudy snaps his hands free
but instead of trying to escape he reaches under the steering column ripping its panel away and pulling wires free
as ashley tosses her match onto the hood and fire races over the body of the car tongues racing inside over the dash over the seats lapping at rudy who
ducks his head beneath the wheel frantic to locate the right leads ashley jumps out of the way to the snow
nick pushes the flaming car to the trailers edge starting on down the ramp the ravine ahead and as gravity starts to take the metal bonfire rudy sparks two wires
together flames eating at him and the engine ignites
rudy slams the gearshift into reverse grabs the wheel and looks over his shoulder at shocked nick behind him and slams the accelerator
as the burning nova races backwards up the ramp and back into the trailer terrified nick turns to run but theres nowhere to go and the car slams into the
trailers back crushing nicks legs between metal and metal
then rudy faces front pounds the shift into drive
ashley stands at the bottom of the ramp vengeance and rage
she grabs her handgun opens fire and rudy slams the gas again shooting down the ramp as he flings open the car door dives and rolls while the burning nova
collides with ashley throwing her onto the hood and sending the tandem inferno speeding off the ridgetop arcing slowly as it plummets into the ravine a smoking blazing shooting star with a womans figure hanging on
the shooting star hits earth and explodes
the same four shots that opened the film
the santa on the floor of the cage pug the santa on the hood of the car merlin the santa in the hallway jumpy
and the santa lying face down on the snowy road
the last of the opening images
rudys motionless santa figure upside down on the snowy incline bits of his suit still aflame
he opens his eyes
rudy staggers to his feet
battered and dazed
looks at gabriels body
then looks to the trailer
inside nick is still alive bones broken from the waist down
hes mumbling madly staring at the ceiling rudy
rudy climbs the tire ramp
and pulls the trailer gate shut
he climbs into the rigs cab
starts the engine
puts the truck in reverse taps the accelerator and hops out
the truck rolls backwards
and into the ravine
rudy listens to its tumbling sounds all the way to the bottom
he then looks up the road one way
then the other
and notices the two money sacks sitting in the snow
he stares at them
a long time
in his burnt and battered santa suit rudys figure trudges the snowy night
two sacks over his shoulder
walking empty roads and highways
and passing a roadsign that reads sidnaw miles
he passes rural roads and driveways and every time he comes across a mailbox
he puts a stack of cash inside
on the soundtrack the strings and rum pum pum pums of the little drummer boy start to rise with snow falling he passes a new sign sidnaw miles
with the sun rising a pair of children huddle at a window seeing the man in the santa suit at the end of their driveway
giving them something from his sack and ambling on
and we follow rudys march stuffing presents into mailboxes
at every stop on the way
a cul de sac of norman rockwell michigan homes
graced with pines and a pristine snowfall
christmas trees in windows lights on inside figures of families in holiday gear
no one noticing the man in the santa suit his sacks long gone walking up the road
at cul de sacs end
where a blackened red cuff knocks
after a moment the door opens to reveal a smiling mother and father in their sixties
theres a party going on inside a dining table visible beyond them
the mother and fathers smiles disappear
is that you
the santa claus shuffles inside right past them
the santa claus sleepwalks straight for the dining room finding a dozen relatives laughing and eating
a table laden with turkey and stuffing gravy and cranberry wassail and wine
the relatives stop still
the room goes silent
the santa claus sits down at the head of the table
yes its rudy
without a word he stares at the food before him
and takes a plate
he stacks it with meat and dressing and trimmings and sets it in front of him
and digs in
stuffing his face in silence
his mother and father return to the dining room gaping
the other relatives look likewise
all staring at rudy
then while he eats without another sound
the mother takes her seat at the table
and the father pulls up another chair
they touch hands privately and turn back to their plates
theres a clank of silverware a scrape of china a clink of glass and one by one the relatives resume their meals
conversation picks up where it left off smiles return to the table laughter slowly rises in the room
there is mr
duncan and mrs
duncan aunt lisbeth and uncle ray aunt mary and uncle pete toddler sasha and teenage sam brother mike and his girlfriend jill sister stacy and her husband bill grandpa walter
little wendy sue
and at the head of the table
home for christmas
