when you love someone youve gotta trust them
theres no other way
youve got to give them the key to everything thats yours
otherwise whats the point
and for a while
i believed thats the kind of love i had
suddenly the car explodes
flames smoke and metal rise into the sky covering the view of the las vegas casinos and their signs
music in j
bach st matthew passion
aces body comes flying in extreme slow motion
his body twists and turns through the frame like a soul about to tumble into the flames of damnation
vignette of ace through rippling flames we move in on ace rothstein overseeing the casino
he lights a cigarette
before i ever ran a casino or got myself blown up ace rothstein was a hell of a handicapper i can tell you that
i was so good that whenever i bet i could change the odds for every bookmaker in the country
i had it down so cold that i was given paradise on earth
i was given one of the biggest casinos in las vegas to run the tangiers
vignette of mob bosses sitting at a table surrounded by food and wine like the gods of olympus
by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money sixty two million seven hundred thousand dollars
i dont know all the details
matter of fact
vignette of nicky santoro standing at a bar with dominick santoro his brother and frank marino his right hand man
nobody knew all the details but it shoulda been perfect
i mean he had me nicky santoro his best friend watching his ass
vignette of ginger mckenna a dazzling thirty one year old blonde seated by a small fiery pool
and he had ginger the woman he loved on his arm
but in the end
ace looks over the casino he rules
we fucked it all up
it shoulda been so sweet too
but it turned out to be the last time that street guys like us were ever given anything that fuckin valuable again
aerial shot coming down out of the clouds over the brightly lit vegas strip and off into the blackness of the desert night
at that time vegas was a place where millions of suckers flew in every year on their own nickel and left behind about a billion dollars
but at night you couldnt see the desert that surrounds las vegas
aerial shot swooping along the desert floor then rising above the mist to reveal mountains in the distance
but its in the desert where lots of the towns problems are solved
got a lot of holes in the desert and a lot of problems are buried in those holes
except you gotta do it right
i mean you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk
otherwise youre talkin about a half hour or forty five minutes of diggin
and who knows whos gonna be comin along in that time
before you know it you gotta dig a few more holes
you could be there all fuckin night
ace is greeted by a casino exec and walked through the brightly lit entrance to the tangiers casino
who could resist
anywhere else in the country i was a bookie a gambler always lookin over my shoulder hassled by cops day and night
but here im mr sam rothstein
im not only legitimate but running a casino
and thats like selling dreams for cash
we see ace enter alone
he is greeted by billy sherbert
they are joined by top executives richie and ronnie in suits and ties
they walk through the casino past crowded and noisy craps tables spinning roulette wheels blackjack tables poker faced players at poker tables and elegant cordoned off black tie baccarat tables
i hired an old casino pal billy sherbert as my manager and i went to work
introducing the execs to ace and this is ronnie who takes care of the card room
for guys like me las vegas washes away your sins
its a morality car wash
it does for us what lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples
and along with making us legit
dolly back from a wall of money
an employee pours a bucket full of coins into a trough
camera follows progress as numerous coins move on a conveyor system through a sorting machine
camera reveals several rolls of coins on a lower conveyor as they move up a ladder towards an employees hands who then places the rolls on a rack
tons of it
i mean what do you think were doing out here in the middle of the desert
its all this money
this is the end result of all the bright lights and the comped trips of all the champagne and free hotel suites and all the broads and all the booze
its all been arranged just for us to get your money
thats the truth about las vegas
camera follows john nance carrying a small suitcase and walking through the casino to a door leading to the cashiers cage
the sign on the door reads authorized personnel only
he walks through the cage to another door notice keep out
were the only winners
the players dont stand a chance
and their cash flows from the tables to our boxes through the cage and into the most sacred room in the casino
the place where they add up all the money the holy of holies
the count room
he opens the door
we see inside the count room from nances point of view
it looks like the area behind a tellers cage in a bank
a large room windowless decor free
one side is a mesh cage opened to reveal stacks of cash boxes
several counters in white shirts are gathered around a glass table counting and sorting paper money
now this place was off limits
verify two thousand
even i couldnt get inside but it was my job to keep it filled with cash
thats for sure
they had so much fuckin money in there you could build a house out of stacks of bills
and the best part was that upstairs the board of directors didnt know what the fuck was going on
at one end of the room the clerks empty the metal boxes and rapidly count the cash at a counting table
the camera follows a cash drop box being lifted from the stack by a clerk
he pours the cash on to the table and shows the empty box to a video camera
counter rapidly counts the cash and announces five thousand
i mean to them everything looked on the up and up
the first counter recounts the cash
verify five thousand
the guys inside the counting room
stacks of bills lie nearby
the camera pans across the room to another table manned by a count room executive who repeats the figure and writes it down on a master list
we move back to nance opening a cabinet full of stacks of bills
he opens his suitcase and begins to fill it with cash
as he does this the workers studiously look in other directions
were all slipped in there to skim the joint dry
theyd do short counts theyd lose fill slips
theyd even take cash right out of the drop boxes
and it was up to this guy right here nance standin in front of about two million dollars to skim the cash off the top without anybody gettin wise
the irs or anybody
verify two hundred
nance closes the case and walks out
one of the counters dumps another container of money on the table
now notice how in the count room nobody ever seems to see anything
somehow somebodys always lookin the other way
now look at these guys counters
they look busy right
theyre countin money
who wants to bother them
i mean god forbid they should make a mistake and forget to steal
meanwhile youre in and youre out
nance exits the count room and proceeds through the lobby of the casino passing ace and sherbert to a side exit door
past the jag off guard who gets an extra c note a week just to watch the door
i mean its routine
business as usual in out hello goodbye
and thats all there is to it
just another fat fuck walkin out of the casino with a suitcase
now that suitcase was goin straight to one place right to kansas city which was as close to las vegas as the midwest bosses could go without gettin themselves arrested
nance leaves the casino and gets into a cab parked at the curb
he is greeted by artie piscano a gray haired sixty year old underboss
that suitcase was all the bosses ever wanted
and they wanted it every month
hey john how are you
how was your ride
nance with suitcase and piscano leave the car and enter the produce market
now this old mormon fuck here
nance and piscano walk through the grocery store through the warehouse past various employees to a doorway leading into the back room where they are greeted by five older men
around a large wooden table with bowls of macaroni and old jelly glasses filled with red wine
he had to fly in with suitcases once a month nice and easy
somethin smells good
yeah they made us somethin to eat
the bosses would come from all over the place detroit cleveland milwaukee
all over the midwest
and they would meet in the back of this produce market in kansas city
i mean nobody even knew
nance shakes hands with americo capelli sixty eight a bald affable milwaukee entrepreneur and arthur capp his thirty year old yuppie lawyer son
camera continues to pan around the room
one of the guys made his mother do all the cooking
on vincent borelli seventy year old kansas city boss
did you ever see that guy jerry steriano
on vinnie forlano mid seventies an old timer who once drove for capone and is now remo gaggis right hand man
now these old greaseballs might not look it but believe me these are the guys who secretly controlled las vegas
piscano joins his mother and daughter by a stove
that mans here again
piscano dips a piece of bread into a pot of tomato sauce
because they controlled the teamsters union and thats where you had to go if you wanted to borrow money to buy a casino
when youve finished with him i want him
carrying a plate of food to the table where borelli and forlano are seated
here you are gentlemen
and nobody got a teamsters loan unless the guys in this room knew they were gonna get their little suitcases
forlano gets up from the table and walks toward nance
guys like this antique here forlano out of detroit
or especially guys like remo gaggi the outfits top boss
nance embraces remo gaggi whos seated on a couch and sits across from him
you got a round figure on it
definitely the most important guy in this room
picking up the suitcase about twenty pounds
thats around seven hundred thousand
uh huh good
nance opens the case to reveal the money
off screen from following scene i know its a little early for las vegas
camera tilts down a model of the tangiers hotel and casino then reveals the cover of business week magazine with a drawing of philip green a young corporate type smiling
out under the headline philip green vegas wunderkind
but i do want to welcome the ladies and gentlemen of the gaming industry
on andy stone a middle aged man at a podium giving a speech while green seated at a table looks on
photographers flash their cameras
ace and sherbert sitting next to green also watch the photo op ceremony
as far as the world was concerned andy stone the head of the teamsters pension fund was a legitimate guy
this is a very auspicious occasion
a powerful man
philip if you would rise
green stands up
he even played golf with the president
on behalf of the teamsters pension fund it is my pleasure to present to you
but andy also took orders
and when he was told to give a pension fund loan to philip green
handing green a large cardboard facsimile check this check for for the new tangiers
he did what he was told
philip green who is now the head of the tangiers hotel and casino corporation is standing at the podium giving a speech
now here was the perfect front man
i mean what the fuck else could he be
he didnt know too much
he didnt want to know too much especially that the bosses made the teamsters lend him the money
he wanted to believe the teamsters gave him all that fuckin money cause he was smart
an exploding flash bulb fills the screen
i say that knowing full well just how much competition we have in this great city
we see a man and a woman swimming underwater
camera reveals that they are in a motel swimming pool with glass portholes
expensive cars are parked outside one of the rooms
hoods stand around outside the door
and where they got green from who the fuck knows
all i know is that green was an arizona real estate hustler who barely had enough gas money to come and pick up his own fuckin check
we return to the press conference
photographers snap away
in the background are six foot blow ups of the business week cover
the camera moves past green capp and several other men past sherbert to ace
now all they needed was somebody they could trust to run the casino
and who better than ace
i mean he was already in vegas a couple of years and he had the fuckin place clocked
camera looks straight down from the top of a hotel to a large pool area
but typical ace
stone in a bathing suit and robe sits on a lounge chair with a telephone
ace in sports clothes sits on another chair
give him a shot at runnin a casino and he tries to talk you out of it
you know i dont know if i could do this even if i wanted to
the gaming commission would never give me a license
i have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me
you dont have to have a license to work in a casino
all you gotta do is apply for one
the state law says you can work in a casino while theyre processing your application
they got a ten year backlog
but what happens when they do find out
why would they want to find out
were puttin a hundred million into this desert here
why would they want to lock us out
and besides theyll never find out
all you gotta do is keep changing your job title
like uh from casino executive to food and beverage chairman
and what happens it they take your application they put it at the bottom of the pile
i know guys workin there for thirty years dont have a license
exhales its a tough proposition andy
you you know if i did it id have to run it my way
you got it
nobodys gonna interfere with your running the casino
i guarantee it
stone lights a cigarette
ace blows on a die
and thats how that got ace to take over
acess hands place the die into a micrometer
they wanted him because ace ate slept and breathed gambling
camera swish tilts up to ace then swish pans to boxman dealers and players watching him trying to act calm
they worked out a real cute job title too
we see the die in the micrometer
tangiers public relations director
satisfied the die is not loaded ace sets it on the craps table the camera cranes up to reveal the tangiers casino floor
but the only thing he ever directed was the casino
he made his first bet when he was fifteen years old and he always made money
but he didnt bet like you or me
a dealer is sliding chips tossing them on to a craps table
you know havin some fun with it shit like that
approaching the dealer where the hell did you learn how to deal
he reaches down stacking and arranging the chips
he bet like a fuckin brain surgeon
to the chastised place the checks properly
thats the way you do it
he had to know everything this guy
direct overhead tracking shot as ace walks between two rows of gaming tables
hed find out the kind of inside stuff nobody else knew and thats what hed put his money on
ace walks past two boxers sparring in a ring through a doorway into a room where several gamblers are seated around a table
even back home years ago when we were first hangin out together
hed know if the quarterback was on coke
ace is looking at the odds board for college football games
the bookie lucky larry is waiting for ace to hand in his picks
ill take columbia for twenty

as soon as ace bets a man erases a number from the chalkboard and replaces it was a changing the odds
two gamblers saunter from the room
hed get the wind velocity so he could judge the field goals
he even figured out the different bounce you got off the different kinds of wood they used on college basketball courts you know
the two gamblers we saw sauntering out of the bookie joint are racing to the nearest public phones

a bookie hands a stack of money to another bookie who hands the money to ace
ace removes several bills from the top of the stack of winnings and holds them out to the bookies
season after season the prick was the only guaranteed winner i ever knew
but he was so serious about it all that i dont think he ever enjoyed himself
thats just the way he was
the room has an espresso machine and a saints day calendar
assorted hoods are listening to nicky at the bar
camera dollies to remo gaggi at the rear table playing gin rummy with old man capo and losing
every time the capo picks up a card hes able to knock or get gin sending gaggi into a fit bemoaning his bad luck
but back then the bosses didnt give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not
to them he was a cash register
all they had to do was ring the bell and take the money
especially remo who was a fuckin degenerate gambler who always lost
slams down his cards and curses at his losing hands ma che cazzo
italian american slang for what a prick
all those fuckin sweeps
i mean unless ace made his bet
thats enough now
i cant contest the cards
va fa n culo
italian american slang for fuck off summoning a young man
ace made more money for them on a weekend than i could do heisting joints for a month
ace enters and walks to gaggis table
whatever ace picked up on the street he told remo
walks over to ace and whispers hey did you bring that thing
you know i mean fixed fights doped horses crooked fuckin zebras
locked in point spreads
he told fuckin remo everything
and to tell you the truth
i dont blame him
gaggi stands up and shakes aces hand
keepin remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world
gaggi beams as ace takes out an envelope filled with cash and hands it over to him
gaggi sits back down and ace knowing his place smiles and is about to leave

another dealers hands place two chips on a table
ichikawa looks on
but i knew the trick with whales like ichikawa was that they cant bet small for long
he didnt think of it as winning ten thousand he thought of it as losing ninety thousand
ichikawa places a larger bet
so he upped his bets
a dealer picks up some chips from a rack and places them on the table
ichikawa is now seated with stacks of chips in front of him
until he dropped his winnings back and gave up a million of his own cash
ichikawa hours later his chips depleted
ace and sherbert still watch from behind the barrier as millions in chips are back in the dealers racks
in the casino the cardinal rule is to keep them playing
move in on ace as he smokes a cigarette
and keep them coming back
the longer they play the more they lose
in the end we get it all

he hastily kisses ginger and slips out the door
the ginger i knew wouldnt even look at this creep
he was a moocher a card cheat a country club golf hustler
chasing dentists for a few bucks
ginger looks out of the window and sees lester get into a convertible and drive off
i mean the guy was always broke he always had a story
and somehow she could never turn him down
the way ginger saw it i guess was that lester was just an unlucky guy
somebody had to take care of him
nicky his wife jennifer with a beehive hairdo and their eight year old son little nicky are detained while their luggage is searched by a customs agent
but nobody had to take care of nicky
to customs agent you find any cash in there well whack it up with you
i mean he took care of himself only too well
and thats why every badge back home wanted to nail him
to customs agent excuse me but i folded these things beautifully and i would appreciate a little respect
dont look at me pal
i gotta live with her
we see marino waiting for nicky outside the customs area
two cops push past him
even after a little vacation they hassled him at the airport
to marino excuse me
i mean frank marino was there to meet him but so were the cops
this time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in antwerp
will you help me fold these please
they were ready to blame him for anything no matter where it happened
nicky jennifer little nicky and marino walk in
to little nicky you go and put your things away
and they were usually right
nicky jennifer and marino are gathered around the kitchen table
jennifer leans over and starts to shake her hair
whoa whoa whoa
hold it hold it
nicky places a red towel down on the table
jennifer leans over again tugs and shakes her hair until diamonds begin to fall out of her beehive
because nicky enjoyed being a gangster and he didnt give a damn who knew it
there we go
look at that
diamonds fall on the red towel in slow motion
i mean thats what worried me cause it turns out nicky was about to be sent to vegas
all right were clear
i think thats it
theres a couple stuck in there
i know theres more

i couldnt wait to get my hands on vegas

mob bosses forlano capelli gaggi borelli and piscano seated around the back room table eating and talking as in the opening vignette

ace opens the door to nicky and jennifer
nobody interfered with the fuckin skim

from following scene and now
nicky and jennifer stand in the background with other parents listening to a nun school teacher
little nicky and other youngsters are seated at small childrens desks
nicholas santoro will come up and tell us about our first president
stepping up in front of the class to begin a speech george washington was born in a
but still it was nice and quiet for a while
ginger and i presented nicky and jennifer all over town like regular ozzie and harriets
typical virginia farmhouse
nicky and detective bob johnson are coaching their sons
johnson pats little nicky on the back and with encouraging words sends him running on to the field

little nicky hits the ball nicky and detective johnson applaud
and nicky being nicky he made his presence known
nicky saunters through the casino and up to eddy and jerry two well dressed hoods who are signing papers at the cashiers credit window near ace and sherbert
especially at the casino where he definitely did not work people got the message
thats why the bosses sent me out here
they wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint
like these two fuckin balloon heads over here eddy and jerry
they were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin grand

to nicky from behind the cage hey they forgot to sign their papers
they forgot to sign their papers
yeah they dont need those anymore
he looks over to ace and sherbert
out of respect guys from other crews got away with a warning
ace taking a drag off his cigarette nods an okay
everybody else watch out
a blackjack winner who looks like a school teacher with over in chips before him has gathered a crowd
like these yokels here who never heard of nicky or the bosses back home cause theyre the morons who give you the most trouble
even after wed catch em theyd try sneakin back with beards and wigs and fake noses
ace and sherbert walk up to watch the winner who is playing all six hands at the blackjack table
you can spot these assholes by watching the way they bet
like this guy
hes bettin lavender chips at five hundred each with only one little problem
hes always guessed right
if he wasnt so fuckin greedy hed have been tougher to spot
but in the end theyre all greedy
ace walks around the winners table past the crowd to the pit
behind him are more blackjack tables dealers and players
ace bends down and ties his shoelace
i saw that the dealer was weak but he wasnt in on it
the dealers hands lift the corner of his hole card a half an inch to determine the casinos hand against the winner
the slightly exposed hole card is a six of clubs
he just wasnt protecting his hand
he was lifting his hole card way to high
now heres this guy
reading the dealers hole card
and signaling his buddy the winner at this table
we see through his trousers that he is tapping a copper transmitter with a battery pack attached
back at the winners table we see inside his pant leg where a device strapped to his leg is receiving the impulse signal buzz buzz buzz from the signaler
and thats just what these hustlers look for
they cruise from casino to casino lookin for weak dealers the way lions look for weak antelope
ace starts to get up
from following scene operator
ace is on the house phone right near the signalers table
this is mr r
get me armstrong and friday over at pit two right away
he hangs up and fixes his tie in the mirrored panel above the phone
ace waiting lights a cigarette
armstrong joins ace
they look towards the signalers table
to armstrong bj nineteen second base the beard blackjack table number second position man with the beard picks up the phone again
i need mr happy loud
on aces signal waitresses one carrying a cake with a sparkling candle start singing happy birthday attracting the crowds attention
in unison happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
happy birthday dear jeff
happy birthday to you
gamblers cheer and applaud
ace nods and armstrong lets a long metal object drop out from under his jacket sleeve and moves in close behind the signaler as though looking at the game
he presses the object a cattle prod under the signalers arm near his heart
the signaler instantly goes into convulsions falling to the floor gasping and groaning
several security guards grab the signaler as he falls
armstrong walks away
the winner sees what happened to his partner
we got a cardiac arrest here
hes fine folks
just give us some room please
ace watches the scene
the guards lift the stunned signaler to his feet and help him away from the table
play is immediately resumed
watch it now
the winner hurriedly places his chips into racks
they never know what hit them
and if and when
security guards drag the signaler out
they do find out they just got zapped by a cattle prod
sherbert follows the winner as he rushes away
they wish they really did have a heart attack
ace exits behind the guards and the signaler
a grim windowless utility room with tools on racks along the walls some plain wooden chairs and a workbench table
turns out this guy and his fuckin pals they were knockin this place dead for years
hes got a wire on him
the signaler is roughly shoved into the room
a security guard tears his trousers down revealing the signaling device strapped to his leg
hey hey what are you doin man
exposing the device there it is
on the table
the signaler is slammed down face first on the bench and the two guards spread his arms out on the table
in pain oh god
another guard starts up a power saw and approaches the signaler who is now pinned to the table
he starts to scream
ace walks toward the table gesturing for the guard to turn off the saw
we had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over
to relieved signaler im just curious
i saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand
can you do that with both hands
cant do it with both hands
can you do it with your left hand
i never tried
so youre a righty
ace nods to one of the guards
instantly a large rubber mallet smashes onto the mans right hand four times to the sound of screams
now youre gonna have to learn with your left hand
he moans and sits back
from following scene its a hundred
the winner has been standing outside the cashiers cage waiting for his in chips to be cashed
sherbert walks up behind him
a hundred ten
yes it is
thats a lot of money to be counting out in public
to cashier why dont i take him over to the office and verify it huh
a little privacy
and by the way send over a
nice bottle of champagne on ice huh
by the way
im billy sherbert your casino manager
he shakes hands with the winner
having a good time
sherbert leads him away from the cage
youll want to count the money in privacy
you know you dont need
uh i have a plane to catch to cleveland
can i get my winnings
the winner is pushed through the door by two guards followed by sherbert and sees his pal moaning in pain and holding his broken hand
look what they did to my hand man
walks over to the all right im gonna give you a choice
you can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here
you cant have both
what do you want
sherbert stands next to the winner i just wanna get out of here
and dont forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here
i made a bad mistake
youre fuckin right you made a bad mistake
cause if you come back here we catch either one of you were gonna break your fuckin heads and you wont walk out of here
you see that fuckin saw

you dont fuck around in this place
you got it
get out of here
the guards usher the winner out of the room
to the guards referring to the throw him out in the alley
and just tell the cops he got hit by a car
ace and ginger are alone in the living room
the apartment looks out on the glittering neon signs of the strip
within no time everything was set in place
we got rid of the freelance scamsters
the per was way up
the gods were happy or as happy as the gods can ever be
and i i decided to complicate my life
for a guy who likes sure things i was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot

that can grow as i as long as theres a mutual respect
that kind of thing can grow
i can accept that
but you know what is
what is love anyway
its a mutual respect
its its a devotion

i feel that eventually you would care enough about me
that i could live with that
if it doesnt work out

she looks at him
ace is holding her hand tightly
ace and ginger are seated at a banquet table with various guests drinking champagne
amy their six month old child is in a cradle
nicky and jennifer are hovering around the baby with little nicky and are blissfully happy
it is an elegant affair
city officials politicians and gaming officials are there plus sherbert and aces boss philip green
a photographer takes pictures of the guests
when i married ginger i knew all the stories but i didnt give a fuck
im sam rothstein i said

it was typical ace
he invited the biggest people in town and he knew theyd show
because he knew they all wanted somethin from him
with ace nobody ever got a free ride
with her we see amy in the cradle
he still covered his bets
they had to have the baby first before they got married
even made jennie and me watch amy for a few days when they went on their honeymoon
but i didnt mind we loved the kid
lesters and gingers telephone conversation is heard in voice over this scene
over telephone can you feel my eyes on you
can you feel me look into your heart

can you feel me in you
in your heart
we see a wide view of the elaborate wedding guests mill about the banquet hall

i think i have a right to do that
its all right
that part of your life is over with
youre with me now
they are reflected in a mirror behind the telephone
want to go
lets go back in
aces hands pick up a white rose and gingers gloves from the desk
ace and ginger drive up to an expensive house which backs on to a country club golf course
ace takes ginger inside
it is fancy and lush
through sliding glass doors we see a patio and a pool area
sighing its great
the living room has exposed white brick along the walls bronze ostrich figurines a white baby grand piano and a zebra print rug surrounded by a few couches
oh its great
ace takes ginger past the bedroom to their huge room sized closet
there are racks and racks of clothes
running into the closet oh
its all my stuff
oh my god
ace presents her with a long chinchilla coat
you brought all my stuff
i can she sees the coat
try it on
he puts it on her
whispering youre kidding
what is it
looking at herself in the mirror oh its so soft
its nice isnt it
ace kisses her
no ones ever been so nice to me
they kiss and embrace
aces hand opens a leather case full of gold bvlgari jewelry
gasps oh my god
ace and ginger lie on the bed surrounded by jewelry
ginger is swathed in the chinchilla coat
ace watches as a transfixed ginger tries on gold necklaces rings bracelets and earrings
so do you think its too much if i wear these in the same day
you do whatever you want
do i keep my promises or do i keep my promises
ace kisses ginger
youre so wonderful
the jewelrys not so bad either
the only thing is
you shouldnt keep this in the house
we gotta put it in a bank
putting on a gold bracelet come on
can i keep this one in the house
now look gently holding her face gathering her total attention pay attention to me
what im gonna tell you is very important
all this stuff doesnt mean anything
money this doesnt mean anything without trust
i have to be able to trust you with my life
ace and ginger get off the tangiers jet carrying two suitcases
ace gives a chauffeur the luggage and follows ginger into a brown rolls royce
with over a million in cash and jewels tucked in a bank in vegas only for ginger she was secure and happy
ace and ginger walk into the bank lobby carrying the suitcases
she loved that shit
but a guy in my line of work has to have a lot of pay off cash around
there are several safe deposit boxes filled with cash
ace and ginger are closing a large box so crammed with cash that ace has to lean on it for the clasp to lock
crooked cops and kidnappers they dont take checks
need a little help with that mr collins
so i put two million in cash in a los angeles bank under the name of mr and mrs tom collins
this was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money
ace and ginger struggle to push the crammed box into a slot in the wall
and since id either be in jail or locked in a closet when i needed the money the most
the bank president joins them and he and ace simultaneously double lock the outer safe box door with two separate keys after which ace gives ginger his key
i gave ginger the only key to the cash that could get me back alive
ginger is on the other side of a glass wall signing papers
now this is just a signature card
so once she signs those papers shell be the only person to have total access to the box
no one else including myself
we see ginger looking at ace
thats the way you wanted it right
ace nods quietly
sam let me ask you a question
you must really trust your wife
quietly yeah sure i do
no tha thats good
its just unusual
to tell you the truth so many of my clients dont
ace looks over to ginger smiles and winks
she looks back at him
jerry vale sings to a seated audience
ace sits alone at a table
with ginger and the money in place i felt covered and to play it safe i switched job titles again and made myself um food and beverage director
this way nobody would bother me about a license
i mean vegas was like a dream for me
nicky is seated at another table with marino peeling off money and giving it to mike a crooked dealer
nicky was dreamin his own kind of vegas
to begin i put money out on the streets chargin three points a week

mike gets up from the table
they were degenerate gamblers coke freaks
in no time i had half the dealers in the tangiers in my pocket
nicky is at a table with his gang of card sharks slim rocky moosh and cowboy all secretly signaling each other sandbagging a mark
mike the crooked dealer from the previous scene deals nicky a winning hand

signaling back and forth
i bet thirty five hundred
nicky wiggles a toothpick back and forth in his mouth
ive been losing for three days straight non stop
another shark pulls on his ear
oh whyre you crying with three loaves of bread under your arm
ace watches their signals with concern
nicky thought nobody was watching him
but he was wrong
we see two undercover gaming agents looking like tourists sneaking looks at nickys table
and i didnt want any of those agents near my place
four aces doc
his hands spread five cards on the table showing four aces
what do you got
getting up in disgust jesus christ

nicky looks over at the gaming agents
ace was so fuckin worried about his casino he forgot what we were doin out here in the first place
security people are pulling apart a husband and wife who are fighting

a tiger leaps towards the camera which pans over to two showgirls and then to aces hand holding the key to a rolls royce
he gives it to jonathan and david as reporters rush in to photograph the moment
you know ace could be a very touchy guy especially when he got bigger and bigger in town
like when he hired that jonathon and david and their tigers away from the palace by buildin them a new stage and then givin them a silver rolls royce
ace and sherbert watch as a stage manager weighs in the femme fatale showgirls
but ill tell you he knew how to bring in the crowds
he knew all the fuckin angles
he brought over the whole femme fatale show from paris
but he forgot how lazy them european dancin broads can get
i mean he had to weigh em in once a week to make sure they didnt blow up like fuckin balloons
to showgirl youre still eight pounds over
whats the reason for this
mr rothstein sir let me put her on suspension
never mind the sir
never mind the sir
well sir i was just
why is she eight pounds over
trying to offer you the respect that your
mr rothstein is good enough
well sometimes when you reach that pressure point when you put that pressure point on them you know it shows
she could at least lose half a pound or a quarter
and she doesnt always all you do is give me answers
just just give me the right answer
well i dont know why
i guess maybe because shes frightened that if she doesnt lose the weight she may even get fired
she will get fired
in fact i want you to send her back to paris
its always been our policy no
just stop everything
sherbert and ace walk away across a huge stage
to ace this womans an institution
i dont care what she is
shes an institution thats the problem
ace standing in a large space surrounded by giant tv screens showing sports events
around him long rows of bettors are seated at betting stations lined up at windows or wandering around at the bar

from inside the diner what the fuck is that supposed to mean
ace and nicky are seated at a table in the empty diner
reading from a document
detrimental to gaming

and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up
he waves the document

to get one of those sandwiches i like
you cant even set foot in the parking lot
thats how serious it is

from inside the van into a walkie talkie cars comin
we move past the van to a larger truck parked in an alley
unseen the truck has an open side door abutting the jewelry stores wall
sal fusco and bernie blue are inside the truck drilling into the wall using a heavy duty battery powered drill
the drill is muffled with sheets of insulation material
they were always very careful
and they always bypassed the alarms or else
if not theyd drill enough holes to knock through the walls with a sledgehammer
blue widens the hole with a hammer muffled with insulation
a flashbulb explodes
cops and detectives are photographing and inspecting holes drilled in the wall of the shop through which the thieves have come and gone
the camera moves in through the hole
nobody out there was expecting a guy like him
the stunned store owner looks at the rubble and the empty jewelry boxes
detectives collect evidence
for nicky las vegas was the fuckin wild west
leading a detective to his showroom i just got a shipment of diamonds from israel
but what the fuck they expect from me
i had to earn didnt i
marino stands above two iranians who are looking at the stolen gems
you know this diamond has flaws in it
no no theres no flaws in it
dont tell me
im doing this for twenty five years
you better clean your fuckin loupe
cause theres no flaws in these diamonds
the two iranians speak to each other in farsi
whenever we got local merch wed usually send it to palm spring or arizona
i had a couple of sand niggers out there
you know arabs
what are you gonna have a fuckin meeting here or are you gonna buy some diamonds
chuckling no no
i know his language
im talking with him
forty thousand dollars you can buy the whole package
twenty thousand and thats my final offer and
to iranian all of a sudden he talks english now
lets talk turkey here how bout twenty five thousand
nicky and marino sneak into the house past jennifer who is asleep on the sofa in front of a tv set
nicky takes out a key and opens the metal door into his bedroom
i actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where i kept the choice stuff
referring to jennifer as they pass the kitchen she asleep
every night on the couch
i couldnt leave it at the gold rush in case we got raided by the cops
or if my crew got cute
opening the metal door to his bedroom
i had the only key
camera pans across bedroom to closet door
jennifer didnt give a fuck
she used to fall asleep on the couch watchin television every night
this stuff was all mine
i didnt send any of this back home
nicky opens the closet door
he and marino walk in and bend down to lift up a small square of carpet to reveal a floor safe
actually i couldnt because i wasnt even supposed to be doin it
the bosses were makin so much fuckin money with the casinos unlocking the safe that they didnt want anybody makin any waves for them
in the floor safe there are several handguns and silencers
frank hands nicky a roll of money
give all the guys in your crew a piece of that
i took care of everybody
he searches marinos jacket
thats why there was no real organized street stuff in vegas before i came here
nicky throws the cash in the safe and closes the lid
nicky is being shown papers by charlie clark a heavy set banker with a moustache
theyre both seated at a table in the living room
yeah that works out
but how much cash could i bury in my closet right
you need to understand and i im sure you do
that in a venture of this kind you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss
oh listen i understand that theres always a risk
you know i might have to take a loss somewhere
so i put some of the money into legitimate deals with charlie clark
he was aces banker
i mean you will try to push it through wont you mr clark
well you gotta understand im giving you fifty thousand cash
charlie clark chuckles then i put some more of the money
a prosciutto sandwich is being prepared on a kitchen counter
in some legitimate places like my restaurant
to cook preparing sandwich is that the last one
he hands the sandwich to dominick who spits in it
i had my kid brother dominick run it for me
dominick wraps it in plastic and puts it into a brown paper bag
dominick sets the bag with the wrapped sandwich in it on top of pizza boxes being held by two uniformed vegas cops
here you go guys
thanks a lot
he shakes cop s hand before heading back into the restaurant

muttering to himself
choke on it ya motherfucker
passing dominick on his way out hey dom

nicky enters kissing his brother

nicky sends his warmest regards
marino unzips a small sack and hands gaggi a thick stack of cash
gaggi inspects it before handing it over to one of his men

walking over to him smiling
towering over nicky holding a drink in one hand and his shoulder in the other she leans down and kisses him

nicky takes the drink out of her hand
and take it easy with this shit will you
i mean this can only make matters worse

she begins to cry

she kisses him
tenderly strokes his head thanks
she embraces nicky wrapping her arms around him
through tears thank you
feeling a little awkward with the hug its all right
she kisses him again
nicky doesnt move holding back
pull back from a sign with a tiny yes on top of a gigantic no leaning on a window overlooking the sportsbook
we see ace behind his desk taking a swig of mylanta
his secretary telephones
we see past pat webbs cowboy hat down onto aces secretary on the phone
into telephone mr rothstein
county commissioner pat webb is here to see you
over telephone okay
into telephone give me a minute
over telephone okay
ace hangs up the phone
to webb itll just be a minute
ace gets up from his desk and we see he is in his boxer shorts
he opens the closet and carefully puts on the trousers hanging inside
a very patient webb is leaning against some double doors across from aces secretary
can i get you anything
cordially tipping his hat
no thank you little lady
into telephone okay send him in and call me four minutes after
webb walks in
he is big tough and western wearing a stetson tooled boots jeans an elbow patched jacket and a turquoise bear claw string tie
his headband contains a rattlesnake head
aces secretary shuts the door on her way out
with hand outstretched to ace
im pat webb
how do you do
they shake hands
hey it is my pleasure
yeah i heard a lot about you
oh thank you sir
looking out aces office picture window overlooking the sportsbook
hey house is doin well
hey all that money is rollin in
i appreciate you takin the time to see a poor ol civil servant
no thats quite all right
why dont you have a seat
thank you sir
webb sits down in a chair in front of aces desk
uh i come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter
see uh maybe you didnt know it but uh don ward is a very well liked man in this town
hes got lots of friends here
now his family and their money go back many many years
now friends vote
family and money votes
thats important to me
and if youll think about our little problem along them lines
and you forgive me for sayin it maybe he did not deserve to be fired
im sorry but he knew about our gettin hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it
that means either he was in on it or forgive me for saying this he was too dumb to see what was going on
either way i cannot have a man like that workin here
before we point the dirty end of the stick at ol don uh we better be sure we can prove them charges
believe me if i could prove it he would be under arrest
are uh clears throat
are we certain that you want the gamin control board eyeballin your record and your gangster pals like nicky santoro
i think youre way out of line talkin to me like that
what youre sayin is libelous and youre in no position to challenge my expertise
i went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid
hes weak hes incompetent
he jeopardizes the whole place
theres not much more i can do for him
chuckling you have got me there
old don is as useless as tits on a boar
but he is my brother in law and i would look on it as a personal favor if youd think some more on hirin him back
i cant do that
and i appreciate the fact that hes your brother in law and i do want to help you and i like to do favors and i know who you are
but i cannot do that
well could there be any position
further down the trough
pause im sorry i cant do anything
hes too incompetent
and the bottom line is he cannot be trusted

move in on a door that reads notice no admittance caution hearing protection must be worn in this area
nance opens it with a key to reveal the hard count room
coins tumble of a conveyor belt
no matter what the problems were outside the count room it was all worth it
the cash kept rollin in
nance dumping two large suitcases in the trunk of a car
suitcases kept comin and goin
and let me tell ya the fuckin bottom line here is
the trunk lid is shut
the counters sort through a pile of cash on a table
the camera moves on one counter as he pockets some cash
the only problem was that after a while the bosses noticed that the suitcases were gettin a little light
nance is seated at a table eating with forlano capelli capp borelli piscano and gaggi

nance enters through a door and walks past a man picking up a bucket of coins and dumping them into a trough
a clerk seated at a coin weighing scale places a ticket into a small tray
nance reads the printout of the machine
even john nance thats the guy who ran the skim he knew there wasnt much you could do about it
you gotta know that a guy who helps you steal even if you take care of him real well i mean hes gonna steal a little bit extra for himself
makes sense dont it
well you go try and make these hard headed old greaseballs understand that
whats the point of skimming if were being skimmed
defeats the whole purpose of what were doin out there
to nance huh
you know they take this money because theyre my guys
so you gotta give em some leeway
but the bosses never believed in leeway so listen to what they do they
borelli is talking to piscano his underboss
put artie piscano the underboss of kc in charge of making sure nobody skimmed the skim
what the hell have you been doin out there
i was out there with my cumma italian american slang for girlfriend

the only trouble was piscano was a disaster
this guy could fuck up a cup of coffee

gaggi holding a cigarette snaps his fingers in disgust grunts and slams down the phone
he men watch in silence
curly takes the phone away
she was doin pretty good with her lawsuit but before she could start countin her money the boys back home decided to settle the case out of court instead
scott alone is sitting at her kitchen table
so they send me
nicky swiftly enters the room grabs scott around the neck and fires three shots into her head
he leans scott back against the chair then gently while stroking her hair sets her head to the side
blood flows from her mouth on to her pink robe
nicky grabs his gun and leaves
reporters are heard shouting mr green
green gets off the tangiers corporate jet and is assaulted by questions about the scott murder
green is stunned

these guys back home dont give a fuck about the supreme court and any of this bullshit
they want things to quiet down
they want you to walk away from walk away
andy you cant be serious

every time they mention my name in the papers these cocksuckers they mention nicky too
how the fuck does that help
i mean the heat he brought down is murder
we had a police department who was cooperative
hes pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore
i mean what do you do about that
what do you propose
i dont know he doesnt listen to me
maybe he should
get lost for a while
take a vacation
would that be so bad
they aint sendin nicky nowhere
all right look if he took a break it would just give everybody some time to maneuver
thats all im saying
its all that im saying
i would forget about the maneuver
i would just get out
sighs i cant do that
jennifer is on the phone with ginger nicky listens in

nicky started out before me because it wasnt that easy
for him to get around anymore
into radio okay pulled out

hes headed upstream
nicky couldnt even go for a ride without changing
cars at least six times before he could shake all his tails
nickys car with marino driving pulls in nicky jumps out and gets in another car
and because of all the planes he had to use underground garages
marino drives off
nickys second car screeches in to another garage
nicky hurries across the lot to another car
nicky changes cars again
nicky is running to yet another car
he drives off
a solitary ace waiting in the vast desert looking around
ace looks at a sage brush and sand and a few rocks on the desert floor
this could be a hole meant for him
he steps away from it
meeting in the middle of the desert always made me nervous
its a scary place
i knew about the holes in the desert of course and everywhere i looked there could have been a hole
aerial shot of nicky driving
normally my prospects of comin back alive from a meeting with nicky were ninety nine out of a hundred
but this time when i heard him say a couple a hundred yards down the road i gave myself fifty fifty
ace still standing in the desert
nickys car suddenly appears as a reflection in aces sunglasses shaking ace out of his desert induced reverie
nickys car pulls up by ace
he gets out and storms up to him

seated across from ginger at a booth first of all hes not gonna wear f thousand dollar suits
but lets say he did which he wont
how you gonna get fitted for twenty five suits in three days
i um i mean how could you get fitted that fast
i cant get fitted that fast and i pay twice as much
i bought him a watch too
but even if you bought him a watch a really nice watch one that he thought was nice and he doesnt know what the fuck a good watch is so
you go five ten twelve grand
at the most which is impossible for him
she glances to the table behind them
plus at the most three suits a thousand apiece
that still leaves what
around ten thousand
staring down at her plate trying to restrain herself would you knock it off sam
im just tryin to figure it out
theres nothin to figure out
were workin it out
she lights a cigarette
yeah but ive been told that before were workin it out
you think that youre home
after what you just put me through with amy is a favor to me
she looks at ace
pause so counting the watch lets say another four thousand for expenses over the weekend
of which you must have had a good time
i know he did
thats for sure
i know that
fuckin piece of shit had a good fuckin time
on my money
you might as well have fucked him which you probably did anyway
ginger glares at him
youre lookin at me a certain way

that fuckin pimp cocksucker
hes lucky i didnt kill him last time
lucky hes fuckin livin
and if you wouldve stayed with amy
and you wouldve ran away
you wouldve been fuckin dead
ginger scoots out of the booth and leaves
both of you
wide overhead of ace alone in bed
off screen we hear ginger a little drunk on the phone
whispering into telephone i cannot do it anymore
i cant fuckin live like this
its not right
aces point of view as he moves towards the sound of gingers voice
he enters frame and stops to listen
what are you
yes of course he doesnt come home at night
what is the big fuckin deal

that wasnt the deal
he acts like
like im the only one around here with a fuckin past
hell never let me live it down
well i mean i tried

ace slips into the foyer where he can see gingers reflection in a glass door as she talks on the phone in the living room
whispering into telephone i want to have him killed
yes i want him killed
ive fuckin had it
ginger is on the phone
into telephone so are you with me on this
ace steps up behind her
she gasps still holding the phone

he hears nothing and throws the phone down near her
ginger rises and attacks ace
i fuckin hate you

he pushes her against the closet wall and throws an overnight bag at her

ginger squats down and starts to gather her stuff
the arrangement is over

you cant just put me in the street
ill get your cash
you havent been straight with me ever since i met you

ace walks past her to his side of the large walk in closet
racks and racks of her clothes are still hanging
she tosses a pair of red shoes at him
how could i love you
how can i love you
you treat me like im your fucking dog
ace leans down and opens a shoe box filled with money
he grabs as much cash as he can hold
youre lower than a dog
he walks up to her
shoving the bundles of cash in her face here
is this enough money
will it last you two fuckin days

stuffing the money in her bag

she puts on a white fur coat

she bends down to pick up her bag but ace insists on carrying it
i guarantee you i will not stop you
ginger and ace walk through their bedroom to the front door
hes carrying her suitcase

sniffs walking back

he opens the door and tosses her suitcase out
i am not

he shoves her out the door
send my lawyers a letter
slamming the door behind her
god fuckin damn you
he locks the door and peers through the peep hole
through the doors as ace walks away youre not getting away with this
youre not gonna fuck me out of my end
ginger is furious
she picks up the suitcase and walks up to her sportscar
she drives off
ace is lying awake in bed smoking a cigarette watching the casinos eye in the sky surveillance monitors
he hears a car turn into his driveway
he sees the cars headlight beams the funny thing was that after all that
i didnt want her to go
she was the mother of my kid
i loved her
i realized i didnt want to give her the money because if i did
i knew id never see her again
ace reaches over to take gingers hand she slowly takes hold of his
ginger is getting amy ready for school
ace enters as amy is on her way out
he holds her face in his hands and kisses her
have a good day at school
ace walks over to ginger who turns sullenly to look at him
from now on i have to know where you and amy are at all times
he takes a beeper out of his coat pocket and holds it up to gently now heres a beeper
i want you to keep it on you
its very light
so i can call you whenever i have to
ginger reluctantly takes the beeper
she nods silently
he looks at her and turns leaving her alone in the kitchen
a very large trailer is in the middle of an empty construction site
gingers and nickys cars are parked outside
from trailer well what are you supposed to do
i mean what do you want to do
do you want to stay the way you are
you want to stay like this
you cant do that
ginger and nicky are alone in the large trailer
they are sitting close together on a couch
i mean listen two people dont get along at some point you gotta call it
i mean its none of my business but i
i think thats what you gotta do
you gotta take it somewhere smoking a cigarette oh youre right i know
well i was just what

pauses let me think about that

he holds that key so tight hes probably got it stuck up his ass
chuckles yeah right

i could have buried him
i could have gone to europe and taken the baby
and then hedve tracked me down and hedve killed me

i mean seriously
she cuddles closer to him
well theres one thing you dont do

nicky embraces her
i like that

playing with his jacket i did what you told me to

cause you always tell me the right thing to do
pause with his arm around her

everything went to his head
he sighs rubbing her neck
in unison changed
he aint the same person right
whispering no hes not
he really thinks who the fuck he is ill tell you that
holding back tears exactly
he hates me
she rests her head on nickys shoulder starting to weep
he hates my fuckin guts
come on come on youre a toughie

runs his hand down her cheek
crying im not as tough as you think i am
yes you are
sobbing im not and he scares the shit out of me
i never know what hes gonna do
whispering come on

softly through tears i need some help

gingers sobs subside a little and her hand starts to stroke nickys neck
whispering i do

whispering nicky please
yes i will
its what you want isnt it
sobbing thank you
yeah yeah yeah

uh huh nicky interrupts and kisses her
she kisses him back
he pushes her head down to his lap
nicky opens the door to the trailer and peers out to make sure no one is watching
we see past a chain link fence to a camper
we hear the sound of photos being taken with a high speed camera
we see ginger and nicky slip out of the trailer in the deserted work site
you see that
fbi men with long lens cameras are recording the event on film
thats aces wife
still photos nicky and ginger steal a kiss
still photos click
ginger and nicky embrace
the agents watch as ginger and nicky move towards their separate cars
this is great for the boss
ginger gets into her car
still photos click ginger getting into her car
click nicky getting into his car
nicky and ginger drive off
ace is waiting for ginger
he hears a car pull into the drive way he gets up and looks out the sliding glass door
he sits back down motionless with a glass of milk
she walks in with a sack of groceries and some dry cleaning
she puts her purse and the groceries down on the kitchen counter and hangs up the dry cleaning
you didnt answer your beeper
i threw it away
you threw it away
as she puts some items away look i tried to do this thing
i know that you want me to but its just you know im driving down the freeway and the fuckin things beep beep beep beep
you know im in a restaurant and its its embarrassing
i dont want to do it anymore
i put her to bed
walking away towards their bedroom

ginger sets some items down on her dressing table in front of a mirror
oscar wants you to call him

ginger is on the hall phone dialing
we hear a phone ring through the earpiece
she waits a few seconds and hangs up
the lines busy
theres nobody there
she starts to walk away
ace stops her picks up the phone and dials
we hear jennifer answer
over telephone hello
into telephone hello jennifer its sam all right
i didnt have lunch with jennifer

quietly i was with somebody
i know you were with somebody
who was it
i just hope its not someone who i think it might be
sighs then whispers i just hope its not them
quietly i knew she fucked around
the two of them are seated separately
ginger is on the floor leaning against a chair crying softly
she did what she did and i did what i had to do
but jesus nicky was the worst thing she couldve done
what if he wont stop
i mean it could get us both killed
i can back him off
she was very convincing
a neon signs reads la concha motel
when she wanted to be
this is how she backed him off
ginger and nicky are making love on the bed panting grunting and gasping
they have finished making love
nicky is zipping up his pants
ginger still sits on the bed smoking a cigarette
dont forget if youre challenged you know if he asks anything deny everything
he walks up to her
do you understand
i dont want him bringin beefs back home
cause that could be a problem
you gotta be careful
hes not dumb you know
you hear what im sayin right
her arm and thigh are bruised
you dont have to tell me that
what do you think chuckling im stupid
she takes a drag off her cigarette
do i think youre stupid
no i think youre beautiful
he bends down and kisses her
but i gotta go
a car moves into the station and stops at a gas pump
time nicky had things so fucked up on the streets that every time marino went back home the
slow motion of marino walking through the front office past a few men
he tosses his cigarette butt and puts it out with his shoe
he looks nervous
packages got smaller and smaller
marino takes a small stack of cash out of his coat
a seated gaggi nods for one of his men to take the money
to the point when he walked into the place
he didnt know whether he was gonna be kissed or killed
gaggis man takes the money
frankie i want to ask you something
but i want you to tell me the truth
of course remo
i want you to tell me the truth mind you

pats marinos hand
gaggi drinks from his espresso cup
so does marino looking over cautiously at the old man
by now nicky and his crew had already hit rock bottom
i mean vegas really got to him
nicky is punching a man who is leaning against a car
they are surrounded by marino fusco blue and hardy
the man remains erect
the booze the coke the broads
i mean he got sloppy
he just wasnt the same nicky anymore
dominick takes over
exhausted nicky walks to his car and leans on the open car door
to nicky you must have drunk too much

i heard one night he had to belt a guy three times before he finally went down
dominick finally knocks the man down
in the old days nicky wouldve decked him with one shot
you add this into the mix
maybe vegas just got
nicky and his crew get into their cars
to all of us
and his crew followed him right over the edge
the man is left alone on the ground of the dingy parking lot
they were all tuned up half the time on coke
i mean they started doin
blue gets out of his car with an aluminium foil package to confront the police
watch it partner watch it
the worst was blue
belligerent hey what do you guys want out of my life huh
stay in the fuckin car
he never knew when to keep his fuckin mouth shut
he has a gun
drop your gun or ill
hey fuck you
drop the gun
blue is shot several times by both cops
he falls on the ground dead
the cops shot him
they shot blue
blue is yelling back at the cops holding the foil package
because they thought his hero sandwich was a gun
freeze frame as the camera moves in on the wrapped sandwich in his hand
you know they could have
the cops walk up to blue who is on the ground amid shattered glass
been right but who knows

and to make matters worse to get even nickys crew got stoned one night and they started shootin up the cops houses
cop plants a gun on the ground next to blues legs using a handkerchief to avoid leaving fingerprints
the house explodes as gunfire riddles the front of a detectives home
marino dominick fusco hardy and three hoods in another car are spraying the home with machine guns and shotguns
nicky and marino emerge from the shop
i mean it got to the point where they couldnt even talk in the gold rush anymore because the feds put a wire in the wall
two fbi agents with binoculars are watching nicky and marino trying to read their lips
and even when they talked outside they had to cover their mouths because
lowering his binoculars jeez hes coverin up again
he raises the binoculars and looks through again
the feds brought in lip readers
nicky and marino are outside talking
they are covering their mouths with their hands and constantly looking around
nicky found out about it from a teller who owed him money
this guy worked
voice over trails off
he asked me again about you and the jews wife

he puts his head in his hands
we see sherbert approach the sliding glass door holding a shotgun
ace lets him in locks the door and grabs the gun from him
through the sliding patio doors we see ace and sherbert making sure all the doors are locked and the lights are turned off

ace leads sherbert to the front door as he stuffs a shoebox filled with cash and jewels in a bag and hands it over to him
hotel safe then i want you to come right back
ace shuts the down behind him and switches off a light
the room goes black
a crisp sunny morning
sherberts car is parked on the street in front of the house
an exhausted ace in his robe and sherbert are seated across from each other at the bar with the shotgun displayed prominently on the counter between them
camera pans with gingers car as it approaches the driveway and crashes into the back of aces parked car
ace and sherbert react to the noise
sherbert grabs the shotgun
ace looks out the window at ginger ramming her car into his
she shes alone

twelve fbi agents with rifles wearing fbi armbands charge into the parking lot and rush through the front door
began to tumble

between piscano complaining on a wire
the fbi agents escort dominick hardy fusco and marino out of the front of the shop

duprey sifts through the count room executives notebook
austin is at a cabinet looking through a ledger

she continues to scream as the agents try to revive him

an fbi agent gives him mouth to mouth
he got so upset he had a heart attack and dropped dead right there in front of his wife
fbi agents and restrain piscanos hysterical wife

we cant help him if ace opens his front door and is confronted by two fbi agents
he is shown pictures of nicky and ginger at the construction site
quietly and at the end of the day they finally came to see me with the pictures
pointing to the pictures why protect a friend who betrayed you like that
but i didnt want to look at em
i didnt want to look at the guys who brought em either
ace refuses to look at the photos and quietly closes the door on the agents
gaggi forlano borelli and capelli are all in court
forlano and capelli are breathing through masks and oxygen tanks with nearby doctors and nurses
gaggi has a cane in front of him
several court spectators look on
we hear the bosses lawyer speak
your honor as you can see my clients are elderly and infirm
any incarceration could pose a serious health risk
they are no danger to the community and they pose no flight risk
when the bosses were arrested some of em were so old they needed doctors at their arraignment
and pre trial services recommends that bail remain as presently set
calling a recess were going to take a ten minute recess
the judge pounds his gavel
and when it looked like they could get twenty five years
the bosses their nurses and lawyer file through a side court door
to life in prison just for skimmin a casino
sick or no fuckin sick you knew people were gonna get clipped
so the day of the arraignment they had this meeting right in the back of the court house
the bosses are gathered around a conference table as the lawyers and nurses silently walk out the door as if on cue
see when something like this happens you know how things are gonna work out
its always better with no witnesses
so what about andy
putting down his oxygen mask once the door behind him is shut he wont talk
stone is a good kid
stand up guy just like his old man
thats the way i see it
a fuckin marine
holding his oxygen mask hes okay
he always was
remo what do you think
why take a chance
at least thats the way i feel about it
andy stone and his lawyer are walking toward their car
you call artie
and you tell him i dont care what hes gotta be in my office thursday morning before eleven oclock
his lawyer veers to the left walking away from stone who keeps talking
to himself its terribly important
i gotta have a conversation with this guy
gaggis men curly and beeper appear from behind stone and shoot him dead
they empty their silent half load rounds into stone even after hes down on the snowy ground
they walk away discreetly leaving him partially hidden between cars
as much as they liked him i mean he wasnt one of us
he wasnt italian
as far as they knew he could have talked
otherwise stony might still be alive
the camera moves down a waterfall to reveal nances spanish style house
the first one to skip was john nance
he found a nice warm secluded place in costa rica
he thought nobody would find him there
several gunshots are heard
nance emerges from the house through a door and runs along a verandah to another door
he breaks a pane of glass unlocks another door and runs in
beeper emerges from the first door and follows him back into the house
several more shots are heard
nance emerges from yet another door only this time hes been shot in the stomach
he painfully staggers away from the hitmen
but then his kid got nabbed by the feds for drugs and so naturally the bosses were afraid hed come out of hidin just to save his kid and give
em all up
curly and beeper come out of the house and approach nance from behind
hey where you goin jag off
nance kneels down
curly points his gun expertly at the top of nances head and fires
blood splatters from nances mouth and he falls to the ground
the gunmen walk away
but anyway they you know they all had to follow
a bound count room exec and a clerk are kneeling next to a large pit in the esert ground in front of beeper and curly
everybody went down
the clerk groans as hes shot in the head by beeper
blood splatters and he falls right into the pre dug hole
go ahead fuck
curly shoots the exec in the head he too falls backward into the pit
the gunmen fire more rounds into the bodies then toss their guns into the hole
before you knew it
richie a sharply dressed tangiers exec is getting into his new lincoln
anybody who knew anything wound up gettin whacked
curly sneaks up from behind and hits the exec with a lead pipe
he puts a plastic bag over his head and begins to choke him to death
the exec struggles a bit but the bag soon fills with blood
curly strikes him with the pipe one last time
the camera pans away from an empty registration desk to a motel corridor
the camera moves past several rooms along a cinder block wall
after ginger took off she wasnt much help to anybody
she found some pimps low lifes druggies and bikers in la
and in a few months they went through all the money and all the jewels
suddenly a door opens and ginger overdosing staggers into the hall looking for help
she gasps goes halfway down the seedy corridor towards the desk but collapses and dies
after they found her body
i had a private doctor do another autopsy
he said they gave her
a hot dose
in the end
all she had left was thirty six hundred in mint condition coins
ace emerges from the restaurant smoking a cigarette as in the first scene in the film
he gets into his car to start the ignition
no matter what the feds or the papers might have said about my car bombing
flames surge from the windshield concealing ace behind the wheel
the sign above him reads tony romas a place for ribs
ace is leaving the restaurant and walking to his car
it was amateur night and you could tell
whoever it was they put the dynamite under the passenger side
but what they didnt know what nobody outside the factory knew was that that model car was made with a metal plate under the drivers seat
its the only thing that saved my life
ace opens his car door and gets in
ace turns on the ignition and we see two and three inch flames come out of the defroster vents
everything goes silent as he is suddenly engulfed in flames
the car explodes in flames two storeys high
the screen fills with the rising explosion of smoke and fire
the bombing was never authorized but i suspect i know who lit the fuse

marino swings at him with two bats as hes taken away into the cornfield
dominick is battered and bloody
marino hardy and beeper stand over him still swinging their bats
nicky is on his side still held down by sally and fusco
his face is a little bloody
whimpering as they beat dominick dominick
pleading for his brothers life
frankie leave the kid alone

marino swings two final blows to dominicks head
nicky looks away sobbing
marino and his hoods remove dominicks pants and shirt
sobbing as they undress his brother no balls you got no fuckin balls
they drag dominick toward a freshly dug grave and toss his limp barely conscious body into it
crying quietly dominick
nicky looks up to marino
they share a look before marino swings his bat striking nickys head
marino and his men start beating nicky who groans and spits blood as he is struck
nicky is stripped down to his underwear
hardy and fusco drag him to the grave and dump him over dominick
come on come on
marino and beeper look on as the other hoods begin the tedious work of tossing dirt on to the bodies shovel by shovel until they are covered up to their
we see nickys face bloodied and battered
hes still breathing and groaning
the word was out
the bosses had had enough of nicky
they had enough
how much were they gonna take
so they made an example of him and his brother
they buried them while they were still breathing
a full shovel of dirt lands upon nickys face and chest with a thud
ace is engulfed in flames
his jacket catches fire
he opens the door and rolls out onto the pavement barely escaping a smaller explosion
he lies on the floor as a ball of fire rises behind him
two men pull him away from the car
mister you all right
watch out the
ace watches as his car explodes in flames
ashes and debris fall on ace and the two men
mister you all right
they had other ideas for me
ace is being wheeled to an ambulance on a stretcher
there are firemen and policemen in the background
as ace is wheeled into the rear of the ambulance you sure are lucky mister
aces face disappears into the ambulance
aces car explodes
music in j
bach st matthew passion
the casino is being leveled actuality footage
the brand new room hotel with its entrance shaped like the mgm lions head
the town will never be the same
the hotel and casino implodes filling the screen with fire and smoke
tangiers the big corporations took it all over
today it looks like
slow motion of tourists walking into a casino looking like the living dead
a crowd gathers to watch a mock pirate ship sink in a tank
and while the kids play cardboard pirates mommy and daddy drop the house payments and juniors college money
the casino is destroyed floor by floor by explosions
on the poker slots
another room hotel built like an arthurian castle
in the old days dealers knew your name what you drank what you played
today its like checkin into an airport
and if you order room service youre lucky if you get it by thursday
the casino marquee topples to the ground in flames
today its all gone
you get a whale show up with four million in a
the living dead walk down a few steps marveling at the huge casino
suitcase and some twenty five year old hotel school kid is gonna want his social security number
the casino collapses into smoke and dust
after the teamsters got
a room hotel with a foot volcano out front
tourists watch it belch smoke and flames
knocked out of the box the corporations tore down practically every one of the old casinos
and where did the money come from
a giant glass pyramid stories high with a huge sphinx outside
to rebuild the pyramids
a house very much like aces house in vegas including the fact that it backs up on a golf course
we see ace inside talking on the phone with a bookie
into telephone still not sure
an older grayer ace is alone in his living room with tv sets fax machines and multiple phone lines
he is surrounded by newspapers and files
he is very much the way we saw him during his earlier handicapping days
from a television set theyre off and running
into telephone probable but may be questionable
well let me know as soon as you can find out
ace sets his cordless phone down and jots a few notes on a racing form
a television set shows a football game in the background
but in the end i wound up right back where i started
i could still pick winners and i could still make money for all kinds of people back home
and why mess up a good thing
and thats that
he takes off his glasses and gazes ahead
