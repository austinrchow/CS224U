written by nick villiers mens hands nicely groomed hold a small white terry towel spoiled by blood red spots
the hands rinse the towel in a copper bar sink
the stains soften but stay
a tan jacket sleeve spotted the same way moves into fram
the hands dab the wet towel at the spots with no more success and throw it into the sink
it falls half in still dripping the stains a drop at a time to the floor
the owner of the hands walks to a wine rack opens a bottle of white wine drizzles the wine on the jacket sleeve
the stains disappear
he hangs his jacket on a hook and walks from and up the narrow stairs
his footfalls echo against the unadorned cement block walls
we see his shape mid forties powerful his shirt pulled out
hes carrying the open bottle by the neck
still seen from behind the man emerges from the cellar into a contrastingly elegant space with a wood beamed
ceiling vaguely european
he walks along a narrow aisle of wooden diamond bins
as the space widens his foot hits something in his path
he bends to find a shoe
he glances about nervously
there are shutters on the storefront windows
shoe in hand he tightens the shutters
we see his profile a good looking man
he walks toward a brighter room at the back of the store the tasting room
now he retrieves a pair of womens trousers from the floor and as he straightens up we see his entire face genial venial redeemed by his smile
he speaks nonchalantly toward the room
twenty people tonight
i got a south beach widow a plastic surgeon they actually came together
these people all they really want is something to brag about at dinner parties
he swigs from the bottle of white wine grimaces detours behind the counter and spits the mouthful into the plastic lined wastebasket
he throws the bottle away
theres a basket of baguettes on the counter
alex breaks off an end and chews it to rid his mouth of the taste of the wine
still chewing he walks toward the tasting room
there i was passing the wine passing the bread i suddenly felt like the priest at masst or maybe mass started out as a wine tasting and jesus was a
what do you think
he goes into it seems empty except for a large wooden table folding chairs in disarray open bottles clustered at one end of the table
a chalkboard on the wall has chateau beychevelle written across it at the top vintages listed underneath
the womans voice that replies is gabriellas
with a throaty laugh maybe i should get dressed
leaning against the corner is a woman wearing only her panties and a shirt
in her mid twenties she has striking south american looks
shes sipping red wine from a plastic glass
i dont want to spoil a religious experience
ever heard of georges duboeuf
he throws away some of the glasses
duboeuf has a nose and a palate like a gift from god
he can taste a single grape before the harvest
and describe the beaujolais its going to produce
oh you have competition
you know how many bottles i have in this store
open any one of em ill tell you the vintage and vintner b lindfolded
he bends down to pick up the chunks of baguette strewn on the floor
he doesnt see her slip off her panties
she walks behind him twirling them into a tight band
she whips them over his eyes
she passes her glass under his nose
gabriella i picked these wines
so what is it
all i can smell is your perfume
im not wearing any
i even bought it for you
she opens her shirt
shes not wearing a bra
she lowers her breast to the glass and then to his mouth
tell me now
he kisses her wet breast
lot of body
he pulls off the panty blindfold kisses her on the mouth softly then fully
i lo e y u alex
alex is unlocking the door for gabriella
dressed she looks younger
theyre awkward with each other
dont think you have to say it because
say it alex
doesnt mean anything
it means something to me
were good together arent we
alex lets out a breath
were pretty good
he kisses her goodbye unlocks the door
she goes out to her honda civic
alex doesnt wait to see her drive off before he heads back to finish cleaning up the tasting room
alex straightens the last chair and starts to extract air from the open bottles
he hears a quiet clank of metal
instantly alert he reaches for his jacket and turns off the light
behind the cash register alex opens a drawer and takes out a revolver
ze thumbs the safety off
the noises recur like someone trying to break in through the back door from the parking lot
alex slings his jacket casually over the gun
alex throws open the back door hes counting on the element of surprise
his red cadillac convertible is idling nose
to the chain locked across the parking lot
a man in his twenties whose tropical shirt fairly glows under the security lights is using a pair of bolt cutters on the chain
you think youre gonna steal my car asshole
the younger man whirls around
you scared me man
a middle aged man a repo man calls out lazily from behind the wheel
this is not your car sir
this car belongs to the star leasing company
alex buries the gun in the rear of his waistband as though hes rubbing his stiff back and cranks his smile to a higher wattage than the security lights
i can collect either the money or the car
given how much you owe i figure its the car
the younger man has almost hacked through the chain
we inventory the property at the yard
he keeps his eye on the chain ready to gun the engine as soon as the exit is clear
i just want to show you something
worked by the combination of natural curiosity and alexs charm the repo man pops the trunk and gets out of the still running car
in his hand he has the locking club alex usually uses to secure his
hes not stupid
amused alex takes a step back palms up
what are you doing
the repo man ignores him and looks in the trunk
do you drink
not on the job
what is this booze
two cases of single malt whiskey aged in the barrel before he was born
the caddys overdue
so are you
drink it with the kid
teach him what smooth is
isnt that worth a few days breather
my accountants a fuck up
so am i maybe for not firing him
the bolt cutters clip through
the chain falls
alex is driving fast top down samba music loud on the stereo
he keeps time on the wheel as the miami skyline cruises by
alex turns into the garage of an expensive condominium building before the gate has slid all the way open
the tires squeal as he powers the car around the corner
hogs his space
alex lays the car in tightly
he has to squeeze out the door
he bumps the ducati
it starts to topple he grabs it before it goes over
alex lets himself in
the entry alarm starts to beep
he turns it off and resets it
the light has been left on in the kitchen
jason a handsome troubled year old with long dark hair is filing barbs off a pile of fishing hooks on the center island
he looks harder and wiser than his years
tackle is strewn everywhere
some spaghetti remains in the pot it was cooked in and jasons knife is standing upright in it
alex walks into the kitchen
he makes an effort to be pleasant although hes irritated by the mess by the motorcycle
its late jason
im going out tonight
you cantfish all night and work all day
working for you doesnt exactly tax my mind
no wonder you drop bottles
do you do it on purpose
fishing bought me my bike
i almost knocked it over trying to get out of the car
i wasnt sure you were coming home
the toaster oven dings
jason takes out a muffin it in two with his fishing knife
use a regular knife
this has a better edge
feel it pointing it at alex feel it
their voices are rising
pointed its a fucking weapon
put it away
hell with you
jason exits to the stairs
and keep your voice down
your mothers asleep
if you got home on time once in a while maybe she could skip the chemical help
alex is also on the stairs
you have no idea none zip what goes on in a marriage
yeah well im learning more than i want to
now what are you arguing about
is a pretty young woman in her late thirties with a sense of humor and irony
shes chemically relaxed but not stupefied
she pulls a robe around herself modest in front of her son and although her bodys not spectacular like gabriellas she has a trim
its not an argument
i asked him to clean up downstairs
maybe he hadnt finished a modicum of cooperation you know
modicum my ass
he pushes past his mother toward his own room
suzanne follows him down the hallway leaving
i dont like that tone from you
then go to bed
its too late for this
jason has gone into his room
he slams the door
enters his bedroom
suzanne alone for a moment to enter jasons room
hes my husband
i know mom
i still love him
she walks out
alex stands under water as hot as he can stand parboiling himself
eyes squeezed shut he lets out a long breath
his life demands more energy than he has anymore
he soaps himself thoroughly
suzanne hears the front door slam
jasons ducati starts up and accelerates away
alex comes out of the bathroom in a towel
lie down ill give you a back rub
she stumbles slightly against the bed catches a bed post for balance flops back on the bed with a laugh
maybe id better lie down
he bends down to kiss her then heads for the television
suzanne props herself up on her elbows
he pops a cassette into the vcr porno she assumes
she does her best
i liked the twin nurses
there was kind of a story
alex brings the remote control back to bed
youll like this one better
he hangs his towel on a doorknob slides into bed starts the tape which begins with sweat slick dancing girls at carnival
to suzannes astonishment it turns out to be a travelog
ive been so busy
we could sneak away for a week
would you like that
if we really go
last time i packed we went nowhere
last time was different
watching the tape the beaches i thought we had a beach
i read how the hotels keep spotters on the roof with scopes to keep thieves away from the guests
they can look at every inch of your body through the scope
with a low laugh do you mind that i like that
he has fallen asleep
tenderly she draws the sheet to his shoulder and settles down to watch the rest of the tape
on the flying bridge of an old fishing boat jason eases the throttle to idle speed
the engine quiets down
the swells slap harder against the wooden sides
the boat dips and dances to the music of the water
jason swings down the ladder
he sets up his linis to troll
the starry dome of the sky is starting to brighten around its rim
jason leans on the transom and stares at the flat silvery wedge of wake
he breathes out a word
he doesnt move
then the top of one of the rods shivers slightly goes still
jason delicately fingers the rod like a blind man reading braille to feel for vibration
a smile pulls at his mouth
he steps behind the rod
the fish hits
henryl fish ont the line screams out
he sets the hook
time to go to work man
a tall black drifter appears from below still yawning scratching
he wears a red panama hat thats weathered his head for some time
who we got
lets find out
he hauls back on the rod the line rises from the ocean they both recognize the fish at the end
miamis fished out of the good stuff
he spits over the side
this ones got more to worry about than you do
he starts to reel in the fish
henry moves to the wheel
just shoot jaws in the water
i want to know the suckers good and dead fore he sets a fin in my boat
you got a barb on that hook
jason braces for the fight
jason and henry are cutting the shark with the speed and dexterity of professionals
the gulf man thats the place
and what makes you think fifty fifty is right
slicing off the fins my fins
jason and henry slap their catch onto the fishmongers slippery counter
the markets noisy men shouting
we see the negotiation from a distance
jason and henry walk through the hubbub
jason guns his ducati
alex comes out of his office
rob has jason shown up
a mans french accented voice answers him from the store
you have his paycheck there
alex takes it and rips it up
the chinese chef in the busy steamy kitchen is inspecting the shark fins jason has brought him
jason is anxious to finish business and go
you no like my company
bring me more fin you retire
you no want to retire
dont charge starving chinese so much for these things
you ever caught a shark
you ever cook one
lemme lemme show you something
jason pulls up the sleeve of his denim jacket to display a fresh gash across his arm
he was already gaffed onto the side of the boat good as dead
two hours dead
and i was still too close to the mouth
revenge is the last instinct to go did you know that
the chef shrugs and shows his thumb missing a joint
works a dangerous thing
smiling with lots of nice fin jason
he tosses the fins in a cauldron of boiling water slaps the cash register on the side
jason jams on his helmet and starts his
motorcycle guns it down the street
jason weaves through traffic expert enough to take chances that goose the adrenalin
robert and alex are loading cases of wine into the trunk of the caddy when jason skids into the parking lot
he takes off his helmet
just get in the car
jason has fallen asleep while alex drives
alex picks up jasons hand
jerking awake jason tries to pull away but his reflexes are sleep slowed
alex sniffs jasons fingers wrinkles his nose lets jason have his hand back
theres wash in dries in the glove compartment
jason opens the compartment finds the packets opens one rubs his hands
im trying here jason i really am
when you didnt want to go to college i took your side i said fine i mean i didnt finish college and ive done all right
i gave you a job a steady check which is more than anybody else has done
and what do i get back
ive tried to teach you the business the care the finesse
jason laughs dismissively
well look at it this way jason someday youll have your boat and ill have my vineyard and the best part be theyre nowhere near each other
ill send you a christmas card
save the stamp
they turn into the driveway to an expensive development
the cadillac rolls to a stop at the ate
a tough but amicable looking armed guard in his forties mike opens the window of the air conditioned booth
his radio is tuned to the football game
hi mike whats the score
dolphins down by nine minute forty to go
dont underestimate marino
mike ticks off the appointment raises the gate
i told you they dont have it this year
with a wave of acknowledgment for mike alex
drives onto the grounds
grinning mike routinely writes down the license plate number
alex cruises past a collection of oversized villas and turns into the driveway of the gaudiest
he and jason climb out of the car
alex opens the trunk
he loads two wine cases into jasons arms takes the third himself
they havent said a word to each other
alex rings the intercom with his elbow
gabriellas voice crackles in response
on the intercom who is it
the intercom clicks off
they hear footsteps approaching
the door opens
jasons eyes focus
gabriella is smiling at alex
she has her arms full of clean burp cloths
oh the boss himself
with a modest chuckle how are you
she glances politely toward jason not at all expecting what she sees
a circuit connects between them
gabriella takes care of baby reese
this is my stepson jason
how do you do
is the wine for the boat
come through the house
they follow her inside
jason takes in the richness of the place but is more focussed on gabriella
they exit he lawn which leads to a dock
a sleek ocean going yacht is tied up at the dock the crew unobtrusively at work
frank reese a powerful confidant man in his mid sixties is sitting with his insurance agent at a table on deck where policies are spread out next to a jewelry
reeses expensive year old wife dina has turned her chair to sun her legs while she plays with the baby
whats the point of having it if i cant wear it frank
you can wear it anywhere you like mrs
reese except out of the country
gabriella leads alex and jason aboard
frank likes alex and is glad to see him
alex cant help glancing at dinas long legs
alex should we insure the wine while were at it
his arms tired alex is happy to set down the case
arent you covered on your home policy
ill show you come on
how much wine are we talking about
jason follows gabriella down below the voices on the deck fading
why bother insuring it
lets drink it instead
its quiet inside not tasteful but impressive like everything else of the reeses
jason takes a stab at conversation
gabriella laughs and looks over her shoulder at him
theyre both kids
ugly isnt it
he grins and relaxes looks around
the fittings are definitely yeah on the ugly side
but damn shes solid
oh a boat type
proud defensive i like
gabriella shows him the climatized built in wine closet next to the galley
he starts to rack the bottles while she watches
he talks to stop her from leaving
so where you headed
im not going i cant go
they dont want to take the baby
iadont have a green card i cant leave the country
baby goes with an american nurse
i house sit
you dont like them
i just dont like working for people but thats life
he chafes under authority the same way she does
doesnt have to be
maybe not with a rich stepfather
you dont appreciate what you have jason
its very poor where i came from
do i look it
i dont know i never been there
well i dont
my mothers indian
the india kind of indian
imagine a house where the father asks whats for dinner in spanish and the mother answers curry in hindi
que hay para cenar she says murgee masala ghaal
he says no es importante
no wonder im nuts
you dont seem too nuts
you dont know mel
theyre suddenly both very aware that theyre alone together
the agent is putting a magnificent diamond necklace in a velvet pouch that he fastidiously cinches and ties
alex looks away from it to take a bottle out of the remaining case on deck
so back to the safe it goes dina lifts up the baby and smells its bottom
dina thats disgusting
the alternative is using your fingers frank
which offends you more
frank pushes back his chair
dont encourage her alex
her mouth is big enough
dina is hurt
to the agent ill show you that painting in our stateroom
the agent follows him away
kindly to dina do you want to see the label
she hides her hurt by not looking at him
just open the bottle alex
pour us both a glass
im not allowed to drink alone
when she turns her head and looks at him shes flirting
jason has almost finished storing the wine
gabriella is sitting on a bar stool at the galley
listening to him snared by the quiet passion in his voice
when youre skimming along the water nothing between you and the bottom of the sea but a layer of wood your thoughts
all that noise inside your head
gabriella nods understanding exactly
dinas voice booms over the intercom startling both of them
the baby is fussing
gabriella makes a gesture of apology to jason
are you down there
the baby needs you
and bring a pacifier for frank
she slides off the stool
you should come out with me sometime
she smiles without answering and goes topside
his eyes follow her
a deckhand comes down the ladder with the remaining case of wine for him to stock
lifts the fussy baby from dina her hands sure and calming
she coos nonsense to his little ear as she reaches for the diaper bag and slings it over her arm
s ready for his nap
frank and the agent return from another section of the boat
you doing up to the house gabriella
off her nod want to take this with you
he sweeps the policies into a large manila envelope drops the pouch in with them ties the string hands it to her
put it on my desk
he looks at his wife with her glass alex with his glass and doesnt like it
his voice hardens slightly
are we all set alex
im going to check the storage room see what elsell travel
i know i put some vintage armagnac in there maybe some porto
he heads down the gangplank
hes a vendor dina
its like drinking with the help
did you pick the wine sweetie
frank grins pleased
his hand curves around her shoulder
he has forgotten about the other vendor present the agent
so ill messenger over the rider for your signature frank laughs out loud in a better mood you still here
dina laughs too
gabriella settles the baby on his side the only reese she likes
she starts to close the shutters
lullaby music is playing on the babys tape deck
she closes the nursery door as softly as possible
a mans hands go around her throat
her gasp dies stillborn
its alex kissing her
ear holding dinas diamond necklace to her neck
did he ever come on to you
dont sneak up on me that way
look how beautiful you are
hes an idiot if he didnt
now she sees the necklace
what are you doing
she snatches the necklace away from him and fairly runs down the hall to franks study
she tries td stuff it in the pouch
alex is right behind her
youre going to get me fired and deported
just put it on for a minute
look at yourself
she slaps at his hands half heartedly but its so tempting
see what you deserve
were both crazy
alex moves her hair away
she lets him hook the necklace around her neck
he reaches over to open the closet door fitted out now as a file cabinet but with the original closet mirror still in place
the safe is visible
gabriella stares at her reflection alex behind her watching her
the necklace changes her posture
she angles her chin slightly twists back her hair
diamonds suit her
into her ear not against your skin
he starts to pleat her t shirt loose from her jeans
she doesnt resist
they watch each other in the mirror
theyre waiting for you
alex blows out a frustrated breath
he hurriedly unhooks the necklace and puts it back in the pouch gathers up the insurance papers and polaroids that had spilled and slides them back in the envelope with
gabriella is tucking in her t shirt
she closes the closet door
jasons voice is closer more impatient at the bottom of the stairs
alex appears at the top of the stairs surprising jason
i was in the bathroom
he walks down the stairs
a wooden case of liquor is by the terrace doors where he left it
give me a hand will you
im not as young as you are
he goes out the door ahead of jason leaving him to carry the case
jason hears a door close upstairs as he lifts the case
he looks up
reflected in the tall entry mirror gabriellas back as she walks away down the hall
his face tightens
he follows alex
a poker game is breaking up
five players alex among them
hes done all right
dave an older man has lost
he tosses down his cards
im out im home
you play for the possibilities dave
so do i
or else why get up in the morning
victor spansky neatly stacks his modest winnings
hes tall thick shouldered with a gray crew cut tinted glasses and a smokers cough
he does nothing in a hurry
you didnt lose that much
theres an optimist in every game
alex i dont appreciate overriding htm no im saying
the guy who sits down at the table with a losers attitude
loses even if he wins which he wont
hes got no juice flowin
hes got peepee in his veins
life for that guys a habit and stained pants
you know what i mean
dave laughs feeling better
they all ad lib good night see you next week etc
as they file out
alex and victor are the last in the room
alex puts on his jacket
paltry pickings tonight
alex looks at the small amount of cash on the table
you want to cut for whats here
he pushes his cash forward into a pot with alexs
alex fans the deck across the table
what are you doing with your life victor
victor makes a small gesture indicating the cards
this more or less
he pulls a card he has good hands and turns it up
a king of spades
a smile tugs at his mouth
alex produces the polaroid of dinas necklace from his inside jacket pocket
he flicks it on the table next to victors king
victors gaze clicks from the photo to alex back to the photo
he slowly reaches out and picks it up
i remember when it was the cover of the auction catalogue
the duchess of windsors baubles
bought for a young wife i remember
who im sure worked just as hard as the duchess
its appraised at a million three hundred thousand dollars
victor tosses the photo back on the table with and they say theres no inflation
i have access
victor shakes his head no
i dont need that much
you need as much as i do
victors eyes blink behind his glasses
what kind of access
for curiositys sake
i have a friend in the house
ii can distract her
i dont trust women as a svecies
id have a spotless record if it werent for a woman
shed never know i dont want her to know
i like her too much
i dont trust amateurs either
he gets up and walks to the door
dont take it personally
i dont trust the phone company the jury system or the israeli government
so why should i trust you
because i know a good thing when i see it
alex flips over a card
its the king of clubs
victor has been distracted by alexs proposition
now he comes back to scoop up his money
alex sweeps the cards back into a stack leaving only the photo on the table
but this is fifty fifty
mid masturbation jason is distracted by the beeping of the entry alarm
he glances at the bedside clock that reads
his excitement subsides
he rolls onto his stomach
alex detours toward the dark kitchen
suzanne is reading in bed
the door opens slightly
she looks over her mouth draws in
a bottle of champagne wags around the door followed by alex and a pair of champagne flutes
i saw the light still on
im glad youre up
eyeing the champagne whatd you do this time
hes too pumped to take offense
cmon cmon be nice
whenever you open champagne its such a giveaway
he pours her a glass
i told you i was playing poker tonight
he hands her the glass
she takes a sip
you know ive never actually seen you play poker maybe poker doesnt even exist
maybe its just a cover story men use
hey lightning strikes
he fills his glass
lets not get into this honey
her voice is tired
i was charging the groceries today and they kept the card
wed been cancelled
i know he reaches for his wallet
i felt about as big as an ant
alex takes out a credit card
i got you a new one
he holds out the card which she slowly takes fingers
its the third time this year
everythings about to change
suzanne has heard that too often from him
alex what are we doing together
we dont talk all the time
we dont fuck we dont even eat dinner together anymoret i am making an effort heret jason throws himself out of bed and turns on his stereo cranks the volume
he doesnt want to hear their voices
alex and suzanne hear the music
he rubs his hand through his hair
did you never have a fight with his father
hard flat no
i shouldve guessed
must be at the right amid of god this very minute
suzanne doesnt bother replying
she turns off the light pulls the sheet to her shoulders
alex sits down on the window seat to enjoy the champagne in the dark
alex is on the phone
the humidifier wasnt holding a steady percentage there may be a problem with the regulator so id better check it right away
sure this afternoons fine
hanging up he rocks back in his chair and squeezes his eyes shut
then he rests his forehead against the heels of his hands for a moment considering what hes considering
alex walks through
jasons on a ladder stocking the shelves
you want to hand me down a good cognac
im going out to the reeses
no gimme the pierre ferrand
jason starts down the ladder
ill deliver it for you
alex is surprised and pleased by jasons sudden helpfulness
he wants to talk
he dusts off the bottle
alex follows dina down a narrow service hall to the wine room
she talks without looking back at him
enough of an investment in there not to want to take a chance with a month away
thats what i thought
a month alone with frank
alex chuckles as he starts to inspect the humidifier
the first one was bad enough
shes standing too close to him but he has no room to maneuver away
he fiddles with the box
it may need a part replaced
you always dress well alex
she brushes the lint off his jacket and leaves her hand there
this is not a great idea
used to getting her way shes not easily dissuaded
how can you tell
she moves up against him
alex cant will himself to resist
his knee automatically separates her legs
he reaches out to close the door
gabriella is returning from the laundry room with an arm load of clean crib sheets
knowing alex and dina are inside the wine room she stops and knocks on the door
the babys ready for a long moment later the door opens
dina and alex are reassembled but theres a tension and a breathlessness about them gabriella recognizes
thank you gabriella
dina spies some interaction between gabriella and alex and her pretty face hardens
did you leave him by himself
just to get his sheets
thats the maids job
hes in his playpen
dina sweeps out
she looks over her shoulder to make sure gabriella is behind her
are you coming
youll walk yourself out
have a good cruise
ill take care of this
see you in a month
alex watches the two women move down the hall
turn the corner
youre not very happy here are you
as he yanks a wire loose from the humidifier
alex climbs the open stairs heads down the cantilevered walkway knocks at victors door
for an instant alex doesnt recognize the uniformed repairman who opens it victor disguised
by daylight the apartment looks shabby
i think i look younger dont you
you look ridiculous
i dont have an ego
zipping up his as long as i dont match my mug shots
a shadow of anxiety passes over alexs face
you want to change your mind
victor opens the front door
as alex walks toward the door he catches sight of a free standing hospital respirator in the bedroom
he looks at victor who waits for him with an unchanging smile
they go out together
the cadillac pulls up alex driving victor beside him
mike is not in the guard booth the gate is closed
they wait in the heat
is your makeup melting
offended victor reaches over to honk the horn
alex stops him opens the drivers door
alex goes into the booth finds the appointment board checks off gates wine repair and presses a button that opens the gate
alex slides back behind the wheel
victor is resting his head on the back of the seat
weve violated the law before we even get started
down the side of the house the dock
can be seen empty
alex rings the front bell
victor is carrying a tool kit
theres no answer
alex rings it again
tell me were at the wrong house
alex raises a hand to wave victor turns
mike the guard is rolling toward them on a security cart
he pulls over
there you are mike
dont flip the gate like that
i was helping you out
i checked off the appointment didnt you see it
he rings the doorbell again
they sailed out this morning
but the nannys supposed to be here victor rolls his eyes unseen
they fired her
with a snigger dont pay to be too good looking in these jobs
victor interrupts the gossip
he sounds exactly like a repairman
i got a schedule to keep mr gates
is this gonna be another day
it cant wait
hell lose his entire wine collection if the humidifier isnt fixed
whats your name
mike notes the name harold stitched onto his coveralls
ill get the keys
he rides away on his cart
victor sits down in the shade to wait
he stifles a cough
a cop on the job
you all right
a little too sharply why wouldnt i be
jason is filling a wine order when he hears a womans voice murmuring upstairs and recognizes gabriellas
jason comes up out of the cellar
gabriella is passing a note to robert
where he can reach me
she turns her head and he sees that she has been crying
his smile goes
you looking for alex
you missed him
i told her
the phone rings
robert answers it wine business
hes out of the conversation
i was supposed to let him into the reeses
so now youre in trouble
no im not
shes walking toward the door

jason follows her toward her car parked down the street

you dont have papers they dont even want to meet you
and the only real way to get legal is to get married

he opens her car door for her
so lets go get married
gabriella looks at him
again it scares her
are you old enough to vote
she slides behind the wheel
youre not too much older

you can gimme a ride
hes already walking around the car to get in the other side
gabriella smiles in spite of herself and reaches over to unlock the door for him
as he climbs in arent you working

well lets not tell the boss i stole you
gabriella drives fast and well
did you do something
or was it just
they said they
like theyre a factory

she whips the car through the turn narrowly missing another car
she laughs shes starting to relax
alex and mike watch victor checking out the humidifier making a meal of the diagnosis
he notices the wire alex sabotaged but doesnt remark on it
can you fix the thing harold
or does it have to be replaced
ill tell you after i see the condition of the pipes
coolant might be leaking
wheres the attic access
victors legs disappear up into the attic as he hauls himself off a step stool and up through the hatch in the ceiling
mike and alex watch him go
victor is heard goddamn fiberglass his head drops through the hatch
either of you know how to kill the water to the house
oh yeah yeah sure
mike starts down the stairs
alex signals to victor that hes going with him and follows mike away
victor waits until he hears the door close before dropping down through the hatch and heading for franks office
gabriella watches jason walk with a long stride toward henrys boat
she likes the way he moves
henry is nearby drinking beer with some haitians
jason talks to him for a moment
henry glances down the walkway to gabriella then hands jason his
jason gestures to gabriella to come down
mike is shutting off the water while alex watches when another guard mid s turns the corner
what are you doing
mike looks up wet and muddy
i been waiting for you
his uniform is crisp and his nature is alert and suspicious
the valves stuck
thats the sprinkler valve
mike climbs out of the bushes with injured dignity
okay you do it
is he the homeowner
victor wearing surgical gloves is in the file closet cracking the safe
he has re wired the alarm wire with electrical clips to avoid breaking the circuit
he smears the sweat off his forehead and leans back in close to the dial rotating it carefully back and forth until the tumblers fall
victor sifts through papers foreign currency
victor hears the footsteps coming up the stairs
he keeps searching but the pressure tells and his breathing becomes a wheeze
the new guard follows alex onto the landing
they hear a door shut
the guard instinctively touches his gun
down there wasnt it
the guard doesnt let him change direction
victor drops down onto the stepstool in front of them as they round the corner
you can turn the water back on
its not the pipes
wearing work gloves he repositions the hatch cover
nobodys supposed to be in the house unaccompanied
is that our fault
all right then
the guard glances up at the hatch
in that moment victor winks at alex he scored
jason drops anchor in turquoise waters off a sand bar no other boats around
gabriella takes in the idyllic surroundings
you can learn on the fish around here but you cant eat em
theyre junk fish
will you teach me
oh you think youre ready for that kind of commitment
she grins and shrugs
im only investing an afternoon
she takes in the landscape breathing in the lovely isolation
where are we
my father used to bring me here
she hears something in his tone
jason concentrates on securing the boat
he drowned in a storm
she shivers involuntarily
he was a fisherman
i dont know if i would like boats after that
i feel close to him when im on the water
how old were you
id just turned eight
she takes his hand
he tightens his fingers through hers and looks out at the horizon trying to control the emotions her sympathy has roiled
gabriella senses this
she puts her arms around him kisses him on the cheek
they stand holding each other
then jason on impulse kisses her on the lips
the key is heard in the lock the door opens victor and alex come in giddy with success
reverentially victor unpacks the necklace and holds it up for them both to admire the object of desire
look at the fire
hold it up to the light
he hands the necklace to alex who lifts it up to look at it
victor reaches into a drawer
in ithttheereess a gun and a camera
he takes out the camera
the flash jerks alexs picture of alex with gaze from the what the fuck are you doing
i always take a photograph of the goods
to avoid any disagreement in the sale
the insurance photo is hopeless
you ask yourself how do they stay in business
alex advances on him
you put me in the shot
speaking of insurance
alex is closing on him
his voice is low and menacing
give me the film victor
victors hand glides into the drawer
alex sensibly stops short
pleasantly well tear it up together whet
we have the money
honor among thieves is a myth you know
victors hand reappears holding not a gun but an airline ticket which he gives to alex
whats this supposed to be
i thought it over
i cant move it
im on parole
so youll fly to newark take a shuttle into the city catch a cab take a walk find an address ill give you the name pas
de probleme as they say in bordeaux
hes being condescending
meaning youre too chickenshit to do it yourself
maybe i am
all right i am
he looks at the ticket
i dont fly economy
jason is standing behind gabriella helping her cast
his arm grazes her breast
you can do anything you want out here you can swim nude you can her laugh cuts him off
i am not taking my clothes off
flustered irritated thats not what i meant
he reels the line out of the water
gabriella climbs the rail
the breeze blows her thin dress against her legs
she dives into the water
he kicks off his shoes dives in after her
when they are together they thetboati ela ughing i ng her nkl t arm under her breasts pull i o together
hey quit laughin
im saving your life here
the store is closed
robert has gone home
alex opens the cash drawer and takes out all the money fattens his wallet
he spies the message from gabriella
he reads it picks up the phone punches in the number she wrote
may i speak with gabriella
puedo hablar con gabriella
making a face no yo no quiero dejar un mesajo gracias
voy a llamarla mas tarde
he hangs up and speed dials a number from the typed list on the wall
hey ted its alex gates
i need a couple of tickets to new york for tonight first class
his jaw tightens dont sweat the account ill pay jason is sprawled half across gabriella on the deck of the boat a seat cushion under her head
he has his hand in her panties
she clutches his wrist and pulls his hand back into sight
he lifts his head to look at her
he sits up offended
you waited long enough to tell me
gabriella arranges her clothes
because it felt good and im an idiot
he fondly touches her face with the back of his hand
no youre not
she scrambles to her feet
i want to go back now
can we go back please
he stands up and moves to the helm his legs stiff with injured dignity
gabriella sits down on the bench the cushion clutched in front of her
jason sneaks a look back at her
with her hair wet and her makeup washed away she looks younger than he does
shes resting her chin on the edge of the cushion
he switches on the engine and eases the boat forward over the anchor engages the power winch
the chain starts to im sorry
she turns her head toward him
a bridge has parted
underneath the boat makes its way on the opalescent water
skyscrapers swagger down either side of the river their windows bright squares against the darkening sky
the signal bell sounds
the dinner hour
the table in the mean little house is too crowded and too noisy the television on the buffet can hardly be heard
gabriellas cousin and her husband are arguing in spanish in a good natured marital way the kids too busy teasing each other to notice
one kid gets up to raise the volume on the tv set even louder
gabriella carries her plate into the kitchen to escape the noise
the husband makes a gesture to his wife that says gabriellas snooty
gabriella stands at the counter listlessly finishing her dinner
the phone rings
she answers it
alex talks into the visor speaker i got your note
fuck the reeses
were taking a trip honey
pack a bag
ill pick you up in an hour
the tension drains from her face rescued
where are we going
does it matter
a not anywhere you are i want to be there
dont worry its not ohio
suzanne turns onto their street pulls into the garage
she sees alexs cadillac already parked
she locks her car and walks toward the elevator carrying a department store shopping bag
the garage is darker than she likes
her heels echo against the cement walls
she walks a little faster
suzanne lets herself in
alex didnt set the alarm
she sets the bag on the couch next to his jacket
shes been a wife too long not to tidy up after him
she picks up the jacket to brush it and hang it correctly and glimpses the airline tickets tucked in the inside pocket
suzanne smiles moved
the tickets to rio
she takes a peek to see the dates
her face changes
she drops the jacket in a heap on the floor
she hears alex moving around in the bedroom above and starts up the stairs her rage climbing with every riser
she can hear him humming
alex zips his passport into an outside compartment where he can reach it
he has almost finished packing
as he reaches for his underwear he startles
suzanne is leaning against the door frame
where are you going
alex recovers quickly
i got a problem with a supplier
boutique wineries theyre all owned by ex lawyers
via new york
she holds up the tickets
i need to see the wholesaler
youre amazing you really are
now how are you going to explain miss vasquez
honey i dont have to
i will out of courtesy
and shes fifty years old suzanne
shes the agent
god i could even believe you if i wanted to
i dont want to fight with you on my way out the door
i dont have time for this
yanking the tickets out of her hand before she can react he pushes past her with his bag
she follows him down the stairs
i put terrys life insurance money into that store and you spend it on your goddamn girlfriends while my checks bounce
alex whirls around at the bottom of the stairs
i worked my ass off for you with that store
eight years of twelve hour days and one day weekends
so dont tell me i havent treated you well
he picks his jacket up off the floor and shrugs it on
suzanne snatches his car keys off the coffee table
infuriated he grabs for his keys but she holds them away behind her back
youre going to talk to me
when i get back
with more of your fucking lies
i hate you
wasting my slapping at his arm with her free hand life
sssh calm down she tries to slap him again but he gets hold of her hand
give me my keys i need my keys
i dont want to hurt you
thats all you ever do
he twists her hand up behind her back forcing her onto the sofa
go to hell
he smothers her into the cushion and twists her hand up and up
she grips his keys tighter
breathless from the open your hand suzanne
pinning her down he painfully pries open her fingers
she drives her elbow into his face
he hits her back her nose starts to gush the keys drop to the floor
he bends to pick them up
suzanne seizes a standing metal ashtray and savagely swipes him across the temple
the blow sends him sprawling to the floor he doesnt move
she is stunned by what she has done
in a panic she races up the stairs the heel of her hand to her nose to staunch the bleeding
suzanne spills everything out of alexs suitcase and starts throwing in her own clothes blood spotting them in her haste
suzanne jerks out his drawers so fast that she dumps them on the floor
she pulls his suit out of the closet along with an armful of other clothes
suzanne drags two suitcases clattering down the stairs
suzanne drops to her knees beside him and squeamishly lifts his wallet out of his pocket snatches the cash lets the wallet fall back beside him
her breathing is so rapid and shallow it sounds like whimpers
suzanne backs out the door pulling the suitcases right into jason
she cries out in fright
dont go in therel were he sees the blood smeared all over her face her clothe and charges past her
ready to kill jason is shocked to see the job apparently already done for him
he bends over alex to see if hes dead and is equally sorry and relieved to find out he isnt
i wont wait for you
jason takes the stairs two at a time
he yanks his map of the gulf off the wall and grabs his fishing gear
alexs unconscious body blocks the closet
jason tries to open it anyway but alex is too heavy
seizing hold of him jason drags him away from the door
the jewelry pouch spills out of alexs pocket
jason doesnt see it
the horn blares outside
jason pulls his rod out of the closet
as he steps over alex he spots the pouch the drawstring loose enough to let the necklace protrude
the horn blasts again
jason swoops up the pouch
jason runs for the car with his gear and climbs in
suzanne peels away before the door is completely closed
jason and suzanne
she cant look at him
she concentrates on her driving
what the hell happened in there
is he dead
whatd you hit him with
a laugh bubbles out of jesus an ashtray
he doesnt even smoke
on the verge of hysteria shes laughing so hard she can hardly drive
tears run down her face muddying the dried blood shes a holy mess
pull over pull over
he wrenches the wheel and steers the car to the curb
he gets out and lopes around the car to the drivers side
the car recedes down the highway
gabriella is sitting on the front step with her suitcase waiting
she rubs her legs as though she has been there a long time
the dogs are barking inside
the phone is ringing
alex still hasnt moved
jason is waiting behind the wheel
suzanne gets back in the car
she has pulled a cotton sweater over her bloody clothes and washed her face
shes presentable again and subdued
he starts the car
did you figure out where were going
well head for the gulf see what we like
he sounds like her contemporary not her kid
i remember your dad saying the sand was as white as the whites of gods eyes on the gulf
do you still miss him
slowly she shakes her head no
i cant see his face anymore
i cant hear his voice
but when you come home from fishing with the sea and the salt and the engine oil
its like hes walking through the door
i love that smell i can still smell him
she watches the highway posts clack past
victor is soaking a dishtowel under the faucet
he wrings it out
mugged by your wife
victor comes into the room with the wet towel and throws it at alex who is sitting now on the couch
alex catch s it holds it to his bloody head
ill fucking kill her
when do the reeses come home
not for a month
plenty of time
how long a drive is it
to the gulf
he removes the towel from his head
youre going to need stitches
do you have a sewing kit
ill stop at my doctors
i darned my own socks in prison
suzanne and jason cross the parking lot toward the coffee shop which anchors a suburban surface mall
he notices a jewelry store
they reach the restaurant
he opens the door for suzanne
order something for me okay
im stiff i need to walk around
hes already walking away
concern and exasperation cancel each other she goes inside
jason approaches the cheerful elderly jeweler repairing an earring behind the case
the man puts away his smile
jasons long hair and leather jacket offend him
my grandmother asked me to bring in a necklace of hers jason takes the velvet pouch out of his pocket unlaces it spreads out the necklace on the counter
he leans forward on his elbows while the jeweler examines it with a loupe
when the jeweler looks up hes angry
your grandmother lets you carry around a million dollars worth of jewelry
go put it back where you found it
the jeweler pours the necklace back in the pouch cinches it closed slaps it on top of the case
those arent real diamonds
tell your grandmother to bring it in
the jeweler buzzes the door to release it
jason grabs the velvet pouch strides out
the waitress unloads plate after plate on the table where suzanne is waiting for jason
pan san strawberry waffle eggs over side of wheat toast ham steak hash browns fruit cup two o
s coffee milk extra syrup
the waitress laughs as she strolls away
hes worried about the jeweler
lets pack it up picnic on the beach someplace
with a grin what a romantic
as jason and suzanne reach the car he sees the jeweler on the sidewalk now outside the store gesticulating to a sign painter
he wants to tell her he took the necklace
the jeweler happens to glance in their direction
jason ducks into the car unnoticed
jason and suzanne are sitting on a small rickety pier eating from the takeout boxes open on their laps
adrenalin does that
it aint adrenalin its freedom
and she slips her wedding ring off her finger and hurls it overhand as far as she can
it drops into the sea
i dont want one goddamn thing of she eats with gusto
jason is staring at the water
i cant believe you did that
suzanne is driving now
she glances over at jason sprawled low in the seat
she doesnt think hes going to answer her
i didnt even say goodbye
itll work itself out
this is what you always wanted
how much money do we have
suzanne doesnt reply
at the reception window suzanne is checking in with the motel owner a solidly built ruddy woman in her fifties who shouldnt wear sleeveless blouses
suzanne has her wallet open
her fingers hesitate at the credit card
theres a cash discount
sounds like cash
she starts to count it out
ensconced at a table under an umbrella jason is writing on a paper towel
i dont know if youll get this letter
i dont know if ill send it
all i know is that for some reason i need to write it
cross the parking lot
he crumples the paper towel
she holds up the keys for him to see
i should have given you the king size
suzanne isnt offended
hes my son
the owner gives her a startled glance
you look great
jason is sitting on the lawn chair outside the room door working on his letter again under the yellow bug light
the coke machine hums noisily next to him
that day on the boat made me realize i understand the sea better than i do the world
suzanne stirs awake disoriented spooked
she sits up in bed
jason comes in from outside
im right here
suzanne shoves her fingers through her damp hair swallows to clear her voice
i dreamed i was in jail
youd come to see me you were on the other side of the plastic like at the bank
and you were talking but i couldnt hear you
i put my ear to the holes and i couldnt hear you but your mouth was moving
and then i realized you couldnt talk anymore
hed cut your vocal cords like that dog next door
she lies down again
when you were a kid
im on watch
car speeds north
alongside the gulf shimmers under the mirror of the sky
i know what lure to use to catch any fish in the water but whats the lure for a woman
a tint combed through her hair the plastic cap tied in a rakish bow suzanne lays out what remains of her cash by denomination
she records the amount in a pocket notebook shes using as a ledger
one morning just as the sky started to lighten jason is fishing
i caught a fish that had three hooks grown through his lips
three times hed gotten away
he kept taking the hook
jason is gutting and skinning his catch
it occurs to me that youre the fisherman not me
i can feel the tension of the line
ive taken the hook just like he did
coastal towns have been crossed out one after the other
alex stitches in his head pores over the map while victor talks on the phone
he circles a new town on the gulf farther north
eight faceted cut
could be the whole piece or individual stones preference for the whole piece
will you put out the word
no im consulting for the insurance company isnt life strange
love and kisses
he hangs up
his cheeriness vanishes
he coughs more like a gag and heads for the bathroom
victor spits blood in the sink
then after catching his breath squirts medicine down his throat with his inhaler exits
ive called the whole network of fences from here to tampa
lets hope well find her before she sells
victor picks up a chair and smacks it down
this is not a water view suite in marbella
did you notice
theres no fruit and champagne from the management
i dont see swiss chocolate on the pillows
my masseuse is not at the door
and i am fucking dying alex
i dont intend to cough to death in a county clinic because you screwed up
thats not fair
the plan was for you to move the necklace
i wouldnt have had the goddamn thing
try to relax
he reaches for victors cigarettes and crumples the package in his fist
victor looks at his ruined smokes
im not good at giving up things
dockside restaurant day jason eats a sandwich at atable working on his letter
i want to take you out with me when the winds blowing whitecaps and the currents running against the wind just to hear your hair slap against your skin
when will i see you
he glances up
her hair a better brighter color under her chefs hat is cooking on the grill behind the counter kidding the customers enjoying herself
the greasy aproned owner pats her rump as he goes by not for the first time
long arms short dick they always say
one of the fishermen guffaws
the owner looks pissed
so does jason who witnessed it all
aside to suzanne can i see you in the office after lunch please
suzanne luxuriates in a
bubble bath a glass of wine in her hand the bottle next to the tub
shes talking to jason through the closed door
i was not fired you jerk
jason is prying a diamond out of the necklace with his fishing knife
with a laugh for about a minute it was very satisfying
concentrating on the you did the right thing
jason has put on his suit changed his looks
he sizes up the store
jason scans the case as he approaches the jeweler
do you buy estate diamonds
jason takes out a zip lock bag and lays it on the counter one of the diamonds inside
the jeweler takes it out with respect and holds it under his loupe
if jasons nervous it doesnt show
it belonged to my mother
the jewelers heard every version
he doesnt care
price is the same
i can give you eighty five hundred
the classified section already folded and marked beside her suzanne has propped herself on her elbows
shes looking out to sea
talking heads bob like buoys the waders
she notices some distance away a man in a suit walking along the beach
the image amuses her
hes moving in her direction
she finally recognizes jason and raises her hand
she puts on her hat to cut the glare
from under the brim she admires his approach
as he reaches her look at you
whats the occasion
jason squats down beside her and balls up the classifieds
you dont need another grab ass job
i been out talking to peoplel
theres charter outfits a coupla towns up the coast
names of towns
they need skippers they need crews
she stands up brushes off the sand rolls up her towel
so were packing
they start walking together
from the water a man calls out to suzanne
hey i thought you were coming back in
she smiles and waves goodbye
i kinda liked that she and jason keep walking
he no longer looks like a boy
alex is smelling his brandy in a booth
he looks defeated
victor swings onto a bar stool
he takes out a wallet photo of suzanne and jason and passes it across to the bartender
seen them by any chance
why are you asking
my wife and son
hes been selling fish around these parts
hes totally believable
the bartender feels for his pain and takes another look at the photo shakes his head no
shes a little classier than our usual clientele yknow
maybe you could pass it down anyway
the bartender takes the photo
joins alex in the booth
victor raises his hand
alex instinctively pulls his head back
he leans across the table and plucks the last stitch out of alexs wound
its been irritating me all day
did i hurt you
alex stares him down
hey i know this kid alex and victor glance over to the bar and see henry
hes looking at the photo victor passed around
hunches a catch like a depth finder
victor is already out of the booth
henry senses money to be made
who are you
i thought his father was dead
shaking his head well you look bad all right but not dead
hungover thats all
im his stepfather
with a chuckle oh man now i see why he blew town
victors insulted enough to lose his patience and his poise
the question before us is where did he go
henry says nothing
he wants to be paid
victor whips out a fifty dollar bill from his top pocket
henry reaches for it but victor holds it back wanting an answer first
he wouldnt be on the gulf
he hated the gulf
alex has moved up to the bar to listen behind him unnoticed
he shakes his head at victor
hes down in the keys somewhere
victor puts the fifty back in his own pocket
henry stands aggressively
that aint cool in my book
in a swift unexpected move victor jams henry back down on his bar stool
the bartender starts toward them
alex slips out the door
the stool and henry are toppling over
victor catches them both sets henry upright
now sit there
and calm down
victor is ill but not weak
henry looks away the classic signal of submission
alex is waiting for victor outside
they cant be too far
victor stares at him
i never understand your optimism
or he wouldnt have lied
i think you made a friend
victor turns around alex keeps walking
is in the doorway to the bar
whats it to you if i see the kid
from a distance we see jason follow a beefy jeans wearing salesman into the building
the salesman walks jason past the vertical rows of boats stacked from ceiling to floor extolling the virtues of his stock
jason inspects a modest boat takes out cash
jason is helming a classic wooden fishing boat the hercules ii old and not too big but with good lines
hes purely happy
jason steers toward the beach and drops anchor
theres a cabin among the palmettos
jason comes into the cabin
just to be sure mom
the cabin is silent
he uses his fishing knife to pop loose a section of the cheap wall paneling
behind it a square of sheet rock has been sliced away between the studs to accommodate the pouch
he drops the pouch in his tackle box
a car is heard pulling up
jason frantically starts to jam the paneling back in place
it wont hold
suzanne takes a flat of geraniums out of the trunk and sets them on the porch
she opens the door
just as suzanne steps through the screen door jason sees that his tackle box is open the velvet pouch in plain sight
he kicks the top closed bends to lock it
theyll think you stole it
he looks up at her caught
shes walking toward the kitchen sink to wash the nursery dirt off her hands
she looks out the window at the boat again
over her shoulder are you allowed just to run around with it
his tension ebbs
he picks up his tackle box
i forgot my tackle box
dont take advantage jason
they trusted you with the job
he kisses her quickly
its not a problem
he escapes out the door
alex is sitting on the bed dialing a number
he can see victor shirtless in the bathroom
his scars surprise us
victor is trying with effort to suppress a cough
gabriella is cooking herself dinner
shes greedily grateful to hear alexs voice
i saw on the news theres rain in san francisco
are you wet and miserable
exhausted alex stretches out on the bed to talk to her
napas farther north
victor comes out of the bathroom
hes waiting for news
she leans on the counter flirting with his voice
tell me you love me
i love you
her smile vanishes
who just laughed
alex holds the phone out to victor
she wants to talk to you
just fucking say hello okay
victor takes the phone
alex snatches the phone back from him
his harsh tone unsettles her
i miss you
are there any messages
she carries the phone to the counter where she keeps mail and any messages and starts to leaf through the stack
her eye falls on a crumpled light blue envelope she moves it out from the pile
it has been forwarded several times
and its addressed to her
its lonely here
theres no return address
she slits it open with her thumbnail
a trickle of sand falls out
what about the messages
instead she opens the letter
ive started this letter a dozen times gabby
she puts down the letter and quickly finds the message memo
here it is
raines called from name of town
he said you id know what it was about
do you need the number
sitting up alex signals success to victor and writes down the number
ill call you tomorrow
he hangs up excited
victor has already started to pack
and you had no faith
ill save the party hats until its in our hands
gabriella is reading the second page of jasons letter
i look out at the flat blue sea and the darker bl ue where the gulf deepens and i want you next to me
ai want to walk across the
sugar sand and wade into the water with you until the current lifts us and floats us nothing weighting us down aslight and thoughtless as fish
will i ever see you
shes deeply moved
and it occurs to her that she has picked the wrong man
victor parallel parks jewelry store with his usual careful manner
victor and alex kid each other without rancor for the moment
i miss the cadillac
you have pimps tastes alex
at least my cars inconspicuous
alex starts to get out
you all right
a lot of these jewelers might know my face
how about for me
victor takes out the photo of alex with the necklace and holds it up for him
nobodys seen this yet
ill do it
alex throws open the door and barrels out of the car
the jeweler who bought the diamond from jason lays it on a velvet pad for alex whos posing as the insurance investigator
with a shrug said it was his mothers
a seventeen year old kid waltzes in with a diamond as big as your toenail and you dont wonder
you shouldnt have touched iti you know that
all right okay
when we recover the rest of the necklace ill be back
do not do not sell it
ill see what i can do for you raines
i appreciate that
victor and alex are having a beer near the wide screen tv
a game is on
she lets jason make the sale
they get caught hes underage and she dont know a thing
i gotta give her credit
you have interesting taste in women
alexs gaze wanders to the game but he cant get interested
it barrels up the highway passing the same landmarks suzanne and jason did
victor is driving alex reading the map
he circles a town name
victor cranes to see it
a storm is blowing in and jason walks quickly along the docks to his boat and swings aboard
the waves have already started to slap against the sides of the boat
jason tosses over his fenders and secures them to protect the boat from the pilings
he starts toward the cabin
the lock has been popped
the door is slightly ajar
he hears a noise inside
he draws his knife
jason throws open the door
a figure is bent over in the galley
it turns and by the light of the refrigerator jason recognizes henry
what the hell you doing
howd you know this was my boat
i saw you cast off
good little sport boat you got too
oh whoa hear that
henry rubs his stomach
right here man
i aint been eating my share since my fishing partner ran off
without so much as goodbye good luck
jason blows out a breath
the boat is rockirg now
the wind has picked up
they hear the clanking and rubbing of the other boats
jason starts checking all the hasps and latches while henry eats the sandwich he made
so why are you on the gulf
my baby finally sank on me
right at the dock
i thought id work charter for awhile
moving to help jason with the latches need a crew
i dont know
thats not why i came looking for you
jason is checking the engine
out of henrys sight he surreptitiously reaches inside a hidden compartment
wraps around the concealed pouch and withdraws reassured
secures the engine hatch
a guy offered me fifty bucks to tell him where you were
sick old motherfucker
big as god
tried to say he was your stepfather
maybe it was
no no no no this guy was not any kind of family man if you know what i mean
so youre in some deep shit because he wasnt a cop neither
whatd you tell him
lots of ways to make fifty bucks
misunderstanding jason shoves him up against the counter
you gonna lean on me henry
is that the plan
henry is hurt and offended
no man i wouldnt stoop that low
and if id taken the fifty i wouldnt have to be eating your shitbag sandwich neither
jason steps back ashamed of himself
he sits down to recover
henry looks at him with a friends concern
you um you moving contraband jason
jason shakes his head no
this guy struck me as a serious problem
a few raindrops spatter the windows
jason makes for the cabin door
take care of the boat
with a grateful smile not likely to sink two of em
jason lopes along the quay toward the businesses at the far end
the sky is about to open
working behind the counter suzanne leans on her elbows chatting up a customer
jason comes through the back door
mom come on
he catches her hand and tows her toward the back door
whats wrong whats happened
we gotta go
she anxiously follows him out the door
leans back to see around the snack rack that blocked our view of him
a paper bag under his arm he goes out the front door
the rain is sheeting down
cars fishtail slightly on the grease not yet washed from the streets
reaches his car with a long stride he cant run
suzanne is driving
jason has told her
he glances at her sideways
she takes a long breath
the rain speeds up
she switches on the wipers
i should have gone through his pockets myself
it didnt occur to me
i was in such a panic
if id found the necklace jason
id have taken it too
she stops at a light
victor and alex spot suzannes car idling at the intersection
victor is eating an apple from the bag
as she accelerates suzanne reaches over to pat jasons hand
she glances in the rear view mirror
im the one who hit the bastard
a small bridge ahead is almost ready to pivot to let a boat pass
she stamps down on the gas pedal
the car rockets forward
the bridge gate is lowering
victor guns the car under the gate and across the pivoting bridge just as the gap opens
what a thrill
jasons white face is turned toward them in suzannes car
easy easy hell see us
its raining too hard
jason looking out the back window sees only the headlights and rain
still with us
maybe its just a tourist cruising around with his head up his butt
neither of them believes that
how about mexico
the sea of cortez
your father fished for marlin there
the biggest catch he ever had
sharp left she sees a side road coming up
she hangs a skidding into the turn traction holding
victor cant make the turn in time
shes not going anywhere
he brakes and calmly reverses in the rain
i just need to talk to her
last time you talked she almost crushed your skull
suzanne is driving fast
not a car in sight
the headlights turn onto the road
hears his silence and looks back herself just as he looks forward
face the road
she looks back as now bright headlights light them up
a truck horn blasts
she spins the wheel to avoid a head on but in so doing she clips the curb and loses control
she throws an arm across jason to protect him
the car rolls onto its top scraping across the road
the upside down car rips through a fence slides down off the road
the engine dies
the only sound is the spinning back tire and the windshield that now caves in
victor swerves to the side of the road
alex leaps out of the car and runs toward the wreck
victor follows at a slower pace opening his umbrella
hes still eating his apple
he sees a neighboring house light come on in response to the crash
alex is trying to open the jammed door when victor reaches him
we dont have much time
through the window they can see suzanne and jason both unconscious limbs entangled covered in glass
suzanne is hemorrhaging from a gash in her side
her leg twitches in spasm
car headlights pass by on the road
we need to get some help
already on the way im afraid
alex kicks out what remains of the back side window and slithers into the car
victor calls in after him
open the trunk please
he walks toward the back
with the car upside down alex has to reach under the seat to press the trunk release
the car is rocked far enough forward on its hood to enable the trunk to open
the contents cascade onto victor
he starts his search the apple gripped between his teeth
his own breathing noisy and shallow alex brushes the glass away from suzannes face
he lifts her shirt to see how badly shes cut and presses the heel of his hand against the gash to try to stop the bleeding
her blood spurts through his fingers
with his other hand he pats down her body
alex checks jason for her searching his limp body at the same time
i think hes okay suzanne
just tell me where it is
she cant answer
he opens the glove compartment and feels inside
he goes through her purse
leaning over the seat he fumbles with her clothes
hes trying to make her comfortable
then he reaches down her bra into her panties searching
her voice is faint
sssh i have to
dont be scared
im not going to hurt you
sirens begin to be heard closing
victor bends down next to the car
alex cmon get out of there
alex roars at victor
shes dying for chrissake
hear the sirens
just tell me where it is and let me get out of your lives
she whispers something
he leans in close
a she mumbles something indecipherable
he puts his ear close to her mouth
the sirens are bearing down
only a breath fuck you
were out of time ale
you can stay if you want but ive left
alexs feet pop out through the window
hes trying to shimmy himself backward out of the car harder than going in the principle of a lobster trap
victor grabs his ankles and pulls
alex starts to reemerge
parked down the road in a row of onlookers alex and victor watch the fire department working under portable lights pry
jason and suzanne out of the car
i didnt mean for this to happen
as soon as they see her license theyll call you in miami
he cant look away from the scene
jason is semi conscious
his eyes flutter open for a second in the dark then he sinks again
alex is half asleep in the chair his bloody clothes changed
the newspaper droops from his fingers
jasons voice cracks from disuse
what are you
he swallows painfully
alex smiles and gets up from the chair
he dreads what he has to tell him
how do you feel
wheres my mother
dodging the question i flew straight back from napa when i heard
you hit your head pretty hard
jason struggles to sit up his equilibrium not fully restored
alex sits down on the bed with him to break the news
im sorry jason
im so sorry
jason stares at him
he hasnt absorbed the fact
she didnt make it as far as the hospital
horror and rage flood jasons face
he seizes the empty i
stand and hurls it at alex who throws up his arm protectively
jason tackles alex under his guard smashing him into the metal dresser
alexs head snaps backward cracking the mirror
you killed her you fuckl alex tries to hold him eventually in a forced bear hug
dont dont i need someone in here
let go of me
alex holds him close
he collapses in alexs arms
an orderly hurries in followed by a nurse
well take care of him
alex hesitates then goes out
alex is conferring quietly with a staff member behind the counter
victor picks the lock
alex doesnt follow him inside
victor hits every spot where amateurs hide their treasures
a victors hand lifts the tub drain
b victor feels the back of a dresser
itd be nice to have some help
c victor unscrews the trap under the kitchen sink
d et cetera
alex is sitting on the stairs staring out at the gulf
he gives no indication of having heard victor
victor lays his cheek along the living room wall to eyeball it for irregularity
a smile hoists his cheeks
he pops the paneling loose
his smile collapses
the niche carved between thestuds is empty
he rests his head against the wall
alex walks down the corridor to jasons room
he taps on the door
theres no answer
he pushes open the door
the room is empty the bed stripped
alex barrels out of the room to confront the tired young doctor he sees walking down the hall
wheres my son
i released him this morning
you let an underage boy with a head injury walk out of here by himself
it was only a concussion
he said you were in the lobby
nothing to be gained alex whirls around and strides away
jason is running down the road his face contorted
jason keeps running onto the sand
he kicks off his shoes and plunges into the water and swims
swims until hes exhausted and gasping
he tips his head back in the water and screams his grief to the pitiless sky
a truck pulls over jason swings down and waves goodbye
jason appears walking down the street
he looks into the garage
seeing alexs cadillac he smiles a tight smile
jason unlocks the door and starts turning of f the alarm before the door is wide enough open to trip the delay
the lights are off
he closes the door and starts up the stairs
his hand goes into his pocket as he advances on the master bedroom
he takes out his knife
he moves toward the bed
wake up alex
i want to see your face
the sheets stir
jason raises his knife to strike
but it isnt alex in the bed its gabriella
she lets out a strangled scream
he whips the sheet off her with his other hand
her eyes on his knife dont hurt me
where is he
he went to get you
hes not coming back until tomorrow
she timidly pulls the sheet over her body
jason yanks it off her so hard it flaps loose from the corners
he touches her belly with the length of his knife the blade a flat to her skin
his cars here
its been here since he went to napa
i keep hearing about napa
did you ever call him there
she shakes her head
you dont know where he was
she swallows to clear her voice
her eyes havent left the knife
why would he lie to me
ever so lightly jasons fingertips find her skin
you didnt waste any time
you moved right in
you dont need the knife
the knife down
she knows men and children well enough to demand not beg
jason has almost forgotten he still
has the knife against her
he lifts it and folds it and puts it away
im going to wait for him and
im going to kill him
his hand drifts along her body
she doesnt resist
theyll lock you up
away from the sky and the air and the sea and the current running against the wind
that was a very beautiful letter
jason moves onto the bed on his knees
did you show it to him
you two have a laugh about it
i never mentioned itl jasons hand curves around her throat
a caress a threat
did you tell him how to find us
gabriella knocks his hand away from her throat
not he wasnt interested he didnt care
sure he did
he was glad she left
jason lies down alongside her
he had us followed
he shrugs he doesnt trust her
how do you know
she thinks grief has driven him crazy and he sees that
im not crazy
gabriella lays her hand over his on the bed to comfort him
im so very sorry about what happened to your mother
his hand skitters away and lights on her ribs
her loss your gain
furious gabriella forgets her caution
she slaps him hard enough to throw his head sideways
jason rolls on top of her and pins her down
her home her bed her life
he lowers his mouth to gabriellas neck
his kiss is surprisingly gentle
his knee works her legs apart
dont do this for revenge
lets finish what we started
slowly he kisses her
she lets her mouth respond a sweet kiss in spite of the circumstances
his fingers scissor her nipple
just dont tell me that you love me
he peels off his t shirt
in a whisper i love you
he gives her a hard look
she holds his gaze and pushes his jeans down until he finally kicks them off and theyre both naked
they begin to make love
jason doesnt understand
she gently pushes him back
she turns on her stomach and guides him back into her
jason moves now rapidly
her hand on his ass guides the pace
she hasnt had a young man in a long time
what are you doing to me
dont come not yet
they move as one their passion enveloping them
he makes her come first
then when her boay flattens he also comes and hes lying on top of her his face alongside hers their breath gentling
finally they lie side
will you get me a towel
with warm water
he kisses her and gets up
if she didnt love him before she does now
while he runs the water towarm it he looks at himself naked in the mirror
his face crumples
he no longer knows what hes doing
he brings the towel back to gabriella who wipes herself
her mood too has sobered
after a moment are you going to kill me too
youll have to
ill be a witness
ill know you planned it
would you do that
i like you too much to let you kill him
jasonstarts to put on his clothes i need him jason
you dont you dont
im not going back to caracas
you dont know how we live there
she pulls the pillow in front of her to hide her nakedness
he touches her shoulder she shrugs him away
you have to leave now jason
what are you talking about
this is my home
she stares at him
his face is set
she cant persuade him
jason thinks of his next step a plan
this is not your room though is it
jason starts toward the door
youre never going to marry him gabriella
he closes the door with a solid click
she starts to cry and still crying she pulls the sheets off the bed she has to change the sheets
jason leans against the wall his eyes squeezed shut listening to her cry
alex carries his suitcase toward the condo
alex puts his key in the lock opens the door
as he goes in gabby
alex is too astonished to say a word
jason and gabriella are having lunch at the kitchen table
alex sets down his suitcase
ive been looking for you for two days
jason relishes this
you shouldve called home
howd you get here
too bright and are you hungry
have you had lunch
alex doesnt even hear her
why didnt you wait for me
jason eats without answering
and what about all your stuff and your mothers
jason swallows wipes his mouth
she doesnt need it anymore and i dont want it
gabriella brings alex a cup of coffee
how about a sandwich
im not hungry
you havent even said hello to her
with great control hello gabby
did you miss me honey
what are you doing
jason gets up from the table
hes wearing workout clothes
he walks out of the condo
alex and gabriella are left alone together
she jumps in before he can say anything
he just lost his mother alex
you cant expect him to act normal
he steps up beside her and moves her hair off her shoulders
did you try to make him feel better
right back at him yes
i gave him sonlething to eat
she walks out and up the stairs to the bedroom
alex comes into the room
shes sitting on the bed
i feel like i made her die
alex sits down beside her and takes her hand
i wanted her to go away so bad
i used to wish shed die
and then she did
he lets go of her hand
i dont need two children in the house
noticing her mouth what happened to your mouth
gabriellas hand jumps to her lip
i bit my lip
he takes her lip between his and nuzzles it
she tries to laugh and nods
he holds her close
whered jason go
jason is working out alone in the little gym when in the mirror he sees alex come through the door
he keeps lifting
alex sits down on the bench beside him
jason ignores him
you have something that belongs to me jason and i want it back
its not yours
jason continues to lift
finally did you know the things worth over a million dollars
what a fucking stupid way to spend money
i was holding it for someone
these are dangerous people
the bar wobbles with jasons laugh
alex moves behind and spots him unnecessarily
dont screw around with me jason
hes in a position to crush jasons windpipe
jason shoves the barbell up in his face finishing the set and re racking
he reaches for his towel and wipes his face his expression hidden
i dont know where it is anymore
you killed the only person who did
it was an accident
what did i have to do with it
jason wads up his towel and throws it at alex
there was a car following us
did you see who was in it
jason shakes his head no
i met one of these guys
tall weird looking fucker with
a gray crew cut
letting out a breath these people you dont steal from
whoever was following suzanne is going to come after you too
havent you figured that out
for the first time jason wavers
its a plausible alternative but one that makes him guilty instead
who are they
alex fastidiously drops the towel in the hamper
give the necklace back to me and well split the handling commission
his ingratiating smile offends jason
he doesnt trust alex
he shakes his head
she never told me where she kept it
alex doesnt believe him either
rests on a dumbbell and for a murderous instant hes about to pick it up and use it on jason
he lifts his hand away
victor is lying on his bed the respirator beside him while he talks on the phone to alex
he looks dreadful
nice boy like that the money means diddlyshit
and personally i suspect hed rather die than tell you
so get a blowtorch and use it on the girl until he cooperates
alex sits hunched over the desk the phone in his hand thinking
just as an example alex
hes gonna make a move
when he does ill be there
he hangs up and rocks back in his chair
victor attaches his mask breathes in oxygen
he turns off the light
his breathing deepens
gabriella has already gone to bed
the lights are off
alex slides into bed beside her with a soft groan
he reaches for her comfort
muffled against her im never leaving you again
he starts to caress her
im already asleep honey
she realizes he isnt going away
she rolls onto her back
her arms go around him
alex kisses her long and deep
can he hear us
alexs tone turns
jason is causing him another problem
i think hes probably figured out why we sleep in the same bed gabby
he misses his mother
so do i
gabriella props herself up on her elbow
i wish she was alive and happy and someplace else
gabriella lies down again and makes herself comfortable against him
he tries again to interest her body
we need to go somewhere just us
im buying a vineyard in france
have you ever been to paris
she rolls onto her stomach indirectly blocking his frontal exploration
alex scoots down next to her his hand takes possession of her ass
well stay at the ritz well eat our way through every three star restaurant in town a new dress every night would you like that
gabriella laughs in wonder and turns onto her side to face him
they fit themselves together like an old married couple
getting caught up in his own fantasy well drive down through burgundy follow the rhone into provence wind up on the riviera monte carlo princess stephanie
he gives a rueful laugh shes younger than he easily remembers
they have tables at the casino where you play baccarat and the bets start at a hundred bucks
with a chuckle you wont be able to afford it
youll have spent all your money on my clothes and my jewelry
slipping her leg ohl remember dinas necklace
alexs eyes go cold and watchful although she doesnt notice
ill wear something like that and then if you lose you can throw it on the table to cover your bet like james bond
james had an expense account
he rolls onto his back she lays her cheek on his graying chest
he no longer wants to make love
what made you think of the necklace
shes drifting toward sleep
i looked good in it didnt i
he pats her shoulder without answering
he wont sleep for a while
flaps away with a screech that startles us
is walking along the docks
he turns suddenly
victor melts into the doorway of a shed but not before jason has glimpsed him
jason walks faster
a couple of fishermen he knows call out greetings
he hops onto a docked boat
jason jumps from boat to boat
he pushes them apart so he cant be followed
when he leaps ashore again he has shaken victor
or so it seems
gabriella answers the phone
jasonson a pay phone
into the phone come meet me i gotta talk to you
im at the haitian marketplace
you know where it is
i cant just what am i going to tell him
an thing you want
dont drive take a cab as she laughs at what sounds like silliness ill wait for you
jason hangs up
he looks around
he doesnt see victor watching from the trinket stand
be walks to the counter where he has already ordered coffee and pie
he picks up his fork
he cant eat
theres a folded newspaper left behind by another customer
he pulls it over
he doesnt even hear her
gabriella goes out the door
foot up on the lowest crossbar of the balcony railing alex leans on his crossed arms and watches her step into a cab
gabriella waves to him
gabriella walks through the stalls looking for jason and spies him at the counter
the paper is folded beside him
she sits down next to him
here i am
what is it
do you know how much a cab costs
i saw a guy following me
i thought you werent safe
i was going to tell you to go stay at your she starts to swivel off the stool to leave
he grabs her hand
im so sick of this
youd say anything
he hands her the newspaper
at the bottom of the page reads duchess of windsor jewels stolen from socialite with a picture of the duchess herself in her glory days necklace around her throat
reads the headline and starts to laugh
there is such a thing as justicel dinas necklace
couldnt happen to a better person
alex stole it
you really hate him
the reason i know is because i stole it from him
her eyes widen
his face concealed among the candles is trying to figure out what drama is going on between jason and gabriella
he can read their faces but not their lips
thats why he went out with me
he was trying to use me
the thought hits her theyll think im part of it
the maid who got fired
you werent a maid
what difference does it make
were going to the gulf
he throws money down for the check
jason guns the motorcycle into the street gabriella holds him tight
victors car merges into traffic several cars behind them
victor is enjoying himself a bit
he fiddles with the radio finds music he likes
the radio music playing victor weaves through traffic
he keeps the motorcycle in sight
jason checks in his mirrors
he catches sight of victors car the same one that was following his mother
gabriella nuzzles his neck
victor makes a face he thinks he has been spotted
jason is getting harder to follow
the music ends an announcer describes what it was gives the time
theres a beep
the news theme starts up
on the hour every hour we give you all the news you need
the announcer continues with the lead stories including the recently discovered jewel theft
jason jams the motorcycle toward us past us
behind victors car suddenly squeals through a u turn
the shutters have been closed alex is lying on the couch in the dark having a nap
hes awakened by a nasty wheeze
victor is standing over him
a man with your breeding usually rings the doorbell
there was is no time
you heard the news
victor pulls one of alexs golf clubs out of the bag as though to admire it
i know you keep money here somewhere
give it to me
alex spreads out his hands
vic vic the golf club catches him in the midsection
alex cries out
the blow folds him forward onto his knees
cops are about to drive up your street
he brings the club down on alexs bare foot
through teeth clenched theres nothing here to
where is it
he clips alex on the other leg as he tries to crawl away
the physical effort shortens victors breathing
his cough sprays blood
he tightens his grip on the club
believe me i swear to god i victor raises the club over alexs head and brings it down on the coffee table instead
the glass explodes
he has to push the words out through aacoughing spasm
i refuse to die in a fucking prison clinic
alex staggers to his feet
victor is struggling for breath
alex jerks the golf club away from him and tosses it on the floor
he puts his arm around victors waist and helps him to the sofa
come on this is pitiful
victor drops onto the sofa
he gags on the blood in his throat and desperately draws in air
what a mess
he picks up a sofa pillow to arrange it for him
victor gives him a grateful smile
alex presses the pillow down over his face before he can react
his feet flail
alex has to lie on top of him to hold him down
a couple making out on the couch
the gun thumps to the floor
victors movements slow and stop
alex takes no chances
he keeps the pillow jammed down until theres no possibility of trickery
satisfied he rolls victors dead body onto the floor steps over it and with steady hands he opens a bottle of very expensive wine
he pours a glass
at least you got to die in your own clothes vic
a few truckers make remarks as gabriella walks toward the bank of phones
hey pretty lady
shes not your type
she doesnt mind swinging her hips a little for their benefit
the phone is ringing
alex sits in a chair in the dark
then he crosses to the phone picks it up and waits for the caller to speak
gabriella is watching for jason
intercut as needed
into the phone im with him
what took you so long
he has a boat alex
its on the boat
the dumb shit wants to turn it over to the cops
you know whatll happen to me
alex is taking his passport out of his desk
just tell me how to find you
he opens another drawer
theres a gun inside
jason comes out of the mens room
he doesnt see gabriella for a moment
a couple of truckers block his view
now he catches sight of her
shes coming from the direction of the phones a can of soda in her hand
their eyes meet
she smiles and waves the can hurries to meet h m
the motorcycle cruises up the coast road
the surf glows with plankton
presses her cheek against jasons back
jason secures the motorcycle
he puts his arm around gabriella they walk down the dock to his boat
he helps her aboard
henry emerges from the cabin
he eyes gabriella
this is gabriella
shes my contraband
she looks quickly at jason who smiles
henry reaches out to shake her hand
kids a sucker for dark skin
gabriella and jason tenderly make love in the swaying cabin
on watch henry finds his gaze sliding to the noisy dockside bar its beer sign beacon bright
the sounds below embarrass him
he makes up his mind
he swings off the boat and heads toward the bar
he doesnt notice alexs cadillac idling in the alley
the headlights click off the motor goes silent
the boats creak against the slips
jason wakes up with a start
he senses something
he slides out from under the sleeping weight of gabriellas arm and pulls on his jeans reaches up to open the cabin hatch
alexs foot swinging
more of him comes into sight as jason climbs to deck
the financial pages open on his lap hes drinking a styrofoam cup of coffee and eating a donut the rest of the bag of donuts is next to him
i brought donuts
jason is struck silent
he sits down on the side of the boat his arms around his ribs
oh its not as bad as all that
she fucking called you
she has some residual loyalty yeah
which i didnt expect either
jason moves to the helm switches on the engine
alex quickly finishes his donut
he brushes off his fingers
where are we going
im going fishing
get off if you want
no its a beautiful day for a boat ride
give us a chance to talk
he makes himself comfortable
then make yourself useful and cast off the stern line
alex moves to the stern while jason casts off the bow line
theres not a lot of choice
alex casts off
jason backs the boat into position
he sees henry asleep in the doorway of the marine supplies store next to the shuttered bar
alex rejoins him
if we could manage to ignore the personal history here i think we could work something out between us
jason turns the boat toward the open sea
you want gabriella
this is the way to have her
life costs jason
and you love her more than i do
as jason glances at so stake yourself to a life together
give her what she needs before jason does hi honey
gabriella comes up onto deck
she glances bewildered at the ocean around them
why are we shut up
just shut up
she sits on the bench her face tight and angry
hes feeling like you let him down
she gives alex a look that silences him
he reaches for another donut
the sounds of the engine and the hull hitting the waves substitute for conversation
jason finishes setting the lines
im ready to listen
he sits down beside a pole and looks over at gabriella who has put on a hat
shes staring out to sea
alex wants to make me an offer
she gives no sign of having heard him
were giving you a hard choice gabby
two rich men
gabriella swivels her head slowly
i dont want either one of you
a line quivers
jason reels in a little
somethings going to bite just his biceps tightening now
and the bait is taken at the moment he said
the line reels out very very fast
he lets the fish run with it
gabriella has turned around to watch
now jason reels in a little making the line taut testing the weight
he yanks back
the line rises from the ocean bringing to the surface a big dark green fish
what the hell is that
jason plays the shark until its close to the boat and thrashing for its life
help him alex
id just get in his way
his hand comes to rest on her shoulder as jason expertly reels in the bucking hammerhead
she shrugs away from his hand
jason has hooked a ten foot three finned sea beast with a spade shaped head and black eyes on each side
he attaches the line to a winch and winds it up onto the deck
it twists wildly knocking things over until it slows down and finally lies very still
his chest heaving with the effort jason looks around
alex has disappeared without either of them noticing
alex is searching frantically
alex whirls around
his gun materializes in his hand
jason retreats a step
is this your backup plan
you want it so bad its yours
he pulls out the necklace and hurls it away from alex
you little prick
skitters along the deck
the sharks body stops it from dropping out the open gate in the transom
scrambles toward the necklace
dont let him have it
hell kill jason grabs her and holds her with both arms to keep her from going any closer
alex turns his head puzzled warned
the shark suddenly thrashes its jaws snapping around him
gabriella screams with alex
he fires his gun over and over until its empty
the shark continues to tear at him
help me help
gabriella runs down into the cabin
much as he hates alex jason cant let him die
forward and straddles the shark jams the blade of his knife into the primordial brain
he twists the handle once
the shark dies instantly
trembling with adrenalin jason gets off its back
with his elbows alex drags himself out of the jaws
hes badly mangled
the shark slowly changes color to a dull brown
you knew it wasnt dead
jason squats down beside him to access his injuries
mom didnt take the necklace
alex struggles to stay conscious
then you killed her yourself
jason slowly nods
and you were in the car behind us
gabriella drops down beside them
she has a flare gun no longer needed and sheets from the cabin to stop the bleeding
she starts to tear them up
shes crying slightly
we were supposed to turn him ini i didnt think you were going to kill him
well i didnt
alex manages to laugh
you set me up
you had her call me
i believed you
jason pushes to his feet and heads for the cockpit
ill get on the radio
gabriella wraps the strips of sheet tightly around whats left of alex to bandage
she smears away the tears so she can see and leaves blood tracked across her face
she looks down to see his bloody hand clutching the necklace
they look at each other
has the microphone in his hand
hes setting course
gabriella appears behind him
shes holding the flare gun
she puts it back where she found it and steps beside him and puts her arm around his waist
he lays his arm over her shoulders and holds her close while he uses the radio
this is hercules ii calling the harbormaster
the boat heads back to port
at an unused pier gabriella leans back against the line to hold the boat in place
henry and jason carry alex off the boat and lay him on the planks
sirens can be faintly heard
jason leaps back on the boat
henry pushes them off
i will be
he and jason wave goodbye
the boat moves out
henry is left with alex
weakly to henry whats your name
no way still the salesman no listen listen this is worth a fortune
thrusting the necklace play the possibilities
and he walks away fast
wait dont go
come back here
come on back
alex rolls onto his belly and starts dragging himself down the dock too much of an optimist to give up hope in a hopeless situation
