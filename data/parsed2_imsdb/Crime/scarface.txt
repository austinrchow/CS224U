in may fidel castro in an effort to normalize relations with the carter administration opened the harbor at mariel cuba with the apparent intention of letting some of his people
join their relatives in the united states
within seventy two hours u
boats were headed for cuba
in the next few weeks it became evident that castro was forcing the boat owners to carry back with them not only their relatives but the dregs of his jail
y the time the port was closed marielitos had landed in florida

the prologue is shredded diagonally by the blade of a stilleto and in the empty black void we opening montage documentary footage from the harbor in mariel cuba
vessels of every nature waving masses demonstrations

the flag of the united states
choppers swooping over the ragged coastline of the keys
emerald waters dotted with fishing trawlers and pleasure craft an america the beautiful type immigration theme surging over this

babies bawling arguments over paperwork refugees being interviewed by tv news people crying people eating families huddled on floors
the music theme continuing in stately calm as we and closeup of tony montana ant the scar faced one in the young angry prime of his life
we dwell first on the scar which he likes to scratch now and then
we move to the eyes pure in their fury

inflict or receive either one

the rag tag audience is noisily yammering back at the screen the camera moving past manny ray chewing gum hair slicked eyes in cat like repose
to tony enrapt eyes like an eleven year old mouth hanging open

proclamation in graffiti

tony five minutes later in a phone booth in the middle of a bank of them dozens of marielietos pressing to get in trying still to contact somebody anybody on
tony is dialing his eyes shifting down to the telephone number written in pencil on the back of a snapshot as he finishes the number he flips the snapshot over
and we see a young girl about thirteen years old dark tiny fiery standing together with a dog and tony early twenties in shadow the fringes of the photo heavily tattered with handling
tony stares at it his mind drifting as the phone rings in a distant place
a brief moment of repose we have not yet seen in tony
someone picks up the phone
an older womans voice
his expression alters to uncertainty
who is this
tony changes his mind hangs up
the faces of those in line peer in the next party raps on the door but tony ignores it slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his pants then
at his own pace exits the phone booth
he walks a few beats his eyes pensive
then recognizes somebody in another phone booth and goes over
angel frenandez has got the face of one as he argues on the phone then hangs up a desolate look on his face a worn phone book in his hand

as rebenga in long lensed closeup nervously smokes a cigarette eyes roving as the guard examines his papers
the visuals are swift dispassionate and documentary like
the refugees storm the barbed wire at the main gate carrying bricks and wooden slats
in unison libertad
form ranks outside
flee through a hole in the fence
move on them wielding clubs

on chains are glimpsed
throw stones and debris from the rooftop of a barrack
nervously hurries a cigarette in his mouth into a barrack
tracks him signals
are pulling apart their beds going for the wooden slats
others set fire to their mattresses
are moving through the gates restoring order
injured refugees lie bleeding on the grounds
now goes up in flames
a bewildered emilio rebenga grabs his papers and valuables
manny runs up on him
rebenga sees him senses danger flees down the aisle with his satchel intersecting other panicked refugees
rebenga stumbles into a bed frame shatters his glasses then runs on
into the smoke and flame
out of which scarface now appears in his killing wrath
of the voice
rebenga snaps to the sound spanish from the friends you fucked
the work is fast
the stiletto punches nine quick holes in his lungs and his heart
and the figure of death is gone
and emilio rebenga staggers wildly in the smoke uncompre hending eyes encased in broken glasses sinking out of frame
the riot is over
the grounds are still smoke and debris the aftermath
an immigration officer passes a sheaf of documents across a desk into a pair of hands
the camera gliding along a green card pinned to the top of the stack
it says anthony montana and it has picture and stamps
its official as the camera moves with triumphant immigration theme music
to the face of mr
montana examining quite contentedly the rewards of his efforts

pointing to a tall cool blonde across the avenue

out his arm and stopping traffic
cars honk angrily but he couldnt give a shit
manny follows as tony now moves across the opposite lane a car screeching to a halt in front of him

the blonde has paused to look in a shop window
manny stops alongside pretends to look
when he catches her eyes he flicks his tongue
she looks at him confused then back into the window
manny look back at tony winks sidles closer to her
tony waiting off to the side catches the gaze of a somber child four toddling along with itsmom
be makes his own version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at him puzzled
tony produces another face
the kid now smiles
the mother looks over
she smiles and moves along
meanwhile manny has moved close to the blonde and suggests something his eyebrows raising the smile crooked
it takes a moment then the blonde smacks him across the face and walks away
tony walks over to him mocking

the parking lot is crammed with moby dick size cars and casual cubans in sports clothes bunched in conversations around their wheels or at the ice cream stand
the inside is a brightly lit glitterdome with fancy mirrors and chandelier effects spanish in influence and every it combines the social functions of a table is taken
family restaurant cafe tourist haunt and late night watering hole for various beasts of prey
the waitresses move like well oiled troops along the paths to the kitchen turning the tables at a speedy rate
the camera following past the pots and the pans and the steam and the yelling cooks to the deepest darkest recess of this dungeon
to reveal tony montana stubbing grease off the pots and manny ray washing a stack of dishes
theyre filthy and exhausted
a dish slips through mannys fingers and crashes to the floor
a look between them suffices to tell us all

tony turns down the salsa beat on the radio smoking a cigarette tensely

reflecting the tension whistles a vapid series of manw notes under his breath as he waits for a light to change

as manny pulls the car up they pull out ingram model machine pistol with folding butt and suppressor ten inches of kill power capable of firing rounds a minute it
into a mans purse its in vogue
tony can be slipped gettting out to angel lets go
tony and angel come slowly gingerly down an exterior corridor to a room marked
nodding to angel who xl remains in the stairwell with the ingram machine pistol tony knocks
the doors opened casually by an ugly squat five foot four inch columbian the toad
hes in his forties sports shirt hanging over his polyester pants old acne scars on his face like omar hes good natured a nice guy he smiles
hey oye amigo
spreading his arms in such a fashion to indicate hes clean
tony stepping into the conventionally tasteless orange and blue motel room with heavy blue drapes blocking the windows spreads his hands in a similar posture inducating he too is not
carrying but this is only symbolic its not meant to be a body search
as he steps in how you doing amigo
the other person in the room is a tough looking little dark columbian chick with expressionless eyes red fingernails and short boy cut hair the lizard shes tinier than the
toad about five two
the toad looks around the corridor eases the door closed
checking out the room mind leaving the door open so my brothers know everythings okay
toad shrugs and readjusts leaving it open a few inches the conversation clipped and nervous throughout the scene
this is marta
sure no s continued hello marta
she nods woodenly stays across the room
behind her the television set is on to the cable newswatch
the protagonists intermittently flick their eyes to it soothing the tension
so omar says youre okay
yeah omars okay

omar yeah i talk to him on the phone
so you got the money

tony paces back towards the door casually check angel out
the lizard staring at him
everthing seems okay
so what do we do walk in and start over
change subject where you from
tonys eyes check out the bathroom
what fuckin difference does it make where im from
i like to get to know who i do business with
its like hes stalling for time
the lizard has made a move somewhere off center andis now sitting on the bed coiled and always watching
you get to know me when you start doing business and not fucking around hector
hey im just a friendly guy maybe you dont
okay whats the stall here
your guy late or something
theres suddenly a door slamming somewhere outside then commotion
tony goes for his cheap handgun when he hears a frightening female shriek like a bird
slang spanish dont
shes standing there with a
pointed steady at him the eyes like angry steel
theres no mistaking her ability to shoot
the toad pulls a mm out of the small of his back approaches tony
angel is shoved into the room followed by two more columbians the kids
they slam the door both carrying uzis with silencers neither of them higher than five four xl or older than twenty with their straight black indian hair cut across their
blank eyes they look like hungry little pirranha careless about killing muttering with the lizard in fast columbese slang
as toad strips the handgun from tony frog face you just fucked up
you steal from me youre dead
toad shrugs he couldnt care less
yeah okay you gonna give me the cash or am i gonna kill your brother first
fore i kill you
try sticking your head up your ass
see if it fits
toad completing the body search rips out the stiletto taped to the small of tonys back
as he mutters something in hard columbian slang to the two kids who shove angel into the bathroom producing strands of thick rope
even more worrisome is the chainsaw that the lizard now pull out of the suitcase under the bed
toad begin assembling it as lizard still covering tonywith her gun completes the deadpan process by turning up the volume on the television set
the news not ironically in miami is about a drug related triple homicide
chi chi sitting at the wheel of the sedan parked across the street
manny paces outside the car glances
a small woman the lizard steps out in shadow in the parking lot of the sun ray across the street looks around sees nothing casually goes back in
manny looks at his watch
angel hangs suspended on the ropes from the top of the shower curtain bar his legs straddling the edge of the bathtub
toad slaps a tape over his mouth
tony coverd by the two kids watches from the lip of the bathroom
he bucks angrily but the two kids ram their pistols up against his temple and pin him to the door
angel looks at tony the eyes between them steady
theyre dead and they know it
toad well prepared connects a voltage adapter and extension cord
to tony you watch what happens to your friend okay
if you dont want this to happen to you you get the money
lizard reenters the room shakes her head at the toad who nods and turns on the whirring machine
the toad smiles amiably and angles the chainsaw slowly towards angel
the two kids press tight against tony guns pointed at his brains
we know whats happening as we hear the chainsaw and we watch tonys shock and rage
no expression lizard has on her face
the machine cuts off
the toad steps back from the tub blood splattered on his shirt examjning his first cut like a butcher
he glances at tony
now the leg hunh
a brief glimpse of angel slumped by one arm like a cow on a strap streaming blood eyes conscious and horrified a terrifying sight
the chainsaw whirrs once more
manny definitely suspecting something now moves with chi chi across the parking lot of the sun ray motel
they signal and separate
the toad turns off the chainsaw and steps back now drenched with angels blood totally unaffected
he looks at tony
tony glances back at him with fury tears involuntarily dotting his eyes
okay my caracortada you can die too
makes no difference to me
the kids shove tony forward and we glimpse angel lying hunkered at his feet in the bathtub in the steam of his blood piss dead
manny moves crouched down the exterior corridor ingram pistol in hand past an older couple who pretend not to notice
at the door of room manny waits listens
the kids are starting to strap tony up to the top of the shower
the lizard watches from the lip of the bathroom impassively
last chance carajo
tony devastated spits in his face
go fuck yourself
toads eyes narrow meanly
kid one slaps the tape across tonys mouth
kid two reaches up to tighten the overhead strap to tonys wrist
the toad turns on his chainsaw when suddenly theres a gunshot from the hall
and the door smashes open and manny barrels through and shoots a surprised lizard as she raises her pistol
she crashes backwards into the room wounded
everything happens very fast now
manny is at the lip of the bathroom he fires and hits kid one who is turning in the neck
tony not tied up yet spins on kid two and smashes the unloosened strap across his face sending him reeling across the bathroom
the toad chainsaw in hand slashes at manny
manny fires a burst into him and the toad crashes backwards
manny now spins into a wall hit in the side
the lizard wounded on her knees is firing her
in b g
the window simultaneously blows out as chi chi appears firing a burst with his ingram
in sharp f g
the lizard crumples forward on her knees foaming blood
tony with the tape still stuck across his mouth smashes kid two pinned against the blood stained sink with the stock of his own ingram
in the midst of this the toad jumps up wounded but with strength he tears out the motel room door hysterical gripping the whirring chainsaw in a reflex action
c nt nued chi chi climbing through the window fires at him
meanwhile kid two with a rattlesnake life in him produces a knife out of nowhere just missing tonys gut by a half second as tony dances back getting a grip
on the machine pistol
he blows kid two away point blank putting another ten craters in the mirror of the now wrecked motel room
tony yelling whirls after the toad
i got him
manny holding his side empties his pistol on kid one who is still twitching
chi chi sees angel gags
the senior citizens playing mah jorigg on the porch mutter in astonishment
as the toad staggers out into the parking lot blood flying chainsaw in hand moving like a jerky chicken
their eyes follow
as tony comes out walking after him deliberately eyes set in cold fury machine gun swinging loosely at his side
theres no rush no fear of the police getting even is all that counts
he stands behind the toad
spanish yourturn cabron
the toad whips around to the voice eyes stark with terror
tony empties the clip into the toad blowing hiin apart
the bystanders just stare stunned by the ferocity
then an old lady faints
the toads body lying awkwardly arched in the gutter tony turns and with a passing disinterested glimpse at his audience calmly walks back into the motel the distance and the
light sufficient to conceal tonys possible identi fication
u tony intersects holding side manny his with chi chi

and a hefty indian looking bodyguard ernie eyes quietly trained like a doberman pinscher
the boss frank lopez comes down a carpeted corridor dressed for dinner in an expensive suit and shoes somewhat preoccupied as he greets tony then max my with a phony
effusion of warmth

down the driveway
single girls in high collared silver lame jumpsuits with cinched waists prowl like big glistening tents back and forth across the entry doors rich young coiffed playboys in their porsches
honking their horns in appreciation

rich young guys with a lot of gold and diamonds on their necks and hands huddle briefly in groups or chat
down at the vid games are younger chicks in jeans and tough looking tank tops with motherfuckah and fuck me written on them

the interior is comprised of small narrow rooms filled with religious objects from macumba and waist high black jesus statues in various corners
the floor is without rugs and mosaicked with inexpensive aztec type tiles the impression clean cluttered catholic somewhat depressing
stepping forward to the center of the living room like a cautious cat is his ninteen year old sister gina
their eyes lock
moved hi gina
she looks at her mother confused
shes a naturally dark curly headed beauty with a slim graceful figure and large lidded eyes brimming with the same energy as tonys

tony spruce in his new three piece suit with the diamond on the finger and the expensive watch looks like the young ethnic american businessman in import export as he
steps in front of a chunky young customs officer who looks at him coldly
mind opening that sir
tony calm unzips the chic leather single suitcase his eyes drifting around
a woman with a child and toy panda in a baby carriage is cursorily checked through an adjacent line
a nun is waived through the third line
a stockbroker waiting in a fourth line glances nervously xl in tonys direction

he waits confident

subtitle appears alejandro sosa is a playboy about six foot two black wavy hair athletic body and a copacabana tan the clothes a casual polo shirt and the latest pants
from calvin klein
on his wrist is a flashy gold id bracelet with alex written in diamonds and on the other wrist a gold rolex with a bezel full of diamonds worth maybe
his eyes fizzle with an energy derived not from drugs but the continual excitement of his toys and his money
accompanying him everywhere is the shadow a thin intense venomous looking hispanic man in his thirties he has the look of death in an unsmiling face
he is always in proximity to his jefe usually slightly behind the person or persons addressing sosa in a sort of garotte position his eyes swivelling to stare down the
person who might glance at him
he is a continual source of tension underplaying the scenes particularly coming to affect omar who is insecure to begin with
sosa is showing tony and omar through his coke processing lab past four coal fired stoves each with mas sive iron kettles bubbling with coca paste
across to a row of ovens where the refined coke dries
the chemists and indians working there all acknowledge llel rey de rey as he passes as proud of his factory as a vine grower his vineyard
so this and my other factory can a guarantee production of kilos refined every month of the year
problem is i have no steady market
some months i cant get rid of fifty keys other months i have to do to keys its crazy hunh
nobody can run a business that way i know what you mean mr
sosa we got the same problems up in miami the demand varies for us too month to month
sosa looks at him like thats obvious and moves on
in his skinny suit with the wet cigarette clamped between his nervous fingers omars not quite in his league with sosa
tow awed by the scope of it all follows along stops to look at a sample of the dried coke
the shadow stops eyeballs him
tony eyeballs him back playing a game with him then samples the coke off his thumb into his nose
his expression says i like it
he moves on
the shadow moves with him
meanwhile basically what im looking for is somebody to share the risks with me somebody in the states who might guarantee me something like
say kilos a month
thats a big commitment mr

you sure got good stuff in there mr
sosa class a shit
looking over the laboratory like it was his
omar glances at him annoyed
well talk at my house
shall we go
the camera moves past a spectacular view of the mountains to a cavernous dining room highlighted by huge paintings from the spanish classical period and ornate candelabra
at the table are sosa omar tony
the shadow sits impas sively in a folding chair off to the side watching omar and tony
tony is impressed looking at the plates the glasses the silverware uncomfortable trying to fit in
he eats the salmon off a silver plate with oafish movements of his knife and fork as the servants move to and fro con stantly changing dishes confusing tony ad
lib during scene
to omar say lopez guarantees me keys a month for a year and he picks it up down here i could sell it to him for as little as a
you cannot do better than that
c nt nued well we do that we gotta take the risk of moving it

they got frogmen they got ec s with satellite tracking shit in em they got fuckin bell assault choppers up the ass were losing one out of every nine loads
its no duckwalk for us anymore yknow
omar is looking at him ready to explode at his blithe assumption of power whereas sosa chuckles amused by his brashness starting to be intrigued by this animal
what do you suggest is a fair
interrupted sosa looks over at his black aide who suddenly appears at the door apparently with a message
sosa waves him in
the black aide y the skull is a slim tall imposing man with academic horn rimmed glasses and close cropped hair on a huge and impressive skull
he combines the physical qualities of an animal with an intellectual
as he approaches he glances down the table his eyes falling briefly on omar who doesnt connect
the skull falters just for a moment then continues towards sosa with the same stony loyal expression
sosa lends his ear and the skull whispers his information
he whispers a second thought
sosa reacts minimally
then he nods dismissing the skull who heads out the room
sosa glances at his gold rolex
meanwhilzz tony in a whisper shaddup willya montana im doing the talking here
where were we
youre looking for a partner right
omar shoots a poisonous glance at tony
something like that
chuckles look mr
sosa were getting ahead of ourselves here
im down on franks authority to buy keys thats it thats my limit
i got no right to negotiate for frank lopez on anything larger than that
so why dont we
hey omar why dont you let the man finish hunh
let him propose his proposition
hey montana you got no authority here okay
i started you in this business all right so shut the fuck uq
shrugs frank love it

he looks embarrassed at sosa who has been watching sensing also an advantage in the split
im sorry about this mr

ir a beat i dont think this is something okay
i want to do on an overseas
phone but i can go back to miami and talk to frank personally
without hesitation good

omar is taken aback by the omafi i yeah i guess so
glancing at tony to omar leave your friend here
while youre gone maybe he can tell me how to run business
it i dont think that
lighting a cigar hey its okay
you tell frank im keeping this guy on ice for him
l the helicopter blades whirr
the skull waits inside with the shadow
they both stare at omar who with one hesitant look steps inside
the chopper lifts off the lawn the camera moving to the polo players exercising in the distance
a woman on a horse rides by and we swing with her towards the villa
sosa walks tony down an outside gallery towards the veranda where servants lay out the coffee and fruits
you know why they say cubans are all screwed up
cause the islands in the caribbean the governments in russia the armys in angola and the people live in miami
they reach the veranda tony glancing past sosa to an exotic looking dark eyed senorita who gets off her horse held by a servant and joins them
overlapping the joke they got a beard there thats all
with a cigar and a big mouth
maybe hell move to miami too
gabriella my rose how was the ride
xl sosa changes his personality completely with her dewy eyed and loving
they peck each others cheek lightly
distracted xl lovely
but the sheep in the north pasture theyre destroying the grass its turning yellow
you must move them darling
take care of it myself
turning to and dont forget we have the rinaldis at eight
of course not
uh an associate of mine
to tony my fiance gabriella montini
she nods to him in that somewhat uninterested rude tx upperclass latin way
tx its a pleasure
tx she withdraws
tony watches her go
i gotta hand it to you
you got everything a man could want
sosa pleased reaches for an expensive set of binoculars on the patio table looks up through them at the heli copter rising off the lawn
focusing the binoculars i like you tony
theres no lying in you
unfortunately i dont feel the same way about the rest of your organization
tony glances up at the chopper the servant pouring coffee for him
in l whaddaya getting at mr
i mean omar suarez
puzzled glances up at the chopper which now hovers tony there high above the estate
sosa passes him the binoculars
this garbage was recognized by my from several associate at lunch
in new york
he was an years ago
informer for the police
tony astonished looks up
terrified being positioned at the door of the chopper by the shadow and the skull his hands tied to his back and a he is length of thick rope looped
around his neck
struggling backwards in vain
he put vito duval and the ramos brothers nello and gino away for life
my associate used to work up there
through the binoculars they throw omar out of the chopper and he flies downwards and jerks back up as the he hangs there like rope stretches taut snapping his neck
a broken doll on a string as the chopper moves out of sight
sosa watches him closely shaken lowers the binoculars
tony looks back at him contemplative
for his reaction
sosa goes over pours himself some coffee
so how do i know youre not a chivato too tony
stalks awry up to him sosa get this straight right hey now

sosa now grips them

i think you and i we can work this thing out do business a long time together
just remember its the only thing i ever tell you dont fuck me tony dont ever try to fuck me
their eyes locked together
in all its caribbean splendor with the long curving beach and rich white buildings bathed in a lovely violet light
music theme continuing over
l in long shot we see an agitated lopez entering his dealership with his bodyguard
against a background of used american cars without great distinction he ad libs his way through some customers and salesmen shaking hands and acting like everybodys favorite uncle
till we see him approach tony who is waiting for him with manny outside his office
he jerks his head
the office is highly decorated with plagues momentos cuban patriot flags and lots of photographs centering on jfk and rfk shaking the hand of lopez who now stares incredulously at

tow just outside the door tony glances at mannys question mark expression
with steel fuck him
tony impeccable in cardin whites and manny also slicked up are shown by an elegant secretary into a plush office
behind the desk sits the heavy lidded cigarette eyed lawyer george sheffield smoking yet another cigarette his voice a hoarse gravelled croak the eyes with their deadxnan stare always pausing
before they speak
he doesnt get up from his desk
his hair is flaming red
we saw him before at the mutiny club

sheffield shifts his eyes briefly back to tony who plops himself in a chair

he sticks out his hand
manny slaps an envelope in it
tony begins counting out the cash right on the tabletop
u tony waits in his red jaguar in the driveway of the building
lopez and his bodyguard exit the building
a limousine pulls up
the threesome get in the limo and drive away
tony gets out of the car crosses to the entrance
tony waits outside the door pushes the buzzer again
elvira opens it a look of utter surprise on her face
she s in jeans barefoot and casual
elvira looks at him still astonished and waiting for an explanation
there is none

she tries to slam the door in his face but he blocks it and bulls in
i got something important to tell ya

she heads for the pool nonplussed
tony closes the door xi eases slowly across the room towards her awkwardly trying to make conversation

the place is raging tonight as tony and manny arrive in tuxedos making their way through the crowd greeting the many people who know them now
we might note tony has refined the art of walking and no longer bulls deonle out of his path he angles th

burgundy suit there is snuggling up to gina on the dance floor
tony is getting pissed he looks around for manny then spots
elvira walking into the club followed by lopez and ernie the bodyguard
lopez is delayed at the door by his buddy the owner and elvira drifts in
his attention diverted from gina tony goes towards her
she sees him coming glances in franks direction
tony comes right up to her
lopez in conversation with the owner glances over sees tony with elvira his expression narrows

he stops his eyes darting to pick out gina laughing as she follows burgundy suit out of the main room and down the stairs to the toilets
without hesitation his irritation peaking now tony darts after her
where you going
hey he doesnt answer
tony comes down the plush velvet stairs flings himself into the ladies room
the ladies surprised look back at him
he moves over to the mens room throws the door open
there are four legs visible in one of the stalls
tony moves past two men washing up and hurls himself against the door
it crashes open on gina in the act of snorting coke with burgundy suit running his ha s along her ass
what are you doing
what are you doing
he grabs burgundy suit by the collar and whips him several times into the wall
trying to him restrain tony

he rips the coke out of her hands and scatters it across the tiles

several more people are watching

tow raging smacks her the face
she reels back across into the toilet
tony stands there abated
the crowd is silent
manny moves across the floor and kneels down consoles gina who is sobbing
tender come on baby its okay

strokes her face disturbed to manny get her home get her outta here
he turns and bulldozes his way through the growing crowd no regrets but disturbed
manny helps gina to her feet

tony isolated and edgy reenters the main room circling the edges of the crowd up to the bar
to the bartenderess pointing gimme a double of that
he turns catches a last glimpse of gina leaving with manny
manny drives gina home in his two seater mercedes sports coupe
shes still angry
hes got a nerve the way he acts
she says he hurts every thing he touches

cause you dont know what youre missing
she leans across the front seat and lightly lays a challenging kiss on his cheek
the ladykiller is rigid in his terror
she gets out of the car crosses in front of his headlights towards the house looking at him
the owner appears at the mike the music drifting to sinatras strangers in the night
all right you coneheads another exciting evening at the babylon hunh
x now i want you to check out this next hombre
i found him stoned in the jungle and theres nothing youll ever see like him
i present with great pride from caracas venezuela octavia
lights dimming to the bluesy rhythm of the sinatra song as sad eyed octavia suddenly appears in the shifting spot light drawing immediate laughter
he is dressed as an enormously fat old man with a quasimodo mask covering both the front and back of his head and neck
with a red bulb for a nose he gyrates grotesquely to the sleek song once the mood of laughter has been established the music suddenly shifts upbeat to saturday night
fever and the clown like a butterfly from a worm starts shedding the stuffing from his clothes his big eyes staring out at us in theatrical melancholy
tony watches sitting alone distracted by the clown
more laughter more clothes coming off building a tempo
pj en the head mask comes off we see the gaunt handsome face of a young clown in white paint with the large blackened eyes staring without expression at the
tony is hooked by the image looks on
the clown is down to his leotards thin as a stick and pulling the girls out onto the floor to dance with him bouncing around like yo yos
everybody is laughing everybody is merry
except tony and the clown weaving in and out of the sharpening spotlight in his white face as the act comes to its close a haunting figure of mockery
tony absorbed by his thoughts is lucky this time
his antennae warn him
out of the side of his eye he sees
the two hitters moving on him
machine gun fire rips through the upholstery smashing the mirrors
screams crowd diving for cover
tony hit in the shoulder rolls gets his baretta out of his ankle firing
hits one of the gunmen in the chest the man staggers across the disco floor firing volleys into the mirrors and ceilings
tony moving under the tables towards the door firing
the second hitter is pinned firing back breaking more mirrors and more screaming
tony lets the gunman have another burst then runs out the door his clothes ripped with blood andglass
the clown octavia lies dead on the silent dance floor
tony runs out crouched to his red jaguar
exchanging shots with a third hitter across the parking lot he runs out of ammunition
he jumps into the jaguar his windows being blown out
the second hitter wounded running out of the club towards him
the third hitter advancing carhops scattering
tony reaching under his seat gets a hold of his own ingram machine pistol cocks it and lays down a field of fire
carhops scattering the hitters seeking cover
hitter two already wounded is hit again his head exploding like squashed watermelon
tony now pops a button
bulletproof blackout shutters whap across the shattered windows
he guns the jaguar out into the lot bullets careening off the armor plating whining against the shutters
tony suddenly brakes the car and reaches down and slams the gear shift into reverse
in an instant his warmobile in reverse accelerates climbing to top speed
as hitter three realizes its too late tries to get out of there but is overtaken and crushed by the car
tow aching from his wound is attended by a doctor who reveals to us an ugly wound on his rib cage
tony looks at it doesnt express a reaction
its going to be sore for a few months
somebody else gonna be a lot sorer
to chi chi find out where lopez is

lopezs bodyguard ernie gets the message from chi chi sliding along the wall next to him manny covering the other side of the room

hundred and fifty pounds bulging with irritated surprise

tony steps aside
manny shoots him with the silencer
lopez crashes backwards draped over his desk like marat in his bathtub amid his patriot flag and his kennedy photographs
every dog has his day

tony turns towards the door

tony walks out alone into the darkened showroom past the hulks of the used cadillacs as we see the shadows of manny and chi chi moving in a stream of
okay elvira lies in her silk sheets
the doorbell rings
she gets up
in a nightgown she opens the front door
tow still in his ruined suit with the arm in a sling moves past her into the apartment
tony just stands there

she understands moves quietly past himtowards the bedroom
tony ambles over to the windows and steps out on the terrace breathing in the air
the lights of miami wink at his feet
the camera moving to one sign down there that says it all flashing its big neon bracelet tony drinks it in
montage passing time to lively marching music
spin counting money
sealing cocaine bags
sosa villa day t sosa on the phone in bolivia

the other guy luis a dark cuban is long lean and smooth with aquiline nose and dancing eyes
he drinks coffee smiles a lot and bullshits two sordid guys who look the part
its a tedious process counting a million five in twenties it takes four five hours and throughout the desultory dialogue tony absorbed by the money and nick never stop the
monotonous work of counting and stacking and noting the at all times all four men thoroughly aware of amounts
the large stacks on the table move and talk gingerly although they appear casual and bored

ernie and chi chi hang around the edges

then shes gone
sosa pulls up a chair right opposite tony almost touching knees
tony i want to discuss something that concerns all of us here

xl gutierrez is a young charismatic man very well dressed and polished in a south american manner who exudes a sense of enormous passion
than oooof our people are more being tortured and held without trial
in the past two years another have simply disappeared
and your government what does it do
it sells my government tanks planes guns but not a word not a whisper about human rights
l xl continued l ive heard whispers doctor gutierrez about the financial support your govern ment receives from the drug industry in bolivia
the irony of course is that this money which is in the billions j i m is coming from your country
you are the major purchaser of our national product which of course is cocaine
so what youre saying doctor gutierrez is the united states government is spending millions of dollars to eliminate the flow of drugs into our streets and at the same time
is doing business with the very same government that floods those streets with cocaine
thats a bit like robbing peter to pay paul isnt it
laughs let me show you some of the other characters in the comedy jim
my organization just recently traced a purchase by this man gutierrez holds up a photograph insert the face on the tv screen dour ruthless
here he is the charming face belongs to general cucombre the defense minister of my country

not your ordinary drug dealer
what are you suggesting we do about this doctor
gutierrez xl passionate the united states government has
to stop supporting these facist gang sters that are running my country that is what your country has to do
you have to set a strong example by calling for the observation of fundamental human rights
staring intently at him reluctantly impressed
gutierrez xl you americans have no idea how important your country is as a symbol and a bastion of those rights
you have no
sosa flips off the television
the lights come on
hes alone with tony
hes scheduled next for minutes

sosa looks up

remains seated sure
how could i forget
alberto you know tony montana my partner from florida

sits with manny and elvira who is dipping into a vial of coke in the purse in her lap
another huge meal is being consumed the best roast beef bottles of red and white wine cigars
so whats the big mystery what

tony looking at her
he passes a silent burp
trying to shift the mood so what about the trial

ignoring the question is this it

elvira reacts wanting to kill
she gets up and dumps her plate filled with food on him
slop drips all over him

the waiter tipping around to clean up the mess
tony slowly wiping the food off himself
how dare you talk to me like that

you really think youre still going to be alive by the time he goes to school tony
youre dreaming tony youre dreaming
the audience is hushed involved the camera moving over the faces of vie and his rich friends
tony acidly quiet looks around at the people back to her

elvira contd in a softer tone oh tony dont you see

past the silent spectators their eyes moving between her and tony
manny rises to follow

tonys stumbling once elvira disappears out the door
eyes follow her
l xl the whole room is watching him sitting there covered with food the silence cathedral
he stands wiping at the food and throwing several hundred dollar bills on the table then looks up angrily at the staring millionaires
youre all assholes

cause none of you got the guts to be what you want to be
he wobbles against the table
manny tries to help
tony shakes him loose

the room is empty for a beat an extended beat the stage without its star and then the audience begins to buzz with horror and delight

l d waits in tonys sedan double parked down the block
tony feeling everythings okay does
a nervous quick snort paces next to the vehicle the shadow disappeared under
ground level the shadow using a pen flashlight removes the bomb from the bag
with subtly inexorable music the camera frames and moves on the bomb wired soldered taped a malignant centipede in the long agile fingers of the shadow who delicately presses a
a glass button on the bomb now flashes red at soothing intervals as the shadow winds a roll of black tape from the bomb to an axle of the car
a cop car comes cruising off the avenue up the street towards us ground level the shadow continues to wind his black tape trying to secure the bomb as tight
tony hurries to the car bends down
the shadow douses it and freezes in position
tony looks up just as the cop car pulls alongside the passenger cop a female noticing him saying something to her partner who eases the car to a halt
tony hurries out into the street taking the initiative
hey officer uh you havent seen a little dog have you a little white poodle its around here somewhere

tony xl seemingly unaffected by the weather reaches for an open pint of ice cream starts eating it with a plastic spoon
he alternates ice cream with coke through the scene the dashboard of the car cluttered with cartons of half eaten chinese food
the shadow disgusted with all this mess restrains himself staring out at the street with a hate filled expression saying nothing
concerned everything okay tony

x through manahattan towards the un
the shadow making the final adjustments on his decoder

a red light pulses at intervals
tony driving glances the tension building in him he does another giant snort
matos sedan swerving out into traffic to pass a car has a near collision with an insane bus driver and has to brake suddenly angling into a deep pothole shaking
the car and honking angrily after the bus
the shadow goes nuts peering over the dashboard to see if the bomb came loose
to himself spanish madre de dios my bomb

perspiration starting to break out on his forehead
tony also feels the sweat coming on
muttering this is fuckin crazy man this is sloppy doing it this way you dont do it like this

the shadow glances over at tony astonished
tony pumps two shots point blank into him blowing his face off and smashing him against the door of the moving sedan blood and brains splattering the windows and the
oh jesus christ
tony swerving the sedan back across the avenue the traffic around them honking and moving along at its normal pace as the shadows body slumps down out of sight another
monday morning traffic accident with blood and brains splattered up against a passenger window and nobody really sees

god help me what have i done to you

how dies santo did you become such xl a monster such an ugly little monster
tony slams the door we hold a beat on her face as as she had finally answered her own questions
if tony stomps into his white corniche ernie discreetly closing the door and getting in with chi chi as mama rips open her door in b
and stands there staring from the doorway weeping and staring across the dark
tony takes a strong hit of coke
the car whistles off
tony in the backseat of the corniche with chi chi studies the house from across the curb
its quiet rich suburban not calling attention to itself
tony seething snorts another line of coke laid out on the crystal bar dividing the backseat and rewed goes
to chi chi wait here
he approaches the front door listening the hand sliding into his pocket
inside a wistful billy joel song plays over the stereo
he rings a buzzer waits
the door opens casually
standing there hold is manny with a towel around his waist
tony stares stunned
gina now comes into view behind manny in a bathrobe a big smile of welcome for her brother
eyes suddenly moving downward in alarm tony with his baretta pointed at max my his expression filled with loathing
manny smiles easily and shrugs the gesture drawing tony over the edge
hey tony cmon we was
the gun fires
tony fires a second time
manny slowly slumps downward against the doorjamb eyes on tow terribly surprised
tony holds the gun staring down separated from himself
manny lies at his feet dead
she goes down to her knees stunned out of her mind shakes him
she looks up insanely at tony her eyes huge with disbelief
you killed him
shaking her head at him incredulously
we got married just yesterday
we were gonna surprise you
tony stands there doubly stunned by the news
manolo oh manolo whatd he do
whatd he do
she hugs his corpse tightly to her breast and makes horrible strangled sounds with her throat
somebodys seen the chi chi hurrying up to tony worried shooting
we gotta get out of tony here
to gina come on baby
suddenly she goes berserk
and shoving chi chi aside launches herself on tony screaming incoherently like a madwoman trying to kill him
she beats him around the head the chest scratches furrows of flesh from his face
he stands there oblivious numbed
chi chi and ernie have a demon on their hands
they manage at last to yank her off tony kicking and continuing to scream
lights coming on in the houses around the neighborhood
chi chi and ernie desperate now drag her forcefully along the pavement into the corniche
she continues to scream
to chi chi get the body
tony back at the door looks down again
the eyes of manolo staring sightlessly
chi chi runs back grabs tony
tony snaps out of it
chi chi lifting nannys body hauling it
tony getting into the corniche ernie pinning gina against the front seat
chi chi propping mamy into the drivers seat with him
the car roars away
the camera closing on gina as she looks through the glass partition of the corniche
at the slumped head of mamy in f
i the music surging unexorably
the white corniche whistles by like a hearse heading for hell
it goes roaring by the front gate and up the driveway gravel flying
the camera curving to reveal two sedans inching up the shadowed street towards us their lights out
t h e cars eight men emerge silently blending into the shadows
of the trees
r e v
l tony scratchesacross his face strides through the front door into the marble foyer
another marielito is waiting x for them at the door
ernie and chi chi are almost carrying gina who is numb with shock
chi what do we do with her tony
put her upstairs
put her in my bedroom
to gina itll be all right pussycat youll see everything be okay ill take care of you
she looks up at him through her stupor and spits in his face
chi chi and ernie pull her away as tony stares xl they trundle her up the stairs
tony upset but passive
turns and walks away
a haze of coke rises off the tony slumps on his couch
velvet like a snow scene painting on a christmas card
oblivious to the dust he cuts open a fresh plastic kilo bag of coke and spreads the entire pound out across the black marble coffee table
ernie and chi chi come in
x chi chi xl we got some pills into her shes cooling down
tony pays no attention ernie and chi chi noticing the pile xl of coke
flashing his silver tooter tony snorts a truly giant amount in a large pendular swing of his elbow across the length of coffee table
pause as he lets it sink in
worried boss what we gonna do now
were gonna war thats what we we go z eat sosa for gonna do
were gonna close that fucker down
ernie and chi chi sharing a look
xl chi chi xl eyeing the coke hey tony why dont you go easy on that stuff hunh
tony looks up at him focuses
the eyes are uncompromising
ernie a little scared of him now turns away
chi chi x follows
tony starts on another trek along the coffee table
the bengal tiger paces his spot restless
a monsoon like wind blows through the trees on the estate
the monkeys listen quietly
the f lamingoes flutter
then theres a burst of loud music from the stereo speakers on the balcony a billy joel song something smooth and easy about the high times and how fast they
see tony in long shot throw open the terrace and we doors and stagger out onto the balcony overlooking his estate
on a closer angle we track him to the edge of the balustrade
hes done so much coke now hes practically catatonic staggering and muttering to himself
insensate jesus fuckin christ whatsa matter with me get a hold of yself now these cocksuckers gonna run over you let em try i bury the cocksuckers
his point of view panning his estate
the dark emptiness the wind rustling the treetops
tony echoes back at him
shaking his head at himself he starts to cry
l ooooh fuck manny how the fuck did i do that
how the fuck
oh manny manny
you were there for me you were the one manny you understood always understood
well what the hell happened hunh
what the hell happened to us
in far b g
now behind tony on the video monitors in his office we see the main gate and guard shack a marielito crosses into x view checks the gate turns
suddenly two figures spring out at him
one of them garrotting the marielito
another monitor now reveals two more figures moving into the interior of the guard shack
they knife the other marielito a third monitor
carries another image of shadows moving through the trees on the estate
on the balcony tony is oblivious to it all spent almost incoherent
i said to you manny i said i never go crazy and you said i would you sonofabitch and you was right
those were the good days hunh we was crazy back in those days wed do anything you and me we was on the way up nobody nothing coulda stopped us
cause we were the best hunh the fucking best
as tony turns and starts back through the terrace doors into his study the camera glides around to a view of a hook flying up and catching the balustrade
a shadow starts climbing up as we still are manny we still are see im gonna wipe out all them fuckers out there im gonna run the market im gonna
be king cocaine you hear me you buy you buy from me tony montana
covers of all the magazines
television stars movie stars shooting stars hes a star
x xl as he crosses into his office the camera moves to reveal gina standing there half dressed in the doorway her eyes blazing with hatred
tony sees her
she steps forward offering her body almost naked to her brother
is this what you want tony
you cant stand another man touching me
so you want me tony is that it
well here i am t she fires the baretta we now see in her hand
the bullet grazes tony in the leg snapping him from his catatonia as he goes reeling across the floor behind his desk
she fires again
im all yours tony im all yours now
bullets ripping into the desk
she advances offering her sex methodically shooting out the clip at rhythmic intervals
come and get me tony
before its too late
he spins across the run away from the desk trying to put distance between them
she sees him scurrying
turns an expression like a demented angel
come on tony fuck me
advancing on him firing
the furniture tearing up the chair spilling television sets and computer toys shattering tony squirming away hit again in the thigh shocked scrambling over to the terrace windows
her next shot shatters the window and as tony ducks again to the side we see outside onto the terrace behind him r e v
l a young columbian punk no more than twenty one of the hitters is crouched there reacting to the broken window
he doesnt hesitate turning his machine gun on gina
gina is torn to pieces by the firepower blown across the room spine severed and dead before she hits the floor
tony sees it yells something in the same instant swivels to knock the barrel of the machine gun aside
the punk is taken by surprise not having seen tony and tony now runs him backwards across the balcony and hurls him over the balustrade
the punk lands in one of the shallow pools on the grounds at the base of the balcony
tony from above grabs up the punks machine gun and empties the whole clip into the figure thrashing in the pool below
ernie runs into view on the far side of the pool spots x yells up tony get outta tony theyre everywhere
ernie suddenly wheels hit in the face by a burst of x silencer bullets
we catch a brief glimpse of sosas black aide the skull moving quickly along the wall of the house directly underneath the balcony on which tony stands
tony tossing the empty machine gun aside wildly runs back into his office to get more guns crosses to gina corpse
it takes him by surprise
he comes to a dead stop kneels looking questioningly in her face
gently hey gina come on you still angry at me
i didnt mean to kill manny i was
running his hands along her face trying to rouse her gently lifting her eyelids
bloods running out of her mouth in rivers
c nt nmd f tony tx come on gina get off the floor
youre all dirty now you need a bath
mamis gonna be angry baby ooh is she gonna be mad at me
come on open your eyes my baby open your eyes
give me a smile
theres been a steady pounding and calling now on the door x of the office
tony finally hears it looks up then over at the monitors
one of them reveals chi chi standing there outside the door pounding it
on the monitor we see chi chi suddenly spin and open fire down into the foyer
return fire decimates him
a grenade goes off blows him up against the door
he now seems to come out of his catatonia runs to his sideboard hauls out a rocket shoulder fired rocket launcher and straps an uzi across his shoulder
he looks up at the monitor
on the monitors the hitters are now darting across the foyer and coming up the left and right hand stairs
three of them are already huddled outside the door around the corpse of chi chi motioning to each other laying a grenade at the base of the door to blow
tony loading his rocket ihtends to beat them to the punch talking to himself
so you wanna play hunh say hello xi to my little friend here
the rocket tears down the door and blows the columbian it sounds like punks off the landing into the foyer
armageddon one of the hitters screaming smoke billowing wildly
tony at the height of his mad glory steps out at the apex of the stairs firing his machine gun and yelling
c nt nued whores
you think you x can kill me with lousy bullets hunh
he rev f another hitter tumbles down the right hand stair
who you think i am
i kill all you fuckin assholes
i take you all to fuckin hell
right another hitter drops screaming off the stairs into the pool below
a grenade goes off
tony is hit again but keeps on firing away
laughing like a madman
you need an army you hear
an army to kill me
behind him we see the remainder of the pound of cocaine go up in a burst of wind whipping around the office in auras of white
it is a ghostly effect out of which now appears the face of the skull moving from the terrace towards tonys back with a sawed off shotgun
ha ha ha ha ha
you whores you scum i piss in your faces
ha ha ha ha ha
skull now inches from tonys back pulls the trigger the and blows tonys spine out his belly
tony crashes forward over the bannister into the interior swimming pool below
he floats quietly face down in the lit blue waters
as the titles begin their crawl up the music theme is expressive salsa with a dash of gaiety
the camera moving off tony to catch the reflection of the lit sculpture on the surface of the still waters
it says and so for the brief moment it was
