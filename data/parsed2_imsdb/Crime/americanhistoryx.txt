screenplay by david mckenna february a young mans blue eyes slowly open
a girl moans from the next room
turns the corner and splashes through a puddle from an earlier rain
tupac shakur blares from inside
they snap wide as the young woman in the next room moans even louder
a slight buzz emanates from the power lines and street lights above the humble vinyard household
a black ford bronco rests in the driveway
tupacs rapping builds
the window tinted drive by slowly heads down the residential street cruises past the bronco in the driveway and slows to a stop
the music stops and two black men spring from the car
they move with purpose
the larger figure crowbar in hand moves to the truck
the gun wielding passenger hurries to the front door and stands guard
inside the car another man methodically waits
the sex happening in the next room makes it difficult for danny to sleep
next to a digital clock that reads am the clean cut year old flips to his side
a poster of lee ving of fear onstage taped to the wall
pre calculus and biology books on the floor
cassettes scattered on his tiny desk
a stereo in the corner
the off screen sound of breaking glass grabs dannys attention
he sits up and looks through the blinds
danny sees a man reach through the broken window and unlock the door
pans to the idling trans am
his fearful expression says it all
danny quickly bolts out of his room and into the adjacent bedroom down the hall
he barges through the door
it hangs above a serious computer and next to a giant tome filled bookshelf
the moans meanwhile approach orgasm
tight on derek vinyard
the young man has a shaved head a thick goatee and a well crafted swastika on his left tit
on top of derek in the bed is his barely of age girlfriend stacey
the covers are completely off and a black rose is tattooed across her right shoulder blade
danny watches her fuck only for a second
danny walks over and shakes him
startled derek forcefully grabs his little brothers arm
stacey stops and looks over
frustated she rolls off derek and onto her side
fucking pervert dan
theres a black guy outside der
breaking into your car
derek muscled and tattooed jumps out of the bed and quickly puts on his skivvies
he reaches under his mattress pulls out a sig
semi automatic pistol and shoves in a clip
how long has he been out there
stacey sits up quickly from the bed as derek pulls on his black combat boots
whos out there derek
not right now honey
to danny how many
is he strapped
does he have a fucking gun dan
im not sure
is there a driver
danny nods his head yes
stay the luck here
he looks at his girlfriend and walks off
tight on derek
he walks down the hall
the intensity on his face is alarming
he stops at the front door and grabs the doorknob
before he turns the knob he peeks through the eye hole on the door
the black guard carelessly turns toward the driveway to see whats taking his partner so long with the wires
the guard has his back to him
derek throws open the door and the black man standing guard wheels and fires a shot into the front door
derek buries two bullets in his chest
the force propels the man six feet backwards
stunned by the gunfire he charges back to the getaway tranny
derek buries a bullet into his shoulder
the car splits and derek fires a shot through the side window
he then walks towards the car and fires shot after shot at it until it disappears
davina and doris vinyard yell in the background like they were in vietnam
they meet in the hallway still not able to place the direction of the gunfire
they stay down on the carpet together
from the rain soaked window he watches derek face his wounded prey crawling on the ground
sirens sound from a distance
get down danny
tight on danny
his gaze is locked on his brother from his bedroom window
derek cocks his piece points it and walks toward the man
tight on dereks face
a black man in a suit and tie robert sweeney goes through the automatic doors and into the station
he approaches a desk sergeant
a daily calendar on her desk reads monday
down that hall
third door on the left
cops and detectives sit attentively and a few sip coffee
the clock on the wall above reads am
middle aged with slicked back hair captain john rasmussen finishes a thought
he spots sweeney as he enters and aimlessly reaches for a file
moving on acknowledging good morning doctor
the group looks over and meets sweeneys hard glare
gentlemen this is dr
hes principal over at venice high and for some time now hes done a load of outreach work with gangs
in and out of the can
sweeney nods as rasmussen cough
he sips water and continues
three years ago a local kid named derek vinyard gets sent up for murdering a couple of crips who were trying to jack his car
bob taught vinyard back in high school and has followed the case closely
he was a skinhead right
derek was more like
he and cameron alexander
rasmussen opens a file in front of him
there rests dereks mug shot
he flips it over and reveals cammerons mug shot
front and side view
cammeron alexander is probably the biggest writer and distributor of white power literature in la county
he promotes white power bands writes reviews columns all at the ripe age of forty
smiling hes forty
pretty clean record
runs everything out of his house down by the beach
there werent any organized white gangs around venice before those two hooked up
very few if any
it was mostly just black and mexican
but it was tiny
they hit it off though
and alexander hit the jackpot with derek
rasmussen reaches over and pushes play on a vcr
we got some uncut footage here
courtesy of nbc
earlier this evening
la county firefighter dennis vinyard was shot and killed while putting out a fire in a suspected compton drug den
to the group this being february of
a younger derek short haired with no tattoos stands next to the reporter
derek wears a venice high basketball jersey drenched in sweat
towel around neck he thinks to himself as the man speaks into the camera
to my right i have lieutenant vinyards oldest son derek
to derek how do you feel about all this son
how do i feel
how do you think i feel
typical how derek
look at our country
its a haven for criminals
so youre saying the murder of your father is race related
every problem in this country is race related
every problem not just crime
these problems are rooted in the black community the hispanic community the asian
every non protestant group in our society
then look at the shit
theyre all the problems of the non white
look at the statistics
most of these issues youre referring to though son are related to interrupting no no no
dont say poverty right now cause thats not it
theyre not a product of our fucking environment either
minorities dont give two shits about this country
theyre here to exploit
over reporters question when alexander got his hands on this segment
he copied it sent it out and it became the gettysberg address for hate groups across the country
millions of white europeans came to this country and flourished within a generation
so what the fuck is wrong with these people
what does any of this have to do with your father
because my father was doing his fucking job
saving a nigger neighborhood he didnt give two shits about
and he got killed by some drug dealer who still collects a fucking welfare check
derek looks at the man and walks over to his mother doris who smokes a cigarette
the camera follows him as he puts his arm around her and escorts her back inside their venice beach residence
the camera pans back to the reporter who just stands there speechless
rasmussen ejects the tape the screen turns to fuzz and he turns it off
vinyard was quietly released from chino on saturday after three and some odd years
and i think its something we might want to keep an eye on for a few days
i dont wanna be an alarmist
but payback is out there
i know it is
and in this particular case
if vinyard gets popped
more people will get popped
its not exactly lapd policy but i want hour surveillance on vinyard for a few days
smiling in disbelief twenty four hour surveillance sir
just for a few days
he doesnt sound like mr
lovely here captain
you want us to bust him or protect him
rasmussen offers sweeney a look that its his question
i dont think vinyards gonna be the one to start anything
its his following
lets keep it low
peaceful day by pennywise blasts from dannys walkman headphones
the day is cloudy and overcast but that doesnt bother the local surfers
a twosome paddles north to get a better break on the next set
danny watches as he skateboards down the strand
his appearance is changed now resembling a younger softer derek
head shaved to a quarter of an inch he wears a plain white backpack with punk white power bands scribbled all over it
your standard sex pistols dk germs g
and adolescents in black
cro magnons and skrewdriver off to the left
in red is the largest name dick nixon
kids from all walks of life park their cars lock their bikes and head off to class
danny throws his skateboard in slams the door and turns to face lizzy a pretty redheaded freshman
the two smile at one another as the first bell rings
danny takes a piss
outside a voice pleads it wasnt me
daryl dawson pale and thin is shoved into the bathroom and he trips into the sink
little henry a young black kid enters with two of his buddies
danny zips up and faces them
to a terrified daryl tellin baker im fuckin cheatin
ive never cheated in my life
beat his ass henry
why you trippin on me
i didnt say anything henry
hes lying man
i was right there
little henry cracks daryl in the face and practically knocks him down with one shot
a bleeding daryl struggles to his hands and knees behind danny
next time man
danny stares into henrys eyes and the trio exits
dannv helps daryl back up to the sink
the second bell rings
kids have just settled into their seats
danny walks in and tries to be discrete
an older teacher writes an algebra problem on the board for the students to solve
the man grabs a pink slip off his desk and hands it to danny
but it looks like you got bigger problems
reading the slip oh man
get a job
the teacher stares at him
he sits in a chair next to an office door marked dr
robert sweeney principal
danny glances at the secretary as she types and talks on the phone
tight on danny
he listens to the conversation through the the crack in the door as his eyes swell
i do not have a problem with him as an individual alright
oh shit murray sure you do
you hate this kid
the bespectacled short haired murray rosenberg looks over and spots danny listening outside
murray walks over and shuts the door
he looks at dr
sweeney who now has his jacket off
he points to a typewritten report on the desk and smiles in horror
it is titled book report mein kampf
daniel vinvard american history is in the upper left hand corner
this paper is a travesty bob
arguing for hitler as a civil rights hero
youve gotta draw a line
it says in your syllabus that they could do their report on any book related to the struggle for civil rights
oh come on bob
let me finish
he needs help
im not disputing that
but i read it and im not going to throw him out
his brother probably put him up to it
i can guarantee you his brother didnt have anything to do with it murray
murray sighs and takes off his glasses
dont let him walk scot free here
for his sake
you might be all he has left
sweeney stares at the younger teacher and nods
murray walks out and turns back to sweeney
get in here dan
danny and murray make hostile eye contact
i knew it was you
shut up and get your ass in here
before he even gets through the door hes chastised
whats it gonna be dan
whats what going to be
this petty shit youre pullin
i dont know
you said it all right
danny does what hes told
sweeney stares at the teenager and leans back in his chair
are you okay
any time you wanna talk dan okay
he was a student of mine
he was a great student
but he hung out with scumbags
also like you
thats why he ended up in the pen hunh
sweeney holds up dannys paper
i cant correct it though
it wreaks too much of shit

i followed directions and wrote an a paper
its got nothing to do with derek
everything you do now has something to do with derek
who told you to do this

the power forward dribbles beautifully up the court his teammates clearing out the key
defensively derek is solid

derek looks at jerome and lawrence from afar
danny notices the two men stare at his brother ready to kill
derek meets their gaze
danny awakens from his daydream
the black players now stare at him
danny puts his board down and skates down the boardwalk
it was only the beginning
then derek once told me that minorities would take america over one day
that white people are too afraid
maybe he was right
danny skates up to the gate and kicks his board up to his hand
he passes two surfboards on his way towards the back
lizzy the redhaired beauty from earlier and her blond friend kammi sturable out and laugh

they all laugh and danny breaks off and heads east on rose
davina vinyard in a ucla t shirt and panties cries on the couch as she hugs a long haired derek
doris sobs as she lays under a pink blanket burdened by the flu
shirtless derek grabs doris hand and leans over to kiss her

danny skates up to his residence and looks at a car across the street
two plainclothes cops from the earlier meeting sit in their car and stare from afar

the phone rings and derek rushes down the hall to get it

danny looks to his mother

danny wipes away her tears kisses her and moves away quickly so he wont get sick
he listens to the man on the other line

she opens the door and tries to shut it immediately
skinhead fat seth from the game earlier wears a good guys stereo uniform

he laughs to himself and exits
he bangs on dereks door once more pissed that derek didnt open it earlier
he heads for the living room
danny davina and doris are glued to the news story on the same station
doris once beautiful is now aged and graying
nyquil pepto bismol two prescription containers and a spoon rest on the coffee table
speaks angrily to the reporter covering the story
random black protestors nod and comment in the background
maybe now whites will understand the motives behind people like malcolm x and the black panthers
just put the shoe on the other foot
danny walks towards derek and they smile and hug
davina and doris soon join in
davina derek vinyard deserved the death penalty for what he did to that young man

derek sits down beside her hands her the water and caresses her head
the others stare at her in the background

derek follows seth out the side window and goes down the alley
she thinks to herself and closes her eyes
derek looks at the oblivious cops and drops into the passengers seat
seth starts the engine and drives away
as the truck disappears we pick up on a white souped up jeep cherokee turning the corner
tinted windows it cruises past the apartment complex
dannys attention is everywhere except on his homework
he walks back out of his bedroom
he watches davina complete her homework on the couch
doris on the sofa opposite tries to sleep
come here for a second
the scholar sets her homework aside and impatiently follows him down the hall
she sits on the edge of dannys bed
danny hands her his assignment instructions
i got shit to do dan
just read it
she sighs and begins to read it out loud
american history x
take home paper as assigned by principal robert sweeney
to danny why is he giving you homework
what happened to murray
asshole turned me in
describe in detail your opinion of the historical event that took place in the early morning of october th
the night derek wasted those guys
davina takes a moment
sweeney gave you this
continuing her reading before and after
how has this event helped or hurt your present perspective concerning life in contemporary america
use the standard five paragraph format blab blab blah thisll be good for you
itll be good for you
she stares at him for a good three seconds
eat me dan
dick nixons playin at cammerons tonight
you owe me
im not doing your homework for you
i gotta spreadsheet due
davina walks to the door and looks back to her brother
whats the matter with you
you wanna be a fuckin loser your whole life
not receiving a response she walks out the door
he slowly begins to strike the computer keys
the screen reads people look at me and they see my brother
thats the way things have gone since the murder of our father tight on danny
the frustated kid sits and thinks to himself
the broad expanse of an empty dimly lit parking lot
in the distant corner we see a few parked cars and a group of skins gathering
it was lunacy after he left us
all the time
derek believed in cammeron
he was angry
that combination gave them bodies
sick of gettin their asses kicked by black and mexican gangs at school
seven skins including seth and curtis smoke and wait
danny looks to his left and sees derek with cammeron who sits in the drivers seat of the bronco
stacey leans in from the backseat
i hope you kill that fucker
derek looks back at her and straight to cameron
he might have a gun
are you going in or not
you know i got the cops on me
if i come up on one of those cameras im a dead man
derek stares at the older man who appears nervous
somebody needs to drive derek
referring to his mouth all right
you can turn it off now
back to stacey youre right on his tail right
nodding i hate that fucking korean
i hope you smash his face in
just be ready okay
she nods and derek gets out
the group is silent
lets pull it together
were not playing fuckin games here
the group snaps to attention behind him as seth toys with the camera
curtis from earlier takes a hit off a joint and makes derek wait for him
derek walks over to the crazy man takes the joint and throws it onto the ground
what the fuck curtis
you a fuckin nigger now
want some crack
grabbing his neck pull your fucking stupid head out of your ass then
to the group were here tonight cause we got immigration problems spiralling out of control
we got asians up the ass
taking over our land with their fucking yen
flocking into this place like some giant fucking pinata was shattered
the group busts up
cammeron watches derek and smiles
on the statue of liberty it says give me your tired your hungry your poor your huddled masses
yearning to be free
it does not say give me your shiftless your greedy your indolent your criminals looking for a free ticket
the group agrees
were here tonight to show the government how we feel about minorities taking over our country
the treat us like criminals while they reward them with jobs and fucking welfare checks
and its only getting worse
nodding fuck yeah it is
are you ready to do something about it
and theyre moving
directly at us
as the camera swings into line tracking with them derek reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a stocking mask
he pulls it down over his face
the foot soldiers follow him in unison
back to his troops remember
stay right on my fucking ass man
and now theyre getting ahead of us
as the camera swings behind them we see their destination
they storm the front entrance
the few people who are in there scream and scramble for cover
derek grabs a mexican boxboy and throws him to the ground
seth catches up to another and gets him on the ground
whetos your fucking green card asshole
seth kicks the young man in the face with a blatant shot and continues
derek leaves a terrified white woman alone like shes not even there and pushes over an adjacent shelf knocking over another worker with cans of referring to the border cant
hide from me motherfucker
he kicks the man and looks around the market for more
danny watches in awe
curtis breaks a giant jelly jar over a head
another skin throws a black checker into a shelf of potato chips
he looks up at one of the aisle mirrors
he rushes out with a pistol
he takes aim on curtis and head and proceeds to kick him
danny looks at derek like hes superman
derek looks to his watch and straightens up
were outta here
from just inside the door we see skins get in their last blows and pour out the aisles and pass us through the doors
the camera holds on the wreckage he takes off his stocking mask and stares at his stone faced brother
and before derek could even blink
he had a crazed army behind him
danny sparks up a cigarette and types on the screen
willing to follow his word like it was the word of god
as the rain falls we see the vinyards sitting at the table
stacey and murray rosenberg doris then boyfriend who we met earlier round out the clan
stacey sits close to derek
and then came october th
doris looks wonderful while murray mustache and beard shakes his head at derek as he chatters away
things were fine on the homefront
my mom had a good job but a below average boyfriend
we had a four bedroom house that dad left us with
everyone was happy
tight on derek
shaved head rolled up sleeves tattoos loosened tie la copy center name tag from earlier
his charisma draws their attention as he rambles over the crackling rainfall
everyone but derek
fuck you murray
white men dont cruise the streets of la killing each other
you guys make bombs
derek stares at the man eyes filled with homicide
youre so fucking lame
a couple of cranks in cabins in montana is not statistically significant
then white americans dont take pcp and drink and drive a hundred and twenty fuckin miles an hour
we pull over and trust the law
youre kidding right
sarcastically dont you know murray
white people never break the law
were perfect little angels
thats not what i said davina
to the group three different times rodney king comes at those officers with the intent to hurt them
to hurt them
but since we see it on some fucking tampered videotape
the bleeding heart media makes you believe that he only comes at them once
all we see is powell koon and wind hittin him and busting up laughing briseno kickin him in the back of the fuckin skull with his boot
still the dumbfucks tryin to get up and kick their asses
thats how stupid that motherfucker is
those cops used textbook solid tactics and if dad were still here hed say the same damn thing
that doesnt make it right
yes it does
yes it does
they are taught to use that stick and they did
cops have been granted a certain amount of authority by society and white people unfortunately are the only ones who acknowledge it
i acknowledge a cops authority
davina starts to laugh
look whos talking about respecting the law
thats two errors in one sentence davina so take a fucking course in semantics
first error i didnt say i respect the law
i said i respect a cops authority
im not a member of the fuckin low rent disorganized redneck ku klux klan
pull your head outta your ass and look at who youre dealing with
dont speak to her that way derek
murray stay out of it
youre not a member of this family and you never will be
what the hell does that have to do with anything
to derek you know
sometimes its hard to believe i gave birth to you
give thanks to the food on the table and then believe it doris
we both put food on this table fella
the point is
if dan was walking across the street that night and rodney king plowed into him can we forget about rodney king for chrissake
fiercely continuing while hopped up on chivas and p
youd consider the force those cops used to be justified
he didnt hit anybody
if he did though
if that shithead killed dan
you would have believed the beating to be justified and so would everybody else
but since he didnt hit anyone
its hands across america for the son of a bitch
derek takes a bite of food
we are still so hung up in this notion that we have an obligation to help the struggling black man and all you contribute to it
lincoln freed the slaves a hundred and thirty years ago
get off your fucking asses
im with you honey
all the way
here we go
nobody likes chief whatever his name is right
so here comes this filthy piece of garbage in his hyundai
he pulls over in front of a perfectly lighted area where a video camera is sitting there
fucking waiting for him man
what happens next
chief gates is dust
its total davina drops her silverware on the plate with a clatter and looks at her mother
everyone stares at davina
to doris may i be excused please
dont interrupt davina
i didnt interrupt shit
the hell you didnt
i was listening to stacey and then i heard you
thats called interrupting
wait til shes finished and you can be excused
who the hell do you think you are
derek jumps up from the table and grabs her by the back of the hair
the table jolts and plates tumble to zhe floor
you dont know when to shut up
what are you trying to prove man
derek turns and laughs at murray
im trying to teach my sister some respect murray
let go of my fucking hair
to murray see
see the way she speaks
tell me youre gonna shut up and ill let go
let go of her hair and sit down
i will when i hear an answer doris
are you going to shut up davina
tight on danny
he gets up quickly and tries to pull derek off
derek turns and cracks danny in the face with a backhand dropping him back into a cabinet
a crystal vase with flowers crashes to the floor just missing dannys head
to danny what are you thinkin
are you okay
danny nods his head as everyone looks at derek
its a real easy question davina
a simple yes or no will suffice
tell me what i want to hear and ill let go
derek takes a piece of roast beef off her plate and shoves it in her mouth
me holds the whole piece inside so she cant spit it out
davina cries as she chokes on the meat
she cant breathe derek
stay back both of you
its her bed shes gotta lie in it
grabbing harder you can cry all you want davina
im not gonna let go until you tell me what i wanna hear
are you going to shut that fat fucking mouth of yours and let my girlfriend tell her opinion
doris grabs him from behind and he aggressively turns on her
derek curls his tongue behind his teeth and raises his arm like hes actually going to smack his mother
she grabs his arm though forcefully
let go of her hair and get out
derek releases his grip on his sister and she spits the roast beef onto the floor
she runs into the back bedroom crying choking and coughing
i hate you you fucking asshole
the door slams shut in the background
doris murray danny and stacey all stare at derek
derek calmly faces his brother
in slo mo time freezes as derek slowly turns his head back to murray
on the track we hear a few keys being typed and then silence
a cigarette sizzles
he takes a long drag off his cigarette and exhales
he slowly runs his hands over his stubbly head marveling at the past
derek smiles at murray in wonder and disbelief
would you care to repeat that murray
im not sure i got all of it
smiling he called you a psycho honey
smiling back was that it
here we go again with this derek
making me out to be the bad guy again
you callin me a liar rosenkike
to stacey hey goddammit
you talk to me with respect or
or what murray
whatre you gonna do
give her fucking detention
both of you get out right now
murray stares at derek with pity
doris becomes emotional
to derek do you think youre the only one whos affected around here
derek focuses on his mother for a moment
a captivated danny watches and waits as derek turns to murray
out of respect for my mother
im gonna let that comment go murray
i wont bash your face in
but let me tell you somethin
man to fuckin mouse here
normally in a situation like this id take my steel tips to your fucking jewish temple
that goes for anyone making comments about me my family stacey whomever
you know and i know that i could crush that puny fuckin skull of yours in a second
so its beyond me why you would say something like that without being able to back it up
whats worse you sack of shit is you calling the woman i love a liar
i never said she was a liar
weasel like that again murray
you fuckin ponytail pussy bagel eating teacher faggot
and ill cut your shylock nose off
make no mistake
murray silently walks out of the house
derek claps and sings the jewish celebration song hava naghila
stacey joins in and the two laugh
doris goes after murray
murray goes to his car and doris follows
danny watches from the door
hes a stupid kid murray
hes not a kid doris
we were kids
we didnt call people kikes
its just gonna take some time with him
what can i do
you dont know your children doris
you have no clue about the world they live in
your son is a terrorist
hes not a terrorist murray
hes a member of the disciples of christ
you remember that grocery store incident
my sister and her two kids got evacuated from her temple in woodland hills
derek would never have anything to do with bombs okay
you dont know him like i do
and i wouldnt want to
murray gets inside and goes down the street
dannys pov he watches doris stand alone her face in her hands crying
behind dan a humiliated davina storms towards derek now wielding a baseball bat
derek hears dan and looks out of the corner of his eye
he spots her at the last moment
take this you fucking dick
derek pops up quickly disarms her and pulls her close
whispering in her ear im sorry davina
let go of me
come on davina
i lost control
i screwed up
derek holds tight until the crying girl settles down
hes gripped as desperately by remorse as he was moments before by rage
he kisses and repeats his apology over and over
finally she succumbs and puts her arms around him
derek looks to danny
hugging davina you guys are my life and id do anything for you
you do know that
wiping her tears i dont believe you anymore
i swear to god i would davina
i believe you der
derek smiles at his little brother lovingly
please forgive me
nodding after a beat that fuckin sucked derek
i know it did
and im sorry
i just really hate that guy
you couldnt tell
a rainsoaked doris walks through the front door
find an apartment because i want you out of here
morn im sorry but that guys i dont wanna hear it anymore
i want you out
he can move in with me
she walks past derek and into the back bedroom
he rises from the computer and peeks out the blinds
the two cops supposedly watching derek are now eating in the car
one of them looks up
danny flips the blinds down
from the other room he hears doris break into another coughing fit
he sits beside her and hands her a glass of water
thank you honey
she coughs recovers and sips
danny walks away
sit with me
ive got this thing to do
you can sit down for two seconds
he looks at her and sits beside her
dont breathe on me
they share a smile
its cold in here no wonder your sick
she stares and smiles at him for a few moments
im not allowed to look at you anymore
he smothers her face with his hand jokingly
laughing daniel patrick
are you ever gonna let that beautiful hair grow back
i bet you will
he smiles and locks eyes with his mother for several moments
he finally rises and walks back to his room
get some sleep
if you need me to proof anything for you i will
ill be all right
wake up early if you get tired
doris watches him disappear down the hall distant thoughts creeping back slowly
he grabs a flannel and throws it on
he sees a cigar box that rests on the right shelf
he grabs it and looks inside
the rolled up la times clipping reads prominent skinhead charged with murder
the accompanying picture of derek is near evil
tight on his eyes
danny stares at the clipping
on the he watches derek fire his gun at the trans am as it blazes down the street
he walks over to the wounded man on the lawn and points his weapon
get on the floor danny
danny looks down at her and hurries out of his room
he hovers over big lawrence
gun pointed steadily he kicks him in the stomach over and over tongue pressed against teeth
hot air flows from dereks breath and into the cold
you fucked with the wrong bull
danny watches his brother from the front porch
let the cops handle it der
the cops will let him walk
derek grabs lawrence and drags him to the curb
ever shoot at firemen you fuck
then open your mouth and put it on the corner of the curb
im gonna teach you a little lesson
get in the fucking house dan
danny doesnt move
come on man
call an ambulance
my dad gave me that truck motherfucker
couldnt leave well enough alone
put your mouth on the corner of the fucking curb
derek cocks his piece and lawrence complies his teeth now scraping concrete
sirens sound from afar
danny walks out into the middle of the street to check it out
the cops are comin der lawrence mumbles something unintelligible from his outstretched mouth
what the fuck did you say
you just threaten me
derek stomps his foot on the back of lawrences head completely tearing his jaw in half on the curbs corner
crying holy fucking shit
what the hell was that for
the two lock eyes
derek does not flinch
helicopter lights shine on the house
cop cars screech to a halt
two cops take cover behind their door draw their guns and shout instructions
derek puts the gun down puts his arms behind his head and drops to his knees
his eyes are remorseless
joseph conrad once wrote that murder is always with us
its almost an institution
that couldnt rang more true than with me
five patrol cars a fire truck two ambulances and a throng of terrified neighbors strangle the front of the house
clothed and handcuffed derek is escorted from the house by two uniformed cops and rasmussen
bobby lawrence died of massive head trauma early that morning
derek marches past the bodies which are being tended to thoroughly
six months after that
derek was convicted and sentenced to seven years for voluntary manslaughter
to be served at the california state penitentiary in chino
rasmussen forces dereks head down and he gets in the car
he stares at his brother and sister as police lights flash on him
then to stacey
finally to a lifeless doris
they lock eyes as the patrol car takes off down the street
prosecutors wanted murder one for my brothers torture method
but there wasnt enough premeditated evidence
they clearly focus on the computer
highlighted is the sentence there might have been if i testified
only when he hits the delete key does it disappear
he continues typing
continuing over the next year wed lose our house and the rest of our fathers pension to attorney fees
much to all of our surprise
stood by derek
dannys interrupted by a loud knock on the front door
he looks through the peephole and sees its chris and jason
he sighs in relief and opens the door
were here dude
drop your dick and grab your stick
i told you i cant tonight
from the couch danny
its okay mom
the two punks laugh as danny pushes them and their boards back to his bedroom
he shuts his bedroom door
danny looks at the two
if i dont finish this thing im dead
just tell em youll do it tomorrow
you cant miss the party
fire pie lizzy called and told us to grab your ass
nodding you gotta hit that shit
its the only fun thing thats legal anymore
the phone rings and danny grabs it
the only illumination shines through the window from the street
holding his briefcase he stands over his desk phone all packed up and almost out the door
worried whats going on
is everything all right over there
hows it comin
im doing it right now
who is it dude
covering the receiver its sweeney
why is he calling here
fuck you sweeney
grabbing the receiver get a fucking job you reggie
danny grabs the receiver back and yells at his friends
you fuckers are going to get me booted
into the receiver dr
im sorry man
just make sure its on my desk tomorrow danny
itll be there alright
it better be
sweeney hangs up abruptly
danny slams the phone on the hook gives it tme finger and looks at his friends
a truck sits across the street
they sit in the car as a band jams from cams house
shiftless seth throws on a black cro mag t shirt and tosses his work shirt in the back
he wolfs down a burger as derek rolls his foot on a basketball on the floor
youre an idiot if you ask me
im not asking you
what if he writes something stupid and that nigger turns you in
he didnt testify der
they can use that shit and re try you
derek takes a long stare at seth who devourshis burger
sweeneys not gonna do anything seth
he helped get me released
seth is a pathetic vision to derek
derek stares at him for several moments
im out seth
seth wipes his mouth and casually meets eyes with derek
im only going to tell you this once so pay attention
im done seth
i dont want you to come near me
i want you to leave my family alone
seth stares and laughs at derek
im dead fucking serious
no more phone calls no more visits no more nothing
seth doesnt know what to say
we dont exist as far as youre concerned seth
i cant believe im hearing this shit come out of your mouth
believe it seth
i spent over three years away from my family
my family seth
for your country fuckhole thats what
id do a hundred years before i felt like that
seth gets out slams the door and walks to the party
youre a motherfucking traitor
derek stares out the window and sighs
he watches the house
suddenly danny chris and jason skate up to the residence and follow seth inside
dick nixon plays a punk version of white christmas as skins slam dance
his face is tattooed with crows feet and prison ink
cassandra a frail older english woman with green hair and multiple piercings approaches jason at the keg
youre full of shit
if he aint here hes comin
chris danny and jason pound beer and huck darts at a picture of o
seth violently slams past the kids
derek walks in
whats up fat seth
seth throws chris against the wall
im not fat cockwart
im sorry bro
take it easy dude
seth then grabs danny hard by the shirt
chris and jason stare at him like hes gonna hurt him
whatre you doin
your brothers a piece of shit
seth sees derek enter and he releases danny
seth mixes into the party and slam dances into ten other skins
danny follows seth towards the keg
he analyzes the crowd
quickly chris recognizes him
son of a bitch
derek looks at the two kids
im jason and thats chris
were friends with your brother
they stick out their hands but derek prefers to check the scene
youre a fuckin god man
do me a favor
grab danny and get outta here
the two boys look at each other and laugh
we just got here man
chris looks at derek like hes dead
you dont have any homework
school doesnt exist anymore father
derek stares at him not really knowing what to do
i wrote you
two letters while you were in there
did you get them
derek ignores them and weaves his way through the crowd causing many an individual to double take
chris and jason look on in wonderment
tight on cammeron alexander
the older white trash skin furiously bangs his sticks on the drums to the song
cams hair is still long but now hes got a swastika between his eyebrows like charles manson
he wears troy aikmans dallas jersey and a black cowboy hat
he pans right to check out the crowd
a man pisses out the window
then to a distinct woman
her head is now completely shaved but shes still gorgeous as ever
derek indulges her for a few moments until he turns and walks away
he bumps into a girl and knocks her drink
excuse fuckin me
she smiles at derek as the song comes to a close
oh my god
they said you might be here but i didnt fucking believe em
curtis the m on the side of his head perfectly intact walks by derek
he walks past derek with his young son on his shoulders
i hope what i heard aint true man
you better hightail it the fuck outta here if it is
after a moment derek looks away and curtis heads off
you gotta chop that mop der
cassandra lights a brown menthol cigarette
exhaling staceys meandering around here somewhere
have you seen the bitch
derek shakes his head
the only person ive seen is seth
he sees cameron puts his arm around her and kiss her
cameron sticks his hand down the back of her pants smiles pulls it out and licks his finger
derek watches as danny delivers a beer to cammeron
ca puts his arm around dan and they go into the bedroom
stacey looks at derek and follows them
are you going in there
derek looks down to see lizzy and kammi
can you tell danny that lizzys looking for him
derek can only stare at the girls youth
he stands in the doorwell and listens
white power paraphernalia cover the walls
articles posters everything
the room has a bed a couch a glass coffee table and a desk with a computer on it
organized stacks of papers pamphlets and magazines are strewn throughout the floor
cameron sips a beer and talks with dan
stacey listens in the background
he wont do anythingdrastic i hope
i gotta do that paper though
i thought you already turned that fucker in
my teacher cried to sweeney man
have to do another one
chiming in meanwhile niggers and spics do their reports on malcolm x and fucking fidel castro
cameron laughs again but then becomes quickly serious
sweeneys got an agenda danny
and its all a load of crap
you hear me
hes all about brainwashing
dont get fucking fooled by it
what the hell are you doing here dan
they all look over
i was wondering when he was going to show his face
derek doesnt lift his eyes from danny
what did i tell you dan
i had to check it out der
hell be all right derek
derek shoots cameron a look and tries another way
theres a redhead out there looking for you
go talk to her
danny gets up and walks out
cam looks to stacey
you go with
derek seizes his brother with the eyes as he exits
he just closes the door on her
cammeron looks for his cigarettes
you made it man
when i heard they threw you in general population i thought it was curtains
it wasnt too bad
so whats all this self righteous born again shit im hearing then
derek doesnt blink
cameron smiles and points to a chair
have a seat derek
tight on cammeron
he sparks up a cigi to break dereks uncomfortable stare
how was it in there with all those fuckin monkeys man
youre lucky they didnt kill you
who runs the place
the monkeys or the wetbacks
its a fuckin vacation for them in there hunh
they were really organized
ill tell ya

they the two make out
she sits on the sink and wraps her legs around him
they stop and smile at each other
i like you

derek and cam converse over the coffee table
theyre fuckin peasants derek

cameron smiles but doesnt know what to say
i had to distance myself from you after that
fuck you cameron
youre a fucking chicken hawk
praying on kids
i dont pray on fucking anyone

to filter your insanity
cameron smiles in disbelief
you and danny are like brothers to me derek
come on man
hes not your brother cameron
hes my brother
after a beat you hear me cam
exploding fuck you derek
dont think you can threaten me with this shit for a fuckin second
im more important to him now then you ever were
with his feet he pushes the glass coffee table hard into cammerons knees
cam screams in agony
derek slugs him in the face and cam retaliates with two of his own
they wrestle around the room and push their way into the bathroom
derek takes cam by his long hair and smashes his face into the mirror
derek follows with a solid punch to the kidney
you gonna listen
im gonna fuckin kill you
derek bangs cams face against the mirror once more
shut the fuck up
youre gonna stay away
thats what youre gonna do
derek rinses cams bloody face off by plunging it into the toilet
he pulls him back up and they face the mirror
derek stares at him in silence
he forcefully backs derek into the wall behind him
he throws two punches at derek one in the stomach and one to the face that opens his lip
he misses on his third and derek gets the upper hand
back to the mirror
derek prepares to crash cams face into the shards of glass one last time
the final blow
as cam screams derek launches him forward then pulls back at the very last moment
derek noticing cams condition throws him into the tub
derek throws him a towel grabs one for his lip and exits
they salute the band and chant as they tune up for another set
the singer inquires about his drummer
derek pushes his way through and spills a few beers cn the way
cassandra smokes a cigarette with a few random skins as derek passes by
exhaling jesus der
psychotically wheres cammeron man
i havent seen him
cassandra looks at him curiously and then focuses her attention to the bedroom
derek turns around and faces her
pointing his finger stay away from me
dont point your fucking finger at me
im serious stacey
she grabs and pulls on his shirt
what are you gonna do
kick me as i roll on the fuckin ground screaming
then that bullshit with cammeron is nothing derek
i dont care
stacey looks deep into his eyes and can feel it
goddamn you derek
those two niggers deserved what they got
they deserved to die
and just like cameron and seth and a million others out there
ill believe that til the day i fucking die
nothing will ever change that either
derek breaks from her grasp and walks away
he looks over to the kegs
through the sliding glass window he sees seth taking a tap hit off the keg
all the guys in the b
including danny count and cheer
seth sucks the tap while skins count in the background
derek walks out and watches dan pump the keg
seth removes his mouth from the tap and belches like a pig
all the guys laugh
grabbing danny why the fuck did you pump it
i coulda gone for a minute at least
danny looks over and meets eyes with a bloody derek
he freezes while everyone turns to look derek over
let him go seth
seth sees blood on dereks face and shirt and takes a moment to identify the source
he draws his mm baretta and points it at dereks head from four feet away
derek stares directly into the barrel
frightened seth man
seth puts the gun directly to dereks cool head
id be doing america a great fucking favor let me tell you
do it seth
seth glances at her and derek quickly grabs the pistol
a shot goes off and people hit the deck
derek wrestles the pistol away and punches seth in the stomach
falling to the ground in pain derek cracks him in the face once more and its over
they walk in and look at cammeron bleeding in the tub
curtis pulls the metal towel holder off the wall and storms after derek
you got fuckin guests out there cam
derek tosses the gun over the fence and looks to danny
come with me right now
he looks at his brother
he then sees curtis and three other skins come through the house
derek stares at dan and hauls ass down the back alley
curtis arrives and tends to seth rather than go after derek
confused and mildly embarrassed danny bolts back into the house to get his board
danny passes them on his board as he conguers the cracks in the street at an incredible rate
he turns the tight corner and cuts off a turning car
the man yells
danny spots his brother walking twenty yards up on the left hand side of the street and crosses
approaching quickly he skates faster and faster as derek nears a bus stop bench
hearing the board derek turns to face the clickity clack behind him
danny lunges from his board and tackles deree
the two crash into the street as a car henks from the inside lane barely missing the duo
danny punches his brozher in the face
derek gets on top of his brother spots a speeding car heading right for him and pulls his brother to the sidewalk
just in time
what the luck are you thinking
what are you thinking
friends dont fight friends der
they stick together
theyre not friends dan
what the hell are they then
derek picks his brother up and sits him on a bus stop just sit there and relax for a second
i dont wanna relax
you looked like an idiot back there
derek stares and sits next to him
cars and homeless randomly pass in the b
danny looks at his brother transfixed in thought
whats happened to you derek
tight on derek
he looks into his brothers eyes
the morning drill
his roommate an old latino guy right behind
dereks eyes cast among the inmates noting everyone and looking for a friendly face
he notes a familiar tattoo catches the guys eye and nods
derek with his tray
a sea of tables divided by race
he spots a tiny island of white guys at a distant table
he looks at stevie the leader but gets a nod from the huge aryan next to him
derek moves to sit with them
from a distance he approaches the aryan corner
they casually greet each other
derek then looks over to the huge aryan from the cafeteria and to stevie mccormick the crazy looking leader
derek walks over and shakes their hands
derek quietly folds towels with a young chattering black man
you got lucky man
i was in the kitchen for a year before making it in here
pots and motherfucking pans
disgusting beef stroganoff shit
boiling hot water
looking over my names lamont man
derek doesnt even look at lamont
stone cold he continues folding
i got your back
righteous white cracker with attitude
just like the judge who sentenced me man
lamont laughs but then becomes serious
if your smart though youll remember one thing
youre the nigger in here
he sees stevie mccormick conferring with a mexican gang leader
the mexican hands stevie a joint through a handshake
derek turns and talks to two white guys who seem impressed
stevie walks up and takes a hit off his joint
i was just talking about you
youre cammerons boy
derek turns and stares at him
no i dont think so man
im not anybodys boy

nooo i dont know what you mean
derek and stevie lock eyes
stevie sneaks a hit and offers derek
relax and have a hit
derek stares at him
how about you getting that fucking shit awax from me
stevie looks at him ready to kill
the other two cant believe dereks gall
you got a problem man
do i have a problem
no i dont have a problem
do you have a problem
stevie stares at derek and walks off
he turns back again and he and derek lock eyes
he walks back to his group
who the fuck are you
derek turns back to the other two and they are already walking away
derek looks at the two and back to stevie
stevie sits with huge aryan and says something to him
lamont in mid conversation
but i wont go down on that shit
no way no how
you ever been with a soul sister
derek looks over and meets his eyes
lamont sees this and laughs
just for a second
forgot who the luck i was talking to there for a second
after a beat let me ask you this one though cause i dont know the white mans take
you like eating pussy
derek cant help but smile
you sick fucking bastard
you sick pig
and you dont
you dont know shit about the brothers
we wont go down on that shit if the bitch was holding a gun to our fucking head
derek laughs and the two continue to converse
a group of white aryans are gathered in the yard
derek plays basketball with a mixed assemblage including lamont
derek continues to look over every now and then at stevie and his group
stevie suddenly smiles towards derek
not understanding what its all about derek turns around
standing there is huge aryan and his stocky friend
they proceed to beat the shit out of derek right in the middle of the court
the players circle as derek rolls on the ground
he gets bombarded with kicks and punches a few even coming from randoms on the court
a beat up derek quietly folds
lamont stays quiet
he glances over but knows derek isnt in the mood
derek looks over to the white table and they something amongst themselves
they break into laughter
derek thinks about eating somewhere else but theres nowhere to go
he walks back over to the white table and looks at stevie
hows your face man
derek sits and eats his tail between his legs
thatll teach you
dont be a prick to your superiors
stevie walks by himself and smokes a cigarette
he turns a corner and standing there waiting for him is derek
derek stares him down
what do you want
im right here man
you wanna have it out with me lets go
just me and you though
you are a stupid motherfucker
you know that
when are you
derek cracks him in the face and stevie falls to the ground
you have anything else to say you little pussy
derek kicks the man a few more times and takes off
a few black prisoners laugh at stevie from the ping pong derek puts his head down under the warm water and closes his eyes
from out of nowhere he is slammed out of frame to the floor
huge aryanand his stocky buddy from earlier proceed to beat him
bathers leave and after a few moments stevies boys drop their towels
well well well
derek lies on the tile floor bloody and beaten
you aint so tough now are you
the two men smile at each other kick him and exit
after a few seconds lamont enters with the cart and picks up dirty towels
he spots derek laying on the tile
what now man
he tends to derek
he picks him up throws him over his shoulder and carries him off
carrying him hang on to me man
derek lies on a table silent
a mexican doctor examines his ass
well you do have some tearing down here
im gonna have to stitch you up so ill be back
the doctor passes dr
sweeney on his way out
derek hears sweeney talk to the doctor and turns his head
the two look at each other for a long moment
sweeney sits down next to him and puts his hand on dereks shoulder
derek finally breaks down and sobs
sweeney and derek in mid conversation
a small lamp shines off their faces
honor and loyalty run thick derek
not skin color
skin is thin
i dont get you man
after a beat i got my doctorate in education
not in medicine
but if you think babies come into this world evil
youre fucked up derek
youre way to smart to believe that shit
then theres nothin more beautiful derek nothin more pure nothin more innocent
than a baby
they killed my father sweeney

what are you gonna do
seek revenge your whole life and become a lifer in here
thats what these guys are like you wanna be like them
fucking little boys in prison
none of your guys back home give a shit about you
after a beat they only care about your brother
the new blood
and he sure as hell cant take care of himself like you could
derek looks at the man with regret
get me outta here sweeney
sweeney looks at the young man heavily weighing his options
the two lock eyes
derek reads by himself on the cement stairs by himself
a shadow approaches from behind
how you doin man
derek turns his head and sees lamont standing there
after a beat how are you
im fucking incarcerated man
with a bunch of faggots
how you think im doin
derek looks at the young man and cant help but laugh
derek slowly gets up and limps past lamont
what are you gonna do man
derek looks at him for a few moments still shaken
im not going to do anything
he looks through the window at his mother
together they pick up the phone
tight on derek
he can feel her pain more than he can feel his own
he forces a smile
the two sit there and stare at each other for a few moments
sweeney called me
he spoke with a guy on the parole board here
then he thinks you might be getting out soon
derek nods and stares at his mother broken
how are the others
ucla math major
frustrated all three of you have always been so great in school
i wonder why all this what about dan mom
hes doing the same stuff you were doing derek
hanging out with cammeron getting into trouble
it brings back a lot of sad memories
and i cant do anything
he wont listen to me
he needs you
derek stares at his mother like its the last thing he wanted to hear
derek gives back his prison garb
through the partition we see derek say goodbye to lamont and walk out to his awaiting family
danny tearfully stares at his brother speechless
after a long beat youre my best friend danny
youre my only friend
and i just want whats best for you
the two rub heads as derek puts his arm around him
danny squeezes back and derek kisses him on the top of the head
danny skates up to the front gate and looks at them
how the hell
derek slaps the roof on the passenger side and scares the hell out of the officers
son of a bitch
pretty shitty assignment you got
out of respect for your father
what the hell do you know about my father
the two men sit there speechless as derek walks over to an awaiting danny
she snores on the couch
the clock on the wall reads eleven as the boys enter
danny goes to his room whale derek heads for the girls in the living room
he genzly shakes davina
she looks at him delirious
time for bed
dan types at the computer as derek escorts davina and doris to bed
davina plops herself down and falls asleep instantly
derek stares at himself in the mirror
a million thoughts race through his head as computer keys echo in the b
he looks at all of his tattoos and scars
tight on his upper body
he stares at the swastika on his tit
he puts his hand over the tattoo to see what he looks like without it
he turns on the shower and gets inside
as he soaps himself down the soap slips out of his hand and sits on
the bottom of the tub
he looks at it a long time before he bends over to pick it up
he immerses his face into the shower faucet and thinks to himself
he sits back down at the computer and looks back at his brother as he dries off
danny thinks to himself and types a sentence
there was only one person who loved derek more than me
the place is immaculate
dennis vinyard the father of the household eats his breakfast in his la county firefighter uniform
vintage fireman material muscular receding hairline zero facial hair
a pretty and well dressed doris sings while she scrambles eight eggs with mushrooms and peppers
that was dad
they were best friends
fathers and sons are never best friends
but they were
younger danny stares at his larger than life father with a cap turned backwards
doris breaks from song and yells to the back
lets go davina
so whats this all about dennis
dennis doesnt hear because his attention is on danny
younger derek donning a flat top haircut and no tattoos walks into the kitchen
the smiling athlete has his backpack and blue venice high gym bag
he drops it all onto the ground and sits at the table
doris sets food in front of her two sons and they both go to work
young danny eats quietly
what about this gang stuff
its not that big of a deal
all departments have to take a precaution class on gang patrol today
a guy was shot yesterday in inglewood
changin a valve on a hydrant
lapd is worried that more firefighters will become targets
thats what this bullshit is about
sipping his coffee a good father this guy was though and now hes in intensive care because of some goddamn
theyve pretty much declared war on lapd and us
why you guys though
i can see them but the fire department
they think we would rather let a building burn down over there than fight it
so now we got two fights goin on at one goddamn time
dennis takes a bite of his eggs and explodes
to the bedroom dayins
get in here
im coming right now
ill tell you one more thing
this affirmative blaction shit is driving me up the fucking wall
firefighters gettin s on their tests while rappers who score a goddamn walk away with the job
dont we have to have affirmative action
not when a job requires ability
a lot of people say otherwise danny
a lot of people dont know shit either
doris just stares at the back of her husbands head like she wants to smack it
he turns back and disarms her with a look
if im fightin a brush fire
surrounded by thousand degree flames
who would i want watchin my back
a guy who scores a or a guy who scores a sixty
then you dont see half the nba with whites gooks and spics
what you dont see are minorities on the boards of fortune companies cause whites wont stand for it
im tired of your damn argument
you sound like an idiot
sweeney actually had a pretty good take on affirmative action the other day
i didnt know you spoke african derek
whered you learn that shit
dennis laughs and derek eventually smiles
danny looks at them not really understanding
doris stares down dennis
please dont speak that way
they dont how am i speaking doris

dont let that him confuse you over there derek
look at me
this shit hes pulling is a load of crap
look at me derek

if we keep givin niggers everything therell be nothing left for us
derek and danny stare at their father not knowing how to react
you can be a stupid son of a bitch sometimes
and then we have naive fools like her
i really hate you with a passion some times
an upset doris exits the room past young davina
dennis looks to derek
you know what i mean though right
to the family good morning
her lips glare excessively this morning
good morning miss monroe
smiling look at you
you look like a star
i like that color davina
thanks you did like it
dennis reaches over and wipes it off with his napkin
whining come on dad
well youre lucky im letting you wear that crap on your eyes
i love you but youre too young
that sucks man
it totally sucks
and we all sympathize with you too
everyone laughs but dan still shaken over his mother
shifting to danny you got practice today
danny shakes his head no

quickly to derek santa monica high tonight right
to danny benll whip us up a couple of double deckers and well head over
dennis smiles reaches over with a fatherly hand and messes up his hair
he stops typing and almost cries
he leans back in his chair and and stares himself in the side mirror
he feels his bald head almost exploring
a white homeless man in an army jacket sits outside begging for change
seth and cameron both beat up drunk and bloody stare at the man
spare change for a cheeseburger
get a job and buy one why dont you
god bless you
seth stumbles into the shop
cam stares at the homeless man psychotically
fifty cents is all i ask
i was in really
so youve had what
thirty years to get your shit together
all i want is something to eat
there are plenty of fuckin dishwashing jobs out there vietnam boy

in the background ben the owner and seth shake hands

youre a disgrace to the white race
if adolf hitler was alive
god bless his soul
he would have you shot
fuck you then
now and forever
cameron knees the weaker man square in the face
the man slopes down to his side unconscious
as an afterthought cameron kicks him several more times
quickly to across the street
little henry and two of his friends watch cammerons brutality from their bikes
they turn in the opposite direction and hurry off
seth eats a burger and chili fries at the same time
cameron smokes across from him and watches seth eat like a pig
he takes a look at the homeless man outside who still lays motionless
cam feels his bandaged face
i think i need to go to the hospital
i dont know
i think so
who gives a fuck
seth takes a bite and chews
dereks a fuckin traitor pussy
we might be pussies too if we got treated the way he did
what do you mean
stevie mccormick called
old school venice bro

he hated derek
exhaling said he was a fucking blow up doll in there
overwhelmed fucking a
seth continues to eat
cammeron looks out the window and hates what he sees
you gotta be kidding me
a large mature and sharp looking black man helps a beautiful blond out of a red bmw
cammeron is at a loss for words
cam puts out his cigarette as the couple enters
looking at the two is there anything sacred in this country anymore
stop feeding your face for a second and look behind you
seth turns his head and stares at the interracial couple
he turns back to cam and sings a verse from the famous atevie wonder song ebony and ivory
the black man turns and looks at the two
can we help you with something
do you have any questions about the menu
i recommend either the big ben burger or the chicken taco special
benll replace the dark meat with the white meat if you ask nicely
fed up whats your problem pal

you got a fuckin death wish asshole

if you dont
get the luck out of my sight
cause im real close to shoving my piece up your girlfriends stinky pussy
the black man stares at the gun sticking out of seths belly
he grabs his girlfriend and walks out of the joint
seth sits back down and the two laugh
cameron looks over at ben and raises his hands in the air
smiling everythings hunky dory ben
only us white folk
it reads a
shiftless derek lifts a sleeping danny off the computer keyboard
he helps him into the bottom bunk tucks him in and watches him snooze
softly did you save it
an asleep danny nods
derek slowly walks back into the bathroom to grab his towel off the floor
he looks at his swastika tat in the mirror and sighs to himself
he turns off the light and exits
seth finishes his display of gluttony
it wouldnt irritate me so much if the ratio was a little more even
going mad ebony and ivory back there
almost all of those orange kid relationships are black man and white women and im fucking sick of seein it
i wouldnt mind so much if it were more even
huge dicks cam
thats all it is
i used to think that too but
its gotta be more man
it has to be more than the fact they they carry a big load
chicks arent that shallow are they
its politically correct
thats what it is
bein seen with the coloreds

bitches today want to be known as bein fuckin color blind
they get off on it
and you cant really blame tyrone
why the fuck not
howd you like to drag around some fat fly girl
imitating oh go girlfriend

seth and cammeron laugh and head outside leaving a mess on the table
the white vehicle gets passed by cars left and right
henry sits up front with jerome nervous and scared
the three thugs in back lock and load
you gonna waste em
only if we have to
jerome grabs a baseball bat and they quietly get out
me bites his nails and watches the foursome sneak up on an oblivious seth and cammeron
the men close in
seth and cam are blind to it
jerome raises the bat as they close in and we danny stares at himself in the mirror and tries to find some stubble on his chin
he stares into the mirror in a coat and pants
danny rushes to get his things together
im printing it up and were out of here
derek walks out into the living room
shes on the couch watching cartoons
she takes a jar of vicks vapor rub and puts some on her chest
derek walks in the room bends over and kisses her on the forehead
davina sits on the couch and writes
derek just smiles
i gotta see my parole officer
do you have excel on disk
ive got everything on disk
davina smiles and walks into the back bedroom
doris looks at derek
you look good
derek smiles and caresses his mothers cheek
were getting out of here soon
is that okay with you
id love it
after a beat do you think i should color my hair
he sits beside his mother and enjoys the moment
he thinks to himself
im glad you made it back
i wasnt too sure i was going to see you again
you know how i get
filled with regret he nods
you think youll be able to forgive me
youre my son
of course i will
derek smiles and cant believe his tearful reaction
look at me
im such a pussy
no youre not
derek plunks a quarter down the slot and removes a copy of the la times
danny continues to skate ahead of him
sensing danger derek looks back behind him
with no one in sight he walks into a doughnut shop
he takes a guarded look outside
everything seems normal
a bus drives by
a group of mexican laborers dressed for work and smiling walk past in the other direction
inside a black woman orders a dozen doughnuts from a short korean
man behind the counter
her young daughter grabs her leg
danny sits down and reads dereks paper
what do you want
maple bar and a
derek smiles at the little girl while he waits
she wanders from her mothers leg and over towards derek
to the girl you look pretty
how do i look
he looks up from the paper
he watches the girl together with his brother
whats your name
how old are you tisha
she holds up four fingers
staring at derek come here tisha
tisha returns to her mother and they quickly exit
derek watches the girl as she continues to stare at him as they make their way down the street
outside a blue ford screeches out front
rasmussen and the young mark fuhrman type from earlier get out and wait
sweeney meets the duo and together they walk inside
whats goin on
we need to talk derek
howd you find out i was here
we were just at your apartment
cammeron and seth are in the icu at st
they were jumped in front of bens burgets early this morning
derek thinks to himself for a few more seconds
then they must have been looking for somebody else
derek stares at rasmussen and walks away
sweeney who knows to walk over to him
he eyes tight on sweeney and derek
the two lock eyes
are they coming after you
i dont know
after a long beat you might have to talk to your old crew though
derek looks over and analyzes the innocence of his brother
i cant sweeney
derek senses the danger in his voice
before it explodes
sweeney walks away and then turns back to derek
and watch your back
back to danny you showing up today
danny looks at sweeney and nods his head yes
they are outside the fence surrounding the field
students head off to morning class
keep your head up alright
im going to take care of this
i dont know
ill figure it out though
you gonna be okay
the two stare at each other as the bell rings
i gotta turn that paper in
danny hops the fence with his backpack on
he looks back at derek
cops and sit in their car in the b
derek puts his hand over the fence
danny walks up and clasps it fingers intertwined
derek wants to say one thing but something else comes out
ill see you at home
danny smiles at his brother and nods
danny puts his ear phones on and heads to class
derek watches his brother through the chain link fence
danny meets up with lizzy and they soon disappear from dereks sight
derek turns and walks down the street
you need a lift anywhere
derek stops in his tracks walks back over to the fence and stares at the school
students rush past them
danny kisses lizzy and she hurries off to class
he pushes on the mens room door
danny enters sets his american history x paper on top of the sink and takes an unearthly long piss at the urinal
he finishes flushes and turns
standing there is little henry
a gun in his hand
what are you doing henry
afraid what does it look like im doin
come on man no
you dont want to do this
the door smacks open and danny moves to grab the pistol
it discharges and a bullet rockets into dannys chest
he slams back into the urinal and gasps for air
the force of the pistol knocks henry to the ground
the two kids who just entered bolt for help
danny slides to the tile leaving a bloody trail
the two stare at each other eye to eye
the bloodstained paper falls into the damp sink
danny inhales like glass is raking his lungs
dannys breathing slows to a choked whisper
he blinks coughs twitches
henry watches teary eyed with the same altered look derek had after killing lawrence
together they freeze on the cold tile floor
officers and detectives monitor the area
young students including lizzy and her friends stand around and cry
rasmussen brings the bloody paper over to sweeney
sweeney looks at it for a moment but is interrupted
he wont let go
will you talk to him
derek cradles his bloody brother
sweeney walks over crouches and talks to dereks back
you gotta let him go man
they gotta get him outta here
derek begins to cry outright
he cant control himself
he lets go of dannys corpse and charges out into the hall
derek embraces them
doris grabs his face torn between love and hate
guilt ridden derek tears from them and storms down the hall with sweeney soon in tow
i know what youre thinkin right now and i want you to forget about it
how the luck do you know what im thinkin sweeney
cause im thinkin the same damn thing
drowning in rage derek turns back to a misty eyed sweeney
they shot him in a fucking
and goin after them wont bring him back
dont do it derek
youve come too far
the war is over
derek contemplates the situation and presses his tongue against his teeth crackbrained
sweeney slowly approaches and cautiously wraps his arms around the young man
derek buries his tearing face in sweeneys shoulder
it stops now sweeney
sweeney nods and the two lock eyes
derek makes his way back to doris and davina and together they grieve
weve heard it a million times a bible quote become cliche vengeance is mine sayeth the lord
a still of the two immediately after the murder
we move in tighter and tighter until we get close on danny
vengeance brought about by hate
when it points its head in our direction we take notice and everything changes
the way we choose our friends the way we protect our families the way we create enemies out of strangers
then welcome to america
tight on dannys eyes
they are gently pushed shut by henrys two small black fingers
